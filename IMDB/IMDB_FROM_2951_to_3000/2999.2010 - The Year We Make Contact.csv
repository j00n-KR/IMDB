0,TheLittleSongbird,Interesting if unnecessary,6,21 April 2011,"2010 is not a bad movie by all means. Comparisons to the milestone that is 2001:A Space Odyssey, that I feel is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and sadly often misinterpreted, are inevitable. 2010 doesn't compare to 2001, but does a decent enough job on its own.The special effects here are really quite good and still look great especially when captured so well by the great cinematography and lighting. The direction and script is efficient enough, the music is appropriately haunting and somewhat mysterious and the acting from Roy Schneider and John Lithgow is very good. Also while neither a strength or a weakness, 2010 is in some ways slicker and shorter than 2001, and the Black Monolith which still confuses a lot of people is elaborated upon here.However, while the script has moments of thoughtfulness and efficiency, it also isn't as complex and mysterious with some of the voice over occasionally over-simplistic and also some of the dialogue could've have excised- the beauty of 2001 was that it wasn't about the story or dialogue but more the images, the meaning behind them and the music. The story certainly is interesting, but what hampers it is a certain over-explicitness that is rather banal on the surface, a really simplified religious ending and a lack of the epic sense and ambiguity that made 2001 so masterful.All in all, an interesting film but it is also rather unnecessary as well. 6/10 Bethany Cox",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
1,bkoganbing,Nine Years Later,8,6 February 2009,"It turned that 2001: A Space Odyssey was nowhere near the real 2001 when it finally rolled around. It is devilishly hard to predict the future, it's not the first or the last science fiction film to get it wrong. So with only one year remaining until 2010, the story of 2010 bares no resemblance in any way to the future described except in global tensions and those are of a different nature.Nine years before Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood went into space with a spaceship operated by a computer with issues named HAL to investigate reported signs of life on one of Jupiter's moons. They never returned and their empty ship still orbits Jupiter.The USA gets word that the USSR is sending a team to investigate the ship which is in orbital decay. They want American participation, but at the same time there is a growing war threat over in Central America where the Russians have a new surrogate government in Honduras. The president's science adviser James McEachin persuades the man who sent Dullea and Lockwood to head the American team. Roy Scheider picks as his guys, John Lithgow and Bob Balaban. Balaban is the guy who invented and programmed HAL the computer which went haywire the first time. The Russian team is headed by Helen Mirren before she played the Queen and before she was Inspector Jane Tennyson. They're all scientists, but her team and Scheider's are citizens of their respective countries. But being out in space forces a cooperation that the governments on earth can't seem to grasp.The film comes up with a lot of answers for the questions that 2001 left including the reason for HAL's problems in the other film. HAL also gives this new group some reason for concern in this film. 2010 is more Arthur Clarke than 2001 one was which was Stanley Kubrick's own version of what Clarke wrote in the book the first film was based on. Here director Peter Hyams lets Clarke's more straightforward screenplay speak for itself. The end is a spiritual one, something truly wonderful does happen. It's even somewhat biblically prophesied if you think of a play on the words 'son' and 'sun'. And that's as far as I go in describing the climax.2001 had the actors dwarfed by the spectacle. Here the actors have more to do and they uniformly do it well. Roy Scheider's character seems to be a harbinger for his character on Seaquest DSV. I'm not a big fan of films where the story is sacrificed so I like the Stanley Kubrick film, but not to the degree others do. This film while operating in the parameters set by Kubrick has an identity all its own.It might not be something wonderful, but it is something to think about.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
2,SnoopyStyle,story continuation,6,22 February 2015,"There is superpower tension about the failure of the Discovery mission. Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider) was blamed and he's reduced to operating telescopes in central America. The Soviet ship is ready to launch first, a year before Discovery II. However they need American expertise to assess Discovery. Also the orbit of Discovery is deteriorating and the Americans can't get there in time. A joint American-Soviet expedition is sent to Jupiter to investigate the mysterious failed mission. Floyd is part of the American team along with Discovery designer Walter Curnow (John Lithgow) and HAL designer Chandra (Bob Balaban). The Soviet crew includes Tanya Kirbuk (Helen Mirren) and Dimitri Moisevitch (Elya Baskin). Dave Bowman exists now in a non-corporeal form. They discover something on the moon Europa but they are blocked from exploring it.This is a continuation of the story rather than getting back to the amazing artistic originality of 2001. Without anything ground-breaking, this movie suffers from being too slow. The original 2001 was also dismissed for being too slow by some critics but its artistic marks were never in doubt. The effects and the style in 2010 never leaves the audience in awe. There isn't enough whiz bang and the times have moved on anyways. The story is fine in the Arthur C. Clarke novel but filmmaker Peter Hyams fails to inject excitement into the movie. As is the case sometimes, I am amazed to find Helen Mirren in this movie. Of course, she wasn't a big star back then and there's no reason I would know who she was when I first saw this almost 30 years ago.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
3,ccthemovieman-1,2010: Not A Good Year,3,6 July 2006,"Once again, we see (1) a sequel that isn't even close to the greatness of the original film; (2) Hollywood once again bashing the U.S. government with conspiracy theories; (3) low-class people playing astronauts; (4) another left-wing agenda promoting a secular version of the origin of man; (5) another horrible movie in which John Lithgow starred.Yup, 1 - The original film, 2001: A Space Odyssey is much better; 2 - they claim the government hid something from the good guys and caused the current problem in this story; 3 - in addition, the promote life being on other planets, another ludicrous secular hope; 4 - when have you ever heard a real-life astronaut talk like the dirt-bags in this film (or the ""Alien"" films, Pitch Black, etc.); 5 - I stand corrected: Lithgow actually was good in one movie in his career, but that's it.The only redeeming quality of this movie was the brief scene with 2001 star Keir Dullea, the co-star of the first film. That was a nice touch. Overall: a very disappointing sequel.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
4,rmax304823,HAL Commits Altruistic Suicide.,5,3 March 2012,"The problem with doing a remake of something as incandescently original as Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is that you can't do it.There was something eerie in ""2001"" from the beginning. The lighting carried the director's signature: all the interiors were bright and fluorescent, like a hospital operating room. The musical score was adapted from varied sources. None of the humans seemed at all emotional. An astronaut is indifferent to a birthday greeting from his parents. A man calls his daughter and speaks as if he's at a business conference. Then those man-apes. The sparkling eyes of that leopard. The tapirs in Africa. And it just got more cockeyed as the three or four episodes progressed. Finally, when Dave Bowman was alone in that claustrophobic pod and hurtling through a universe made up of God knows what, there was a powerful sense of his being utterly alone. The last shot -- that Star Child -- well, make of it what we will.It was all ambiguity imbued with some sort of mysticism, as if the film were trying to send us a message in some language we couldn't understand. Here, in the sequel, the ambiguity is turned to platitudinous confusion. This isn't very original. It's a rather standard science fiction movie with generic music, cross-cutting suspense, a familiarly and dramatic lighting style, arguments between crew members, mysterious messages from Bowman's spirit about something being about to happen. Oh, what, we ask? ""Something wonderful."" It's full of non sequiturs that seem pointless, inexplicable. An old lady is brain dead in the hospital and we suddenly see her sitting up, smiling, a floating brush going through her hair. What this incident -- or any OTHER given incident -- has to do with the banal ending is anybody's guess.No, I wouldn't have wanted to be hired to write this story for the screen. Failure is built into it, regardless of the admirable performances. How can you improve on ""2001""? Well, if one awesome monolith is pregnant with significance, how about ten thousand of them? Yes, a whole sky full of monoliths, all of them meaningless.The space ship team is made up half of Americans and half of Soviets. The Soviets are at first surly and uncooperative. (This is 1984.) But one of them is a kind of nice guy with a sense of humor, capable of wise cracks, willing to learn American slang expressions. A task is a ""piece of pie."" Lithgow corrects him, ""piece of cake."" Later the Russian refers to something as ""easy as cake."" ""Pie,"" says Lithgow with a smile. Neither the Russian nor Lithgow know it, although the writers certainly did, that this Russian has a long and familiar cinematic line of descent. He's a descendant of all those Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Germans who learned to speak English in earlier movies, an English with a Southern accent or larded with expressions like ""beat me, Daddy, eight to the bar."" Sometimes they play a ukulele.I don't think I'll give away the ending. No, I won't. In fact, I couldn't if I wanted to because I can't put the jigsaw puzzle pieces together into a recognizable picture.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
5,Tweekums,Oh my God; it's full of stars!,8,8 December 2012,"Several years have passed since the loss of the Discovery near Io; the ship is still there in orbit but there is no sign of life. A second US mission is due to head there to find out what happened but an earlier Soviet mission will get there sooner. The leader of the Soviet mission approaches the leader of the original Discovery mission offering them three places on their mission. This isn't an act of détente but a logical step as only the Americans know how to restart HAL, the ship's computer. As they head towards Jupiter tensions between the US and the USSR rise back home in a way that could ultimately affect the mission. When they arrive they see something strange on Europa; signs of life! Something doesn't want Europa investigated though as soon after they see signs of life the probe is destroyed and their recordings erased. HAL isn't the only member of the original crew they meet; Dave is also there; or at least the person who used to be Dave he isn't the person he was before though. As they prepare to return to Earth something strange starts to happen to Jupiter meaning they will have to put aside national differences if they are to leave before it is too late.This sequel to the iconic '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a very different film; the story is far more conventional with a larger cast and a more obvious sense of what their mission was. The cast also contains better known actors including Roy Scheider, John Lithgow and Helen Mirram; these actors, as well as the less well known ones, did a fine job. There is more excitement here as well as more tense moments. Strangely this film has dated more than the original since the Cold War is long over and it plays a large part in driving the plot here; we also see more use of some very dated computers! This isn't an important film like the original but it is well worth watching; I think it would be possible to enjoy this even if you haven't seen 2001 although I'd certainly advise watching 2001 first if you can.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
6,Quinoa1984,My God - it's full of answers!,7,28 March 2019,"A fascinating point: this is a sequel to 2001 that would not have this production design without coming after Alien (and in other ways too Hyams I think, consciously or not, was influenced by it- Helen Mirren has Ripley hair and arguably her attitude, if Ripley were a Russian officer in space- not to say it was uncommon, but it's what it is), yet it is still very much a sequel to 2001, so I really loved looking at this film for that hybrid aspect. This may also be as a result of having an Alien-like premise, of a rescue mission gone awry. Everything aesthetically, from the costumes to David Shire's peaceful (if not all awe-inspiring) score to Richard Edlund's special effects, are solid gold.Everything about when John Lithgow's engineer goes into space to open the other ship is perfect; he brings a terrified human reaction to it that, frankly, was either missing or subverted in Kubrick's film. However...Hyams great sin is to over explain things. I dont even mean with the film overall as far as answering things left ambiguous or just open for interpretation (though there is that); I mean liken when Heywood Floyd has narration as if it's Star Trek and his Captain's Log to his wife explains things we can already get without it (ie the explanation, really to the audience more than to her, about the ship flinging around the planet, or the thoughts about Europa). I know Kubrick and I suspect someone like Ridley Scott would leave it wordless and the audience would get it, not to mention it would feel more of a piece with 2001 at least in directing terms.And yet, this is a good film when looking at it as a straightforward search-and-rescue science fiction film, what Id assume is a faithful (maybe too faithful) adaptation of Clarke's work, it has an inspiring message about Americans and Russians somehow coming together, and maybe some day I will return to it... But I know it won't be like I do 2001, which worked more like a piece of grand philosophical-psychedelic opera than a traditional film.Oh, and Keir Dullea is terrific here. So is the late Douglas Rain, in particular his performance with Balaban in the climax (that helps to make up for a lot that I had issues with, it's actually a wonderful arc that HAL gets to complete that I didn't even realize was an arc until it happened like it does).PS: Sure, write off Squirt, Heywood's daughter from 2001, with one line... But what about the Bush Baby damn it?!",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
7,wes-connors,The Sequel Proving Less Is More,5,11 December 2008,"""A new time, a new odyssey, a new chance to confront the enigmas arising from the daring Jupiter mission of the year 2001. Crew members aboard the Leonov are on course to rendezvous with the still orbiting Discovery. What they don't know is that they are equally on course for an uncharted realm of human destiny. And their fate will rest on the silicon shoulders of the computer they awaken, HAL-9000,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Yes, they reactivate creepy computer HAL, which is one of many instances where this film errs. In the original ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", HAL (Douglas Rain) was mesmerizing. Herein, ""his"" malfunctions are explained in full; and, the horror of HAL's malicious presence is figuratively castrated. ""2010 (The Year We Make Contact"") takes away so much of the original's mystery and imagination, it is absolutely imperative to see Stanley Kubrick's original ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) first.Cold warring American Roy Scheider (as Heywood Floyd) and Russian Helen Mirren (as Tanya Kirbuk) lead the new mission. Keir Dullea (as Dave Bowman) is a welcome supporting actor, and the always dependable Dana Elcar (as Dimitri Moisevitch) is a treat. Of the crew, HAL's pal Bob Balaban (as Dr. Chandra) provides the most excitement, due to his creepy chemistry with computers.

8,Hey_Sweden,My God. It's full of stars.,7,20 January 2020,"Writer, cinematographer, producer & director Peter Hyams, a filmmaker who's given us some pretty good pictures over the decades, attempts here what must have seemed to viewers of the period to be near-impossible. How DOES one follow up such an iconic science-fiction film as ""2001""? Well, Hyams may be no Stanley Kubrick, but he capably guides through this engrossing story, which he scripted from the novel by Arthur C. Clarke.The Cold War was still in full swing at this time, and American and Soviet governments are on the brink of war while a joint Russian-American mission is launched into space. These astronauts will do their best to probe the mystery of what went wrong on the Discovery spacecraft several years ago. Leading the Americans is likeable Everyman Heywood Floyd (played in Kubricks' film by William Sylvester, and here by Roy Scheider).The most obvious criticism to be made of ""2010"" is understandable, in that it tries to explain as much as possible, taking away from the mystery and enigma of ""2001"". As a result, it's not as provocative or stimulating, and leads to a rather familiar ending for science-fiction films.Still, the film is well paced, and VERY well designed and photographed in widescreen. It may not be a truly great film for the genre, but it is definitely a good one, with a majestic score by David Shire (not a composer typically identified with the science-fiction genre) and a wonderful international cast. Roy is just the right anchor to hold everything together, and he receives strong support from John Lithgow, Helen Mirren (a delight in a real character role), Bob Balaban, Keir Dullea (reprising his role of astronaut Dave Bowman), Douglas Rain (once again supplying the relaxed voice of computer intelligence HAL-9000, who is reawakened), Madolyn Smith Osborne, Dana Elcar, James McEachin, Mary Jo Deschanel (wife of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, and mother to actresses Zooey and Emily Deschanel), Elya Baskin, Jan Triska, Herta Ware, and Robert Lesser. Look hard for author Clarke on a Washington, D.C. park bench.I would agree that this is *not* a weak film. It tells a good story, and certainly held this viewers' attention for the better part of two hours. It's reasonably intelligent fare that will appeal to sci-fi lovers looking for more adult entertainment.Seven out of 10.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
9,LeonLouisRicci,My God It's full of...Itself,7,22 March 2013,"Peter Hyams is an Excellent Cinematographer. As a Writer/Director not so much. This Good Looking Sequel is a sure Disappointment to one of the Greats. It talks itself into Mediocrity and has some really Standard Stuff.There are some Embarrassing Scenes like the heavy breathing, totally frightened Engineer Whining and Complaining in a very Long and ultimately Boring Trek outside the Ship and his companion Freaking out when he smells rotting meat. Oh so Hollywood.There is a Supposedly Tense and Suspenseful Robotic Excursion where nothing is seen and Hardly Explained as ""Something"" is Lurking in that crater. Mostly seen on a Blurry Screen Image. Then there's the Uninteresting Trip to explore the Monolith, and on and on and on.The Cold War Tension is Heavy-Handed and reeks of Fiction. This is Arthur C. Clark's Baby and is here rendered Stillborn in its Platitudes. ""Something Wonderful""...""My God it's Full of Stars"" again and again.

10,utgard14,"""Will I dream?""",8,5 December 2015,"A fine, intelligent sci-fi movie that has the unenviable task of being a sequel to arguably the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. If it's at all possible for you to put aside comparisons to Kubrick's film, you should do so. 2001 certainly didn't need a sequel but, if it had to have one, it couldn't be much better than this. The story has Dr. Heywood Floyd (now played by Roy Scheider) joining a Russian mission to investigate the events of the first film. Basically the movie tries to spell out what happened in 2001 for everybody who didn't get it and provide some degree of closure to the story. It's a different movie than 2001 and, in some ways, a more accessible one. I say that knowing how many people hate 2001 for the very reasons many others (including myself) love it. The script here is not as enigmatic and the direction is less artful. The cast is very good and the special effects are excellent. It's not the experience Kubrick's masterpiece is but it is an enjoyable companion piece. Not necessary in any way but good nonetheless.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

They really seemed to gel together and made this Sci-Fi epic watchable.Of course the draw of this film is the art and set Decoration by Albert Brenner and Rick Simpson; the costume design by Patricia Norris; the visual effects by Richard Edlund, Neil Krepela, George Jenson, and Mark Stetson; the makeup by Michael Westmore; and the sound by Michael J.

I believe that ""2010"" was made to tie up the loose ends and answer some of the questions that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" left.While ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was more a visual movie, ""2010"" actually has many dialog but that doesn't mean that the movie isn't visually spectacular. The sets look beautiful and the special effects also have improved a lot. The story is easier to follow and therefor the movie is more better to watch for a wider range of people then ""2001: A space Odyssey"" was. And I even think that this movie is pleasant to watch even if you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". luckily HAL is still scary even though his role is smaller in this one.

14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Skip this one... especially if you liked the first,6,25 December 2004,"Ever heard of the saying 'ignorance is bliss'? Well, apparently, Peter Hyams hasn't. Despite his own ignorance, he feels that we should be told a thin explanation of everything of the first AND the second film. Despite the first film being visual and symbolic, this tries to simplify every single little thing in the first through basic, I-told-you-there-was-a-simple-explanation-to-it Scooby Doo-like explaining. Why apply cold logic when the first did so well without it? Hyams tries to tell the story in a smart and funny way... failing terribly on both accounts. The guy who brought us the insipid Timecop and the plain awful Sudden Death once again manages to underwhelm us with his unbelievably stupid and quite unneeded explanation for everything that happened in the first. The film never caught my interest, even though I was quite intrigued to hear of a sequel to the visually stunning masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. The plot is dull and moves too slow. The pacing is just bad. The acting is not impressive in the slightest. The characters are poorly written and paper-thin. The film just screams 'Hollywood' from the top of it's lungs, and reeks of it from every single orifice. The language-barrier between the Americans and the Russians is nearly non-existent. The film throws in numerous completely pointless characters that could easily have been removed without impacting the film in the slightest, top of which must be that endlessly annoying kid. The film rationalizes and explains away everything that was interesting in the first. I really didn't see any point for this sequel at all. I urge any fan of the first to avoid it, as it may very well destroy your fond memories of the first. Don't go near this one. I recommend this only to those who watched the first and didn't like the way everything was left a mystery, who wanted to have all of it explained. I would recommend it to fans of Peter Hyams as well, but I doubt(and certainly don't hope) that they exist. 6/10",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
15,view_and_review,Where's My 2019?,9,9 January 2020,"""2010"" is a sequel to ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Though released sixteen years later, plot-wise it was only nine years later. It seems Stanley Kubrick was not a part of this project as the new screenplay writer and director was Peter Hyams--writer of another wonderful space movie: ""Outland.""Hyams wrote a more technically and scientifically sound movie eschewing the more artistic approach taken by Kubrick. I think Hyams did a terrific job considering the obstacle he was up against. Following a legend is never easy. How would you like to be the son of Michael Jordan, Barry Sanders, Willie Mays, or Wayne Gretzky and play the same sport? So much would be expected of you while there would still remain an air of doubt that you could ever reach the heights of your father.""2010"" started with a Russian official visiting Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider), the one responsible for the Discovery mission nine years prior. The two discussed the desire of both countries to return to Jupiter to further study the Monolith there and find out what happened to the astronauts aboard the Discovery. The Russians will get there sooner, but the Americans have the most intimate knowledge of the abandoned Discovery with the HAL-9000 aboard. So, a tenuous alliance was formed.I think ""2010"" had added drama above and beyond ""2001: ASO"" because of the space pact between the Russians and Americans while there was imminent conflict happening on Earth. There was one danger after another the two crews had to contend with climaxing with a final cataclysmic danger that would spell the death of all of them. They had to escape from the orbit of the Jupiter moon, Europa, well ahead of schedule by combining the Discovery and the Russian ship all with the help of HAL (who'd been rebooted and apparently repaired), who seemed to be lapsing back to his old tampering self.It was a fantastically suspenseful confluence of events. There were monoliths forming so rapidly they were consuming the planet Jupiter, there was the issue of fuel and getting back home, then finally the issue of whether or not they could trust HAL. What a rush!If I dare say, I liked ""2010"" more than I liked ""2001: ASO."" This was easier to sink my teeth into and easier to digest. The concepts, the language, and even the objectives were more concrete and easier to understand. Kubrick's movie is the genesis, but who's to say you can't love the offspring even more.

Keir Dullea returns as the missing astronaut David Bowman while Helen Mirren plays the captain of the Leonov. Bob Balaban and John Lithgow also appear as the other two American astronauts.""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" (1984) is realistic science-fiction that's less artsy and more dramatically compelling compared to its predecessor, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). That doesn't make it better, of course, just different. ""2001"" raised questions while this one provides answers, which some people inevitably won't like. The questions include: Why did HAL malfunction? What was the real reason for Discovery's original mission, unknown to Floyd? What happened to Bowman? What is the purpose of the colossal monolith orbiting Jupiter?Both films compliment and counterbalance each other. This one's more of a straightforward space adventure in the near future. Unlike Star Wars, which is space fantasy, ""2010"" is space-oriented adult science-fiction. Star Trek is too, but ""2010"" is far more realistic, which I appreciate. In other words, don't expect any Klingons or spacecraft dogfights.

I always balked at this sequel, which I attempted to watch many years ago but gave up quickly. Finally watching it all the way through, I don't know what exactly I was objecting to so strenuously. I was afraid, I think, that this film would take away the mystery of the Kubrick film. It is true that 2010 is a much more straightforward film, but I'm happy to say it's far from stupid. It's actually quite intelligent science fiction. This film emphasizes a major but often overlooked theme of the first film, the Cold War. In 2010, Dr. Heywood Floyd, here played by Roy Scheider, along with two other American scientists (Bob Balaban and John Lithgow) accompany a ship of Russian cosmonauts (among them Helen Mirren) to the moons of Jupiter on an expedition to recover the Discovery. The movie lacks 2001's sense of awe, but it has its own sense of dread that I quite liked. And while the climax and end are somewhat confusing, it kind of captures the mystery of the original film.

19,Mr-Fusion,A worthy effort,7,12 May 2016,"""2010"" avoids the existential questions that were laid out by its predecessor and goes for the literal approach. Which is a smart move - imitation is not the way to go here. It's pretty straightforward and raises the important narrative questions: What happened to Dave Bowman and HAL9000 during the ill-fated mission? That mystery tugs at the audience from the very pre-credits sequence, and one of the things I love about this movie is finally arriving at Jupiter's moon and seeing the shipwrecked Discovery spinning in place. It's a striking image.Does the movie answer that question? It does, as plainly as possible. And it seeks to leave us with another big scientific development by film's end. This is ultimately a worthy sequel, and the Cold War atmosphere helps add tension. Above all, this is a good cast, and that's what brings me back to this (Roy Scheider has a nice presence here).7/1010",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

23,gbill-74877,"Continues the story, but weakly",5,13 March 2019,"The heart is in the right place here - continuing the story of 2001 of course, and also trying to bridge the gap between America and the Soviet Union. It was made one year after Reagan's 'evil empire' comment and tensions were extremely high, so the fictitious military action in the film that has the world on the brink of nuclear war was certainly relevant. The story has scientists from both nations on a joint operation to Jupiter to find out what happened nine years earlier, and to investigate that puzzling monolith.When I saw this film years ago, I thought it was good-not-great, but decent enough. Watching it again recently, I was bothered a lot more by its flaws, and really struggled with it. The first film is so majestic and poetic, and this one is just standard Hollywood fare - so the difference between the two is night and day in tone and artistry. It tells the next part of Arthur C. Clarke's story and is watchable for that, but just barely.Some lowlights:Heavy-handedness in direction. The film plods linearly along, explaining everything that it needn't, and in the process takes far too long on the ground early on. There are no deft touches. Among other things, we get the Roy Scheider's nauseating narrations to his son to explain what the latest developments are. It's a nice sentiment at the end, but we're hit over the head with it.Poor casting. Helen Mirren as the Soviet commander is the only exception, and I liked her little snippets of Russian (there should have been far more of this though). Scheider and Lithgow are awful.Ludicrous expressions of fear. A female Russian cosmonaut whose presence is otherwise superfluous (minimal dialogue, no defined function) needs to curl up with the brave American (Scheider) during a planned but dangerous maneuver - really? And later we find the American engineer (Lithgow) is afraid of heights and practically pees his space suit while getting over to the old spaceship. Why in god's name would these astronauts be on this mission? It just seems like cheap ways to introduce drama that a better director would have avoided.The monolith exploration. The moment Scheider cautions Mirren that an unmanned probe would be safer and she sends one of her men anyway, we know immediately what's going to happen. Worse yet, after it does, there is literally zero discussion about it, e.g. what just happened, what they might do next, etc ... it's just a discard scene emotionally and scientifically. We get more out of Scheider and Lithgow's subsequent commentary on hot dogs at ballparks than anything about this event. There are many other instances of banal dialogue.It's a joint mission and they're on a Russian spaceship, but it's the Americans and Scheider who dominate. Thank goodness they're there to introduce pragmatism, calm everybody down, see the bigger picture, figure out how to get back, etc.And how are the special effects in 2001 far superior to 2010, when the former was made 16 years earlier? We get none of the slow curved motion, or the drifting. Mostly this one felt very grounded, in sharp contrast to the original.If I try my best to rate it just on its own, without thinking of 2001, I find it just a very average film. I take off an additional half tick for Lithgow's ridiculous anxiety.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

28,freemantle_uk,Really boring...,2,15 May 2009,"... and that is a cardinal sin when it comes for a filmmaker. You need to keep the audience attention.2010: The Year We Make Contact is a sequel to the Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Never has a film never needed a sequel then any of Kubrick's film. Of course, 2010 is set after 2001: A Space Odyssey. The American government know that the Discovery mission to Jupiter was a failure. Dr. Floyd (Roy Scheider) was blamed by the American government and lost his position. The American planned a second mission to Jupiter, but the Soviet Union were about to launch a mission before. The Soviet Union have a problem, they need America's information about the Monolith and be able to access Discovery's computers. They want Americans to join them and in return their would share information and scientific research. Floyd also wants to prove himself and redeem his reputation. Whilst in space the join American-Soviet discovery some strange scientific information about the Jupiter moon Europa. Things on Earth and in space become very surreal with the real of the astronaut, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) who had returned (or may not have) from the space gateway that he went through. On Earth, the Soviet Union and the United States are edging closely to a World War Three, in a Cuban Missile style crisis.The acting was adequate, and this film is a lot more Earth bound then 2001 was, having some political elements to it. That could have been planned on more. But once the film goes into space, it easy to lose interest. The writing, plotting and pacing is poor, and the direction nothing compared to the great Stanley Kubrick. 2001 was a really profound film, with themes of evolution, scientific discovery and man ending up destroying itself. 2010 does not have any themes like that. At best you could argue that it about scientific co-operation, pacifism, the ghosts of the past and a message of peace and new life at the end. But as I said, it is nothing to 2001. The surreal elements of Dave's return even reminded me of the Event Horizan, but not even as good as that film. 2010 also ruins the mystery of the Kubrick classic.If you love the first film then avoid this film. If you have seen it then just forget it (which isn't hard to do). It is a poor film.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

30,ackstasis,"Severe all mental connections with the original Kubrick masterpiece, and this is a good sci-fi film",7,27 December 2006,"'2001: A Space Odyssey' was, put simply, the greatest sci-fi of all time, and, indeed, the greatest film of all time! The masterful Stanley Kubrick was able to intricately craft 141 minutes of unmatchable grandeur and wonderment, telling a complex story so simply that to watch it is to leave one in absolute awe - this was not a movie, this was a life-changing experience. As such, any sequel would have the massive burden of being compared to its predecessor. Any comparison, I'm afraid, would deem '2010' sadly disappointing.However, I must say that I quite enjoyed this film. I'd already severed all mental connections between '2010' and the original, so I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowingly spectacular (in which case, I would have been disappointed like many before me).However, as a completely separate, conventional sci-fi film, I must say I found '2010' enjoyable. The visual effects are great, the acting very good, the original music decent (though it pales in comparison with '2001's famous classical soundtrack - but it was good to hear ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" once again bookending the film. What a great piece!).The only obvious thing that made the film look dated were the scenes set on Earth, a predicament that Kubrick wisely steered clear of. The clothes and furniture of '2010' were one hundred percent 1980s! (However, to be fair, '2001' also encountered a similar problem with those terrible stewardess uniforms). Overall, I rated it a 8/10. '2010' is an enjoyable film, and well worth seeing. Just disregard the fact that it is a sequel to Kubrick's masterpiece '2001: A Space Odysssey,' and you'll do fine.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

All the blame belongs to Peter Hyams, who besides acting as the cinematographer also wrote, directed, and produced the film, and felt compelled to explain everything left (for good reason) unanswered in the original.Worse yet, he explains it in language only a juvenile 'Star Wars' junkie would be impressed with: all state-of-the-art FX and futuristic hardware. There's no magic or mystery, and certainly none of Kubrick's awesome sense of time and space. Hyams instead presents a not very visual screenplay, overloaded with expository dialogue (voice-over letters home from halfway to Jupiter) and constantly hyping itself as ""something wonderful"" (or ""incredible"", or ""fantastic"").Arthur C. Clarke should have known better than to risk a sequel, and isn't that the author himself in an early scene, feeding pigeons outside the White House?

34,rooprect,"It took me decades to appreciate this film, so I hope this review might save you a few years",9,26 May 2021,"We open on a warm, orange sunrise over the colossal radio dishes in New Mexico where our hero, the American scientist George Floyd, is high up on a dish scaffold. A jovial but mysterious Russian scientist appears below shouting a few words of mocking admiration. Floyd responds from his perch, ""Who the hell are you?"" The Russian continues chatting as he slowly lumbers up the steps, and the two strangers trade witty jabs at each other, carefully maneuvering around the subject of the original Jupiter Mission which ended in tragic failure 9 years earlier. The Russian pauses barely halfway up the first flight of steps and says, ""This is very bad for my asthma. You think you could meet me halfway?"" Floyd utters a noncommittal ""Maybe"" but doesn't budge. The conversation turns political as they chat about some ""very bad"" events happening between America and Russia. Then abruptly the Russian says ""Let's play a game called The Truth. For two minutes, I will tell only the truth. And so will you."" Floyd counters with: ""Make it a minute and a half"". The Russian offers: ""A minute and three quarters."" The whole time as we're witnessing this bizarre, comical New Mexican standoff, the camera periodically cuts to a wide shot showing exactly how far apart the two are (physically as well as politically), and how each adversary bargains his way closer to the other on the stairs of this enormous white satellite dish in the middle of the desert.""We are scientists, you and I, Dr. Floyd. Our governments are enemies. We are not.""This is the greatest ""cold war"" opening of any film I've ever seen. And make no mistake, ""2010"" is a film about the Cold War even though it may have spaceships and extraterrestrials and possibly a psycho killer robot or two. In 1984 master director Peter Hyams (""Capricorn One"", ""Outland"") teamed up with the iconic scifi author Arthur C. Clarke (""Childhood's End"", ""Fountains of Paradise"" and the original ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") to bring to the screen a companion film to the amazing ""2001"". If you're a fan of Hyams' style, then don't even bother reading the rest of my review; just go watch the movie. Much like ""Capricorn One"" this movie is a really cool blend of scifi and political thriller. But you shouldn't expect ""Star Wars"" nor should you expect ""The Manchurian Candidate"" because it's not that sort of scifi or political thriller. Like all Hyams films it focuses on individuals, and on that level it succeeds brilliantly. More about that in a sec, first here's the basic plot.The derelict ship The USS Discovery has been spinning wildly around Jupiter's moon Io for 9 years since its mission was abruptly terminated in the 1st movie. There's also this business about a creepy 6-mile high monolith in the general vicinity. Both America & Russia want to get there first and unlock the secrets of what happened, but guess what, the only way anyone can reach it is if the 2 antagonistic countries form a joint mission. And they gotta do it fast because The Discovery's orbit is decaying and it'll burn up with all its secrets.Back to the theme of individuals which Hyams is great at presenting. ""2010"" is a very human film. In that respect it presents a great contrast against the original ""2001"" which Kubrick presented as a very sterile, inhuman experience. In the 1st film nobody showed any emotion, none of the characters really had a soul except, ironically, the ship's computer. Here we get a wonderful array of very human, very warm and interesting characters. The script is full of comedic banter, full of genuine connections between people--whether friendly or adversarial or both, like in that powerful 1st scene. And that's the real magic of this story.Sure, you can watch it for the story alone because that's really intelligent as well as suspensefully presented (tell me your heart doesn't go through the roof during the Europa probe scene. Or the aero-braking scene. Or HAL's ""I think we should abort the countdown"" scene. Double-check the batteries in your pacemakers, folks!). But for my money, I love this film for way it fleshes out each quirky character in this tight, claustrophobic mission to reach the derelict ship. Everyone will pick their own favorite, but my money goes to Bob Balaban who plays Dr Chandra, the socially awkward genius who built--and is responsible for resurrecting--the psycho robot HAL9000. But there's also John Lithgow playing the ""everyman"" engineer Curnow who can't take 2 steps in space without puking but who, along with his Russian counterpart Max, gives us some great human moments and comedic spice. Again, this movie is all about humanity against the coldness of space.First time I saw this movie I thought it was good but ""boring"" (hey I was like 9 years old). I watched it a few years later and liked it a lot. Then I bought the book and read it. Then watched the movie again and loved it. Now, a decade or 2 after my initial introduction to this film, a decade or 2 since I've been exploring cinema and not just Hollywood stuff but obscure gems from all over the world and every decade, I keep coming back to ""2010"" as one of the greatest scifi flicks out there. Here's hoping your odyssey doesn't take as long. There's so much more to this film than meets the eye. Like that opening scene, you can practically write an entire essay on that alone. Egads I think I just did.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
35,ShootingShark,"Dr Chandra, Will I Dream ?",8,30 November 2010,"When a Russian mission to rendezvous with the marooned Discovery spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter is announced, American Dr Heywood Floyd negotiates a place for himself on the trip. Can he find the answers to what went wrong nine years earlier ... ?This is a great movie, sadly overlooked in my view, by science-fiction fans, Stanley Kubrick admirers and cult movie enthusiasts alike. For director Hyams to even conceive of making a direct sequel to Kubrick's enigmatic untouchable classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey, is brave beyond words. To then write, photograph, produce and direct a film which is both an entertaining story and embraces the galactic mystery of its famous predecessor, whilst maintaining narrative consistency, is simply outstanding. This is pure science-fiction of the best literary kind; the ideas are utterly fantastic yet conveyed as realistically as possible. The basic concept of Jupiter as a sun that failed is an incredibly interesting premise, and the depiction of space travel (notably the scene where Lithgow and Baskin spacewalk from one ship to the other) is as ruthlessly authentic as the original. Best of all, unlike a lot of sf, it has great characters with great moral dilemmas. Scheider is fabulous, in one of the very best roles of his illustrious career, as a man seeking redemption - he anchors the whole movie in solid drama, explains everything to us and makes the whole story flow smoothly. There are three great quirky supporting parts from Mirren (as the Russian captain), Lithgow (as an Ordinary Joe) and Balaban (as a scientist who prefers the company of computers to people), and the Russian actors in the smaller parts are great. Add to this the iconic casting of Dullea and Rain and the film's pedigree is complete. Visually, it is simply dazzling, as the Leonov glides into orbit around Jupiter; genius visual effects designer Richard Edlund recreates the red gas giant so convincingly here that you will believe you are in outer space. The film is full of astronomical wonder, mystery, spooky moments, incredible design (Floyd's house is about the coolest place I've ever seen), exciting set-pieces and great performances. Writer Arthur C. Clarke (who appears as the guy feeding the birds outside the White House) wrote a great novel, which takes the key elements of the original movie - the monolith's purpose, the reasons for Hal's neuroses, what happened to Dave Bowman - and weaves a spellbinding yarn around them. Some may say the explanations detract from the enigma of the original, but they don't; this is a different picture, but one that builds upon its predecessor with its own style and a greater emphasis on character. Other critics may put down the anti-military sentiment, forgetting that this was bucking the trend at the height of eighties right-wing Reaganomics. I personally think the dual star ending is one of the most beautiful and touching in any film. I find Hyams almost criminally underrated - he's made some tremendous pictures (Capricorn One, The Star Chamber, End Of Days), but this one is his masterpiece I think.

38,dunmore_ego,A Midget in the Footsteps of Giants.,7,10 April 2006,"No one said it would be easy. Following in the mythic footsteps of Stanley Kubrick and equally legendary Arthur C. Clarke. Maybe it was this inimitable pedigree that gave lowly Peter Hyams the impetus to craft such a reasonably watchable film. *2010: Odyssey Two* is a one-step-forward, one-step-sideways kind of movie.Considering Mr. Hyams is the writer-director behind two films that boast ""scientific"" backdrops, yet lay claim to the most scientifically-bereft story lines of the technological age (*Capricorn One* and *Outland*), *2010* surprisingly retains much hard science in its telling and is consequently a more enjoyable experience for it. Due in full, we must presume, solely to the dogging of author Arthur C. Clarke, who was in constant communication with Hyams through the production process. (Clarke's book of the same name was more or less plundered for initial momentum, rather than adhered to devoutly.) To state the obvious, the story picks up 9 years after Kubrick and Clarke's pioneering and inimitable *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where a joint Soviet-American mission, headed by American scientist Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider) and Soviet Commander Kirbuk (Helen Mirren), is sent to Jupiter to retrieve the abandoned hulk, USS Discovery (found silently spinning in orbit about Io, one of Jupiter's moons), to gather knowledge on the ""failure"" of the HAL 9000 computer and to maybe make sense of Dave Bowman's last intriguing transmission regarding the Monolith, ""My God! It's full of stars!"" As economically unsound as this venture may seem, plausible reasons are given for the mission, but  like they say - you'd have to be a rocket scientist Amid growing political tensions on earth, the Soviet ship Leonov arrives at Jupiter with its mixed crew, Hyams performing a controlled set of vignettes to bring about tension between the crews (initially distrustful of each other), then building the tension around the giant Monolith orbiting Jupiter, which unites the crews for their lives' sake.Though it retains none of the breathtaking poetry and grandiose vision of *2001*, Hyams' lesser vision was aided by spectacular views of Jupiter and Io, thanks to Voyager 1's groundbreaking flybys of the planet in 1979. Mattes of these images are put to excellent use during a suspenseful spacewalk by astronauts Max and Curnow (Elya Baskin and John Lithgow), as they approach the dead Discovery.Though science is bowed to more often than in his previous efforts, Hyams doesn't quite shake off his trademarks of outrageous conceptual anomalies and immutable physics laws treated like arbitrary physics suggestions. (With the Earth and its Moon in the same screen shot, Hyams makes the same sophomoric mistake that most non-credible space movies make when depicting these two celestial bodies which are on average 240,000 miles apart - if they were as close as depicted on screen, not only would tides be generating tsumanis daily, both celestial bodies would have torn themselves apart eons ago or smashed together due to gravitational attraction.) After the Monolith mysteriously goes about its business of doing nothing on a monolithic scale, puny humans pondering its purpose, and after HAL is revived and jovially goes about his business of being unnervingly menacing, Dave Bowman (model mannequin Keir Dullea) appears to Floyd, in the form of a constantly-morphing old man/astronaut/elder, and tells him ""something wonderful"" is going to happen.Only Arthur C. Clarke would have the temerity to blow up Jupiter.Crumbling under the confluence of millions of Mini-Monoliths, Jupiter goes nova and becomes a sun, whilst the Leonov makes a narrow escape. HAL, through the intercession of Dr. Chandra (an ascetic Bob Balaban, perfectly congruent with his typecasting from *Close Encounters* and *Altered States*, but a far cry from the future comedic roles he would perfect with Christopher Guest), becomes sympathetic enough to weep for when he is destroyed along with Discovery.The last scenes of Earth and its twin suns illustrate Hyams' kindergarten comprehension of planetary orbits: we are shown a constant two-sun sky everywhere on the Earth, yet in becoming our newest star, Jupiter (which is renamed Lucifer) has not changed its orbit, nor will it *ever*. Its orbit will appear exactly as it did when Jupiter was merely a planet  that is, it will continually ""cross the sky"" at a different rate than the actual Sun, thereby causing two suns to be in the sky at *ever-changing positions*, or sometimes merely one Sun in the sky, sometimes only Lucifer, sometimes no suns. After this silly sequence, we are immediately jump-cut across the solar system - in an uncharacteristic grandiose sequence - to Europa, the moon of Jupiter that the Monolith, in a final message to Earth, forbad any landings on.And lo, the last frame sets up *sequelae ad infinitum,* as The Monolith makes a cameo on Europa, and the harbinger-like strains of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra crouches and then leaps at us, banging its head on Hyams' lowered ceiling.After all, for midgets, the ceiling can afford to be that low.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
39,emasterslake,A great sequel to 2001.,8,2 November 2005,"This is the sequel to 2001: Space Oddysey. It's taken place 9 years after the events in the previous film.It's taken place in 2010, where you get to see an alternate version of earth in 2010 and the space suits/space stations are more advanced.Has some issues between Russia and the USA, since this was made during the 80s back when the Soviet Union was still in power and America fearing a nuclear war.The special effects in this one are similar to Star wars, Alien, and other films of the 80s. Still very impressive looking to see.We get to learn where Hal 9000 was made. And a journey to Jupiter to find out what happen to the Discovery.Not only is it a sequel but it also has some swearing to make it a PG rated film. Scenes are less long going than the first. And a few music scores from the original.I'd put this on the top ten sequels of all time.Those who like the 2001: Space Oddysey might like this one.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
40,hall895,Some of the answers you never got in 2001,6,16 May 2005,"Nine years after the events of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 back to Jupiter we go. This time around we at least get some explanations of what the heck is going on out there. Where 2001 left you hanging, 2010 comes along to provide some closure. Not all the answers are there. Some things it seems are meant to be forever mysterious. But you will get some resolution, and a much more satisfying conclusion than what we got the first time around. 2001 promised a big payoff and instead delivered just a head-scratching laser-light show and a thoroughly ambiguous end to our characters' long (and I mean long) journey. Here, if your expectations are tempered you should be satisfied by what you get. Certainly no all-time classic but a worthy and generally satisfying effort.When last we left things at the end of 2001 the first mission to Jupiter had ended rather badly. Now a joint American-Soviet crew is sent to find out exactly what did happen last time and to investigate the ever-continuing strange series of events around Jupiter. As would be expected for a film made in 1984 tension between the Americans (led by Roy Scheider) and the Soviets (led by Helen Mirren) is one prevailing theme. This doesn't play as well today but the idea of bitter enemies coming together for the good of humanity never gets old I guess. After the expected tension the American and Soviet crews work well enough together. Until their respective governments get in the way. But eventually the politics is out of the way and we turn our attention to the cosmic questions left unanswered in 2001.2010 suffers from one of the same problems 2001 had. Namely, Jupiter is really far away. It is a long, slow journey and for much of the film nothing really happens. The pace is a bit quicker than 2001 and there is more interplay amongst the crew this time which is certainly welcome. Eventually we get to the stranded Discovery where HAL from 2001 makes a welcome reappearance. HAL's creator, played by Bob Balaban, is along for the ride and delves inside HAL's mind to try to get some answers. But the answers we seek aren't really going to come from HAL. After all, we know what happened to the Discovery the first time around. The questions we seek answers to are more cosmic in nature. And unlike in 2001 our curiosity will be, if not entirely, at least mostly satisfied.2010 is, like its predecessor, slow, even dull at times. Watching it today the whole USA vs. USSR angle is something we could do without. But all in all it is a mostly enjoyable ride, one certainly worth taking. If 2001 intrigued you, 2010 will fill in the blanks and bring some closure. It's a satisfying end to a long, strange trip.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
41,Mister-6,Literally speaking....,2,9 October 1999,"There is a reason why ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is more highly regarded than its sequel ""2010"".  And it's relatively simple to explain.""2001"" explains its story not so much in words as it does in visuals.  So much symbolism, shared thought and personal realization is made throughout the original (especially during the first sequence and the last) that it surpasses mere narrative.  The secrets of the universe are too vast to explain and much too unnecessary to try and understand.  They are that they are, and we are powerless in their grasp.""2010"" tries to have its cake and eat it too: explain everything that happened in the original as well as take us through, step-by-step, what they are doing now.  Did we really need the monoliths' symbolism explained?  No, they meant different things to all of us.  Did we need to have HAL's madness rationalized?  No, even rational thought would waiver in the vastness of the cosmos.Did we need a new visit by a ""reborn"" Bowman (Dullea), assuring us that ""something wonderful"" was about to happen?  No, that would make it appear (as it does) that everything that occurred before was a big buildup for a magician's rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick.I will say no more about what happens.  Suffice it to say that there is every difference in the world between ""2001"" and ""2010"".

43,fernandoschiavi,"2010 is efficient in showing the development of the mission and brings a beautiful reflection on the Cold War, culminating in an extremely optimistic ending",7,29 November 2020,"The film begins by recapitulating the main events of the previous film, 2001 through photos and a background narration. Nine years after losing contact with Discovery 1, the Americans, who count on Dr. Floyd (now played by Rob Scheider), have a chance to find out what actually happened to the ship and his crew, as there is a mission to departure for Jupiter.
2010 delivers excellent fiction and is by no means a profitable film used by MGM in an attempt to profit from the fame of 2001 by launching a sequel that ""promised all the answers"". First the film is based on a book by the same author that 2001 was based on, Arthur C. Clarke. There is nothing more natural than to carry out the continuation, since there is a book that exactly intended to continue embroidering the subject and the same atmosphere in which the previous odyssey happened. It should be made very clear that the film maintains the same interest as the original film and the same level of suspense with a good scientific basis previously aroused, but without Kubrick's genius. But just being in space again and knowing that we are getting closer and closer to getting some answers that have been circulating in our minds for so long, is already an attraction that leaves our eyes glued to the screen. Unlike the predecessor film directed by Kubrick, which left the role of interpreting what he saw to the public, 2010: The Year We Will Make Contact sins precisely for doubting the ability of those who watch. The script, written by Peter Hyams and Arthur C. Clarke, is extremely expository at times, such as in the scenes where Floyd sends messages to his wife describing the actions and risks of the mission.
In addition, the only member of the mission with any kind of development is Dr. Floyd and yet he is explored in a shallow manner, looking like his family has been shown only so that the audience remembers what the protagonist has to lose, being completely ignored in the end. The other crew members have no background, making it impossible for the public to identify with any of them. These problems prevent a great prominence between the performances, despite the good names in the cast, like Roy Scheider and Helen Mirren, who here are only efficient in their roles. In fact, the entire first act conveys a certain haste to present the bases of its history, creating instability in the rhythm of the feature. In just 15 minutes, Americans agree to work with Russians and Dr. Lloyd convinces his wife about going to space, solving their problems very quickly, preventing the public from assimilating the weight and importance of that mission.Hyams and Arthur C. Clarke vaguely explain why the HAL 9000 computer went crazy in the first and part of the mystery of the black monolith, that is, it is didactic, unlike the Kubrick film, which also corresponds to the continuation in book, written by Arthur C. Clarke. It is not surprising that the film is pointed out simply as inferior to the first, without due analysis and perception that it is a work with another style. There is a clear attempt here to bring the audience closer to a space adventure, and Curnow and Chandra's first trip to Discovery reveals this, with a visual refinement by Hyams and work on camera movement and the sound that put the spectator amid the feeling of being in outer space.Another point was the return of Dave Bowman, who is the protagonist of one of the most discussed and uncertain endings to date in cinema. An unnecessary and inopportune scene is that he appears on the television of his ex-wife's house - who since his ""death"" on the mission, remarried - as a spirit from the afterlife. The scene in which Bowman comes into contact with his mother in the hospital bed is also unnecessary and seems to be out of place. Dave's encounter - looking like a spiritual entity - with Dr. Floyd, in which he warns that ""something will happen and the crew needs to move away from Jupiter"", should have a religious context, since Bowman has become a superior entity, which the book treats as an ""apparition"" - in a similarity to that described in the so-called ""Secret of Fatima"" of the Bible.For the time, the art direction work contributed to evoke the events that occurred in the first film, perfectly reconstructing the Discovery ship and bringing the technology of 2010 with the same design as its predecessor, creating a certain linearity between the two features. The visual effects are equally impressive, becoming clear in the exterior shots where spaceships and planets are in evidence. For a 1984 film, the result is not at all disappointing. The viewer sees beautiful external shots of Jupiter and its satellites. The planet is also represented with vibrant colors, revealed by the Voyager mission, a few years earlier. Not only is the journey to Jupiter well built, placing plausible obstacles for the crew to face, but the events that occurred in 2001 are reminiscent of competently in the first scene, where a summary with images and information highlights what happened in the previous feature. The recreation in parts of Discovery 1's interior leads us to really believe that we are on the original ship again.The performances maintain the same level as the first film. Without great performances we see a young Helen Mirren playing a Russian well, in addition to Roy Scheider and John Lithgow just correct on the scene. The conflict between Americans and Russians is another point that today is completely dated, and that is precisely one of the pillars of the film and the book, which emphasizes the strained relations between peoples at that time and reflects a little of the alienation that their populations lived. A critical speech by Dr. Floyd highlights this spirit in the film: ""Just because our governments act like idiots, we shouldn't act like such. We are scientists, not politicians"". Then we still have decisions for the ships to depart separately when the conflict on Earth intensifies, leaving the relationship between astronauts even more strained.
While Kubrick suggested more by means of even poetic images, Hyams creates more evident connecting elements so that the story can be clarified without deviations. One can point out more exactly where the work has aged - mainly due to its theme involving North Americans and Soviets -, however, there is an attempt here to resonate a real science fiction. Hyams' set of pieces is more immersive than many others that would follow, without the same strength. The film's only mystery remains the famous monolith. Not to mention the times when it appeared in the 1968 film, here many of them are responsible for transforming the planet into a star (which shows the idea that they are beings that have developed to the point of sowing life and intelligence in the form of monolith). Later, one of them appears in the middle of Europa's surface. It is impossible to stop mentioning the interesting ending, when Jupiter explodes to become a sun, transforming the Europa satellite into a second planet capable of harboring life with human beings being warned that they should not land there - as if the planet has become the new home. of this alien intelligence. The message is very interesting and the proposed ending is very interesting, sending a message of motivation for the future of humanity, especially in the midst of a Cold War and its consequences, explored throughout the film.This look and cast reach the threshold of the theme addressed by Clarke: that space and the monolith would guard all phases of human life, and when David Bowman resurfaces in different periods of his existence, Hyams offers an almost surreal and ghostly touch, like the virtual meeting with his wife, Betty Fernandez (Mary Jo Deschanel) at the hospital. Not only does Bowman's ghost appear on Earth, it advances over Discovery spaces. Everything in 2010 is more evident. Not only in this sense, but also in the way that astronauts, like Floyd, act - in an instant of danger he embraces a Soviet colleague on his journey. It is an unimaginable scene in 2001. In Kubrick, the feeling is that we are facing a great mystery panel about humanity, in an opera rhythm; in 2010, the balance point is the political and scientific discussion that arises behind the actions of the characters. Still, Hyams is able to elevate his images to something that refers to 2001 in the work of colors and visions. Each of them resembles a great spatial painting: this is what these films seem to have best.Peter Hyams writes and directs with more merit a more commercial film and with a more agile and less contemplative edition. While Kubrick opted for grandiloquence, through plans that highlighted the complexity and immensity of the universe, Hyams uses closed plans most of the time here, creating a sense of confinement and reinforcing the tension between the characters. The soundtrack goes along the same path and, like photography, adds an atmosphere of distress and temerity to the work. Even though it may seem like an offense to produce a 2001 sequel: A Space Odyssey, the film is efficient in showing the development of the mission and brings a beautiful reflection on the Cold War, culminating in an extremely optimistic ending. Of course compared to its predecessor, 2010: The Year We Will Make Contact falls brutally, but, with the exception of Solaris, which science fiction does not detract from Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece?",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

Big mistake as this picture is dreadful. Meant to be a sequel to 2001(A space oddity), 2010 is even worse. Both movies were made at a time when the writers thought they could predict the future and both films are way off the mark. You have to know something about the totally confusing story of 2001 to try to grasp what 2010 is about but quite frankly I gave up after the first few muddled minutes. The movie and its' players are boring and bland and full of their own self importance.

45,russem31,A worthy sequel,8,2 December 2005,"2010: Odyssey Two is a worthy sequel to the classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Whereas the first one was very ethereal, this one is straight science fiction action and must be looked at in that way. Being as that is, I actually like 2010 more than the original only because it is more straight-forward and thus understandable. The Jupiter spacewalk scene is especially spectacular, with the filmmakers having used the recently taken (as of the year 1984) Voyager space probe photos of Jupiter in the late 1970s. There is also a nostalgic reappearance by Keir Dullea who played the original Rob Bowman in 2010. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a love for film.

46,RonellSowes,Unsubstantial Boring Film,3,1 February 2021,"2001: A Space Odyssey had two things going for it. The first was Stanley Kubrick and the second was the groundbreaking special effects which has a lot to with the first. 2010 : The Year We Make Contact had neither of these. Peter Hyams produced, write, directed and shot the film so it's safe to say he's to blame for all its deficiencies. Setting a film in space isn't a enough of a plot and this film tries to be more an experience(like 2001)than a story. Another one of this film's fundamental flaws is how it looks. Much of the ship scenes are very dim but even some of the simplest shots have an odd look to them. And if a picture doesn't look right it's hard to get interested-especially in a plot as weak as this one. When the rest of the picture is so bad all you have left is the special effects. However, there isn't much drama to them and while 2001 had the novelty working for it, this picture came after other film like Star Wars and Star Trek which had much better and more entertaining visuals.2010(I'm going to omit the rest of that ridiculous title)doesn't have any style to be considered art and has nothing to make it entertaining.

48,virek213,Excellent sequel to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY,10,14 July 2001,"Let's be honest.  There will NEVER be another film quite like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY ever again.That said, however, ""2010"" is still an excellent sequel to that great 1968 Stanley Kubrick science fiction masterpiece.  The film, tautly directed by Peter Hyams (OUTLAND) from Arthur C. Clarke's 1981 book ""2010: Odyssey Two"", may be far more conventional than its predecessor, but there is still a great deal about this movie that works wonders.  The always-superb Roy Scheider heads a fine cast in the story of a joint US/Russian space crew investigating what happened to the U.S. spaceship ""Discovery"" and her crew half a billion miles away at Jupiter.  What they find there is eerie and staggering, and the whole situation is further enhanced by the horrible possibility of the two superpowers going to nuclear war back on Earth while the two crews are still in space.Hyams gets very brilliant performances out of his cast, which includes John Lithgow, Helen Mirren, and Bob Balaban, as well as Keir Dullea and the voice of Douglas Rain (HAL) returning to repeat their original roles.Two **SPOILERS**:(1) Yes, under a pseudonym, Candace Bergen is the voice of SAL 9000, seen early on in the film.(2) For those who have the widescreen version, note the man sitting on the park bench feeding the pigeons while, a few yards away, Scheider and another man (James MacEachin) are discussing the Jupiter mission.  That is Arthur C. Clarke himself!Great and believable special effects by Richard Edlund plus an eerie score by David Shire, which of course incorporates Richard Strauss' ""Zarathustra"", help to make ""2010"" a tremendous achievement and a much better film than anyone had the right to expect.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
49,timdalton007,2010: A Space Odyssey Continues,8,19 December 2012,"There are films for which a sequel seems either unnecessary or downright impossible. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey would initially seem to fit into the latter of the two categories. But with the mysteries left by its ending, it certainly left viewers (and readers of the novel by Arthur C Clarke) wanting answers. So when Clarke wrote his own sequel to it, published in 1982, it was perhaps only a matter of time before it would grace the screen. Released two years later, 2010 (later to be given the subtitle ""The Year We Make Contact"") was to be a much different film to its predecessor.One of the biggest departures would be in its casting. Whereas the cast of 2001 was made up of largely unknown actors, 2010 features some well-known actors in its cast. Leading it would be Roy Scheider as Heywood Floyd, the former space administrator who sent Discovery on its mission in the first film and now on a follow-up mission, led by the Russians, in search of answers. Joining him on the mission is his fellow American's John Lithgow as engineer Walter Curnow, Bob Balaban as HAL's designer Doctor Chandra with Russian crew-members including Helen Mirren as Tanya Kirbuk and Elya Baskin as Max. The cast, including its earthbound members such as Dana Elcar and Mary Jo Deschanel, all do adequate performances if nothing spectacular.The true highlights cast wise are the two returning members of the 2001 cast, Keir Dullea as Dave Bowman and Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL. Dullea and Rain are what the gives the film its real link back to 2001 having been, after all, at the heart of two of that film's biggest mysteries. Their performances, despite coming more than a decade and a half after the first film, are nevertheless spot-on. Indeed, the most memorable moments of 2010 involve their appearances. The result then is a satisfying link back to the original without being gratuitous.2010 also looks and feels like a completely different film. If 2001 was the film that gave us an optimistic view of the future, 2010 is the film that tried to combine that with a more realistic guess. That's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because the Leonov, the Russian spacecraft where much of the film is set, feels like a satisfying cross between what we saw in 2001 and something designed by an engineer rather than a film production designer. It's also a good thing because it means that the Discovery from 2001 also fits seamlessly into the film. It's a bad thing because it done something that 2001 hasn't: it's dated quite heavily in places, especially in the technological arena with an over-reliance on mid-1980s computers. Meanwhile, the film's direction and cinematography (both from Peter Hyams) give it a more gritty feeling, the complete opposite of the clean and sterile vision of 2001. For anyone expecting a continuation of 2001's look, it might come as a bit of a shock but there's something brave about the approach Hyams and his production team took in this regard.That brings us to the script and the novel it's based on. 2001 is a film famous for leaving its audience with unanswered questions and what 2010 does (in both book and film) is to try and answer those questions while telling its own story. The last half of that sentence sums up with this film is rather neatly. Yet, for all the questions it answers, the film also leaves some mysteries intact and even creates at least one new one. What the film also does is that it gives us a look into some of the characters on the sidelines of the events of 2001 (such as Heywood Floyd) and what has happened to them since then. Where the script runs into a problem, and where it dates, is in its inclusion of a Cuban Missile Crisis style Cold War standoff subplot that seems almost out of place with the rest of the story. What 2010 does isn't to present a rehashing of 2001 but to continue it, (re)introduce characters, explain some things but above all else tell its own tale.So how does 2010 stack up? Comparing it to 2001, a masterpiece in the estimation of most is perhaps unfair. While telling a continuation of its story, it is by and large a whole different film telling a much different story. 2010 then needs to be judged on its own terms and (it that regard) it is a good film that tells its own interesting story and is enjoyable in its own right.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

It was good and eerie, but I wouldn't call it a film masterpiece. A sequel may have been necessary to explain what happened in the first movie, but this films explanation is to put it mildly is mild.Best part of the film is the acting, fx and cinematography. The pacing is fairly slow, but that's ok. The setup on earth was good and thankfully didn't last too long. It put a human touch to Roy's character. One of the best scenes was when John Lithgow's character and the Russian are in spacesuits approaching the rotating Discovery, very tense, well done. The sling shot of the Russian ship around Jupiter was great. There's some very cool fx shots here.The death of the Russian in the probe could have been better.Worst part is when Bowman's mom in her death bed in the hospital sits up and a comb is combing her hair. Yes, it's Bowman. And it evokes some horror elements, but then it's a dead end, literally. Bowman appearing on TV talking to his wife was better handled. Explanation of HAL going paranoid/psychopath, that HAL was given contradictory order from the US government then what was given to the crew was lame. Really lame. In the first movie this was a mystery, perhaps the aliens controlling HAL. Here HAL is redeemed! HAL even helps the humans after it gets a explanation, and it's ultimate demise. LAME!Then in the end, the aliens turn Jupiter into a small star, turn Jupiter's moon Europa into a habitable planet and create life. This idea is fine. And it also matches what happened in the first movie where the aliens impart intelligence into the early apes. However, the whole production at the end was mediocre. And given the tension of the US and USSR, the two nationalities working together, then not, now the new life is formed US and USSR forget about their problems. And, the problems are never explained. So, it's hard to accept any of it. So, to me this is a B rating for a B movie. Maybe B-, 6 stars. But given the acting, cinematography, and Fx, the pacing was slow but not boring, rating is a 7.I won't give a lower rating because it may ruin the first movie. They are different movies. Better to watch the two movies separately. Also, I would like to mention that compared to Alien, 2010 is a masterpiece. Alien has some of the worst acting, characters, dialogue, crap story with huge plot holes EVER. Alien is basically a prop movie. Prop of the alien, the detonation mechanism, etc. Worst part of Alien is the dirtbag characters, always squabbling and smoking. Smoking on a spaceship!

Roy Scheider's always fun to watch, here as a scientist thrust on a last minute mission to Jupiter on a state-of-the-art Russian spacecraft commanded my Helen Mirren (complete with sexy if unconvincing accent).John Lithgow and Bob Balaban add a lot of weight with their great supporting performances, and Keir Dullea (having barely aged at all in the 16 year interim) is back to reprise his role as Dave from the first film, adding a welcome feeling of continuity between two films with so little else in common.Well, they're both about monoliths, both about space, and both about contact with an extraterrestrial race but this film is much more a straight science fiction drama with a lot less existential and pretentious overtones for sure. Directed with the usual flair by Peter Hyams using his all-natural interior lighting similar to what made OUTLAND and CAPRICORN ONE feel so scungy. It's a neat look though it clashes with the absolutely gorgeous space shots highlighting some of the best special and visual effects ever seen, courtesy of Richard Edlund. Actually, the effects still hold up quite nicely and easily beat any CGI equivalents in terms of sheer impressiveness. The effects are easily the star of the show and beat out Koichi Kawakita's similarly impressive work on the Japanese-produced ""sister film"" SAYONARA JUPITER.So in following the theme of me reviewing each film in the year it's meant to depict, I'm looking forward to seeing the trend continue in the next Arthur C. Clarke adaptation.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

The story is much more straight-forward this time around, even though it tries to inject some spiritual mystery into it with the return of Dave Bowman. This mysticism is the highlight of the film, as it does a good job of echoing the original while furthering the story of the sequel. Unfortunately, the whole thing is bogged down by a ludicrous Cold War storyline that would be rendered obsolete only five years after the film's release. The effects are pretty impressive, especially at the end, and HAL is just as chillingly charming as in 2001, but Roy Scheider overacts terribly and the end is hopelessly cheesy.

It follows the book very well, right up to the fantastic ending that thrilled me beyond belief when I read it.

It is based on the excellent second novel in the series which began with the considerably weak ""2001"" (the book was weak; the movie was phenomenal). There were supposed to be two more parts to the story. The third, ""2061,"" would make a fantastic movie centering on Dr. Floyd and his sons. ""3001: The Final Odyssey"" has Frank Poole being found and revived. When will the series be completed? Anyway, ""2010"" was fantastic and impressive. While filled with Cold War paranoia that has been out of date since only six years after the movie was released, it also provided a hope-filled message in the guise of a terrific science fiction finale (SPOILER ALERT: Jupiter implodes into a star, which becomes known as Lucifer in the novels). Roy Scheider turned in a great performance as Dr. Heywood Floyd. Wouldn't it be nice if he got to continue the role that, in his entire career, is perhaps second only to his turn as Chief Brody in ""Jaws""?",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
58,kgprophet,Peter Hyams' best work as Director,6,9 September 2013,"Peter Hyams is a director that I both hate and love. He is a superb cinematographer, an OK director, but a horrible screenwriter. He tosses in one-liners or a smart-alecky type of delivery that is just plain annoying. Listen to the tone of the characters in his movies, they usually talk in harsh tones and seem relatively juvenile. He will write dialogue like ""This is the part where I'm supposed to do something, and not screw it up"". Frankly, it sounds like those lines were written because he could not think of anything more clever when confronted with a cliché piece of dialogue.Still I have enjoyed his efforts as a director. ""2010"" is a sequel to ""2001"" that explains all the mysteries leftover from the first film/book. Roy Scheider always gives a warm performance, and John Lithgow handles those one-liners very well. I found the story compelling, a joint US/USSR mission to Jupitor, and many of the notable aspects of the original movie are treated with respect. Since no plans or diagrams were saved from the original movie, it is also pretty remarkable how well the production accomplished this space adventure.""2010"" is Hyam's high mark as a director, it has decent pacing and flawless special effects. I enjoy the subplot about the instability of HAL, one of the main characters from ""2001"". The climax is also pretty spectacular. Although the movie predicts that there still a communist Russia in 2010, it is easy to forgive. The cold war aspects to the story can be appreciated for the tensions that existed at the time.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
59,buckikris,Two Countries Plus Teamwork Equals Answers,9,3 December 2014,"I watched 2010 the other night, the tension between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A..; in the 80's when this film came out. I am one of the few that actually liked both movies. The ending of 2001- A Space Odyssey left some wondering W.T.F.. I understood the ending, but it took me to viewings, but I got it. The movie 2010-The Year We Made Contact, although dated, I believe more people could relate too.In 2010, A team of Russian and American scientists are teamed up in space. During this period a war is brewing between the Soviets/Americans in Central America. Once Dr. Floyd, Roy Schneider, is briefed on the mission by Victor Milson, a N.S.A. Official. Dr. Floyd tells his family he is going on the mission. This doesn't sit well with his wife, but his son is very curious. Once on board The Leonov we see the team which is mostly Russian; and three Americans. They are Dr. Floyd, (Schneider), Dr. Curnow(John Lithgow); and Dr. Chandra( Bob Balaban). The mission is to find out why The Discovery Failed, explore the giant monolith; and the mystery of Dave Bowman. The team wakes up Floyd first, briefs him, and gives him the cold shoulder at first. Once the rest of the American team are awake they begin to work together; but the Russians lose one of their own when Tayna Kirberk(Helen Mirren) sends out one of the crew in a pod. She made the mistake of sending him close to explore the giant monolith.When Floyd, Chandra, and Curnow , board The Discovery they find out why the mission failed. Chandra turns to Floyd and says he is to blame; because he signed off on the mission papers. It isn't all is fault, but the government had conflicting reports; and a cover up is exposed. The mission was flawed from the beginning. It seems Poole and Bowman trained separately from the rest of the crew. If anything was to happen to the crew HAL was ordered to carry out the mission regardless; but got two different reports. HAL malfunctioned, became paranoid, killed the hibernating crew, along with Poole out in space. Bowman way able to disconnect him before he was the next target.When the war escalates, the crew aboard The Leonov must separate. When Floyd was back on The Discovery, he makes contact with Bowman. Bowman warns him they must leave because something wonderful will happen. He goes aboard The Leonov and tells Kirberk. They devise a plan to get home by using both the Discovery and Leonov. The Discovery will be destroyed, but before the destruction HAL sends a message on board The Leonov. In the meantime Jupiter is being swallowed by millions of these monoliths. The message is reveled on board, The Leonov leaves just in time; and a new sun is formed.In conclusion, I am more of a fan of 2010 than 2001. The reason because 2010 explains it all, it brings in what 2001 didn't. I consider 2001 a space opera; and 2010 more sci-fi/drama. Even though 2010 is dated due to the Cold War era, it's still a great movie",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

So, the usual disclaimers aside, its pretty good. Also, the Cold War is central here... there were Russians in 2001, but there is no indication the USSR still existed at all, kudos to Kubrick.Ha, well, ok, that's baggage, but it seems like there are far too few kids. The American contingent is mostly justified. The Americans seem to be easily into their 30s, at least, but so do the Soviets. The Americans MIGHT well accept older specialists, but why would the Russians? There's just no way.And also, the most glaring thing, is simply a very 80s Cold War Soviets are reckless and dumb and Americans are daring and smart. Yeah, it's all gung-ho and wonderful, but it's BS.

I'm genuinely struggling to find anything remotely good about this.The screenplay by Peter Hyams and Arthur C. Clarke is one of my least favourite things in general. The dialogue was so boring.

It's an enigma -- a space ballet with elements of thriller, mystery, mysticism, music and a whole lot of other things.On the other hand, ""2010"" is a pretty straightforward science fiction film, except for a few mysterious (but not exactly mystical) elements taken from 2001. The acting, visuals and story are all above average and don't deserve to be so overshadowed by 2001 (yet there's just no avoiding it, as it's billed as a sequel).Bottom line... if you can get over ""2001"" long enough to watch this, you'll likely notice a pretty good sci-fi film trying to get out.

65,rlaine,"Great movie, shouldn't be compared to 2001",9,5 May 2014,"This has for years been one of my go-to movies when I feel like I could detach from earth for a few hours. Kind of a guilty pleasure, altho there's nothing to be a shamed of really. This movie - while a bit dated - is a solid and an atmospheric experience from the beginning to the end.I liked 2001 also, I watch it maybe once every five years. 2010 I watch maybe every other year, so it does not hold any surprises, but I like the feel of it. While 2001 is somewhat heavy and artistic, 2010 is lighter and more accessible. Still, it's not a dumbed down Hollywood blockbuster, but rather quite an intelligent movie. In 2001 I still find different ways to interpret it, it holds time and renews itself, keeping a certain distance. 2010 is like your parents house, it never changes, you always feel like coming home.I didn't see 2010 in the theaters, I was around 10 when this came out, but I saw it later in the 80s as a rental. Back then it was a spectacular sci-fi movie. Now it has a certain nostalgia factor to it. If I now saw it for the first time, I'm not sure if it would stick with me as well as it does now.I've owned this on VHS, DVD and most recently on bluray. I have to admit I would rather probably watch it from VHS or DVD since bluray isn't very forgiving when it comes to fx shots. You can see a few times that the colors don't quite match. Despite of this I'd say the fx are pretty much on par with other sci-fi movies of that era. Most of them are flawless.All in all this was the time Hyams was on a roll. Outland is great movie and the sets here clearly utilize his experience gained with Outland. Altho not quite as industrial, but the lighting is dim and very atmospheric. Hyams is one of those directors that I'm waiting to make one more great movie. But like many of his contemporaries, he has fallen into a pit of low budgets and box office failures. Most notorious probably being the Sound of Thunder that looked very much unfinished.Acting is pretty good. Lithgow especially. Nothing spectacular, but solid show. The synth soundtrack is quite original.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
66,MovieGuy109,Okay sequel that is much too literal,5,5 November 2011,"2010-**-Not Good- Directed by: Peter Hyams, Written by: Peter Hyams, Arthur C. Clarke (Novel), Starring: Roy Scheider, John Lithgow, Helen Mirren, Bob Balaban, Keir Dullea, Madolyn Smith, Dana Eclar, Elya Baskin, Savely Kramarov, voice of Douglas Rain.Peter Hyams tries to match Stanley Kubrick's brilliance with his sequel to the 1968 masterpiece from the novel by Arthur C. Clarke. This time the story involves an astronaut mission nine years after the events of the first film back to the spacecraft lost near Jupiter. A new wave of discovery is soon to follow.The genius of Kubrick's original film was its avant-garde style. His refusal to dumb down his film to studio expectations and his use of brilliant symbolism throughout. This film has many positive things going for it such as the entertainment value and a hard to beat cast, but it lacks the figurative approach that made 2001 such an enlightening experience.Hyams takes everything literally and that diminishes the impact of the story. The ending is not even close to the ending of the first film. We do not think anything about this ending, it is just there and once we watch it, we are done with the process. There is no thinking process, we do not contemplate anything and thus, Hyams fails both his artistic subject matter and his homage to the original film.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
67,pkzeewiz,you've been drinking your whiskey from Kentucky,3,18 April 2010,"When a movie is good, it is almost always followed by a sequel. Some fool has to use the brilliance of the first to sponge off of and make money on. Here we see a movie that tries to take the beautiful original feel of the first film and follow it up with a science fiction copycat.The first film was full of interpretation this one is full of explanation...losing all of what made the original good.None the less the film wasn't awful, I rather enjoyed it, and just try to watch it as a stand alone movie and not a sequel.The creator of the original ship and original mission is approached by a Russian diplomat to go up with the Russians on a mission to look at the black monolith. David Bowman is considered dead and the ship is dormant. The Russians bring along the creator, an engineer and also the creator of HAL (the computer). Once in orbit they find the spaceship and start HAL over to see he has no recollection of the past. Bowman is no where to be found, but the monolith near Jupitor is still there.Events unfold and Bowmans ghost appears to tell them all to leave. Because of Russian and US battles on ground there is animosity on the ship as well, but ultimately they come together realizing they must get home. A new planet is overran by the aliens and it implodes making a new sun, the aliens via Bowmans ghost and HAL's message leave one message for mankind that basically says you can have the rest of the world but leave us alone.Okay so my explanation and synopsis was rather lame, but I do these reviews for myself to look at for future reference and don't care if anyone else likes them, I understand them so to hell with others.The direction was okay here but by 1984 space technology and film technology was a breeze to get on screen, the spaceships and planets are cool, but again it was easy to do, or at least easier than in Kubricks day. The same score was used , and all original music was nice but nothing that exploded and grabbed you. Acting was good and I had no problems with that. There were Russian actors and I was thinking that in the 80's and the turmoil between us and them really kept Russias popularity mainstream. Because of the problems we focused a lot on Russia actors and Russian themes in movies, perhaps we need a war with them to make them popular again lol...joke! For the most part this was a good story, it did have flaws and things that made me not like it. I didn't like the part where the spaceship ""airbreaked"" around Jupitor and was on fire, that made no sense to me, not the air-breaking, but the being on fire part. I did not like the using of David Bowmans character to speak to people on Earth, that was a stupid addition the plot.The movie is a good sci-fi drama, no action, no blood, no horror, just drama and at times a touch of suspense. Nothing close to its brilliant counterpart and not good and original enough to stand along the sides of Star Wars, Star Trek or any film like that. It was okay, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone without telling them to watch the first one, and then to tell them this one is nothing like that one - catch-22?. 3/10 stars.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

71,kingofdanerds,It's obviously not going to top the Kubrick classic,7,3 November 2020,"2010: The Year We Make Contact is the 1984 sequel to the Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unlike 2001, 2010 had its novel released before the movie was even thought of being made. Once again, Arthur C. Clarke wrote the novel but instead of having Kubrick direct the sequel, we have Peter Hyams who would later go on to direct movies such as TImecop and End of Days. 2010: The Year We Make Contact stars Roy Scheider (famous for Jaws and Jaws 2), John Lithgow (who I previously seen in Ricochet), and Helen Mirren. The film also sees the return Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain who previously appeared in 2001: A Space Odyssey. While having a bigger budget, 2010: The Year We Make Contact did do farily well at the box office but did not achieve the same praise and success that 2001 did.The film takes place nine years after the events of 2001 (obviously). Apprantly the orbit of the abandoned USS Discovery is decaying and everyone wants to know what exactly happened on board. Three Americans are put on board a Russian spaceship to go to the Discovery. On board, the Americans do not fully trust the Russians and the Russians do not fully trust the Americans. We this all being said, what will they all find out about the events that occured nine years before?First of all, this film is not going to be anywhere close to what 2001: A Space Odyssey did in any way, shape, or form. With that being said, 2010: The Year We Make Contact is an alright film. It could have very easily tried to imitate what Kubrick did with 2001, but instead is it's own thing in more ways than one. Before I get into the actual film itself, I will point out that the DVD I own of this film is in widescreen and has the biggest freaking black bars I have ever seen in any widescreen DVD. The black bars themselves must make up a little less than half of the screen!!! Anyways, the film does nicely continue the story that 2001 ended on. Sure, it was not really needed to have a sequel (in book or film) to 2001. Personally, the ending was mysterious and honestly, does anything need to be found out? Honestly it does not, but that is not to say that it could not be done. While this film does give us answers, some of them are not fully answered and are satisfyingly left mysterious. This film is not nearly as slow paced as 2001, but rather runs at a nice pace for the viewers to enjoy. Also, while I do highly recommend 2001, 2010 does catch people up and does explain (rather simply) about everything that happened in 2001. Everything about the story is pretty straightforward and should not confuse anybody. The acting is fairly good here and dare I say perhaps a little better than what we saw in the original. The characters are not half bad either. But one thing they do lack is character traits. The Russians character traits are literally that they are Russian. We get a little bit from the Americans but not a whole lot. But one can argue that the characters in 2001 had a lot either. (This is not the place to have such an argument). The way that I could describe this film is having the darkness of Alien, the effects of a really good Star Trek film, with a continuation of the story of 2001. When I mean this film has the darkness of Alien, I am talking about the film's lighting. Alien had dark lighting that was very effective for the film it was. 2010 is most definitely not a horror film but has that darkness. When you do happen to compare (though I prefer to view this film as it's own thing) this film and 2001, 2001 was a well lighted film. You could easily see everything from the planet surface, to the minature models that are the space ships. In this film, it is hard to see a whole lot of anything. I don't see this film as dark toned, so why is the lighting so dark? I also said that this film has the effects of a real good Star Trek film. Do remember that this film was released in 1984 and during that time Star Trek was on its third film already. The quality of it's effects are something that I would definitely see out of a Star Trek film. With that being said, yes, the effects are fairly good. Nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary. Just good. The themes here are basically togetherness. Mostly because we have Americans and Russians and it is the 80's so why not? It just does not pack as big as a punch as 2001 did. The ending or at least the last act of this film is pretty good and fun to watch and is even pretty suspenseful. Again, not nearly as good as 2001.With all of that being said, 2010: The Year We Make Contact is not going to top what 2001 did in anyway. But, that's the thing. It was not trying to be what 2001 was. To imitate it would have proven to be an even bigger failure. For some, 2001 was not their cup of tea (which is understandable). For those people, this may be their cup of tea. Even if you loved 2001, you might not like this film as much or you might just straight up hate it. Just view this film as it's own thing. Because, it truly is a fun film despite its flaws.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
72,David_Frames,"""My God, It's full of stars!"" Roy Schneider for one.",8,8 July 2005,"Apparently Kubrick fans like to refer to the Peter Hyams sequel as 'Ten Past Eight', their way of telling you that next to the original odyssey this is tepid stuff - run of the mill Hollywood fare, not the kind of film to define an era or act as a chaser to a cocktail of hallucinogenic drugs. The latter part is true but 2010 is a great deal more entertaining and whisper it quietly, human than its 'classic' predecessor. Hyams is no Kubrick and the difference between him and the old bastard is almost as great as the two films but he is an effective story teller and had, unlike the man he had to unenviable follow, excellent sci-fi credentials...well sci-fi credentials. His approach to the 2nd novel is not to try and replicate Kubrick's metaphysical bullshit - that'd be fatal, instead Hyams plan was simply to fashion a deep space adventure with enough intellectual weight not to embarrass anyone, least of all Arthur C.Clarke and he certainly achieves as much. Its very conventional stuff compared to 2001 but would it be like urinating in Holy water to suggest that its a damn sight more coherent, character focused and more satisfying as a result? Its undoubtedly Hyams most sophisticated effort, well-made and tightly directed. The anti-cold war message may have dated but you can re-fashion it to fit any ideological struggle you wish and the one world epilogue still convinces. I'm not saying 2010 is a work of genius but Hyams was a brave man to take on what is by common-consent a landmark movie and end up with something this good. If 2001 is about the insignificance of you and I in the grand scheme of things, after all Kubrick was fairly contemptuous of his own species, then heres a part 2 that readdresses the balance and puts people centre stage and whats wrong with that?

The acting is good and there is a continuation of the American/Russian relationship much like reality. The geopolitics of the 1980's was carried forward as if we'd still have a proxy war going on in Central America. There was a scene where the spacecraft used a fiber rope open to the elements of space as if it would hold but that was the worst of it. In this movie you come to understand how the AI Hal was able to defy orders in the first movie and you learn what happened to David Bowman. The most unrealistic part of the movie was that the real world fact that we stopped exploring space between the 1960s and early 1980s. We started launching satellites and created the space shuttle program but none of that moved humanity forward in its effort to better understand the universe we live in. Thankfully we are getting back on track with the Mars exploration and the iSS.

Dr. Floyd is the same character that we've seen on the station orbiting around earth and approaching the moon monolith.What this movie definitely is good for, it gives us the feeling people had of the cold war in that period, it's definitely more connected to earth political-fiction than the previous movie.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

I really didn't think that 2001 *could* have a sequel, being such an archetypal/fundamental story. But the way Arthur C. played it, it worked very well.Then this film came out and I couldn't convince anyone the book was any good anymore.Helen Mirren is the kiss of death for any film she touches - rather like Meg Ryan - and Roy Scheider belongs STRICTLY in action films: it's what he's for (I did like him in Naked Lunch, but he was basically playing himself).But the blame didn't rest on bad casting choices.It rested on EVERYTHING. The entire thing is just one giant bubbly mass of organs and feces.They left out major parts of the book that were more interesting than the parts they COULD have left out but didn't - then they changed, for the worse, what was kept.Bloody awful.

76,jrfranklin01,Hal? Again?,3,9 December 2004,"So here we are, 16 years later (9 years later according to the plot), trying to find out the meaning to Kubrick's/Clarke's earlier work, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Seems a bit late, don't you think? Despite the time (16 or 9), Roy Schneider heads things up as Dr. Floyd, the man responsible for the supposed fiasco of the Odyssey mission in 2001. It's funny though, Kubrick did the 2001 Odyssey in 1968, portraying things to possibly come some thirty-three years later. 2010's director, Peter Hyams, gives us the portrayal of the title twenty-six years into the future. Both were a gross overestimate (despite the 16-year span between films) of things to come on Arthur C. Clark's behalf.2010 does a good job though of picking up where 2001 left off. The U.S. is determined to discover what happened to the Odyssey mission. Unfortunately they do not have the spacecraft available to do so, but Russia does. Russia does not have the info. on the inner working of Odyssey, but the U.S. does. Hence, a joint U.S./Russia mission into space. This occurs while both countries are suffering poor relations that leave them on the brink of war (the later cause for war does not make sense). As to the monolith from the first film that gave the immortal ending of the baby in the embryo, well...now we have two monoliths.The Americans and Russians make their 2.5 year round trip expedition to one of the moons off Jupiter to board Odyssey. I had to a laugh when they got on board. To test the air, one of the Russians actually lifted up his faceshield and breathed in! There was some lame story about how their air meters got scrambled and couldn't function properly aboard Odyssey. Then the movie introduces a flaw. The Cosmonaut who lifted up his makes breathes in and while he is describing the smell of the air, he begins freaking out. He smells rotting meat which he assumes are rotting corpses. This just doesn't make sense. First, no more than a minute or two earlier we are told the air temperature is 100 below zero. With Odyssey being dormant for 9 years, its temperature would drop like a rock (even with it being sealed). How could anything rot?! I would think it'd be frozen. And the cosmonaut would smell little, if anything of decay. As to the reactivation of Hal, well that does put you a bit on pins and needles and a good job is done by the director at reinforcing this through Roy Schneider and John Lithgow (he sure is a crybaby in this film!). But I'll tell you not to expect much in the way of the homicidal Hal-9000 you saw in 2001. It appears that highly intelligent A.I. computer systems can be reasoned with are treated with respect and not as machines in this film. After what he did to the Odyssey crew, I treat him any way he wishes!Another tip, since Kubrick didn't direct, don't expect any of those long silences that seemed to give an odd emphasis that you just couldn't put your finger on. Hyam's work in 2010 is more rapid-paced and direct. As to the origin of the monoliths, 2010 gives no more explanation than 2001, other than to reaffirm the existence of some other life form. Good special effects (for the time), sets, and good acting are delivered, but 2010 gets a bit hokey in areas on a touch-and-go basis. The ending is especially melodramatic, with the impression that this film was intended to be an overglorified wrap-up and statement of the whole Arthur C. Clark series. In fact the whole movie is more story-oriented and less action orientation. There are only a few areas of real suspense with Schneider concluding with a diplomatic statement or address of universal peace (another ambitious sub-plot for the film). 4/10",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
77,chvylvr80,One of the greatest Sci Fi movies ever,8,10 October 2003,"The thing that bugs most people about this film is that it leaves too many things unanswered. There are too many things that are left up to the viewer to interpret. That is what makes 2010 such a great movie. That and the fact that it is a finely crafted piece of cinema. The acting is first rate by both American and Russian crews. The effects are well done and hold up in this age of CGI. The story moves slowly but that is to it's advantage since the first film unfolded even more languidly. It needs time to build the suspense and mystery. If it moved too quickly the movie would be over before any real suspense had built up. The film really asks you what happened. What is the monolith? What happened to David Bowman? What happened to Jupiter? These questions can only be answered by your interpretation of the movie. Bottom Line: If you like movies that make you think, 2001 and 2010 are two great movies for you. Even if you don't, they are still very well done and deserve to be seen if you haven't seen them yet.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

I certainly enjoyed the style of things and the use of music but was put off by the (as I thought then) great length and trumped up mysticism. Rather like ""Grand Prix"", and many sermons, it seemed a triumph of style over content. When 2010 came out, I missed it entirely. Years later I caught parts of it on television and was favourably impressed while,finally,today I saw the whole thing on DVD. I must be in the tiniest of minorities but I prefer 2010 to its overblown predecessor. (Recently I tried watching 2001 again but failed. Condemn me as a Philistine but 2001 has not stood the test of time.) Why, then, can I proclaim such an heretical opinion? First, 2010 is a film of hope. The detente, the second sun, the light symbolism, the redemption of HAL and his sacrifice, all these fit together as a satisfying and indeed touching story. Of course half the things mentioned in the movie no longer exist, from the CCCP to the airline but these things do not matter: hope persists. Second, the quality of the acting is inestimably above that of 2001. All, and I mean all, the actors are solid, believable, honest characters portrayed with a depth unseen in 2001. Schneider has never been better while Balaban is nothing less than superb. Hyams direction is both clear and touching.

82,fred-houpt,Makes 2001 an even greater masterpiece by comparison,3,7 March 2012,"I had forgotten that the director of 2010 was the same sad sack who directed one of the worst stink-bombs of all time ""Capricorn One"". Be that as it may, a director is allowed a few disasters in their career. When watching 2010 I could not help it but I had Kubrick's magnum opus playing side by side in my mind, minute by minute. This made for a painful watch because Hyams film sinks by as many degrees as Kubrick's rises. The contrasts could not be more obvious and any serious film buff should first see Kubrick's a few times and then see Hyams. With K. each single frame is meticulously thought out and from beginning to end the images force us to immerse in contemplation and poetry is everywhere. Each sound bite is crafted to highlight the drama without submerging it. The music is perfect in all moments. Hyams film suffers from early 80's schlock. The music sets ones nerves on edge, is awful, the editing is as subtle as a meat cleaver rendering flesh from the bone. The plot, well I don't know how close his script was to Clarke's novel and to be fair I would have to read it first. I understand that Hyams had to recreate all of the set pieces and they work fairly well on a special effects level. The overall pacing, dialogue, creation of tension and resolution are all rough edged, we see it coming almost half a light year away. Kubrick's is dream like and we do not anticipate where the dream is leading us. Hyams ham fisted attempt to deliver a sequel dies on the table and by 2012 standards is almost unwatchable. Here is a man who created special effects in 1984 that looked half baked, whereas Kubrick's 1968 is still unsurpassed to this day.

83,Jimmy-128,Read the book first,6,21 December 1999,"No, you don't have to read the book first to understand the plot of 2010. However, if you read it before seeing the film, you'll see how much the individual performances by Scheider, Lithgow, and Mirren make this movie as enjoyable as it is.Call me a purist, but too many things have been altered from the original for the sake of drama.  That's fine if it works; here, it doesn't.  There is a definite Eurocentric bent to the film; the Chinese, creators of some tense moments in the book, are absent here, and Dr. Chandra has somehow been transformed from an Indian living in the United States to an indistinguishable American.  The nationalistic tension between the characters of Heywood Floyd and Tanya Orlova seems forced and contrived.  In the book, they have a relationship based on mutual respect and genuine liking--not a sexual relationship, though, not with Tanya's husband on the ship with her, which is one of many details the movie omits.  Haywood's personal tribulations, including the difficulties in his own marriage, are likewise excised, as are any references to Curnow's bisexuality.The performances, however, are first-rate.  Helen Mirren in particular displays why she is one of the strongest and most underrated actresses in the industry today.  Watch her in her scenes after the pod disaster (which, again, doesn't take place in the book)--several actresses I could name would take the opportunity to emote to their heart's content.  Mirren doesn't.In short, the book is a much more complete package.

What I liked best is that it was very faithful to the book and makes Sci Fi into an art. Aurther C Clarke is so popular because he makes you see the beauty and wonder of what is out there, what is possible.2010, like 2001, is a great visualization of what Clarke is writing about.

87,Aditya_Gokhale,An ordinary sequel to an extraordinary film,6,12 May 2009,"""My God..it's full of stars!"" The film begins with this awful sounding recording...supposed to be Dave Bowman's last transmitted message before he ""disappeared"".Then there is the typical ""recap"" from the last movie..in the form of a report by Dr. Heywood Floyd, clearly depicting all that happened in Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is followed by the opening credits with a clearly altered version of the iconic ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" theme by Richard Strauss. Now, in that film, Bowman doesn't really say anything like ""My God..it's full of stars!"" We are not really supposed to know how he was feeling then, when he went through what he did.... but he does say these words in Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001..."" novel.Now if only they had been that faithful to Clarke's ""2010"" novel when making this film, it probably wouldn't have turned out like this. What we get is a very emotional and sentimental ""peace message"" in the guise of a Sci-fi film...and what's more..it is not just another Sci-fi film..it is a sequel to arguably the greatest Sci-Fi film of them all..In 2010, there is growing political tension between the US and the Soviet Union. In such an environment, a joint American-Soviet expeditions is sent towards Jupiter to investigate what went wrong with the Discovery, to try and reactivate HAL 9000 and find out why he malfunctioned and to find out the overall meaning of Bowman's last words!""2010"" refrains from using anything and everything that made ""2001..."" a GREAT film. Some of that film's many qualities are the minimal use of dialog, the emphasis on soundtrack, fantastic visuals and the sheer enigma of it all...While making this sequel, however, director Peter Hyams throws all those aspects out the window and what we get is a proper ""talkie"" ordinary sci-fi ""thriller"" with the whole story explained from time to time in the form of Dr. Floyd's voice-over, some terrible dialog and some comic scenes (Sample this: Curnow: ""No sh*t?"" Floyd: ""No sh*t!""). The effects look dated compared to the original which came out around 16 years before this! There was a reason why Kubrick ordered his sets of ""2001.."" destroyed! Also thrown in are some ""tense"" scenes very common to such kinds of ""expedition"" films, which I will leave unmentioned here.The film heavily relies on the acting as well..Dr. Floyd's role is played by Roy Scheider and he does a great job. Helen Mirren is great too, as Tanya Kirbuk. Keir Dullea reprises his role as Dave Bowman for a couple of scenes. Douglas Rain lends his voice again for Hal 9000. Then there are others like Bob Balaban and John Lithgow who are fine, really, but then the film itself doesn't make for the kind of magical experience that the original was.That said, this is not an entirely bad film. As a stand-alone, it is a decent film and does have its moments that make for a good one-time watch. But that's about it...nothing earth-shattering.

88,benjamin_lappin,The Unexplored Does Not Always Need Explaining,4,11 December 2007,"Any comparison this film receives to its predecessor should be deemed as blasphemy, this film isn't even in the same universe yet alone same ball park as the grandiose piece of cinema Kubrick lavishly constructed, however, there is something deeply and severely annoying which makes this film rather intriguing. Fans, lovers, or indeed those, like myself that would score 2001: A Space Odyssey with an unashamed ten out of ten and even profess it to be a contender for the greatest film of all time should approach this film with scepticism, but when you figure out what the director has tried to do, the over all film becomes more like a case study, I shall try and explain further.2010 can only, and I repeat only, work on one level, and that is to completely forgo 2001 for everything that it meant. 2001 was an epic study in human development, evolution, mans potential and what it is that makes us what we are, HAL for example is not just the dangers we could face with trying to create artificial intelligence, he's also the mirror image of ourselves. For 2010 to work, and this is the hardest part for any adorer of the original, you must put aside the thoughts of philosophy and meta-physics, treat 2001 not as the grand arty thought provoking film it is, you must 'simply' take out the eventful goings on. If you do that, if you take the events in 2001 as not a director at his prime talking to an audience but as an actual occurrence in a ""reality"", 2010 works. And when I say works, I mean, it's watchable. The Day We Made Contact is kind of a double edged title because it says what happens but in a sense destroys the mystique, and that's the film all over really. The director has studied Kubricks 2001 and uses similar techniques, his compositional work is severely similar, and he too has a penchant for slow cinematic movements, filling the screen with the grandiose, but everything else is as far removed as can be. Gone is the sparse dialogue, and in its stead we have rudimentary dialogue which at my cruelest reads like an episode of Star Trek. The philosophy within has changed. No longer is it about humanities potential to grow, to evolve for we have seen that already, now the focus is turned to creationism, to the beginning of life, and through it that mystique surrounding the monoliths whilst perhaps poignantly crafted in places, is gone, it's the Arthur C Clarke equivalent to Lucas' dispelling the mythology of the force and placing it all on bacteria. While there is a certain merit to everything that goes on, and it's done with the director and actors moving around on tip toes as to avoid upsetting the original, the feel of the film is wrong due to the way it sets itself up. What sums this up more than anything I suppose is the justifications, or at least the reasonings, behinds HALs malfunction. They take the idea that he is in fact humanised and even go as far to all but call him a human. But then if you've seen and followed the first one, we already knew that, turning him into a humble hero because he's ""treated with respect"", doesn't quite wash over, and furthers the clichéd and to a saddening extent cheesy sci-fi notions pumped through.There are moments throughout, Roy Scheider makes a thoroughly convincing attempt to be the Dr Lloyd we had already seen, but the dialogue he has to deal with does not permit for accolades. It's most definitely an attempted sequel, it blazes out Strauss' On The Beautiful Blue Danube in its opening title sequence to truly hammer home its point, it is a sequel and it demands to be taken seriously, and it has enough to be treated as a scientific ""what would people actually do if these events took place and were investigated"" case study, but it's not a film. There are no moments of awe inspiring wonder, although the seeing of the final monolith on Lucifer, and the dual sun shots are quite something, it never captures that vital awe, and to an extent that comes highly from its attempts, unwittingly or not, to dispel by explanation the originals iconic and mythical status. 2010 provides severe intrigue for even those that view 2001 as something untouchable, it furthers the continuation of a world where these events happened and makes a ""story"" out of it and above all that is interesting, the trouble is it just isn't a good film as a stand alone, which is why it warrants the score attributed. There are some unexplored truths that never need explaining and this is no exception, but you cannot take away the intrigue and interest the film brings, unless you view it as blasphemy of course.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

91,Raptorclaw155,A Surprising Followup,6,19 April 2020,"I don't think many would have ever expected for there to have been a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 2001. Having seen 2001 I was a little apprehensive about what the approach to this film was. After all, nobody talks about this one at all, let alone in comparison to 2001.2010 feels a lot more like a 'diet' Kubrick film- that is to say that there are some cinematic stylings similar to Kubrick as far as the imagery is concerned, but at the end of the day it is a much more conventional film. This film contains a lot more dialogue than 2001 and much of that dialogue is used to explain, in detail, everything that is going on in the film, since 2001 was very open-ended. My favorite scenes in the film are when they are looking for the USS Discovery and, later, the Monolith.That said, the film has a few issues that I felt were half-baked or completely unnecessary. The scenes with Bowman's mother, I felt, could have been cut out of the film entirely with little to no effect on the film itself. The growing conflict between the US and Russia while Americans and Russians are out trying to figure out the issue of the Monolith, HAL, and the USS Discovery was probably the most half-baked part of the story. The conflict between the two countries seemingly escalated out of nowhere and the film's emphasizing the two different nationalities of astronauts putting the conflict at home aside to work together seemed completely unearned. And what happens at the end being able to end the US-Russian conflict on Earth peacefully was difficult to believe.The best scenes in the film, in my opinion, are the interactions between HAL and the character who programmed him. There's an argument to be made about HAL's redemption in this film to be a bit cheesy, but that was one weird thing the film did that I actually could get behind. I liked HAL as a character in 2001, and he's carried over into 2010 very nicely.2010 is quite the oddity. Drawing comparisons between itself and 2001 is useless because 2001 is a film that can't be expected to have a followup that can be as good as or better than itself. 2010, luckily, is a little bit like 2001,but at least- while it does sometimes feel like a diet Kubrick film, doesn't feel like a cheap imitation. 2010 is it's own film and it wears that on its sleeve and that is the most respectable aspect of the film. I still think it's worth giving a watch if one is curious of what a Kubrick film might have looked like if appropriated by 1980s Hollywood- which sounds like a disaster waiting to happen but... well, the fact that it isn't makes this a surprising followup.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

What amazes me is that A C Clarke, the creator of the original story, was behind this thing and wrote the book that gave birth to this movie. Now, if you have not watched (or read) 2001 a Space Odyssey, this might still work for you as an OK film. As a matter of fact, in most synopsis, 2010 is defined as the sequel to 2001; the simple reality is that there was not and there will never be a logical possibility to give 2001 a sequel. It is simply wrong, a huge mistake. 2001 is the epic of mankind from its very beginning to its future. The first ""man"" (actually, an ape) was selected by an external intelligence 4 millions of years ago to lead the specie from an animal level to a human one. The very same intelligence selects now another man to transition humankind as we know it to its next level - as we don't yet know it. Then instead what happens in this book? Only 9 years later, in2010, we discover that nothing has changed, good old earth is still the same good old thing, good old mankind is still hanging there as it was 9 years before... So what? The phenomenal cosmic fetus floating in the space at the end of 2001, the cathartic promise of the next step of humankind was a joke? Was it an hallucination?

Clarke makes sure that we are given a much more tangible message -- yet it is so dated.  Couldn't he have made a more timeless message?   Did Clarke honestly think the cold war would last 20 or so years?Roy Scheider's Floyd narrates an epilogue speculating that maybe people aren't meant to understand the cabalistic monolith.  Does Clarke mean to say that the first film can't be understood?  So, he offers Cliff Notes for comprehension of the plotline.  But this is a very very very different film than 2001:  A Space Odessey and more like Red Dawn or War Games.The message:  The Soviet Union and the US need to work together.  
Then again, maybe that doesn't truly explain the first movie at all!",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

I know it because a comb appeared in midair and some old bat died with a smile on her face.Why would a superior intelligence make its intentions all secretive? I think most humans could follow what a track to a better life might be and imagine how misery might be eliminated. I am not so sure I want to be transformed into some ooey gooey touchy feelie sugary blob of energy. I kind of like all my moods not just the joyous brotherhood ones.What has always bothered me a bit about the whole ""thesis"" of the Odessey (2001, 2010 ad nausea...) sequence is why a superior intelligence would have let the last few million years happen. This superior intelligence appeared and decided apes should be the chosen species and showed them how to kill some poor hyena with a rock. Then the next few million years passed filled with endless violence misery pain and disease and suddenly oppps we are ready to move on...this time to some sugary Christian hell (oppps heaven).Arthur C. Clarke was a fairly good science fiction writer in the 50s. Not nearly as imaginative (nor intelligent) as someone like Larry Niven but decent. His characters were about as deep and forced as cut out paper dolls, but that isn't what you read his books for it was for the scientific possibilities of the near future. Some where along the line he sold his name and started to ""coauthor"" works with various people including someone with the unlikely name of Elmer Gentry etc etc.... After that every imaginable piece of garbage was then produced or coauthored ""by Arthur C. Clarke""....try reading some of the later Rama Series if you don't believe me.

99,arminhage,Good entertainment but lacks any scientific nor artistic value,3,27 December 2014,"Despite the common belief, this movie has no answer to unanswered questions of the 2001 nor it helps the audience to better understand the original movie. This a cheap flick, an attempt to make some money on the success of the 2001. I would say it is something like Terminator 3 or 4, cheap movies based on awesomeness of the originals however it was good entertainment on it's own. Plays were cheesy, Roy Scheider appears as ""NAGGING MR ALWAYS RIGHT"" which why I despise him because he had absolutely no talent, playing 100 movies and he has the same character in all of them! The opening scene is probably the most ridiculous when Dr Moisevitch approaches Floyd (Scheider) on the telescope. There is no way that someone could hear Moisevitch's voice while standing on top of the giant telescope! Seriously, how a director or screen writer can make such an obvious mistake? Movie is too noisy, inside spaceships are too dark as of most sci-fi of the period and instead of having an imitation of futuristic electronics, there are monitor screens straight from mid 80s but probably the ending was what made me go ballistic! A new sun was created in the solar system! Sounds cool except that in reality, such phenomena would cause the earth to be over heated and almost all life on planet earth would be destroyed! I'm a great fan of Sci-Fi and I hate open ended movies in which the ending would be left open to be guessed by the audience but what I hate more is cheesy and obviously unscientific answers. I believe an open ended is far better than a sham like this. If you watch this movie as a sequel to the 2001, you'll despise it immediately but if you try to forget about the 2001 and what it as a stand alone sci-fi, there is some entertainment value in it.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

Apalling missed opportunity.,3,22 September 2020,"Anybody who cares to review my reviews for IMDB will see how I exult in great films but this is the only one, so far, to which I give such a low rating.A missed opportunity of a glorious sequel!Previously, in '2001', a genius of a director is paired with a genius of a science fiction writer and they produce one of the greatest science fiction films which was ever made or perhaps ever will be made, even allowing for the unimaginable film technology of the future.In '2010', a genius science fiction writer is paired with a not so great film director and a mediocre film results. And my science fiction/artistic heart bleeds!I think there is a moral here, somewhere, about how to create magic or mediocrity in films.I wonder what went wrong? Was it budgetary or time constraints or could a more appropriate director in the pairing have come somewhere close to equalling the original?The only reason I gave this film three stars is that the special effects are pretty good. I like the space ships and interiors.Also, while Roy Schneider gives a great performance as Doctor Floyd he is Roy Schneider and still not the William Sylvester of the original. Helen Mirren is brilliant as the Russian lady cosmonaut but then she has a genuine Russian heritage upon which she drew and when was she poor in any film in which she appeared? Jon Lithgow is apparently auditioning for the artistic subtlety he subsequently brings to the tv comedy series 'Third Rock from the Sun' (which actually I love!).Perhaps the producers thought they could produce a decent sequel cheaper? Well, you never can for a great, great film.

101,RandomTask-AP,"It's not so much an ""Odyssey"" as it is a tribute.",8,28 March 2004,"(Some Spoilers.)        Science fiction once again, provides filmmakers with the opportunity to explore an historic issue in the microcosm of an unusual setting. While the questions of humanity's origins and destiny were raised in `2001: A Space Odyssey', Peter Hyams' sequel, `2010: The Year We Make Contact', is more concerned with the future direction of the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. In delivering its message, the dark lighting gives the film a stark appearance with a very direct camera style, which gives a realistic feel to the events that take place in orbit of Jupiter.          From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the Cold War is at issue, however, the film takes a larger look at the issues of trust, overcoming biases, and facing the frightening unknowns in life. When Dr. Floyd tells his wife of his plans to join the Jupiter mission, it requires a leap of faith for her to believe he will do everything he can to return to her safely just as he must believe that she will continue to care for him after he makes such a devastating choice. Not only must the biases between Soviet and American be reconciled for the mission to succeed, but the suspicions of man and machine are also faced in the depths of space. Various new challenges in the unknown face the recovery crew: encountering a threatening new form of life, breaking across the top of Jupiter's atmosphere, disobeying direct orders, and trusting their lives to the ""ghost"" of a man presumed nine years dead. The cast is working with a script that requires them to mostly deal with the current situation. However, this works with the point of the film in reference to the Cold War because if the two nations fail to deal with their set of circumstances, the situation of tension will overwhelm both and lead them to their ends. Only when the characters face the challenges with their own ingenuity and determination do they exceed their limits and cross into new understandings.         At its release in 1968, `2001' exceeded every expectation and precedent for special effects photography in a space adventure, and `2010' supports its story with comparable effects and solid photography. In a behind-the-scenes featurette, `2010: The Odyssey Continues' (1984), a member of the production crew stated that all the original models and designs from `2001' were destroyed when the film was finished in order to prevent anyone from copying the styles into other films. Meticulous attention to detail in the recreations is apparent when the crews board The Discovery in its orbit of Jupiter's moons. Hyams never restricts the camera, thus allowing the audience get a full look at the interior. One scene with anti-gravity effects has Dr. Floyd, who is magnetically grounded to the floor, demonstrating a launch maneuver with two floating pens. The absence of gravity is displayed seamlessly in many scenes, which is more impressive because the film pre-dates the use of computer-generated effects that are now capable of creating any illusion on film.          As a director, Hyams's plain storytelling style has had many  mixed results, but `2010' succeeds greatly. Here he generally uses the camera to tell the story directly and objectively, but it works in keeping the focus on the characters and the story. This sequel is clearly not on the same philosophical level with the original, but it honors Kubrick's work by respectfully following the dance steps of characters slowly moving forward through the challenges of a mysterious universe. In cinematography alone, 2010 is a worthy sequel as it creates an echo of a beloved film.8 out of 10",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

It's greatest legacy is that it demonstrated that bug-eyed monsters and blasters are not the limit of sci-fi on celluloid and that there is indeed another road to go down.2010 (the film...) is a more mainstream effort certainly, in places predictable but it is a whole log better than the devotees of the great god Kubrick would have you believe. In 2010, a lot of things are changed from the book (This I do not like, and would prefer studios to leave-as-is ) and the movie is not as good as it could have been.However, it's still a good film with a decent (if modified) script and some very, very good acting mostly from Helen Mirren, Oleg Rudnik and Saveli Kramarov.Perhaps it tries to supply too many of the answers to the questions raised by the first, but it is good enough (and should?) stand on its own merits.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
103,Oblomov_81,Concrete and Lifeless,5,3 February 2003,"Peter Hyams' ""2010"" suffers from the need to give solid answers to questions for which only a fool would want a flat explanation. Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" respected the viewers' intelligence and left all interpretation up to them. The most fascinating works of art are the ones that inspire intense conversation and debate, and to this day people are still arguing about what ""2001"" meant and what can be deduced from it. After watching ""2010,"" however, there is not much to discuss. All the answers have been provided, and they are simplistic explanations that reduce the complexities of the original film to meager Hollywood plot devices. The worst example is how HAL is made out to be a victim and is eventually redeemed into a hero, a pathetic betrayal of one of the screen's most mysterious antagonists.As for the whole conflict between the Americans and the Soviets in the film, it did not add any interesting dimension to the plot. It came off more as a product of the cold war era rather than something that could be read into years later. ""2001"" still shines bright after three and a half decades, but ""2010"" is a generic, concrete, and ultimately forgettable. If you want to see a much more interesting science-fiction interpretation of a classic, try watching Hyams' ""Outland,"" which is a creative take on Zinnemann's ""High Noon.""",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
104,michaeldouglas1,2010: A Space Nullity,4,6 August 2011,"Tough to even compare this ""sequel"" to 2001, as it's simply a whole different type of movie. Whereas 2001 was a surreal fantasy, who's enduring charm was it's mystery, 2010 is simply another action-adventure film. 2001 was the very definition of ""grandeur"" in filmmaking, in scope & breadth of story, taking the audience thru man's evolution from ape to ""modern man"" & beyond. By contrast, seeing 2010 is more like scanning the newspaper, very pedestrian & ""safe"". While 2001 still largely seems fresh and ""timeless"", 2010, made 16 years later, looks more dated and less relevant. Worse, 2010 is simply far too literal for it's own good. It plays like a space age ""Dragnet"", pouring out all the facts, trying to answer (believable or not) the questions of it's predecessor. By the end everything is neatly wrapped up in a nice package... which makes 2010 about as sterile as a NASA clean room. Of course 2010 is horribly dated now, with the USSR and Cold War references. But more to the point, it seemed dated even when it came out in 1984! This was set in the future, and judging from the (thankfully) few topical allusions in 2001, the Cold War was long over, replaced by cooperation. Yet in 2010 we get a running subplot about another Cuban missile crisis threatening to bring on World War III, and stereotypical mistrust between Russian and American crewmembers? At the time I recall thinking how out of step this was with the whole concept of 2001. The world crisis of 2010 would have been at home in the 1960's, but not by the 80's era of détente. Odd that in 2010 we're actually thrust back into Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" territory -- something I doubt Kubrick himself would have done if he'd been involved in this project. Next, there's an over-abundance of information bombarding the audience throughout 2010... almost like Hyams felt his audience was too stupid to figure anything out for themselves. So we're given a running monologue of events by Dr Floyd, which is monotonous to the point of annoyance. The plot device used are recorded ""letters"" home to his wife and son (wonder if they found them as tedious as the audience?). This whole thing comes off as a bore, and a cheat -- a truly good screenwriter can convey necessary technical info without having to read it off cue-cards to the audience. Then we get long-winded messages from earth, giving us details of the unraveling world situation... always ending with some homily like ""Just hope there's an earth left for you to return to..."" YAWN. Sorry, but I found Dr Chandra's ""explanation"" for HAL's murderous behavior far-fetched, like he was really ""reaching"" to excuse away the psychotic HAL's actions with double-talk. Having Chandra overprotective of his surrogate ""child"" HAL might, I suppose, have made a mildly interesting subplot, had Hyams cared to explore it. And Chandra's blaming the government's lying for HAL's malfunction was not only very self-serving (casting blame away from him, as HAL's creator) but also a bit too ""standard"" and convenient in the post-Watergate era. Hardly original, to say nothing of believable. What, merely ordering HAL not to reveal the purpose of the mission until they reached Jupiter's orbit would send this super-sophisticated computer into a tailspin of mistakes and miscalculations, culminating in murder? (If Chandra had grafted his own ""personality"" into his ""child"" HAL, as the movie suggests, then one must really wonder too about Chandra's mental state). Evidently the death of five people (Poole & the 4 hibernating scientists) didn't much trouble Chandra as he gave the all-too-standard rant against govt ""duplicity"". Whereas 2001 was very spare on dialog, and therefore didn't come off as too ""pedestrian"", in this movie we get altogether too much talk. Not only Floyd's droning on and on in his ""letters"", but folksy reminiscences about baseball & hot dogs, Kentucky, and his son getting together with a woman cosmonaut's daughter -- IF there's a world left for them... yeah, right (zzzzzzz). Vapid and out of place. Even worse is the running gag of Chernow's Russian buddy getting American sayings all mixed up... ""easy as cake"" (ha ha ha) ""piece of pie"" (ho ho ho). Hyams falls back on the Hollywood tradition of throwing in ""comic relief""; yet ultimately it cheapens the movie. Can anyone imagine Kubrick including such junk in 2001? Kubrick not only disdained comic touches, but went to pains to show that Bowman & Poole had reached the point, during the 18 month mission, where they barely even talked to each other. Compared to them, HAL was a chatterbox. There was no cloying sentimentality in 2001; in fact Kubrick actually satirized such muck when he showed Poole's birthday message from his folks, and Poole's blasé reaction to it.2001 actually benefited from the ensemble cast of character-type actors. William Sylvester (Dr. Floyd) & Robert Beatty were little-known outside of England. Keir Dullea & Gary Lockwood were journeyman actors who had not really ""made it"" by that time (nor would they ever achieve stardom) so they appear fresh. In contrast, everybody's seen Roy Scheider & John Lithgow in too much movies and TV, so it's hard to take them as seriously in these roles.Can't blame Kubrick for ""steering clear"" of this mess! Trying to top 2001 would have been difficult under any circumstances; this tepid script certainly wasn't gonna do it. And, to date, no one's filmed Arthur C. Clarke's third book of the ""2001 Trilogy"": 2061. I can only assume that the public reaction to this film (to say nothing of 2001 aficionados, Kubrick devotees, and sci-fi fans) doomed any such project. Whether you liked or disliked 2001, you certainly couldn't ignore it. It was big, it was different, it was an ""Event""! Sadly, 2010 was just another run-of-the mill action movie, a couple hours of mild distraction, then quickly forgotten.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
105,mig28lx,Genuinely entertaining and slick,8,12 September 2000,"Sure, the cold-war subplot is laughably dated.  Sure, the ending is typical Hollywood schlock, rewriting the book for the purpose of making it happy instead of just hopeful.  But, doggone it, this movie is just plain good, slick filmmaking.  The FX are fantastic.  The script is clear and concise. The actors are completely believable, especially Lithgow as the acrophobic astronaut - not exactly the occupation he should have, given his phobia.Regarding the inevitable comparisons to ""2001"" -- well, I suppose ""2010"" doesn't leave as much to the viewer's imagination as its predecessor. Blame not the moviemakers, faithful viewer.  Rather, blame the attention-span of the average, or even below-average, moviegoer.  I include myself in the ranks of moviegoers bombarded with movies that rely more on star power and quick, slick images than on intellectually meaty material and deep questions.  Accounting ledgers will show that studios nowadays (and back when ""2010"" was made) profit more from short, sharp punches than from long, meandering expositions on man's place in the universe.  Hollywood's fault? The public's fault?  Perhaps the blame lies in both places, but we are more ready to criticize corporate America because they have virtually no forum where they can respond to our accusations.  (Our version of screaming obscenities to the crocodiles only after safely crossing the stream.)That aside, let me say I thoroughly enjoyed this film, regardless of how great ""2001"" is.  Fans of sci-fi will enjoy the concepts and execution of some of the concepts, especially the tantalizing possibility of organic life on Europa, which has been debated for ages.

The elegance and genius of 2001's nearly dialogue-free script lets one ponder the stunning visuals and haunting score thoughtfully, and on the viewer's own terms; filtering through his or her own life experiences and beliefs. In 2001 HAL was left as a menacing, vengeful nemesis and should have stayed as such. His transformation in ""2010"" into a caring, thoughtful ""soul"" is insulting. Saccharine sweetness.

107,MatBrewster,Why? Why?,2,2 March 2005,"I watched 2001 for the first time in college. I had no intention of seeing the sequel because I knew it was not made by Kubrick and felt it would probably be very inferior. However, my roommate, decided to rent it and I watched it. Even though my parents gave it to me a couple of years ago, I have had no desire to actually watch it. But since I have vowed to review all the movies in my collection I did my duty this evening. I was mildly surprised, but not at all impressed.In watching this movie I did my best to remove the idea that this is a sequel out of my head and just tried to enjoy it as a science fiction film. This was increasingly difficult since a great deal of time in this film is spent going back and explaining all of the events in 2001. This is probably my greatest complaint about the film. Where 2001 works not by not giving any answer, 2010 works too hard to give meaning not only to itself, but also 2001. Where 2001 is silent, allowing images to tell the story, 2010 fills nearly every moment with noise.The visuals of 2010 were very well done. I felt the images of the space ships, planets, and space travel were quite nice. The special effects, in general, were also very nice. The film does get severely dated with it's cold war subplot. Americans and Russians working together in space while their political counterparts wage war on the Earth below may have been effective at the time, but today it only seems cheesy.I have not read the books to 2001 or 2010 so I do not know if their explanation of HAL's ""malfunction"" are the same as the movies. I can't help but feel disappointed with the explanation either way. I have always felt that part of the power of 2001 was how it didn't answer many of the questions it asked. How there was no explanation of where the monoliths came from, no explanation of what went wrong with HAL, no explanation of what the long sequence at the end meant. It's as if by not giving us explanations, the viewer has to fill in the gaps. In 2010 we get more answers than we need. Any real explanation of why HAL went bad, no matter how logical, seems to dull the experience of watching 2001. Now again, I haven't read the books, where I believe those very things are explained. So those who have read the books may not feel the same way, but this is my experience.In the end, that is the better way to sum up my feelings on this movie. If you have never read the books, but find 2001 to be an immensely satisfying film experience then 2010 is most likely to be disappointing. However, if you have read the books and have already had much of the meaning behind 2001 explained to you, then you may find more enjoyment out of the sequel. Likewise, if you have never seen the art that is 2001, or found it too heady to understand, then 2010 may be an enjoyable piece of science fiction.Like this review?

The special effects are quite good, especially the visuals of the planets and moons and also of the two spacecraft.  The scenes where the spacecraft is slowing down in the moon's atmosphere is really well done and seems very plausible  based on what we know about space craft entering into the atmospheres around planets.

There are things in the universe much larger than the petty differences that divide us. A wake up call for humanity to stop fighting and play nice.PROS AND CONS First of all, you can't talk about this film without discussing the film that came before it. Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a landmark in cinema. It redefined the concept of science fiction and pushed the envelope of film making way past its limits. In that regard, this film does not measure up. It cant, but it is a worthy effort.I always heard that you had to read the book to really understand ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". After seeing it 4 or 5 times, I finally read the book and they were right. What I thought I knew about the first film finally came into sharp focus after reading Arthur C. Clarke's book. Clarke went on to write several follow up books to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". This film is based on one of those books.This film is a bit dated because, like the original, the future didn't turn out the way we thought it would. As the film opens, the Soviet Union and the United States are on the brink of war. Something that never happened with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 90s. I recall being disappointed when Pan-American Airlines went out of business, because one of my dreams of seeing a real space liner with the Pan-Am logo from the first film was never going to be realized. Such was the power of the vision that Kubrick gave us with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".The premise of this film is logical. We go back to figure out what happened to Astronaut Bowman and the HAL-9000, not to mention figuring out what the huge monolith was. The story telling and the visuals are all up to par in this film, although the film is a bit more formulaic as opposed to the stark and calculating story telling of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".In the end, the astronauts get to witness the act of cosmic reproduction on a planetary scale and in so doing, learn that we are very small in relation to the big picture. So small in fact, that they understand we are just parasites in a vast living universe.

If you spend the entire film drawing comparisons, you will be soundly disappointed as many people were in 1985 upon its release.The movies simply have different purposes. 2001 is a work of art that attempts to elicit an emotional response to abstract concepts. Kubrick intentionally leaves questions unanswered so we can decide for ourselves what the answers are or if they even exist. 2010 is an adventure story that lays out the plot details of its predecessor probably in a way similar to what Arthur C. Clark would have envisioned for a film adaptation of 2010: Odyssey Two. 2001 was based on Clark's short story (the Sentinel) but the artistic beauty of the film comes completely from Kubrick. 2010 is more a of straightforward, nail on the head adaptation of the novel.All that being said, 2010 is not a bad movie by any means. It is certainly much more accessible than the prequel and Peter Hyams does a good job reproducing the awe that should be affiliated with a good space opera. Roy Scheider is clearly trying his best to put on a good performance but I personally think he was the wrong casting choice. The acting in general is unremarkable.The best part of the movie has to be the finale of the last 10 minutes. This is really when the sense of wonder begins to pick up again after a few hours of straightforward, linear plot progression. However, unlike 2001, the open ended questions asked are not as philosophical as they are plot related. Most are clearly answered and explained in 2061: Odyssey Three (which, by the way, is worth a read as is Clark's entire series).If the fact that I've been referencing 2001 throughout this review despite saying we should put it out of our minds in the first sentence wasn't indication enough, I will go ahead and reiterate that 2010 is not in the same league as its predecessor. There can be only one 2001, but that doesn't prevent 2010 from being a noteworthy installment in the body of science fiction. It is a must see for anyone interested in the genre but as to whether or not it qualifies as one of the ""greats""... I'll leave that for you to decide.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

In the end you have beauty film, which is as empty bottle.Absolutely same as in the 2001 I'm feeling single one strong story, and it's the one with HAL 9000 at the end.It's normal to film this ""empty"" films, i don't think so...",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
114,gpaltrow2001,"Surprisingly polarizing, but doesn't hold up well.",7,29 August 2007,"I read both books, and saw both movies, when they first came out. I have recently re-watched both films. I have enjoyed reading the wide-ranging ratings of viewers of 2010. I can't think of another film on IMDb.com that has so many saying it's terrible on one side, and so many saying it's great on the other. Hardly anyone is neutral, and the votes truly seem split. That kind of stuff is actually good for cinemaphiles, I believe. How many reviews saying how great 'Citizen Kane' is do we need? In any case, it should make more folks want to watch or re-watch both, and that's good. 2010 is frustrating because it wants to be a polished, intelligent follow-up to 2001, yet in today's spoiled climate of jaded moviegoers it sometimes misses the mark for today's expectations. It is well-acted in some scenes, and poorly acted in others. It is thrilling in some scenes, flat in others. The special effects seem dated sometimes, and really good other times. Had I written this in 1984, I would have given it a higher rating for sure. Today, side-by-side, 2001 is better as a visual, intellectual exercise, and 2010 is better as a straight-forward, above-average, more literal and modern sci-fi film. Yet it is for that exact reason 2001 will always be considered superior. Having said that, for fans of good cinema, and intelligent science fiction, a watching of both films in correct order is a must. Together they will make you think about your tiny place in the universe.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
115,cdimdb,SF for children,1,15 August 2005,"Should a helpful genie ever grant me a wish to have just one film obliterated forever from history and the memory of humankind, you may be sure that this appalling heap will be the one. '2010' serves as proof of whose movie '2001' was, because '2010' is definitely Clarke's, and it's a wretched thing indeed. Bad enough by itself, but a foul and shameful creation to seek to place itself alongside its predecessor.Now, Arthur C. deserves his title as one of SF's Great Men. In his heyday he knocked out some very fine SF, based on some brilliant extrapolative ideas. Nor were they just SF plots: this is the man who invented communications satellites, for instance.Good SF concepts, but mediocre execution. He's a Big Ideas man, and he doesn't fuss much with subtle plot-twists to get them across. If there's are no convenient pair of characters around to tell each other - and us - then he'll write lots of Dear Angela letters, and tell everything to her - and us.So it is with this film: a series of set pieces to show off Clarke's clever notions: aerobraking, Europa's subsurface ocean, Io's vulcanism and rebooting HAL - interspersed with Dear Maggie VOs to explain it all and move the plot along.Not only is it Clarke's film, but it's not really a sequel, except to a film that never existed: Clarke's film of 2001 - which, had it been made, would have been a very different animal indeed from Kubrick's magnificent opus. It would have been very like this feeble thing, and Bowman's last words would have been the tacky 'My God, it's full of stars!' The fact that no such film was ever made hasn't troubled the makers of this one - they've simply pretended that it was.But, happily, Kubrick made 2001 - took Clarke's core idea, added humanity, wisdom and wonder, and made of it a thing of beauty. Who knows what monstrous hubris moved Hyams to believe he had the stuff to carry the work onward, or Clarke to believe that he could architect it. Clarke had previously stood as the co-creator of 2001, but this film reveals him as a mere contributor.CD",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

117,fundaquayman,misguided bravery -- 2010 v. 2001,6,26 July 2006,"I think it was both a brave attempt and a misguided move for 2010 to have been made, and for no reason other than that any questions 2001 can provoke the audience to ask are not meant to be answered in our lifetime.Prior to the time 2001 was made, there have not been many major Hollywood films that dare to take the approach of using lack-of-clarity as the intended pay-off. Kurosawa did it in 1950 with Rashomon as a break-through, but it is an entirely different topic than that of 2001--a story that, at the time it was made, the available science and technology could only provide conjectures to what belies in space travel, and the mysteries to the world outside our atmospheres... those myths still remain today.Remember the film was conceived and made before mankind had ever set foot on the moon. With all the research Kubrick invested in with consultants and Arthur C. Clarke, he knew it was better to have more questions unanswered, than to risk giving answers history and science could soon prove wrong... this is probably his greatest achievement as a story-teller with 2001: A Space Odyseey. If you watch the film again, try to count how many items, as well as technologies shown within are completely off based on what we actually have in application today. Aside from brand logo's, and maybe the details to how computer interfaces may differ from what we have today, there is nothing shown in the movie you can argue as ""outdated"" or are completely wrong. If that is not the work of a visionary, I don't know what is. While I don't know if Kubrick himself deserves all the credit, as he certainly had the help from the best talents available, to accept the challenge and be able to convince a major studio such as MGM to entrust a production of that scale, and have enough sense to understand that sometimes it is better to not try to provide an answer when you may not even know what the question is, that is genius at work.It is not difficult to come up with a story and make a film that is confusing, and there are plenty of those for us to forget. What Kubrick & co. came up with is confusion that is at the same time compelling and thought-provoking... not to mention his film in many ways influenced designs in the future. Citing Dr. Strangelove as another example, he created the concept of a ""WAR ROOM"" that had even Ronald Reagan asking to see when he became President of the United States, which to his disappointment, didn't really exist.2010 is a good film, but it will always be derivative, always in the shadow of 2001, and always pale by comparison. Think of X-files the TV-series in its first 3 seasons, and how everything went downhill when it became a movie, the fault was not in the production value or lacking in writing talent, but the mere fact that the ""payoff"" that served to be the original and strongest hook was its ability to make us keep big bold question marks floating in our heads.Imagine LOST having a resolve... that would be the end to the magic.By making 2010, detractors of the narrative approach to 2001 will be satisfied, while fans of the original will object... and by virtue of its attempt to provide answers, it adds an expiration date to the story. Little did they know then that in just 6 years after the film was made, the COLD WAR would be a has-been.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
118,AIANDAS,Debacle,2,9 October 2019,"I wanted to see this after all these years again b/c of Helen Mirren.Helen Mirren aside who was good in this moronic sequel is beyond belief in
how bad it was.Where do I begin? The Casting for openers. Dr Floyd was a very serious man
in the Kubrick masterpiece. Roy Scheider is soooooo out of his range in this
one it's not even funny. He sounded more often as Buddy Russo in The French
Connection rather than a scientist who is attempting to solve the riddle of
existence. It was absolutely comical.Then you have the soundtrack which was absolutely corny. Kubrick used
classical music to an integral effect and 2010's corny electronics was
insulting even by 1984's standards.I started to think what came before this debacle in terms of technical
sophistication and the first thing that comes to mind Alien 5-years before
in 1979. Guess Ridley Scott wasn't available b/c if he had taken over this
project you can bet he would have made a masterpiece.The 2-outstanding performances were from Helen Mirren who speaks fluent
Russian and Bob Balaban who had the pedigree of CE3K.The rest of the cast and production are totally and completely forgettable.The last thing about this debacle is it may hold a promise for someone to
answer the question of the monolith. This question was never resolved and
maybe in the hands of a master say Christopher Nolan or even Ridley Scott
could do it justice.Now that I would like to see. But first the story. Who will write this

He is way out of league. That said, 2010 is much better than total catastrophes like Capricorn One or End Of Days.With 2010 he manages to pull off a descent main stream movie without any catastrophic blunders, except for his always bad timing and rhythm and some half hearted zero gravity effects. But it isn't as good at it should have been, considering the novel.Next year Hyams is coming up with yet another sci-fi movie build upon a literary classic: A Sound Of Thunder, a great novel by Ray Bradbury.

122,Artdoag2,"In the future, there are no lightbulbs",7,19 December 2003,"I wondered that when the interior of the Leonov (CCCP ship) was so freegin' dim. Or maybe the Ruskies were trying to save power by keeping all of the lights off! That really piqued my curiosity... On the whole, 2010 is an above average, yet not superior movie. If any fans of AC Clarke's series have read the book ""The Odyssey File"", which chronicles the making of 2010 (the book is composed of e-mail correspondence between Clarke and director Peter Hyams. They were among the first users of e-mail technology - in 1984!) reveals the director's paranoia and even humility as he hopes his film will even come close as a worthy successor to the peerless original. That peerless original, of course, is 2001.2010 is dated, somewhat forgotten, and does fall short of the power of Kubrick's vision (how many times have you heard THAT before?). But Stan the Man is a hard act to follow. While 2001 is timeless, 2010 reveals its easily dated personality on a couple of occasions. The Cold War theme is the most obvious. The computers, monitors, and graphics used throughout are instantly identifiable, dressed-up Commodore 64-era tech hardware. Roy Scheider's character, Dr. Floyd, instructs his crew to ""listen to your cassettes"" to receive updates on their mission. Okay, so that line of dialogue wouldn't fly past 1992, when CDs were on the verge of killing the audio cassette star (*). But 2010 is not without merit. It follows its predecessor's footsteps to a faithful degree, filling in the aftermath of the Bowman-HAL fiasco, and the slew of interesting and dangerous ramifications it created.Peter Hyams obviously set out to create a cerebral, based-in-reality production, unlike the other sci-fi movies of his day, which gave 2010 a distinct image. Return of the Jedi came out the year before, 1983, and the moviegoing public was probably still hot on heels of the Star Wars depiction of space movies, which I assume hurt the box-office chances of 2010.It is a dated, yet hidden gem, crafted together with solid intentions and performances. The supporting cast of Helen Mirren, John Lithgow, and Bob Balaban play off each other very well and supply some thought-provoking and entertaining moments. The scenes with Bowman and Floyd are gripping, as is the later dialogue between Bowman and HAL. There are no explosions or corny ""director tools"" used, and the special effects (well, excluding the interior computer sets of the Leonov) were not revolutionary but get the job done.2010 hasn't enjoyed the staying power of its contemporary brethren (Blade Runner, 1982; the Star Wars trilogy, 1977-1983; Alien/Aliens, 1979, 1986) and is a circle-square comparison to 2001.

There are valid arguments for both sides, although I do find people who are going to give a sermon on ""What 2001 is All About"" are being a little pretentious, as Arthur C. Clarke himself has implied that he and Kubrick's intentions were to be vague when they made 2001.What amazes me about this film more than anything else is the presentation of just how immense and lonely outer space truly is, and how utterly insignificant and frail we and our piddly spacecraft really are (a carryover of the ""womb"" concept from 2001...).  Dr. Chandra hyper-ventilating while spacewalking over Io/Jupiter causes my breath to catch every time.  I thought this concept was addressed pretty well in the original - especially Frank Poole's freaky murder - but is even more spectacular here, with all of the bright colors.I also enjoyed how things were breaking on the Leonov, again reinforcing that whole inferiority concept.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

The sooner the better, once the USA's arrogance is gone from this planet the better chances this planet has to survive into the future.This arrogance is apparent in this US made non internationalist movie, too much is made of the evil Soviets and the ""Hot dog"" loving Americans who of course are humans and the Soviets are something less than human - utter American 1980's paranoia. Had the USA done its espionage correctly during the 80's they will have seen from high above in their spy satellites that the Soviet Union was in fact a flawed and buckled society which outwardly tried to give an image to the world of integrity and strength, and in 1991 that inner falsehood came to the fore and the Soviet Union disappeared overnight.Yet again, Americans are the only level headed people in movie land, this arrogant film with not so much as a mention of any other world powers or even a reference to their roots - Europe in this film, makes this attempt at resolving the 2001 film a truly sad, arrogant, self obsessed, paranoid film with absolutely no forward thinking attributes like its predecessor 2001 - A Space Oddysey.Stanley Kubrik although an American, had an internationalist outlook of the world, must have taken one look at the script and idea in this sequel, screamed with fright and run out of the door.If ever you have this film on TCM to view, skip it, it's utter rubbish.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

However the fact that this film is also a sequel to one of the most powerful, original and awe inspiring motion pictures in history forever plunges it into a shadow from which there is no escape.  Indeed, 2010 commits the ultimate movie sin, it is BORING.  Roy Scheider is horribly miscast as Dr Heywood Floyd, John Lithgow passable as Walter Curnow and Bob Balaban inexplicably appearing as Dr Chandra, HAL's ""creator"".  Only Helen Mirren, drawing on her personal Russian background, brings any flair to the screen, the other actors stumble around like so many others who dont ""get"" science fiction spouting technospeak without the slightest hint of comprehension.  Keir Dullea literally walks around the sets in a daze as the spectral reincarnation of astronaut David Bowman while making up for lost time with HAL as Douglas Rains provides a reprise as the voice of the wayward computer who's past evil is finally and logically explained.Another reviewer praises 2010 for being coherent in opposition to 2001's incomprehensibility.  I disagree completely.  2001 was staggering in its visual impact and provocative in its narrative style.

And the series couldn't be complete without Keir Dullea or Douglas Rain reprising their roles as Bowman and HAL respectively.Even though they date from 1984, the visual effects hold off astonishingly well. I was especially impressed with the rippling Jupiter (early CGI) as well as the attempt-to-hook-onto-Discovery scene. My main problems with the movie come from the fact that it is very dated now (in terms of world politics and technology), but that could not have been help. It also is kind of a let down to be told the reasons for some of the events of ""2001,"" but again that is only the novel's fault.

With it's running time of one hour and fifty-eight minutes it leaves out some of the moments that took time in the novel. All in all though it was a very well done sequel lacking some of the scale of the first but still hits within the same area.

131,daryahorenko,"Great, however very disappointing",8,18 May 2018,"Let's get the obvious out of the way first and compare this movie to its predecessor
What made the original ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" so special was its cinematography, the extremely elongated shots, the use of complete silence in outer space while the camera is ""outside the austronauts' helmets"", the score made up of strange noises in the second half of the movie and the insanely slow pace, all of which drew the viewers into the movie and hypnotized them. This movie however is ""just"" a normal science fiction movie, the length of the shots is normal as we know it from most movies, not noticable to someone who hasn't seen the original movie in this franchise. We do get shots that attempt to recreate the silent shots from the first movie, however we're inside the astronauts' helmets, so there's several sounds - transmissions, talking and breathing. The score features classical music, just like the first movie did, however it features it throughout the whole movie, there's no strange noises that made the second half of the first movie so mystical. This movie is in no way the hypnotization the first movie was.However, I was still drawn into ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"", or as you might call it, ""2010"". Besides the first line that I genuinely thought was a glitch in my copy of the movie, which was very distracting, this is quite a good science fiction movie. You might be invested in it mostly because you want to know what happened after the original, but there's a few more reasons to care about the movie, such as the political climate that is set up in this movie or the family of our new main character. There's a creepy scene involving them that I really enjoyed. The best thing about it however is the suspense and we get a lot of it.In conclusion, this is quite a good, however very disappointing sci-fi movie. As it's based on the sequel novel on whose predecessor the first movie was based on, the story is still great, but it suffers from its biggest flaw - not letting Stanley Kubrick, the director of the original direct it, which led to a very different movie that didn't understand what made the original so special. It's definitely worth a watch though, but do NOT watch it if you didn't see the first one.

After doing so, I viewed 2010 under the guise that while it seemingly doesn't rate nearly as high it might/would provide some additional light on the ""monolith"" and it's aura. Taken under that simple premise, 2010 was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It takes nothing away from the spectacular mind provoking saga that is 2001, it just adds further perspective without taking away your individual perspective to interpret as you wish Kubrick's original. Don't try and compare it to 2001, just view it as some additional information to add to the pantheon. What's wrong with enjoying something that expands upon the wonderment of the next enterprise, instead of the typical gloom and doom? Surprisingly good performances, reprise of HAL and Dave, and interesting effects make this a must view if one feels like exploring the concepts introduced in 2001 a bit further. Just don't take an artistic or arrogant viewpoint that anything beyond Kubrick's 2001 pales; if you view it on it's own individual basis you'll find this a worthwhile viewing experience.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
135,catmydogs,A Great Sci-fi film!,8,14 January 2021,"The reputation of ""2010"" as an inferior film is unfair, as viewed upon its own merits, it is really an exceptional film. The effects are great, the humanistic story is very solid, and acting is wonderful all-around. This is also a faithful rendition of the Clarke novel.Compare ""2010"" to other hard sci-fi films of the past 30 years, and you'll probably realise this is one of the top ten during that period. Miles better than Moon or Sunshine or Intrastellar, Europa Report, or the Solaris remake.While I still consider ""2001"" as the best sci-fi film of all time, ""2010"" is a very worthy sequel that manages to paid homage to the original while making the story more accessible. Not an easy feat, and kudos to Peter Hyams the director for doing such a great job!",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
136,ilovejack104,"Good film, but nowhere near the original",6,23 April 2007,"A rule of films is NEVER try make a film sequel to be better than the original. It sometimes doesn't work in your favour, well in my opinion. Although there may be VERY rare examples of sequels being equally as good as the original, but NEVER beaten.(2010 v 2001) only seen this film once, i thought it was a good film and as many people i see that have commented on 2010 say, this film basically EXPLAINS 2001, which i must say i'm GLAD i've seen 2010 to help ME understand 2001, as BRILLIANTLY complex that 2001 is.2010 has very good visual effects also, but 2001 equals them, although 2010 is 16 years younger.I would watch 2010 again.

137,pranakhan,Excellent sci-fi... give it a chance!,8,23 May 2009,"This is an excellent SCIENCE-fiction film. It carries on the story introduced in Kubrick's ""2001"", and ties up many loose ends and clarifies what happened in the first film. The effects are excellent even by today's standards, the acting is believable, the characters are well-developed, its pacing is tight, and its plot is well-executed. Finally, this is TRUE science-fiction, not space-opera, and I wish more movies were like this. I hope someone worthy picks up the remaining 2 Clarke novels for the screen.Now:1. To everyone saying this is a weak film because it doesn't match the depth, mystery, and style of Kubrick's 2001: You guys need to open your minds a bit! It's ridiculously unfair to measure this sequel, or any film, against 2001. It is, frankly, impossible for ANYONE to produce a film that matches Kubrick's style unless that someone *IS* Kubrick himself! 2010 was not produced to COMPETE with 2001 at all, the director stated that he never would have produced this film without Kubrick's and Clarke's BLESSING. I'm sure the director deliberately avoided copying any of the style of 2001 at the risk of failing miserably and upsetting his own idol. Kubrick told the director to make this movie his own, thus the director did! If you go cynically comparing all sci-fi films to rare masterpieces you will only end up ruining your own chance of enjoying them for their own merits. It's like saying all music is of dubious value because it wasn't composed by Beethoven! You're only hurting and embarrassing yourself.2. A number of reviewers felt that the monitors on the ships (actual CRTs built into the sets) look cheesy due to their pixellated graphics and curved faces. Well, you guys are assuming that Kubrick's film has flat panels because of some scientific rationale about the future. Did you think that maybe Kubrick didn't use CRTs on his sets was because they did not have color CRTs available in 1968 that were small or cheap enough to build into his sets? All his screens were flat because they used slide projectors to flash static images against the back of semi-transparent screens. Most images were hand drawn to resemble possible computer generated images. The original 2001 scene of the videophone was created by projecting a reel of film against the back of a screen. In 1984, the computer industry was just starting to explode, and color-CRT displays as small as 12"" were readily available! When those set designers sat down to think about what the ship of the future would look like, they rationalized that they would be full of CRT displays in 2010, which was only 27 years in the ACTUAL future! How could they know we'd have low cost high resolution LCD flat-screens after only 17 years? You limit your enjoyment by over-intellectualizing everything with a cynical attitude. Of course the graphics were blocky! They were rendered by REAL computers, not hand drawn by artists. I'm sure in 1984 they felt that was a great idea and a nod towards future possibilities! 3. Many people criticize the heavy amount of dialog in 2010 contrasted to the lack of dialog in 2001. Again, we're falling back on the ""not Kubrick"" style issue. Regardless, you do realize that the BOOK for 2001 was FULL of dialog, right? You DID realize that 2001 is not JUST a film, it has a companion novel several hundred pages long? Since it's a story developed by TWO people, and not just Kubrick, perhaps the lack of dialog is only one director's idea at visualizing the novel and not integral to the STORY itself? 4. Some have heavily criticized the scientific components of 2010, stating that Kubrick had NASA consultants available when he made his film, and that 2010 is weak in this area... Well, I'm wondering why you assume that it wasn't the same case for 2010? Do you have some kind of special insider info about the making of 2010? Because, I believe that there are numerous production notes readily available clearly stating that the director of 2010 was careful in this regard and had many scientific consultants involved in the production of 2010. There is a whole book containing copies of emails between the director of 2010 and Clarke! I remember reading that even Carl Sagan had input into 2010! Oh yeah, lets not forget that Clarke makes a brief cameo in the film, and that both Clarke and Kubrick appear on a magazine cover in the film? If that's not an official endorsement of the film's authenticity and canon, then I am sorely mistaken.I'm just getting tired of these seemingly angry, cynical, ego-maniacally tedious reviewers bashing the merits of decent films. These people often assume they're brilliant enough to understand what Kubrik (or any filmmaker) was thinking. Dude, you're not Kubrick, you're not a genius artist, you don't even make films! Cynical attitudes are self-destructive, intelligent people are by nature open-minded, and analyze things on their own merits and faults instead of holding everything against rare artistic standards from previous works. The merits or faults of any work are entirely subjective. Many people rate 2001 as one of the greatest movies ever only because all the smart-sounding people do. How many call 2001 a ""masterpeice"" because they truly, emotionally, and intellectually appreciate the work itself, or simply because it's Kubrick's? How many of you can even honestly answer that question without lying to yourselves? For the rest of you... if you are open-minded, and consider 2010 for what it is: a DIFFERENT director's take on telling a story from a DIFFERENT book, produced in a DIFFERENT era, then you will enjoy this movie, appreciating that it stands on it's own as one of the top science-fiction films made. And I bet you really enjoy yourselves when you watch movies too, even if they have some flaws.Good for you!",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
138,jtrascap,"Been there, done that, didn't need the book.",4,27 June 1999,"It's definitely a division maker, a film that splits it's viewers down the middle. If you're a 2001 fan then you'll hate it - the sense of mystery and discovery is lost as events and motivations are layed-out and explained every step of the way. If you didn't like 2001, wondering aloud what the heck you just saw, I suggest you do see 2010 since you'll love the directness of the workmanlike treatment.It's not a a put-down - it's just that the styles are so completely different that you have to consider the messenger as much as the message. 2001 was visionary in nearly every sense the word has -- it threw out the concept of the narrative (visual or otherwise) in an attempt to make you reach your own, personal conclusion of what happened. Rebirth? Ascension? Some Nietche-ish evolution to a ""superman""? You tell me -- 2001 expects quite a lot from the viewer that 2010 would much rather even mention.By comparison, 2010 is very much an old-fashioned Hollywood movie. It explains *everything*, step by step, and includes a Roy Scheider voice-over to help thread the small gaps in time between scenes together. The voice over is often beyond silly - it's in the lyric of a series of emails from Heywood to his wife who, it should be noted, is fearful for her husband's safety. Any spouse sitting through a reading of the atmosphere braking technique will probably not sleep for weeks. Any husband who could write that deserves a slap for scaring the beegeezus out of her.2010 is not a strong film - frankly, it's quite derivative. It's visual sensibilities leech directly into ""Alien"" while inside the spacecraft (from the control buttons and displays on the Russian craft, to the lighting of the of EVA room as Baskin and Lithgow take their walk to Discovery, to the smoky ""atmosphere"" in the interiors when discussing the ""troubles"" at home). Outside, Hyams tries and is successful in the sense of scope and grandeur of space, and out pitiful size in relation to the course of the Universe. While he apes Kubrick, probably to establish a sense of continuity between the two films, he is at his best in the action scenes as the Leanov (sp?) enters Jupiter space. Either way, you watch this movie and get the feeling you've seen it all before.To be fair, Scheider is very good in his role of Heywood Floyd, that is if you dismiss the style of the previous occupant of that role, William Sylvester, as only a Kubrick mannequin. Again, the camps are divided -- I believe I understand the tact Kubrick chose to take, the sense of human alienation and evolutionary boredom, and while 2010 puts ""real people"" in space and makes the voyage to the stars more human, this wasn't the goal of Kubrick. Kubrick wanted to show man at a spiritual, cultural and evolutionary dead-end, and so human reactions (like 2001's Bowman going after HAL) only escape from people as their vestiges of civilization fail them. Different approaches, different movies. So why compare them? Well, life's just not fair, now is it?If you really don't need to compare the two, you can enjoy 2010. It's not a bad film, it just doesn't give much credit to the intelligence of the audience. That may not be a bad thing, so long as it's entertaining (insert Jim Carrey/Adam Sandler joke here) and 2010 can be entertaining at times. So long as you dismiss 2001 as a separate work of art.If you have the time and the patience, see 2001 twice, giving yourself a week or two to let it all set in, and then remember that not everything in the Universe has added value by being strictly described.Actually, whenever I watch 2010, I often wonder if Bob Balaban, hanging in HAL's memory center, is really as nauseous as he appears. And to the people who believe Kubrick was egotistical for destroying his sets, he did so because of what happened after Spartacus: Once production has ceased and the company left Italy, nearly every gladiator film of the '60 were shot on his old sets, some even coming out before Spartacus did.Stanley Kubrick and Steve Reeves? Now THAT'S the ultimate trip...",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
139,tcuthbertson,A much different movie than the first one.,6,16 November 1999,"The first movie in the series, 2001, was a very artistic piece that had only moments of dialogue in its more than two hours of film.  2010 appears nearly apologetic in comparison, explicating somewhat excruciatingly every nuance of the plot through the main character's supposed messages back to planet earth.  All of the blurry details of 2001 are made crystal clear in this fashion.  It is a very wordy movie.Nevertheless, 2010 has images that can captivate audiences just as well as they did in 1984.  Today's movie goers will notice slight glitches in the special effects as well as a couple of discontinuities.  The movie also dates itself because the plot includes a lot of tension between the Americans and Russians.Because 2001 was such a great movie, 2010 tends to pale in comparison. However, it is still a very good science fiction movie and it is worth viewing (but probably not buying).",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
140,GWMJedi,Could've been better... could've been a lot worse,8,23 July 2000,"Ok, my bias: I am a *huge* Arthur C Clarke fan... and being a Clarke fan causes some difficulty in reviewing this film, actually.On the one hand, the film manages to capture the science behind Clarke's story as well as to stir the heart with moments featuring David Bowman and HAL, Chandra and HAL, the Americans and the Russians, Jupiter and moons in all their glory, and the monolith, everpresent and seemingly omniscient.On the other hand, the film is a *pale* shadow of the 2010 novel. The novel is a grande tour de force... the movie was purposely refocused as an anti-war pro-cooperation cautionary tale for the Cold War Era. Clarke worked with Peter Hyams on the screen version, so at least it carries the approval of the original author -- and the story *does* work quite effectively, even if a bit naively when seen from 16 years later.To the point: the film has what, for 1984, was very impressive special effects work (the pictures of Jupiter are REAL, by the way... straight from JPL in Pasadena). The acting was somewhat pallid, but within context this isn't as much a problem as you might think. The film is intelligent, heavy on plausible scientific content, and requires you to pay close attention in order to get some of its more esoteric points. A good film, worth seeing.
Finally, I must discuss the filmmaker's attention to detail -- 2010 is AMAZING on the little things:Watch the widescreen version; you'll see a funny old guy feeding the birds while Milson and Floyd are sitting in front of the White House: the funny old guy is none other than Mr Clarke himself.Also pay attention to a magazine cover at a nurse's station about 2/3 through the film, allegedly showing the American president and the USSR Premiere as the world slides towards war... in reality those are pictures of Mr Clarke and STANLEY KUBRICK. (If you don't understand why Kubrick is there then smack yourself; look up 2001: A Space Odyssey.)There are also: the OMNI cover with a picture of the monolith with a huge question mark in the middle of it, the disposable Budweiser container (think Capri Sun), the electric car seen briefly going down a hill in a father-son bonding moment, the flawless Russian lettering on the [now dated-looking] Leonov's monitors and keyboards, the flawless reconstruction of the Discovery ship interior -- Kubrick destroyed all sets from 2001 so the 2010 filmmakers had to reconstruct from footage of 2001 -- etcetera etcetera.Final word: SEE THIS FILM BEFORE YOU READ THE BOOK ON WHICH IT IS BASED.

141,UltimateTrekker,Why?,3,25 June 2001,"I've read many comments that suggest 2010 is superior because we know the answers.  Because they don't like questions being left open.I found 2010 to be spectacle.  Nothing more. We see great things, yea! People point out how wonderful the special effects were for having been done 17 years ago, but do they mention that 2001 was 23 years ago!These movies are not comparable as they are entirely different.  It's made for 2 reasons.  1.) Money  2.) ""We don't get it?"" For those of you who found solace in the ending of this movie, I pity you. Waiting 16 years to find out the monoliths were hear to create a second sun (which would completely destroy all life on the planet earth by the way) is the most empty an hollow completion I've seen to date.I had a feeling most of the good ratings are backlashes against the first film.  Please, don't say 2010 is good because 2001 wasn't, and visa versa. This movie is an overly long epilogue that fell victim to whatever crapped into most 1980's drama's and Sci-Fi.  It seems a 12 year old wrote the formula for that decade, and all but 10 movies followed.  Especially when special effects was in play.I'm not saying don't see it, like most movies, you'll want to see it (for the same reasons we've all seen Showgirls and Battlefield Earth)  You just have to see it.

This sequel is a sort of low-brow answer to the 1968 classic; surprisingly, it's almost great despite that, until it stutters into an embarrassingly sentimental final five minutes worthy of James Cameron's worst moments. It's a beautifully designed film that tries to counter Kubrick's unnerving visual symmetry by keeping every shot just off balance. Its cast is truly terrific, with underrated Roy Scheider giving one of his very best performances. Its fault lies in its ending; perhaps all along it was fighting a losing battle by trying to make sense of Kubrick's mystery. Still, it's much better than the pure sap of ""Contact."" One would only wish that Hyams at least could have held Kubrick's same respect for the silence of space. This is a sequel, after all; the properties of space should stay consistent. Compelling, but ultimately fails to make contact. If HAL2000 had read the end of the script, maybe Hyams never would've made it to production.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
144,Aquillyne,Underwhelming sequel still has some moments of greatness,5,25 January 2008,"'2010: The Year We Make Contact' (1984) is the sequel to the classic film '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968). However the only claim it has to being called a sequel is that it is based on the book that was a sequel to the book '2001' was based on ('2010: Odyssey Two'). Other than this link, the film shares none of the glory of the original - it had a completely different crew, which is manifested in the poor quality of its art, and it had a generally lower production quality, manifested in its poor effects, music, and execution.2010 isn't so much the year we make contact as the year the Space Odyssey story continues. After the USS Discovery spaceship was lost near Jupiter with its computer malfunctioned and its crew missing or dead, a joint US-USSR mission is sent out to discover what happened. Their only clue is the last transmission of the astronaut David Bowman - ""My God, it's full of stars!"" The story begins with the enigmatic atmosphere of the original and manages to maintain it, but with a lot less style. Despite there being plenty of room for the making of a powerful cosmic mystery, 2010 ploughs linearly through a step-by-step revealing of 2001's secrets in a way that betrays the depth of its questions by delivering overly simplistic answers. We discover why the HAL 9000 computer malfunctioned, and some of what happened to David Bowman - but thankfully the film leaves several questions open - and this is better than it answering every question in the same overly simplistic manner.Directed by Peter Hyams, the film has clearly attempted to be a commercial success of its own - it comes with an original subtitle, and doesn't even pretend to be making an attempt on the original, but rather focuses on getting the plot across in an easily digestible manner whilst tossing in some low-budget special effects. But Hyams was no fool - he realised that the attraction to the Odyssey stories lies in the mystery of the Monoliths - strange alien objects with an unknown purpose - and that it would be theatrical suicide to say too much about them; ultimately all he reveals is their dimensions - 1 by 4 by 9 - the squares of 1, 2, 3.The film still has its own moments of greatness. There are some incredibly tense scenes of difficult EVA manoeuvres, some poignant shots of the Monolith, and the iconic final transmission that literally echoes with mystery. Unfortunately the film still uses the ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" title music - this is unfortunate only because it uses it to bad effect. Rather than the incredible title sequence of 2001, ""Zarathustra"" simply plays over a slow fade-in on a shot of a satellite dish. The rest of the music of the film is originally composed and utterly underwhelming, sounding like every other low-budget sci-fi movie.Rather than the grand cosmic themes of the original, 2010 focuses on the Cold War. The US and USSR must cooperate on the mission if it is to succeed, and even when they do their efforts are stifled by political strife back down on Earth. Ultimately the film's thematic climax is peace, not cosmic awakening or evolution. But whilst this may be less involved, it is still nevertheless satisfying, and not too far removed from 2001's ideas; global unity and peace is a clear next step in human evolution, and indeed in the '2001' book the final act of the Starchild is to destroy Earth's nuclear weapons.If you are looking for 2001, 2010 will disappoint you. But if you are looking for an enigmatic story in space, 2010 will deliver. Bypass the low-quality visuals and the low-quality music, and what you have is a story of a mission under pressure from political tensions whilst in the background a cosmic mystery unfolds, culminating in ""something wonderful"". The film closes on a satisfying climax that is nonetheless completely unexplained - the purpose of the Monolith remains unknown, and it is with the open question of its purpose that the film cuts to its credits.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
145,DrLetoPicard,"Interesting, but no sequel.",6,6 December 2000,"Saw this film for the first time today. I've seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" many times. Never read the books (except for 3001, for some reason).""2001"" was one of the most finely crafted pieces of film in existence. It took film beyond a simple, linear storytelling medium and transcended it into a world of visuals, music, and emotion. Details such as the explanation for HAL's 'malfunction' and the significance of the monolith or the starchild were superfluous and open to viewer's interpretation. It wasn't necessarily a brilliant story - it was a brilliant film. In terms of films to compare it to, it comes a lot closer to ""Fantasia"" than ""Star Wars"". You didn't watch it - you experienced it.Now, for ""2010"". Sure, the Cold War subplot is dated and over-wrought, but I'll ignore that in light of when the film was made. It was a mistake, though, including something that so easily dates the film, in my opinion. Was the future of the Cold War really looking so bleak in 1984? Maybe, but it still seemed a little too implausible.As a film, it not only PALES in comparison to Kubrick's masterpiece, it simply isn't very good overall. It's a little long, the acting is a little over the top, everyone seems to be working under the burden of what came before. The only really well-done scene by the actors is the exchange between the Russian astronaut and Floyd during the aerobraking sequence. The Bowman scene labours under attempts to re-capture the magic of the aging sequences at the end of ""2001"". The plot is sadly predictable (excepting, perhaps, the 'wonderful thing' which I knew about from the final novel in the series). The special effects are unspectacular. The uses of ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" seemed to be in simply because it was expected, and the score otherwise is ENTIRELY mundane and un-notable. While it generated some tension at times, none of it even came close to the sound of Bowman's breathing juxtaposed with HAL singing 'Daisy', or being gently and unobtrusively informed that HAL was reading lips.This movie is for fans of Clarke's books who want to see them realized on-screen, and perhaps conventional sci-fi fans. If you're a fan of the first film for it's sheer uniqueness, avoid it, especially if you're not a sci-fi fan. And if you're a fan of the first film looking for explanations, go rent it again and find them on your own.

That's rare these days, in which so many movies are star vehicles, serious ""message films"", or outright political rant, or have such absurd, illogical plot devices that you can't get past them (i.e., ""Flight Plan"").This review was written on reflection of Roy Scheider's death.

What happened to Star Child Dave? I thought he went back to Earth to blow up all the orbiting nuclear devices and to show us 3 dimension trapped losers we we're all done. Oh well...life on earth goes on! This flick is a CLASSIC example of a film that tries too hard to conjure up the feel of its prequel. From HAL's clunky ""I'm afraid"" to Floyd's new version of Genesis at the end of the flick...it's clumsy and very dated. As many have mentioned, the thrill of 256 color computer graphics from the early 1980s is all over this film. Balban's tearful intensity during HALs final countdown was nauseating.

The inclusion of the cold war crap makes it a somber product of the eighties, immediately spoiling it... The great mix of personalities in the book is not reflected in the casting, and the ending is something you can only suffer through.In all, another occasion where the script writer/studios take liberties with a good book at their peril.

I didn't much appreciate ""2001"" at that age, but I did understand that many people respected it as an important film in the history of movies. (I feel the same way about the Beatles still.) I saw it again recently, and I enjoyed it. It is not perfect, and the special effects are lacking. It didn't bother me that the Soviet Union still existed; it reminds us perhaps why it got made in 1984 at the height of the Cold War in some respects. (I remind the reader that ""The Day After"" was not a random event, either.) I suppose today the great enemy would be China, or Putin's Russia which bears so much resemblance to the Soviet Union. I think the cast did a great job, although I have always found Bob Balaban extremely distracting in any movie or television show he's in. I appreciated having some answers to questions left by ""2001."" I do think its important to know why HAL malfunctioned; the fact that Floyd's contradictory orders in the name of secrecy caused the break-down is, I think, a criticism of government secrecy mirrored in the original film. The scene I am thinking of is the other scientists on the space station grilling Floyd about about the reasons for the closure of Clavius. I liked the ending narration of the movie, despite the fact that normally I detest such things.THis is a worth-while movie.

159,lawson4333,Better than the first one,9,6 October 2006,"I just finished reading some of the comments left for 2010, and would like to add my two cents. There are ""technical flaws"" in the movie, but lets not forget the reason it was made, to entertain. A considerable amount of research was done before they began filming. They got the names of the moons right, and if Jupiter were say 20 times more massive, it might have become another star, but this would certainly have changed the configuration of our solar system. The ""aero-braking"" scene was interesting, another thing that would hold true, the comment about the astronauts exposure to radiation. Jupiter is beautiful through even a small telescope, but a very nasty place to visit. The rotation time of the planet, Great Red Spot, even the small ring system (Not visible from Earth) are all evidence that the producer knew what he was talking about. Roy was very good as Dr. Floyd, but then he was great in Jaws also. The ""Cold War"" even 400 million miles from Earth was a nice touch. It's true that the pens would not have floated, and I question the dust of Io covering Discovery. Dave's appearances added a connection to 2001, that were well conceived. Now the big question: If the aliens had put the monolith on Earth to change apes into club-wielding men, and the monolith in Tycho Crater (which isn't near the Sea of Tranquility) as say a time line to let them know how far we had progressed, why didn't they want us to land and have coffee? And what was the scornfulness of 1-3-9? To prove to them we had learned to count? In closing 2010 was a great movie, I only wished they had made a third movie.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

If you want that, read a book, do a logic puzzle, I don't care.If you were disappointed with 2001 don't let that keep you from watching 2010. It's much better. The only bad point was (SPOILER) when that Russian guy got sucked into the monolith. The other nice thing was that there was some humor to lighten the tone (laughing can be therapeutic).

162,sandrasguy,Most intelligent sci-fi film ever made,10,25 January 2009,"In an era where just about every sci-fi film has evil aliens taking over human bodies as part of a plot to eat all the humans while taking over the ship and planet while buckets of blood are tossed everywhere, this is a very welcome change of pace.In 1984, while the movie was being made, the film makers worked closely with NASA and the publishers of OMNI magazine to get every aspect of this movie correct. There aren't any over the top lapses of technology in this movie as every scene was carefully weighed in the reality of what was known about space travel in 1984.This is a great stand alone movie as it is a sequel, where the sequel is much better than the original. The opening minutes of the movie spell out many of the loose ends left by the original, then we find out that a perilous joint U.S./Soviet space mission has to take place to fix a very broken spaceship while solving a mystery left by the original movie. The mission has to take place in the shadow of a US/Soviet stare down over Central America.Roy Scheider and John Lithgow are in excellent form in the movie, with Lithgow showing how he was a great movie star before becoming a TV star who would say or do anything to take home a buck. Russian actors played the cosmonauts, so the accents aren't fake or intermittent. The tension in several scenes are reminiscent of great performances you would see on Masterpiece Theater. In a way, it's Shakespeare in Space, as the bard would've written something like this had he known about space travel.It is a two hour movie, relying on the viewer to actually pay attention and eschew the desire to see cheap effects and plot lapses. If you can watch the Royal Shakespeare Company do Hamlet, and enjoy it, you'll enjoy this movie.

The acting is first rate throughout, with superb casting and Roy Scheider in one of his best films since Jaws.The atmosphere generated by both films (more so, this one) is down to the excellent writing behind them.  Arthur C.Clarke had a vision of a future and although he admits being 100 years out (talking today) there will be a time when computers like the HAL 9000 and expeditions into space take place just like in the films.I only hope that sometime in the future, the two novels 2060 and 3001 will make it from paper to film.I recommend this film to anyone, it is enjoyable for all the family.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

Roy Schneider is badly cast and this is clearly intended as a moneyspinner, playing as it does on the Cold War tensions of the time. The characters are mostly very thin and the first half suffers as a result, although the film is somewhat successful in recovering as it edges toward a conclusion that, while far from convincing, at least provides a sense of closure. Although it tries very hard to pick up the loose ends of the original, these two films are further apart than any other original and sequel I can think of, and are best regarded that way. This film is akin to an asteroid insinuating itself upon the iconic original's gravitational field, but orbiting at great enough distance so as not to spoil the view. As a stand-alone film: 4; as a sequel: 1. I'd forgotten it once and can do so again.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
168,DarkMoon72,"A good movie, but nothing compared to 2001",6,14 November 2002,"2001: A Space Odyssey is my favorite movie of all time. After hearing a lot about 2010, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, and I didn't get one, either.2001 is a timeless classic that shows you the majesty of space travel and weaves the special effects of 1968 in wonderfully. It also throws lots of questions at you, and I was pondering these questions for weeks after I first watched the film. It makes you think and answer the questions on your own, and that combined with Stanley Kubrick's constant use of the theme of loneliness make it, in my opinion, the best film ever.2010 is a terribly dated, 1980s we-should-stop-the-cold-war flick with lots of easily fixable problems which, unfortunately, no one ever bothered to fix. Kubrick has a habit of keeping the camera focused on one particular point until you finally want him to change camera angles, and he does. But not very often. 2010 is not like that at all, with the director giving it a rushed feeling right from the beginning, when he simply can't hesitate to cut away the second after ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" is finished.But that is one of many problems. Kubrick's characters in 2001 appeared, for the most part, non-human, in what was probably a deliberate effort to compare them to HAL 9000 and ask the viewer how the two are any different. In 2010, the characters all have families that are shown and they all emote to degrees that would simply sicken Kubrick. What was a wonderful commentary on the human condition was thrown away so that people could be entertained. Next, simple little things in 2001 that went a long way are forgotten here, like the fact that sound doesn't travel in a vacuum, spaceships are supposed to be efficiently designed, the special effects and computer graphics are not supposed to resemble the present day in any way, shape or form, and classical music - preferably the Blue Danube - should be played when there are lingering shots of spacecraft flying around, not a cheesy, echoing narration in the form of a letter from Heywood Floyd to his wife. This same narration was responsible for giving away everything about both movies and ruining the potential for thought and debate after the movie. The viewers who like having everything explained to them (in the worst possible way, by being talked at) will enjoy it, but those viewers who want to find out the answers for themselves will feel patronized. A line was added into 2001 without our knowledge - Dave Bowman saying ""My God, it's full of stars!"". While this isn't a bad line to add at all, it simply wasn't there in the original 2001, and it just made me shake my head at this inconsistency. To cap off the little things that bugged me, the characters in 2010 are wearing NASA-type flight suits and modern clothes and no one wears any of those nifty-looking uniforms that were present in 2001, not even Dr. Floyd himself.The final insult is the fact that this film belongs in the 1980s. 2001 was able to impress me to no end even when I first watched it the year it was supposed to take place, and the fact that it didn't come true is easily overlooked. Not so with this film. A Cold War backdrop is shown here, with the two powers on the brink of war with each other, which, frankly, just looks silly nowadays, with the Cold War and Central American excursions behind us. Had this not had a godawful subplot of the world about to be destroyed, I probably would've enjoyed this film a lot more.
However, for all it's problems, 2010 has its moments. It's wonderful to see Keir Dullea come back as Dave Bowman and Douglas Rain reprise his role as HAL (even though HAL's voice sounds a bit muffled in this film). I would've liked to have seen William Sylvester back as Heywood Floyd, but in his place Roy Scheider does a decent job (when he's not narrating). It was good that the makers of 2010 didn't forget about Dr. Floyd's daughter, and he mentions her in the movie. The computer report that takes place in the very beginning is a good way of showing people what happened in 2001. Finally, although Kubrick destroyed the sets of 2001, the Discovery still looks very similar in 2010, right down to the logic center where Dr. Chandra re-activates HAL.All in all, a fairly good movie, but nowhere near the majesty of 2001. Simple tweaking here and there would've make it 100 times better. I give it a 6/10.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
169,jaredsalinger,Well Done Sequel to 2001,9,6 May 2009,"2010 may not have as much of the subtle, surreal, finesse of 2001, which is something I love so much about Kubrick's films; however, I think and feel that 2010 managed to capture much of the essence of its predecessor. Naturally, the lack of Kubrick's indefinable directive genius, and the stigma of being compared to 2001, puts 2010 at a disadvantage.2010 captured a sense of the period in which it was made. This is true for 2001; as the period of its making (the late 60s) come through in little ways such as attitudes and fashion that reveal the decade to the observant eye. In 2010, there is an essence of the 80's that comes through. not just in attitudes and fashion, but in the way the film was made, which is indicative of the best 80's Sci-Fi films. All things considered, and especially after watching 2010 without overly comparing it to 2001, I see 2010 as one of the best 80's films made, and a well done sequel to 2001.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
170,eduardo-g-melguizo,"It fails in its representation of ""something wonderful""",6,19 March 2016,"the main failure of this film is that it fails to go from the build up to that ""something wonderful"", to some kind of stasis or moment that make you really believe that something has changed and governments would change from the war path they were headed towards.by showing so directly the ""mystery"" (therefore making it no mystery at all) the sense of wonder goes out of the window and what should have been a decent climax for the film collapses.as some people said before, technology and graphics might be outdated, but someone focusing on that might do better not watching films produced more than 6 years.as per the relationship with computers and AI, it is surprisingly handled in too little time even it is meant to be one of the main concerns since the beginning of the film. somehow it feels a rushed production, probably in order to keep it under the 2 hour mark.

It seems the best way is to make something very different, but utilize the world and ideas of the original.2010 executes this strategy almost perfectly and is a scifi classic on it's own right. The sad thing is, it still won't be remembered as such, but as a sequel to a film that didn't need one.Not to mention that poor 2010 has history conspiring against it as well. The large part the cold war plays in the film dates it way beyond it's years.Yet, 2010 would more than earn it's place in the history of science fiction.

172,chrisr_70,Not bad,6,20 October 2005,"You have to ask yourself; was a sequel to 2001 necessary? 2010 does exactly the opposite of 2001, by telling the audience what it wants them to know, and not give them that stimulating freedom of narrative exploration. They are two different movies, but unfortunately are the same story. 2001 asks the questions, 2010 mainly gives the answers. Although I think 2010 isn't anywhere as good as 2001, at least it exists to satisfy those people who insist on having the answers revealed, and put to rest niggling questions. But I honestly believe Kubrick just didn't want this, what he really wanted was for people to carry on asking themselves questions of 2001, his intention was to have people exploring their narrative throughout the film and even when it had finished. Will the answers revealed in 2010 change the way we view 2001 when we next come to watch it? Yes, because you'll know why Hal goes crazy and you'll know more about the monolith. Knowing this might actually excite some people but remember it was not Kubrick's intention for the audience to know this. It actually conflicts with what he intended 2001 to do to us, which isn't a good thing from his point of view, because we aren't supposed to know any answers. But 2010 is worth watching, Scheider and a few other actors put in exciting performances. What I liked about this film was the chemistry between John Lithgow and Elya Baskin, and Hyams was highly successful with delivering a realistic fictional feel of floating in space; brilliant shots and intense breathing sounds made this possible and it makes my stomach turn every time. Don't expect a fantastic orchestral soundtrack though, there isn't much music. The film's rhythm is OK, but it certainly isn't polished well as there are several rediculas editing errors. But this is still a good film so I recommend you watch it, and to be fair 2001 is a unquestionably a hard act to follow.

174,jmbunnell,FIVE REASONS WHY THIS FLICK SUCKS,5,23 September 2003,"I saw this movie last night for the first time.  I was with three friends that love watching and criticizing movies as much as I do and couldn't believe they LIKED this movie.  I thought it was terrible and I'll tell you why.FIRST - this movie is a sequel to a really good movie.  The problem is that 2010 does not stay in the true spirit of 2001.  Yes, they are both sci-fi, but 2001 dealt with issues like ""Can science and space exploration solve all answers?"", ""What if we find something we aren't prepared to find?"" where 2010 was just a lame plot sci-fi flick.  They touched on some of those issues, but it was a plot driven movie not really concerned with answering life's deeper questions.  Unless, of course, watching a ghost turn into a fetus really answered some troubling question for you.SECOND - The plot is just sad.  Get there quickly then realize being there is bad so get back quickly.  The added cold-war element was interesting, I guess.  To be honest, it seemed cheap to me.  I was p***ed to find that it turns out that the monoliths were creating a new sun.  A second sun? That's not even physically possible!!!  Can you even call a movie science-fiction if you throw science out the window?THIRD - I always liked the limited dialog in 2001.  It gave space a cold empty feel, like it probably really has.  Think about all that was said in 2001 with such limited dialog.  Then you got 2010 with lines like ""How do you say 'dumb' in Russian?"" or ""Whether we are based on carbon or silicon makes no fundamental difference. We should each be treated with appropriate respect.""FOURTH - How do you do so little with such a stellar cast?FIFTH - I really like some of the camera shots in 2001.  That is usually not something I think about.  Just some of the shots were so visually spectacular.  In 2010 I caught myself thinking on more than once how poorly scenes were shot.  If someone NOT IN THE BUSINESS is seeing lighting problems, then they've got to be BIG problems.I just didn't like this movie.  It irritated me.  It didn't even entertain on some basic level.

175,TheRichardT,A superb sequel truly befitting of the classic original.,10,11 April 2002,"Director Peter Hyams has constructed the perfect sequel.  In the original 2001, director Stanley Kubrick wanted to have the ""Star Child"" detonate the nuclear warheads circling the earth, but felt that this would be to close to his previously released ""Dr. Strangelove"".  In this case Hyams (along with astronomer/oceanographer/writer Arthur C. Clarke) have closed the circle on so many questions.Clarke makes a cameo in the scene in front of the White House; which is cropped out in the ""formated for TV"" version. Superb music, sets, cast, crew and story come together to form an intellectual achievment.  (While not as purposefully mysterious as the original, it brings Clarke's message of hope (the film came out in 1984, very much in keeping with his superb book:  ""1984: A choice of Futures"".An ensemble cast (including many superb Russian actors; Dana Eclar may be excused for his accent, since his screen appearance more than makes up for it!).  As well as Keir Dullea (Dave Bowman) and Douglas Rains (voice of HAL) rekindling their parts.And the one scene with Bob Balaban trying to calm HAL's concerns as he knows that they are abandoning HAL to almost certain destruction.

I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU THE END OF THE FILM!!Granted, 2010 isn't the classic that 2001 was, but I still think it's enjoyable. One complaint people seem to have with the film is the ""bad science"" ending in which Jupiter is turned into a star. This is not as nutty as it may sound actually... Jupiter has been called a ""failed star"" because it is of the right chemical composition but is not quite big enough ... if it had been somewhat more massive it would have been compressed down by its own gravity and fusion could have begun, the way it did in our own sun for example. The monolith(s) gave Jupiter the squeeze it needed to start fusion on its own. The new star doesn't fry everything around it (e.g. the new life on Europa) because it's a small star, hot but not as big as the sun! Jupiter's got about a tenth the diameter of the sun, if memory serves...Clarke's book goes into all of this in more detail, and if you're gonna knock Clarke's science, well, that's your issue I guess. Granted, the film could have done a better job of explaining all this, the way the book did.Hope this explanation helps someone see the light!",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
179,hstilling,Destruction of a masterpiece,3,31 January 2016,"Some movies makes you ask the question ""Why was this movie ever made?"" even as you know the answer already.'2010' is one of those movies. It's obvious that Kubricks masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey' was going to have a sequel, to milk the last money out of the concept. So Arthur C. Clarke wrote a follow-up on his original book that was the foundation for the first movie.'2001' was not an action movie or a drama. It was something rare, as a sci-fi thriller. What made that movie so special was not any alien monsters, laser-weapons or explosions in space. Instead it was a visual masterpiece in both the set and decor, and of course the magnificent scenes with spacecrafts slowly maneuvering in space. Almost like a space ballet.And it was a thriller. The fear of the unknown and the mystery of the alien monolith, combined with the malfunctioning AI, was more effective than any monsters and beasts. '2001' didn't need a sequel. It was perfect as it provided more questions than answers, giving the viewer a lot to think about after the end-credits.'2010' tries to answer all these questions, and that is a shame. It is as if Da Vinci had painted another painting, explaining why Mona Lisa is smiling. The end of the original masterpiece.'2010' is nothing close to a masterpiece. It's no thriller as it is not scary and the suspense is down to a minimum. It's not an action movie, nor is it a drama. The characters are way too shallow and especially John Lithgow is embarrassing himself.So, should you watch this movie? It depends on your alternatives. It is still less entertaining to sit and stare at a wall, and worse movies have been made. But I can't help the feeling, that this movie is an insult to fans of '2001', and if you regard yourself as such, don't let '2010' destroy that for you.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
180,dionisinblue,"A nice try to explain ""2001: A Space Odyssey""",10,12 May 2005,"""2010"" was made as a sequel to ""2001"". Of course Peter Hyams, as many other people, thought it was a great movie that trembled the universe of the SyFi, so a sequel could be successful. Knowing that Kubrick destroyed all material used in the original film for the special effects (spaceship miniatures) in order to prevent anyone from making a second movie, they had to use the man's new best friend, the computer, to reproduce the spaceships. A difficult task, but successfully achieved.By trying to explain the mystery of 2001, this new movie is obviously inferior to the original one, but doesn't give a wrong explanation. I think that 2001 didn't need a sequel. A Kubrick film is hard or impossible to be continued. And for sure 2010 is more commercial so it's easier to watch. But I am sure that Kubrick hadn't had in mind Europa when he made 2001, so 2010 tries to stick with the reality, with the mystery of Europa's ice ocean, and tries to associate the process of life on Europa with the anomalies in 2001. In fact I think that Hyams did not understand pretty much of the last 20 minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but he brings in a new idea so the movie is saved.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
181,hippiefreak,Another disappointing sequel,3,31 December 2017,"I saw this movie 33 years after it came out. The original, 2001: A Space Odyssey, is my favorite movie. This 2010 movie gave me nothing to think about. The writers threw us some sentimental images of Bowman and of the Discovery so we might be excited at seeing old friends. The outdoor spaceship special effects were far inferior to the 1968 version. Why did that have to be? A low budget? The monolith was not black at every appearance in the movie. And when the spaceships MADE SOUND in the vacuum of outer space, that is heresy! I chalked that up to a post-Star Wars mentality. I found it annoying that the scientist who initially programmed HAL protected HAL almost like a lover. The original movie made me think as I watched. This sequel only made me watch the story-line cliches unfold. I was waiting for some Ewoks to show up.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
182,m.c.kenna,Steals the wonder from the first film.,6,9 July 2000,"2001 was a masterpiece, in my opinion the best film ever made.  The best part about it was that everyone who watched it gets something different out of it.  Everything is not explained, leaving you to your own conclusions. That is what made it great. 2010 robs the first one of it's wonder since it gives tangible, mundane answers to the abstract questions the first one raises.  If you loved 2001, save yourself the disappointment and don't see this film.  Though a good film in it's own right it is at the expense of it's predecessor.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
183,speacock,"Dated sequel to 2001, but not without merit",6,22 April 2014,"It was never going to live up to its illustrious predecessor, but like the curate's egg, there are good parts and bad parts.Quick plot description: There is a joint Russian-American mission in 2010 to Jupiter to find out what happened back in 2001. But something is waiting for them there....The saddest thing about this film is that it has dated very badly, worse, in fact, than 2001 itself. That has a 60s sensibility, but the way the technology is portrayed has a timeless quality; the mistake Hyams makes is to throw in the latest tech from 1984, which now looks incredibly primitive. What he couldn't have realised was that the Soviet Union itself would not exist in 2001, let alone in 2010. There were Russians in 2001 (represented by the late, great Leonard Rossiter), but there was no mention of the USSR.One small note: you may notice some strange whistling noise rising and falling on the soundtrack, later it becomes clear that this is what they thought cars would sound like in 2010.However, once you get past the clunky tech and the Cold War, you can enjoy the ride. The best parts of the film come from the characters; Scheider is a great Heywood Floyd, humane, warm, intelligent. Helen Mirren makes a great Russian captain, John Lithgow is funny and Bob Balaban is somewhat creepy as the Man responsible for HAL. The rest of the Russian crew is sadly under-used, with only two of them getting anything much to say.The special effects are reasonable and the wire work is not too bad, but in some places the effects are actually worse than 2001, particularly when they are outside where the colour matching is terrible.The music is typical '80s electronica, rather than the wonderful classical pieces that Kubrick used to such great effect. The occasional, inevitable use of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" only highlights that.The story itself is reasonably crafted, with some tense scenes and funny character moments. The ending is fine, if a little unconvincing, but it manages to retain some of the sense of wonder of the original.If it wasn't the sequel to one of the best SF movies ever made, this would be an exciting adventure to the largest planet in the Solar System. But it is and that makes it a little underwhelming. Watch it with low expectations and you will enjoy it, expect greatness and you will be disappointed.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
184,pacredgold,SCIENCE in a lot of the FICTION,9,8 June 2010,"I did not want to take up most of my time reading all the reviews but about half of what I have read are positive and half are negative. I have all four ODYSSEY novels (wish I could get my hands on THE LOST WORLDS OF 2001) and understand them well. The stories break far away from all space operas in the fact that most of the science is real (i.e., space travel is long and tedious, there is no sound in a vacuum, hibernation saves on resources, no instant communications, etc.).No doubt that, out of all the reviews I have read, none of them touch on one absolute science FACT about Jupiter. Studies have shown that Jupiter is emitting MORE ENERGY than it receives from the sun. Astronomers also call it 'the star that failed' and it failed because it only needs about another ten or twenty percent mass to become a small star, which is exactly what the Monolith aided in doing; henceforth 'Ingnition' in 2010. Life was already forming on Europa and the extraterrestrials (they are ubiquitous through the whole series) saw their chance to continue their 'experiments' on life (one tribe becoming stronger than the other). Maybe this new life on Europa won't evolve to bash their neighbors on the heads with NUCLEAR clubs.In the movie/book tie-ins to 2001 and 2010 Clarke explains that the DISCOVERY's trajectory was supposed to take it past Jupiter, fly around Saturn (a braking maneuver) and return to Jupiter, the center of the entire tetralogy. Clarke also placed the direct dialogue about his naming '...HAL to stay one step ahead of IBM...' in his novel 2061:ODYSSEY THREE.If you saw all the things that the Monolith did in the two movies you might realize that it is many things; a supercomputer that teaches, a beacon and 'radio', a 'gateway' or portal, a cosmic 'calling card' and a catalyst for change (as evidenced again in 2010). 'Multi-computer' might be a more apt term. ""...One by four by nine, the squares of one, two and three..."" (Floyd). Maybe that's the E.T.s' way of saying, ""You have to start somewhere. Take the first step into space, then the next...,"" and so on. Since mathematics is considered a universal language this might simply be a way for them to hope or expect us to decode their language.Clarke also collaborated with other astronomers on the possibility of the cores of dead stars being made entirely of diamond. (Here there be spoilers):This is the driving force that ran the plot of 2061. The rest of that story involves a rescue mission to Europa.For the periods in 1968 and 1984 we were in a cold war with the Soviet Union, our technology was CRTs, LEDs and LCDs, CGI was in its infancy along with home computers and the Internet was somebody's pipe dream. Sure, back then a telephone call from the space station (the ONLY PRACTICAL design) to home was 'only' five bits ($1.25). But, in looking at the future, you can only guess at any one possible outcome. Who knew that two of New York's largest structures, Washington D.C.'s center for the Military and a field outside of Shankstown, PA., would end up having airplane parts viciously fused together on a balmy morning in September, 2001? Who would have ever guessed that this country would ever elect a dark-skinned man as its leader in 2008? I don't even need to mention the cost difference of everything from wristwatches to automobiles and how our technology is now doing leaps, bounds and back-flips. SO DON'T TRY TO COMPARE LIFESTYLES BETWEEN TWO OR THREE RADICALLY DIFFERENT ERAS WHEN WATCHING THESE FILMS.Being the scientist that he was Clarke had plenty of material to work with. In 2001 he answered the Fermi Question ('Are we alone in the Universe?') In 2010 he addressed the 'failed star' theory by igniting Jupiter. In 2061 he used the 'diamond core' theory as the basis for another trip to Europa. In 3001 he theorized how far and deep our technology might expand; not just virtual reality but braincaps that actually enter the brain, a man-made torus that encircles the entire earth, even a 'language' that is a potpourri of all the planet's dialects.Finally, with almost all of the movie industry losing money hand over fist, WHY DOESN'T MGM FINISH THE SERIES??!! Clarke even said that the novels are different stories set in the ODYSSEY Universe. Again, they need to take lessons from George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and The Disney Studios.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

I wish the other 2 books 2061 and 3001 were made into films too, great books. I'd also like to know how they did those wonderful shots of Jupiter, with the moving clouds and all, remember this is before the Hubble space telescope. I recently saw an episode of Stargate SG1, made at least 15 years later, which had a shot of Jupiter, nice, but very still, well it is a TV series, limited budget etc. I reckon the reason the other 2 books were not made into films is because 2010 was a cinematic flop, too cerebral for average movie goers, not enough action/violence. If you want to moan about CRTs, take a look at the Star Trek movies, they start with wonderful flat screen 3D displays and end up with CRTs because they're cheaper than the special effects needed to produce a futuristic 3D display.

187,SpecialAgentScully,Much better upon second viewing,8,16 October 2006,"This is a movie that you won't appreciate at all unless you give it a real chance. That means giving it your full attention and listening to all the dialogue between the characters... not just having it on in the background while you're doing chores at home, only glancing up at the screen during high-action moments. While the visuals in the movie are good, they won't make any sense to you unless you're paying close attention. I know this because the first time I watched this movie, I didn't give it a real chance, and didn't think highly of it. The second time, I put in the effort and thus received the payoff-- I really enjoyed it.The best thing about ""2010"" is that it elucidates some of the mysteries of ""2001"" (which sure had a lot of mysteries). It also lets you know exactly what was *not* meant to be understood in ""2001""-- some things from that movie remain mysteries on purpose. After watching this movie, I had none of the puzzlement that I had after ""2001""-- which was refreshing. This movie makes the viewer feel uplifted and intelligent, rather than confused and dense as ""2001"" made me feel (and I know I'm not alone with that feeling).

And damn does Hellen Mirren do a mean Russian air force chick! She's always had that slavic look to her. Scheider was good too, the 20 foot rubber shark this time being replaced by the 3 km. long monolith.But the way the plot unfolded was perhaps a little to goody goody for my taste. Here we are after 2001, scratching our heads in deep thought, trying to grasp the significance, or at least the symbolism of the rectangular space rock. And now, the great answer is that the monolith was really some benevolent interdimensional ambassador, here to bring peace and love, jumpstarting glorious new civilizations if it had some extra time on its hands??? The same monolith that inspired those peaceful little astralopithecines to beat the hell out of anything that moved with those bleached femurs? Initiating the events which led to later, slightly more advanced primates like genghis khan, adolf Hitler, and george w. bush??? Naaahhhh, i don't buy it. The first movie gives a much darker, more uncertain feeling to what the true mission of the monolith was.

190,ZippysKingdom,gouging my eyes and ears out now...,1,25 March 2018,"With the 50th Anniversary of the original film coming up we sat down to watch it a few weeks ago - it still stunned, inspired and left me in awe. So, why not watch the sequel, right? Well, I feel soiled now... even putting aside the fact that 2010 was made before CGI (and obviously so was the first film) the special effects we laughable. The sets were cheap, the costumes unoriginal and cheap, the acting was dreadful and WORST OF ALL the soundtrack was, was, was... I just wanted to drill my ears out. One of the many amazing parts of the film 2001 was the musical score coupled with the absolute lack of sound - as it should be in space... here we had endless canned orchestral tracks to ""set the mood"" which at times were so distracting it was hard to know what was going on. We had sound in space (which a lot of other films do too), but we already had the precedence of the first film - no one would have faulted Hyams for continuity there.The casting in this film is just so bad - John Lithgow CAN'T be taken seriously, Roy Schneider doesn't fit the role, the ""Yakov Smirnoff "" look-alike was dreadful. The dialog was idiotic - the lack of professionalism by the crew, their childish expressions, the pointless banter, etc, etc - all so unrealistic, pointless to the film and distracting. I still have no idea who that random female crew member was that popped into Schneider's bunk for the laughably cheesy depiction of the atmospheric deceleration.The entire opening sequence with Schneider and his family could go - especially since later in the film in his overlaid messages to his family, he barely expresses feelings about them or says any lovey-dovey stuff - instead he talks about the mission - so why did we have to suffer through ""getting to know"" his family? Then there are all the inconsistencies concerning gravity or the lack of. In one scene, Schneider puts two pens into a free float to illustrate the two ships - WAIT, WHAT? All this time I'm working on the assumption that there is false gravity in that module because there is ABSOLUTELY no attempt by the film makers to illustrate zero G! When Dr. Chandra is in HAL's CPU it looks like he is standing on a rotisserie with some low paid stage hand rotating him... and he looks constipated to boot. I could go on and on.And, ""SAL""...

Contrasting to the mystery of its predecessor (2001: a space odyssey), 2010 offers answers to the questions it posed. Based on the equally excellent novel ""2010: Odyssey Two"", it sticks to fairly accurate science (with some assumptions grounded in science). Notably, it deviates in some subplots from the book, simplifying the plot, which works just fine. Unlike the classical pieces used in 2001, the music is mostly original work (except for the franchise-defining use of ""Also sprach Zarathustra""), composer David Shire does a great job capturing the sense of distance and grandness of space exploration.

Of course shouldn't really compare this traditional sci fi drama' thriller with the semi abstract art that is 2001 BUT...Watching this now, it's amazing how sloppy it seems both visually and script-wise. It's hard to believe there had been almost 20 years of advancement between the two films. The comping/matting technology developed in the late 70's now looks way cruder than Kubrick's (admittedly obsessive) in-camera approach in the late 1960s. Sure the VFX are much more extensive and adventurous, but they are let down by dumb decisions: the spherical front of the Discovery is way too small, like a playset, when the astronauts are seen interacting with it; closeups reveal many of the props are clearly made of wood, even the console around HAL's interface features bubbling adhesive and roughly finished edges in close up. The space helmets are always grubby and misted up. I guess they were going for a more 'realistic' look, but it just looked distractingly cheap compared to the work of two decades ago.Story-wise just too many weird decisions. Heywood Floyd inexplicably embracing the young Russian crew member during the atmospheric braking (who doesn't have a single line after that). Sending a man who has never space-walked before on a... spacewalk. No real explanation of what happened to the guy who went to probe the Monolith. Entrusting the psychotic HAL with running the Discovery ...presumably including life support. Even the main character, Floyd has no influence on any event, except as Bowman's messenger boy, convincing the Russians to abandon a months - long space mission with no explanation at all. Floyd denies he knew anything about the true Discovery mission, when in 2001 he was seen *on video* spilling the beans. Technically there's usual problems with random gravity inside the ships, office-type chairs with no restraints for half the crew during hi-G manoeuvres, bare wiring falling out of various components.And don't get me started on the hairbrush.

202,selenastoic,Book is far better- Magic of 2001 lost in translation,5,31 January 2021,"Let me start off by saying that this movie was not terrible, but its walking a thin line and crossing into that territory. It had its moments, such as the ""My God, It's full of stars!"" transmission from Dave Bowman. The inclusion of this in the opening scene gave me some sort of hope for the film, but it all went downhill from there:
Being a fan of the book 2010: Odyssey Two, I was extremely disappointed at the swapping of characters or lack of inclusion of characters.
In this film Dr. Heywood Floyd is extremely fast talking and sarcastic, nothing like that of the Dr. Floyd in the books. And he honestly says/does some real cringeworthy things, like when he's checking Discovery's orbit and proceeds to chuckle/laugh (I don't even know what it was) in the weirdest way for 10 seconds. I literally burst into laughter myself at how bad it was.The movie also changed the character of Captain Orlov to a man when she was a woman in the book, and completely omitted the husband/wife duo of the Orlovs. Dr Rudenko was also changed to a man when it's extremely clear that she was a woman in the book. Dr Chandra was Indian in the book and is a white guy in the movie. Also, Milson is loathed by Floyd in the book, but in this movie they're best buddies? Uh what?-The pacing is kind of weird; we jump from Dr Floyd saying goodbye and looking at Christopher in his bed to literally 2 years later when Floyd is waking up from hibernation.
-Another gripe I had is when Max was sent down into the pod to make contact with the monolith (why?? Never happened in the book) and then they kill him off and never talk about him again. Also, he's supposed to be this Russian badass but has a panic attack over the smell of rotting meat.
-The sequences of Dave Bowman visiting earth and his encounter with Dr. Floyd were pretty cool, probably the best parts of this movie. Even though Mrs. Bowmans death was pretty cringe, I enjoyed that they brought back the actor that played Bowman to bring a piece of the original masterpiece to the film.
-Dr. Chandra leaving the Discovery to board the Leonov as HAL is commencing ignition is another laughable moment. And none of the crew seem to care. And of course, he survives, no problem.
My last gripe is the over explanation of everything that's going on, the beauty of the first movie is that it had little dialogue, made you feel like you were right there in space with the crew, and left the ending up to interpretation. In this ending, everything is over explained and that sense of mystery is non existent.Overall I give it a 5/10",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

It definitely explained some major plot points of the 1st film which perhaps detracted from its mystery. However it did set the stage for a continuation of the saga by leaving its own set of questions.Graphically, by todays standards some effects look dated, but it has to be said most are still impressive. As 2001 did this film attempts to bring (as closely as possible) a feeling of realism to the SCIFI genre. Although it is clear now that we haven't mastered space flight as predicted by Stanely Kubrick and co, the ""take home"" messages are still as fresh as ever.

204,Jackdu44,bad,3,29 September 2007,"I didn't even know there was a movie sequel to 2001 until recently. AFter watching it i found out why. As a huge fan of 2001: A Space Oddyssey and Arthur C. Clarke's writing, i was hugely disappointed by this movie. I honestly feel like the makers of this movie shat all over Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. The movie didn't stay all that true to 2010: Oddssey Two, the book or stick with the general theme of 2001: A Space Oddyssey, the movie. 2001 is so timeless, I don't see how the makers of this movie could ruin this so bad. The entire movie felt so dated, very 80's. I recommend skipping this movie and instead reading the books which are masterpieces of science fiction. I'm glad i didn't pay for this movie, thank you bit torrent.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
205,gimmal,Sub-plot concluded in massive planet reformation,10,20 June 2010,"The story concluded in 2010, The Year We Make Contact, is, of course, a continuation of the story begun in 2001, A Space Odyssey. I'll draw some details from the books, to flesh out a brief plot synopsis, commensurate with the review.The story begins with pre-human colonies of apes. In the book, 2001, evolution is induced in one of the colonies, by way of a a monolith landed conveniently close to their dwelling area. It's implied, from knowledge conveyed later in the story, that the monolith was placed and controlled by a species of super-cosmic beings - to which Dave Bowman is later introduced.Following an initial induced-evolution experience, the apes colony begins to develop weapons from their own natural surroundings - as symbolized, in the film, 2001, with the tossing of a bone into the air, in a form that the later interplanetary voyager ship resembles, the bone tossing end-over-end. The evolved apes conquer the competing tribe (this is in the book, 2001) ...and the story jumps ahead, to the point at which we have a world threatening annihilation to itself, under the tensions of the cold war, and the weapons of the cold war. That condition of the world, at the time, becomes a theme, in the story, concluded (in the movies) not until the end of 2010.On the moon of our threatened planet earth, there's been a strange obelisk discovered - dubbed, Tycho Magnetic Anomaly (TMA) 1. The first day when sunlight strikes the monolith, the monolith issues a shrieking ""page"" message - the destination of which is computed by NASA signal experts. As I recall, it was Saturn, in the book, but Jupiter, in the move. That planet then becomes the destination of the bone-shaped interplanetary voyager ship - to which a computer named HAL is promoted to be AI captain, and a human crew assigned.Things don't go well, though, as HAL's artificial intelligence circuits begin to suffer a case of schizophrenia, for his conflicting mission directives - made very real, for the crew aboard the ship under HAL's control. Eventually, Dave bowman is forced to shut HAL down.In the meanwhile, the crew have not forgotten the big monolith, orbiting the planet, which the ship was dispatched to investigate. The monolith resembles, physically, the monolith seen on TMA-1, as well as the monolith in humanity's own deep-ancient history. That matter of continuity is more apparent, after reading the book.Dave Bowman ventures to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet, and is introduced to its functionality, as it being a sort of gateway device. This is portrayed, in the film, with a fairly stunning visual sequence - then capped off with the eerie ""cultural introduction"" Dave Bowman receives, once he's completed the last leg of his travel, as such. The nature of that scene is described, more, in the book, 2001. The movie 2010 begins with a rescue/salvage mission, the destination of which is the failed spacecraft from 2001. The crew proceeds unaware of Dave Bowman's further expedition, and unaware of the life found (in the books, at least) on the moon, Europa.The movie 2010 concludes when a swarm of monoliths have begun to issue out of the red-eye cyclone of Jupiter. The monoliths induce such gravity to that gas giant that it begins the fusion process characteristic of a star, and ignites the planet - while the crew of the 2010 ship rush away, to avoid becoming solar wind, in the physics of the new star.As I recall the movie, the last thing in the movie 2010 is the delivery of a message from afar - here, it's been credited to HAL - a message that has become one of the IMDb ""memorable quotes"" from the film: ""All these worlds are yours, except Europa. Attempt no landing there. Use them together. Use them in peace."" That, then, is the last message humanity receives, in the story, from the super-cosmic star-people civilization - who, in the story, started us on the path towards weapons development, in the first place, while kick-starting early evolution, on Earth. The significance of the planet Europa is explained, in the books.There are some subplots in 2001 and 2010 - as books and as movies - subplots that simply do not become clear, without at least reading the book, 2001, A Space Odyssey, and the book for 2010, as well. Like with other films based on ""thick-plot"" books, they had to leave some of the details out, in the making of the screenplay.Of course, the movie 2010 has a number of qualities that would make it ""fit"" as a sci-film, in its own rights. There's the massive rescue ship, the multi-national crew, the derelict HAL and the vessel to which he was given control, and the final, massive physical transformation of the gas-giant planet, in the birth of a new star. Physically, such a transformation would be no small feat, and would have pronounced effects both on the physics of our solar system, and on the psychology of any inhabitants of planets in the solar system. Both films were produced during the cold war. That feature of world culture, at the time, might have since faded for its apparent significance, in regards to the historic context of the original stories. In the universe of 2001/2010, and the cold war world of that story, it would take a massive planetary transformation, culminating in the birth of a new star, to shock the world out of a path towards world-wide nuclear annihilation - as real as that threat was, throughout that time in our real world history - incidental as that might be, however, at least to the founders of the monoliths, since they had initiated that planet-to-star transformation, apparently, for the sake of fostering life on Europa. Maybe it was a dual-purpose feat.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
206,Hanoying,Exceeded my expectations by a mile!,10,19 October 2009,"After finally having seen 2001: A space odyssey I wanted more. IMDb as always showed me the way and there turned out to be a sequel, the one you're reading about right now.Now I really didn't expect much out of this movie as I figured any sequel to the first part of the series wouldn't be able to live up to it's role and a 6.4 rating on IMDb tends to spell disaster but.. I was wrong! If anything I enjoyed this movie more. The acting is solid, the cinematography is stunning once again, open plot lines are picked up, new plot lines drawn up and brought together and to top it all off the movie ends in a way which can only be envisioned by the likes of Clark, Asimov and Heinlein.This movie is currently standing at a ridiculous 6.4. It deserves much more than that as it is without doubt one of the most enticing movies I've ever seen. District 9 an 8.6 and this jewel of a movie a 6.4? Oh please....",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
207,mr_periaktoi,yeah....this was bad.,3,2 August 2003,"My main problem with this film was the fact that in the book, the friction between the US and the Soviet Union was not a huge part of the plot, it was there a little....but that was it.  But in the film......that was pretty much what the whole movie was about.  I know this was made in during the cold war, but still, they added all kinds of unneeded things to a good story and left out many essential parts.  And one other thing.......in the book the Russians all had personalities and things that made them interesting........but in the movie they were just uninteresting, stereotypical ""mean Russians"" who of course got all kinds of things wrong and messed up things during the voyage, because ya know, they wouldn't listen us Americans and ain't as smart as we Americans..........why????? Ya know.....they're Russians....they can't be.  Very dissapointing movie.  If i had seen it before i read the book.......I probably would of never wanted to read the book.

208,jk61843,Garbage,3,30 July 2011,"The only reason I watched this POS ""P(iece)O(f)S(hit)"" was to uncover some questions to my intrigue from the first film. I think 2001 was one of the greatest films I have ever seen. To be honest for every reason I love 2001, I hate 2010. In 2010 realism is completely lost, political overtone is prevalent thru out the movie. Logic and reason seem to have no place in the film. While 2001 strived for authenticity, 2010 seemed to completely lack any form of truth or accuracy in physics or aero astronomics. I love science. Thats why I love 2001. Even though it's science fiction they stay true to physics and the laws that govren it. One of the reasons I hate 2010 so much, it gives the first film a true diservice.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
209,digi_merchant,I will try to be objective as possible.,5,21 March 2004,"I am a very big Kubrick fan, and 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably one of my top ten favorite pictures. I really enjoy ""higher"" themes of the 2001, and I find the lack of them in 2010 to be quite troublesome. I can help asking why 2001 was not enough. Why start out with a majestic, cinematic masterpiece and then follow it up with a genre film?Although I sometimes wish the 2010 were never made, I watched it again again today, the widescreen DVD :), with the intention of giving it a review here on IMDb.Alright, first of all this film should probably be seen as more of an interpretation of Clarke and not Kubrick; to be fair I will try not to compare 2001 and 2010 too much (even though I much prefer 2001).2010 has interesting use of light throughout the whole picture. There are many scenes with Shneider being covered in almost complete shadow. Some may call this poor lighting, but it appears intended, and it contrasts with other very well lit scenes quite nicely. Many of the visuals are quite magnificent too. I thought Jupiter looked stunning. Peter Hyams training in painting is constantly made apparent in the picture.I liked the non-original music (all of which appeared in 2001), but the original stuff I did not like, it sounds quite dated and not well planned, I think better scores were being written at the time with synthesizers (Bladerunner). Old synths do not necessarily sound dated, and can often sound better than newer synths, but this soundtrack hurt the quality of the over-all film.Arthur C. Clarke's involvement and influence is definitely here. The man is may not be known for character development, but he is known for technical accuracy. This can be seen in the pragmatic design of the Leonov, the explanation for HAL's malfunction, the method used to slow down the Leonov using Jupiter's gravity, et cetera. Clarke's writing is of the old school of science fiction, along with Heinlein and Asimov, where the concepts and gadgets drive the plot, not the characters. In this respect, this plays very well as Clarke adaptation on screen.I must question some of the casting the casting of Roy Shneider as Dr. Heywood Floyd. Schneider is much too reactionary in his performance and does not create a believable portrayal of the character.I will admit that Keir Duella and Douglas Rain both help to maintain some continuity between Kubrick and Hyams. The actors playing Soviet crew member all did well too.Overall I am quite conflicted. I think it is good for a science fiction genre film, and often a breath of fresh air when one gets tired of lack of technical accuracy in Star Wars and the like. My demand for films do deal with the ""big"" questions (the way 2001 does) trumps 2010's adherence to Clarke standards though.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
210,olivercobb,"""2010"" is the all important blank filler, that leaves far less to the imagination than Stanley Kubrick's ""2001-A Space Odyssey""",8,6 August 2012,"What is important to understand about this movie, is that there shouldn't be any comparison with Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" from 1968. While ""A Space Odyssey"" stands out as a masterpiece in film history, ""2010"" acts more as the film that reveals the information people were desperate to know; this wasn't clear in Kubrick's creation 16 years earlier. The film is about a crew of American, and Russian Astronauts who team up, on the brink of war on Earth, to shed some light on the mystery as to what happened to the Discovery space craft, and the malfunctioned HAL 9000 on board computer. The American crew captain, Heywood Floyd, is the centre character in this film, and acts as the ever inquisitive audience with the questions that need answering. ""2010"" utilises impressive visuals, and a more character personal story- line than ""2001"", which provides SOME missing information regarding the Monolith, and David Bowman's miraculous departure from the Discovery Jupiter mission nine years earlier. However, some questions remain unanswered: Where is David now? How is he making communication with the Discovery rescue crew? What is so special about Jupiter's moon Europa? Despite the re-appearance of David and the Star-Child, the audience still feels a bit left in the dark. And some things in this movie seem rather anti-climactic, or lust plain bizarre(for instance the computer based communication between the intelligence on Europa, and Earth, and the space crew), but don't let this sway you, the ending is quite pleasing. I'd recommend ""2010"" to anyone, any day, with the warning that it is important to see ""2001_ A Space Odyssey"" and not make direct comparisons. It is a fun, definitely 'Eighties' film that provides the viewer an afternoon of entertainment. A part of me was a bit disappointed that the mystery of ""2001"" was revealed so simply; I felt that the mysteriousness of the franchise was what made it so likable. But this film is good, therefore it is well worth seeing.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
211,jphansen,Religious propaganda meets pseudo-science,5,20 April 2004,"The movie begins with the main character traveling to Jupiter in what he says will be a 2 ½ year round trip.  This means each way will be 15 months, and I calculated that the spaceship would have to travel at a speed of roughly 58,000 km per hour to reach Jupiter in 15 months.  This seemed highly unlikely to me that a spacecraft could travel that fast, especially one as massive as was shown in the movie.  Their final destination is to the old ship orbiting IO, and to get there, they use Jupiter's gravity to slingshot them around to the other side of the planet where IO is located. This part was totally absurd to me, because when they were being flung around Jupiter, the ship was actually flying through the atmosphere of Jupiter, and if they were that close, it would suck the ship in and crush it.  I suppose I would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen 2001, but it relies mostly on special effects and mystical notions, unlike the first movie that was more of a psychological thriller.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
212,am-gnothiseuton,"Extension of 2001 story, not ideas!",7,7 August 2012,"Only bad thing about this movie is that it is a squeal of 2001, but not made by Kubriek. However, Arthur C Clarke extends the story of 2001 into 2010 in a very smooth and intelligent manner. I understand that this movie had an exceptional onus because of 2001, but I strongly feel that it is highly under-rated.Anyway, I'm glad no movie is made on 2051 and 3001. If selective memory deletion is ever invented, I know what is the first thing I will do.2001 was an end in itself and was a stand alone movie. Just like Matrix can stand alone without its squeals. So it wasn't really necessary to tell the story any further. 2001 left much for speculations and interpretations. However, 2010 not only clearly answers those questions, but in a way completes the story of 2010. It is similar to Star Wars prequels explaining the Force or the Architect/Oracle explaining Matrix in Matrix sequels and sort of spoiling the mystery which we wanted to continue. But thankfully, its not as bad as the examples I gave.While 2001 is completely out of the world experience, 2010 is a pop-corn flick with decent extension of the story of 2001. But this is what all the difference is. 2001 was less of a story and more of a maze of ground breaking ideas - scientific as well as philosophical. 2010 extends only the story of 2001 and do nothing unique in terms of generating newer ideas.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

The comments I saw for a review saying it was boring as the original (first one) and ...""uninvolving""? This movie blew me away, I really thought it was great. This is NOT an action movie and for that matter neither was ""2001"". If you're looking for a fast paced and, well.. shallow movie this isn't that either. You thinkers, this movie is for you. The acting is wonderful and special effects are very convincing and not diverting. The story is very interesting although it certainly dates it more than special effects. I can probably name about 120 sci-fi movies that aren't as enjoyable to me as 2010 and most of those are still more than worth seeing.

214,holothete,A Ho-Hum Follow-Up to a Brilliant Predecessor,6,22 February 2015,"Many have written that it is unfair to compare this film with Kubrick's 1968 film, but as both are ostensibly part of the same franchise, there is no running away from such comparisons, and Peter Hyams's effort comes up short in in some noticeable ways. 2001, the older film, manages to be beautiful, majestic, and timeless; 2010, by comparison, already seems quaint and dated, despite having special effects decades more advanced. One of my pet peeves, sound effects in space, has crept back into use. Kubrick thankfully never made this blunder, and what wondrous dramatic use he made of the absolute silence of space! The choice of accompanying music is generic Hollywood fare, so unlike Kubrick's clever classical selections. The plot is another impediment; it is more banal and limited in scope, giving the film more the feel of a conventional thriller movie, especially at the end, which has a contrived feel. That is not to say that this is a dreadful movie; there are a couple of decent performances, such as those of Roy Scheider and a very young Yelena Mirren. Being bilingual would definitely help the viewer, too, as a lot of the abundant dialogue is in Russian and there are no subtitles. In summary, how much you enjoy this film will depend on how much you demand of it--just take care not to demand too much.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
215,JohnnyNospam,Cheesy Continuation of 2001,3,31 December 2005,"2001 was thought provoking at the very least and mind blowing for most fans I know. On the other hand, 2010 is a simple & mind numbing caricature of the melodramatic ""why can't we all just get along"" mentality that oversimplified cold war differences in the 1980's.As a continuation of the original plot this will satisfy people who were uncomfortable with the ambiguity and mystery of 2001, but people who appreciate that not all works of art should be tied up neatly and outlined in black will want to vomit at the outcome of 2010.Visually, 2010 has some nice effects, but it contains many scenes that give it a low budget TV sci-fi flick feel.Overall I believe the largest problem with this story (both book & movie) is that it cheapens the original (and that goes for the other novels through 3001). 2001 was great in that it left the reader with a sense of awe and wonder. Clarke's attempts to tie up the loose ends of 2001 serve to deflate that affect and by the end of 3001 I felt as though the previous books were very long and overly complex if this simple sci-fi story was what Clarke envisioned from the outset of 2001.The original 2001 was a work of brilliance that should have been left to stand alone, unanswered except for what it inspired in the imagination of audiences and readers, but market forces will usually prevail in these types of matters I suppose.",2010 - The Year We Make Contact

Then you should have known about HAL's multifunction & the mystery question in dark space.The shinning point in 2010 is that HAL finished its great turning, from a murder suspect to another role.Reasonably, the special effect seems ordinary in this film.

It's so widely different from every other movie in existence. It raises so many questions and theories. And then here comes this garbage. This is one of the low points of humanity.

218,jils-27727,Not what you think,9,29 July 2019,"2001: ASO and its sequel 2010: TYWMC are not what people think they are about, mainly the evolution of mankind. Revisit 2001 and pay particular notice to actual spacial orientation and perspective (e.g. notice the opening shot of dawn on earth; the sun does not rise over the north pole in reality but in this obscure shot it only seems like it does...in error!). This was a very deep yet simple layer of the film which if you look closely enough Kubrick, the genius that he us, keeps purposefully cryptic and obscured. Notice that 2010 was not directed by him (he was long gone by the time this movie came out) but this time Arthur C. Clarke played a significant role in developing and writing 2010. Because so many people interpret these films as being strongly linked to the physical and mental evolution of human-kind, Clarke, not wanting to disappoint and continued developing 2010 along the same vein. More than likely, we would've gotten a much different 2010 if Kubrick were involved in its direction and production. However, I strongly believe that because of the deeper layers of the first film, 2001, Kubrick would've probably felt that a sequel was totally unnecessary. Think about it for a minute: 2001 came out in 1968. If there was any compulsion of Kubrick to put out a sequel to this movie, don't you think he would've done it way sooner than when 2010 came, while he was still alive?",2010 - The Year We Make Contact
