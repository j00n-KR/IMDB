0,TheLittleSongbird,"Rich in cheese, poor in charm",3,8 January 2019,"Will never tire of Christmas, it is always been special to me and my favourite time of year and always will be. It is not just all the fond memories of being with family and doing the usual festive traditions but also the atmosphere of it all, it is just wonderful reliving the charm and nostalgia every year.There was one main reason for watching 'Christmas Inheritance'. That being wanting to see more festive films, and ones different to the ones familiar with, adored and watched every year. Sadly, although 'Christmas Inheritance' is not one of the worst festive films seen it is really quite weak, even when taking it for what it was and trying to be (really did try honestly) it ended up feeling like a typical cheesy comedy romance with a few but not many merits. Despite how that sounds, that is not meant to imply that there is a personal bias against this type of film, there are some good to great ones out there. They do however have traps, and they are all fallen into here.Good things there are but they are overshadowed by how much wrong there is with the film. There is a real festive charm to how 'Christmas Inheritance' looks, it's beautifully shot and the locations are even lovelier. This festive charm can be heard aurally too, with an infectiously catchy soundtrack that does get one into the Christmas spirit.Most of the actors, more the support than the leads, do their best too, they at least try and don't look bored or go too histrionic. With such wanting material, that is a miracle.Unfortunately, 'Christmas Inheritance' falls well short on all its genre elements. The romance suffers from a complete lack of chemistry between the leads and from being completely bland, with especially cheesy dialogue that doesn't flow and a rather impossible to root for protagonist. Neither of the leads came over as believable to me, the main character has no charm or likeability and the male lead overdoes the goofiness, it's hard to see what the characters see in each other. The comedy throughout felt forced and limply timed and over-sentimentality and gone-off cheese are far from kept at bay, the film is practically covered in it and at its worst it is hard to stomach. None of the cliched characters are interesting and are instead annoying, any attempts at development for the main character is so rushed and her change is not believable at all when she is so difficult to endear to for most of the film.Only fleetingly, and even those fleeting moments are pretty small, does 'Christmas Inheritance' have any degree of charm or heart. It then is further hurt by everything being easily foreseeable long before it happens due to being done so many times before. Then going so over-the-top straining credibility, with far too many glaring story lapses, that it becomes increasingly far-fetched before being completely unrealistic. The direction is routine at best.All in all, weak, very cheesy and totally charmless and unengaging. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Christmas Inheritance
1,Prismark10,Small town girl,3,23 December 2017,"Ellen Langford (Eliza Taylor) is a rich party girl who creates salacious newspaper headlines. Her father has had enough. To prove to him she is fit to inherit the family business, she is sent on a bus with $100 to deliver and a special Christmas letter to her dad's former partner in the small town of Snow Falls which has no mobile phone signal. Ellen cannot tell anyone who she really is.Her suitcase is run over by the local cabbie and innkeeper Jake Collins (Jake Lacy) who once spent some time in New York but he did not like the big city life. Ellen is stranded in the town during a snowstorm. She works in the inn to make some money, learns how to bake with the help of Jake's aunt. Ellen after spending some time in Snow Falls has a different outlook in life and falls for Jake despite being engaged.Although made by Netflix this is not too far removed from the Hallmark Christmas cookie cutter formula. Ellen and Jake give appealing performances but it all too syrupy. A sugar laced romance with the subtext of you have to go to a small town to find the true meaning of life.",Christmas Inheritance
2,phd_travel,Totally unnecessary movie,2,13 January 2018,"There are some Christmas movies that you ask why did they bother to make another one? This one just has nothing new to say. Waiting for something different to happen or something to distinguish it from the others but nothing came.
A rich girl goes incognito in a small town and doesn't really learn too much of a lesson. The romance is unconvincing. I didn't care whether they ended up together or not. The pseudo drama was silly - why should he care so much about her not wanting to flaunt her wealth.Nice to watch Andie MacDowell in anything. She has aged gracefully and I think she sings a bit too.",Christmas Inheritance
3,lisafordeay,Enjoyable film,6,15 November 2020,"Christmas Inheritence is a 2017 romantic comedy starring Eliza Taylor and Andie McDowell.
An it girl travels to a local town to give her father's friend a bunch of letters. From there she meets a handsome guy( even though she is already engaged to a tight businessman) and learns more on herself as a normal person and not some sort of party person.
Will Snow Falls discover the young girl's real identity.If you love Leap Year then you'll probably like this film",Christmas Inheritance

5,bettycjung,Never too late to learn about your past,4,11 June 2018,"6/6/18. A light romance movie in which a rich woman learns what it's like to be in love with what really counts. Her father sends her back to the town he grew up in so she can learn more about her roots. She develops an appreciation for people who are not as blessed as she is and an awareness of just how superficial her fiance really is. Good thing, right?",Christmas Inheritance
6,Marynewcomb2013,Hallmark it is NOT!!,1,10 November 2018,"This movie tries to be like Hallmark movies and misses the mark!! Hallmark movies have a formula to them that includes heart!! They have the movies wrote to fit the cast, not just take cast members off the streets!! Something else that makes Hallmark movies work, no PC!!! This movie is full of PC like Netflix does!! Example of the PC in this movie, The guy dressed as Santa!! People all over the world know what Santa looks like & it's not what's in this movie!!! They say the age range for this on Netflix is 11-12 year olds!! If you want kids minds shaped to the views of this, I'm offended society, then let them watch. If you want to teach kids right from wrong, then don't let them watch this garbage!! Here is a bit of fact info for you, Netflix is losing subscribers on a daily basis because of the majority of their original content!!!",Christmas Inheritance
7,spasek,A Christmas Movie That Caves At the Very End Thanks To Gutless Writers!,6,19 August 2021,"As many reviewers have already stated, this film has a lot of cliches; plot devices that Hallmark has used relentlessly for many years now. Someone must have snuck into the Hallmark offices and stolen the template.All in all, despite the cliches and rather predictable story, it works...until the very end, that is. I'd hoped that the writers might have had some guts; might have chosen the road less traveled, but alas, it wasn't to be.Ellen Langford, the heiress of a multi-million dollar company is sent to the small town of Snow Falls incognito where her parents are from with the hopes that she might learn some things and glean some values that the blue collar folks sometimes have. Using a fake name, she's sent with only $100 and no credit cards. She quickly learns that most people have to actually earn their way in life rather than have things given to them.Of course, Ellen meets the strapping, handsome Jake Collins. Of course, as you can easily predict, their intial meetings are tenuous at best. Jake is a helpful guy who's pretty much beloved around town. And Ellen begins to notice and finds herself attracted to him. However, after being dropped by his ex-wife--a high-finance executive--Jake has little reason to go through a repeat.Another ""of course"" is that Ellen has a fiance who's just like she was: money talks, and she soon finds that she no longer has anything in common with him. Predictably, she breaks it off with him.Yet another ""of course,"" Jake inevitably finds out the truth about Ellen and who she is, which understandably upsets him, which brings to the 11th hour of the film (the last ten minutes) where everything is magically resolved. Ellen finds out that her father and uncle concocted the ""trial"" and she inherits the company after all with Jake jumping on board without even the smallest of objections. Does this sound like something Jake would do? Or even Ellen?Had the writers had any guts, and really known their characters, they would've realized that Jake would never have given over so easily. Perhaps not even at all. Do you see Jake packing up and heading off to New York again? I don't. And given what she found in Snow Falls, I just don't see her accepting the CEO job. If she'd really changed, she would have stepped down and realized that she'd never been so happy in her life until she went to Snow Falls. She'd scarcely decide to return to a life that had only made her miserable.What is sad is that this movie is actually very enjoyable--despite its cliches and predictability--and has solid performances throughout. But a movie built on toothpicks cannot stand. And this one crumbles badly because of that. There's nothing so sad as wasted potential.",Christmas Inheritance
8,LukeCustomer2,People have insisted this was good...,3,1 December 2019,"It was not. This is basic moviemaking at its worst. I think someone in their basement could have made this movie. It is very basic. It starts with a very questionable premise... that it is a disaster that the daughter of a CEO should do some cartwheels at an event to raise money for charity. She wasn't drunk, she wasn't, needlessly showing of racy underwear. But this puts her in hot water. To get her out of it her dad tasks her with going to a small town to deliver letters to this person that was 1/2 responsible for the business. Huh? Honestly I have no idea what this is about. To do this she must change her name so no one knows who she is and she must only do it on $100. This woman is apparently so daft she thinks the will have a flight attendant on a bus. When she arrives in the town the person she is there to see isn't there... so she must stay a few days. This is where things get weird for me. She runs into Jake Lacy who is... of course, the only male in the down under 40 and instantly this movie starts shipping them hard without a bit of chemistry. In fact Jake's character comes off a bit abusive because all he does the entire time is try to make her actions out to be a problem. Jake is everyplace like a creepy grumpy stalker. She screams in her room, he is there... she needs food, he is there to tell her they don't have room service. Every single person in town assumes they are dating though, she has only been there 1 day and has a fiancé. Jake talks down to her at every turn. You have met this guy in real life.. he is attracted to you but has to treat you bad so he can save his ego. Here, her being from New York (the place that ruined him) is a threat to his ego but Eliza Taylor is such a babe he wants to be with her anyway, though he doesn't like anything about her. When it all comes out that she has money everyone is mad at her. Blurg... really? Whoever wrote this really needs to seek therapy for their mixed up view of the world. But you don't have to watch fever dream.",Christmas Inheritance
9,the_doofy,NOT a comedy,6,20 April 2019,"It's a drama with a couple of funny elements. The only thing really funny was the bus driver and the luggage.Acting was fine, despite how some of the reviews have type cast the main actorsI enjoy watching hall mark style movies from time to time. Nice to get away from rancid language, drugs, pot, violence, sex for a changeThis movie does one thing that is different, in every Christmas movie I have seen the antagonist character is caucasian male (more acting jobs for that demographic), THIS christmas movie was not on that PC band wagon.",Christmas Inheritance
10,hjalsayegh,A Hallmark Movie. Tardis edition!,3,29 November 2018,"Rich party girl from the city is sent to a small one horse town to learn the true meaning of Christmas.
Not only is 90% of the dialogue an exhibition dump but the movie bends over backwards to take the character back in time to the late 70's early 80's. Because clearly the only way to learn the true spirit of Christmas is through time travel. Things were better in my day before uber and cell phones. we had landlines and everybody knew everybody. Women would come up to you with a plate of freshly baked cookies randomly and nobody had seen let alone carried changed for a $100 note!
Even for a fluff piece, this is bad and shallow. Skip it and watch an actually good Christmas movie.",Christmas Inheritance

Typical story, city girl with fiance goes to country town for Christmas, learns the value of community, leaves the current fiance and runs off with local boy. who is damaged by the fact that his own fiance did exactly the same thing to him. Despite this, tries to kiss an engaged woman.
Trouble is she is already engaged and dumps him for some guy she has known for 2 days, the new relationship is doomed, she CEO in the city, he will never leave his town again.

16,aranormer,Poor.,2,14 November 2019,"I was expecting a cheesy feel-good flick with loads of sugar and kisses. What I got was a script that kept contradicting itself from scene to scene, completely wooden and uninteresting characters and a basic story that conveyed rather strange if not downright disgusting message.Selfish nitwit heiress wasn't in the movie, her character was little clumsy but good at heart from the start.Inn keeper was having inapropriate mood swings. I kept waiting for him to confess that he ended his ex with an axe.""Greedy and selfish"" fiancee was actually the voice of reason, yet we're supposed to hate him for reasons.Clearly unstable inn keeper with equally dubious townsfolk who are all depending on the company (how exactly? Where were the factories/craft shops?) are supposed to be the heroes who teach to heiress... Teach her what?Killer blizzard consists on few lazily floating specles of  snow. We later learn that said storm has truly wrecked havoc and made in to national news. Yet in town life goes on, and amount of snow on-screen is less than what I could scrape off from my freezer. Coldness that's frequently advertized by various characters doesn't show on-screen either.Did I already mention dangerously unhinged inn keeper, and how we are supposed to root for him instead of surprisingly reasonable fiancee because reasons?",Christmas Inheritance
17,onurwskix-52889,Annoying,1,10 January 2021,"This movie is one of the most annoying films I have ever watched - it goes beyond the point of cringe.I can't remember the last time I disliked every single character in a film. Everything from the storyline, to the acting is simply unamphatheticle.You feel bad for the incredibly rich and privalaged girl... no no you don't, I won't give it away because I am not allowed to do spoilers but - at no point in the film did I feel any amphathy for anyone.",Christmas Inheritance

19,kellyjeanne-66859,Sweet,6,1 December 2020,"Yes it is a ""typical Christmas movie"". But so what? There is always a little special touch of a Christmas message in these movies. In this movie, it is when Livvy gives the Christmas Teddy Bear to Ellie after she finds Ellie crying. That's what Christmas is all about, kindness to others.",Christmas Inheritance
20,asmithee23,Better actors elevate the story.,8,27 January 2021,"It's a typical, improbable, kind of cheesy but a good hearted Christmas movie but the quality of the performances lifts it up. Like most tv Christmas movies, every setting is over decorated but the lights are pretty and the trees look like the crew really took their time on decorating them as opposed to the usual hastily put up and container of Target ornaments tossed on. The family Inn is really beautiful and so makes you want to visit for a stay. While the heroine is spoiled and out of touch, she's kind and has the best intentions so it's easy to root for her as she learns to appreciate the locals which includes Jim 2.0 er, Jake Lacy who is quite solid himself. For me, it only falters in the final dance scene. Something just seems off about it. It has the expected outcome but the singer chosen to sing wasn't that good and having Andie MacDowell also sing was a mistake. She seemed uncomfortable. Overall, though, Eliza Taylor is really good and Lacy and MacDowell were solid as well. This is now in my Christmas movie rotation.",Christmas Inheritance
21,aimtrain1021,"Good idea, poorly executed",2,21 November 2020,"I am all for cheesy holiday movies. I like some of these Netflix originals and others are just too cringe. This one was cringe. There is no consistency with quality of Netflix movies/shows, so it's always a surprise to see what you'll get. I liked Operation Christmas Drop and Dash & Lily was cute, but this one was a fail.The spoiled rich girl was not rude or obnoxious at all, so there was no real change or character development. I like Eliza on The 100, but this just didn't work for her.And I was so distracted by Jake's hair. Awful! That side part was ridiculous. I am all for the dorky hometown guy getting the girl, but fix the hair! It didn't suit him at all.The pacing was slow, but it all took place over a couple days. It was just an overall weird dynamic the entire time and made it boring.",Christmas Inheritance
22,hugomerckx,"Great CHRISTMAS movie, don't expect an Oscar worthy picture, it's a Christmas movie, with all the cliché's, and it knows that.",8,1 January 2019,"This is a great Christmas movie to watch with your whole family. It has the cliché's of a Christmas movie, and it' s very cheasy sometimes, like you expect and want from a family Christmas movie.The story is predictable, but enjoyable, and you can just watch without thinking about anything.
The acting is good, nothing outstanding, Eliza Taylor did great in my opinion, it's nice to see her in a whole different genre than the 100. The rest of the cast is good to.I don't really understand the 5.7 rating here on IMDB. What did everyone expect when they watched this movie? It's exactly what I expected it to be, and that's why I watched it. If this isn't your thing, don't watch it. You know what to expect when you watch a movie like this.So if you wanted to watch this movie because you wanted a cheasy family Christmas movie, watch it. Don't let the bad reviews stop you from doing so. They're ridiculous in my opinion.",Christmas Inheritance

24,Lanting,Trivia,8,11 December 2019,"Quite a few similarities exist between this movie and 1983's Groundhog Day.Andie MacDowell was in both movies as a supporting character.
The title character has a lesson to learn before they can continue their life.
The protagonists start out expecting everyone to cater to them.
The moderate sized town only has one diner.
The main characters can't move on with their lives until they understand how other people deal with everyday life.
A snow storm strands everyone and closes all the roads.
Ice sculptures are created by the local talent.
A short snowball fight breaks out during a nighttime stroll.
A pivotal point of the movie revolves around an auction at the end.",Christmas Inheritance

After reading all the dissing reviews my expectations weren't high, but somehow all of it surprised me. Pretty good acting, great to see Eliza Taylor again, and all the cliché elements were there, including the plot holes.

31,katshapiro,Pain,1,21 December 2017,"I went into this hoping for some cotton-candy brain cleanser after a long day at work. Which means my expectations were already nearing rock bottom. And yet still, somehow, I'm disappointed.First off, actors Eliza Taylor, Neil Crone, and Michael Xavier all did a good job. And that's the only positive thing I can say here. Because the plot is that a rich girl cheats on her loving fiance with a grown-up toddler in overalls, whose deeply unimpressive hobbies involve drawing 3rd grade level pictures of Santa Claus and punching jukeboxes. Her fiance, meanwhile, takes this all with a surprisingly level head, even when she unceremoniously dumps him on Christmas eve. The take-away is that baking cookies is better for the soul than having wealth and being an adult, which is sufficiently Christmas-y, but still a complete dumpster fire of a movie. Enjoy it after a few too many eggnogs, or better yet, don't.",Christmas Inheritance

35,tonybedford,Corny but...,6,13 November 2019,"There are many failings of this move. The character development is shallow, the action is lacklustre, the plot is fairly unbelievable, and yet this movie has a certain charm to it. I think the heroine is quite charming, and one can not help but notice her ""voluptuous curves"" which are front and centre in many scenes. If you've got it flaunt it I say...So with so many failings what gives this movie its charm? I think it is the sets and the lighting which I thought were very atmospheric. The charming Cafe, the wonderful guest house, the snowy streets were all very evocative of Christmas time.It was a pleasure to see Andie MacDowell - I'd not seen her in anything since Four Weddings and a Funeral and that was a looonngg time ago.

36,carrona,Poor Choice of 'Hunk' With a Heart.,3,19 December 2017,"Don't get me wrong. In many ways this movie ticks all the boxes when it comes to formulaic cheesiness. Is there an attractive, secretly wealthy boy/ or girl who's working undercover (to learn about themselves and/or learn how to take over the family's company or kingdom as part of an inheritance and/or experience the real world)? Yes!Does the action take place in a small, wholesome, cosy little town and/or palace in some East European-ovia country? Yes!Is the object of their attraction a pretty or handsome-yet-ordinary person with a heart of gold? Yes! Is one of them due to get married to/in a relationship with, someone they don't really love? Yes! Is there a late-in-the-day 'misunderstanding' between the romantic leads - which has to be resolved before they finally realize they're meant for each other? Yup.All's well and good in this movie, except for one thing. I'm sure the male lead is a lovely person in real life but he's mis-cast. For these type of movies to work, BOTH leads need to be attractive. Even attractive and quirky is okay.The girl is beautiful and adorable. Too bad the male lead in ""Christmas Inheritance"" ain't no HUNK. He's just downright goofy looking.......and not in a unconventional, fanciable way.For that reason alone, sadly it's a FAIL from me!",Christmas Inheritance

They're simple, and provide something nice and festive in the background when I'm working on projects. This movie though... it's okay at best. It starts out with a fun concept and the chemistry is great at first. But I can't shake the feeling that the whole movie feels like 'countryside' propaganda. Small towns being cute, charitable, and nice where everyone gets along and no one ever fights. Seems a little too perfect, if you know what I mean? Though, I will note that if you watch this on Netflix, there is a Japanese dub. It makes it a bit more bearable.",Christmas Inheritance

49,kassiacrislayne,Nice one,8,17 December 2017,This movie has Ellie learning to be better by spending some time in her parents' little town. It was nice and worth watching. Eliza Taylor is always a treat to watch and I hope to see her in more works.,Christmas Inheritance
50,jimmyorlando-68027,Good acting but bad choice of actors.,4,24 December 2017,"The whole idea of sending a bitch who only cares about money and parties to a small town to learn about the true values of Christmas and being a nice person is great. 1. But the lead female character is not a bitch, doesn't look like a bitch. 
2. The lead male character is a bit too goofy and dorky. 
3. The pace of the movie is way too fast to make the script believable. The ""brat"" turns into a good girl WAY TOO FAST. It only takes 2 days......REALLY???!?!?A lot of plot holes.
1. cellphones don't work because it is supposed to be a small town..... but that have an Apple Store......
2. Lead female character is stuck in the town because of winter storm......no storm do we see..... Only a couple of centimeters snow. If that is supposed to be a major snowstorm....
3. Main characters are about to kiss......Does the lead female character hates her fiancee so much? It didn't look like it at the beginning of the movie though. In other words, unbelievable romance between bitch and goofy guy
4. Fiancee is supposed to be a jerk.....He is not. He drives through a "" snow storm"" to this small town to pick her up to go on a well deserved vacation. How can this guy be an asshole. He should be the one dumping HER IN THE END. 
5. Snow all around but lead female character keeps walking on very high heels all the time. No one does that. 
6. Goofy male main character reacts too angry when he finds out who the new girl really is. No one does that. And if you do, you will definitely stay single. I can go on for hours this way. To many plot holes. Too bad. But since I wanted to watch a Christmas movie and this is a Christmas movie in the end, I grand this movie a 4",Christmas Inheritance
51,merickson-63010,Stereotypical,2,24 November 2018,"Yikes! What a mess of a movie. Jake is the most judgmental person, and it's so off-putting, it's hard to believe anyone can fall for him. From their very first meeting at the bus stop, he was aggressive toward her. Also, living in a small town myself, I can guarantee if cell service was as awful as they portray, the town would be so abandoned, even 1 taxi wouldn't get business. Living in a city isn't always a bad thing, living in a small town isn't always preferrable, being rich doesn't always mean you're out of touch and need a lesson, and being from a small town doesn't mean you're all about community, etc. This stereotypical format is ridiculously overdone. Don't be boring as a writer! Be creative! I give it 2 stars because I like Andie McDowell.",Christmas Inheritance
52,shahdqutifan,Get over it.,7,15 November 2019,"It's a Christmas movie. I don't understand why people are taking it too seriously. It's sappy and snowy and predictable, defiantly not masterpiece material, but still a cozy romantic movie to watch during the holidays. I'd defiantly recommend it if, you're looking for that kind of warm movie.",Christmas Inheritance
53,neenamariemiller,Just watch and enjoy.,10,27 December 2019,"Loved the movie. It is what Christmas is really all about, helping others, sharing, caring. The movie was fun and fast moving. Just watch and enjoy.",Christmas Inheritance
54,bridget-mountford,Nice,10,4 November 2018,Was really good except for intense sex scene between ellie's dad and his secretary that comes out of nowhere!,Christmas Inheritance
55,scottsanguinito,Bad Writing...Good Scenery,6,7 December 2020,"I watched Christmas Inheritance last year. It had Plop from the Office I enjoy a hallmark movie ever now and then...But...There was one scene where a huge freeze storm was coming and the bed and breakfast took in a bunch of straded tourists and such...So Plop goes out to get firewood from the porch....the main chick remembers a homeless man she saw in town, so she sneaks out to go get him...walking past Plop without him seeing...The next scene he comes in with like 4 logs of wood and asks where she is....everyone looks around and can't fine her Then she walks in with the homeless guy This mother f ing chick braved a God damn winter storm to walk miles into town and back...all in the same amount if time it took to get 4 logs from a porch",Christmas Inheritance
56,ram-rahimi,Childish with a lot of plotholes and too predictable,1,27 December 2019,This is a movie for kids not adults with a lot of plotholes and too predictable,Christmas Inheritance
57,victoriafruensgaard,Nice break,9,12 November 2019,"The movie ""Christmas Inheritance"" is a great movie if you need a break and you just can realx and come in the christmas spirit. It's a cute movie, it's pretty predictable - but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.",Christmas Inheritance
58,eionobryant,Great Movie,10,18 December 2017,Christmas Inheritance was a very good movie! It would be a great family movie and would teach the kids something about Christmas. I love Eliza Taylor,Christmas Inheritance
59,qmaddie,This contains spoilers; I want your view,6,22 December 2017,Why did Ellie still like that small town boy after he was so hateful to her when he learned who she was? I otherwise sheepishly enjoyed this very bad Christmas movie.,Christmas Inheritance
60,gsn-06186,Fantastic movie,10,22 December 2017,I have seen Taylor in the show (The 100) I like her acting. She has done a great work in this movie too. I would like to see her in more shows like these.,Christmas Inheritance
61,sihammarte,The romance was subtle & the story was well written,10,27 December 2017,"The story was well written.
Of course it was low budget. However, the ending was magical. And really well put together. This movie didn't end like every other Christmas romcom, Regardless, have low expectations as one would do with a typical low budget film. I was kinda impressed",Christmas Inheritance
62,iambrittanychristian,"Good Start, Horrible Finish",1,5 January 2018,"I love a good old movie full of cheesy moments, and that's exactly what I was looking for in this.But, in my opinion, this movie is what is wrong with our society. Let me explain...*Spoiler Alert*First off, this woman was willing to vault a toy train in a dress at a freaking gala in order for a guy to quadruple a man's donation. And she's scolded for it and her morals are questioned because of it??? Are you freaking kidding me??? Gtfo. If I vault anything in a dress to quadruple a freaking donation, someone better be THANKING me, if anything. But if that's all there was, there wouldn't have been much of a plot so....Cue the trip to the small town. She's dating this a**hole of a guy. Extremely gorgeous, but a complete a**. He has to stay home because...reasons. She must go to this small town alone to learn a lesson about appreciating what truly matters in life. She meets an amazing guy who is tremendously sweet and kind-hearted. He shows her around town and treats her wonderfully. She begins to do nice things for him as well and starts to truly warm up to the town. You can tell she's starting to catch feelings, but wants to remain loyal to her fiancée.She's here under the guise of a different name, (Elle London, instead of Ellen Langford) so that she doesn't get special treatment for being an heiress. Makes sense. Her dad wants her to learn a lesson. But when this so-called knockoff 'prince charming' finds out that she has an extra letter at the end of her first name and is really the daughter of the owner of a huge toy business, he freaks out and throws a b*tch fit. Why?? WHYY???? TELL ME SOMEONE PLZ I DO NOT UNDERSTAND???? He looks her up on the internet and sees the media coverage of her VAULTING A TRAIN AT A FREAKING GALA TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHILDREN and decides she's a liar and not the same person she's been to him--which was, btw, a really nice human being. GTFO. Here's why this is a societal issue: Think of all of the movies, TV Shows, etc. where a well-to-do or famous guy pretends to be someone he's not and then the girl either finds out he's a superstar or millionaire or whatever else. She's thrilled. Ecstatic. Should consider herself lucky to be around him. But when the genders are reversed it's not the same??? Literally, gtfo. The writer of this garbage film has to have been a guy. Because no self-respecting woman would write this trash.So he throws his b*tch fit and continues to treat her like garbage, as if nothing had ever happened and she was now dirt beneath her feet for doing something to try to make her father happy. She apologizes a few times, still...nothing. He's mad. Why? I still don't f**king know. And then, after she has her happy moment with her uncle and dad and is elected the new CEO of the company, he comes around wanting to dance. Never even an apology. All is forgiven. And she's expected to be so grateful for him forgiving her (for what, exactly???). Just like that. She moved from one a**hole to the next. How wonderful. What a wonderful little Christmas movie.",Christmas Inheritance
63,drjudkinshome,Cute,7,23 November 2018,"Cute Christmas movie, about a woman who gets ""stuck"" in a small town but discovers what is really important to her as her dad makes her stay until she delivers a special letter😊",Christmas Inheritance
64,scottandtaralee,Chloe's friend,10,8 April 2019,"The genius of this film is its ability to mask its true depth behind a mask of cheesy, traditional holiday fare, a kind of reaction to the way Citizen Kane masks its shallowness in the dressings of fake brilliance. While Orson Wells so deftly mocks the conventional tropes of so-called film noir, the gleefully awful and pretension Art Film - capital AF - Christmas Inheritance serves as its polar opposite - not in quality, mind you, but its ability to present the human condition so nakedly exposed with all its imperfections and embarrassing details. Each character in this film, though presented superficially, and yes cheesily, represents - nay, embodies - much deeper themes and constructs of humanity. The characters, the film (and everything that goes with it - the writing, directing, acting) becomes a mirror held up to mankind. The film is, in effect, us. And we are the film. We are those deeply hidden embarrassments hiding under a veneer of superficiality. We pretend we are nothing, when in fact we are gods in hiding, just as the film portrays. As Shakespeare wrote, we are what we always were, and this is especially true in this film. It is a film about Christmas, which has become - at least in our western culture (now crumbling at its edges, and, to speak bluntly, its very core) a mockery of its true meaning. We see in our western version of Christmas what we see in ourselves: an abandonment of all things real and deeply personal, even painful (see Huxley) for the superficial, the vapid, the easy and pleasant. We've abandoned the reality of suffering for the latex falseness of modern life, leaving all meaning and true human experience behind and replacing it with an amusement park. This is the true genius of this film.",Christmas Inheritance
65,bennington-26958,Very cute,5,10 October 2019,"I enjoyed it,. It's sweet just like a Christmas movie should be.",Christmas Inheritance
66,thethbunny,Wonderful Movie! Definitely a must watch!,10,19 October 2018,"I loved this movie from beginning to end. I wasn't expecting to like it so much but it was incredibly sweet, the actors were easy to like and the plot was simple but nonetheless charming. It's a good Christmas/Romance movie that really sets a joyous holiday mood. Gives a very ""Hallmark"" vibe but really exceeded my expectations. You should watch this movie, believe me, you're missing out.",Christmas Inheritance
67,michellekula,Don't waste your time,2,8 December 2018,As an avid Christmas movie watcher I was incredibly disappointed in this feature. Considering there are a few known names in this movie I thought it had to be half decent...WRONG. Do not waste your time. I would have rather spent my night cleaning my bathroom than the 1 hour and 44 mins of my life I can't get back from watching this movie. Perhaps I will go for a classic next time.,Christmas Inheritance
