0,TheLittleSongbird,"The plot may be total nonsense, but The Whole Nine Yards is still very entertaining",8,2 August 2010,"I actually enjoyed The Whole Nine Yards, which is more than I can say for its sequel. The plot is absolutely ridiculous, but overall the film is very entertaining and fun. The script is funny and engaging with a few quotable lines here and there, while the direction and pacing are efficient, the soundtrack excellent and the cinematography and camera angles inventive.Also adding to the enjoyment are the performances. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry nail their respective roles, both show surprisingly great comic timing, while Amanda Peet is surprisingly good as well and I found the characters likable and well written.Overall, not exceptional, but fun and entertaining. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Whole Nine Yards
1,SnoopyStyle,A mix bag but more good than not,6,10 July 2014,"Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a meek dentist in Montreal. His wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) is a money grubber who may be looking to cash in on his life insurance. His new assistant Jill St. Claire (Amanda Peet) tells him to divorce her. Then notorious mob hit-man Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves in next door. He immediately recognizes Jimmy is in danger of a contract kill from Chicago mob boss Janni Pytor Gogolak (Kevin Pollak). Sophie pushes Oz to cash in on the contract and he goes back to Chicago to appease her but not intending to contact Janni. She immediately tells Jimmy to double cross Oz. Oz is confronted by hit-man 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan) who brings him to Janni. Oz falls for femme fatale Cynthia Tudeski (Natasha Henstridge). She tells him that Janni's father Lazlo hid $10M with her before being sent to prison. It can only be accessed with three signatures from her, Janni, and Jimmy. Or else it can be accessed with their death certificates. Janni sends Frankie with Oz back to Montreal to track down and kill Jimmy. Only there are even more double crosses.My biggest problem with this is director Jonathan Lynn. He doesn't show enough comedic skills in this. There are some good potential but it looks like a second rate movie. This should be so much funnier. It's simply not well filmed. There is also the $10M jackpot. It's way too convoluted and simply a device to give the characters a reason to do what they do. It's backwards writing. Mostly, it's awkward.The good part is all the good actors around. Most of them are doing their best. Natasha Henstridge is a little stiff. Kevin Pollak isn't as funny as he needs to be. Matthew Perry is working hard and has good chemistry with Bruce Willis. The boys are good with Amanda Peet. Perry has less chemistry with Natasha Henstridge. There are a few laughs. I just wish it has a lot more.",The Whole Nine Yards
2,kosmasp,My friendly neighbor,8,26 March 2021,"You have to wonder looking at this, if Bruce Willis has been phoning it in the last couple of years. Of course the scripts he is getting are also to blame for sure. This one on the other hand really was well thought of. There still may be some issues with certain incidents and things happening here with some people watching. Like for some people Amanda Peet going naked for quite some time is a no go and others will cherish that and see humor in it. This has quite a few twists and turns and it might be fun to try to see through them. But even if you just sit back relax and let the movie do its magic, you'll be more than fine. And while Chandler, sorry Matthew Perry was riding on his Friends fame back then (well deserved I might add), Bruce Willis also was on quite some roll - and you also had Rosanne Arquette and Natasha Henstridge who also were in their prime (Hollywood career wise). It had been a while since I last saw this, but it does hold up! Which cannot be said about the sequel as much - the title by the way might not translate well for those not familiar with American Football terms - but even someone as clueless as me got the point.",The Whole Nine Yards
3,classicsoncall,"""In the old days, I would have definitely killed you.""",7,10 March 2018,"A lot of early twists and turns in the identities and motivations of the characters makes this a fun outing. Bruce Willis is equally adept at both comedy and drama, and he was a perfect casting choice as a foil for Matthew Perry's cluelessness about mob hits and his own wife's predilection for murder. When Oz's (Perry) dental assistant Jill (Amanda Peet) came out of the closet as a would be assassin in training, it added a whole new dimension to the story. Her chemistry with Willis was a whole lot better though than Perry and Natasha Henstridge as a couple. Even when it worked out at the end of the story it didn't work, if you know what I mean.I was a little disappointed with Kevin Pollack in the role of gangster Janni Gogolak, he didn't seem to exhibit any charisma for a mob boss. Pacino or De Niro might have worked better, but it looked like enough payroll was tied up with the other principals. The tip off for me that The Tulip (Willis) was going to whack Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan) instead of his new pal Oz was when Frankie shook his head and rolled his eyes when Jimmy talked him down from killing Oz on the boat ride. I got a kick out of the sight gag of the Miller Genuine Draft going over the side right after Frankie Figs did. Matthew Perry's deadpan clueless reactions can be quite hysterical.Hey, it's not high drama and that's not the reason to tune in to this flick. Willis and Perry have good chemistry, and the picture compares favorably with other assassin-comedies like ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", ""You Kill Me"" and the two ""Red's"". At just a little over an hour and a half, it won't kill you.",The Whole Nine Yards
4,gavin6942,Lots of Fun,7,12 January 2015,"Nick (Matthew Perry) is a struggling dentist in Canada. A new neighbor moves in, and he discovers that it is Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Teduski (Bruce Willis). His wife convinces him to go to Chicago and inform the mob boss who wants Jimmy dead.Bruce Willis as a hit-man? Yeah, it seems plausible given his tough guy roles. Matthew Perry as a luckless loser? Yep, makes even more sense (he definitely appeared in a series of odd romances). Together, they make a pretty good combination.While much of this is fairly predictable, it should be. This is not a deep, philosophical film about killing, but a light-hearted jaunt about contract murder and falsifying dental records. Should that be fun? Maybe not, but it is.",The Whole Nine Yards
5,jboothmillard,The Whole Nine Yards,2,4 October 2009,"I think I was only interested in this film because of members of the cast, and I recognised the title, but that's really all I can say for the reasoning. Basically miserable dentist Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Friends' Matthew Perry) meets his new neighbour, and realises it is hit-man Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), and Oz's wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) gets the mob to find Jimmy. Oz is having some people wanting to know what Jimmy is up to and making sure he is staying hidden, including his friend Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan), and he also finds out that Sophie has hired a hit-man to kill him. Alright, I will be honest, I dozed off and lost track of what was happening, but I don't think it matters too much anyway, I found it confusing anyway. Also starring Species' Natasha Henstridge as Cynthia Tudeski, Amanda Peet as Jill St. Claire, Kevin Pollak as Janni Pytor Gogolak and Dumb and Dumber's Harland Williams as Special Agent Steve Hanson. The performances are tame, the story is easy to lose track of and far fetched if you do get it, I just found it a very disappointing black comedy. Pretty poor!",The Whole Nine Yards

7,blanche-2,Won't you be my neighbor,7,2 December 2007,"A dentist discovers a notorious hit-man who testified against the mob has moved in next door to him in ""The Whole Nine Yards,"" a 2000 comedy starring Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Roseanna Arquette, Michael Clark Duncan and Natasha Henstridge. Perry is Oz, an unhappily married dentist, whose slutty, greedy wife (Arquette) decides they can grab some money if Oz goes to Chicago and turns Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tadeski (Willis) into the men who want him. Reluctantly, Oz goes. As the story continues, everybody is out to kill everybody else, Oz's wife has approached Jimmy to kill Oz, and, failing that, has found someone else to kill him; Oz's pretty dental assistant (Peet) turns out to be more than she appears; and Oz has fallen in love with Jimmy's wife, who is still in Chicago.This is a funny movie with a couple of slapsticky-laugh out loud moments provided by Perry, who is very good as a man entering an insane world that he doesn't know if he can ever escape. Willis is Willis, playing his role as a real cool guy who rarely gives away what he's thinking.The story lags a little bit - it's a good premise that with some script tightening could have been absolutely hilarious. As it is, it's fine entertainment and a great rental.",The Whole Nine Yards
8,Quinoa1984,Laughter comes in doses,6,19 June 2000,"In this movie, comedy comes in small doses, but when the dosage comes, It's pretty funny.  Bruce Willis plays a hitman who moves next door to a innocent (Matthew Perry) and comedy ensues as Perry tries to make sense of his new situation.  Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan is pretty funny as a towering figure in Willis' corner.  Great cast and a funny plot make this a film to vide, but it isn't in the funniest film of the new year.

9,studioAT,Fun black comedy,5,2 January 2011,This is a film that really plays to the strengths of all the performers involved.We all know that Bruce Willis can play this sort of role with his eyes closed. Although he's killed 14 people we still like Jimmy and that is because only Willis can bring that little twinkle in the eye that makes us like Jimmy throughout the film.Matthew Perry can play a bumbling sarcastic role perfectly so there isn't anything in this film that troubles him. He gets laughs easily just by walking into things and with the raise of an eyebrow.Amanda Peet and Natasha Henstridge have both made careers out of playing the seductress or the honey trap and so are really just playing to type in this film.Overall apart from a clever twist on an old format all the cast are playing to their strengths and thankfully when they come together it makes for a fairly enjoyable film.,The Whole Nine Yards

And I enjoyed it...to some extent.  I gave it a 5 out of 10.  It's middle of the road.  Nothing really stand-out about it.  Willis is good, but nothing you'll wet your pants over.

A cast like that is worth watching painting a room, and did I mention it has Rosanna Arquette. She is worth watch painting her toenails.It is a wonderful farce with everyone trying to stab each other in the back and people who just aren't who they appear to be.

13,grantss,Funny and entertaining mob-comedy,7,10 February 2016,"Funny and entertaining mob-comedy.Montreal, Canada. A down-on-his luck dentist, ""Oz"" Oseransky (played by Matthew Perry), discovers that his new neighbour is Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, former mob contract killer turned Police informant. The mob has put on price on the head of Tudeski (Bruce Willis). Egged on my his loathsome wife Oz sets off to Chicago to let the mob know where Tudeski is and, with a bit of luck, claim part of the reward...A movie which makes full use of Matthew Perry's prodigious comedic talents, especially for physical comedy. While Bruce Willis is solid in his role, Perry makes the movie. Very funny, and very Chandleresque. Plot is decent too, though is really just a vehicle for the comedy. Can be silly at times though, but generally doesn't get too out of hand or wander too far from the main focus. Good support from Amanda Peet (especially), Natasha Henstridge, Michael Clarke Duncan and Kevin Pollak. Roseanna Arquette is very irritating as Oz's wife, but maybe that was the idea...",The Whole Nine Yards
14,Calicodreamin,Quirky,6,2 May 2021,"A quirky contract killer comedy that kind of works. Bruce Willis is the perfect good guy/bad guy and Matthew Perry is always a good hapless dope. The storyline is unique, if not a little strange.",The Whole Nine Yards
15,Uriah43,A Surprisingly Funny Performance by Bruce Willis,6,30 November 2017,"""Oz Oseransky"" (Matthew Perry) is a dentist who lives in Montreal with his narcissistic wife ""Sophie"" (Rosanna Arquette) and his equally selfish ""Mother-in-Law"" (Carmen Ferland). Needless to say, his life is not very pleasant. As a matter of fact, about the only person who seems to understand what he's going through is his new assistant ""Jill"" (Amanda Peet) who came to work for him just three weeks ago. Then one day he notices that he has acquired a new neighbor and being a friendly person he walks over to welcome him. However, he soon realizes that his new neighbor is a notorious hit-man named ""Jimmy Tudeski"" (Bruce Willis) who has just been released from prison and has a contract out on his head for turning state's evidence against a powerful mafia don by the name of ""Janni Gogolak"" (Kevin Pollak). Naturally, being the mild-mannered person he is, Oz simply wants to mind his own business. Unfortunately, he makes the mistake of telling his wife who pressures him into going to Chicago in order to inform Janni Gogolak where Jimmy can be found in order to collect a finder's fee. Yet, even though he goes to Chicago, he remains firm in his decision not to meet or discuss anything with Janni Gogolak. This changes, however, when he is met by a cold-blooded hit-man named ""Frankie Figs"" (Michael Clarke Duncan) who unceremoniously convinces him to tell Janni Gogolak everything he knows. And this decision results in dangerous complications for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be a decent comedy with Bruce Willis turning in a surprisingly funny performance. Likewise, having a beautiful actress like Natasha Henstridge (as Jimmy Tudeski's wife ""Cynthia"") didn't hurt either. In any case, I enjoyed this film for the most part and have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Whole Nine Yards
16,anaconda-40658,Never Goes So Much As 1 Yard.,5,12 May 2015,"The Whole Nine Yards (2000): Dir: Jonathan Lynn / Cast: Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet: Caper comedy about the trouble we sometimes find ourselves in and the emotional endurance to figure out a solution. Matthew Perry plays a dentist who hates his marriage. Bruce Willis plays a criminal who moves in next door and refuses the witness protection program. Perry is blackmailed by his wife to expose him and reap profit. Clever concept littered with clichés. The ending uplifts criminals with humour evolving around murder. Director Jonathan Lynn previously made Sgt. Bilko but here his directing is more conventional. Willis plays Jimmy the Tulip as the ominous new neighbour who is way ahead in the con game. Perry as the depressed dentist is miserable until he becomes stranded within danger and lust. Michael Clarke Duncan plays Willis's right hand man who at first is seen as an enemy. The handling of the character in the conclusion is too conventional. Natasha Henstridge is less than effective as Willis's ex-wife. Her romance with Perry is more predictable formula than anything. Amanda Peet steals every scene she is in as Perry's dental assistant who desires to meet Jimmy. Theme regards the curious lifestyles of those living around us. It never goes the whole nine yards but the ground it does cover is a hoot at best. Score: 5 ½ / 10",The Whole Nine Yards
17,HotToastyRag,Cusp of the '90s flick,7,25 June 2019,"If you were to come up with a story of an ex-gangster trying to lay low and his nervous, spineless neighbor, you'd cast Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, at the height of his FRIENDS fame, right? The Whole Nine Yards, a classic comedy at the cusp of the 1990s, perfectly reflects the times. It's quick, intelligent, and rather tame, summing up the '90s; yet it turns the corner and gets slightly darker, weirder, and has a little more sex and nudity, representing the decade about to start.As perfect as the leads are in their roles, the supporting cast is even more memorable. Amanda Peet is bold and daring, sprinkling Tabasco sauce on her meal like it's a watering can. Rosanna Arquette and Kevin Pollak both sport hilarious accents, and Michael Clarke Duncan, as the latter's henchman, wears a great stone face so you can't tell who's side he's on. Natasha Henstridge plays Bruce's wife, and in her beautiful clothes, she's polished and classy to balance out the rest of the movie. Check out this funny, off-beat comedy to pretend you're still in the '90s!",The Whole Nine Yards
18,The_Void,Surprisingly well done suburban crime caper,7,18 June 2006,"My movie tastes tend to revolve more around violent horror movies and long forgotten cult gems; but I always enjoy a well done entertainment romp, even if it is completely mainstream and I've got to say that after catching this film for no other reason than that there was nothing else on the telly, I'm actually glad there wasn't anything else to watch. On paper, this film really sounds like a recipe for disaster; we've got Bruce Willis playing a hit-man with a heart, a trio of under-worked Hollywood actresses and one of the less popular members of the cast of Friends in a silly comedy directed by the same man who brought us 'Sgt. Bilko'...but thankfully, the movie is more than the sum of it's parts and despite more than a few problems; comes together as a fine whole. The plot follows a struggling dentist with a bitch wife, who gets a new neighbour in the form of Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski; a man wanted by several members of society's seedy underbelly. This propels the hapless dentist into a compromising situation when his wife decides that it would be a good idea to shop the hit-man to the relevant people for a 'finder's fee'! Despite a few plotting errors, Jonathon Lynn manages to keep the laughs coming and while a lot of the film revolves around ideas that have been seen before; many of these are put to use in clever ways, the funniest of which being the meeting between our hit-man and a young lady named Jill. The film works better as a comedy than as a thriller, but Lynn doesn't forget his story and the plot features a number of unexpected twists and turns that manage to somehow keep the audience wanting more while making them laugh at the same time. The cast list is strong, with Bruce Willis doing well in a comedic role and getting good feedback from the surprisingly funny Mathew Perry. Having not seen a lot Friends, I can't say how similar his character here is; but he plays the rat in a cage role well. The support cast includes a number of faces including Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollack and the state trooper from Dumb and Dumber. Only Natasha Henstridge looks like a spare wheel in her rather undemanding role. The Whole Nine Yards was given a needless sequel four years later, and while this film isn't good enough to make me want to go out of my way to catch that; it's certainly good enough for a single viewing.",The Whole Nine Yards
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,The Whole Nine Yards Of Fun!,7,11 September 2007,"I rented The Whole Nine Yards a few days ago, and just watched it this morning, I'm such a huge Bruce Willis fan, I don't see him that often in comedies, so I was curious how this would work. But after viewing this film, I have to just say that this movie was just so funny! I couldn't believe how much it made me laugh, I know it's such a dark subject, but it was pretty cool how they just turned into a zanny comedy. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry were just the most perfect choices, they were like ying and yang. Matthew as this guy who just is scared of everything and finally has something at the end to say where he has control and Bruce couldn't have been a more perfect choice as the cocky and yet charismatic hit man who could be threatening but yet the most likable guy in the world. The story was just very clever and worked so well with the cast.Nick is just your average guy, he is a dentist and a very likable guy, but he gets walked on quite a bit, especially by his wife who he feels like he owes her family, so he won't divorce her. But one day, a new neighbor moves in, Nick notices him pretty much off the bat, it's Jimmy ""the tulip"" Tudeski, the famous hit man who has killed 17 people and also ratted out his boss. He's on the run from his boss in Chicago and has a ransom on his head. Nick actually likes Jimmy, but his wife, Sophie, says to turn him in and get the award. He goes to Chicago and falls in love with Jimmy's wife, Cynthia. When Nick comes back home to Canada, he learns from Jimmy that his wife has gone to hire a hit man to kill Nick. But Nick also learns that Jimmy wants to kill Cynthia, Jimmy's boss wants to kill Nick, Nick's receptionist is also a hit woman, pretty much everyone wants to kill everyone.That's pretty much the best way to sum up The Whole Nine Yards, but trust me when I say that this is such a fun movie. I really had a good time watching this movie, Bruce Willis was just so great. But I have to admit that Amanda Peet's performance floored me when she was just admiring Bruce's work and getting advice from him on what her first hit should be like. She was just so adorable while being deadly. So please, I would recommend this film, it's a dark comedy, yes, but it's all good, just learn to let go and have fun if you're very sensitive on the subject.7/10",The Whole Nine Yards

21,MovieAddict2016,Lame.,5,18 June 2005,"This is a lame comedy about a hit-man (Bruce Willis) who buddy-buddies with his next-door neighbor, a dentist (Chandler), to predictable results. It has a few brief inspired moments, but they're far apart and even then don't deliver all they should. It borrows its style from ""There's Something About Mary"" (and at least it's got an R-rating) but isn't as funny.The acting is OK. Willis is basically on cruise control doing his typical steely-blue-eyes glare while Perry is the put-upon Gen X loser who says the words ""like"" and ""umm"" a lot and talks like the cast of ""Clueless."" He's basically Chandler again, only there's no Joey to bounce the jokes off of. The script must have gone like this: BRUCE WILLIS stares a lot.BRUCE WILLIS: Hi, I'm a hit-man let's be friends.MATTHEW PERRY: Could I BE any more uncomfortable and put-upon? BRUCE WILLIS stares at Matthew Perry some more.The End.I guess it made a bit of a splash when it came out because a sequel was released a couple years later - fortunately it flopped and we won't have to endure ""The Whole Eleven Yards and Six Inches"" any time soon.2/5.",The Whole Nine Yards

This is also an effective crime film and mixed with the comedy, it makes for a pleasing film for adults to enjoy. What I find funny here is how this film seems to have everyone as a victim of being whacked. Not only does this have pretty funny one-liners, there is an ample amount of physical comedy such as when Matt Perry keeps on running into doors or Michael Clarke Duncan himself.Jonathan Lynn's film is about a dentist named Oz who lives unhappily with his wife. When a contracted killer moves in next door, Oz's wife wants to hire Jimmy to kill him, but he refuses. Oz, meanwhile, is in Chicago so he will be able to rat out Jimmy to his former boss setting the stage for some rather hilarious consequences.The acting is very good. Bruce Willis doesn't usually do comedies, but when he does it's gold. Willis has enough wit and charm to lead a comedy and like he proved in his Die Hard films, he does know how to be funny when time is called for. On the other side of the spectrum, Matthew Perry known for his role in Friends, does what he did well in that show and that is to be funny. Despite him being funny, he would probably do what anyone would do if a hit man moved in next door. Also, Amanda Peet delivers a career-performance as Jill who just cracks me up in nearly every scene.Overall, this is a hilarious film that has a unusual mix of comedy, mafia, and action. For every bullet, there is enough comedy to last a fortnight. I heard good things about this film, but I didn't know this film would be this funny. A pairing of Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry is worth the while. I rate this film 9/10.",The Whole Nine Yards

I was really surprised by how funny Matt Perry was, even though he did overdo it at times, and it had quite a few cool twists and turns as well!, plus I was really surprised by the cool ending, I knew Oz was going to stay alive, but that's not the way I thought it was going to happen. All the characters were very likable, however Rosanna Arquette and her accent seriously got on my nerves!. I was laughing quite a bit throughout this film, and I thought it was well made and written as well, plus Perry and Henstridge had very good chemistry together. I am looking forward to the sequel, even though I heard it was really bad, and I must say I was quite surprised on how good this movie was, plus Matthew Perry added some great slapstick humor in my opinion. This is a clever mobster Comedy that's very funny, with fun performances all around and a really cool ending!, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great. Jonathan Lynn does a great job here, with solid camera work and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Actingis wonderful!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is hilarious was damn cool, had great chemistry with Perry and Peet, had his usual wonderful charisma, had some cool lines, seemed to be enjoying himself, had an unpredictable character, as he was just perfect for this part!. (Willis Rules!!!!!!!).Matthew Perry is surprisingly funny here, he had me cracking up a lot, and only at times did he over do it, he had a likable charm, and had good chemistry with Henstridge and Willis. Rosanna Arquette annoyed the crap out of me here, especially with her god awful accent, granted she played her role well, but i was begging for her to get waxed. Michael Clarke Duncan does what he has to do very well, he had presence, and had a cool character i liked him. Natasha Henstridge is stunningly gorgeous, and did excellent with what she had to do, and also had good chemistry with Perry!, she is also very sexy. Amanda Peet is very cute and was funny, she was energetic and quite likable!,the scenes with her and Willis were great. Kevin Pollak is OK here, but his accent was terrible and he didn't have much to do. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",The Whole Nine Yards
25,tabuno,A Sharp Entertaining Comedy,8,18 January 2019,"8 August 2010. What is difficult to determine is whether it's Matthew Perry, from FRIENDS (1994-2004) or Mitchell Kapner, the writer of the movie that makes the comedy mesh so well, from the physical gags that seem to be pretty lame but are artfully presented on screen so that they are fresh and really funny. This is a predictable comedy, mystery, crime thriller that still is able to shake and twist its premise into something interesting and sufficiently new that it makes the movie entertaining, hilarious, and decently above the average comedy movie. Natasha Henstridge from SPECIES (1995) has the elegance and style to carry off her serious character while the rest of the supporting cast along with Bruce Willis add that sure and charismatic charm of a solid romantic comedy. While this movie doesn't shake the roof off, present a classic, new bold award-winning combination, it is layered enough with a captivating plot with a dash of substance (the test of love) and performances that it makes for a really nice experience, in other words, a good time.",The Whole Nine Yards

As the cowardly dentist, Perry delivers the wise cracks as if he were still playing Chandler on ""Friends,"" but he does have some funny moments. Henstridge is pretty but cold as Willis's wife while Peet is sexy and funny as an aspiring hit woman. Sporting a European accent, Arquette is amusing as Perry's nagging wife. Clarke is smooth as a hulking henchman. The script doesn't really mine the material for all the potential laughs but it's entertaining.",The Whole Nine Yards
27,The-Sarkologist,A quaint black comedy about a dentist and a hit man.,7,22 February 2014,"I think the term 'Black Comedy' best describes this film because it does not necessarily fall into the category of art-house, nor do I believe that it falls into the category of independent, though I would certainly not consider it your typical Hollywood film (an though it is set in Canada I believe it is basically an American films). The story is about a dentist named Oz who is married to a wife that makes one wonder if he is being punished for a crime that he committed in another life and is stuck paying off her father's debt that he inherited after her father committed suicide.Then a former hit-man who ratted out a Chicago mob boss moves in next door and she sees a double opportunity. First she could rat him out to the Chicago mob and collect on a finder's fee, and secondly (if that doesn't work out) she can hire him to kill Oz so she can collect on his life insurance. The problem is that she has already been trying to do this, and the last assassin she hired ended up liking Oz and could not bring herself around to killing him. As for Oz, while he is in Chicago he ends up meeting the hit-man's wife and falling in love with her, only to discover that the hit-man does not believe in divorce.This is a great movie that will have you in absolute stitches the first time you see it (and maybe the second time as well) however the problem is that it relies too much upon the many twists and turns and in the end, once you know what is going to happen, it ceases to be all that wonderful anymore. Unfortunately this film simply does not have the staying power that some of the other black comedies that I own have, and in fact it seems to have pretty much fallen to the wayside. In a way it is not like Pulp Fiction or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, that have a cult following, but rather one of those films that you can say, oh, I remember that, and then move on to something else.",The Whole Nine Yards

29,sol-,Not your average neighbour,7,9 January 2017,"Deep in debt, a suburban dentist is persuaded to inform on a contract killer (with a bounty on his head) when he moves next door, only to experience a crisis of conscious after befriending the man in this zesty comedy starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. Both leads shine in roles that seem tailor-made for them. Some of Perry's reactions are over-the-top upon realising his neighbor's identity, but they lead to some incredibly funny moments like Willis offering him a tulip at a market (his signature flower for victims). There is something quite magnificent about the deadpan performance that Willis provides too; he comes off so genuine in his conversations where he calls Perry a friend and so relaxed when talking about his business, and yet still possesses a sense of danger when it comes to the sporadic action scenes. Amanda Peet delivers a layered supporting performance too as her character gradually becomes more complex. The plot admittedly does not stack up to close scrutiny. If Willis is hiding out, why do nothing to hide his appearance? And why would he be so confident to casually wander the streets? A side plot with Perry's wife hiring her own hit-man to kill him is also amusing, but the coincidences needed to have both plots to overlap stretch credibility. The dialogue sparkles so much here though that any script deficiencies are easy to overlook. The movie is also unafraid to treat murder, deception and infidelity in a very lighthearted way, which in turns makes it more laugh-out-loud funny than the average black comedy out there.",The Whole Nine Yards
30,johnnyboyz,It has its moments,6,15 August 2003,"'The whole nine yards' is a pretty funny film, don't get me wrong but like any other comedy, it still has its flaws. First glance at the cast you think ' oh yes, this'll be a winner!' Bruce Willis is perhaps not an expert in the comedy genre but then you see Mattew Perry there and you might think that it may actually be quite good because there's someone there to back up Willis. Both actors provide good acting in their roles and are well supported by some others such as Perry's characters wife. The thing I found with 'The whole nine yards' was that when it was funny, it was hilarious and when it wasn't any where near what it should be doing (making me laugh) it was terrible. I think this should have been a more 'escapism' comedy genre like 'Rat Race' which was a free for all, out and out farce and was great but with an actor like Willis, there has to be some sort of half decent plot involved and that is one involving hit men. If you haven't turned your brain off expecting laughs all along the way, there is actually a half clever plot involving an assassination but chances are, you'll find it very confusing on first viewing at least. I'd say rent this or wait for it to come onto the TV because it isn't the sort of film that I'd expect MANY people to enjoy several times.",The Whole Nine Yards

Unlike the previous mentioned, this one is a pure comedy that is first successful by its cast: mixing some experts in comedy (Perry, Peet) with others who play against nature: Rosanna is cute as a dangerous desperate housewife and Willis plays a hit-man ""à la"" Brando in the ""Godfather"": no action, just a presence with his stare and words. The plot is imaginative with a lot of surprises and funny moments. Another good point is having Montréal as location because it's a refreshing change and as french is spoken there, the cast tries it as well. All this is done with an unknown director (at last for me) so this is finally a very good surprise!",The Whole Nine Yards
32,dfranzen70,Whole Nine Yards registers a personal foul,5,24 July 2000,"Matthew Perry plays a dentist who finds that his new next-door neighbor is Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). What to do, what to do. Henpecked by his sexy, meanspirited wife (Rosanna Arquette), Oz (Perry) travels from his Canadian home to Chicago to find out if there's a finder's fee for The Tulip, who's on the lam from some ornery mobsters (led by a ineffectual Kevin Pollak). And it's there where he runs into Jimmy's wife (Natasha Henstridge). And you can kind of see where it all goes from here.
Oh sure, they try to make the plot complicated, but if you have the IQ of a gnat (as well as the attention span), chances are you'll be correctly predicting scenes well before they arrive. The plot is essentially contrived to the max, with carbon-copy characters that are buoyed only by the actors' performances. It's a comedy, to be sure, but it's simply not a very good one. This isn't a non-stop laughter kind of movie - it does have its good lines, but they're about as frequent as an on-key Rosanne rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner.Perry is amazingly miscast as Oz the Dentist; he's bland, uninspiring, and practically melts into the background. For a dentist whose first scene has him showing off his dazzling smile, he hardly ever smiles the whole rest of the movie! (And yes, this IS a comedy!). By contrast, Willis effectively underplays his role as the itinerant mobster. Unlike Stallone, Schwarzenegger, et al, Willis is perfectly willing to shed his tough-guy-as-hero image to play other roles. He takes on supporting roles, he takes on self-deprecating roles, and he does it all with style and verve. Willis can even get his point across while hardly raising his voice above a whisper - try THAT, Stallone (see Over the Top)!Now, if you're a guy, you'll be happy to know there are plenty of hot women in here, and one even gets partially naked. And the men all have guns and talk tough - except for Oz, of course. (It's kind of like Mickey Blue Eyes, except without the effortless wit of Hugh Grant.)Despite the billing, it's Willis' show all the way. He's not a nice guy - he's a KILLER! - but despite his foibles, he's still the man in charge. Perry, on the other hand, is a weenie, but he can't even play one effectively. I found him to be boring and rather annoying. (Note to Matthew - GET A NEW AGENT! You need to be in ensemble movies; you're definitely not the leading man type.) So the biggest virtue of this movie is the performance of Willis - if you're a fan of his work, you'll enjoy his playful sendup of his own tough-guy characters.",The Whole Nine Yards

The one thing that scared me about this movie was some of the violence, especially the fight between Frankie (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Oz (Matthew Perry) when Oz first got to his hotel room. I was kind of surprised when I discovered that Frankie was sitting in Oz's hotel room waiting for him. To me, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) looked very beautiful in everything she wore, especially the dress she wore when she first showed up in the film.

He's living with his wife Sophie (Arquette), who hates him, and his mother-in-law who may even hate him more. His working as a dentist, but have to pay off a loan after his embezzling father-in-law, who then committed suicide. His unpleasant and boring life take a turn when he recognizes that the new neighbor moving in is the hit-man Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski (Willis). The Tulip is sought after by the Chichago mafia boss Janni Gogolak (Pollak) and Oz is sent to Chicago by his wife to collect a ""finders fee"". In Chicago, things get even more complicated. He learns that both Janni and Jimmy is after some money, put away in a bank account. To access the money Janni, Jimmy and Cynthia (Henstridge), Jimmy's wife (that he does not love anymore), must all be present, or a valid death certificate be presented. Oz however, quickly fall in love with Cynthia, and goes back to Montreal to help Janni, and his hit-man Frankie Figueroa (Duncan) to set up the hit on Janni. Oz also learns that Frankie is in league with Jimmy, setting his own boss up, and that Oz's wife Sophie is trying to hire her own hit-man to kill him (and collect his life insurance) which leads to his assistant Jill (Peet). So, Oz just have to play both ends of a mafia hit, save his new love Cynthia and survive his wife attempts on his life. Plus, he doesn't know if Jimmy will let him live afterward either...This is a great action comedy with emphasis on comedy. An imaginative plot with great feeling and finesse to create funny situations and details. Also the acting and casting is great. Willis and Perry are superb in their roles as Jimmy and Oz. Peet, Duncan and Henstridge are giving very nice performances in supporting roles. No dull moments and the imaginative plot is entertaining to follow and see how poor Oz is trying to cope with his new complicated life.8/10",The Whole Nine Yards
36,Boyo-2,"Gee, everyone is so sensitive to a mob comedy!",7,29 May 2001,"Judging from the comments below, I guess being a hitman is not much to laugh at...and the term 'black comedy' doesn't come to anyone's mind? Does that extend to the fact that without George Raft going after Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis in ""Some Like It Hot"", they would have no reason to meet Marilyn, get on a train to Miami, etc. etc. ??Of course its not funny in real life that people get killed. But this comedy starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry is very well done and had me laughing about it even when it was over.  It was so over the top and so overpopulated with killers and gangsters and contract killings that at times its hard to remember what's going on and who is out to kill whom, but it does not matter at all since its all in fun.I do not like either of the leads, generally speaking.  I liked about five out of all Bruce Willis' movies and Perry I've seen on his tv show and enjoyed him but never really thought about him much.  In this they are both very well cast and when they strike up a friendship, its believable.  Willis does not do a 'goombah, fuggetaboutit' attitude or accent, thankfully, even though his character has an Italian surname, and does not mug for the audience at all. Amanda Peet is very funny as a wanna-be hitwoman and a fan of the real killers, and Michael Clarke Duncan is also very funny. 
Only downside is Rosanna Arquette - bad casting choice here!  Maybe someone owed her a favor.  Ironically, she is not one of the people who has a contract out on her, though God knows she's annoying enough for one.",The Whole Nine Yards

Even thought we have an innovative direction with an ironic and original story, sometimes we have bad conversations, allied with bad performances and an implausible plot. Matthew Perry acts in this movie exactly like he does in ""Friends"", which shows he's not able to perform much differently than that. Bruce Willis does his job professionally, but the absurd plot ruins his character. You know, EVERYBODY in this movie seems to be a potential killer, and they talk about that very calmly. People who want to kill others usually aren't that peaceful. My other complaint is that we have too few funny scenes; after 40 minutes of length we don't know if this is a comedy or just a random and pointless film. I must confess I turned it off before completing the first hour, due to the great tedious it lured me into. It's not my fault as a viewer that it is simply boring and nothing ever happens; maybe with a more plausible story this would've worked better. Bad movie anyways.",The Whole Nine Yards
39,PredragReviews,"In the heart of suburbia, a hit man with heart has just moved in!",7,22 February 2017,"This movie has more twists and turns than a mountain road. The cast is great starting out with the marvelously talented Bruce Willis. Matthew Perry, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet. The premise is perfect for this sort of dark comedy. The main character played wonderfully by Matthew Perry is funny, sharp witted and makes you get in the guys' corner right from the start. The man has more than a couple of reasons to suck carbon monoxide but he continues on in spite of being a dentist married to a shrew that wants him dead for monetary reasons, his new neighbor is a notorious hit man for the Chicago mob that has anger management problems, and his dental receptionist is secretly a beginner in the hit man game plotting his demise for his shrew wife. There, now the story is set except for the romantic interest the gorgeous Nastasha Henstridge who just happens to be the wife of Bruce Willis, Matthews' new neighbor. I tell you, what's not to like about this mix of dripping satire and ill born love at first sight. On the surface the movie seems like another one of the usual Hollywood ""just for the money"" movies, but, give it a chance and it will definitely grab your attention despite a short sequence of gratuitous T&A featuring Amanda Peet that really isn't needed. All told you have a witty, funny and very entertaining movie that you will want to enjoy again and again.There is scarcely a moment in the film that is not at least chuckle- worthy! Even the minor characters (mother-in-law, mob henchmen, Canadian cops, dental patients) are flawlessly played. Matthew Perry is absolutely brilliant, and Bruce Willis underplays his role in perfect counterpoint to Perry's over-the-top goofiness. Nothing is missing: there's suspense, action, plot-twists, surprises, sight- gags, slapstick, and glib repartee galore to give you sniggers, chuckles, guffaws, and outright belly-laughs throughout.

Matthew Perry's performance isn't groundbreaking, and as a Friends fan, I couldn't help but finding similarities with his mimics there and on the show. But I also think the part was tailor made for him. Bruce Willis is the best in everything he's in. Especially comedies like these. And you really have a great time seeing him play that role. The lead actresses are great as well. Especially Amanda Peet, but Natasha Henstridge gives just the right amount of noir heroine to her character.

It's a clever comedy from director Jonathan Lynn(Who did the fantastic comedy My Cousin Vinney). I didn't quite think this was as good as My Cousin Vinney, but it was still a genius comedy. Bruce Willis is actually very funny as a mobster. But, as we've seen in previous films, Bruce Willis can do anything. The Whole nine yards has tons of fantastic performances by Matthew Perry, Michael Clarke Duncan, and an actress who I will never forget. Amanda Peet. Amanda Peet is a great actress and is really funny in tons of her films. I liked The Whole nine yards because it's one of those comedies that you may not see that much of. Something different that just blows your mind. It blew mine. The best performances in the film are from Bruce Willis and Amanda Peet.

I took this opportunity, though it wouldn't have been a great loss if I hadn't, as it was a pretty underwhelming experience. (I would probably still know nothing about this film to this day if I didn't know about it coming on TV.) This summer will mark two years since I first saw the film, and I have given it another try. Sometimes, films can improve with a second viewing, but for me, that was not the case with ""The Whole Nine Yards"", so I highly doubt I will ever be watching it a third time.Nicholas ""Oz"" Oseransky is an American dentist who currently lives in Montréal, Québec, Canada with his French-Canadian wife, Sophie. Sadly, Sophie is one horrible, self-centred, freeloading woman who makes Oz's life miserable, and he cannot divorce her until he finishes paying off his debts! Things only get worse for the poor dentist when Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, a hit-man from Chicago, moves in next door! The mob now want Tudeski dead for ratting them out, so he is now taking refuge in Montréal, under a new name, Jimmy Jones, but Oz soon figures out who he really is! When Sophie learns about Jimmy and why he's here, she has a new plan, for her own personal gain, of course! She sends Oz to Chicago to tell the mob where to find Jimmy, and he goes after she threatens to make his life even more miserable if he doesn't! After he leaves, Sophie tells Jimmy about why he has gone to Chicago behind his back, as she can make even more money if her husband is killed! Since this movie is a comedy, I was obviously hoping for some good laughs, which I didn't get. The second time I watched it, some parts definitely sparked a smile, and a VERY rare snicker, but none of these scenes are too memorable. When the gags aren't mediocre, they're usually lame, like when Oz throws up. The Sophie character is supposed to be funny, and so is the conflict between the couple, but both are actually pretty annoying, and I felt a little uncomfortable during the scenes involving her. Since it's a mob film, one would also hope for a decent amount of suspense, and there is a bit of that here, but not enough. More than one thing makes the story awkward, including the marriage. Either Sophie hid her true personality very well before they got married, or Oz was just really stupid, and I think a conversation at one point in the film suggests the latter! With all these problems, ""The Whole Nine Yards"" was a disappointment coming out the year after ""Analyze This"", a superior gangster comedy.",The Whole Nine Yards
43,jhclues,Black Comedy from Jonathan Lynn,7,2 September 2001,"Is a guy who has killed seventeen people necessarily a `bad' guy?  Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves, to be sure, but what if that guy moved in next door to you?  It's a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in `The Whole Nine Yards,' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he's on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes. But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out, it seems, is down...	What Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There's not a lot of depth, but it's not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried.	Willis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy's guarded but confident manner into perspective. Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally.  Like Chow Yun-Fat in `The Killer,' Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm's length who he is  and what he is capable of, it's a bit disconcerting.  And that's one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn. 
	Perry is excellent, as well, as `Oz.'  Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in `It's A Gift' or `The Bank Dick,' although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.	The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez).  It may not be the most original movie ever made, but `The Whole Nine Yards' is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you've basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do:  Entertain.  It's not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it's going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.  Which, when you think about it, is not such a bad deal.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",The Whole Nine Yards

In fact, Amanda Peet deserves special recognition for her absolute lack of embarrassment during her nude scenes. I haven't seen such an unselfconscious display since Matilda May in LIFEFORCE.  Nevertheless, it is to Peet's great credit that she transcends being a collection of luscious body parts and creates a truly memorable character.

Matthew Perry of course brings his clumsy comic stuff into the movie with bit of slapstick and he does it like in Friends. Then we have Amanda Peet, who is pretty funny also, especially when the goofy laugh comes up when she is meeting the Tulip. A big surprise for me was Natasha Henstidge who was good also. She has really come a long way from the alien sexmachine in Species, over the love interest of van Damme in Maximum Risk back to the sexmachine in the cheap bad and soooooo bad sequel Species 2. Then I thought, well that career is over, but here she is, alongside one of the best paid and most famous actors of this time Mr. Willis (although they don't have a scene together).

Bruce Willis is so funny, not in this movie, but just in general. Matthew Perry holds his own and is in no way disappointing. Kevin Pollack is comical and dialed in. Natasha Henstridge is worth all the risk. I cannot get enough of Roseanna Arquette's character. Amanda Peet hands down gives the best performance, she really has nice tits. Michael Clarke Duncan provides a strong supporting presence. Harland Williams is well-cast and adds his bit of funny to the movie. The Whole Nine Yards is silly and entertaining the whole way through. The part at the very end on the boat where Jimmy tosses Oz the canned beer but it just flies right past his head, that's a classic funny moment!",The Whole Nine Yards

The movie is somewhat effective in telling its story, basically rides on the performances of Perry who is not bad here, has his moments, and Willis who does a decent enough job. The screenplay is just average, but satisfactory, while everything from the music, cinematography and overall editing and direction is just pretty standard. This is one of those ""okay"" movies, not bad to pass time by, but your not missing anything too important if you skip this one. IMDb Rating: 6.6. MY Rating: 7/10",The Whole Nine Yards
50,Movie-12,"Actually very funny and entertaining, with a great cast. *** (out of four)",8,14 January 2001,"THE WHOLE NINE YARDS / (2000) *** (out of four)Matthew Perry plays Oz, a down-on-his-luck suburban dentist whose wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), a spoiled French Canadian, wants him dead. She has already hired a hitman, the secretary at his office, Jill (Amanda Peet), but she got to liking Oz and ended up permanently working for him. Bruce Willis is one of the nations most nitrous professional hitmen, named Jimmy. He moves in next door to Oz, conspires with Oz's spouse, and that leaves Oz in Chicago to find Jimmy's arch enemy, Ganni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), and his estranged but beautiful wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) over legal issues.Other important characters include Frankie Figgs (Michael Clarke Duncan), a huge, bear-like individual who takes Oz to meet Janni. There is also ""Rocketman"" star Harland Williams as a local undercover cop who becomes involved with the devious doings of Sophie. What do all of these characters want? Jimmy, Cynthia, and Janni are after a ten million dollar prize on each other's heads; Jill wants to become a professional hitman; Frankie wants to kill people and please his leaders, and Oz just wants out of the entire mess.	 ""The Whole Nine Yards"" has an engrossingly entertaining setup, even without thorough character introduction. This kind of movie does not need character development as long as we can enjoy the premise. The comical atmosphere makes up for the few holes in the writing; the story moves along smoothly. Although we have seen this kind of material before in ""Grosse Point Blank"" and ""Analyze This,"" never has it been this imaginatively zany and hilariously inventive. 	What makes this movie so effective is the array of perfectly cast characters. Matthew Perry is hilarious in a reactive, clumsy role that clearly fits his personality. Rosanna Arquette is also flawless in an annoying, biting character. Bruce Willis is stunningly suave in a portrayal that, for the first time in a long while, creates a calm, cool, and collected character. Amanda Peet (""Whipped"") and Natasha Richardson (""Species"") are both immensely beautiful; all they really need to do present themselves on screen for audiences to enjoy their presence.	The labyrinthine plot in ""The Whole Nine Yards"" becomes more complicated than many viewers might expect. Bruce Willis eventually becomes more of an underlying tone in the film to propel the story along, and a lot of active material is discarded rather than performed. There is a cute little romantic subplot, also, but it does not feel like much in a plot where so much transpires, and the important story nuggets are scattered all over the board. Because of this, the third act suffers from a mild case of the hiccups when the initial conflict is completely resolved, only for the writers to build for yet another climax. This is an unusual structure...but this is an unusual movie. 	""The Whole Nine Yards"" is not a terrific movie, but it is a funny and amusing one. Compare this comedy caper to other so-called parodies released within the past year and you will see why it is such an achievement when a comedy comes around that actually fits the definition of a comedy.",The Whole Nine Yards
51,FlickJunkie-2,"Low brow, but good",7,20 July 2000,"Some comedies have universal appeal.  This isn't one of them.  That is not to say it isn't funny and entertaining, because it is.  However, it takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy it.  There are two facets to the humor.  The first is the physical comedy of Matthew Perry, which is mostly pratfall humor.  I enjoy such slapstick if it doesn't go overboard (like when he bangs his head on the steering wheel; the first time was funny the second time was overkill) but mostly Perry stays on the funny side of fatuous.The second facet was situational comedy where everyone was put in peculiar situations and forced to make decisions about how to behave.  This was the stronger element of the film and though the dialogue was often weak, the situations were droll and often produced hysterical results.The directing by Jonathan Lynn was straightforward, giving Perry wide latitude on shaping his character and much of the comedy.  From what I understand, Perry was improvising about half the time, which clearly gave the film a comedic boost.The acting was generally good.  Bruce Willis plays the straight man as a contract killer with a sense of humor.  Willis is always understated in his comedy roles, which was perfect considering Perry's antics.  Mostly Bruce just looked tough and smirked a lot.  Matthew Perry was full of energy and spontaneity.  He tended to go overboard at times, but he produced a lot of great sight gags and frenetic humor, which more than compensated for his excesses.  Michael Clarke Duncan once again makes a tough guy affable.  I always enjoy his work.  Natasha Henstridge took her role far too seriously, playing it more like a gangland drama than the comedy it was.  Amanda Peet's main purpose in this film was to take her top off and create a distraction.  In that regard, she succeeded nicely.  Rounding out the cast was Rosanna Arquette, whose French accent was terrible, but she was amusingly nasty in the villain role.Overall, this was a good comedy for people who enjoy inane low brow humor. I am one of those people so I gave it a 7/10.  However, for those looking for a snappy plot and intelligent dialogue, this film will probably disappoint.",The Whole Nine Yards
52,redkiwi,Hit or be hit,7,4 June 2000,"This was particularly enjoyable, highlighted by Bruce Willis' excellent performance as hitman Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski.Willis moves in next door to dentist Matthew Perry, he who stars in that particularly annoyingly smug and unfunny 'comedy' Friends.  He was however also good in what was an amusing tale somewhat in the style of Hugh Grant's Micky Blue Eyes, although not anywhere near as funny.Perry gets tied up in a series of contract killings, as Willis and his former employers try to knock each other off; beside Perry's wife [Arquette] trying to do the same to him.The inevitable love interest comes by with Perry getting involved with Willis' wife [the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge] and the whole film - despite being all over the place - was actually a lot of fun and worth a look.",The Whole Nine Yards
53,moviesleuth2,Great Friday Night Flick,8,10 November 2009,"Now here is a rare breed: a mainstream movie that works at just about every level without dumbing anything down or making the average viewer think too hard. ""The Whole Nine Yards"" is a great movie to simply sit back and enjoy.Nicholas ""Oz"" Ozeransky (Matthew Perry) is a mild-mannered dentist whose stuck with a wife who hates him (Rosanna Arquette in a hilariously over-the-top performance) and a huge debt that his partner (his father-in-law) left him when he kicked the bucket. Then his new neighbor moves in. This neighbor, much to Oz's horror, is none other than Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), the infamous hit-man for the Gogolak gang. Oz's wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a ""finder's fee."" Oz obviously refuses, but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this, she'll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses, new romances, and hamburgers with mayonnaise.The cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panic-mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It's a typecast role, but Willis plays him with a slight tongue-in-cheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs, it also gives him an air of menace, which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy's capacity for violence, but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy's ex-wife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also well-cast as Jimmy's fellow hit-man, Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so over-the-top that their performances must be seen to be believed.But as good as this cast is, and it's great, the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn't just steal her scenes, she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz's ditzy receptionist, who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical; her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod, if not a win.""The Whole Nine Yards"" is a mix of film-noir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre, including mixing and matching the character traits of the femme-fatale and the ""good girl"" (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie). What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not over-the-top exaggeration humor (like The Farrelly Brothers). This is more about timing and dialogue; it's like a 1930's screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure, the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre: the twisty plot. ""The Whole Nine Yards"" boasts plenty of surprises, and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean you can tell where it's going.Mixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not, one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is well-paced, and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no over-the-top visual effects, and that's a good thing.""The Whole Nine Yards"" may not be classic film material, but it's highly entertaining. And with a movie like this, that's just about all that one could ask for.",The Whole Nine Yards
54,movieguy1021,The Whole Nine Yards: 6/10,7,9 October 2002,"Jonathan Lynn, who directed Clue, also directed The Whole Nine Yards; you can see some hints of his madcap and over-the-top directing in both movies.Matthew Perry plays Nicholas ""Oz"" Oseransky, a dentist who can't seem to make much money. That could be because he has to pay off his father-in-law's debt, and his wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), makes sure that he pays it (his father-in-law and he worked together). Sophie sounds a lot like Yvette from Clue. Oz is unhappily married, and wants to divorce Sophie ASAP. After meeting Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), Sophie thinks of a way to get out of debt.Jimmy was a contract killer who just spent five years in prison. So Sophie makes Oz go to Chicago and find the son of a mob boss that Jimmy killed to rat Jimmy out so that he can get money for a finder's fee. And that's just the first reel.The movie feels like a drama where the actors don't think that they're funny, but they are. As director Lynn said on the commentary on the DVD, ""You could make it a drama and not take out any words."" But, it's a comedy, and Perry adds some physical humor to the otherwise ""wordy"" humor.Willis plays great in these type of roles-the comedic bad guys, the part where he can be funny but is also in a serious role. I liked him in this role; and so did he.My favorite character was Jill St. Clair, played by Amanda Peet. She was good as Oz's secretary who falls in love with Jimmy. It's obvious she wasn't that comfortable with her nude scene, but she managed to get through it, and I hope she's as good in the sequel.Michael Clarke Duncan played Frankie Figs, someone who supposedly works for Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the son I mentioned earlier. He came on to work right after he finished with The Green Mile, and his roles couldn't be any more different. He shows his ""big-ness"" in here too, and it's worth seeing TWNY just to see Perry run into him.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was it wasn't always funny. I thought that the plot had a few too many twists and turns for a comedy, but it could be a new ""style"". But, I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind paying attention in movies, because if you don't pay attention, you'll get lost.My rating: 6/10Rated R for nudity.",The Whole Nine Yards

This is a crime-comedy with all the goods from either world, and it's done *just right*. The plot is good, and the film's got that typical contorted type story at the middle of it linking many different characters, but still absolutely coherent and compelling. Perry really is very funny in this one, and it's about to be one crazy ride for this prude of a dentist when an ex- big time conman is his neighbor and he finds out who he is and somehow finds himself involved. This is a crazy ride, with lots of great fun and action, good laughs, a good atmosphere between tight tension and comedy relief, the supporting cast is great, and the plots within the plots are strong enough to make this a fairly layered piece of genre-hybrid cinema.

First of all Bruce Willis does not work in a comedy or as a tough mobster, he is limited to playing one character, the ""Die Hard"" and ""Fifth Element"" character. He's just not a good actor, he's ruined plenty of movies, including this one, by trying to play characters that he is terrible at.

59,Rammstein-2,Standardized and predictable,5,29 January 2001,"Being of a depressingly standardized form of American comedy, ""The Whole Nine Yards"" offers very few new laughs and is painfully predictable. The story is a pretty good one to start with, but is flattened quite effectively by a dull dialogue, stereotypic characters (bar one) and an awfully miscast Rosanna Arquette. Kevin Pollack as the gangster boss Gogolak is also a great mistake - not in the least intimidating and when introduced, a real bore to watch. The only refreshing detail is the completely unexpected character development that Amanda Peet performs, which raises the grade a bit and provides the only lasting impression once the credits roll. On the whole, its a slightly less than average movie that could have been a lot more with a bit more imaginative writing.",The Whole Nine Yards

He'd used all of his best ideas well before this.For this to work, you need an actor who can stake out a stance, and hold his ground. Woody (""Sleeper"")and Chevy (""Fletch"")can handle these parts...parts that require playing in that space between the movie and the audience. Scratch out Perry - he just doesn't have the arsenal. The bright spot, of course, is Willis, who DOES know how to mark off and patrol his territory when playing it strictly 'within the movie'. His timing is always on the money. This is far beneath him, though - he could have done this in his sleep. But at least he had Peet to give him sustenance - she seems to be a capable understudy.",The Whole Nine Yards

The, Whole Nine Yards has Matthew Perry as a goofy dentist who discovers his new neighbor (Bruce Willis) is a former mobster who's gone straight, but to only later discover that his wife (Rosanna Arquette) ordered a hit to be performed by the mobsters that Willis once worked for also to make the plot interesting and twisting Perry falls in love with the wife of Willis (Natasha Henstridge) and learns that his beautiful office assistant (Amanda Peet) finally gets her wish of becoming a mobster comes true and in the end after both Willis and Perry get the problems whacked out the happy ending of Perry and Henstridge together forever and the mob man and woman Willis and Peet together forever is cherished. Michael Clarke Duncan is great in a supporting role of a mobster but mainly the performance of Willis which once again proves his great depth as an actor and combined with the funny moments from Matthew Perry and the attractive performances from Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet is what makes this unusual but entertaining mob movie worth watching.",The Whole Nine Yards

Unlike the aforementioned, this one tries to toss in some drama and intrigue. It all comes off as believable, as finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.The talent involved is immense, and it has some good moments. Mafia comedies haven't been too hot lately (MAFIA! or THE GODSON-1998...WATCH THESE AT YOUR OWN PERIL), and this one is way above the norm. Yet, it throws too much on the plate to keep in balance. Matthew Perry's character becomes irritating after awhile, and he simply doesn't come across an earnest dupe.

The Oseransky's lives are changed when the house next door to them is bought by a mobster from the US, Jimmy The Tulip as he was known, played by Bruce Willis. The contrast between the hyperactive Oz and the cold, over the top Jimmy the Tulip is where this film is funniest. There are certain plot moments that sustains the movie, something to do with Jimmy's former wife Cynthia (the always fantastic looking Natasha Henstridge) who falls in love with Oz, and a humorously strange relationship that develops between Jimmy and Oz's dental hygienist Jill (Amanda Peet) who has an unusual interest in the world of mafia hit men. Michael Clark Duncan plays Jimmy's bodyguard, and the physical contrast between him and Matthew Perry makes for some of the funniest scenes in this light farce.

It seemed like for the most part the comic timing was slightly off, yet the jokes played very well.  It even kind of helped an off-beat movie to be off-beat. I laughed.  The whole movie was kind of the same-old same-old but it worked. The whole thing was designed from a technical standpoint to make you feel slightly off about it.  But everything works, and you laugh.  I won't repeat the plot, if you don't know it, watch the trailer.Bruce Willis, and Matthew Perry play off each other well.  But the addition of Michael Clarke Duncan, who was wonderful in this film, Natasha Henstridge, and Rosanna Arquette all worked better than the main leads.  If you look at this movie as an off-the-center comedy it all blends perfectly. If you look at this as a completely commercialized comedy, which it is, it won't work.  It is what it is not.  Either way, this movie should be checked out by everybody who likes mildly-dark comedies.  Those who like their comedies blacker than black will not care for this one as it isn't that dark (see Love Stinks, or Very Bad Things instead).  The weird parts of this film are just overall feelings.  The movie would possess a PG-13 rating if it did not have full frontal nudity, which is played out hilariously.  It isn't even explicit or seem too gratuitous.  It seemed natural to be naked.  That is what should happen with nudity.  It should be PG-13 because of its complete lack of foul language (although that never bothers me, see South Park) and its violence is completely tamed down, almost to the point of old B&W films.

After he finds out the truth about Sophie ""Oz"" falls in love with Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and it goes without saying that he is playing a dangerous game there (Falling for the wife of a mob hit man). He is also targeted by another gangster, Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan (Who died far too young)), and his associates. The entire film is about 'Oz' trying to survive various attempts on his life, and basically oblivious about the dangerous game he is playing, and the sort of characters he is dealing with. But its his decency that gets him through (Except when he frames Sophie for murder (She had it coming)). At the end of the film, there is a scene where Cynthia learns all 'Oz' really wants is to marry her, he does not care about money or anything else. As he said: ""I want to marry you more than anyone wanted to marry anyone in history."" In addition, Jimmy ends up falling in love with Cynthia and they will end up becoming married as well. What makes it work is this is a film with characters you like (And hate), beautiful women, a different setting than usual (Montreal), lots of laughs, lots of action, lots of twists and turns, and an intelligent script. For fans of mob films, Willis, Perry, and especially Peet (Who steals the film) it should be a must see.",The Whole Nine Yards
73,btm1,An unexpectedly well done feel good situation comedy,8,26 March 2009,"The plot of this escapist romantic crime comedy sounds like a TV situation comedy, but the film far exceeds expectations.Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Mathew Perry) is a dentist in Canada trapped in a horrible marriage. Although Oz is an honest and upright individual, he shared a practice with his father-in-law, who was convicted of embezzlement before the film begins, leaving Oz saddled with debt and living with his unloving rapacious wife and mother-in-law.Oz was originally from Chicago. He gets a new next door neighbor, Jimmy Jones (Bruce Willis). The dentist recognizes the neighbor is really Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, a hit man who ratted on a Chicago mobster, whose gang wants to kill him. The dentist's unloving wife, Sophie (deliciously played by Rosanna Arquette), is secretly trying to have her husband killed for his life insurance.Jill St. Claire (beautiful and talented Amanda Peete in a great major supporting role) is the dentists vivacious assistant, who turns out to be a Jimmy ""The Tulip"" groupie. She also pleasantly displays her other talents in a nude scene.A comic ""tangled web"" is woven as Sophie tries to cash in on the vendetta and Oz tries very credibly to prevent anyone from being killed.Both lead actors, Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, have played similar parts in the past. Willis continues to perform at his standard serio-comic excellence, and the rest of the cast play their parts a little tongue in cheek. But Perry appropriately plays the Oz character straight and believable, somewhat like the straight man in a comic duo.The various twists in the plot are fun and the ending is very satisfying. I rated it only 8 because, while I saw no flaws, I felt it should be a couple of points lower than such comedies as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway.""",The Whole Nine Yards
74,Captain Ed,Good fun for an evening,7,5 June 2000,"WARNING: MILD SPOILERI don't believe this film deserves either the high praise or damnation it's getting from IMDB users here.  It works well for what it is: an entertaining, frothy film, not out to deliver any sort of message or grand theme but just to deliver laughs.  Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis do journeyman work here, but the real joy here is in the supporting roles, especially Amanda Peet's twisted receptionist-cum-hitwoman and Michael Clarke Duncan, proving that he's going to be a screen presence for some time to come.Aside from the resolution of Duncan's character, which seems oddly harsh and out-of-place, the movie will flow over you as smoothly as a vanilla milk shake, with as much meaning or impact.

76,PeterJackson,Big Disappointment,5,12 May 2000,"I've been expecting this film for quite a while, having heard and read positive reviews about it(Ebert, IMDB,...). In Belgium however, this film was receive less enthusiastic by the critics. Nevertheless, I really wanted to see it and yesterday, in a sneak preview in Leuven, I finally could. And...to my own surprise, I really disliked it, whereas the rest of the people in the theater seemed pretty positive about it. Why was it so disappointing then? Well, I won't waste any time telling the plot. You'll find it elsewhere on these pages. The film has certainly some twists, but this is also one of the biggest problems: you've probably seen it all before.(and better done!) But the major flaw of this film was, in my opinion the bad directing and some uninspired acting. Jonathan Lynn is certainly no great comedy director. He's proved that already with GREEDY, MY COUSIN VINNY, SGT. BILKO, ...: these films range from ""pretty bad"" to ""just OK"", but none of them shows signs of great timing or remarkable comic moments. This film doesn't either. I can recall having laughed only once in the whole 96 min. Not only is this  a problem of directing, the script doesn't help much either. Go see ANALYZE THIS(which was great!), THE FRESHMAN and some other mob and crime parodies and tell me what's the difference with the ""jokes"" in this film, except for the fact that they worked better in those other movies. The script by Mitchell Kapner is so uninspired and predictable and borrows so much from other movies that it gets painful after a while.The actors can't be really blamed for these shortcomings. Bruce Willis is pretty good in his role as ""hit man with a heart""(see: his character in THE JACKAL). However, he doesn't have many comic moments. This was done much better by Robert De Niro in the aforementioned ANALYZE THIS. The real disappointment here however is Matthew Perry. He's another FRIENDS-actor that's excellent in that sitcom, but, like all his other FRIENDS-colleagues, still hasn't made a really good film.(Courteney Cox is good in SCREAM, but that's not really HER film) Note that Lisa Kudrow(another FRIENDS-member)played in ANALYZE THIS(!), in which she was the only person that wasn't funny! Perry gets very little to do in this film, but plays his character in such a monotonous in such a monotonous way that, after a while, he only succeeds in being irritating rather than being funny.The others show us no comic talents either: Rosanna Arquette(with some sort of French accent?)irritates too, Amanda Peet gets her best moments in the nude scenes(!), which however seem totally out of place and even Kevin Pollack has an bad part as the mob-boss-son(is that an Hungarian accent?). Michael Clarke Duncan(the giant from THE GREEN MILE) gives a reasonable performance, but has to watch out for type-casting. Only Natasha Henstridge(best known from the awful SPECIES-films)is satisfying in the only serious role of the film. Could it have something to do with the fact that she gets nothing ""funny"" to say?All in all, this film is disappointing as a comedy. However, it is gentle and good-natured(despite some mild violence) and I guess that it could work too, for people that haven't seen many other parodies on the crime genre. But the jokes are too familiar and the timing is too bad to make this film actually funny. And, let's admit it: Willis is no De Niro and Perry is no Crystal either. But I think that even those two couldn't have saved this film. 5/10",The Whole Nine Yards

I was kind of expecting him to play a lunatic serial killer, like in The Jackal, since he was an assassin again, but he was very tame this time around. The movie's general theme is comedy after all, Matthew Perry's strong point, but definitely not Willis's. Willis is most at home in an action-drama role. However, Amanda Peet was clearly the film's strongest contender. She really brightens up the mood whenever she's on screen.

The cast is very large it includes the three I mentioned before, Michael Clarke Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet,and Kevin Pollak. Matthew Perry is the key to this film. He can do some much. He's goofy comedy, sick comedy, stupid comedy, and physical comedy all mixed up into one person. If he plays it right he could be a sophisticated Jim Carrey. Bruce does the Bruce tough guy and is very funny. Michael Clarke Ducan is very cool and Amanda Peet is a great supporting cast member. She's beautiful, funny and deadly all at the same time. This is a mob comedy so there is some action for action fans. There have been bad mob comedies(Mickey Blue Eyes, Mafia!, Gun Shy) and there are great mob comedies(Grosse Pointe Blank, Analyze This).

89,segacs,"Fun, light entertainment",7,5 February 2005,"I watched this one on the dish the other day, eager to see Montreal in a movie actually playing Montreal, as opposed to masquerading as New York or Chicago or some other city. Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.The movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.Those are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.",The Whole Nine Yards

I have always liked Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, and I also quite like Michael Duncan and Amanda Peet. And of course, I love a good comedy. So I was pretty excited to see THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. It did not live up to my expectationsit soared past them.A resident of Canada, Oz Osercansky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist who is living with a wife (Rosanna Arquette) who he hates and she hates him, but they don't get a divorce for money reasons. When a hit man named Jimmy ""the Tulip"" Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves in next door, Oz finds out his wife is trying to find hit men that will kill him. Jimmy, who takes a liking to Oz, doesn't agree to kill Oz, but seeks Oz's help in getting Jimmy's wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and his enemy, Yanni (Kevin Pollak), together so he can kill them. Oz, along with another hit man named Frankie Figs (Michael Duncan) finds himself unwittingly helping, but he starts to fall in love with Cynthia and won't let her die.My plot description sounds quite bad, but the movie is very good and funny. The collection of actors in this movie are superb. Bruce Willis is good as the loveable murderer. Matthew Perry does a great comedic job as usual. Michael Duncan fit the part of the really big and scary hit man pretty well too. The adorable Amanda Peet was really good too as the hit-woman wannabe.I saw ANALYZE THIS a few days before I saw this, and I thought this one blew it away. The actors are better, the characters are cooler, the jokes are funnier (I was laughing out loud on many occasions) and the mixture of crime and comedy is pulled off a lot better in this movie, which is strange because there is more crime in this one than in ANALYZE THIS.

And what exactly was Kevin Pollack doing? Natacha Henstrige is nothing more then an mindless object of desire in this film- there is nothing behind her character.

93,mercury-26,recommend (though barely),7,1 March 2000,"There are a couple of performances that still bug me about Bruce Willis' new film, The Whole Nine Yards. There's enough good material here to recommend it, but let's dispense with the bad first: Rosanna Arquette and Kevin Pollack have certainly done better work; in fact, this is the worst I've ever seen them. The problem lies more in bad casting than the performances themselves. If you're wrong for the part, you're wrong for the part.
Our main character, `Oz' Oseransky (Matthew Perry), a dentist has inherited the gambling debt of his wife's ex-husband. His mother-in-law and wife Sophie (played with bad French accent by Rosanna Arquette), share mutual hate for Oz. Never explained is why he married her in the first place. She is entitled to none of his money unless he dies, but he's too good hearted a person to consider she would want to have him bumped off.Enter Jimmy `the Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis, perfectly cast in his best comedy role in years), who moves next door to Oz. He's not there to kill anyone, but to hide out of country (the film is set in Montreal) from the mob boss he used to kill people for, Janni (Kevin Pollack, accent unknown). Jimmy's just finished a five year prison sentence after ratting out several members of the gang, including the Janni's father, hence, putting Janni in charge of North Chicago's biggest crime family. Oz grew up in Chicago (go figure), so he knows all about The Tulip's career. He foolishly shares what he knows with Sophie, who wastes no time in convincing Oz to go to Chicago to find out if there's a price on Jimmy's head.This is only the beginning of this convoluted plot, which rolls together Oz, Jimmy, and Sophie with Janni's current triggerman Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), Oz's demented office assistant Jill (Amanda Peet), and Jimmy's beautiful, estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge). There are a few unexpected surprises in a plot where few people are what they seem.What holds this all together are the performances of Willis and Perry, a risky pairing that turned out well. Perry takes physical comedy to a level we haven't seen since Jim Carrey's heyday. Willis' timing is perfect. He gives this role, that of a good-natured psychopath, exactly what it needs. He was built for comedy and should do more of it (even though we'd all like to forget Hudson Hawk).David Franco's photography gives the film a noir look, using filters and dampened lighting in most shots. The look was chosen, I would guess, because this is a parody of the mystery/thriller genre. Director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny), knowing how sophisticated movie audiences have become, does his best to make the story interesting to look at. He also understands well how to frame a shot that's designed for laughs.Grade: B-",The Whole Nine Yards
94,robsellke,A decent comedy with witty humor and an interesting plot,8,24 July 2000,"First of all, I must say that a thought Matthew Perry was great in this film as Nicholas ""Oz"" Oseransky, the bumbling, good-guy dentist, who just wants to do the right thing.  Bruce Willis was also in a good role as Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, the ruthless Hungarian Mafia hitman.  Oz is a really funny character with a knack for trouble following him.  The movie starts out with Oz finding out that Jimmy ""The Tulip"" has moved in next door.  Oz is scared out of his mind and wants to move  away, but his ""charming"" wife Sophie has something else planned for him.  Sophie tells Oz to go to Yanni Gogolack in Chicago, a Hungarian mobster with a score to settle with Jimmy, and rat out Jimmy's whereabouts to Yanni.  Of course, everything goes awry and the plot twists and turns in a hundred directions, until the rather predictable, yet decent ending.

The script is a disaster.  I'd lay odds that if you read the script, you'd find very few jokes.  It's as if the writer was just writing down whatever came to mind and thought ""When Matthew Perry says it, it'll be funny."" Friends is not the best sitcom on TV, but it has much better writing than this movie.None of the acting was impressive at all.  Bruce Willis was nicely understated, but he can't be said to have accomplished much, because he had so little to work with.  The plot was contrived, the romance angle was laughable!!  Not funny, but pathetic.  The couples meet, have sex, fall in love, and get married in the space of, what, couple days at the most.

To make a fair determination let me first count the factors I am sure that I did observe and weigh these in the balance before passing final judgement. First off I'll list the detracting qualities: Contrived slapstick(Perry's manic energy in most places just doesn't feel real), cartoonish TV sitcom acting job from the protagonist,the worst attempt at a foreign accent on screen since ""Robin Hood""(Arquette), and finally to be kind I'll omit several more and leave this as the final negative- the most unlikely romantic pairing seen since ""Heavy""(Perry and Henstridge).

It's obvious from the tone of the movie that there'll be a happy ending, but how it could possibly come about is revealed through an intricate series of plot twists.Okay, so there are a few onscreen killings (hey, it's a movie about hit men!), but the exploding blood packs are thankfully absent.

Of course, it helps that the film is well cast, at least in the cases of Willis, Perry, Duncan, and Peet (luckily, they're the four characters with the most screen time) - Pollak and Arquette seem disinterested in their characters and deliver poor accents.Expect most of the film's laughs to stem from the conversations between Willis, Perry, and Peet as most of the physical humor is pretty ordinary genre fare.  Incidentally, a lot of the jokes are fairly subtle (an aspect of the film I like), so be aware.  Also, there's some good quotables here. Granted, you probably won't want to watch this movie more than once, but there's enough jokes here to make it worth a viewing. 7/10",The Whole Nine Yards
103,NJtoTX,The definition of Uneven,7,29 July 2001,"This film tries to be a lot. It tries to be a serious tongue-in-cheek comedy with characters alternating between serious and over-the-top. It attempts to mix thriller with Three Stooges. It takes Matthew Perry and makes him clueless, but the next minute it makes him Clouseau. It brings to mind many different films, from Analyze This to Airplane, but not reaching the heights of any. One mob character (Kevin Pollack) says (nearly) all his V's as W's and all his W's as V's. My 16-year old thinks this is hilarious; it is why he wanted me to see the film, which is now a favorite of his. ""Wermin"" sends him to the floor. Okay... Of course, he also likes the bare breasts in the window.The film succeeds in small bits, fails in long stretches. Bruce Willis is fine as the neighbor with a past who may be a loose cannon. Rosanna Arquette has been dinged heavily by other reviewers here, but her histrionics fit fine in this mishmash. She is like the scheming couple in Steve Martin's All of Me; the overacting passion is by design. If you're in a giddy mood and don't want to see a good film and don't have a preconception about Perry, it's an okay waste of an evening.

He is so funny as the only really innocent guy among all those mafia people. He gets into hilarious situations and made everybody in the theater laugh very very hard. Bruce Willis is also great! Second, there is an amazing script. Plot turns which nobody would guess and a funny story with dialogue that is just so incredibly funny!

Gangster Michael Clarke Duncan betrays his co-workers and his organization for his long term friend and colleague, Bruce Willis. He stands by Bruce when everyone else is against him, he puts everything he has on the line to help him, and he proves that he's willing to kill and die, without a second thought, for him.Annoying dentist Matthew Perry, on the other hand, knows Willis for one day and is already willing to sell him out to the people who want to kill him. He has sex with Bruce's wife, which of course is considered an immediate death penalty offense to anyone in that world. He also proves, beyond a doubt that, if a minimal amount of pressure is applied, he'd be willing to tell all he knows to anyone who would listen. Whether it would be the FBI, other gangsters or a jury of his peers, if they intimidate him, Matthew will doubtlessly betray Bruce.So, of the long term true and loyal friend and fellow contract killer, or the whiny dentist who he just met and who immediately proves himself to be a multi-level rat, which one do you think Bruce Willis shoots, in order to save the other? This film is worthwhile for Roseanne Arquette's over the top, barely recognizable performance. I didn't even realize she was in the movie until the closing credits, and then I had to think for a minute before I figured out which character she played. Amanda Peet as the topless, gun wielding hit-woman wanna be also shouldn't be missed. However, you might wish that Kevin Pollack had gone to dental school, instead of taking up acting and torturing us with that grating, excruciating pseudo-lisp.

108,thomas196x2000,This is supposed to be fun?,3,30 June 2009,"There ARE a few laughs here and there, and Matt Perry TRIES to squeeze some comedic juice out of this, but it's hard going.The characters are all either too cool, along the lines of the characters in another terrible film ""Get Shorty"", or they are over the top phony, as in the police inspectors in this movie. Those two guys act like they are in an amateur youtube movie.Willis falls into the former category. He is so cool in this film I think he is 1/2 asleep. If you could phone in a physical performance, he'd have done so. You could have propped him on on a stool, the same stool, and just moved the backgrounds around. In fact, they may have done that.It's nice seeing Henstridge in here, but her efforts are wasted as well. I will agree with other posters that Arquette and her lousy accent are just irritating. But for me, the worst offender, by far, is Amanda Peet, in her wannabe hit girl character.I have seen her in other films and she didn't strike me this way. But in this film, her mugging, her posturing and her yapping is so distracting I really, really hoped that she would get shot in this film. (It wouldn't be surprising, this is the kind of film where characters are always aiming a gun at someone and then at the last moment turning to shoot someone else--an overused trick in bad cinema that needs to stop).I haven't seen someone show so much teeth since Denise Richards' bizarre non-stop smilefest in ""Starship Troopers"". ""Ha ha ha, I love how you shot that guy, and killing the other guy was pure art!"" Ha ha ha, more teeth and more goofy posturing.Pollock is totally wasted. Here's a guy who can do practically anything and is reduced to babbling and, I think, confusing Ws with Vs or something--nevermind, not important and I couldn't really get it anyway.If you like black comedy mob pictures that aren't funny, don't have engaging characters, action limited to shooting a few characters at close range, the lead character trying to bring in a little slapstick, and a bizarre ""happy ending"", here's the film for you.

109,daneldorado,A most enjoyable bit of nonsense,8,27 July 2010,"After waiting for years to watch the caper movie ""The Whole Nine Yards"" (2000), I finally got the chance and was very amused by the film, in spite of the many complications that could exist only in a screenwriter's fevered imagination, not in real life.That, I think, may be one reason the film was made. It makes no sense; NONE... and yet, director Jonathan Lynn -- who also helmed one of the best comedies of the 1990s, ""My Cousin Vinny"" -- somehow made this amoral, farcical exercise in tough yucks memorable and funny.One reason this merry melange works is suggested in Roger Ebert's review. Ebert, the dean of American film critics, wrote:""We suspect that the actors are barely suppressing giggles. This is the kind of standard material everyone could do in lockstep, but you sense inner smiles, and you suspect the actors are enjoying themselves.""Consider the basic plot. Nick Oseransky -- known affectionately as Oz and played by Matthew Perry -- is a straight-arrow dentist, living in a Montreal suburb with his insufferable French-Canadian wife Sophie (Roseanne Arquette), who not-so-secretly wants her husband dead. Oz, saddled with a bad marriage and huge debts, doesn't need any more stress in his life. So, naturally, here comes more trouble -- in the presence of a professional hit-man, Jimmy Tudeski (Bruce Willis), who moves in next door.The plot snowballs from there, with Oz going to Chicago (at Sophie's insistence) to rat out Tudeski to his former mob acquaintances (for a ""finder's fee""), while at the same time his faithless wife is alerting the mob to whack Oz, so she can collect on his life insurance. Meanwhile, Oz' dental assistant, a beauty named Jill (Amanda Peet), salivates at the thought of meeting a real hit man, for she is attracted to their exciting lifestyle and may want to become a professional hit (wo)man herself someday. She meets Jimmy and tells him of the ongoing double-cross, and he takes her in as his assistant.Meanwhile, in Chicago, Oz meets not only the mob boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), but also Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), a tall beauty who is being held hostage by the Gogolak gang. For no discernible reason other than to keep the plot moving, Oz falls head over heels in love with the statuesque Cynthia. One of the film's funniest lines comes when Oz and Cynthia prepare to go to bed together.She says: ""Be gentle, will you? I haven't made love in five years.""His response: ""Neither have I. (pause.) I've been married.""In a thriller/comedy/farce like this, you can expect dozens of interlocking plot strands and several comic pratfalls... and that's just what you get.In an inspired moment, Jimmy fends off a gang of hoods out to get him by stationing a very naked Jill at the front window. As the gunmen stop and drool at this sudden distraction, Jimmy opens fire, killing all but one of them. Jill then coolly dispatches the last guy, who's still transfixed by the vision of her gorgeous body.After the carnage, Jimmy calmly says to Jill: ""Okay, you can get dressed now.""If you think I've given you all the spoilers in this lethal farce, disabuse yourself of that notion immediately. I've just skimmed the surface. There are many other comical moments, especially those involving Oz' faithless wife Sophie and the very large hit man Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is the size of an oak tree but, in the end, doesn't know where to pledge his allegiance. You'll have to see it to find out.And, although ""The Whole Nine Yards"" involves a lot of homicide, some of it justifiable and some not, it treats the whole killing spree like a big joke. The subject is dead serious, of course. But the cast isn't taking it seriously, they are having a ball with this material. So will you.Comments to: daneldorado93@yahoo.com",The Whole Nine Yards

Definitely worth 100 minutes of your time.Bruce Willis is decent, Michael Clarke Duncan is good, Matt Perry is good (especially as he isn't simply recreating his Friends persona), Amanda Peet performs well (with an interesting way of, well, distracting, shall we say, the villains), whilst Rosanna Arquette and Natasha Henstridge are slightly wasted in their roles.One point though.

He stars as Oz, a dentist living in a quiet area of Canada, with his bitchy wife (Rosanna Arquette, who puts on a strange French accent). One day he sees some moving vans next door, and a familiar-looking man is giving orders. When Oz approaches him, it turns out to be hitman Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). From that point on, Oz gets tangled in strange goings-on. He goes to Chicago to tell people of Jimmy's whereabouts, but it doesn't go very well. He meets Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge, erasing all memory of Species), the estranged wife of Jimmy, whom he falls in love with, Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan, surprisingly poor after his superb turn in The Green Mile)and Claire (Amanda Peet) along the way.

116,gbrumburgh-1,"As the title indicates, this palpable comedy is a funny-bone short of a first down.",5,20 September 2001,"`The Whole Nine Yards' just doesn't go the distance.  Short of a first down, it never gets close to scoring a touchdown.  In fact, it barely has enough kick for a field goal.  Cracking a smile here and there, it's one of those run-of-the mill comedies you forget the minute the clock runs out.The lead performances are efficient but smack of déjà vu.  By now Bruce Willis has a patent on the cool, smirking, know-it-all tough guy and he barely lifts a finger here to do anything effortful.  You know his game. And though he has top billing as an infamous contract killer on the lam, he pretty much passes the ball to Matthew Perry, in typical sheepish form, as an innocent dentist by trade who, goaded by a greedy, acrimonious wife, gets caught up in new neighbor Willis' murder-for-hire imbroglio.  Granted, we've seen THIS Perry many times on TV (his comedy bag of tricks is littered with little 'Chandler'-isms), but he is still an undeniably talented and appealing actor.  Somehow Perry manages to hustle on the field a bit, pulling off some great (if not always fresh) physical schtick and reaction shots along the way.   He is the comedy quarterback in this film.But while Perry and (to a lesser extent) Willis front the team decently enough, the featured cast comes off more like bench-warmers than players -- supportive but ineffectual.  A tightly-coiled Kevin Pollak as Willis' `brutal' nemesis carefully toys with his eyebrow to establish his character's menace and that's about the extent of it.  The usually interesting and offbeat Rosanna Arquette is jarringly ineffective and annoying as all get out as Perry's nasty, ungrateful Gallic spouse anticipating the joys of widowhood.  Her talent for comedy is suspect here and highly questionable too is her attempt at a foreign accent (ditto Pollak).  Michael Clarke Duncan, who was so poignant in `The Green Mile,' has yet to find an equally rewarding part, finding himself typed yet again as a looming behemoth.  Though his henchman gets to play both sides of the war zone, his role is pittance and adds little to stir up the proceedings. Natasha Henstridge starts off promisingly as a femme fatale type, but her character quickly turns to jelly and peters out by film's end.  Amanda Peet's idea of comedy is to use a lot of overt facial gestures, mugging shamelessly throughout.  Memorable more for her gratuitous topless scenes, at least she and Henstridge fill the bill as fetching eye candy.Director Jonathan Lynn's comedy record has been rather mediocre thus far -- some hits (`My Cousin Vinny'), some misses (`Sgt. Bilko'), mostly errors (`Clue').  Add this to the list of errors.  The gags tend to strain for laughs, the set-ups are frequently pat, predictable and calculated, and the situation covers old ground (1979's `The In-Laws' starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin).  After a somewhat diverting first half, the story dries up, running out of clever maneuvers.  I'd say a passable time-filler at most.However, if you are a Matthew Perry fan, get out the popcorn, the beer and the pennant because he IS the entire game.",The Whole Nine Yards
117,Rumples-2,"Simple, engaging, fun",7,4 December 2000,"I expected little from this film and was very pleasantly surprised. Matthew Perry is fairly effective in a fairly typical role (the next WASP Woody Allen) as a neurotic good-hearted bumbler, Bruce Willis is almost as effective at comedy as action movies (which is to say, more than adequate without threatening startling brilliance), Natasha Henstridge is always a total hottie so little acting is required, the supporting cast all quite good (although Rosanna Arquette is almost - though I suspect deliberately - unbearablly bad).

So even as hilarity is erupting you still are conscious of a sense of menace that makes the goofiness somehow even goofier.Roseanna Arquette also deserves kudos as Perry's wife. She does a an excellent job of portraying someone you really do not like and really would not want to be married to.I originally saw this in the theater at full price and felt I got my money's worth.

This is an entertaining movie with some funny skits, but it isn't really for all audiences, primarily because most of the characters in the movie are ""hit men"" and trying to kill each other. The fact that a policeman actually was killed during the mêlée of hit men killing each other is something that I wish had not been in the story - but to be fair, I've watched the movie twice and the first time I watched it (probably in 2000), I didn't think anything about the policeman being killed.",The Whole Nine Yards

Amanda Peet also does a good job as Jill, the contract killer in training.Now, this isn't exactly an extremely deep movie that's really thought provoking, and there are some aspects of the plot that I find a bit unbelievable (some stuff involving Jimmy's wife...I won't spoil it).

The stage is set justifiably for the actors that make the best work in the movie, Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet and Michael Clarke Duncan besides Perry. It is a comedy, yes, but very subtle, and keeping with the realistic even when the characters, or Perry's Oseransky, mostly, find themselves in absurd situations, and the plot keeps turning until the end, when it reaches a classic 50's-like tone.

So when Jimmy the Tulip (Bruce Willis), a hitman hiding out from a Chicago gang whose leader he killed shows up next door, Sophie Oseransky (Rosanna Arquette) suggests that her husband go to Chicago, rat Jimmy out, and see if he can collect a finder's fee.  But she really wants him dead, so as she as he leaves, she pays a visit to Jimmy and tells him the whole story. Fortunately, Jimmy has a plan too - he's going to let Oz rat him out, and lay in wait for the gang to come after him.  However, the whole thing gets significantly more tangled along the way.The Whole Nine Yards is incredibly funny from start to finish, with a great neurotic performance from Matthew Perry (even if it's identical to all his others) and terrific comedic/straight performances from Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan.

Throw in some tedious plot about gangsters killing each other and the truly unlikely idea of Natasha Henstridge falling for Perry and what emerges is an over-long sub-Sopranos crime comedy-thriller with no thrills and no discernible jokes.The problem is with Perry, really. He is rightly praised for his role in Friends, where he is both charming and genuinely funny. Unfortunately, this film uses all the least funny and least charming aspects of  Chandler, namely, his slapstick shtick and gormless loser routines. As a stinging wit, he is very good - here, he is forced to play the straight man to Willis's grinning hitman and it just doesn't work. This is isn't just a bad film, but an unforgivable waste of talent and promise as well.",The Whole Nine Yards
132,willow-46,They should put Crime before Comedy in the genre section,7,26 May 2000,"This is a pretty good film, I have to say. But it's strange why people say it's a comedy. It is funny, of course, but nearly all the jokes were not even related to the plot. They are mostly people-tripped-over kind of joke. Otherwise the movie is fine. Matthew Perry's role is a bit like Chandler on Friend's, and he's just as cute. Amanda Peet is also  good , and she has the most interesting character I think.Basically the story is great. It sees into the heart of the hit man-which he happens to have one. And it's weird how a person could murder people but thinks it's a sin to have a divorce. But it has a happy ending, so that didn't bother me too much.",The Whole Nine Yards

Thank whoever for Mr Wapner and Mr Lynn for bringing this to the screen.'The Whole Nine Yards' was a light yet fun film who made being a hitman more like a viable career option than an immoral murderous activity. The plot was easy to follow and Willis proved he could make fun of his hard-man roles. Matthew Perry also shows a flair for slapstick and plays comedy well away from the awful froth that is 'Friends'.A nice waste of a couple of hours. Recommended but not for the more moral and uptight amongst us.,The Whole Nine Yards

I felt like I was staring at a piece of cardboard watching this. Bruce Willis is a great actor but he couldn't save how awfully unfunny this movie was. I forgot I was watching a comedy half way through and I said to myself ""wait aren't I supposed to be laughing?"". Another thing that just didn't do it for me was that Mathew Perry is just Chandler... again. I think he suffers from the same fate as many other Tv stars that just are forever stuck in one roll.",The Whole Nine Yards

Rosanna Arquette really pulled off a good role too.  Basically, I couldn't find anything about this movie I didn't like.  I could only give it an 8 though.  A comedy has to be a real classic for me to give it more than an 8.  Natasha what's her name was not a good choice for Perry's love interest, but she's so fine, who cares.  I suppose if they didn't have her, it would have been too jokey.  The story line was actually put together well for a goof ball movie.  Switching the teeth was a great twist.

The moment I knew that this was a good movie was when I no longer saw him as Chandler but as Oz.This movie is not a laugh a minute.  But it is without a doubt a giggle a minute with a few fall down laughs.  It is cute and funny and somehow makes hitmen lovable. The cast is well put together even though Kevin Pollack's little speech impediment is a tad annoying.  Yet the cast meshes regardless.  And if you don't cheer when OZ gets the girl (I will not reveal which one) you might have lost some mirth in your heart.  Maybe this movie will help bring it back.",The Whole Nine Yards

The physical humor is funny, but it's the dialog that really sets this movie apart. Many of the lines are subtilely funny - they sneak up on you. You're laughing at them during the movie and you are laughing at them again after the movie.Bruce Willis displays his versatility with a performance that brought back memories of Moonlighting, Matthew Perry is also good. Natasha Henstridge is very good as the tough (but not so tough) wife of Bruce Willis.

A fairly good cast, with Willis as the really cool guy, and a fairly good story that in itself guarantees for a lot of laughs.

There're two gorgeous women to occupy your time, but when one of them is shown topless, it's hard not to see this as being just plain gratuitous. I don't want to give away the situation, but there were much less dangerous ways to distract someone.

It's been a long time since I saw a comedy for the last time which was made for an audience which already left high school. There are a lot of teenager comedies around and some of them are even quite good (like American Pie I + II). But this film is for those who left their teenage years behind and know what it means to be on the job and to be married (Cynthia: ""I haven't made love in five years."" -- Oz: ""Neither have I. I've been married."").It's an intelligent Comedy. Good story, great acting and real ""Hawks'ish"" Dialogues. And the characters are ""Hawks' Comedies alike"".If you are at least 30 years old and still love to laugh, this film is a ""must"" for you.

Here he plays Chandler Bing under the name of Nicholas ""Oz"" Oseransky. He is also a dentist here, which he isn't on ""Friends"", but he can't fool me! I can spot Chandler a mile away, and there he was, only several feet from me. The same sarcasm, the occasional stutterring (""W-why? Why? Why?""), and the legendary ""Oh My God"" were all there pointing and Mr. Bing. The only difference between here and there is that he doesn't crack jokes. Well, you wouldn't either, if you were in his position. If you love him on ""Friends"", see this movie for an extra two hours of Chandler, with different friends.And of course, there was Bruce Willis, charmingly funny as he always is (""Die Hard"", ""Hudson Hawk""), absolutely born for the part.Bottom line: It's worth a movie ticket, it's worth the rental, and it's definitely worth two hours of watching it on TV!",The Whole Nine Yards

Michael Clarke Duncan was terrific. And this was one of Bruce Willis's better movies. Many have complained about Rosanna Arquette -- her performance was a bit over-the-top, but in the main I enjoyed it, especially in the police station. And Matthew Perry was very good too. And the running jokes about his marriage and his beeper were funny. I wasn't happy with the plot twist that made it imperative for Jimmy to kill Cynthia rather than divorce her -- quite illogical.

It's got mobsters involved in a convoluted plot to kill each other to walk away with a fortune, star-crossed lovers who really just want to be together and make it out of a bad situation alive.  But everything is twisted around as if the script made a trip to the Twilight Zone first.  The thing is... TW9Y is actually a pretty good, faithful to the genre film noir.  The main character (Matthew Perry) is a hapless *dentist* who's evil wife wants him dead.  The fact that he's a dentist ends up making a difference, getting him out of an otherwise intractable situation.  The femme fatale (Natasha Hentsridge) really isn't, though she looks that way.  Jill (Amanda Peet) is a perky receptionist, who happens to have a ""thing"" for, of all things, contract killers.  Bruce Willis is, as usual, excellent.  Kevin Pollack's role as gang boss Janni Gogalac is just priceless.  You can almost see him busting up in the scene when he gives his monologue to Perry's character with the nearly incomprehensible accent.  ""Wermin"" indeed.  I hope the cast really had a good time making this movie (since they didn't really make any money :).  Setting the movie in Montreal was brilliant, lending an interesting, a little bit exotic tinge to the whole thing that enhances the ""slightly off"" nature of the movie.  Canada's close to the USA but as anyone who's been there can tell you, it's NOT the USA.  On the DVD, the director notes that this was done for reasons of economy (Montreal is MUCH cheaper than Miami, which was the first choice) but ended up really affecting the entire film.",The Whole Nine Yards

This was a very funny movie once it got going.  The first half hour was somewhat slow and I think that Kevin Pollak's entire character was very half baked and dumb.  The ensemble is excellent especially Michael Clarke Duncan having a great time as another mob hitman.  Jonathan Lynn's comedies have never really struck me as hilarious, I was not a big fan of either Greedy or My Cousin Vinny, but he has made a winner here.  Although I am a huge fan of Matthew Perry's Friends role, I found him a tad grating at times here, but still very funny. Bruce Willis underplays nicely but the star of the show is Amanda Peet.  The lively, funny newcomer throws herself into a scene-stealing role, hell a MOVIE-STEALING role.  She is bright funny, likable and talented.

Yes, she is a beautiful girl, but the channel I watched the movie on didn't show the completely nude scenes, anyway, so all I can judge is the character she played and not my own fantasies.The giddiness when meeting Tudeski for the first time, the arched eyebrows when asking Cynthia ""you do?"" when Cynthia says she loves Oz, the flip of her wrist when she summons the bank man back into his cubicle, the leg lock around Tudeski at the dock...how could anyone not like this girl?

At last, a movie that has MADE IN CANADA written all over it, a movie that is proud to be filmed in Canada. I hadn't seen that in a long time. As you probably know, lots of movies -american movies- are currently filmed in Canada, simply because of generous tax incentives. What you might not know is that Americans are getting angry because the phenomenon is getting more and more important. California assemblyman Scott Wildman recently said: ""One television series pumps $75 million in wages, taxes, pension funds and other economic activity into California's economy. But we get nothing if it's done in Canada."" (quoted from Tribute magazine) And a movie that's openly made in Canada, not even trying to hide, shouting: ""Hey, America is way to expensive, but you know what? We're going to make it anyway! Get me a plane ticket to Canada, will you?"" I get the feeling somebody's going to be mad.So, ""Blame Canada! Blame Canada!"" Sounds familiar, doesn't it?Anyway, back to the actual movie.

This movie is similar to Gun Shy, a rather overlooked film, which had me laughing harder, but the plot fell apart toward the end.  This movie keeps a steady plot and the constant question in your mind over who's going to backstab who.If kids can grasp the concept of what a hitman is (and the mob..ehmm I mean the organization), this is a funny movie to take them to.

This is possible Willis' worst movie to date.  I hated it, it was so incredibly bad that I wanted to walk out.  The lame comedy got so old, and tired so fast.  Perry's jumpy Jim Carrey-wannabe attitude made me sick.  I can't say anything positive about this movie.  And the fact that they brought nudity into the movie made it even worse.  You can't bring something into a movie that doesn't belong in that movie.  And, you can't mix crime, romance, and comedy in one.  It doesn't work.  The love story was also pathetic.  The fact that Perry and Henstridge fell in love within the first 10 minutes of meeting eachother was stupid, especially that they actually felt it.  This movie was a HUGE waste of time for me.

Some of the deliveries in the script are pretty funny and the whole situation built up around 'the tulip' (one of the main characters - portrayed by Willis) is very nicely depicted throughout the movie.

The script is sharp and the humour is surprisingly intelligent with some great punchlines as well as some hilarious moments provided by the great cast. I usually hate hysterical characters but Matthew Perry shows that he is a reliable leading actor playing the extremely nervous Oz. Bruce Willis, who is always great, may perhaps not deliver the best performance of his career but he is nevertheless a fully credible lead. But this film belongs to it's supporting actresses. Rosanna Arquette is overacting a bit but she still delivers a memorable portrait of Sophie, Perry's bitchy wife from hell with the most horrible accent imaginable. But the real gems of this film is Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet who both deliver great performances. Peet's performance has Oscar-potential. Not only is she really good but the Academy usually like offbeat supporting roles. Catherine Keener in Being John Malkovich is good example. Amanda Peet's performance has also been critically adored which is also a good sign. Said shortly, The Whole Nine Yards is a really good (if not tremendous) movie with some minor flaws. For example, reliable actors like Michael Duncan Clarke and Kevin Pollak are both far from as good as they could have been. Still, this movie has enough assets to be worth watching at the cinema.",The Whole Nine Yards
173,Mr.Movies,This is one great movie!,7,13 March 2000,I loved this comedy.   Bruce Willis was great.   He made me think of Moonlighting and Die Hard again.   He should focus his attention more on these kind of roles.   He's a natural.   The other actors in this are well cast also.    I even liked Matthew Perry and I don't really care for him that much as an actor.   Michael Clarke Duncan was a joy to watch and has some of the funniest stuff.    Go see this movie and take someone with you. 7 out of 10 and leaning toward an 8.,The Whole Nine Yards

175,robertasburyrussell,A polished gem,8,14 May 2021,"Rewatching this film for the first time in over a decade, I found it even more charming and well-crafted than I remembered. The four main actors - Perry, Willis, Peet & Henstridge - never overplay their parts but imbue them with personality. Perry's physical humor is laugh-out-loud funny in places, all the more for his subtle timing. The plot is tight enough to keep the suspense building while the comedy allows the characters come across as human and interesting as opposed to caricatures. While the director received more praise and success for some of his other movies, like Clue & My Cousin Vinny, The Whole Nine Yards is a more mature and, to me, more gratifying film.",The Whole Nine Yards

It's easy to picture them cracking up in take after take while trying to deliver their lines with a straight face, and the fun is infectious (at least it was for me.)Bruce Willis is great as Jimmy the Tulip, and Kevin Pollack is a riot as the head of a Hungarian crime family.Go, see, enjoy.",The Whole Nine Yards

The laughs just keep coming, I've seen it 3 times and each time I pick up something new that's funny.  Everything from odd almost un-noticeable sound effects added to the hilarity.  This movie was excellent.  The character Yanni Gogolack had to have been one of the funniest I've seen ( my fadder, vimmy, wormen) all lines from the eyebrow massaging leader of the Gogolack gang.  Matthew Perry's character Oz Oseransky was funny at how he was so nervous of Jimmy the Tulip and pretty much every mafia man.  Just mentioning the name Harland Williams makes you want to see it, although not a large part, it doesn't mean that it's not as funny as the others.

In this case, the character of Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky is a struggling dentist that is in debt due to his former and now expired partner (and father-in-law) as well as his wife and mother-in-law.Bruce Willis plays, as he is billed, a charismatic hitman in Jimmy ""the Tulip"" Tudeski.  Jimmy T's out of jail and in hiding, to an extent.  He's refused to be in the Witness Protection Program and has gone on his own to the Montreal Suburbs to start a new life.Only his old one gets in the way.Light-Hearted and yet dark in scope, ""The Whole Nine Yards"" is a mixed bag in how viewers feel about the movie.  I find the film entertaining and enjoy most of what I see with a few flaws but it's still a more-than-enjoyable flick.  Others find the film boring and dull and a dud as a comedy.

Opportunities to turn into a darker fargo-esque/pulp-fiction-esque caper were not taken.

Bruce Willis is superb, Matthew Perry is good, and Duncan is as big and imposing as always. Females in the movie are beautiful, and Henstridge's beauty is simply stunning.

Frightened Matthew Perry, frightening Michael Duncan and charming Bruce Willis - all at their best. Definitely top comedy of the year, and probably top of all times.Poor, unhappily married dentist (Perry) lives in Quebec, which he hates, because they put mayonnaise to hamburgers. One day there appears a new neighbor - Jimmy ""The Tulip"" - just released from prison top hit man of the world. After that action starts moving really fast. Hungarian mafia wars, everybody's killing each other and right in the middle - the dentist with suicidal tendencies.Believe it or not, but the plot is actually good. It might suit a non-comedy film. The whole thing is about humor, though. Incredibly natural and charming jokes are of the highest quality. And fragile Perry put aside of huge Duncan is simply an unmissable view. Adding to all that, apprentice killer - Amanda Peet - with a delightful smile and huge amounts of spare energy.This movie is the second, next to There's Something About Mary, top comedy of all times.

The characters that were supposed to be likable were and the ones that were supposed to be despicable were too. I know a lot of people will say that the plot was thin or the script was weak, but IT""S A COMEDY and it does a great job of being just that.Amanda Peet steals the show in nearly every scene that she is in. The ""Jack and Jill"" star somehow manages to be beautiful and wacky and intelligent all at the same time. Bruce Willis continues to show that he can act in any genre, although I still think that this edgy comedy style (remember Moonlighting) is his best. Matthew Perry has an impeccable sense of comic timing and physical comedy. Here he shows that he is the ""Friends"" male most likely to break from the pack. Natasha Henstridge gives the most impressive performance that I have seen from her so far and, by the way, she is stone cold gorgeous.Overall, this was the most enjoyable comedy I have seen this year. I loved the little twists and the romantic story was cute. It is certainly not the most important film of the new millennium, but it's not trying to be. It's trying to make you laugh and for me it succeeded just about every time. As I've said before, when you're watching a comedy like this, try to lighten up and enjoy the ride.",The Whole Nine Yards

The story is impossible, but the truly bothering part of this movie is Matthew Perry's lack of ablilty to remember where his hands were for each shot.  One second they are in his lap and the next camera angle, they are on his hips, and it happens throughout the entire film. This isn't something that I even notice, and I am a HUGE fan of FRIENDS and his part played on FRIENDS (which, in this movie, they should have just called him Chandler).  The continuity department fails us, but worse of Perry fails us with his ""Chandler falls down again and again"" performance.",The Whole Nine Yards

Three To Tango is a very close 2nd. Not only is he perfect for this movie, but he does everything perfectly in it. His body language, physical comedy, and general acting abilities are at it's peak as far as I'm concerned.Bruce Willis was easily the best man for the job. He has an incredible way of being extremely intimidating and can go on a killing spree in movies for no reason, yet we still want him to live (doesn't matter if he's good or bad). Am I the only one who didn't want him to die in The Jackal? He's the second funniest guy in this movie and hitman persona comes through in fine style.Although Michael Clark Duncan was perfect as the bodyguard/hitman of Yanni's, we still wanted him to live, right? Like Bruce Willis, he can go around killing good/bad people, but we'd still bring him over for to see Mom, right? He played his smaller role very well and he should be proud of his work (even though he didn't get too many lines).Funniest Whole Nine Yards moment: Oz sees Jimmy T and he tries to flee, but gets stopped by Figgs. He then falls over a nearby lamp and ""wets"" himself. A MUST BUY MOVIE!",The Whole Nine Yards

If you said yes to both those questions then The Whole Nine Yards is the movie for you! Unfortunately the film is not the smart, intriguing comedy that the previews set it up as.  The film does have two high points, namely Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan who do a commendable job portraying contract-killers. Unfortunately the rest of the cast does not bring the same charisma to the movie and Matthew Perry in particular is extremely disappointing in the lead role.  The Whole Nine Yards tries to be too many things: comedy, mystery, romance and action.  Instead of being a quality film in one of those genres it tries to hard to combine the four and winds up faltering.  If you went into this movie and didn't know what it was about, there's a good chance you could enjoy parts of it, but if you expect an intelligent comedy you will be sorely disappointed.",The Whole Nine Yards

It did, he did, but Matthew Perry was hilarious - well worth seeing just for his performance.  Amanda Peet was also a nice surprise. She was almost stealing scenes from Mr. Perry.  I had a little trouble getting by a few of the accents that some characters obviously took out of the closet for this film.  When you know the actors well enough, its distracting to wonder whether its working or not.  I think its because I expect them to forget to use it at any given point.  Aside from that, the characters were good throughout, right down to the two detectives investigating the crime. There were a few uneven spots with the dialog, but it was much tighter and more consistent than a recent gangster and his newfound buddy flick, ""Analyze This"".  There are some movies that we like to see over again to pick up the subtleties, and everything else that we missed when we were laughing.  This is one of them.",The Whole Nine Yards

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie--at least what I saw before the film platter fell off right at the climax (Doh!) and I was handed my free pass to another showing.  (I can't wait for digital projection!)  Willis is as likeable as ever, even as a murderer (hit man) of 17 people.  Thankfully, Perry's usual awkwardness is not overplayed.  Peet is adorably corny.  Henstridge is sultry.  Duncan, Williams, Arquette, and Pollak are all excellent in their supporting roles. The movie provides non-stop action and humor and is not gratuitously violent.

208,sfarmer76,"B+ Movie, A-List Cast",8,27 February 2000,"B+ Movie, A-List CastPros: Excellent Physical Comedy, Funny Most of the Time...Cons: Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Pollack detract from movie.I went to see this movie because Bruce Willis was so great in ""The Sixth Sense."" He's pulled off action and dramatic roles with great flair before, so I wondered if he could make me laugh on purpose, rather than unintentionally, as he did when he played Korben Dallas in ""The Fifth Element.""The movie is directed rather handily by Jonathan Lynn, known mostly for early 90s comedy hits such as ""Three Men and a Little Lady"" (Ted Danson, Tom Selleck), and ""Greedy"" (Michael J. Fox, Kirk Douglas). Again he does an admirable job with essentially the same kind of a film, your basic fish out of water movie that pairs two or more established male leads, one from TV, one from film.Matthew Perry is likable here, in certainly his best role outside of TVs Friends. Here he plays hen-pecked ""Oz"" Oseranksy, a Montreal dentist that is threatened by a turn of events after Mafia rubout artist Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski (Willis) moves in next door. Perry is so good with the physical comedy, that at times I almost thought he was in an entirely different movie. Then again, for a few scenes, and in broad strokes, you might have thought he was playing an alien.Willis comes across here much as he did in Moonlighting -- a wiseguy with the occassional good quip that appears to be losing his edge -- only this time he's a semi-retired hitman with trouble looking for him. So, aside from the hitman part, Willis is essentially playing himself. That's okay, you can still like him!While ""The Whole Nine Yards"" pretty much capitalizes on everything it has going for it, it falls flat a few times. ""The Whole Nine Yards"" desperately wants to be a cross between ""Get Shorty"" (plot within a plot) and ""Grosse Point Blank"" (amiable hitman makes good), but some of the gags are trite, and the dialogue doesn't always come off right.For example, I was mostly just annoyed by characters that talked funny... such as Rossana Arquette's Quebec Housewife Sophie Oseransky, and Kevin Pollack's Chi-Town Gangster Yanni. Talking funny and being funny are not the same thing, and I was mostly appalled that the great Arquette (Baby It's You, New York Stories, Pulp Fiction) has been reduce to playing cheap characters that are the butt of the joke in every scene, just for inconsequential laughs.On a happier note, Natasha Henstridge is more three-dimensional in her characterization here, as Jimmy Tudeski's soon to be ex-wife-on-the-outs, than I have ever seen her. And I can't say enough good things about the totally hilarious Amanda Peet (Jill)! Ms. Peet is certainly an up-and-comer, and I can't wait to see her in the movies ""Body Shots"" & ""Takedown"" which haven't been released yet.If you want to see another movie like this one, I'd have to compare it to movies like ""So, I Married An Axe-Murderer"", ""The Cable Guy"", ""Addicted to Love"", ""Election"" or ""Very Bad Things"", four other GREAT fish out of water comedies, and one BAD ONE from the 1990s. ""The Whole Nine Yards"" is, for the most part, almost a first down in every scene, but the movie tries too hard to make you laugh sometimes, and at topics that aren't very laughable, such as murder and death.So basically, to sum up, except for six or seven scenes where the ball metaphorically falls just a few inches short of the chain, you should get a kick out of this film.

216,SourCream,Underrated Comedy,10,18 November 2002,"At the time I had watched this film, I wasn't big into Willis or Perry, in fact I purchased the DVD because it was on sale and it was recommended as a `good laugh.' I had no idea that it would be as entertaining as it was. Jonathan Lynn had put together a wonderful cast, Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Amanda Peet, Natasha Henstridge, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clark-Duncan, and Kevin Pollak. It seemed the chemistry between Perry and Willis was glorified on film. Lynn managed to combine these characters, a `loser' we always seem to love, and a hit man we also always seem to love, into a great film where we want both ""good"" guys to become triumphant in the end.However few films have two stars of such opposite nature that blend so well. The rest of the cast had such uniqueness about them; finding out Peet is an out of work assassin herself, Pollak being a rather dumb-founded leader of a Hungarian mob from Chicago. I found it all worked together magnificently. Also I thoroughly enjoyed the music weaved into the some of the scenes in the restaurant and at Niagara Falls. You probably wont treat this film as an almost religious experience like you probably think I did, but it is defiantly a good laugh. ****",The Whole Nine Yards
217,ahbras,"Matthew Perry as Oz was so awesome. - I cant believe that he, wasn't at least nominated for many awards",10,28 June 2006,"Matthew Perry as Oz was so awesome. I cant believe that he wasn't at least nominated for every award. The nominations the film did get were very well deserved. I don't know what the competition was that year, but it must have been something out of this world for this movie to be so overlooked.This is a comedy to set the acting standard for, not only, Best ACTING IN A COMEDY category, but for drama category as well.Fabulous acting AND directing, since it is hard to get such fabulous performances without a terrific director.Matthew Perry's timing and style is ever so right for his character, I cant imagine it being played by any other actor. Each of the others, principle and supporting actors, were outstanding as well.I still cant believe that this movie didn't get nominated in more than two categories.I watch this movie even now (2006), the acting is so dead on. The story line is very funny, very entertaining, and such a nice diversion from serious reality. Perhaps the awards committees don't take incredible story line movies seriously.",The Whole Nine Yards
218,Tsnotpz,Really Great Once,9,30 August 2005,"The problem I have with this movie, which is the only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10, is that it's only funny once. The jokes are hysterical the first time, but each time you watch it again, they become predicted and give at most an internal chuckle. Matthew Perry does a fantastic job as a character absolutely out of his mind with fear trying to get out of the situation that he has landed himself in. Bruce Willis plays the part of an ex-mafia hit-man decent enough. I don't exactly believe he would be interested in tomatoes, but that doesn't make the punchline of that scenario any less funny. The writing of the story line is fluid and cohesive, making an enjoyable one-time viewing.",The Whole Nine Yards
219,chuksbili,Not interesting,5,18 May 2019,I managed to get to the end of this movie because of my love for Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. But even their characters were terrible. The storyline is not good enough to keep you captivated and the characters are all unrealistic and annoying. Amanda Peet's perky breasts made me give this forgettable movie two extra stars because it was a 3/10 for me.,The Whole Nine Yards
220,nhawkgt,In and Out Humor,8,26 February 2000,"Thought the movie was very funny at parts, especially the ones that were included in the previews.  Surprisingly, these were still funny. ; ) However, some of the jokes didn't go as well with the audience I saw it with -- the beginning, at least. The movie requires a certain atmosphere, and as the movie continues on, it places you in a laughable mood.  Good movie, and watch for the beer toss!",The Whole Nine Yards
221,sofie22,"Funny, but certainly not a masterpiece",7,18 May 2000,"I watched this movie together with a group of friends, two boys and two girls. Even though I liked the film, I was a bit disappointed, because of the very good reviews I had read before; there were some real funny moments, but I wouldn´t say , that it was one of the funniest film I`ve ever seen.I couldn´t really identify with the characters; the character of Rosanna Arquette  was very unrealistic, even for a comedy-  her accent was simply terrible, I don´t know, if it was supposed to be funny. The other two women were beautiful and (especially Perry´s love- interest) not much more. And the chemistry between Willis and Perry worked out much better than the one between women and men.Of course this isn´t really important... but I noticed, that the boys of my group liked the film much more than the girls. The girls liked it, but the boys really loved it!Maybe it´s just a coincidence, but I think, that this is a movie, boys can enjoy much more than girls. And why not...",The Whole Nine Yards
222,deadcity,It'll make you angry,1,26 February 2000,"This movie was so completely unenjoyable and so totally not funny that it will make you angry.  The script itself is uncommonly insipid and the direction is rather clueless.  How a group of people (actors, writers, producers, etc...) got together and thought that this was a funny, worthwhile project, will never cease to amaze me.",The Whole Nine Yards

224,joey-108,IT WAS HILARIOUS!!!!,10,21 February 2000,"I went and saw this movie two days ago. I must admit I'm a big fan of Matthew Perry, and that was the real reason for seeing it. But having him in it only made it better, and it still would have been excellent without him! This movie had the whole theatre laughing in their seats and is a must see for comedy lovers. It's definitely become one of my favourite movies of all time and I'm going to get it as soon as it's out on video. There are so many memorable scenes.>",The Whole Nine Yards
225,vinceman56,"Good Movie, has it's bad and good parts",8,21 February 2000,"this movie was great overall, although it did have it's weird moments. the opening scene where perry bangs his hands and head on his steering wheel just wasn't that funny to me, but other parts were hilarious. worth the money to see, especially if yer in a sad mood. it's not quite as good as some movies(such as American Pie) however it's certainly better than most!",The Whole Nine Yards
226,schneib187,Surprisingly good,10,26 February 2000,"I saw this film last night based on the previews I've seen, and because of interviews I've seen with Matthew Perry lately. I highly enjoyed this film. Very funny, and it just keeps getting better throughout. Matthew Perry is just like Chandler Bing from Friends in this movie, and that keeps things funny, and Bruce Willis and him work well together. Overall, I'm just waiting for it to come out on video, because I'm buying it as soon as it does. Excellent work!",The Whole Nine Yards
227,thabeejer,Break-Out Role for Perry,10,28 February 2000,"This was an altogether complete movie: comedy, romance, a little nudity and gangsters. Albeit a little predictable, still as entertaining a comedy as any I've seen this year. Matthew Perry is hilarious, and Bruce Willis is a believable hit-man. I haven't laughed as hard as I did when Perry... well, you'll have to see the movie.",The Whole Nine Yards
228,ykhan,"Wasn't expecting much, but got a lot",9,4 March 2000,"Went into this movie not expecting a lot from it. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a cerebral comedy by any stretch of the imagination, but good in a slapstick kind of way. Reminded me of a modern version of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, or the Three Stooges: a guy completely in over his head, completely out of his league. There were some good site gags that many people may not have noticed about this movie, like the fact that this guy is driving a Toyota Corolla, and not something fancy. Some people have noted that Rosanna Arquette as Matthew Perry's bitchy french Canadian wife had a horrible accent, and badly acted, but I think that was deliberate, it just added to the slapstick. I also found it amusing that they didn't try to hide the fact that they were in Montreal, and not try to pass it off as New York or some other American city, because it was important to some of the gags about Canadian vs. American tastes. A lot of so-called American movies are filmed in Canada these days, and they always try to pass off our cities as some American city rather than as themselves: good touch. And watch the Keystone Cops they were hilarious.",The Whole Nine Yards
229,vkuevda,Perfect operator/director work.,10,22 May 2001,"One of the best (if not the best) movies I've seen for last several years. It doesn't have any ""deep idea"" etc., but operator/director job was done absolutely perfectly. And that's what I just love in this movie.I'd say both of them (director & operator) well deserve Oscar.",The Whole Nine Yards

It doesn't matter if you like action, comedy, love stories, or if you just enjoy seeing Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis act, this movie IS for you!!!  It will keep you guessing how the whole thing will end.  I guess to sum it up it has THE WHOLE NINE YARDS!!",The Whole Nine Yards
231,8279,Sublime and funny in one movie,9,28 May 2000,This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Bruce Willis as a nice serial killer is functioning very well. Wonderfull action and acting by the whole crew. Matthew Perry is really acting like you have never seen him before. He is really in the same class as Tom Hanks in The Green Mile! Anyway this is a movie you have to see and remember to buy it when it comes on DVD! This movie works all the way,The Whole Nine Yards
232,itsnorm,Laugh so hard you'll cry,10,1 June 2000,"I can't say enough about ""The Whole Nine Yards"".  It had all of the ingredients for a great comedy, and it delivered.  The characters were well-developed, but not too 3-dimensional (this *is* a comedy, after all!). The plot was also just intricate enough... not impossible to follow, and not too basic.  Most importantly, though, the laughs keep coming.  There are several parts of the movie where I found myself laughing all the way down to my gut.This may not be an academy award winner, but it serves its purpose: it'll make you laugh.  This would be a great one to own and watch with a bunch of friends.  See it!",The Whole Nine Yards
233,Nar1n,Surprisingly Satisfying,8,3 August 2000,"I was not expecting much when I popped the DVD in, and admittedly almost gave up after the first 20 minutes or so.  I am glad I stuck with it, however, because as it turns out, I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.  Sure, Perry doesn't explore any acting areas not already mastered by Chandler, but hey, I like Chandler.  Definitely a great rent.",The Whole Nine Yards
234,natyalvarez,Good Rental Movie,8,17 August 2000,"The Whole Nine Yards is a great movie, with good actors and lots of laughs. Amanda Peet's performance is at its best, but sadly, Rosanna Arquette's performance was not good.

235,ttsxii,A new standard for Lame!,2,17 August 2000,"Everything about this movie was lame.  If there was ever a doubt of the limitations of Matthew Perry's talent, this movie confirms it.

I have a hard time watching Matthew Perry on the big screen, and taking him seriously, but he does a respectable job.  Bruce Willis is well cast and does a great job. As far as Rosanna Arquette goes, if you're gonna cast someone in a part that requires speaking with an accent please make sure that they can pull the accent off!!  Close but no cigar.",The Whole Nine Yards

In fact, the movie makes me wanna puke, the characters, the plot, the way it´s built up- it´s all very fake(and sweet). Definite candidate for the leader of the top 100 most fake movies ever. I´m a big Mathew fan but even that won´t make me watch it again. And comedy, please, only just some very lame jokes(actually to think of the movie as a comedy is a big comedy of its own).Basically it´s one of those movies you spend an hour and a half watching and later discover yourself thinking that you could have spent the time much, much more productively, that is if you don´t fall asleep in the mean time:)I think I´ve seen enough Jonathan Lynn movies for a decade.",The Whole Nine Yards

This movie is when I fell in love with Amanda Peet (no, I'm not a stalker). She did a wonderful job.  I haven't missed any movies of her since then, and I rented some of the movies she had been in before.  I saw this movie because of Bruce Willis (my favorite actor) and Matthew Perry.  Although they helped make this movie what it is, Amanda played just as an important role. Kevin Pollack even did an excellent job.  I still find myself saying ""Ansver Dat"" when the phone rings.  I've been getting excited about the premiere of The Whole Ten Yards.  I just planned a trip to LA to try and get a glimpse of the actors/actresses.

This could be Kevin Pollak's funniest role to date. Arquette plays a ""Love to hate her"" wife and may be one of the best villains in a comedy. The rest of women are sexy and beautiful. The story line is unpredictable and enjoyable. The actors are wonderful. Even the music in this movie is great. Matthew Perry is incredible at physical comedy. There are traces of his Chandler character in this one, but it makes you love him even more. You will fall in love with Natasha Henstridge. She has a classic beauty that fortunately is well displayed in this file. This movie and the people involved in making it have not received enough credit for this comedic gem.",The Whole Nine Yards
