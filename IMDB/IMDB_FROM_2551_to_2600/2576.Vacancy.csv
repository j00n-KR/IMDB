0,bkoganbing,Norman Bates Should Have Had A Set Up Like This,5,9 May 2007,"I'm convinced that players like Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson take roles in films like Vacancy because they get a chance to overact outrageously and no one notices. That and the fact that slasher films do make a lot of money no matter how good or bad they are.Two newly marrieds, our lead players, get lost on a highway and arrive at an out of the way motel with a car that's broken down. The decor is right out of pest control, but it's better than sleeping in the vehicle so they think.To their horror they discover the place is a trap used for the making of snuff films and the manager who runs it has quite a collection. He's quite the little organizer the manager and Beckinsale and Wilson spend the rest of the film avoiding what they have in store. It doesn't help that the entire place has both cameras and listening devices all over. I would have said bugs, but there are plenty of those too.Acting honors in this epic go to Frank Whaley as the manager, in his performance, he makes Beckinsale and Wilson look like a pair of lawn ornaments.It looks like everybody had a great old time making this, so if you like slasher flicks you'll enjoy this.",Vacancy
1,Leofwine_draca,Ridiculously unrealistic horror/thriller,4,26 November 2016,"VACANCY is one of those thrillers in which a fairly good premise is ruined by a sloppy execution. It begins predictably enough, with a bickering couple whose car breaks down forced to stay at a run-down motel managed by a creepy, nerdish guy. Soon enough there's a twist when they stick on a videotape and realise that snuff films have been made right in the room they're in and they're next on the list.So far, so good. The set-up and look of the film is very familiar, but I could overlook that. There were a few chilling vibes a la HOSTEL, especially during the videotape playback. Not a great deal of atmosphere, but a little suspense. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale were a couple of sympathetic leads, so I was looking forward to some cat-and-mouse hijinks. But then the film falls apart to become an endless chase, and reality goes out of the window. Our heroes crawl through a network of underground tunnels, are chased by masked, boiler suit-wearing killers modelling themselves on Michael Myers, escape death numerous times...and I just stopped caring at that point. It's ludicrous, it really is, and would have worked better as a nightmare sequence than a film supposedly set in the real world.It reminded me of FLIGHTPLAN, in that there's no way the villains would have gone to this much elaboration and trouble to commit their crime. The film never picks up after then either. The ending is highly predictable as is the intervention of a sole sheriff character. In the end, this is a bore – or indeed a chore – to watch. Not the worst I've seen, but getting pretty close in places.",Vacancy
2,SnoopyStyle,Great simple B-horror movie,7,17 July 2014,Couple Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David Fox (Luke Wilson) take a detour from the interstate. They had suffered a personal lost. They have car trouble and they end up at an isolated motel. Ethan Embry plays the mechanic. Mason (Frank Whaley) is the motel clerk. Then they discover the video tapes of the previous occupants of their motel room.It's a simple B-horror movie with an A-list cast. It's got good mood. It's old school. It's not trying to be too clever. It also provides good thrills. Anchoring it all is the compelling duo of Beckinsale and Wilson. They are a good every couple except so much more expressive and great rooting interest.,Vacancy

6,kosmasp,Delivery,7,11 July 2007,"This movie delivers on it's premise and what more could you ask for, when it comes down to horror/suspense movies? Not much, if you ask me. The storyline per se, is believable (with the occasional hole here and there, like why didn't he/she do this or that, which would've been more logical) enough.Yes you will have a few cliché moments and some tender moments, but they all work out fine. You just have to let yourself into the mood of the movie and then you won't even notice some of it's flaws (besides the plot/story there are continuity issues throughout the film, like doors that are closed, although they were open before and so forth). Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are believable enough in their roles to even carry some critical moments. There will be obviously a few deleted scenes on the DVD, things that hinted at in the movie, but never called back upon ... A last thing to say: Bare in mind, this is not a slasher movie, but a suspense horror flick! :o)",Vacancy
7,gavin6942,A Surprisingly Gritty and Dark Mainstream Film,7,22 August 2007,"A couple with relationship issues breaks down on the side of the road in a place that neither of them recognize. After a mechanic (played by Ethan Embry) fails to help them, they must spend the night in a seedy motel that doesn't clean the sheets nearly often enough (sort of like the Northland Motel in Appleton, Wisconsin). Oh, that, and there's a gang of killers who like to hang out here, too.I have never heard of director Nimród Antal before and am not familiar with his previous work. But I will say this: he puts on one dark and gritty show (which I would compare to ""Derailed"" if I wasn't already known to over-reference said film). While I don't think I was ever scared throughout the film, I was a bit uncomfortable with some of the subject matter -- particularly the home videos that brought my mind to thinking of ""Henry"", another film that's rather gritty.Luke Wilson impressed me here, not being funny at all and still giving a solid performance. He might be a real actor after all. Kate Beckinsale has lately been ""the hot chick"" with tight clothes (see ""VanHelsing"" or ""Underworld""), but she largely ignores that stereotype here. Granted, she's still an attractive woman, but this was not the film's selling point. She had to rely on her acting skills, which I found rather remarkable.I must again express my pleasure with the darkness of this film. I figured any movie with names this big (Wilson and Beckinsale) was going to cater to the teen crowd or the people who want a thriller with little blood and gore. But they really came through for me, not pulling punches. Sure, it's not ""Hostel"" or ""Saw"", but I'm glad -- because they found a way to inspire real terror. While the scenario presented here is far-fetched, it's not impossible. You could really get attacked in a stranded hotel.Comparisons could be made to other films. Sure, you have ""Psycho"" with the dangerous motel, although there's little else to compare. Better ones would be ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""House of 1000 Corpses"" because car trouble leads to staying at a murderous resting place. Maybe this film is derivative, maybe not. Personally, I thought it was pretty intense and new enough to really stand out.I am suggesting you rent this movie. It will likely not be the horror film of 2007, but I'm starting to think it might make the top three or at the least the least ten. If you watch as many horror films as I do, that's actually a rather ringing endorsement. Keep a pack of cigarettes and a whiskey on ice handy because you'll be on the edge of your seat with this one. (As an added bonus, do what I did and watch this film while staying at a hotel... that's a kicker!)",Vacancy
8,lee_eisenberg,about what you would expect,5,13 September 2015,"I didn't have high expectations for Nimród Antal's ""Vacancy"", so I wasn't disappointed. Basically, the message that all moviegoers should gleam from movies set in motels is to be suspicious (look what happened to Marion Crane). Hell, if ""1408"" - based on a Stephen King book - is any indication, then not even regular hotels are safe.Basically, the movie delivers what it promises. If you expect a typical horror flick then you'll get your prize. I guess that from now on, I'll call this movie the horror flick starring the woman from ""Cold Comfort Farm"" (about an English socialite who meets her eccentric rural relatives) and the man from ""Idiocracy"" (about a future United States populated entirely by stupid people).",Vacancy
9,jboothmillard,Vacancy,7,29 November 2007,"The critics give this film four stars, I can't personally see it being that good, but it certainly isn't terrible. Basically married couple, David (usually doing comedy, Luke Wilson, Owen's brother) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale) on the verge of divorce after the loss of a child are travelling off the interstate, and when the car experiences car trouble they first stop at a small station where a guy tries to fix it, but only two miles driving it goes bust. So they decide to walk back to the station, where they find a motel behind it (borrowing the premise of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho), and the manager Mason (Frank Whaley) suggests they stay the night till the mechanic gets back. They get in their room, and it is really seedy and unpleasant, and after a few minutes someone is banging on the door and other side of the wall and won't stop or answer. When this eventually stops they try to relax, David turns on the TV, and when he sees the reception isn't very good, he decides to put in a video, and as he watches these ""horror movies"" he notices the room the victims are in, their room! When they realise they are obviously going to be next for their own snuff movie of death, they know they must get away. But soon enough, as they expected, masked men are waiting outside and trying to get in to kill them. David and Amy are now trying everything they can to keep them out, get out and get help, hide and avoid their fate, and protect themselves. Also starring Ethan Embry as Mechanic, Scott G. Anderson as Killer, Mark Cassella as Truck Driver and David Doty as Highway Patrol. Wilson and Beckinsale are quite suited to their roles, Whaley is no Norman Bates, but he is definitely another Sy Parrish (Robin Williams in One Hour Photo) multiplied, and actually intent on murder, a good film with hardly any gore, but enough thrills to please. Very good!",Vacancy
10,Woodyanders,"A pleasingly tight, trim and genuinely terrifying horror thriller winner",8,22 April 2007,"Bickering, unhappy, soon to be divorced married couple David (superbly played by Luke Wilson) and Amy (the equally excellent Kate Beckinsale) are driving cross country in a remote rural backroads area. The testy twosome are forced to rent a room for the night at a seedy fleabag hotel when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. To make matters worse, the hotel's nerdy bespectacled manager Mason (a marvelously creepy portrayal by Frank Whaley) has some very nasty plans in store for David and Amy: Mason and a few fellow sicko buddies are going to brutally kill them and videotape their murders. Director Nimrod Antal expertly wrings plenty of nerve-wracking tension from the gripping premise, maintains a steady snappy pace throughout, and elicits fine performances from a bang-up cast. Mark L. Smith's clever and concise script relates an absorbing and unnerving story that's genuinely scary and disturbing because it comes across as frightfully plausible and possible. Wilson and Beckinsale are utterly believable and sympathetic as the hapless imperiled leads while Whaley makes a strong impression as the geeky head villain. Both Paul Haslinger's splendidly spooky'n'stirring score and Andrzej Sekula's shadowy, claustrophobic cinematography are likewise solid and effective. But what really makes this film such a winner is it's commendable dearth of pretense: it's only 80 minutes long, the suspense never lets up once the basic plot is established, and there's no padding or filler to speak of. The movie's gritty and unrelenting mean'n'lean straightforward style conveys a sense of complete dread and hopelessness that's extremely potent and harrowing. Taut, trim and terrifying, this overall sturdy and satisfying fright feature thriller sleeper rates highly as a welcome and refreshing departure from the depressing glut of remakes, sequels and video game adaptations which have been cluttering up the horror genre as of late.",Vacancy
11,rmax304823,Low-level thrills.,2,18 February 2008,"A bickering couple (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) are forced to register at an isolated motel when their car breaks down. They shortly discover a pile of VHS tapes in their room. They play the tapes and find that they are snuff films (for want of a better word) that were shot by secreted cameras in the very room they now occupy. The motel manager with the creepy, over-sized eyes is running some kind of private show. His two or three goons wear generic horror-movie masks. The goons begin trying to force their way into the motel room.The husband tries to hold the unlocked door half shut while the maniac on the other side has thrust his arm through, waving a butcher knife around wildly. The wife shrieks and hides. The husband is knifed in the gut defending her and collapses with a shudder into a pool of blood. Now on her own, the wife emerges from her hiding place, outwits and kills the two goons, and finally plugs the motel manager.It's done by the numbers and it sucks. The first fifteen minutes are a set up for what might have been an interesting thriller, but the prologue is quickly passed and what we have on our hands is two innocent folks being pursued by murderous baboons.Oh, a lone, state cop stops to poke around a bit. He's old and wheezing, and the minute we see him we know he's toast. There are murders by strangling, stabbing, shooting, being crushed against a wall by a speeding car, and by generic trauma. That's not counting the two screaming naked girls we see being manhandled and finally terminated on the videotapes. A dead body comes back to life, but it's not the maniac, it's the supposedly dead husband. It uses every cheap shock trick in The Handbook of Cheap Shots. You can't count the number of times those masked faces pop up in unexpected places, out of the shadows. If you reach your Biblically allotted life span of 70 years, your heart will have beaten 2,358,720,000 (that's billion, with a B). That's how many times a hand or a body darts in from out of the frame to attack one of the victims. If you like seeing innocent people terrified, chased and slaughtered -- especially naked young women -- this is your film. What a piece of meretricious crap.If you want to see a very good movie about a spooky motel run by a maniac, watch Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""",Vacancy
12,ma-cortes,"Tension, suspense, and unsettling scenes when a couple is stranded at a solitary Motel",6,25 December 2009,"This exciting movie deals about David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox( Kate Beckinsale), a young marriage with problems . The couple is traveling when their car breaks down but then they are helped by a mechanic (Etham Embry). Later on, the car again fails and David along with his wife Amy come across a Hotel located in the middle of nowhere and attended by a rare receptionist (Frank Whalley). At the room they are surveyed by hidden cameras and trapped by locked doors and thundering noises. After that, they're besieged by psycho-killer attackers and then look for some means to getaway through underground tunnels.This spooky picture contains action,terror,shocks, suspense, grisly killings and numerous creepy scenes. The film packs terrifying and hair-raising frames and a little bit of blood and gore . The grade Z slasher films which the Hotel broadcasts for its guests's entertainment are filmed in similar naturalist and realist style to ¨ Henry, portrait of a killer¨ directed by James McNaughton . While the look is suitable eerie and frightening, the argument spreads to the breaking point and the ending turns out to be a little frustrating and commercial. Suspenseful and thrilling musical score by Paul Haslinger. Dark and shaded cinematography by Andrzej Sekula who is expert on strange atmosphere as he proved in ¨Cube 2¨ and ¨ American psycho¨. The motion picture is professionally directed by Nemród Antal. He was born in Los Angels though is of Hungarian origin. In 2oo5 he moved back to his ancestry place , Hungary, where he directed ¨Control¨ gaining several prizes and quite a big impact . He returned United States where filmed ¨Vacancy¨ which achieved undoubted success and huge reputation.

13,BA_Harrison,That'll teach me to take my time.,6,6 July 2007,"It's always the way, isn't it? You have a great idea for a filmthe owner of a motel kills his guests, filming the deaths in order to make snuff moviesthat you sit on for waaaay too long (a decade, in this instance), and eventually someone comes along and makes something almost identical.Anyhoo, lesson learnt, I will now try and review Vacancy without letting sour grapes get in the way.Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson play a married couple whose relationship is almost at an end after the death of their son (an unnecessary sub-plot). After their car develops engine problems, whilst on a long journey, they are forced to book into a remote motel run by a creepy manager (Frank Whaley).But once inside their room, they find that they are being watched (via several hidden video cameras), and are lined-up to become the latest stars in an apparently long line of snuff films featuring the unfortunate guests of this particular establishment.Saddled with a script that has several silly plot-holes and some questionable moments (more about that later), director Nimród Antal surprisingly manages to deliver a tense thriller/horror which, whilst no classic, is a reasonable way to spend an hour and a half. His main characters act intelligently enough given their situations, and the film provides some decent scares and atmosphere without having to resort to OTT gore scenes and genre clichés.Both Wilson and Beckinsale make reasonable would-be victims, but it is Whaley's twitchy, mustachioed weirdo who is definitely the standout character of the movie: hamming it up to the max, he is clearly enjoying playing this mean spirited sicko.'But what about those plot-holes and questionable moments?', I hear you ask.Well.....The killers secretly enter and leave the motel rooms via trap-doors in the bathroom floor, which are hidden by bath mats. How do the killers leave the room and manage to re-cover the trap-door so that it is not visible?The manager keeps two fully loaded revolvers mounted on the wall above his counter. Is this common practice?Surely someone dealing in snuff movies would have upgraded to supplying DVDs rather than video cassettes. I wouldn't shell out much for a VHS tape.How does Wilson's character avoid bleeding to death after being stabbed? He's laying there all blinkin' night!Of course, there were other moments that caused me to raise an eyebrow, but these were the ones that particularly got my goat.As a popcorn horror movie, Vacancy is OKit just doesn't make the most of its interesting set-up.Suffice to say, my version would have been much better.",Vacancy

15,Coventry,"Norman Bates, where are you?",2,8 December 2007,"Apparently times haven't changed that much since Norman Bates ran his motel in Alfred Hitchcock's legendary horror classic ""Psycho"", released in 1960. The old, secluded motels in rural America are still owned and run by homicidal maniacs, only now they're slaughtering their guests for commercial & profitable reasons (the shooting and distribution of snuff-films) rather than reasons of insanity. That pretty much summarizes the concept of ""Vacancy"", and the execution of the movie isn't very remarkable, neither. In fact, ""Vacancy"" is probably one of the least original mainstream horror-thrillers that got released during the last couple of years and I personally find it incomprehensible that still so many people like it and tend to give it positive reviews. The first half hour of the film is literally just a seemingly endless listing of all the dreadful and implausible clichés that give the horror genre such a bad name and the reputation of being inferior. A young and constantly arguing couple are driving on forsaken backwoods roads in the middle of nowhere at night. They left the safe highway in order to try an unknown shortcut, they nearly crash when trying to avoid hitting a raccoon, they face engine trouble and of course their cell phones don't work. Just when you think the scriptwriter used up all the annoying clichés already, we learn that the couple recently lost their only child in a horrible accident. Oh, please! That's also the reason why David and Amy are arguing and discussing the upcoming divorce all the time, by the way. The middle section of the film is admittedly a bit more enjoyable, as there are some neat (but far too brief) moments of suspense and an adequate use of the isolated filming locations. The events are still extremely derivative, with the couple trapped inside their cabin and besieged by masked snuff-killers, but at least there's some adrenalin-rushing action. The grand finale is a total disaster again, with a truckload of holes in the plot, the protagonists making really stupid decision to try and save themselves and a mainstream conclusion that is perhaps the most frustratingly weak and pathetic one I've ever seen. Gee, do you think this petrifying misadventure brought the arguing couple closer together again?!? Right, I give them another six months before they kill each other! Acting and directing are all very mundane. Slapstick-comedy star Luke Wilson (""Old School"", ""Legally Blonde"") is terribly miscast here and Kate Beckinsale, no matter how beautiful she may be, is thoroughly implausible as the dame in distress. I didn't expect any gore or vile bloodshed going into ""Vacancy"", just a bit of genuine tension, brutal & grim atmosphere and likable characters. But clearly that was already too much to ask for.

David unwisely leaves the interstate looking for a short cut and swerves to avoid hitting a raccoon, this causes engine trouble and eventually they have to settle for staying at a grotty roadside motel until the car can be fixed in the morning. Upon attempting to relax in their dirty and poorly decorated room, they are disturbed by loud banging on the doors to their room, this is merely the start of a night of terror as the Fox's will be forced to fight to stay alive in the confines of this Horror Motel!Seen it before? Yes we all most certainly have, from proto slashers to Euro terrors, the couple under siege formula is as old as the hills themselves. But Vacancy has such a sense of fun and a unique use of its plot setting, that even a terribly formulaic cop out towards the end is mostly forgiven. The setting is one dirty hole of a motel, but the dirt is not merely confined to the structure and basic house keeping of the place, the worst dirt comes in a terrifying form that is fully formed from the moment we meet the creepy motel manager (a wonderfully cheesy Frank Whaley). From here our intrepid couple, very well played by Luke Wilson & Kate Beckinsale, must use the most basic resources to hand, to hopefully escape the clutches of masked assailants intent on gutting them in the name of entertainment.What follows is the usual jumps and perilous set ups, and a quirky line in labyrinth adventure. But then that ending that almost derails the whole picture, it does hurt it because we the viewers can only feel let down that the makers chose to not stay with what would have been an impacting turn of events. But for a film that's homaging films (and thriller maestros) from the past and clearly doing what it set out to do, it's to me a forgivable error. It's not taking itself too seriously, and you shouldn't too, just check in with the Fox's and get involved with the thrills. 6.5/10",Vacancy

It is well-directed and the acting is very good (especially Whaley who chews the scenery) but it just falls to pieces halfway through.

20,poolandrews,Average & tame Hostel rip-off.,5,1 February 2010,"Vacancy starts late one night as estranged couple David (Luke Wilson) & Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale) try to reach the town of Downey, because of a crash & back up David decides to take the scenic route through the middle of nowhere & becomes hopelessly lost. They find a gas station & a helpful mechanic (Ethan Embry) gives them directions & checks their car, once back on the road the Fox's car breaks down. Stranded miles from anywhere David & Amy head back to the gas station & the nearby Pinewood Motel where they decide to stay the night, the manager (Frank Whaley) gives them the honeymoon suit but while watching some VHS tapes lying around it becomes clear that the Motel & that room in particular is being used to make vile snuff films where guy's in mask's brutally attack & murder anyone unfortunate enough to stay there & it is intended that David & Amy are to star in their next snuff film...Directed by Nimród Antal I suspect that Vacancy was made to cash-in on the success & apparent popularity of mainstream so-called 'torture porn' (I hate that description) flicks like Saw (2004) & Hostel (2005) although it maybe owes as much debt to Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho (1960) with it's isolated motel setting & deranged manager but updates the idea by introducing the concept of snuff films. The first twenty odd minutes is horror film cliché hell as two people driving along in the middle of nowhere at night get lost (stop me if you've heard this before) & if that wasn't clichéd enough neither of them can get a signal on their mobile phone (seriously, stop me now please...) & eventually come across an old gas station (right, I'll stop myself then). Once the typical teen horror set-up is out of the way & we shift to the motel not that much happens besides three or four guy's chasing David & Amy around while making lots of noise (why didn't they get into David & Amy's room by smashing the windows?) before inevitably the tables are turned & in a fight for survival the good guy's win. There's lots of running around & a cop show's up at one point (after hours of him not reporting back wouldn't more cops have been sent to see if he was OK?) & I don't really understand the logic behind the leaving of the snuff tapes in the room for any potential victims to watch & be forewarned. Also while I'm at it why did they leave that car (complete with screwdriver in ignition to start it) so close to the motel? At just over 80 odd minutes at least it's short & the lack of any reasoning behind the snuff makers makes things a bit more suspenseful but overall while Vacancy isn't too bad I can't really say it's any better than average.One major, major disappointment about Vacancy is that it is so tame, despite dealing with snuff films & trying to leech of the reputation of the likes of Saw & Hostel this is almost bloodless & doesn't feature any 'Torture Porn' as far as I could see. There is one shot of a few splashes of blood dripping onto a shoe & some bloody gunshot wounds right at the end when someone is shot but otherwise this is very tame. Even the so-called snuff film footage doesn't actually feature anything graphic or being killed. With absolutely zero torture or gore the makers obviously went down the suspense, tension & scare route, there are a few decent scenes but none have any real pay-off & it does tend to get a little repetitive after a while.With a supposed budget of about $19,000,000 this had over three times the budget of both Saw & Hostel put together yet comes across as inferior & tamer. The opening credits scene feels like a very stylised comic book & isn't too dissimilar to the credits sequence for Psycho. The acting is pretty good from a decent cast but did anyone else think Frank Whaley in this looked like a psychotic redneck Ned Flanders from The Simpsons?Vacancy is an OK horror thriller with more of an emphasis on the thriller aspects than the horror side of things, also if your looking for any amount of blood or gore then give Vacancy a miss as it's almost bloodless. Followed by the straight to video Vacancy 2: The First Cut (2009) which by all accounts is a prequel.",Vacancy

Still, the two leads  Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale  cope pretty well under the circumstances (mixing understandable fear with an incredible resolve for survival, leading to a surprising resourcefulness in overcoming the gang of stalkers); needless to say, they bond together throughout this whole ordeal, which forces them to consider the position they had previously taken vis-a'-vis their crumbling marriage.On the other hand, Frank Whaley as the unhinged owner of the run-down hotel (and, as it so obviously transpires soon enough, chief villain) hams it up incessantly  rendering his character ludicrous as opposed to menacing!

Clearly this individual has never seen a Hitchcock movie. This is one of those thrillers where the plot can only move forward by the characters consistently doing the wrong thing. Actually, it requires them to be completely incapable of making a good decision or having the slightest bit of survival instinct or awareness of their surroundings. Because of this (and other annoying character traits), you don't really root for the protagonists. Nor do you care what happens to them.Anyway, despite a good cast and a couple of decent jump scares, the movie is ultimately forgettable.

David and Amy Fox (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) committed all three errors.The bickering passive aggressive couple were on their way home from a family gathering when David decided to take a detour due to a crash on the main highway. Eventually he reached a point where he was lost and on top of that he damaged the car when he swerved to miss a raccoon. They stopped at the first gas station they saw for directions and perhaps a mechanic's opinion. Instead they got a mechanic who tampered with the vehicle and debilitated it. With it being too late to do anything else the couple stayed at the nearby roach motel. And that's when the craziness started.Much like we'd see in ""The Strangers"" in 2008, ""Vacancy"" was about a sadistic group of men who loved to terrorize the guests of the out-of-the-way motel. These psychotic freaks videoed their activities. And judging by their film library, they were prolific killers.

You're getting a thriller where a couple are doing their best to avoid becoming the latest involuntary stars of the snuff movies being turned out by several murderous individuals. The premise is straightforward, if somewhat derivative.I confess to being pleased right from the opening credit sequence. This was strongly reminiscent of the opening of Psycho, albeit neither Bass's credits nor Hermann's core was copied: they were clearly the inspiration, though.I very much liked the character arc the two leading characters went through: that the very horror they were facing served to make them recognise what they were losing by allowing their marriage to disintegrate.Despite the economical running time, I thought the opening sequence, up to the point where they went into the motel reception, was more leisurely than it needed to be. But as soon as they were in the motel room and the banging started, the suspense level went right up, and never let up until the end.I was very impressed when a certain event happened to a certain character about an hour in - not since Janet Leigh's death in Psycho can I recall something so unexpected happening to a major character. A little while later, that was negated and my wife and I both went, ""Oh, come on!"" although our scoffing at that point was diluted at the end by the remaining uncertainty. It is rare for a film of this nature to leave matters as unresolved as they were here, where a number of things could have happened after the film ended.To sum up, an undemanding suspense thriller, high on suspense and perhaps low on originality, with enough thrills to satisfy its target audience, and a number of aspects to recommend it.",Vacancy

Their only luxury is video tapes of murders that they soon learn happened in the very room they are in. Director Nimrod Antal does a fantastic job with the location making every use of its secrets and passages. Third act becomes the standard hack and slash. Wilson and Beckinsale do very well as they struggle to survive the nightmare. What is even better is that the conclusion presents one of them as wounded while the other must face uncertain danger. Frank Whaley steals scenes as a sadistic motel manager who films the images on the very videos that the couple viewed. His departure comes at the reality of not paying attention to where you pommel your victim. Ethan Embry is wasted as a gas station clerk whose presence is obvious. Scott G. Anderson is billed as a character named Killer. One would suspect this poses a problem when presenting an I.D.

This is mostly due to the fact that it's just so long until it gets good that there's barely anything of interest before then. The beginning of this is completely dull and boring, filled with the couple arguing or just not doing anything of any real importance, the least of which is the fact that it takes so long before anything happens as we're stuck in the motel for so long with them and the owner that it's just hard to stay interested. It also needs fixing when it gets to them being trapped in the room waiting around as it takes forever for the group to come in and attack after releasing that they know, which just drags the film out far longer than it should as the rest of the attacks are so brief it hardly matters how intense they are. Some better editing in the underground tunnels would've made it easier to understand what happened there, since it's almost impossible to figure out the action there due to the darkness and the claustrophobic feelings. There is some really good stuff here, mainly in the first few confrontations with the killers in their room and out in the complex and the different locations around the area in the later half, as well as the rather creepy revelation scene in the motel room where the horror gradually dawns on them what's going on.

The fact that the film (as shown in the very good featurette additions) was filmed entirely on a studio set adds to the admiration that grows after the fright diminishes. And writer Mark L. Smith and director Nimród Antal deserve credit for their project.The plot is simple: on a night road married couple Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David Fox (Luke Wilson) are lost and the tension of the night only ads to the fact that this couple is in the throes of a broken marriage, one that fractured at the accidental death of their only son. Frustrated and angry with each other and their plight, they end up stranded in the middle of nowhere and check in to a morbid motel managed by the oily and repulsive Mason (Frank Whaley). From the moment they enter their room they realize something is wrong: the videos on the television are snuff films filmed in the room in which they are staying. From there the action of the film speeds up and is a non-stop ingenious attempt to escape the killers that besiege their room. The trauma of the night makes Amy and David reconsider their history and the film ends with a grande guignol bang.Beckinsale and Wilson make a credible couple and the writer and director have opted to make the film more about the relationship of the estranged couple than just about horror.

33,The_Void,Surprisingly excellent modern horror thriller!,8,20 June 2007,"Well, I have to say that it's nice to a see a thoroughly grim horror movie that puts all of its focus on the things that make horror movies great, and does an extremely good job of it! The film takes obvious influence from the classic film Psycho, as well as the recent surge of snuff related horror films - films like Hostel and Saw. The plot is very simple and this is definitely a good thing as it allows director Nimród Antal to increase the amount of shocks and scares, and the result is a taut and terrifying little thriller that is sure to delight most people who see it. The plot simply focuses on soon be divorced couple David and Amy Fox (played by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale). They're on their way home after a party at her mother's house, and the couple are still hurt after the tragic loss of their child. They soon end up lost on the dark and winding roads, and after pulling in at a petrol station, they discover that they're not where they thought were. They are pointed in the right direction, but unfortunately their engine dies and they decide to walk back to the petrol station and stay in the nearby motel, and that is where the trouble starts as all is not what is seems.There are a number of plot holes in this film and many of the decisions that the couple makes aren't what most people would do - but it's not important as the situation is always portrayed as being very real, and the director does an excellent job of putting the audience in the same situation as the central characters. The film is just the right length and none of the running time is taken up by filler as the director prefers to spend his time shocking and keeping the audience on the edge of their seats rather than boring them with unnecessary details - which is definitely commendable. The central performances are all excellent and really help to give the film a quality feel as well as making sure the audience cares for the characters. Both the leading actors give realistic impressions of their characters; and this is all the better for the fact that these roles are not what we usually see from Luke Wilson (more of a comedic actor) and Kate Beckinsale (who made a load of romantic comedies before kicking arse in Underworld). The final piece comes from Frank Whaley, who is deliciously insane in his pivotal role. Overall, this film comes highly recommended.

You know whenever a lumbering old police officer shows up, he won't survive more than a couple of minutes.

It isn't because you were glasses that you are a creep. Anyway, a movie with Kate in it I guessed that it would be a bit underrated in the case of the gore and blood, but Kate surely is believable as in Underworld. Of course it wouldn't be Hollywood to give it an open and happy end all for you to guess what happens after the end credits and talking about them, the credits in the beginning of this movie has something over them like those good old exploitation ones.

And to remember never to bicker incessantly with my wife because she's always right, and everyone else deserves to have their heads bash in because otherwise, they'll snuff us.Clocking in at a mere 80 minutes thereabout, Vacancy seemed like a decent thrill-a-minute ride, with Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale playing an estranged Fox couple, spending the first 20 of those precious minutes arguing for the most parts inside their BMW. They take their time to set themselves up for the fall, and in the process fail to heed the warning signs which you can learn all about in the movie Scream. The person who's helping you has ulterior motives usually designed to get you in harm's way, and everything that is too conveniently true, well, surely is.You can't help but to feel that director Nimrod Antal (who directed the excellent Kontroll) was somewhat hampered by the formulaic script written by Mark L Smith. Instead of having the perpetrators stay one step ahead and in turn keeping our victims on their toes, what you experience is yourself predicting how the movie will turn out, every single step of the way, right down to pointing out where shadows will appear, and which scene will have that throwaway jump shot to elicit some cheap screams. Not surprisingly, nobody in the theatre I was watching this in felt any adrenaline rush, as they reeked of a sense of familiarity - you know who the villains are, you know what will happen to cops, and worse, Vacancy followed recent peer flicks like Wolf's Creek and the likes to exhibit some girl power.Perhaps the only scenes which will get your heart pumping, are the snuff films on display, albeit at times strategically cut away. Watching those aged films did bring on some pity at the least, that there are sickos out there who make these films for sheer pleasure and profit. And having realize that they are in dire straits, the Foxes begin figuring out in double quick time just how to survive the horrendous (in both sense of the word) night.But it's not all hopeless though, if you haven't experienced much of the movies from the same genre, then you might find Vacancy entertaining. There was something I enjoyed watching though (no, it's not Beckinsale, who still looked stunning despite having to exhibit fear throughout), and that's the beautiful main and end titles. They're wonderfully designed, and they just work. Those who have a font fetish, will most likely go ga-ga over them.Vacancy showed promise, but as you soon realize, it's nothing much other than a rehash of familiar plots and situations.

About halfway through we cannot imagine how an escape can be possible and the film slows into a rather predictable rut before leaping back into action for a rousing finish. Whilst watching this most effective thriller I imagined it was made by some American independent and was particularly impressed at the unusual tightness and the lack of any padding to stretch out beyond 90 minutes. I should have known but only later realised just who the director was. I see there are 'extended snuff films' on the extras menu for the DVD so that'll be nice!

Ethan Embry (Dutch) and Frank Whaley (Career Opportunities) both make appearances in this film much to my enjoyment. One of the reasons I've remembered Vacancy is because from 2007 - 2011 they had a phone number (1-888-9VACANCY). You could call the number and it would be like calling the actual Pinewood Motel in the film. You'd hear creepy screams in the background with Frank Whaley talking to you with his strange, unsettling tone.I used to call the number all the time and scare the crap out of myself. You'd call it and it would say ""Hey folks you've reached the Pinewood Motel, you're in luck, cause we got a room just for you. Please press one to here more about our offers, press two to make a reservation, press zero...for an operator."" It was genuinely creepy. It gave me goose bumps just typing that. Frank Whaley has one of the creepiest most memorable voices next Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine (Rusty Nail in Joy Ride).The plot: A near-divorced couple David and Amy Fox (Wilson and Beckinsale) have car troubles on their way home late at night on a backroad. They find a motel called ""The Pinewood Motel"" that is vacant and decide to stay the night and get help in the morning. They meet the motel manager named Mason (Whaley) a lanky guy, still rocking the eighties hair from his film Career Opportunities. Mason is a creepy, unsettling manager because of his calm tone and strange appearance.David and Amy find old VHS tapes on the top of their VCR in their room. When they put them on they find two goons beating the hell out of the people that stay in the same room they are in. The tapes are obviously dubbed ""snuff films."" Much to their surprise, they find cameras in the vents of the room and try to leave but the goons are outside trying to find a way in the room. It's do or die as David and Amy struggle to escape the motel.This seems like the kind of film that would've been put out during the eighties, slasher craze time. Having it set in 2007 is fine, but it's a little peculiar since the film is built off of every cliché in horror films. Take the wrong turn, stay in a motel, etc. We've seen this.The film is worth a rent/buy on DVD for two reasons; Frank Whaley's meltdown in the film and the extended snuff film footage found in the ""special features"" part of the DVD. Am I a sadist because I enjoyed the fake snuff footage? I found it to be entertaining. I would never do it, but it's kind of funny that these guys just beat on random people in a motel. We never really get a reason why they do this, but we assume it's for pleasure for the goons and for Mason.Vacancy is a high class B movie. It's odd when a horror film has A list stars like Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, who have been in so many good films. Usually these types of movies pave the way for actors in the future like Jennifer Aniston in Leprechaun, Johnny Depp in A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Kevin Bacon in Friday the 13th. Vacancy's delight comes from the footage of the snuff films and the motel's manager. That still isn't enough to call this film average.Starring: Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale, Frank Whaley, Ethan Embry. Directed by: Nimrod Antel.",Vacancy

What could it be an intruder? or unwelcome guest? More revealing is when they turn on the TV they notice all it plays are slasher films of actual people being killed. Only they look at the background and notice that the places these films were made look just like the room they are in! It's a motel horror think of it as being trapped in hell as they spot a hidden camera filming them they feel trapped the only escape is a crawlspace and underground tunnel which they discover is a gateway to hell.Overall ""Vacancy"" really teases the viewer as it tries to apply fear more thru the thought of being trapped and killed in a snuff film. It provides some drama as Amy and David battle to get away still it's fears are more psychological and the film has plenty of sounds and suspense to keep the viewer on edge as it's paced well and gets right into the theme quick. Really you feel your watching a more sadistic and voyeuristic peep style take of ""Psycho"" or ""The Shining"".",Vacancy

Sure the film has it's moments, but for the most part it seemed to drag even for the most part it's fast paced and it wasn't really scary either. This is also Kate Beckinsale in her first horror flick or at least I think she is, and she is basically the main star of this movie. The girl that starts off as a weak and scared girl turns into a girl that starts standing up for herself kinda deal. This ain't much of a slasher film either, which I don't mind for these types of movies and it revolves around mostly two people that is trying to survive. On a positive note, as the story progresses just about everything that is going on which the victims are confused of, starts to make sense and it did a good job of putting the pieces together. The characters weren't that developed though and for the most part I didn't care if the couple survived or not, which gets rid of most of the tensity and the dialogue ain't sharp either. The villains were not interesting and there is little to no mystery surrounding the whole situation although it doesn't show what is going on all at once. All in all it is a pretty mediocre movie, the direction didn't seem clear for this sometimes. Also nothing about this was original either and has a lot of cliché horror stuff.5.6/10",Vacancy
44,OllieSuave-007,"Typical thriller, stupid villains.",6,30 August 2007,"This is a typical thriller if you want to have a little scare at night. It is pretty fast-paced and gets to the action almost right away, from a divorcing couple's (Wilson and Beckinsale) issues on the road to ending at a freaky motel with strange banging noises in the room and finally to the mysterious video tapes in the room.The movie became predictable midway towards the end, where the chase between the bad guys and the good guys begin. The villains take credit for being probably the most clueless I've seen on the screen. Their dialog is very cheesy and campy (I mean, who throws their opponent on top of a gun on the floor?). There's plenty of action, but I think the climax was a little rushed through and too predictable. Otherwise, it's an OK movie for a scare.So, never check into a motel at night in the middle of nowhere. Sleep in your car instead.Grade C",Vacancy
45,sddavis63,A Great Slasher Film With Surprisingly Little Slashing,8,26 February 2008,"I can't say that I was blown away by the premise at first. A couple's car break down on a side road as they're on their way home and with no way to get it fixed until morning they take up residence for the night in a run down hotel with a creepy manager. It sounds pretty formulaic and unoriginal. In fact, it turns out to be a short, fast and pretty suspenseful movie that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for a good portion of it.The stars are Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson as Amy and David Fox. Their marriage is in trouble, and they end up stuck in this motel. For a good portion of the movie, this actually is a pretty good psychological thriller, as we watch the Foxes move from anger at each other to suspicion about the hotel to downright terror as they realize what's happening to them. Beckinsale and Wilson were completely convincing in their roles, and Frank Whaley was perfectly cast as Mason, the creepy hotel manager. He looked the part and acted it. Essentially, he seems to be running some sort of ring peddling snuff movies, and all the victims are people who stay unexpectedly in his hotel. He doesn't take credit cards, so no one can trace where these folks have been and the killers, once they're introduced, are downright terrifying. The best part of it is that this isn't just a giant bloodbath from start to finish. Actually, until the last 20 minutes or so, there really isn't much blood; it all focuses around the Fox's terror at the predicament they've found themselves in. One criticism (or at least plot oversight) that I noticed was how Mason and his gang planned to deal with the murder of the police officer. The police know they dispatched an officer to the hotel. Do they think no one will notice that he's suddenly missing after responding to a 911 call at the hotel in which the person making the call (Amy) said that someone was trying to kill her? Surely that would lead to questions and snooping by the local sheriff.That aside, this is a truly fabulous ride, and a complete surprise to me. Highly recommended. 8/10",Vacancy

Moreover, there's a sadistic undercurrent running through the movie that spoils most of the fun we could be having with the story if it had any real soul or imagination.And then there are all the nagging practical considerations, such as wondering how these sadistic yahoos pay for all that video equipment if they wind up killing the very few customers who manage to come their way.

47,sol1218,Stay at your own risk,7,12 November 2008,"**Spoilers** The film ""Vacancy"" starts out as if it was already some fifteen minutes into the Alfred Hitchcock 1960 thriller ""Psycho"" minus the sub-plot about a $40,000.00 heist and love affair between two of its major characters. Even the credits and opening Bernard Herrmann-like musical score are almost identical to the Hitchcock classic.This couple Amy & David Fox, Kaye Beckinsale & Luke Wilson, are lost after David took a short-cut off the main highway in their trip to visit Amy's parents. We see already that Amy & David aren't a happy couple with them consistently talking about getting professional help in their failing marriage. Lost and looking for directions as well as getting their damaged car fixed, after David almost crashed it in him avoiding hitting a raccoon, in order to get back on the main highway David & Amy stop off at this deserted gas station. It's there that they run into the stations mechanic,Ethan Embry, who seems to fix their car's damaged fan belt. Ethan not asking to be paid for his services did such a good job fixing the Fox's car that it conked out after driving just about two miles outside his gas station.Having no place to stay the two weary travelers walk back to the gas station for help only to find it empty, Ethan had left for the night, and reluctantly decide to spend the evening at the nearby Pinewood Motel. That would turn out to be the biggest mistake that they'll ever make in their lives!It soon turns out that the person who runs the Pinewood Motel is a harmlessly nerdy looking but extremely dangerous, once's you get to know him, psychotic named Mason, Frank Whaley. It also turns out that Mason is obsessed with making secret home movies, on video tape, of those foolish enough to stay at his motel. What's even more outrageous and deadly is that Mason specializes in making snuff films with those who get snuffed in his made for himself, and his sick and deranged clientèle, video's are the people who ended up, like Amy & David, spending the night at Mason's house of horrors!Staying in his roach infested and rusty and dirty, both hot & cold, running water room at the Pinewood Motel David with having nothing else to do, and having the door to his and Amy's room constantly pounded, pops in a video tape, one of dozens lying around the place, in the VCR connected to the motel TV. It's then that David, together with Amy, sees a home movie of a couple being brutally beaten and murdered by this gang of masked thugs. Thinking at first that he's watching a movie David soon realizes that he's watching a couple actually being murdered with their murder being video taped and later to be sold, for as much as $5,000.00, to sick degenerates who go for that kind of stuff, or snuff. What's even far more shocking then the actual murder on tape that David & Amy are watching is that the murders committed are in fact being committed in the very room that their staying at!Even though ""Vacancy"" is an obvious ""Psycho"" clone it more then hold its own against the Hitchcock slasher flick with Mason almost as creepy and at the same time, for a few brief moments, as harmless as Norman Bates; the owner of the infamous Bates Motel.What gives the film an extra kick is that Mason is not alone, like Norman was, in his murder spree but has a lot of help in doing it. Besides the friendly-looking but murderous car mechanic, Ethan Embry, Mason also has a number of masked killers who preform in his many, which seem like thousands, of snuff movies with them doing the snuffing.***MAJOR SPOILERS*** The film has a very ingenious ending with Amy left to take on both Mason and his band of killers single-handedly after David was almost, but not exactly, beaten to death by them. In the end Mason who was so vain about his looks didn't have to worry about them any more getting the kind of makeover that even Norman Bates' mummified mother couldn't match!",Vacancy

49,Robert_duder,A brilliant and captivating thriller. Takes the genre and blows it in your face,10,3 May 2007,"Vacancy is everything you could possibly ask for in the Horror/Thriller Genre. Granted many will tell you this genre is tired and old and everything they churn out now will be sub-par and predictable but it's all in how the story is created and Vacancy couldn't possibly be any more brilliant with it's direction, setting, gore, cheap scares (the kind that just make you jump), surprises, and down right brilliant performances from it's two lead stars...possibly the best roles I have ever seen them in. This film is just everything that going to see a Horror in the theater is all about and it's the best of every possible scenario. You have the isolation of the dark highway and the dimly lit, poorly kept hotel. You have the serial killer(s) in creepy dark masks, you have mysterious phone calls, you have the terrifying banging on the walls scene...this is just an absolute must see!! I have very, very little details that I would nit pick. You might find some mild plot holes, barely noticeable, and the nods to previous horror genres are seemingly plentiful (although they always are if you purposely go in looking for them.) A film about cops is always going to have a gun in it...doesn't mean they are copying Robocop or Die Hard, it means cops carry guns.Luke Wilson. Decent guy, decent actor, has had some good roles...a better and overall more versatile actor than his brother but hasn't always gotten the great roles. This on the other hand is the type of role that could launch into far more serious roles because he does an amazing job playing the macho leading man. He was so believable and emotional and just an all around terrific performance. Kate Beckinsale looking as good as she always does plays the emotionally drained and terrified wife and does an equally brilliant performance as Wilson. The two of them together are a tour de force and she is really very good...one of her strongest performances I have ever seen her in. Because of the terrific story that sets up their background and their characters they get such a wide range of emotions out of their characters both independently and together. Character actor Frank Whaley plays the orchestrator of all the mayhem and the 'manager' of the small hotel the couple stops at. Granted Whaley's character is a little stereotypical in every form imaginable but doesn't make him any less of a great adversary and scary as hell bad guy. Mention must go out to the two killers in the film who you don't see much of their face but they still make for impressive killers given their body language and movements Ethan Embry and Scott G. Anderson.Many reviewers will likely point all the predictable same old spots in Vacancy but overall there was just something very different about this film. It was done in such a perfect way and the performances were far exceeding expectations and there were actually a lot of legitimate surprises and like with any truly great horror film the ending is left open to worlds of interpretation. Is this person going to live? Is the other person actually dead? Apparently his first venture into English speaking films director Nimród Antal has no problem with this genre and creates just about as creepy a setting as you can possibly think of. I struggled a little bit to give a perfect score to a film in a genre where many believe it is tired and worn but I have to go with my gut instinct and how much I enjoyed sitting in this film and being glued to my seat and just thoroughly enjoying every aspect of it. I can't say everyone will feel the same but I can promise you that you'll get a hell of a good time out of this amazing thriller. 10/10",Vacancy

He puts two and two together and realizes the tapes are real and they are the next victims. From that point it is a lot of cat and mouse games. David and Amy find a secret tunnel out of the room and call 911, but of course the one policeman that comes is not too bright.

51,ironhorse_iv,"Not for the casual vacancy, still a OK movie",7,17 December 2012,"This movie wasn't the Bates Motel of horror movies, but more like the cheap motel of horror. It's cheaply made, but what they do with the resources they had is interesting. The opening credits use a very Saul Bass style. They're being creative with fonts and titles in the opening. The music was surprisingly catchy as well. The banging at the beginning was good, that created an atmosphere of tension. A vacationing couple, David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale) check in a nearby motel, when their car breaks down. This motel is run by a weird little night manager Mason (Frank Whaley) and the couple take the honeymoon suite. In their room, looking for entertainment for the evening, the pair finds a VCR tape. They put it on their television, and find it to be a low-budget slasher film. After watching for a while, they come upon realizing that all of the films seem to have been shot in the very same room they currently occupy. David and Amy suddenly become the stars of a real life horror snuff film. They realize they must escape, or they will become the next victims. The filmmakers sketch in enough of David and Amy's back story for us to want them to survive. This thriller is scripted by Mark L. Smith and directed by Nimród Antal. Nimrod use hidden cameras to track their every move, and takes the cue from Hitchcock opting for suspense over graphic violence and torture. Vacancy might not get Mr. Hitchcock smiling from above. But he won't be spinning in his grave, either. The film has a pure cat-and-mouse chase. The movie squeezes the maximum in suspense out of one location, as all the scenes are film just there. It runs through every permutation of the motel-hell concept. The film has a nice sense of claustrophobia, particularly when the couple discovers a labyrinth of dirt tunnels under the motel. Luke Wilson doesn't have time to indulge in acting when surviving. The roles of both can be judge by the amounts of yelling and running, not only between them and the killer, but with each other. The audience can really felt the distance between the 2 main characters in the beginning. Other than that the female character Kate plays is bitchy and Luke's performance was boring and wooden. I'm all for female empowerment, but I found Kate Beckinsale's survivor transformation a little hard to believe. Up until very late in the film, and after she stops being a jerk, she's usually whimpering in a corner. In fact, she doesn't seem to be able to do anything but follow her husband around. And yes, I understand that it's all about juxtaposition, if she wasn't fragile at first, her later transformation wouldn't be as evident later. Still, survival instincts can only go so far. Whaley creates a memorable cracker-barrel crazy man that borderlines modes his role on Dennis Weaver's jittery night clerk in the Orson Welles classic ""Touch of Evil ."" The film use subtle fright tactics: sound effects over gallons of blood, a shard of glass over a chainsaw which gives it props, but Vacancy suffers from too many horror flick clichés using killers in masks, cellphones that are conveniently out of range, etc. etc. There is still enough violence to warrant its R rating.

Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsdale play a couple with some problems that end up staying at a motel off the beaten track. It seems that business has been really bad since the new highway was created and bypassed all the motel's former business. What does a business do when faced with these problems? Well, invest in creating snuff films of course. While I found the topic really quite sickening and disgusting, I must confess that director Nimrod Antal and writer Mark L. Smith managed to keep it somewhat classy despite the horrific subject matter and execution. The acting is above-average for films of this ilk and the tension throughout is really unbelievable. This film should have you on the edge of your seat and bouncing out of it a few times as well. The primary antagonist played by Frank Whaley is much more complex than some suicidal, deranged killer. He gives a fine, creepier-than-average performance. A good, suspenseful film you just hope is pure fiction.

58,jzappa,A Masterpiece of Tension,9,10 September 2007,"Nimrod Antal asserts himself here as a masterful, gifted, rightfully confident director. Vacancy, the horror film that should've stood out in this year's mixed, mostly stale bag of slashers, has every effect a horror film should have. The cinematography not only depicts a creepy, ominous, moody feel but also knows how to capture certain shots that have a lot of darkness around the edges, the last shot being the prime example, and others being translucent shadows racing across the frame of a window or only barely visible in the background. The opening credits are some of the most inventive and subliminally tone- setting in recent films, overscored by the brilliant, multi-layered music score. Antal's patient, incidental use of violence is truly terrifying and stunningly, stunningly real. Vacancy is fueled by an unyielding, helplessly engrossing suspense and squeezing tension.Luke Wilson shows great extent as an actor here, playing a very well-depicted dominant, communicating, assured half of an unhappy traveling couple, to which Kate Beckinsale emotes perceptively as the moody, resentful other half whose eggshells Wilson has become fed up with walking on. Frank Whaley, an actor who I truly believe is impossible to read for sure, is a perfect choice for the role of the hotel clerk.It has become quite difficult for even the most knowing and discerning filmgoers to pick out the right horror films these days, and the shining of the true colors of the genre each year become less visible.

Sad to say that due to plenty of unconvincing character portrayals and some very bad choices in this story's twists and turns, Vacancy quickly deteriorated into an unintentional slapstick comedy where this cat & mouse game was about on par with that of a Tom & Jerry cartoon.The one thing that really surprised me about Vacancy was that it had been given a ""restricted"" rating, yet it did not contain any over-the-top gore to speak of (which, in the long run, actually might have helped move this one's story along to some degree).",Vacancy

63,FilmCriticLalitRao,American début of Hungarian cinéaste Nimrod Antal,8,14 September 2008,"Nimrod Antal is a talented director from Hungary whose first feature film ""Kontroll"" captivated viewers' attention all over the world.It is rather bizarre that his latest film ""Vacancy"" is devoid of Hungarian elements.This is somewhat shocking in a way as most film directors try to incorporate elements which are closer to them in their films.Motels are an important element of American culture.It is impossible to imagine lives of ordinary American citizens without them.They are also important for innumerable tourists who choose to stay after a tiring day.It is rather unfortunate that some films like Psycho have portrayed them in bad light.Vacancy is a film that tries to convey that motels are bad places as in some of them we see the worst kind of depravity of human mind.Vacancy is a hard to classify film.One is not sure whether it can be called a horror film or a thriller film.All that can rightly be said is that it is simply an intelligent film for which Hungarian director Nimrod Antal has depicted the perverse role of video in our daily lives.In the film there is shock for viewers as a video library full of snuff films is shown which inadvertently suggests that some motels have gained bad reputation of being houses of death.Vacancy is also a film about troubled relationships and mood swings of a young urban couple which is passing through a bad phase of their lives.The best thing about ""Vacancy"" is the depiction of an intelligent mind game which allows a trapped couple to escape from the clutches of villains.It is expected that more couple will play such games in order to save their skins in case they are trapped in a similar situation as depicted in ""Vacancy"".",Vacancy
64,MBunge,Proof that modern horror doesn't have to be torture porn,7,24 May 2011,"I've watched a lot of bad movies. Some have been so bad they were good. Most have just been really, really, reeeeeaaaaaly bad. But just as starvation and thirst can make food and drink taste better, viewing a lot of awful films makes the good ones even better. Vacancy is one of the good ones. It is suspenseful, surprising, propulsive and even a bit classy. I t proves you can make a horror movie with modern levels of brutality without it becoming torture porn.David and Amy Fox (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) are a married couple, but they haven't been happy about it for a while. Their young son was killed in an accident and their love died with him. Now, they're just circling each other around the open grave of their marriage, waiting for each other to jump in. David and Amy are the sort of failed couple who can't even yell at each other any more. When they fight with each other, it's like they're just complaining about the weather.Driving back from the anniversary celebration of Amy's parents, they get lost on the back roads of California. Their car breaks down and they decide to spend the night at a road side motel. The manager (Frank Whaley) is an odd fellow, but isn't that the sort of guy who winds up being the night manager of a road side motel? When David and Amy get into their motel room and find video tapes showing people being murdered in that very room, they realize the manager is far more than odd. He's a vicious killer who makes ""snuff films"" and intends on David and Amy being the stars of his next production.I truly liked this movie. It is very much built out of well established conventions of the horror genre but it proves that if you take those conventions seriously and execute them well, they'll still work. There's no self-referential irony or jaded genre commentary at work in Vacancy. It's the pure and joyous fear of being trapped, not knowing what's going on and seeing a guy with a mask and a knife step out of the shadows.One of the best things about it is that is knows and shows the value of restraint. There's some pretty terrible things that happen in this story, but it doesn't wallow in the suffering and misery. Vacancy doesn't try to titillate you with pain and death. These filmmakers want to keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see if David and Amy survive. They don't want to excite or arouse you waiting to see what horrible thing happens to them next. Too many horror films are like porn. They build the excitement for a few minutes and then it's released when someone gets their head chopped off, blood spurting everywhere. By eschewing those cheap, visceral thrills, this movie is able to keep the tension taught from almost the very beginning to almost the very end.Another thing that draws you into the story is that these killers don't have super-ninja powers. They can't see things they shouldn't be able to see, hear things they shouldn't be able to hear or do things human beings shouldn't be able to do. The manager does try to plan out the murders of David and Amy like a film director planning out his shooting schedule but when thing go wrong, he doesn't have any more idea what he's supposed to do next than David or Amy. This isn't about designated victims cowering before designated victimizers. Vacancy is more a struggle between equals; those who want to kill and those who want to survive. Because the killers aren't always two steps ahead of David and Amy, it gives an uncontrived energy to the story. In most horror movies, you're just waiting until someone gets killed. In Vacancy, you're waiting to see them escape. There's a very big and refreshing difference between those two sensations.The acting here is pretty good. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are very believable and relatable as people who suddenly find their ordinary problems overwhelmed by extraordinary danger. There's also a smart consistency to their performances. Amy blames herself for their death of their son and wants to give up on their marriage and that's how she responds to the threat of the killers. David has worn himself out fighting to keep his marriage alive and he brings that same determination and optimism to staying alive. Frank Whaley also does a superb job as the manager. He proves that a human evil which feels real emotions like frustration and anger and fear is far more terrifying than an unknowable, inhuman monster.At only 85 minutes long, Vacancy is a little too short and straight ahead to be a roller coaster. It's more like one of those rides where you're slowly lifted up into the air and then dropped like a rock back down to the ground. If you want to see a movie that can grab you by the throat while not making you feel embarrassed about what you're watching, give this one a try.",Vacancy
65,mattkratz,good movie,8,24 August 2008,"This movie provided an interesting (and unexpected) twist on and old movie formula. A bickering couple's car breaks down in the middle of the night, and they wind up in a sleazy motel with a creepy owner. They decide to entertain themselves by watching some tapes in the room, and these tapes turn out to be snuff films. They then realize that the films were shot in that very room after they discover the hidden cameras, and wind up spending the remainder of the film trying to escape the bad guys who want to make them the stars of the next film. I thought the movie was suspenseful and entertaining. You might like it if you're into suspense movies:this one is good in being slightly different.

66,lukem-52760,Best Film That Luke Wilson Has Ever Made.,8,28 December 2019,"I loved ""Vacancy"" & it's really cool one location setting & it's gripping atmosphere & simple story.""Vacancy"" is definitely crafted to be an old fashioned 60's or 70's style suspense Thriller with that creepy stalk 'n' slash tone of the Classic's like Psycho.What stands out is the amazing production design, the look of the old motel is grimy & rundown & looks like it stood still in time from the 1960's & it really does look Awesome!!!The story is nice & simple & serious with our troubled older couple & not teens, who break down on some deserted back roads out in the middle of nowhere & have to stay the night at the only motel around or they could find & find out it's a place for sicko's to film Snuff films there by killing off their guests. That's basically the story but there's nice dramatic character depth here too as we find out the depressed & troubled couple have lost a child & can't reconnect or get over it which you wouldn't so it's done very real & our couple are played by Kate Beckinsale who is great here & Luke Wilson who is also great here in a proper serious role for once, i much prefer him doing serious rather than his usual weird un-funny indie comedies just like his brother Owen Wilson both better at serious than silly & goofy!!!Luke Wilson plays an average middle-aged guy struggling with the loss of his kid & he gives a good solid performance as does Kate Beckinsale & they work well together.Now this is definitely a gripping intense suspense Thriller with some sick Snuff stuff & some really sinister weirdo killers that are trying to hunt & kill our couple as well as film it too.The tables get turned & the blood spills, i loved this little claustrophobic Thriller & it's one of those films where you can see it could happen & probably has happened before?There's nothing far fetched & it's all kept tight & tense & like i said i was very impressed with Luke Wilson here as the ordinary man pushed to fight for his wife & his life & survive the night but Kate Beckinsale becomes a tougher hero than him.The music score is also excellent.One hell of a good Slasher Thriller.",Vacancy

68,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Surprisingly great,7,24 March 2016,"The strongest asset that Vacancy has going for it is a deliciously tense and artistic set of opening credits. Now that can be seen as an insult in a review by some, but I'm happy to report that following that terrific opening is a nasty little flick that delivers the genre goods nicely. It's nothing new or noteworthy, but it tries, and commits itself to its macabre little setup pretty well, leaving us with a slice of suspenseful horror in the tradition of stuff like The Strangers and Psycho. The aforementioned credits are a scintillating parade of impressive graphic design accompanied by a heart-skipping, nerve clawing score by Paul Haslinger, formerly of Tangerine Dream. This sets the tone for the events to follow, in which Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson play an unfortunate couple whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere at the witching hour, forcing them to take refuge at one of the countless ominous, isolated motels which populate cinematic Americana. The first red flag is the desk clerk, a twitchy little weasel played by Frank Whaley. Whaley is best known as the guy who provoked the wrath of Samuel L. Jackson by saying 'what' one more goddamned time in Pulp Fiction. Here he milks his squirmy, freakazoid role for all its worth, treating the couple with all the good natured charm of a king cobra. Beckinsale and Wilson settle in for the night and are almost immediately descended upon by masked psychos who prowl the property and leer outside their windows. So begins the archetypal cat and mouse game of survival, as the two evade a group of marauding sickos who have been preying on unsuspecting guests for a long, long time. The two leads are solid, especially Beckinsale who let's the fear cord rip in certain impressive moments. Whaley steals his scenes and gets under your skin. It's standard horror done pretty darn well. Recommended.",Vacancy
69,drownnnsoda,"Tense, Suspenseful, and Solid Shocker.",9,28 April 2007,"""Vacancy"" is a suspenseful horror shocker that follows a young disputing couple on their way home from an anniversary party, Amy and David Fox (Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson), who have just recently lost a child and are about to enter a divorce. The bickering couple end up stranded outside a small service station in the middle of nowhere, and decide to to check into the Pinewood motel, a cheap little place for them to spend the night until they can get help the next morning. The quirky desk clerk gives them their room, and they find it to be a complete dump. But their dingy motel room is the least of their problems, when they find videotapes of homemade snuff movies where previous guests were filmed as they were brutally murdered. With a team of masked killers surrounding the entire motel, and every area under surveillance, Amy and David find themselves in a life-or-death struggle as they try and survive through the night.If the plot summary for this movie sounds like something that interests you, you will more than likely enjoy this suspenseful horror flick. I went into ""Vacancy"" with pretty average expectations - I wasn't that wild about this movie when I'd first heard about it, but it sounded interesting enough so I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. Unlike the vast majority of the horror junk that gets released lately, this film actually boasts an original and solidly-constructed premise. Take some elements from Hitchock's ""Psycho"" (was it just me, or were those opening credits played over with the Bernard Herrman-like score a direct reference to Hitchcock?), throw in some aspects from the ""Saw"" series, and tie things together in a tense little package, and you get ""Vacancy"". I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout almost the entire film, and found not one dull moment. Suspense and tension are the real kickers in this movie, and it is done very well. Lots of moody camera angles and some genuinely frightening sequences (take the underground cave scenes for example) add to the tense nature.Our lead performers are Beckinsale and Wilson, both of whom turn in some great performances. Wilson plays the ""husband hero"" and Beckinsale is the ""damsel in distress-gone fighting machine"", and both capture this effectively. Their acting is believable, and I think that the writing has something to do with it as well, because their characters are written really well. They're not your typical genre morons who drop to the floor when the killer approaches, they are much more real. They make good decisions and the right moves, which makes them much more credible and realistic, winning over the audiences sympathy rather easily. There were some heart-pumping fight sequences as well between the heroes and the villains, which were well executed and had you rooting for Beckinsale and Wilson. The ending was a little uneven I have to admit, but compared to the tense hour and twenty-five minutes before it, it doesn't come close to bringing the movie down.Overall, ""Vacancy"" is an original horror flick that is heavy on suspense, while not so heavy on bloodshed. The claustrophobic atmosphere and the tense build up in this movie is it's real charm, and it will have you on the edge of your seat, anxious to see what will happen next. It's the way a thriller should be done, and makes for an enjoyable late-night fright fest. Exceeded my expectations and went beyond. 9/10.",Vacancy
70,davispittman,Entertaining horror film,7,27 April 2017,"Vacancy is a horror movie that is worth checking out. It's pretty entertaining and it's well acted. The film stars Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson. They plays a married couple that checks into a motel one night and things quickly turn south. They discover that they are being filmed in their room and that the owners plan on making a snuff film with them being the victims. They find the previous tapes containing horrible torture inflicted upon the victims who stayed in that room. The acting is good, I enjoyed both Beckinsale and Wilson's performances. They were convincing in their roles and played a convincing couple. The suspense and tension is high in the majority of the film, the scares are average. To me, this film isn't really all that scary as much as it is suspenseful and thrilling. The writing is average for this kind of movie. It's not full of great talented dialogue, but it's not bad at all. I was satisfied with the script, I thought it provided the audience with everything that is needed. It doesn't really strive to be the best, but you do see that the filmmakers did give a good amount of effort, they and the actors both really did give it their best shot. At the end of the day, it's not going to go down as a legendary horror movie, but it will entertain and it accomplished what it set out to accomplish. 7/10.",Vacancy
71,3xHCCH,"No Big Deal, But Exciting While It Lasted",6,15 July 2007,"I have not heard anything about ""Vacancy"" when I watched it, except that it was a horror movie. Most probably of the B variety, I thought to myself. But I was surprised that it had name stars in it. Luke Wilson is an actor I have admired since his guest role on the X-Files. I felt he deserved as big a stardom as his brother Owen seems to have. Kate Beckinsale, I admit I found her to be a bland forgettable beauty in Pearl Harbor, where I first heard of her. But after Underworld, I found a new respect for her.So I went ahead and watched it. It was quite a straightforward horror film, with a lot of the familiar clichéd scares. You know, young couple whose car broke down goes into an isolated beat-up motel in the middle of nowhere, in the dead of the night. The actors really lifted this film above mediocrity. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale really delivered on the acting aspect, as the couple going through a divorce, caught in what may be the last night of their lives. The exciting tense situations are there, as well as the claustrophobic atmosphere.However, the ending came so abruptly. Never saw it coming so soon.

73,fertilecelluloid,Worth checking into for its atmosphere alone,7,15 July 2007,"""Vacancy"", directed by Nimrod Antal, is an atmospheric, suspenseful horror flick that made me think Hitchock's ""Psycho"" would have looked like this had it been shot in color. Frank Whaley is Mason, a psycho who runs a motel out in the middle of nowhere. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale play an unhappy couple who are forced to lodge at the motel for the night. As soon as they settle in, the terror begins, and we discover that Whaley and his faceless cohorts spend most of their spare time terrorizing -- and videotaping themselves terrorizing -- couples who stay at the motel. There is nothing particularly new or original here, but Andrzej Sekula's stunning photography and Antal's efficient direction result in a solid thriller. Writer Mark L. Smith seems content not to explain exactly why the villains are doing what they're doing. I guess they watch their little snuff films over and over again, like porno, and get off on them. I can buy that explanation because most men are motivated by sex, just as most women are motivated by security and producing offspring. I must confess that I am not a fan of Luke Wilson's, but he impressed me here playing a believable guy married to an all-too-believable bitch. ""Vacancy"" is not a gory film, and it's not a ""Saw"" rip-off, either; it has more in common with films like ""Joy Ride"" and ""Breakdown"" (both solid thrillers). The poster art reminds me of the cover of an 80's horror novel called ""The Sweetwater Inn Motel"". Don't expect a masterpiece and you'll enjoy the show.",Vacancy
74,ptb-8,Vacancy: the space between the film maker's ears,1,12 December 2008,"This vile American cinema-trocity is yet another excuse to show degrading cruelty as some sort of Friday night popcorn fun experience for impressionable teens to be further de sensitised to misogynist movie brutality. Is Kate Beckinsdale or Luke Wilson so poor that they need to make this film? What is it with Hollywood film makers and this torture porn filth? VACANCY is yet again a riff on Psycho but with pitiless violence snuff theme added. The DVD actually has the full snuff atrocity films only glimpsed at in the movie itself. This is simply some sort of crime. It serves no purpose except to shoehorn the idea of actually watching a snuff movie into the audience's heads. These films are made to look real. The closeness to seeing the real thing is so complete that it leaves any sane viewer with the urge to cry with despair. VACANCY is a disgrace. A vile idea and a disgusting result. It serves no purpose at all than to further degrade the (once) art of cinema and further adds to the keen-ness of criminal level film makers who want to enjoy profiting from an audience for this cruelty. Like the equally atrocious HOSTEL or WOLF CREEK, this imbecile brain damage movie is made for rapists and classmate killers in training.",Vacancy
75,Jonny_Numb,Creepy Crawlers,7,23 August 2007,"Nimrod Antal's ""Vacancy"" is the type of lean, breakneck thriller that is seldom met with success in Hollywood. Working with a limited setting (a motel/gas station frozen in the 1960s) and a compact script by Mark L. Smith, the film--like ""Phone Booth"" and ""Panic Room"" before it--turns a location into a character itself. In the process of finalizing their divorce, David and Amy Fox (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) encounter car trouble, and wind up stranded in the 'honeymoon suite' of the Pinewood Inn, run by squirrelly creep Mason (Frank Whaley, exuding white-trash menace); shortly after checking into their squalid room, the couple discovers a stack of snuff films atop their TV. Antal starts the film out deliberately, dropping hints of character detail and building up our sympathy for David and Amy, and just as quickly spinning things out of control in the last half. At 85 minutes, ""Vacancy"" goes by quickly, but does not shortchange character for thrills; Wilson, who has built a career playing 'aw-shucks' types, fares well as the Everyman husband/father, and Beckinsale (sans the ""Underworld"" S&M getup) exudes the proper mix of desperation and survival instinct; Whaley has a ball as Mason, a repellent character who has a few comical asides. In our current era of horror-film excess, it is refreshing to see ""Vacancy"" relegate most of its violent excess to the glimpsed snuff images, putting the accent on suspense and the terror of an idea rather than what is explicitly shown. This is a promising American debut from Antal--definitely a talent to watch.",Vacancy

One nice twist has the couple at serious odds with one another, instead of the usual young couple in heat. This gives the plot a sense of reality that such films rarely achieve. You'll recognize several supporting cast members including Ethan Embry and Frank Whalley. The film is pretty intense but comes to an unsatisfying and illogical conclusion.",Vacancy
77,p-stepien,This room is taken by Hitchcock,5,10 September 2012,"A troubled couple Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David Fox (Luke Wilson), end up lost in the back-lands of America after veering off the highway. After car trouble persists they bunker up in a decrepit hotel run by Mason (Frank Whaley), apparently addicted to the odd torture porn movie. Once holed up the pair decide to enjoy some time watching television, but the only thing available seems to be a couple of videos with low quality slashers filmed in seemingly familiar rooms, suggesting that they are in fact authentic and essentially snuff videos...Nimrod Antal moved shop to America after his highly successful adrenaline filled slightly surrealist ""Controllers"". With his venture into new territory Antal takes on the familiar with a Hitchcock inspired thriller much owed to ""Rear Window"" and ""Psycho"" with significant parts of the movie conveying a sense of distinct deja vu. The story itself does essentially seem more like a vessel to prove directorial worth, not as an original product worth really making and clichés of out-of-range cell-phones and broken down cars just highlighting the overwhelming lack of originality. After the initial set-up ""Vacancy"" it deftly introduced into suspense and the thrill of the hunt with eyes lurking and death uncertain. Managing to avoid plot idiosyncrasies it comes off as a mildly successful generic offering with some brisk action and building tension to satisfy basic expectations. Devoid of mindless teen slashing the focus is forcefully placed on family interactions of main characters and the suspense afforded by survival. Much in tune with the old thrill school of Hitchcock it isn't the violence or the kill that causes terror, but the anticipation of its occurrence. Featuring little to no real on-screen violence ""Vacancy"" nonetheless manages to grip the heart more successfully than Saw franchise movies.All in all Antal proved to be a competent filmmaker, but by avoiding any real risks to go outside the Hitchcock thriller supplied a movie destined to being nothing more than calling card for his future Hollywood endeavours.",Vacancy

More than this, he shakes his hand of panic looking like a drunk dram-shop addicted. And the main couple, why did they have to go back to the room every time knowing they were gonna be killed?

79,Matt_Layden,Watch This Film To See How Many Times You Yell At The Main Characters.,5,19 March 2008,"To tel you the plot of this movie would be telling you the plot of a hundred other films of the horror genre. Couple in car, car breaks down, couple goes to motel, motel people are crazy and try to kill them. So how does Vacancy try to step out of the conventional horror genre it has already set itself up as? Why not cast Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale...oh yeah, they are being killed for a snuff film too.Vacancy isn't so much a film, as it is an exercise. It's an exercise in the genre of horror. It doesn't amount to anything, it simply exists to see what they could do with film. It's not good enough to be classified as experimental and not crappy enough to be called B movie trash. Hell, it's only 85 minutes long. It's a film that has both positives and negatives and if you take it with a grain of salt, you can have a lot of fun with it.The negatives this film has can be turned into positives if you're willing. That is of course if you don't take this film too seriously. It has all the horror clichés, broken down car, creepy hotel, creepy guy, cell phone that doesn't work. These little things seem to be mandatory in horror films these days that involve slashers. So where does Vacancy separate itself from other slasher films? It has no teens in it. Instead we get a married couple who are getting a divorce. Unfortunately, we hate them just as much, if not more then any teen in any teen slasher.These two characters do a lot of stupid things. Who goes down a tunnel not knowing where it leads, especially when the people trying to kill you use it. Who breaks a mirror to use a sharp piece as a weapon....and not use it. Hell, I was yelling at him for not using the shower curtain rod as a weapon. I never cared for these people at all, Wilson is miscast and Beckinsale is irritating. She looks good, but looks aren't everything. I couldn't cheer for them to live, but I couldn't really cheer for them to die either. For some strange reason I found many scenes to be suspenseful. It's an odd feeling when you don't like the main characters. Aside from the desk clerk, the bad guys are basically faceless mutes. Their reasoning for doing what they are doing is never mentioned. I can only guess they make these sick videos for some sick truck drivers. The snuff film aspect was a nice addition and it set up for some good tension, but it never delivers on that initial tension.It sets itself apart as much as it could, but falls into its own tricks. It doesn't have the gore that other films these days have, but the actions from characters are so clichéd that whatever it tried to do to set itself apart is meaningless. Vacancy doesn't go to the twist ending route, nor does it try to go out on a downer. It simply ties everything in a nice little bow. It cheats the audience. The film would have been stronger had it ended with a death, and not a cop out.While Vacancy isn't as bad as people have said it was, it isn't great either. As previously mentioned, it isn't so much of a film as it is an exercise in a specific genre. It does well in some areas and fails greatly at others.",Vacancy
80,moviewizguy,Quite Possibly The Best Horror Movie Of This Year!,9,23 September 2007,"David and Amy Fox find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere when their car breaks down. Luckily, they come across a motel with a TV to entertain them during their overnight stay. However, there's something very strange and familiar about the Grade-Z slasher movies that the motel broadcasts for its guests' enjoyment. They all appear to be filmed in the very same room they occupy! Realizing that they are trapped in their room with hidden cameras now aimed at them filming their every move, David and Amy desperately find a means of escape through locked doors, crawlspaces and underground tunnels before they too become the newest stars of the mystery filmmaker's next cult classic!This is my definition of a true horror movie: A movie that scares the audience with thrills and suspenseful or tense scenes. Is this a true horror movie? If yes, it's one of the best in many years. If no, it's still one of the best films ever made that can pull off the suspense.Before saying anything else, I would like to state the beginning credit scene is so terrific! It really sets you up of what's going to happen in the next eighty minutes. Now, was this movie original? No, not at all. Honestly, there are some scenes where the characters actually do the same stupid mistakes that any other character in a horror movie does.But that fills like, what, five percent of the movie? The other ninety five percent of it is filled with fast-paced, tense, suspenseful, or edge-of-your-seats scenes. This is what more horror movies need these days: SUSPENSE. Not cheap scares.The movie also seems very realistic, compared to regular horror movies these days. Kate Beckinsale's performance is great, along with Luke Wilson. And being Nimród Antal's first English film, I'm sure he'll be a great filmmaker.Sure, it's not that original, but if you are constantly being at the edge of your seats throughout the film, who would care? This made me think: Rarely any film scares me, original or not but I think Vacancy pulls it off just superbly! Yes, I'm calling this film the best horror movie of this year...so far.",Vacancy

83,xredgarnetx,OK if totally illogical,6,10 May 2008,"Why do I have the feeling VACANCY was rushed into production during the period that gave us HOSTEL, HIGH TENSION and whatever the latest SAW installment was in 2006? It borrows liberally from those films, and even echoes PSYCHO. But what we get is a TURISTAS set in the American Southwest. A stranded couple (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) puts up at a rundown motel in the middle of nowhere. They are the motel's only occupants, but soon enough an unseen someone or something is pounding away on their door and Wilson finds tapes of torture/murders being committed on previous occupants of that very same room. Turns out the motel owner (Frank Whalley) is a psychopath and has a couple of buddies who enjoy joining him in his favorite pastime, torturing and killing people and videotaping the whole thing. Wilson and Beckinsale, who should know better than to appear in nonsense like this, are soon doing their best to fend off the killers. This includes crawling around in tunnels under the motel. Scary in parts, but nothing makes much sense and the film feels very rushed, including the fairly predictable ending.",Vacancy
84,Maciste_Brother,"Vacancy, in plot, acting, scares or atmosphere",1,9 April 2008,"VACANCY is a complete dud.The story had potential but horror is the last thing that was on the minds of those who made this aborted effort. The opening sequence shows Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson bickering non-stop as a (unconvincing) couple who are about to divorce. Talk about setting the mood. They end up, like so many horror films, at a dingy motel after their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. At the motel, they realize that it's being used as a place to torture people, which is recorded on video and then sold to people who get off on that kind of stuff.Like I said, the premise had potential but the end result looks and feels like something made from Aaron Spelling. There's no script, no scares, no tension. The acting is average. And worst of all, the atmosphere is totally non-existent. Atmosphere in a horror film is important. Setting up the mood is 80% to the success of a horror film. If there's no atmosphere, and VACANCY is as atmospheric as an episode of LOVE BOAT, whatever happens in the story or to the actors, rings hollow, like this one.With films like VACANCY, the horror genre is almost all but dead today.",Vacancy
85,Sirus_the_Virus,"I know it's deranged, but...",7,12 September 2009,"Vacancy is a deranged film that is sort of like Psycho, but has a slightly different story. Vacancy is about a married couple who are on their way home from a family reunion. The couple are played by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale. The two are close to divorce. When they run over a porcupine, they have to stop at a vacant hotel. While in their hotel room, they start hearing bangs on the door. They go to complain to the hotel manager(Played by Frank Whaley)and he doesn't do anything and the knocking stops. Things change for the couples when they find video tapes. Once they watch the tapes, they realize what they have actually gotten themselves into. There were many other couples murdered in that same room. Vacancy isn't exactly an original film. It isn't exactly a great movie either. It's obvious and really deranged. The second that you see some characters you know what will happen. But Vacancy is a good thriller. It is suspenseful and thrilling and will give you the scares and fun that you want. i had a good time with Vacancy. It isn't quite as good as Psycho(Far from it really).

Anthony Perkins has been replaced by Frank Whiley but everything could remind a little bit Mr. Hitchcock situations.

87,film-critic,The Fantastic Mr. Fox & Wife Get A Room for the Night,8,23 May 2009,"""Vacancy"" is not your average thriller/slasher film. To the untrained eye, it provides nearly an hour and a half of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale just trying to stay alive in a sleaze-bag motel while being constantly harassed by the unknown locals. The film seems to follow a structure, it seems to be predictable, but then – it transforms into something diabolically more. ""Vacancy"" is one of those undercut films that blends the power of a modern Hitchcock with just the right twists to keep new audiences on the edge of their seat. ""Vacancy"", upon watching it a second time, is more than just slash and grab; it is a cineophile dream come true.In the modern world of ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and nearly anything Eli Roth places his name upon, it would be easy to see how this film would be overlooked. It doesn't have a monster, people are not dripping blood in every scene, and (the biggie) there is no major twist at the end. Director Nimrod Antal's sophomore outing is more about the style, the cinematography, and the characters than just your a-typical release of this genre. We are privy to see our characters prior to these horrific incidents, to understand why they are pushed, and despite their ability to just run away from each other, they stay – giving us a great hour and a half. To begin, the opening credits set the tone. Not since ""Panic Room"" was I stricken by the originality of these credits, and how they propelled me into a immediate state of nervousness. After this, we are welcomed into a car, a already tense filled car that keeps us on the edge of our seats even further. Perhaps Luke and Kate will provide a moment of ease in this ride, but no – quite a different approach than we have seen prior from these two actors – they are in their own zone, and Antal controls it. He makes us believe. He scares us, while never taking us out of that moment of disbelief. This could happen. Antal knows that, Luke and Kate give us realism, and we are set for a wild ride.The plot was strong – the acting kept up with the chilling score and Frank Whaley proves that skinny nerds can be frightening. Whaley commands the time he has on screen, giving us small nuances of this character that others may have forgotten. Known mainly for lower-budget roles, ""Vacancy"" demonstrates what happens when small actors get good parts (with great directors.). Finally, one cannot discuss ""Vacancy"" without drooling over the cinematography. Briefly mentioned above, Antal has paid homage to Hitchcock in a grandiose way by giving us these early shots of our characters not in the foreground, but symbolically traveling along the open highway. For the first hour, prior to the desperate need to escape, there were filmed moments that just stood out – i.e. the car ride, the discovery of the tapes, the walk to the motel, and even near the end – with the shot of Kate looking through the cracks resonated early Hitch. This is what small attention to detail can do for your film.""Vacancy"" is worth a second viewing, and even a third – it impresses me that I like Luke and Kate in their roles, and Whaley hits his mark directly. Antal's choice of music, cinematography, and leads prove his ability behind the camera, giving us a new twist to a genre that at times feels dated and recycled. I would recommend this film for a good fright – don't believe it is just another product of the Hollywood machine – it stands tall and proud.Grade: **** ½ out of *****",Vacancy
88,jaredmobarak,You can get another sparklerVacancy,5,26 April 2007,"Ah, a thriller that looks as though it could deliver on the promises of its genre. I mean, come on, we have Luke Wilson, a decent actor taking a dramatic turn, the fantastic Frank Whaley, one of the most underused character actors around, director Nimrod Antal following up his critically acclaimed Kontroll, and the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale to light up the screenI'll admit, I would have seen Vacancy just based on her involvement alone. We have some real nice talent here and a premise, while not wholly original, that could be just what the film needs. Truthfully, I was there for pretty much the first hour, and then it all fell apart, fast and hard.Wilson and Beckinsale really do a phenomenal job at creating their roles to be correct in emotion and action. The two have recently lost their young son to a domestic accident and are on their way home from an awkward family party to finally make their divorce official. With some nice witty and meaningful dialogue, we are shown a strained interchange on the highway as the two clash with patience wearing thin, only to escalate when their car breaks down just past a motel/gas station stop. They walk back and take a room to wait for the mechanic, played nicely also by Ethan Embry, to return in the morning. After some prank-like door knocking and strange behavior from the eccentric motel manager, the fun begins just in time. It is a flawless transition from the character building exposition to the point where Whaley's manager is found to be in on the snuff film that appears to have found its two new stars.What happens next is a series of cat and mouse chase sequences between inside the motel room and outside in the parking lot, along with the manager's office and gas station via an underground tunnel system. There is suspense and tension throughout and I was fully caught up into the action right up until Wilson opens the door of their last motel room. The couple was brilliant on screen as all the conflicts and petty differences from before slowly melt away into the love and compassion they have for each other's safety. I couldn't wait for the final thirty minutes to hopefully not screw up. Sometimes prayers aren't answered though.Vacancy's conclusion soon turns into the same run of the mill finish all this Hollywood-fare gives. The competent writing becomes rushed, almost hoping that if it finishes quick we won't realize the complete cop-out we are given for an otherwise marginally fresh telling of an often-used thriller storyline. My viewing was treated with some surprises along the way, but all that ends much too soon. Well, scratch that, it's not without ""surprises,"" it's just that those ""surprises"" are so predictable and canned that they have become commonplace. I would like to think that the derailing during the final third is due to producer interference because the rest was so enthralling, but who really knows? All that worked between good and evil, without many clichés or characters doing stupid things to benefit the plot, eventually turns into a thread of moments that occur only to proceed to the next point. Our entertainment turns to generic popcorn mediocrity with an ending, which is so odd that I had to stay until the end of the credits because there must have been more to it. Alas, and maybe thankfully, there was not.",Vacancy
89,thekarmicnomad,"Unremarkable, but somehow very very good!",7,17 March 2009,"The back of the DVD box reads something like; a couple stay in a hotel where they are forced to participate in a snuff movie. This is the crux of the film, there are no twists or turns, clever plot lines, subliminal messages about the state of modern life, and this definitely won't win any Oscars for originality. But the film is so well executed that you are literally on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. I can't put my finger on why it is so good, the lighting, score, acting, directing is all sound but unexceptional. Yet together it all somehow merges to form a genuinely edgy film out classing the majority of its big-budget rivals. From the opening credits you know what is going to happen and have seen it all before but somehow this film is extremely tense and we were all hooked. There is hardly any gore, and less is definitely more in this case as the small snippets of implied violence have more impact and forces your imagination to connect you to the film. I highly recommend this film as an old school thriller slash lower case horror. It won't blow your mind but will make you check under the bed before going to sleep.",Vacancy
90,MrGKB,"A tolerable, though derivative, thriller marred by banal ending...",6,20 April 2008,"...""Vacancy"" is partially redeemed by a notably whack performance from Frank ""Field of Dreams"" Whaley as the guy most likely to remind you of Norman Bates without a mother, along with some claustrophobic direction from newcomer Nimród ""Kontroll"" Antal and atmospheric camera-work from DP Andrzej ""Reservoir Dogs"" Sekula. What fails to redeem ""Vacancy"" is the script by neophyte Mark L. Smith. Basically a derivative of Hitchcock's immortal ""Psycho,"" ""Vacancy"" sports just a few too many ""oh, c'mons"" for its own good, mostly centered around the premise of a snuff film enterprise that's somehow managed to conceal itself while leaving evidence strewn about in plain sight. Leads Kate ""Pearl Harbor"" Beckinsale and Luke ""3:10 to Yuma"" Wilson do what they can with predominantly cardboard characters, but Whaley steals their thunder every time. I can't help but think that ""Vacancy"" would have been far more entertaining if told from the viewpoint of the three knuckleheads running the snuff film operation, perhaps as a dark comedy in which their best efforts are consistently thwarted by an otherwise hapless victim couple (I'm thinking Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara here).Be that as it may, ""Vacancy"" is not unwatchable, not at all. But, truth be told, you've seen it all before in one film or another, and usually done better, if not first. Once again, glad I found this one at the library and saved myself a few bucks, although I still have reasonable expectations for Antal's next outing.",Vacancy
91,vitaleralphlouis,A 12-Hour Dream Date with Kate Beckinsdale.,7,15 August 2007,"I fell in love with KATE in no less than two minutes in this movie. Often criticized in the tabloids for being too skinny in the Age of the Obise, her slimness contributes greatly to the ample beauty of her face. I've seen her in other pictures -- only one good film, Brokedown Palace -- but she dazzled me in this one.Aspiring born losers often dream of candlelight dinners and moonlight walks by the ocean and will likely never have a great lifetime romantic experience like Kate and Luke Wilson have in this film. Driving for hours and off the interstate, worn to a frazzle and bitching at each other with every word. In a low-population area which few will see in 2007, they find a gas station and one mile later the car breaks down. Hmmm! There was a motel back there by the station, a seedy dump with all 4 rooms vacant. Besides dirty water, dirty sheets, roaches, and no air conditioning; the real horror is just coming into focus when they find themselves the targets of three sociopaths.Luke Wilson will display the kind of tenacious heroism rare in an era of phony super-heroes and never lets his fatigue interfere with the task of outwitting these thugs and saving Kate's hide. As tension builds to sweat, they'll crawl through rat infested underground tunnels et cetera --- Kate looking dirty, sweaty, so sensuous.There's real tension in this film, and the filmmaker's had the good sense to let the story go on only 1 hour 22 minutes --- a proper length for a movie --- rather than the usual boring 2 hours plus.As for Kate, I had a beautiful girlfriend as pretty, as slender, and as hard-to-get-along-with as Kate, also born in 1973.

92,TOMASBBloodhound,"Makes you jump, but that's about it.",5,29 April 2007,"Spoilers ahead.If you're looking for a movie that will make you jump, then Vacancy will work for you. However, if you are looking for an intelligent and complex thriller, then keep driving down the highway. And don't be afraid to run over any raccoons, or you may find yourself in the same predicament as Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale.Those two play a young couple who find themselves with a broken down vehicle and nowhere else to go but a run-down motel just off a lonely stretch of highway. I'll skip their personal circumstances dealing with the state of their marriage and child, since they don't really add much to the story. After renting a room from the sleazy desk clerk (Frank Whaley), the two get ready to settle down for the rest of the night. The room is filthy, and it appears nobody else is staying in the other rooms. Almost from the get-go, someone starts loudly banging on both the exterior door, and the door to the adjoining room. This seems like merely a prank, but then Wilson discovers some VHS tapes near the TV that show previous occupants of the same room being killed by sadists. From this point on, Wilson and Beckinsale are on the run from masked killers attempting to keep them prisoner and eventually kill them.This film has plenty of moments that will make you jump. There is no question about that. The loud door knocking is very effective, and the masked killers are effectively creepy, as well. As the film nears its abrupt end, however, there are a few moments that just make no sense at all. First off, it seems to be taking the killers forever to get inside that room and finish the young couple off. Why wait until nearly daybreak? The longer you wait, the better the chance that the victims might escape. And when a lawman is finally summoned to the motel, he is quickly disposed of. Wouldn't the sheriff's dept have sent someone to check on this man after he failed to return or report back in to headquarters? And would these killers be so incompetent as to allow Wilson to lie in one place for what appears to be hours and not make sure he's actually dead? Once the sun came up, wouldn't they have tried to remove his body from virtually plain sight from anyone who might be stopping at the motel or gas station????? The film ends quite abruptly, as the killers are disposed of in somewhat routine ways. Sure, this film will frighten you in places, but it really could have been much better. Gore lovers will be disappointed, too. See it if want to, but don't expect a classic. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Vacancy
93,gregsrants,Welcome to Motel Hell,7,20 April 2007,"Another week, another one word title horror/thriller that leans more  towards the thriller than the horror side of the genre ledger.  Following hot on the heels of last weeks number one box office champ,  Disturbia, Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale lead a cast of about seven  in the taunt and effective thriller Vacancy.  Vacancy is a tight, well paced thrill ride about two separating  spouses, Dan and Amy (Wilson and Beckinsale) that have the misfortune  of ending up at a remote motel due to car troubles. The isolated room  for rent hole in the wall looks like a 1972 Trading Spaces project gone  awry and the disgusting carpet and wallpaper is only slightly  overshadowed by the cockroaches the size of a Chernobyl chicken that  scatter under the carpet once the lights are turned on.  Immediately, Dan and Amy feel uncomfortable as Paris Hilton at a  Spelling Bee, but with the morning only a few hours away and the car  left abandoned on the side of the road about a mile away, they decide  to grin and bare it until daylight gives them the luxury of finding  their way back.  Good plan? Perhaps. But this is Motel Hell 2007 and when Dan utilizes  the room VCR in hopes of entertaining himself with porn, he is quickly  aghast with fear as video tape after video tape reveals snuff films of  people suffering painful demises at the hands of intruders that seem to  be having as much fun as Hannibal Lecter did when skinning his guard's  face in Silence of the Lambs. At first, the tapes are looked at with  almost a morbid curiosity, but that soon turns to terror when the  unsuspecting couple decipher that the killings took place in the very  room to which they are occupying. Think of the scene in 1979's When A  Stranger Calls when she realizes the calls are coming from the same  house and you might have a sense as to the immediate adrenaline at  follows this revelation.  So for the next 70 or so minutes, Dan and Amy will try and escape from  the encroaching knife wielding psychos while utilizing horror smarts  and secret passages under the hotel flooring to survive the night.  Hmmm, where is a peaceful Hostel when you need one (wink wink nod nod).  Vacancy is one of those films that I wasn't expecting to enjoy that  ended up being a fun cat-and-mouse game where two characters are smart  enough to know what they are up against and what actions are in their  best interests to survive. Like Disturbia and with last years Red Eye,  the screenwriters for Vacancy seem to appreciate that average folks  don't always have to be out-weaponed AND out-smarted when trying to  escape the pointy end of a blade. Dan and Amy do enough things right to  keep themselves alive for the night and in turn, the audience plays  right along without the usual shaking of the head in disbelief that  someone would be stupid enough to play into the hands of their killer.  If you are looking for gore a la Hostel, Vacancy will be a  disappointment. The scares are primarily in the form of the chase or  some loud door banging that shook my popcorn to the floor. There are  scenes with plenty of the red stuff, but for the most part the horror  comes in imagining the unimaginable while rooting for the underdog.  But for those who liked Disturbia, Vacancy has all the elements of the  genre and more to provide you with value for the admission ticket. The  acting is pretty good (yes, I said it, Luke Wilson does an admirable  job in a non-comedic role) and the direction under a guy by the name of  Nimrod is  for the most part  lean and without many wasted shots.  If I had a complaint about Vacancy it would be of the small potholes  the film falls into by following the horror/thriller playbook. When it  is revealed that Dan and Amy are separating after the death of their  child (a story that is never really played out and completely  unimportant to the overall plot), I rolled my eyes wondering how such a  good film could fall into such a stereotypical misstep. So too was the  flashlight that needed the horror standard knock with the other hand a  few times to keep the torch lit Hmmm, ain't seen that before.  But when the sum of all the body parts are collected together, Vacancy  is a better than average film that will be one of those horror films  that when showed on TBS in a continuous loop during a hot summer  evening you will watch over and over again enjoying each sub-woofer  induced bang on the wooden motel door.",Vacancy
94,cchase,"""And Theeeennnnnn???""",7,4 December 2008,"It's my favorite line from the stupid-but-surprisingly funny ""DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?"", but it's also what I felt like screaming at my TV set at the end of VACANCY. Too bad, because director Nimrod Antal was on my ""People To Watch"" list after his debut, the crazy/cool cult hit, KONTROLL. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't sell out with his first Hollyweird entry, and until the 'non-ending' ending shows up, for the most part he succeeds.Luke Wilson and Kate (UNDERWORLD) Beckinsale star as a bickering couple, driving back from their ""last hurrah"" at her parents' wedding anniversary celebration. Divorce is looming in the distance for them, following the death of their young son and their ability (or in her case, inability) to come to grips with it. So that's how you can get your wife/girlfriend/other- half to watch this: tell her it's a chick flick. I mean, you won't be lying...it just so happens that this one is hiding underneath a horror-thriller.So you know what comes next...the usual 'impending car-trouble-that-leads-to-the- damn-thing-breaking-down', and of course, to the gas station where they first stopped for help, which also happens to be located next to a motel that makes the 'Bates Motel' look like the Westin. Now, here's where it gets the most original - and the most infuriating. I believe that good casting should strike a balance...when you hire actors well-known for the kind of roles they play, hey, make it a selling point! Everybody knows who Robert Englund is, and his appearances in BEHIND THE MASK and HATCHET were played up so that more of us would go to see them, or at least rent them. That's a smart marketing move. A dumb one is to cast actors in similar roles, then pretend like we, the horror fans, have no idea who the hell these guys are, thereby completely insulting our intelligence.So the guys in this case are Ethan Embry, playing the guy who runs the garage next door to the ""Pinewood"" Motel (as in 'pine-wood box'...get it?), and as the motel manager, Frank Whaley. I don't know what Antal and the producers were thinking, but both these guys have been playing a LOT of deranged nutcases lately...Are we supposed to be shocked when it turns out that they're the bad guys? PUH-leeease.Well, that's the bad news. The good news is that the first two acts would've made a great TWILIGHT ZONE episode in a much shorter version. Wilson and Beckinsale take stock of the really gross room where they've grudgingly decided to spend the night, and their ""honeymoon suite"" comes complete with a beaten-up VCR connected to the craptastic TV, along with a library of unmarked tapes.But when Luke pops one in, and then another, VACANCY suddenly goes all ""VIDEODROME"" on us, which is something different, at least. What he thought was going to be porn is just that in a way...but it's SNUFF porn. The tapes are a succession of people being brutally raped, stabbed and beaten (not necessarily in that order), but the most horrific part of it is not the atrocities on the tape performed by two masked men in black, but where they are doing it...in the very same room the couple is staying in...Crrreeeeepy, no? Even Stephen King is gnashing his teeth for not thinking of that one.So, now you know. The rest of VACANCY is the once-contentious couple's struggle to get away from ""MoHELL 666"" in one piece, before they become just two more dead suckers filed away in the snuff-library. The performances don't suck, and Whaley and Embry have gotten their feel for playing nutball crazoids down to a science. There's even a neat twist towards the end, where two characters switch traditional horror movie roles, (and I can't tell you which, but you'll probably like it). But that ENDING!!! I could give this one a solid '8' if it wasn't for that. I blame it on the scriptwriter, who should've made one or two more passes as this one before turning it in - even the usual lame-ass ""oooooh, there's another killer out there, time for a sequel!"" would've been better than what they wound up with. I don't know - you might end up liking VACANCY a lot more than I did. As is, it just skirts the PG-13 requirements, and the snuff film reenactments are just real-looking enough to be disturbing. But if you want to scare me and have me barely balanced on the edge of my seat, you gotta do better than that. One example: JEEPERS CREEPERS. Now THAT was much scarier, and the ending, hokey as it was, trumps VACANCY's climax by a mile.",Vacancy
95,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Almost brilliant,7,9 October 2008,"A good thriller or horror is one that most likely has tapped into its audiences subconscious fears. Even if the audience doesn't know why, they are still scared. In trying to see what is it exactly that made the film so effective, welcomes multiple viewings. ""Vacancy"" is a great idea that almost manages to get there. It is literally right there, just a few inches to go and it would have been terrific.The film starts with a couple traveling cross country when they run into car problems and must wait until the next morning to have them dealt with. Simple enough. They check into a motel and watch some TV... and that's when things get really interesting. And tense.The subconscious fear that this film taps into is that of being watched all the time. However, that alone is merely unsettling compared to what the people watching intend on doing with their subjects. For you see, the people who run this motel are homicidal maniacs who get pleasure from and conduct business by taping their exploits. On the surface that is a quite mundane set up - the psychos out in the countryside - but the film is more than just the surface narrative. In the age of surveillance in most public places - train stations, stores, airports, parking lots, etc... - it seems like this fear of an ever watching array of eyes can be quite real indeed.The main problem here is that the film clocks in at only 80 minutes and was presumably trimmed of violent content to this length. That leaves at least ten minutes that could have been spent delving deeper into the story. Director Nimrod Antal, who previously made the brilliant and atmospheric ""Kontroll,"" never quite manages to hit that same note with this film that resorts to much simpler scare tactics that, while effectively used here, can't push a thriller into brilliance by themselves. --- 7/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence/terror",Vacancy
96,mario_c,"Between ""Psycho"" and ""Hostel"", there's a ""Vacancy""",6,5 March 2008,"VANCANCY is a horror thriller that is worthwhile essentially for its tension and constant suspense. The plot is some kind of crossing between PSYCHO and HOSTEL, because it's set in an old motel (like PSYCHO) but uses the same kind of motive used in HOSTEL (though, VACANCY, it's not as gory as HOSTEL, not even close!). These guys used the motel to torture and kill their costumers, recording all on videotape, in order to produce ""real horror movies"" that someone would buy then It's really the HOSTEL background in an American's highway motel It has great tension and high suspense from the beginning to the end, however, the ending is too predictable, because there's no twist or even something new/different. It's a very straight and average ending. My score went a bit down because of that I liked the acting (the main actors did a nice job) and the soundtrack! The opening credits are great!

It seems like many horror films of late fall into one of two categories......'stupid'....or 'torture'. Vacancy carves it's own path with sharp direction, genuine thrills, and clever moments. The film plods through the first ten minutes and then starts cruising when our unfortunate couple gets into the hotel room. From that moment this film gets quite intense. THere were many cliché'd horror moments...but most of those moments had thought and plot considerations that made them justifiably realistic. The things that stand out.....nice brisk running time....I like that in a horror film.....genuine edge of your seat moments...you'd be surprised how many horror flicks today forget this is the point....razor sharp direction......the director here provides an edgy style that shows in his attention to detail and realistic protocol.

At first glance, Vacancy seems no different. The characters, played well by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckensale, spit venom at each other, not realizing that they are methodically being pushed into a corner by a couple of psychos, but once that happens, they realize just how much they mean to each other. It takes this horrible event, equally as traumatizing as the event that made them split up, to bring them back together. Sadly, the screenwriter feels the need to indulge in too much sadistic snuff eye candy, as is obvious by the DVD extra that shows an unnecessarily rough ten minutes of the uncut tapes. The couple is also separated towards the end of the movie so that the wife, who is on medication and was being carried through the ordeal by her husband, can break out of her fog. That's makes narrative sense, but having him get injured, forcing her to lead, would have made the same sense while keeping them together. It's a better than average buildup with good actors and smarter characters that could have used a more character driven third act.",Vacancy
99,Superunknovvn,Assault On Precinct 13 meets Psycho,7,8 October 2007,"""Vacancy"" is one hell of an entertaining movie. 90 minutes rush by in an instant. The movie makes no prisoners from the get go and sucks you in immediately. With its balls to the wall-approach it is much more successful than the sadly disappointing ""1408"", which has received far higher ratings on IMDb.The premise may not be the most original one. We've seen characters getting lost in small towns with creepy, murderous inhabitants so often, it seems as if every small town in America was a death trap. Still, the makers set this up in the most believable way I have seen, yet. It really felt like people could actually become so bored in the middle of nowhere, they start developping a lust for murder and begin preying on ""tourists"". Of course, the sheer amount of snuff video tapes seen in one scene near the end is ridiculously exaggerated. The killers could never murder so many people passing their town without drawing any attention to the hotel.That's one of the main flaws of ""Vacancy"". After a realistic set up with good character development (Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson hand in more than solid performances) the movie loses some credibility. The killers are in such a good position, their victims shouldn't have any chance to get away and yet, Beckinsale and Wilson cause them so much trouble throughout the movie. Then again, if the two were killed off right at the beginning, there wouldn't be much of a movie. Still, the whole thing could have been done a bit less obvious. The main bad guy behaves unintentionally funny all the time and the outcome of the final fight is a joke with director Antal almost destroying all of what he has built up before. The last ten minutes are really a letdown and when the movie ends you literally can't believe that this was it.Well, too bad these mistakes have been made, because apart from that, ""Vacancy"" is perfect entertainment and could have become a classic.",Vacancy
100,DonFishies,"Some great camera angles, but not much else in this stereotypical mess",3,4 January 2008,"Without going into too much detail, Vacancy follows the story of David and Amy Fox (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale). The couple is lost in the countryside, and their car breaks down. With no other options, they hole up in a nearby motel, where they need to fight to stay alive or become the victims of a snuff film.Truth be told, I was not really expecting a hell of a lot out of Vacancy (for whose title I am still rather off-put by, since there are less than twenty roles in the film, and only about seven of them are not just victims on the older snuff films). It looked like amalgamated pieces of things we have seen before, and really, that is all it turned out to be. The early character development of David and Amy is clearly stock material from any stereotype you can imagine, and the little subplot there is on their past history feels forced. You can tell right from the offset that the screenwriter is not a veteran, and the dialogue between the two screams of being amateur (with not much help being given from either of the leads). Even the villains are one-note, and are never really given any explanation for their motivations or even who they are (although Frank Whaley's manager character Mason seems a little too close to a poor man's Norman Bates, only without any mention of Mommy issues). The film's keen sense of obviousness, and little to no scares only hinder its script even more (not to mention the anti-climactic ending).But their relationship is the least of this film's worries. The characters' actions and reactions are just ridiculous in most cases, and logic seems to be the least of anyone's worries. Yes, you can say that in a real life situation that when adrenaline kicks in, anything goes. But the would-be killers, or so the film implies, have videotaped the murders of many guests. Would that not give the idea that they should have a better handle on how to murder these two fighters, or were all the other guests just stupid enough to let themselves get killed? You would figure with all the trap doors, unused rooms, videocameras, and phones (not to mention the darkened, shady setting), that they would know how to take out two people who have no preconceived memories of their surroundings. How then does it make any sense that it seems to be the other way around? We can easily write this off as an issue with the genre, but even the most bizarrely silly horror flicks employ some form of logic for their killers. They usually know what they are doing, and the victims are the foolish ones, not the other way around.The acting is also not all too great. Wilson looks lost throughout the entire flick, just wondering why he even bothered saying yes to such an atrocious project. He looks unenthused from moment one, and when his character is really getting dramatic, his style is off-putting and unbelievable. Beckinsale, although she is a much better thespian than Wilson, seems to be on autopilot for the majority of the film, randomly amping herself up near the end of the film for almost no reason other than the film's switch in focus. She too looks like she knows she is in a terrible movie, and wants to wander out. Neither seems to want any member of the audience to care about what happens to them on screen.The film's villains are not much better. Ethan Embry as the one killer is given lines at the beginning of the film and a few as the film goes on, but then has very little to do other than to stalk Wilson and Beckinsale. Scott G. Anderson, credited simply as 'Killer', has absolutely no lines at all to my recollection, and spends his time in the film walking menacingly, or attempting to look scary. So much for motivation or development. Whaley on the other hand, who seems to be the ringleader of this circus, does seem to be using a little bit of his character actor side, but is held back by the confines of the script. He looks to be enjoying himself, but only because his role is the juiciest and most interesting (and as mentioned, the most rip-offish).But what really bothers me about the film is how it screams of how much better it could have been handled. There are some really intriguing camera angles used at the beginning of the film, and some really terrific ones later on (not to mention some clever editing using the cameras used by the killers in the motel room). They breathe a great sense of style, and they give the film a certain uniqueness that I really did not expect. It was kind of impressive in some cases, but felt more like it belonged in a much better movie that people should actually spend time watching.The same can be said for the sheer idea behind the snuff film factory this motel seems to be. There could have been so much done with this idea (and almost is during one scene involving a trucker in the middle of the film) and so much more of a handle given to the near enigma it becomes. I feel like I am making the idea behind the murders to be so much better than it actually is, but had the filmmakers chosen another route involving the snuff films a lot more, this could have been a far better picture.As it stands, Vacancy is a movie with some great camera angles, an intriguingly unused concept, and a shell of a stereotypical horror movie. Had the script not been so amateur and had the actors actually cared, this could have been a whole lot better.3/10.",Vacancy

They check into a motel somewhere in the middle of nowhere and as usual in films these motels are a source of grave danger. They find that danger when the guy watches a videotape that was left in the room and sees people getting killed in what seems to be their room. Panic, chaos and disruption ensues. So far the setup for the story. Not all bad, just a standard run of the mill horror/thriller film.Thrillers only work when they keep you bound to your seat. Horror only works when it brings some horrifying events that make the blood curl inside the veins. Suspense films only work when there is a suspense build up that makes you want to crawl into the film to get to the next event quickly. This film, quite sadly, lacks most of all these and therefore does not qualify as a good film in any of the three categories. It doesn't qualify as a good film in any of the other categories either. It does have a few good moments and it manages to steer clear of the age old cliché at the end (which scored it another point for me) but it just doesn't hack it.The reason why it doesn't hack it: there's too many mistakes and plot holes. Just too many of those stupid moments in films where you sit back and think ""err, no, that's impossible"" or ""just do 'something' you idiot, instead of doing 'something else' and getting nowhere"".

It's about a couple that get lost and end up in a remote motel with some really bad people. The main characters are not stupid. They are flawed people with a sad backstory and even though they are scared they understand what's happening and are trying to fight their way out and survive. It's suspenseful, intense and truly scary and you root for them to succeed. The acting is great and so is everything else. The movie has a really scary atmosphere. The viewers can feel the fear, paranoia and claustrophobia that the characters have to endure. It will keep you at the edge of your seat.

True, she only wears one outfit through the entire movie, and unlike the fetish garb seen in ""Underworld"" or ""Van Helsing"", it's not particularly kinky (knit cardigan and a pair of jeans). Also, unlike ""Serendipity"" or ""Click"", ""Vacancy"" is not a catwalk posing as a romantic comedy. It's a simple movie really. One night, one place (the Pinewood Motel), and one plot line (a to-be-divorced couple in jeopardy). But there's something in the way she goes from spoilt yuppie bitch to scared girl to gun toting desperada that keeps you fascinated to the end, however lame. I was sort of hoping her husband was in on the game. I guess you can't have everything. Thumbs up to Vasilios Tanis, Kate's personal makeup artist since 2003, for the light yet finished look. Good lighting (cinematography: Andrzej Sekula). I liked the photogenic way the snuff movie makers die, as if they were in the closing shot of one of their own productions - clearly the ironic touch of Nimród Antal, acclaimed director of ""Kontroll"".

110,Danny_G13,Almost despicably bad,1,15 June 2008,"Tense horror thriller fails to present tension, horror or thrilling suspense.What WAS Kate Beckinsale thinking when she signed up to this? After being in the likes of Underworld, Click and Van Helsing, she clearly felt it was time for a change of tact and to make a foray into the world of dark horror.Instead she ended up starring in Vacancy.This embarrassing shambles of a movie features her and Luke Wilson - so at least the cast is reasonable. Sadly that's the only commendable aspect I can credit it with.Vacancy sees a couple being stranded out in a 'middle of nowhere' motel after their car breaks down.Before long, they're being hunted by a group of madmen in masks.OK, the first rule of any movie which employs the use of suspense is that it actually requires to be claustrophobic or tense. It must raise the heart rate and create mystery, intrigue and excitement on the part of the viewer. Vacancy was entirely vacant on this, pun most certainly intended.Secondly, for a movie which was supposed to err on the side of horror, there wasn't a horrific thing about it. Barely a hint of blood, barely a hint of violence - and I'm sorry but Kate Beckinsale in a fist fight doesn't qualify.And lastly...where exactly was the thrilling aspect? There was not a thrill to be had anywhere.I could overlook the implausible nonsense if it was fun - but this wasn't. It was staggeringly boring. There wasn't a moment in the movie where you gave 2 monkey's about either protagonist.And for a movie featuring a woman as beautiful as Kate Beckinsale, there was no attempt to show her off a little - she was perennially in the dark and looked completely ill at ease. Call me shallow, but you don't cast a girl like Beckinsale for her acting talent alone. And while her accent was impeccable as it was in Click, nevertheless, her presence in this movie seemed pointless.The direction was boring, and had no sparkle, and the main 'bad guy' was just ridiculous.This was absolutely pitiful and should have been burned in celluloid form before conception.",Vacancy

114,hasosch,The motel as a trap,10,2 January 2010,"As everybody knows, a house has many functions, the original one probably being shelter against a possibly violent environment. However, never ever has it been shown so terrificly how a house can turn into a trap, offering the whole series of imaginable brutality instead of protection against them as in Antal Nimrod's ""Vacancy"". That the American-Hungarian film director is a specialist of tunnels, one has seen galore in his biggest success ""Kontroll"" (2003) which is settled wholly in the Budapestan Metro underground, with tunnels, corridors, hallways, gangways, etc. Interestingly, also the Motel in ""Vacany"" is undermined with a tunnel, connection all strategically important positions for the ""film makers"".Another interesting question is why exactly motels are recurrently chosen for the Lieu De Crime, starting, as also everybody knows, with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960). A possible answer is that unlike regular houses, the rooms of motels are taken for a short-time by strangers: neither their neighbors in the other rooms nor the proprietor knows them, and in the place where they stay overnight, they are mostly strangers, while in the house where they normally live, their disappearance would be noticed quickly. Moreover, unlike hotels, where more people meet inside of the building, the single houses which form a motel are often isolated and as 1-level-unities spread over a wide field where it is much more difficult to react to upcoming danger than staying in a hotel-room and just go into the hallway in order to seek help. Originally created possibly for maximal privacy and utmost liberty, away from possible neighbors whom one could disturb or who could disturb oneself, motels therefore easily turn out to be more dangerous traps than houses are by their very nature.",Vacancy
115,Jerique,Showcase of talent!,7,23 January 2010,"Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale star in this flick and both do an amazing job.Disturbia and Vacancy give you the same vibe in their preceding trailers. However, Vacancy's theme was the only one who followed the trailers. Vacancy looks like a thriller with suspense and it is. Disturbia looked like a thriller with suspense and was mostly a romance with the thought of being a thriller.Vacancy starts off with David (Luke Wilson) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale) on an unknown road. Their car begins to have troubles when a man comes by to help them. He doesn't do much help as the car stalls and breaks down completely not more than a few miles later. David and Amy walk back to a nearby motel to get a room and sleep for the night. A moment getting into the room David and Amy have a prankster knocking on their door and calling their phone. David asks the manager to make the person next door cut it out, and proceeds back to the room. When he arrives back he watches the tapes provided by the hotel. The tapes have footage of what looks like the same room and both David and Amy begin to realize what they've gotten themselves into. After the fun begins, the chills begin to come and creep up your back as you watch intently hoping that they both will just make it out alive.I found myself wishing a few things, but I can't really say for spoiler reasons. But the fact that they didn't come true ... well, sorta makes this movie that much better. It wasn't totally cliché.Kate Beckinsale will definitely get on your nerves as she did with me and my friend. Her loud breathing would get her killed very quickly in real life. But considering its a movie, they allowed her to breathe that loud while keeping her relatively safe throughout.Luke Wilson is pretty much the leader/thinker of the two and the most quite. When it comes to the big showdown he takes the the award for the show because he was the best performance, by far. Luckily he got to kiss the beautiful Kate and star alongside her.Those two are mainly the only big names in the movie, but I did think that Ethan Embry looked a lot like Matthew McConaughey but I was wrong.

116,happyendingrocks,Check in and check this out.,7,12 October 2009,"Don't let the fact that the director's name is ""Nimrod"" fool you. Thanks to excellent casting and a nifty little premise, this tense and terse little thriller is a very solid offering.Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are both easy to root for as a stranded couple who check into a deserted motel and discover that the quaint little inn is actually a ready-made snuff film studio. As they are stalked by a merciless group of sadistic murderers eager to get them on tape, Wilson and Beckinsale make mostly intelligent choices, and the resulting cat and mouse game plays out in an exciting and satisfying fashion. The well-paced manner in which the events unfold also allows us to get to know our leads and soak in the very relatable combination of mishaps that lead them into the killers' lair. Thus, we ultimately end up more invested in them than our usual faceless genre-standard victims, which of course enhances our entrenchment in the chase.A rare Frank Whaley sighting certainly adds immeasurably to the affair, and he seems to have lots of fun throwing himself into his role as the hotel's creepy manager. Whaley does a fine job selling his facade, and even though we suspect from the start that he's up to no good, his unsettling charm is sufficiently misleading.Some nice details also spruce the rather simple story up a bit, such as a truck driver who passes through to purchase some of Whaley's unsavory videos. As for the glimpses we get of the snuff films themselves, the images are truly horrifying, but the film allows plenty of room for our imagination to fill in the blanks. Instead of assaulting the viewer, Vacancy offers chilling glimpses that build on the mounting tension and leave some unseen potential atrocities in store for Wilson and Beckinsale.The random brutality of the acts on the snuff tapes heightens their horrendous nature, and thrusts us into a nightmare that anyone who has ever stayed in a hotel can readily imagine. Too many modern film-makers rely on sexual violence to bombard the viewer with cheap alleged thrills, but since that component is never emphasized here, the lack of apparent motive actually makes the deeds on these tapes more frightening. A series of grainy rape murders would only dilute the horror elements on display here, and the film-makers end up with a genuinely scary movie by not resorting to torture porn tactics (are you taking notes, Eli Roth?).The lone misstep the film makes is gratifying itself with a last minute attempt at a happy ending. Since the film maintains an unrelenting frenzied pace reminiscent of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre once the plot kicks in, it feels like a cop out when we reach our ""look, they're going to be okay!"" denouement. After what we've seen Wilson and Beckinsale go through, no, they're not going to be okay, so the film would have more impact if it stuck with the grim finale it almost has.This is minor quibbling though. In the end, this film is both a good scary movie and a great way to spend 80 minutes. Far too often, neither of those options is on the table, so I'll take what I can get here.",Vacancy

Heading home on a long drive from an anniversary party, they bicker with each other about things both petty and significant. It seems that they are a married couple on the verge of divorce, due to the prior loss of their son and the overwhelming grief that accompanies such an event. All that is sent into a tailspin, however, when the two find themselves lost, in need of a mechanic and at the mercy of a motel manager who – for no other reason it seems other than that he is bored – makes snuff/slasher films with his unknowing patrons in the honeymoon suite. The couple must find a way to work together before they become just another couple slaughtered on tape, and, well, maybe they'll work on their marriage while they're at it.Director Nimrod Antal stacks his film with copious amounts of jump-scares and ominous mood, achieved mostly by well-placed sound-effects and an intense score. In other words, you're more likely to jump out of your seat/skin at the sound of someone pounding on the door than you are when you see a knife let into someone's gut. In the 85 minutes or so the film runs it never lets up for one bit. Showing considerable restraint with its bloodshed (especially for an R-rated flick), and leaving enough to the imagination, ""Vacancy"" has an old-school approach that fans of the likes of ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween"" may appreciate. The performances from stars Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are a bit dry however, with the true star of the film being the quirky and creepy Frank Whaley, as the geeky and sneaky motel manager. The film also has a bit-part for the under-rated Ethan Embry, but unfortunately, it's too short-lived to amount to much. One of the biggest mis-steps of the film, though, is that it gives too much away in terms of ""what's happening"" too early on, under-cutting the otherwise well-achieved and superb suspense that builds up. As it is, though, it's a memorable and unique entry to the slasher genre, with enough inventiveness to keep it fresh, and enough homages to the past to keep it feeling classic.

They have recently lost their son in some kind of accident and are still dealing with a fair amount of guilt and grief. Upon returning from a relative's house they get lost on a back road shortcut and end up at the Pinewood Motel with car trouble. Yeah, not the most creative or original opening but this flick has its moments.Anytime a movie has a creepy, rundown motel with an eccentric owner, obvious comparisons to ""Psycho"" will ensue, and nothing can top ""Psycho"", nothing! When our hero couple gets to their room, which is pretty nasty when it comes to cleanliness, things start to happen. Someone keeps knocking on the door and leaving before they can answer. Those bastards! The movie does build a decent amount of tension, especially when Luke's character puts in a VHS tape and it looks to be a homemade snuff film. And get this, it was filmed in their very room! The embattled couple must work together to get through this ordeal alive. Screw marriage counseling, people just need to be hunted by homicidal maniacs to sort things out.Seeing that they don't want to be the stars of motels new film, they try several times to escape but with no success. As the standard in movies like these, a lone local cop comes to investigate things only to be killed. The couple does find something in the bathroom, which could be called a twist in the story, but is pretty weak if you ask me. The filmmakers tease you with the possibility of a dark tragic ending but eventually chicken out and go for the completely illogical ""happy"" ending. This movie is not great, but it's not total crap. Like a lots things it lingers in the realm of mediocrity.",Vacancy
120,joemamaohio,My Review,6,21 July 2008,"Young couple David (Luke Wilson) and Mary (Kate Beckinsale) are on their way for a divorce after the tragic accidental death of their son. On the road they encounter car problems, and the mechanic (Ethan Embry) tries to get them on their way, but it breaks down totally and they take refuge in a local motel.Soon they realize this is no average motel, as David finds a video that shows people getting killed - in their room. Now they're being stalked by the manager and some of his hoodlums as they struggle to stay alive and make it out of their motel of hell.What I liked the most about ""Vacancy"" is the fact that it's not overdone with blood and guts. Most horror movies nowadays throw away the suspense and drama and replaces it with heads being chopped off, people being torn apart by archaic devices, etc. Even in its opening titles, ""Vacancy"" seems like one of those Alfred Hitchcock-style films, and the suspense is delivered from almost the first moment of the film to the climax.",Vacancy
121,springsunnywinter,Old story but good thriller,7,3 July 2007,"The story is really old about a couple driving and their car broke down, so they booked a room in a motel. They seen a few video tapes of people getting tortured & killed very brutally in the exact same room they are in and now they are trapped. But it was so thrilling throughout the whole film that it made my heart beat faster and kept me in the edge of the seat and its been a long time since a horror movie is made about a evil motel/hotel e.g. Psycho in the sixties. Kate Beckinsale was not looking as beautiful as she was in the Underworld movies but her acting was terrific. Vacancy is quite similar to an episode of a cartoon called ""Courage the Cowardly Dog""; the 10 minute episode is called ""A Night at the Katz Motel"" which was also good.",Vacancy
122,datorsiers2,Just mediocre,5,26 November 2015,"Nothing special about this movie, to be honest. Just your regular low-tier horror/thriller movie. The main characters are portrayed as dumb, hence they make a lot of irrational actions and it just seems cliché and already seen at least a hundred times before.It is not horrible, but this movie just does not stand and leave its mark amongst other horror movies, you are certainly not going to remember this film after a while, because it is simply nothing special.Even with a fairly short screen time of just 85 minutes it feels drawn-out, that is strange for such a short movie, in my opinion it is because we are not getting presented with much action for the majority of the time, hence this film just seems slows and its linear plot just makes it quite boring at times.If you are a horror movie enthusiast i suggest you to pass this one, since you will not be thrilled or excited while watching this. If you haven't seen many horror movies before, this might seem great to you and you might enjoy it very much. Depends on the person, i guess.",Vacancy
123,jessie-39,Kate Beckinsale WOW! Worth the price of admission,7,21 April 2007,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.The movie is only so so but Kate Beckinsale is simply gorgeous, gorgeous and more gorgeous. Seeing her is worth the price of admisssion. Why she would make this movie is beyond me and the same can be said of Luke Wilson. They are much too talented to make a movie like this. Skip it unless you are as in love with Kate Beckinsale as we are.",Vacancy
124,Rathko,Masterful Handling of Tension and Suspense,7,28 April 2007,"An extremely effective and solid horror/thriller that manages to overcome the completely generic script by first-timer Mark Smith by the sheer talent of everyone else involved. Antal is able to crank up the tension to an almost unbearable degree, and in doing so, reminds the audience just how rare it has become to experience real suspense and tension in a movie. Beckinsale and Wilson, neither of whom I've ever rated highly as actors, deliver performances far superior to the usual teen-friendly nonentities that typically populate such movies. They create characters that seem natural and believable, and as a result we actually care about them when the sh*t hits the fan. Production Designer, Jon Gary Steele, responsible for the beautiful glass house in last year's appalling remake of 'When A Stranger Calls', here creates a motel that for all its cockroach infested filth is a faded gem of mid-century Modern design, bathed in a dingy, nicotine-stained light by award-winning cinematographer Sekula.Unfortunately, the quality production is consistently scuppered by the annoying genre clichés and sheer dramatic laziness of writer Smith. After setting up a scenario that is genuinely terrifying (a banging door hasn't held so much menace since Robert Wise's 'The Haunting'), he seems to run out of any real ideas as to where to take the story, and resorts to increasingly tedious cat-and-mouse theatrics. Antal et al do an admirable job of trying to disguise the paper thin plot, and at times come close to succeeding, but ultimately we're left thinking that we've seen it all before, which is all the more frustrating considering the powerhouse first half.Despite the sloppy writing, 'Vacancy' still stands out as one of the best horror/thrillers of recent years and deserves a far larger audience than current box office stats indicate.",Vacancy
125,daggersineyes,Definitely worth watching!,5,15 August 2013,"This isn't the best movie you'll ever see, it's not even one of the best horror movies you'll see. BUT it's a nice taut, suspenseful thriller that pays homage to some greats from the genre but adds depth and colour to the run of the mill clones out there. Yes it's been done before but this one has a couple of innocent ""victims"" who actually use their brains and do intelligent things to help themselves out of the nightmare. Amy was a tad stupid & useless at first and made me yell at the screen once or twice, but she got better - in a BIG way!! I felt like it could have been done better, things needed to be a little more challenging for the couple - and the ending seemed strange. Almost as if there had been one ending originally planned and then someone snuck in overnight and hurriedly replaced the ending before it was sent off for distribution. **** SPOILERI really REALLY liked that they didn't do that cliché rubbish of having all the good people die to show how it was all so ""doesn't matter what you do you're gonna die anyway"" clever. I don't find those endings ""clever"" - in most cases I find them annoying & pointless. Eden Lake & it's ilk are a waste of time unless you enjoy seeing people suffer with no hope of survival just for it's own sake. Personally I don't. Anyway this movie avoids that nonsense only to replace it with a worse ridiculously far-fetched nonsense. The lame ending was not bad enough to stop the film being a fun ride and well worth watching.",Vacancy
126,kevin_crighton,worthing staying for,6,16 June 2007,"Vacancy is the latest horror/thriller about people being terrorized in secluded areas by locals. In that sense it's similar to the likes of Hostel, Paradise Lost, Wolf Creek, etc. However in this case it's not young people suffering, but a married couple.The plot is not the most original : a married couple break down on their way home and have to stay the night at a motel. They discover that the motel has a sideline in making snuff movies.. and they're about to become the latest stars....As I stated, not the most original plot. However, the couple played by Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson are well developed before the action kicks in. It helps in that for almost the entire movie they are on screen. This keeps the killers kind of in the shadows for most of the time, and means when various people show up, you are never sure whose side they'll be on. Frank Whalley is suitably seedy as the motel owner. The rest of the cast don't make an impression simply as they are only there for the killing or to be killed. This movie rests mainly on the shoulders of Wilson and Beckinsale and they are both good.The action when it kicks in keeps the tension level high, and as befits a movie like this, there is no humour. The cast and crew play it straight, right the way through and this helps keep things tense.Of course, there are faults with a movie like this. There are some plot details you could drive a truck through, and the end is a bit too happy, but I'm prepared to forgive it these things. For around 90 minutes this movie entertained me more than some of the bigger summer movies (pointing a finger at Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3) and also was more fun in the opening credits (which were cleverly done) than in the entire Hitcher movie!Book yourself in for an overnight stay. You'll enjoy it.",Vacancy
127,Ozzy2000,Not a very good film,5,6 July 2008,"Again I see other reviewers making comparisons with Hitchcock's great classic ""Psycho"" and how dare they put this piece of B grade trash in the same class. Indeed the idea of an off the main American Highway Horror scenario especially involving a motel has been done to death. I am surprised that an actress of Kate Beckinsale's , who plays Amy Fox the wife, caliber accepted a role in this 78 minute flick. Luke Wilson plays David Fox the Husband of a couple traveling on an American highway are undergoing a marriage breakdown after the loss of their child and you would have to wonder why? There car gives them trouble and they end up at the proverbial off the road Horror hotel where they discover that videos are being made of murders that take place in the room they decided stay in overnight.They soon learn the murderers have them lined up. The rest of the film runs at a frantic pace of chase and survival. As usual there are many frustrating parts where one wonders if they should have done something different to survive the ordeal. It fizzles out as one would expect with a relieving finish. Lets face it if you are going to have Kate Beckinsale in your film you should have much more sexual tension nonetheless good entertainment on a spare evening.",Vacancy

I had assumed it was a no budget, no name movie but was quite surprised to recognize the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, Luke Wilson and Frank Whaley. I'd never heard of Nimród Antal but damn, this guy can direct a horror movie without so many of the clichés that can quickly spoil a film. The movie in a nutshell is that Wilson and Beckinsale play an unhappy couple trapped in BFE motel run by psychopath Whaley. The fantastic thing about Vacancy is that the characters are intelligent and behave as rational people. I also like that Antal didn't rely on the cliché of the husband being an asshole, Wilson is actually quite likable unlike his attractive wife who cannot live with the accidental death of their son unless heavily medicated. With a short running time of 80 minutes and intelligent script there really isn't a reason not to see this movie unless you just don't like thrillers.",Vacancy
131,MetalGeek,"Decent Little B-Movie, But Nothing Mind Blowing",6,27 August 2007,"The breathless critic-hype on the back of the ""Vacancy"" DVD states that ""It's PSYCHO meets SAW!"" I'm not sure if I would go quite that far but based on its own merits, ""Vacancy"" turned out to be a decent enough evening's entertainment. When we meet the heroes of ""Vacancy,"" a married couple played by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, they're lost on some back roads in the middle of the night, apparently on their way back from some kind of family function. It seems that the bickering couple are planning to file for divorce as soon as they get to their destination. However, when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and they're forced to seek shelter at the grungy-looking ""Pinewood Motel,"" their attention is quickly turned towards matters of survival. Obviously the Pinewood Motel doesn't worry too much about their AAA rating, because the sheets are stained, the water is rusty, and cockroaches creep around the room. Worst of all, when Wilson pops in a video tape left near the TV, he sees a ""snuff film"" starring the previous occupants of the very room they're staying in. When unknown assailants start pounding on the walls, turning the lights on and off, and trying to force their way in the door, Wilson & Beckinsale spend the rest of the film's short running time (under 90 minutes!) trying to figure out an escape route from this ""Motel Hell."" ""Vacancy"" does manage to keep the suspense level throughout and though it's nowhere near as gory as you might expect given the ""Saw"" comparisons, the final showdown between Beckinsale and the masked tormentors will fulfill most viewers' need for some carnage. I found the ending to be a little flat but otherwise ""Vacancy"" was worth checking into.",Vacancy

""Vacancy"" builds up the tension and puts every piece together but to no surprise fails to deliver correctly, sometimes at all.

133,jamhorner,Cheking Out?,9,30 October 2007,"This is one of those movies that drive small, off road hotels out of business. I, however, enjoyed this movie too much. It brought be back to the day before monsters, supernatural and stalker killers. This movie was scary for all the reasons that do not fall under those categories, in fact, this is a horror that can happen to anybody if they are not careful and it clearly demonstrates that there are twisted psychos out there that make snuff films. Grindhouses were set up to show snuff films as well as sexual exploitations films. The film is about a young couple that incontinently checks into a hotel that's a stage for a snuff film production.What made this movie particularly scary, for me at least, was the whole scene about being stranded in a motel, miles away from civilization and knowing that you are being taped with hidden cameras. Further, to know that there are tapes in the bedroom that have real people being killed by thugs in masks and knowing you are in the room that the person died in. That is truly scary. Another great scary element is when the lights go out and something is violently pounding on the front doors. I can't describe how horrible that is to do that to someone. Another horrific part is when a truck driver stops by and walks to the trapped Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, and just when you think he is going to save them, no he is there for another reason. Or when the pair find the storage of all the films. If you are noticing a trend here, you're on the right trail. This movie did not need gore, excessive sex, mutants or even ghost to make it scary, it was scary because you as the audience feel a sense of helplessness in an extreme real-life situation. That's what made this movie so great and scary.I am a fan of Luke Wilson, to some extent but when I saw this movie I did not see an actor TRYING to play a drama or a comedy, I saw a great performance. Even though he still had a smirk on his face his performance was amazing and it really brought his character to life. I think that this movie, as well as The Royal Tenenbaums, really sheds light on him and distinguishes him as a talented actor when he want to be. Kate Beckinsale teams up with Wilson as his wife. She also does a great job in playing a woman over the edge. When she is scared, she really looks scared but when she gets pushed to far, her performance takes off. I enjoyed both of their presentation and it really brought out the actor and actress in both of them and hopefully if they can keep this up, their career's reputation would not be damaged.The only thing that took me out of the movie was how well planed and how elaborate the entire scenario was. Rigging the pay phones, direct lines to Mason's office and a faux auto repair shop. However, if you notice on the poster and the trailer there is a phone number that you can call and when you do it leads you to the Pinewood Motel where Mason's answering machines picks up, and if you listen closely you hear people screaming in the background. This movie is not a slasher movie, it has no gore, no monsters or ghost, the men behind the horror is real life thugs and hired killers. I love this movie, I thought it was a great film and a different change of pace for the horror industry.",Vacancy

This movie begins with some similarity with ""Psycho (1960)"" and until then is really good but after that it became like all the terror movies we are used to watch, and this is not a good one, I would say is just regular, it's a petty because ""Vacancy"" promised so much.The plot is about a married couple who got lost after they got out of the highway for a short cut and after their car broke down they walked to a motel and rented a room to spend the night, from that moment they are going to have real problems.I would recommend to watch ""Vacancy"" only if it's on TV and you don't have anything better to do.6 stars = Regular",Vacancy
135,manchester_england2004,Just short of perfect!,9,20 February 2010,"VACANCY is an American horror movie set in a motel.The cover of the DVD did not seem particularly enticing. And with the price being low at places without reputation for competitive prices, I expected it to be bad.I am pleased to say that my initial expectations were completely wrong.The 2000s was overall a sub-par decade for horror movie production with various ghastly remakes of classics forming a large portion of the output. And when it wasn't remakes, it was flat out garbage like HOLLOW MAN, JEEPERS CREEPERS and FEARDOTCOM to name just a few. VACANCY avoids the pitfalls associated with 2000s styles. There are no speed-ed up action scenes killing intensity. There are no characters who conveniently forget about their fallen comrades two minutes after they are killed. There are no bright landscapes that make suspense impossible to build. The ""jump"" scare clichés are jettisoned. And it pleases me to confirm that there are no, repeat no annoying moronic teenagers. This is a proper adult-orientated affair.Comparisons have been made to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, PSYCHO. Let me state the facts of the comparison. Both movies are set in a motel, have opening titles in a similar style and feature a sinister motel owner. The comparisons end there. The motel owner is not Norman Bates and VACANCY is most certainly not a rip-off of PSYCHO.The plot is as follows - a married couple become stranded at an isolated motel managed by a sinister guy named Mason. It soon becomes apparent that something is wrong - they find video cameras in their room and another revelation...Without revealing spoilers, that's as far as I will go on detailing the plot.Director Nimrod Antal is clearly paying homage to the master of suspense - Alfred Hitchcock - where some elements are concerned. The opening credits instantly bring back memories of PSYCHO. Also, the beginning where focus is on the married couple with their constant bickering is deliberately mundane, but executed in a manner that makes it both highly interesting and at the same time suitably misleading. This is also similar to the style of PSYCHO where the beginning was somewhat mundane for a Hitchcock movie but soon took a completely different direction. It is the intrusion of something more sinister into the story that takes viewers by surprise in both movies.The pacing of VACANCY is perfect. It sustains interest from beginning to end. The opening scenes are important in establishing the main characters and these work perfectly. The unravelling that follows genuinely packs the punch that it is intended to. The combination of sound effects, disturbing visual images, lighting and use of appropriate music ensure this. And when the action really begins after the first third, it never lets up until the very end. Why aren't more movies made like this?This is a movie about human monsters and the instinct for survival. Accordingly, the movie is brimming with cat-and-mouse chases, strange inexplicable sound effects, excellent camera angles, suspense, tension and atmosphere - all of which are proper tools for building and sustaining psychological horror. And all the way through viewers are kept on the edge of their seats.The blood and gore is deliberately minimal even though the level of violence is often strong and unrepentant. This harks back not only to the style of Hitchcock but also to movies like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE - another masterpiece that suggested much greater horrors than actually shown.The villains are genuinely menacing, cold and merciless to the end. Unlike Hollywood villains, there is no reasoning with these guys!The motel makes for a perfect claustrophobic yet highly atmospheric location for the action to take place. To make such a compelling movie using this one setting for most of the duration is a huge accomplishment and is a testament to the talent involved.The acting is mostly stellar.Kate Beckinsale delivers a superb understated performance. Unlike Hollywood movies where women just scream and run around scared whilst being chased by a ridiculous CGI creation, Kate Beckinsale's character behaves like a proper person in danger would. Yes she is scared but the first instinct of every human is survival and she reacts accordingly when she is in danger. Kate Beckinsale is a genuinely charismatic actress and this is certainly one of her best roles.Luke Wilson delivers a good - though not great - performance as the husband of Beckinsale's character. Instead of the cliché Hollywood hero, his character is a genuinely flawed individual who just wants to protect himself and his wife from danger. He actually has fear and the strength he has in defending himself is realistic without being overdone.But the standout on this cast list is Frank Whaley as Mason - the manager of the motel. From his first scenes, it is clear that he is a sinister character. But his performance is subtle enough to not reveal clues as to what his intentions are.There are a few flaws here that prevent it from being a perfect ""10"".The score of the movie is out of place. It sounds like something from a spy movie rather than a horror movie as other reviewers have drawn attention to.The ending could have had more surprises in store. Instead, it showed that the movie having sustained such a magnificent pace had run out of steam. In contrast, Hitchcock was great at creating endings as other reviewers have pointed out. The endings to PSYCHO and FRENZY were genuinely unforgettable.Finally, there are better actors than Luke Wilson for the role in question.Overall, VACANCY is a massively under-rated classic that is near perfect and has an almost perfect homage to Alfred Hitchcock. I highly recommend it to all fans of true horror. And I also recommend the equally magnificent VACANCY 2, which is a prequel to this one.",Vacancy
136,tiskec,Not Too Shabby,6,25 April 2019,"I actually liked this movie quite a bit. The acting was good and so was the script.I would've rated this movie higher if it hadn't been for some logistical reasons. For instance when Kate calls 911 and says they're trying to kill us, I'm sure more than just one police officer would've been dispatched to the scene, rather than just one deputy. Furthermore, when they shot the deputy, it was in the middle of the night. The movie progressed until early daybreak without any other police getting involved. You'd think dispatch would've been concerned after he didn't radio back in hours after going to a place traced by 911 stating they were trying to kill us.Other than the negatives, the movie was actually not that bad. It had a good storyline and a pretty decent concept and climax. Not a bad watch. 6/10",Vacancy
137,simonparker1990,Worth Checking In,7,18 June 2007,"Vacancy has Alfred Hitchcock's finger prints smeared all over it, in fact at several times, especially the quite nifty looking opening credits, seems a lot like a homage to the great horror maestro himself. Its true, that even many years after Hitchcok finished making movies, that his movie still stay in memory for longer than most of the recent Hollywood horror that has arrived. The Birds and Psycho are far more memorable than the House of Wax remake or The Reaping. Hitchcock's movies worked because he had great characterisation and also a great sense of atmosphere, you could sit and watch a Hitchcock movie and be terrified for half an hour before anything scary actually happens. The sense of foreboding and incredibly skilfully done atmosphere did that to an audience. Nowadays we get cheap jump out of your seat scares and torture scenes designed to sicken. Initially my thoughts towards seeing Vacancy were not great, the trailer looked alright, but my guess was it would just be another lame, modern slasher flick. So what a great surprise to say that Vacancy is a good little movie that actually has some genuine scares in it. The movie isn't gory, nor is it jumpy, the movie is unsettling and creepy. Now this is what a true horror movie should do in my eyes, if a movie can unsettle without resorting to jump scares then it is a success. Vacncay pulls this off, well it pulls this off for a majority of the time. The movie is an absolute success until the ending, at the ending it seems to flounder a bit and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. But everything up until the ending is a joy to watch.What surprised me most about Vacancy has to be the actual acting. When I saw the trailer and saw that Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson were the leading couple I nearly burst out laughing. For starters Luke Wilson is a comedy man, he's designed to make funny movies. Well when I say funny movies I mean if he has the right material as just recently I've found him as unfunny as can be. Kate Beckinsale just doesn't seem the type to be in a horror movie. But its this bizarre casting that pays off so well. Luke Wilson really proves himself in this movie, to the extent I want him to focus more on a serious acting career, he seems to be more at home here than he has in years with his comedy movies. Kate Beckinsale also proves herself admirably. The pair are believable, and you actually start to care for them. Wishing that they will escape the nightmare, hoping that they find a way out. Their performances are so much different from the usual stupid teenagers we see in horror movies today, its refreshing to see adults in this horrific situation. The villains of the movie are also quite menacing for the majority of the time, the hotel manager played by Frank Whaley is a good character. He's not on screen too often, but he does play a creepy little man very well.So what of the scares then? Well as I've said the movie is at times pretty scary. Not for the first twenty minutes mind you, that is dedicated for set up and too increase the atmosphere. Those scenes work very well and once again its refreshing to see genuine character development in a horror movie, made better by the fact the two leads are great. However, the minute the couple enter the hotel room the focus shifts. Bangings on the wall and doors begin, the phone rings with nobody on the other end. From that point onwards the movie gets terrifying, the bangings on the wall really starts to creep you out at one point. Once the big bad secret about the motel is discovered, after watching some tapes, and the lights suddenly go out. The movie succeeds in terrifying. After the lights go out I guarantee you will be sitting on the edge of your seats. The movie does a couple of jump scares here and there, but it focuses mainly on the unseen terror. The minute the bangings stopped you aren't relieved, you're even more terrified because then you don't know what the people are up to. Its this sense of terror that makes the movie worthy of a recommendation. Its nice to see a horror movie try scaring and unsettling the audience once in a while. Its nothing a hardcore horror fan can't handle, but it definitely will unsettle the general population of people.As I've said the movie isn't perfect. The ending being the major setback of the movie. After the brilliant set up, and the scary middle section, the ending seems to run out of steam. In fact it seemed like the writers wasn't sure what to do anymore and did a few obvious things and quickly ended the movie. It feels rushes and unlike the rest of the movie, unskillfully made. Its the ending that fails in making this a complete homage to Hitchcock, Hitchcock could deliver an ending, this movie doesn't really get an ending. The ending is enough to leave you satisfied, but in a movie that exceeds all expectations you expect more from the ending.Vacancy is a good old fashioned horror/thriller. Its only let down by its pretty disappointing ending. The run time is pretty short, making the experience short and sharp enough to pack a real punch. Its really worth checking out just for the brilliant set up and middle section. But the ending really does make the movie suffer a little bit. Still this is definitely a good horror movie, and more horror movies made in this style would be a welcome relief.",Vacancy
138,das417,A Dark Road Leads to Death,7,16 August 2007,"David Fox (Luke Wilson) and his wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale) are a couple lost on a dark road in the country. The situation is one that matches their relationship as David and Amy still struggle with the loss of their son Charlie. The marriage is on the verge of falling apart and already a divorce has nearly been finalized. While their family is unaware of their troubles, David and Amy can only turn on each other with each passing moment as the road before them becomes even darker and more obscure. Only after a break down near an old motel do the two find relief from a long day's driving and arguing over past and current grievances towards each other.Their breakdown has placed them near a run down motel run by Mason (Frank Whaley) who kindly offers them the honeymoon suite. Inside David and Amy will discover not only badly decorated 1970's style interior design but also a series of old VHS tapes that reveal to them the horror that is soon to await them throughout the night and the struggle they will face if they want to stay alive.Vacancy is a sheer thriller and doesn't attempt to hide behind any kind of deeper meaning or moral lesson. Mason and two other men are responsible for the murder of countless victims whose deaths are recorded on various cameras and sold to any buyer depraved enough to enjoy such things. While they can kill their victims at will at any time using various trap doors that allow access to each of the rooms, they instead film as much terror from their victims as possible before killing them so as to increase the value of their videos. It is a disturbing thought and one that Vacancy is able to play off well in a way similar to how the Saw movies played off the sadistic tortures of Jigsaw. Claustrophobic images of David and Amy crawling through the various tunnels that Mason's use themselves and the sheer panic that Wilson and Beckinsale are able to hold through the entire movie also give much depth to the concept of a young couple struggling to stay alive.There isn't much to Vacancy beyond the idea of David and Amy trying to escape but since this is a pure thriller it works. The question of course is how they will escape when it appears that Mason and his men have every part of the motel watched closely with their cameras. This is where Vacancy suffers a bit since while we know that Mason and the others will die as such characters often do, the plot is stretched a bit in order to do this. One other aspect that was somewhat of a plot hole was the death of a sheriff deputy that surly would have brought other police to the motel once it was known that one of their own went missing when he responded to Amy's first 911 call. However, these are details that should be ignored if one wants to enjoy a movie like Vacancy. The plot may not be too original or the acting great but Vacancy is enough to give second thoughts to anyone who is traveling down a dark road and spots a lonely motel and thinks about spending the night.7/10",Vacancy

140,ernesti,Tense thriller that lacks an original plot,2,25 May 2013,"I have seen far too many Hollywood horror thrillers that are too lame and made for the teens only and just lack an intriguing plot. This is just one of those ""safe"" movies that probably made a lot of money but deep down it's just another vain Hollywood product without a soul. That's why the movie probably got released worldwide as it just is safe for any culture.I couldn't believe the bad guy in this movie to be so obvious straight from the beginning. How could that be so easy and the rest of the plot line is totally clear. The movie's entirely linear and dumb and actually offers very little. After everything's very clear we get typical fights, chases, tunnels and rats. And wait a minute.. snuff video tapes and lots of screaming. Does that really make the movie enough silly to become a cult classic. Nope. Not even close. The movie itself is technically well done with a decent budget but if they have this little imagination then no budget is good enough to make a good movie.",Vacancy
141,moimoichan6,What a beautiful opening credit (but the film that fallowed was one of the stupidest ever).,3,22 August 2007,"The names slowly appear in gigantic red and black colors, ""Sin City""'s style, before disappearing in a camera rotation that makes another name appears from several letters already present. All the names, in a continuing and fluid camera movement, finish to form a giant labyrinth. Style, elegance, atmosphere, coherence, the intriguing opening and ending credits are everything the film isn't. I have to get some information on the studio that did it. In between, you have a crappy horror movie, without any credibility or realism, that only have the advantage to last less than 80 minutes. It's like all the participants to this movie have lost their talents and abilities inside the labyrinth of the credit in the making of Vacancy.The beginning is quite intriguing, thought. A couple in crisis (they lost their child) are lost in a distant Californian road and have to spend their night in a sordid motel when their car stopped moving. But what they don't know is that the manager of the motel is a copycat of Norman Bates and that he enjoys making little snuff movies with some of his friends dressed like Michael Myers (but they're far from having his strength and personality).This is not a pleasant little horror movie as described in too many other comments : it's a sad and boring tentative to make us believe than those two could survive more than 20 minutes in order to make a long feature movie ! For that, the killers have to be beyond stupidity, and their incompetence slowly contaminates the movie, that becomes dumb and dumber until a grotesque ending that you don't even see in family Z-movies made for TV anymore. Beside a good photography and convincing actors, everything is sorrow in this movie, and especially its nonsense script. You'll better watch ""Psycho"", ""Halloween"" or even 8MM (him, on second thoughts, maybe not that one) again rather than this one. If only, there had been no vacancy in the theater for this movie that day...",Vacancy
142,walken_on_sunshine,My Theatre Had No Vacancy,9,20 April 2007,"The theater was packed more so than usual and why not as Vacancy was a very entertaining thrillride.Kate Beckinsale is great in her first Horror film and Luke Wilson is great in pretty much his first serious role as these two squabbling spouses can feed off of each others talent.Remember when we had nothing but slasher movies being intentionally funny, you know the days where Jason X, Wrong Turn, Scream, Freddy vs Jason, and I Know What You Did Last Summer well that is slowly coming to an end as Vacancy aligns itself with Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hills Have Eyes as a great serious slasher that doesn't have ridiculous humour or one liners.Vacancy has a simple enough storyline that has indeed been done before but the best thing about it is that unlike so many other slasher movies this one has a lot of character development as these characters aren't the typical teenager or cop whose name you don't remember or care about you know damn well who the Fox couple is, why they're having problems, and you end up rooting for them to survive.To say Vacancy is scary is a bit of a stretch but to say Vacancy is a great thriller would be about accurate.The storyline progresses at a fast pace but none of it is half @$$ed or out of nowhere everything makes sense in the end.Vacanc's pacing gets you're adrenaline pumping in the same way that any good quality thriller does.Vacancy has has a much more realistic and believable story as you know full well these killers are everyday people they aren't a monstrous man with a flesh disease like in Texas Chainsaw or House Of Wax and it's not some campy undead serial killer like Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.I think what added to the effect of the creepy atmosphere was having pretty much the whole film take place at night as it really gave you a cold feeling that something was lurking out their.Again my only complaints are that the dialogue is sometimes not well delivered, the plot is at times over the top, and it borrows a lot of elements from Psycho and Saw.The Good -Overall good acting -Doesn't rely solely on gore or jump scares -Good amount of character development -Excellent pace that keeps the adrenaline pumpingThe Bad -Some bad line delivery -Plot tends to get a little over the top -Various horror clichés eg. the car breaks down",Vacancy

But compelling performances, a disturbing twisted plot and exceptional direction make this so much more.

145,ChiefGoreMongral,Chief Goremongral's Movie Review: Vacancy,5,1 May 2007,"You know your having a bad day when you take a ""short cut"" only to have your car break down. Your having an utter nightmare when you check into a hotel only to find out that it is ran by directors of some Snuff films and you are their next big star. That is pretty much the premise for Vacancy a modest Horror/Thriller starring Kate Beckinsale and surprisingly funny man briefly turning serious actor Luke Wilson.What I can say about this film is fans of a more traditional thriller will like this more than the last movie I reviewed. ""Disturbia"" as it does not play to a younger audience and does not date itself with trite dialog and wacky teenage humor. The sad thing is this could have been a very solid film however thanks to some missed opportunities and a very ho-hum ending this plays out like a by the numbers middle of the road thriller.Don't get me wrong it has its moments but nothing we haven't seen already done before and in other cases better. I cannot recommend a full price admission to this one, only a matinée or even a rental. Again its not a bad movie just nothing that you will be singing its praises over several years from now.With a modest story and enough going on to keep you interested I give Vacancy the standard: 5/10-Average. With a more original ending and some additional back story on the killers this would have been an above average Thriller, however as is this is an average Thriller that will entertain fans to a point but you will more than likely feel like something is missing here.",Vacancy
146,aeo,Unexpectly good horror movie. Go see it.,7,5 May 2007,"I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars.First of all, I am sick of seeing the Wilson brothers, both Luke and Owen. As for Kate Beckinsale, the only movie she did great was in Underworld. With this kind of mindset, I had no desire to go and see this movie but my friends pestered me to go so I went. I am very glad that I did.Ever since Saw, movies have been trying to outdo each other in terms of gore and more over the top scenarios of people killing each other. After, Hostel, I had pretty much given up on a good horror movie that had thriller aspect without much gore. This is not to say that I don't like gore in my movies but movies like Saw was coming out in such succession that I missed those thriller/horror movies where over the top gore was not their sole mission.The formula for this movie was so simple and clichéd that you would think this movie would suck but the movie was done in a way that they were able to pull this movie off in an entertaining fashion. This movie is a great example of how a movie can use a common story line but do it still in a refreshing and entertaining way.In this movie, you have a couple driving at night on a deserted road far away from any town. They come upon a motel with a gas station that seemed like no one has patronized in a long time. In the motel is a creepy man who shows them to a room that seems like it has not changed since the 1960's. The husband puts a videotape into the VCR and sees what seems like someone getting killed but it is taking place in their room. From there, the fun begins.The movie was so good and scary that I was gripping my seat. I looked around the movie theater to see if others had the same reaction and the feelings seems mutual throughout the whole theater. I give kudos to the director and to the two stars, Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale. They did a good job. I also loved the performance of the motel manager. I remember him in many films during the 1980's, but usually in some comedic role.Overall a good horror movie. I highly recommend it.",Vacancy
147,DVR_Brale,Keeps it simple and does what is supposed to do,6,21 June 2017,"A troubling couple find themselves in a motel whose owner likes to make his guests stars of his snuff movies. They have to find a way out. Nothing we haven't heard of before. But Vacancy is enjoyable because of two things.First, it puts more emphasis on claustrophobic bunker elements.Secondly, it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. This is a short horror flick made for quick entertainment without additional, more complex elements (as in The Babadook or It Follows) which would undoubtedly make it from time to time boring.There are quite a few jump-scares without much of a gore. As in most movies of this type, characters are prone to making irrational decisions but Beckinsale and Wilson make up for it since two of them look nice together.In short, if you're looking for a not too scary movie without macabre or gore for short entertainment, you've come to the right place. Oh, and there's a third thing: it's got a little bit of soul in it as well.",Vacancy
148,Cinema_Love,"Highly recommended, very entertaining!!",8,22 April 2007,"I had the choice between this one and the last one starring Anthony Hopkins and I really prefer this one. Finally, Luke Wilson in a serious role and guess what, he's excellent. Him and Kate Beckinsale make a good couple on-screen. They have chemistry and it helps all the 85 minutes of this movie. The movie focuses on the thriller-note with lots of suspense and false indications. You can be sure that you won't feel rob after paying money for a movie like that. It's like watching a Hitchcock movie but on our decade. I saw some people comparing this to Saw, maybe because it's not another fast-food movie with lots of cliché, so on that side, I 100% agree, probably one of the best thrillers in recent years!! It's excellent, highly recommended!!",Vacancy
149,crickwill,Pretty Vacant...,5,24 July 2020,"Everything about this makes you feel like it was made in a hurry, the lean 82 minute running time and the whole enterprise in general. The plot feels generic but the cast rides along with it as best they can.The motel proprietor and the loveable inept cop are pure caricatures and the masked sidekicks are just anonymous constructs. The couple concerned flail around and don't take adequate measures to arm themselves from their dire predicament which at times actually leaves one more in commerce with the baddies, not a healthy station for the viewer, in which we are supposed to be engaged for their survival. A few plot contrivances later and they indeed appear to have overcome their ordeal. Its all very adequate and passable but its nowhere in the terrain of a being a thrill ride and more than likely you'll forget having watched it by the following morning. Watch Psycho again and marvel at the machinations on display instead.",Vacancy

This picture is technically correct in almost every facet of film making. There were several plot holes that took away several stars and there were moments that this movie really could've taken off into something terrifying, but fell a little short. BUT! Overall, definitely worth seeing! There are good scares and like I said, a very acceptable production level standard.

This is one of my most favorite horror movies to watch. To escape from the motel rooms seem to be futile, but it can be done if a hidden compartment in the ceiling or side can be located. Beckinsale and Wilson were totally believable as a couple that was frightened out of their wits....and scared for their lives. No twisted and convoluted plot, just a straight forward go for the kill. If you have a strong heart, grab your popcorn, turn the lights down, lock the doors. Great movie.",Vacancy
152,powerfull_jedi,A real roach motel,8,26 September 2007,"I just came back from a screening of this movie and I have to admit it was pretty sweet. Snuff films, in a realistic context, make absolutely no sense(why does a criminal bother to videotape the murder he committed and share the bootlegs with paying costumers?) but that doesn't that Hollywood from dwelling into this curious urban legend. Take Vacancy for instance, a couple(Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) who roam around lost end up at a shady looking motel after their car breaks down, they often fight with each other over their deceased son and their upcoming divorce(not that this adds much to the plot or anything), but anyway, they check into a room and they start hearing all kinds of creepy noises and they alert the manager, while resting, David starts watching some tapes of what, at first seems to be a cheesy horror movie, the laughing stops when they figure it's the exact same room they're in as the movie shows. They are in a roach motel, customers check in, but they don't check out, they up taking part in murder porn, so they have to find a way to escape. I'll be honest, the movie's not that scary(the premise is scary, though)but it excels in one main area: tension. The movie makes you feel uneasy from the moment things start to get a little odd. It also helps that Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale play their role so well, even though for Luke Wilson this is sorta new, those Wilson-esquire mannerisms and accents that are common in both Owen Wilson(get well) and Luke Wilson's movies is very unnoticeable. The only flaw is that even for a short movie, it feels like it takes forever to get to the good stuff, but nevertheless, it's doesn't disappoint. Definitely worth checking out at the movies.",Vacancy
153,villard,Vacant of Terror,3,25 August 2007,"This film is a K-Mart blue light special on Alfred Hitchcock wannabes.""Vacuous"" is a more suiting title than ""Vacancy."" I think better casting over-all might have given this film more energy and tension and raised the viewer anxiety level. (The only exception is Frank Whaley who is very convincing as a sociopath).Luke Wilson is so blabbering, low-key and whiny, and Kate Beckinsale so sour-pussed and bitchy, that you're routing for the Halloween made-up boogie men to finish them off halfway through the film.For example, the boringly dour couple spend and endless amount of time trying to break out the bathroom window. I would have given anything for ""The Shining's"" Jack Nicholson to axe through the front door screaming ""Heeer's Johnny!!"" Alas, no such hair-raising excitement.The cat-and-mouse chase around the motel is just as flaccid. Only the stumbling brainless ghouls from the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" are more ineffectual. The oversize gopher tunnel network had potential for horror, but simply doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat. They could have stuffed it with a rotting corpse or two from the ""Indiana Jones"" prop dept. This would have at least ratcheted up the terror.Equally lethargic is Luke Wilson taking at interminable amount of time to figure out that the VHS snuff videos he's viewing were filmed in their shabby motel room. Doh!!(This dragging out of the obvious easily surpasses the previous award winner: Prof. Van Helsing's slow realization that vampire Bela Lugosi doesn't have a mirror reflection, in the 1931 ""Dracula."")Overall, the movie has enough goofy plot holes to sink the Titanic. Finally, in this age of Interstate roads and bypasses, it's really hard to imagine a couple getting so far off the beaten path -- in California no less -- where a motel sits on a completely desolate road. It's not this vacant on long-gone Route 66. The setup is as silly as the Blair Witch Project student filmmakers getting lost for days in Maryland woods.",Vacancy

To my amazement they were actually good together. They display a lot of heart and cunning trying to endure the nightmare they've walked into. The bad guys are patient yet bold and bide their time tormenting and taunting the new occupants pushing them to turn on each other before they move in for the kill. Very tense and fun horror, nothing really cheesy at all. I never looked away or got remotely bored and thought this was a well thought out film with a very committed cast and crew. Well done!",Vacancy
155,dean2900,Overrated and derivative,4,1 June 2007,"I was very surprised to see this horror flick have a 6.9 rating on IMDb with thousands of votes. There were many reviews saying this movie builds suspense.However, this movie is so derivative of countless horror flicks that there is absolutely nothing exciting or interesting that happens.Possible MINOR SPOILERS: The movie is real easy to summarize. A bickering couple decide to take a short cut and have their car break down in the middle of nowhere. They stop at a sleazy hotel which has no TV reception but has a VCR with movies showing people being killed in the exact hotel room they are in. They panic and try to escape the bad guys who want to create a snuff film with them as the stars.You can pretty much guess how the movie ends. There is nothing original or the slightest bit scary.The only reason I give it four stars is because the beginning dialogue was believable and the movie doesn't try to go over the top with gore. The director obviously tried to create tension but failed for anyone who has seen more than a couple horror flicks.You could certainly pick out a worse film in this clichéd genre but I would recommend renting the original Psycho instead.Dean",Vacancy
156,silentcheesedude,"Yeah, Vacant of a good movie",2,21 October 2007,"I rented this movie with a free coupon, but I think Bloodbuster, the Hal Lieberman Company, Sony, the actors, and everyone involved in this trash should personally come to my house and pay me $100 dollars each,(it'll go to charity) PLUS, I get to lock them in my bathroom with the lights off and I pound on the door for 85 minutes. Because that's what this movie was. 85 minutes of pounding on something, like a door or a window. 85 minutes that I will never get back.It looked so promising: Two couples breakdown and have to walk to a hotel. Soon they are harassed by idiots who knock on the walls and doors. They find that they are going to be part of a snuff film, in which the victims will be killed, and it will be filmed by hidden cameras. Only the cameras are not so hidden. Any fool could have found them. And the bad guys left the movies next to the VCR. And oh... what's this? A trap door that leads to a tunnel, right to the bad guy's office? (not a spoiler, since the back of the DVD cover mentions it) If the bad guys were so intelligent to make a tunnel, and lure unsuspecting couples to a hotel room just to kill them, why would they make everything accessible for them to just simply get away?There are a number of stupid script holes. The bad guys are never fleshed out. It's repetitive, and it takes too long to get nowhere. The end of the movie shows no surprise, sense, or reason. Not even a little epilogue. You are never rewarded and sorry, no nudity. Too bad, Kate is hot. You are, however, left thinking how easy it is for good marketing and advertisement to steal your money.The best thing I could say about this movie is that it was short. At just under an hour and a half, I felt that if the movie had gone on any longer, my eyes would start to bleed, my brain would pop out and me, all my unborn children, and my children's children would be rendered stupid until we all died.",Vacancy
157,LeroyBrown-2,Surprisingly good.,7,13 January 2009,"I have to admit I was never a fan of these kinds of movies. The innocent people who become the victims of murderous sociopaths. I find these movies to be rather sadistic, not just what they show on the screen but how they treat their audience. They make us watch the victims suffer and rarely have any surprise or suspense, plus everything is telegraphed to the audience. I have to admit that the reason I watched this movie was because it was late at night and there was nothing else to watch. And I also have to admit I was ready to hate it but I was pleasantly surprised.What really surprised me was the quality of acting. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are fine actors but they have not chosen great materials in the past. A movie like ""Vacancy"" is the kind of movie you immediately associate as a movie where the actors showed up for a paycheck. Maybe they did but they earned it. They were both convincing playing their parts, they didn't phone it in. They created real characters that you can care about.The movie was also well directed. Credit has to go to the director, Nimrod Antal. He did a great job, instead on focusing on the characters being tortured he focus on them fighting for their survival and and planning to escape. Too often in many of these movies we see the characters being tortured and the actors being humiliated. I pity and respect actors who end up in movies like these and are subjected to all kind of humiliation. They're spat on, forced to disrobe, fondled, force to lick somebody's boots and so on and so on. I wonder if at those moments if they start thinking, ""You know, maybe taking that managerial trainee position at Walgreens isn't so bad."" But still many of those actors remain professional and do their jobs well. This movie limit the torture and humiliation scenes to the absolute minimum.The screenplay also makes the characters do things that are smarter than in a regular horror movie. They're not just screaming mimies who are running around like chickens withe their heads cut off. They're smart people who are trying to figure out how they will survive this situation. Another smart thing this movie did was that it was just a couple of people trying to survive not a van load of people. Otherwise it becomes the kind of movie where the audience end up playing who gets it next. Multiple slasher movies stayed with that formula and it became tedious a long time ago.My one major complaint involves the gun over the doorway, I wouldn't say anything more except logically that part didn't make sense.

Vacancy stands out for me as an in-depth analysis from the victims perspective.I was able to identify very well with Luke Wilson's character David in terms of rational thinking, decision making and personality. Made me feel more involved when things went from bad to worse, the foxy Kate Beckinsale was great too. Having only seen her in the Underworld series; diversity was definitely shown in terms of acting ability.From the opening credits right to the last shot i was sitting in awe, not necessarily because of a clever script but simply great storytelling. As for my personal opinion about the existence of snuff? I'm 100% sure that it exists, if not for profit at least for private amusement. Good casting choices, Norman Bates should've considered this method of murder haha. But seriously, great film - i think i'll add this one to my collection.",Vacancy
160,c_p_c,Vacancy just doesn't capture what it could have.,5,24 April 2007,"Supposedly their actual existence is debatable, but snuff films could be reduced to urban legend status. Still, this world has some dark corners, so I wouldn't put it out of mind completely. Nevertheless, the idea of people getting pleasure from filming live murders and torture is frightening. However, as much as it could be, 'Vacancy' is not.The idea for this film is not fully realized and instead it's reduced to a cat and mouse chase that becomes all to predictable. Beyond the initial viewing of the snuff tapes (left intentionally in the room by the manager), which is probably the film's most intense scene, the couple runs from room to room as they attempt to get away, which the film makes too easy for them at times.The real issue lies with the lack of details in the workings of the villains and motel. It appears we have three men who do nothing more than check people into a room and kill them soon after. They do very little to toy with their minds. No mystery about the villains exists. The hotel manager is the only one afforded any time for development and it is all far too superficial. What is needed is some more for the villains to do. I doubt that after doing this for as long as they have, their methods would be as primitive and mundane as displayed here.The always beautiful Beckinsale and seemingly aloof Wilson, who manages to sidestep his usual goof-ball role, do what they can with what they are given. Aside from an opening scene where they lay out the status of their marriage, they are given very little time for further development--outside of the typical ""I love you now that we have been through something awful."" All in all, a very mediocre film that could have been so much more with a reworking. Also, if you do see this film, see if you can spot the moment when the script writers had no other ideas on where to go next. It's obvious.",Vacancy

So far so good.**SPOILER ALERT** What completely ruins this film is the appallingly lame ending.I was really expecting an evil twist to precedings but all you get is our heroine managing to dispatch with all the villains, call for the Police, and find that her husband wasn't actually killed when stabbed by one of the gang!I can't remember when I was so annoyed at a films finale, utterly lame, and one of the most disappointing movies of the year.",Vacancy
162,bastiaan0740,enjoyable,6,30 August 2009,"First off, I was glad to finally see another Hollywood movie with no CGI whatsoever. Although none was needed, it seems that movie makers seem to throw it in just for the hell of it lately (Hostel 2 ending?), getting that 2% extra niceness for ruining all the visual realism and confronting the audience with the fact they're watching a movie. It's like having a cameraman in the shot.I enjoyed the movie. But that's not to say the movie doesn't have its flaws. I'll state my issues and the solutions as well.Issue nr 1: plot realism.out of the average 500 hotel goers (judging by the amount of tapes), 0% carries a lethal weapon, 0% can fight better than an average adult white male, 0% can outrun an average adult white male, 0% can remain undetectable in the dark.And not only that, the former green-beret (probably), 100-pound Amy Fox does all of the above, killing assailants with her car, outfighting a man armed with a revolver, outrunning her attackers from the hotel and blocking their path to her, misguiding them, and hiding on the rooftop.The absence of cell phone coverage is an obvious necessity in order to 'trap' and isolate the victims, but does it have satellite blocking for GPS anti-theft car systems, like the one in their BMW? 500 disappearances in an area with only one hotel? I understand adding more previous victims adds to the drama and terror, but it is overdone.Solution: 10 previous victims, max. , which adds more realism and plausibility.Issue nr 2: the 'comfort zone'During the movie, we get an increasing sense that something's wrong; on a comfort zone (10/10 feeling safe, 0/10 fearing for your life)1) nice people helping for free and giving free presents. 10/10. 2) car breaks down; worries; but a safe place to stay - although unfamiliar. 9/10. 3) Hotel clerk seems a bit odd. Horror screams in the background, but quickly dismissed as a movie. 8/10. 4) Hotel room could have been cleaner and seems oddly unaccommodating. 8/10. Dirty isn't scary. 5) Bah. More low-budget horror movies, also unaccommodating. 8/10. 6) Minute 24: START OF DISCOMFORT ZONE: Phones ring; door banging. This is wrong; someone's there! What do they want? 4/10. 4) Minute 32: - this is 8 MINUTES - END OF DISCOMFORT ZONE. Ah, I figured it out. Those are snuff tapes shot in this very room, and i can see the cameras; we're the next victims. Death terror! 0/10 until the end of the movie.The transition from discomfort to danger was too fast for my taste. I'll admit this is personal preference, and perhaps I was misled by the trailers and setup up until that point, but the movie would have been so much better if this stage of insecurity was prolonged somewhat. I would have loved to see more happen first, some strange shadows outside; some doubts about the autenthicity of the tapes; an inability to find camera's, leaving confusion; a mental debate over whether it's safer to stay or to leave; even split opinions with the wife being scared and the man rationalizing and wanting to stay.Solution: more confusion and insecurity before realizing the grim truth.Issue nr 3: the ending. It sucked.I have to agree with basically everyone else - David should have stayed dead at the end. If the movie makers did want to go with the happy-Hollywood end, where the victim gets to off her would-be killers, don't bring David back as well. The movie basically reached a perfect ending with Amy hiding and seeing her husband getting killed.

163,k-dhesi,Thrilling and suspenseful. But lacks in many other qualities.,6,23 May 2009,"Vacany. A nice suspenseful thriller. But that's pretty much it. A unique and great idea but it get's ruined. A little scrappy here and there, but still very decent and keeps you mildly entertained. Could of been so much better with more thought put into it.It does just about enough for a thriller, it gives you some nice thrills. It's fast and very direct. Start's to get very suspenseful at times, your curiosity start's to wonder too as soon as they reach the motel. But is that enough? Definitely not. Although it offers all that, it's lacking in major details. The cast listing was a good idea, two brilliant main actors. (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale.) Did good. A great combination them two and wonderful pair, they surely didn't disappoint. ""The killers"" were creepy and scary. Remind's you of a famous killer. ""Jason"" Enough good, let's discuss the things it lacks.The major thing standing out here here is the plot. That's were i was really disappointed. They just don't explain enough in the movie. You start thinking why is that happening, but it's no answer to follow up. They don't tell you why the two main characters are target's. It's just no storyline or history behind what's going on, you get the impression that the ""killers"" are just plain phycos. Basically when i was watching it, it got me thinking, it must be reason why all this is happening. But again they still don't explain. It made me feel the film is just really pointless. Until you watch the sequel then you will realise why it's happening. But the sequel was just recently released, and unfortunately not for the big screen, so the chances are you missed it. (however Vacany 2 was some how a step up from Vacany) The length of the movie was a bit too less, but that was nothing major.A great one for some nice fast thrills. Gives you shocks and keeps you occupied. But a rather disappointing one as a whole. Great idea, but executed not so well.",Vacancy

In terms of memorable characters, dialogue, set pieces, themes and messages, well, it's got none. Thankfully it does not pretend to be anything else than what it is. You come for a few scares, and that's what you'll get. Nimrod Antal managed to get the job directing Predators because of this film, so the guy knows how to craft a thriller, but this movie is a mcdonald's hamburger - as soon as you eat it it feels satisfying for a minute, then you regret eating it and go buy a steak afterwards.

They have a conflict because of a tragedy that happened and then their car sustain a problem, so their day isn't the perfect one.When they find a motel, weird things start to happen. Someone knocks hard the door repeatedly and motel's manager acts suspiciously. This scene was so creepy! I loved it! Especially when they realise that they are about to star in a snuff film and they watch over and over again the ""film"", so they can find mistakes... absolutely genius!I highly recommend this film, because it's very creepy and scary.

It was too obvious that the man at the desk was suspicious and in on the act. And when they were in the room the characters discovered too quickly what was going on and you don't really go on a journey with them to discover what is happening.Yes it is a bit tense but chunks are missed out and dismissed to quickly.

169,keiichi73,"Has its moments, but fails to leave a mark",6,20 April 2007,"If we learn anything about David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale), the heroes of Vacancy, it is that they have obviously never watched a horror movie in their lives. If they had, they would have known better than to check into the Pinewood Motel and we would be left without a movie. The obvious signs are numerous and ominous. There's the sound of a woman's blood-curdling screams coming from behind the front desk when they check in, there's the mousy and immediately suspicious man running the front desk (Frank Whaley) who makes Norman Bates look like a well-adjusted model employee, and there's the overall creepy vibe that the entire building itself gives off. It's not until they discover the gruesome snuff films in their motel room and the masked madmen start chasing them down that the two finally start fearing for their lives. All the audience can do by that point is sit back and silently say ""told you so"" to the characters.When we first meet the unlucky couple, they are a constantly feuding husband and wife who are taking an ill-advised road trip together as kind of a last memory of their relationship before the divorce papers become final. Tensions are high, and the fact that their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere does not exactly help matters. This leads them to the ""Motel from Hell"" where they ignore the previously mentioned signs of trouble, and check into a scuzzy room where roaches scurry about and mysterious stains cover the bed sheets. They quickly catch on that there's much more to worry about when David discovers some videotapes of what appears to be former guests in the same room they're staying in being brutally beaten and murdered by masked men. Discovering that they are being videotaped at all times by numerous hidden cameras in the room, the couple try to escape, but find the outside area of the motel being patrolled by those mysterious men on the video who refuse to let them leave. It turns out this entire building is a trap set by some very deranged individuals who murder any guest unfortunate enough to check in, and videotape the results for their own twisted amusement.With a running time that barely manages to hit 80 minutes, Vacancy is tightly edited and tightly paced. Not a second is wasted as the movie dives head-first into its genuinely creepy premise. There are a number of scenes that are bound the raise the tension of all but the most jaded of horror buffs. The brief glimpses that we see of the crudely made murder videos are terrifying without being exploitive, as the movie is wise not to linger too long on the images. The tension is built up even more when creepy and mysterious stuff starts happening. There's a very loud banging on the door of the motel room, and even on the walls from the room next door. The power starts flickering on and off at random, and it's obvious that someone or something is messing with them. It's when the mysterious men start popping up and chasing our heroes that the movie stops being frightening and intriguing, and simply turns into a generic slasher film. (Albeit a slasher film with better production and acting values than the norm.) The men lurk about in the dark just outside the motel room, pop up in front of windows suddenly, and really don't do a whole heck of a lot. It's a bit of a let down after such a generally creepy set up.Filmmaker Nimrod Antal has a strong look and an obvious eye for creeping out his audience, but he seems to run out of ideas once his characters start running away. That doesn't mean he doesn't do what he can with the material. He makes the most of his limited setting, managing to find ways to avoid making the movie come across as being repetitive. He stages some sequences in a large variety of places around the motel, as well as a complex series of tunnels underneath the building that the villains use to get around. He is further aided by a game cast that help lift the material up a little bit from the B-grade junk it obviously is. Mainly known for his comedic work, Luke Wilson makes for a pretty decent everyman in the male lead. He seems genuinely unnerved as the realization of just how bad the situation is slowly dawns on him. As his wife, Kate Beckinsale is given slightly less to do until the final 10 minutes or so when she is forced to take control and fight for both of their survival. Until then, she mostly switches back and forth from being bitchy and irritable to being weepy and fearful. As the head of the whole shady motel operation, Frank Whaley is appropriately slimy, but much like the other villains, he is given very little to do once his role in the plot is revealed.Vacancy has no notions of being anything but what it is - a somewhat enjoyable little piece of horror escapism that hits some good notes, but is far too slight and forgettable to leave much of an impression. It's not bad, but it is disappointing after a fairly strong opening half hour that hints at much more. The movie is brisk and well-made, at the very least. Still, I can't get over the notion that perhaps the film does it's job a bit too well at setting up an ominous atmosphere at the motel. I don't think anyone would be able to set foot there without expecting murderous masked madmen lurking about somewhere nearby. If you're trying to lure people into a death trap, I would suggest maybe using a somewhat more cheerful facade. Might attract more business. Couldn't hurt is all I'm saying.",Vacancy

This movie is just plain scary with many jump scenes. The acting is great especially by Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson. It's nice to see Wilson in something other than a comedy. Despite it's running time of less than an hour and a half, this movie is as long as it needs to be. Everything is explained by the end. This is a slasher movie that goes back to it's roots and not some movie about mindless torture which it seems the direction of slasher movies are headed and I applaud Nimród Antal(who also did Predators which was a great action/scifi movie) for not going in that direction.

Two, the great performance by Frank Whaley. Beside this, everything else in the movie is not worth the time.The story is not that bad, but it could have been executed differently to make it a truly horrifying movie... I suppose it is an OK movie for those who like commercial movies or the typical Hollywood Horror, but not for the real Horror buff out there.The dialogue between Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson is absurd... too simple and Wilson's performance is very weak. The killings are simple and leave much to the imagination. The movie itself is predictable and the ending is the WORST there can be...I did not like that the opening and ending credits had a score that somewhat resemble the music from Psycho... as if somehow this was similar to the late 60s masterpiece.

Wilson is good, but it is nice to see a lead female in a horror film.What makes this different, is the sheer lack of horror elements, no nudity, no gore, just genuine scares with genuine suspense.Overall, it's a must watch for any horror fan; just don't watch it alone.",Vacancy

Kate Beckinsale is really good but I was not hugely impressed by Luke Wilson's portrayal. I thought he was trying too hard. This is basically a home invasion movie with a new coat of paint.

Then more banging on a door. Then, if that was not scary enough, more banging on a door.Then there are other time constraints and number problems that leave you guessing.

There are times, as in many horror movies, that you feel like yelling at the protagonists, but they're not nearly as acute as in many lower-echelon horrors.The one thing I didn't like was the upbeat intro and outro - musically, and thematically, I felt it took away from the overarching tonality of claustrophobia and danger.Also, you will have to suspend disbelief where the premise is concerned.

181,canadasbest,"Entertaining, but not spectacular",6,20 April 2007,"Vacancy is very much a mixed bag as far as horror films go. On the plus side, it doesn't resort to using teenage actors which makes a big different. The atmosphere is excellent and the pacing is top notch. There's never too much going on, but never a lag either. The film does transition well from suspense to calm to suspense again in just the way every thriller does.Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale also turn in solid performances, Wilson's in particular was pretty good. He played a perfect ""scared guy"" believable and not over the top.On the negative side, the movie does use a ton of already massively overused horror movie clichés (middle of nowhere, car breaks down, characters find run down gas station/motel/store with creepy manager, etc.) . Now to the filmmakers' credit, some are done quite well, but that doesn't excuse the fact that most are tired and overdone as it is.There also seem to be a few problems with the plot that weaken the film somewhat. Firstly, in the snuff videos that we see characters view, there is clearly sound, suggesting the cameras in the rooms can pick up audio. Despite this, the bad guys never seem to overhear all the plans the main characters make while trapped in their room.Secondly, why are there no traps in the underground ducts liked barbed wire or rusty nails or something that would impede the progress of anyone trying to get through? I find it hard to believe that our two heroes were the first people to ever find and use them.Thirdly, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it seems odd that despite all the murders that have been committed, the bad guys are still allowed to do their thing, you'd think someone would have investigated and busted them, especially with tapes and tapes of evidence sitting around.And finally the ending just didn't seem to work. They went with an open ending approach, where there's no real wrap up and the audience is left to figure out how the story ends on their own. This type of thing can work effectively if used well, but it just falls flat here and seems to sudden. Instead of thinking ""ohhh, I wonder how it turns out?"" the audience instead thinks ""what happened to the rest of the movie?"".The sad part is that the movie came so close to being a really clever suspense flick. Imagine if Luke Wilson's character had deliberately taken the ""shortcut"" to lure his soon to be ex-wife (whom he is already upset with) to the Pinewood and was in on it all along? That would be a great ending, but sadly this film suffers a decided lack of plot twists.Probably not worth checking out in the theatre, but will make a great rental in a few months time.",Vacancy

I only knew Frank Whalhey from Hoffa and Pulp Fiction that he took small roles on. But I have to say that he did very good with his role and I believe that he, Luke, and Kate deserve every award for there acting in this film (except the razzie!!!). Even though it was short, it still made almost jump out of my seat. I have seen Disturbia, but the major difference is that film has a little more comedy/romance rather than suspense but it is a very good. But this film on the other end, has all the suspense that you have been waiting for. The storyline was great except the ending like every other suspense films, they (Luke and Kate) live. I mean Luke was stab at nighttime for god sakes and the story ends in the morning, it just would have been a better movie if Luke would of died in the film (MAJOR SPOILER RIGHT THERE!!!).

No device is overused. The whole scene in the tunnels is perfectly photographed, executed and directed and it's easy as heck to turn off an audience in a chase scene like that really quickly.

Like its predecessors, it's a good flick, opting for a non-stop, relentless pace that keeps you pretty much glued to the screen.It's built on its own fairly unique premise, and little is offered about what motivates the killer(s), but then again it's all pretty self-explanatory so it's actually kind of nice that they didn't waste any time with dying confessions.

190,andydreamseeker,Movie Review: Vacancy,6,25 July 2007,"I think it bogs down to your level of threshold for ""thrill"", ""scare"" and ""experience"" for this one. Vacancy, the film starring Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson is very much textbook stuff when we talk about the genre of horror and thriller.Although nothing really new, the idea remains interesting. David (Luke Wilson) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale) are driving home one night when the car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.Almost conveniently there is a gas station and motel nearby where help can be found. It'll be futile to think the two of them are going elsewhere. That is not going to happen. They will stay at the motel and they will be trapped. If not then where is the story?So then the two quarrelsome duos will discover in their creepy ""Honeymoon Suite"" that a collection of videos featuring gruesome images of violent murder are filmed exactly where they are. Imagine yourself in their shoes. I bet you'll be freaked out too.The thrill in Vacancy is how David and Amy tries their best to outsmart their captors who are watching from every possible hidden camera if to escape the fate of those seen in the videos.The scare in Vacancy is how director Nimród Antal uses the textbook stuff of leaving spaces in between scenes for your imagination to enter.Literally that is what the word ""Vacancy"" means, a vacant spot for you to fill in. It is also no wonder that the three psychos, led by motel manager Mason (Frank Whaley) are obsessed about their game. This out of place motel in the middle of nowhere is awfully lonely.The scene where the mechanic played by Ethan Embry saying to the couple, ""I should pay you for giving me something to do,"" tells it best. The idle mind really is the devil's workshop.Vacancy the movie however cannot be described as believable. Again here is one those films that can be enjoyable only if we take logic away from it. As I've mentioned earlier, how much this movie works is largely dependant on your threshold for ""thrill"", ""scare"" and ""experience"". To me Vacancy is not very scary or thrilling. Due to it being unbelievable, and based on my experience with the thriller and horror genre, the plot is pretty much laid out for me. I knew what was going to happen, but it did not stop me from having fun watching the film.Ever wondered why some people could laugh at the sight of horror on screen? I found the answer in Vacancy. It being unreal and sometimes silly is laughable. I wanted to question its authenticity but gave up because it is not documentary or comparable to the Saw or Hostel franchise. There's nothing gruesome in Vacancy, just a simple game of cat and mouse played within an isolated vicinity of a creepy motel. It is at the very least an entertaining getaway into the darkroom with a big screen.Those with a higher threshold might beg to differ but I sure had fun watching Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale playing the victims.Vacancy is not the best of its kind but definitely not the worst. Have you got time to kill? Why not fill your vacancy with Vacancy?",Vacancy
191,alan_v35,No restful night's sleep at this motel,6,13 September 2007,"Vacancy is the first English language project for director Nimrod Antal who caught Hollywood's eye with the 2003 Hungarian language, subway project, Kontrol (or Control in the US) With Vacancy, Antal has created a pretty good small-scale thriller with decent performances, good action and well-done edge-of-your-seat suspense. The story is simple and fairly believable for the suspense genre, which usually bends credibility to the breaking point. Luc Wilson, who usually does comedy, shows that he can handle a change of pace here. Beckinsale's character has less to do, perhaps, but her performance seems flat in comparison.A married couple on the verge of divorce after the loss of a child, is traveling off the interstate when car trouble lands them at an out-of-the-way motel, where manager, Mason, played by Frank Whaley hooks them up with the honeymoon suite at no extra cost, but they get anything but a restful night's sleep here.Vacancy is a decent suspense genre formula film that could have used better-developed villains and more innovation. The end result is a generic thriller with little to differentiate itself from the scores of others to choose from. It's not a bad movie and suspense fans might like it, but with Fracture on the New Release shelf, I would go for that one first.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com",Vacancy
192,terrors89,A few cliché's but good Intensity,7,27 April 2007,"When it comes to intensity, there hasn't been a movie release in 2007 that has matched that of this movie. It reminds of the 2005 movie A History of Violence because it immediately grabs you and holds on to the end of the movie. Vacancy also reminds me of that movie because like Violence, Vacancy really doesn't have an ending that calms the viewer down either. It's not bad, but between that problem and a few cliché's, Vacancy is watch able but not outstanding.David and Amy Fox, played by Luke Wilson (My Super Ex-Girlfriend) and Kate Beckinsale (click) respectively, are a married couple who are traveling back from the wife's parent's house when the car that they are driving breaks down on the side of the road at night. They check into a run down motel managed by Mason, played by Frank Whaley (World Trade Center) and try to wait it out until daybreak comes. As the Fox's are in the room they discover video tapes of snuff films and discover that their room is where all of the violence has taken place and after finding the video camera's they realize that they have to try and survive the night or become the next victims of a new snuff film.It is easier for me to talk about the cliché's first. The first one is that the couple are fighting and will be getting a divorce and apparently it is due to the death of their child and one blame's oneself and the other just wants to move on. Another cliché is the whole scene with the borderline old inept cop that you know will die the minute the hood to the engine of the squad car comes down. There are more of your basic scare technique cliché's but these examples will do for now. They didn't hurt the film to bad but other parts of the film were better than these scenes and they should have thought of something better.Like I said the intensity was outstanding during the length of the movie. Almost from the beginning I got nervous and found myself holding onto the arm rests of the chair quite vigorously. Director Nimrod Antal did a great job of setting the mood for the story not by offering cheap scares in the beginning but by having the couple argue in the car at the beginning of the movie. It created an uneasy feeling watching how awkward the couple were while in the car. Once in the hotel room the pressure that the Fox's were under in the film translated very well to me as I was sitting in the audience. Even the opening credits were so disorganized or had the appearance of it that it was just unsettling from beginning to end and was very stressful.Which brings me to the other part of the film that bothered me which reminds me of the other film, after almost two hours of stress and wondering how they are going to get out of it, it all ends in a matter of five minutes. It wasn't a quick silly ending, but it was very intense and you didn't know if the bad guys were truly dead and the ending music was just as unnerving as the opening credits music. So you get to the final scene and then, bang, it's over. For me, I would like to have so kind of stimulation letting me know that the film is over. Either the pictures on the screen or the music should tell me that. But it didn't, so as I was getting ready for the next scene to tell me what happens, it rolls credits. Those kind of ending's bother me and for me, it takes away from the movie.If you like suspenseful, stressful movies, then Vacancy is the one to go see. Of the three horror, suspense movies I have seen this year, this one is by far the best. Considering the competition that sounds like I am not saying much, but it is a very descent movie and worth a peek at the cinema before the summer begins.",Vacancy

196,little_rhody,Great premise - lousy rendering,4,24 June 2007,"I didn't find Vacancy to be all the suspenseful. When I think of hotels and suspense, I think of Psycho (the original - not the remake). Vacancy doesn't measure up. Although there are fine performances by Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, and there is adequate explanation of the plot points, something didn't click for me.I like the idea of businesses doing anything to survive after traffic is rerouted away from them. In this case it's producing snuff films. I also like the idea of guests viewing the films made in their room to show them what's in store. But the suspense is lost once the ""terror"" starts because it comes on too strong too fast. Subtlety sustained for a longer stretch of the film might have improved it.",Vacancy
197,boothstr96,Pervasive (no joke) suspense with a crappy ending.,8,23 April 2007,"For the first ten minutes, Wilson and Beckinsale simply drive and talk, but it is well worth the wait once they get to the motel because the action starts right away. The suspense was literally throughout the whoel movie. Every second there was a new obstacle to face which left the audience (not on the edge of their seat) but falling off because there was so much suspense. It reminded me a lot of Psycho without the hag and SAW/Hostel when you watched the brutal snuff films they make which can be really disturbing i warn you. While watching the film you find yourself rooting for Wilson and Beckinsale because it is so realistic you actually want them to escape. Usually in horror films you kinda (lets be honest) want the main character to die lol. But in this one, the realism makes you hate the villains and root the heroes. The ending i might as well give away so turn away now if you don't want to hear it, it's nothing big at all, in fact it sucks. Luke Wilson gets stabbed and lays there for about two hours without moving, constantly losing blood and Kate Beckinsale kills the other guys and comes back to Wilson and he's alive. Shocker. Reminded me of the end of Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Beginning. And then they call the cops and the scene fades to the credits. The movie was so good i am disappointed they had to end it that way. Nevertheless it delivers a good scare.",Vacancy
198,The_Jihadi,"Trust Me, You Don't Wanna Watch This!",3,9 January 2008,"This film was released in Indian Cinema halls here in India. One of my friends suggested me this film and i went to watch this piece of Garbage. The film starts with a good premise and ends up going nowhere.David Fox (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale) are couples who gets trapped in this motel where the owner has fixed a camera in every room. He kills people and makes Sadistic Films out of it and sells. The start of the film is very promising. But later when the film proceeds, You start to imagine what will happen in the next minutes. I am sorry but i will not call this a Thriller. A thriller is supposed to give you Joilts. And this one doesn't. I will also not agree with the other commenter's on this board. I think the other commenter's here hasn't seen much of Thrillers. This is a typical straight B Grade slasher that neither entertains nor gives any Shock Value. It still doesn't matter if it's a B Grade Slasher (Which this film tries to be) but there should be some kind of Excitement in it?? I have seen some very good Independent B Grade Slashers... I wish i had not seen this film.I wonder how actors such as Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale agreed to work in such kinds of films. There are so many other Thrillers that can be watched but not this one. The Film Maker Nimrod Antal could've easily made this film more gripping. But given a Bad Script, What can a Film Maker do?

199,Charles_Carmichael,Vacancy - Only In The Script,3,16 June 2007,"A great idea for a movie, ruined by a poor script. The story of a couple who end up at a remote motel after their car ends up over heating. The couple played by Luke Wilson, better known for his comedy performances as cute but lovable, and Kate Beckinsale are woefully cast as a bickering couple on the verge of divorce.The film lacked any tension or suspense with all moments designed to bring of this to the film being telegraphed so badly the audience is yawning waiting for it to happened.The sub-plot, which is the bickering aspect between David (Wilson) and Amy (Beckinsale) is drawn out with trickles of information throughout the film, yet still fail to draw you into any empathy towards them, or their plight.The ending is somewhat predictable and the only feeling at the end was a thankful sigh that the credit were rolling.",Vacancy
200,will-05196,Above average slasher,7,19 March 2018,"Not a perfect movie, but if you go into this with the expectations you should have of a slasher, you might be pleasantly surprised. Was a pretty effective thrill ride for the most part, an interesting premise, and they took the time to develop the characters, humanize them.... they are not the typical generic cardboard cutout stand-ins of your usual slasher.Nor are they just - how to put it - gore meat, there for the slaughter. They make a contest of it, and you are really not sure till the end if they are going to make it. Unlike a lot of the more cheesey and lame flicks (like Wolf Creek) the bad guys are not immune to error, and will not necessarily magically appear wherever they need to... you feel watching it like the prey has a fighting chance to make it out.The build-up is really well done. It's not too slow, not too fast, and the vids the guy finds in his hotel room are really pretty realistic and horrific.------------------------------------Spoilers------------------------------------Little details bothered me on occasion:-end scene when Amy calls 911, doesn't stress the need for an ambulance (husband still alive after all)-considering one cop has already been through, the hotel guy & his two killers leave the body of David sitting out in the open overnight?-why did one of the bad guys jump on top of the car to get her out of it (the car hadn't started or moved at the point he decides to jump on the car - wouldn't you go to the door to yank her out of the car rather than jump on the roof with intention to go through the windshield?-The escallation of events was a bit ham-fisted in a few places when subtlety would have been better - eg, when the ""fake 911 call"" happens, and a car barrels through the phone box, at the time I thought it was a bit of a tension killer... imagine if instead he realises they are still messing with him, is creeped out by something more subtle, and rushes back to the room to save his wife.In all, this is not a film for the ages, but you don't expect that going into a slasher, you expect a thrill ride, and this one delivers. Stands out head and shoulders above its peers in the genre, worth watching... turn off the lights, grab the popcorn & lock the doors.",Vacancy
201,catlin_massier,Expected A lot Scarier,6,29 June 2007,"It wasn't as scary as it could have been, it reminded me somewhat of Texas Chainsaw Massacre because of the group that works together to kill people, however we are not told if their a family or not. The movie started out slow and then progressed and by seeing the trailer you know whats gonna happen already, but If you hadn't it might have a scarier affect on you. The killing scenes were more of a suspense kill than a gore kill because it wasn't all that graphic. Luke Wilson, plays a Husband who is getting divorced with his Wife and his family doesn't know which gives you a bit of romantic sympathy as they are fighting together to stay alive. It wasn't the best movie I have seen but It was a good one, next I am going to watch ""1408"" while I'm in the mood, and I hope it gives me what this movie didn't have to offer.

202,Crackhouse2,They check in....,8,12 April 2008,"I started watching this film not knowing anything about it, a friend lent me his copy merely saying i'd enjoy it. He must be a good friend because i really did enjoy it. It starts by setting the context surrounding around the two main characters David & Samantha Fox, a divorcing couple who seem to loathe each other's company from the outset. After making the typical mistake they all do in these style films and not staying on the inter-state, they wind up in some backwater area of middle America. Luckily though they get some help from a stranger and they're sent back on their way. Unlucky for them their lovely BMW encounters some engine trouble and they have to high tail it to a nearby motel, where they enter the reception to the sounds of shrill screams coming from the office, from which i quirky little man emerges to greet them. Needless to say he pauses his light entertainment and offers them a room. They inevitably retire to their room where a series of strange bumps and bangs sets them on edge. Meanwhile, David Fox starts watching one of the motel's videos. Amidst all the violence inset he slowly realise he is actually in the set and it appears they've been doing this for some time down to some of the 70's hairstyles of the victims on the videos. With alarm bells ringing they realise they have to find a way out of this death trap. Anyways, the plot develops and you start to feel more for the couple who seem to slowly rekindle their love for each other. There's a few twists and turns and compounding of stereotypes, like the trucker who at one point could be there salvation, but no, he's one of those dissociative deviants who gets off on other people's misery,for Pete's sake, there must be one normal trucker in America. All that aside, this film makes great viewing and i'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre. Just be careful what motels you may check into in the future.",Vacancy

205,rpannier,"A well made, suspenseful thriller that builds nicely and avoids the blood and gore-fest. (possible spoiler)",8,17 June 2007,"When I first started watching the film I was hoping this was the set-up couple for the real victims. The couple was endlessly whiny (wife) and annoying (husband).The rationale for their annoying behavior didn't make me any more sympathetic towards the two of them. As the movie got going, it went through the predictable cliché-ish 'other characters.' Mechanic and Motel Manager. Once they were in the room, something amazing happened -- the characters started doing intelligent things. When there was the strange knockings on the door, the husband did what most normal people would do -- he tried to confront the unknown idiot and the next room and then went and got the manager. When he figured out that the movies were taken in his room, he analyzed them for any clues they might have. I was actually impressed that the characters in the film stayed smart and did reasonable things, rather than do the same idiotic things I see in most films. The last ten minutes are a bit of a downer (IMO). I found the ending contrived and forced. But, at the same time I did find it nice they avoided one annoyingly old cliché of so many of these types of movies. I won't mention it, I'll let you figure it out. I also appreciated the fact that the movie avoided the need to throw blood everywhere, as if that makes the movie more suspenseful, intense and/or scary. I must say it kept me engrossed.

208,Trelloskilos,pretty vacant....,2,1 August 2007,"*Review Contains spoilers* Vacancy: A very interesting premise, turned into a very lackustre film The premise is a slight twist on the classic ""When a stranger calls"" urban legend (You know, the one with the babysitter who keeps getting calls from some creep asking if she's checked the children, but anyway...). A dysfunctional couple are forced into taking a room in a nearby motel when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, late at night. Once in the hotel room, they decide to settle down & watch some TV. The husband puts a video cassette & discovers that the videotape is of a snuff movie. Worse...they discover to their growing horror, that the movie is set in the very room that they're in! Then, the lights go out....Very cool premise, definitely, but the problem is how to fill it out to a full featured movie? Also, considering that the majority of the audience going to see the film will already know the bare bones of the plot in advance, what else can you provide to keep them on the edge of their seats, and keep them guessing? Now, there are several approaches that the director could have taken. For a start, why not get the whole plot device out of the way in a 5-10 minute intro, showing the previous motel guests meeting their fate, Then focus on the main couple. After all, that's exactly what happens in all those classic psycho-thrillers like Psycho, Dressed to Kill, When a Stranger Calls, and even Scream. There's no sense in prolonging a story that people already know with a slow-burning start, only to get to the actual crux of the story about half-way in. It's just a suspense killer......talking of no sense, the couple and the characters displayed absolutely no sense at all during several scenes. Simple logical steps, like covering the camera lenses, or putting something heavy on the trapdoor in their room might have helped to increase their chances of survival. - The protagonists are also pretty dumb. How about smashing the glass of the motel window if they wanted to get in that badly? (Was it just me, or did anyone notice some continuity issues with regards to whether the door was latched or not?) Also, if the couple just seems to vanish, it's a pretty safe bet that they have discovered the trapdoor. Final kicker. All things considered, why didn't the couple just use the ceiling space in the first place? So aside from the fairly dismal acting, slow-burning story, dumb & unengaging characters, & illogical leaps from both sides...there's also a truly horrible ending. It's not the worst ending in the world, but it seems so forced, and...well...lame is a pretty good word. From a directorial point of view, there was a bit of a slap in the face drama-wise. After the heroine kills the main bad guy, there are repeated shots of him on the floor, as if to say 'just checking'. You half-expect the body to go missing, cos you never know if they might do a Vacancy II, & in the true horror/thriller franchise, the killer must disappear, or at the very least, pop up again for one quick cheap shock, but no. He stays dead, and the sappy ending is left to play out its course. Maybe the screenwriter was trying to build suspense using reverse psychology, or maybe they already knew that the film wouldn't be that good, so they didn't bother setting things up for a potential sequel.Anyway, to summarise; a great premise & potential for a thriller/horror plot, but seriously let down in execution.",Vacancy

If I had gotten worked up over it, expecting a big, fresh, psychological thriller, I think I would have had other things to say about it, but for me, it was just what the doctor ordered for an otherwise lame Monday night. The couple that gets chased around the motel from hell is likable enough that you actually want to see them survive, unlike a lot of horror movies where the main characters are so dense and annoying that you wonder why they're lasting so long. There isn't too much annoying back story, or long sentimental ending (although it's not entirely absent, either).

I would have expected a hell of a lot more from a director (and movie-lover) of his caliber... to say the least! This was a definite B movie, and a pretty unimaginative one at that. Strictly by the numbers. Everyone seems to praise the fact there was (virtually) no blood on display, but I'm not really sure that's such a great accomplishment, unless you're worried sick about (your) teenaged kids seeing too much blood in movies -- and something tells me this one, not particularly high profile or successful movie isn't going to make a huge amount of difference there...Kate B was considerably better than usual, it must be said. Would have expected a bit more from Frank Whaley. Luke Wilson's character has a look of permanent irritation -- which, I suspect, almost everyone in the audience did as well, and thus he was able to get your sympathy (also for not slapping the annoying character played by Kate). Otherwise he played with the same gestures, emotions and of course voice that he always does.Hopefully Nimrod was just ""paying his dues"" with this one and will come up with a decent film next time around -- though he probably stands a better chance of that happening if he makes it back in Europe.",Vacancy

216,asia_extreme,Another disappointing horror of 2007,4,15 June 2007,"From seeing the trailer I was actually quite excited about this movie, I thought it was a very interesting concept. Generally thinking about the situation you realise the fear that could be experienced, imagine being trapped in a room, and not only that you have a few guys desperate to kill you in a horrific way, pretty terrifying isn't it?! From watching this movie you wouldn't think it was so terrifying, I felt no fear for the characters whatsoever. I was thinking how terrified I'd be in that same situation, I'd be panicking and generally having a mental breakdown with the fear, yet watching these characters in the situation didn't show me any of the true fear elements. I think generally the directing was off, he didn't know what he was doing in the whole horror department. There was no real tension or suspense really, there was a short scene where they were going through a tunnel but it was hardly nail biting stuff. There was the occasional jump moment but it was so predictable and not even enough to make you jump, he director used the whole silence and then extremely loud noise to try and get you, but it was just too predictable.There was character building at the wrong moments, it was fine when they first went into the room and Luke Wilson was apologising to Kate Beckinsale for being a bad husband and for making them have problems ending up in them seemingly hating each other etc... then about 40 minutes later after being chased through the tunnel Kate Beckinsale has a crying moment and apologises to Luke Wilson for the problems also, why o' why??!! It was a completely unnecessary moment in the film, purely what I'd call 'filler'.In the end Luke Wilson is stabbed, after about 5-10 minutes of screen time Kate Beckinsale gets to him and she's able to phone the police. Thats where the movie ends, first of all I'd like to comment that Luke Wilson was stabbed when it was night, not sure what time of the night but it was certainly dark. When Kate Beckinsale finally got to him it was light, so I'm saying it would've been at least an hour later, it's just a little unrealistic that he's still alive after that amount of time lying on the floor seemingly unconscious and bleeding. The way it ends was bad, she stabs the Motel manager, the camera goes back to his bloody corpse about three times, then follows Kate Beckinsale outside for the end scene. Why show the body that many times? The only time it would've been good for a cliché horror moment it didn't happen.Lets be fair though, how many times has the whole car broken down scenario happened in a horror, come on change the record please!I hate rating movies badly, I put myself into the position of the creators, I know how much hard work and countless hours go into making a movie so I know it must hurt to read bad reviews, but at the same time if you want to improve you must know your faults. I've given the movie 4 out of 10 which I feel is quite generous. I must admit I wasn't ever bored watching this movie, it easily passed the time but failed to get any reactions which you'd expect from a horror. Generally as a way of filling 80 minutes it works, but as a movie in the horror genre it doesn't.",Vacancy
217,ChristinaZee,Decent flick with a suspense factor that is REAL!!!,7,27 April 2007,"I think that the reality of this movie is the frightening part. There are people who are like this out there...

They break down and walk back to a motel, where the guy who works there DEFINES creepy... For real... He give me the willies...They get in the hotel room, and there is nothing on TV, no cable... They pop a movie in that looks like a murder-horror flick, and all the sudden, he realizes that the filming took place in the room they are in... It gets crazy from there...I don't wanna ruin the movie, but I do want to say that the movie is filmed very well and the suspense is good, I jumped a few times...

218,ben_andreas91,Seen it all before,2,20 September 2008,"I wanted to see this film to just offload a bit. I am a big movie fan, and I watch a whole lot. This was one of those films I just watched to get some eye candy. Of course, I did not expect it to be any good, but I actually did expect some tense and action packed scenes. The story has for one, got no originality at all. We have all seen at least one film where a group of people have been killed in a cabin or house in a isolated area, where nobody could ever help them. Sure, I have nothing against that. But what really bugs the hell out of me, is the dialog between the central couple in these types of films. The problems which they have, the way they sort them out under these literally mind blowing circumstances just simply makes my stomach want to throw up. When they did it in the film, I got really frustrated. Near the end I was pleasantly surprised when Luke Wilson got killed off (I honestly didn't think with my heart and soul that was ever the case). I mean, he got stabbed and bled out the whole night. I thought that going THAT far with him surviving would be extremely comical. But of course, it happened. He ""woke"" up with some random shake ritual and made out with Kate. I know this review was very messy, but I am really angry with exactly this. I know that films need to have some over exaggerated elements in them, but the dialog can be sharp and clean. The dialog and acting in this film were none existent.Nevertheless, I knew it wouldn't be anything fantastic, but I didn't think it would be so uncreative and unoriginal as this.If you care about watching films with good value, please do yourself a favour and never watch it.",Vacancy
219,sorwar-ahmed,Out dated and predictable,5,14 November 2007,"I watched the film last night, at the end of it I thought the story was out dated. The film starts with David (Luke Wilson) with his soon to be divorced wife, Amy (Kate Beckinsale) driving down a dark country road and the engine of their BMW starts making funny noises. De Javu anyone, (Breakdown, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, etc, etc, etc).Just then, miraculously a garage appears next to a creepy motel. Luckily for the couple they caught a very friendly yet a novice mechanic before closing up for the day. He takes a look at the engine and also advises them that the car should take them to their destination 30 miles down the road.Surprise, surprise a couple of miles later the car totally breaks down. And the courageous David decides to walk down to the garage, even though the clever Amy reminds him that the mechanic has gone home for the day and it would be safer just to spend the night in the car. David is having none of it and the couple walk back to find the garage closed and go to the motel for help. They are greeted with a woman screaming, while Amy's intuition was on red alert and begging David to walk away, the ever so brave David hits the buzzer and a creepy looking pops out. The manager apologises for the screaming which was coming from a tape convinces David to spend the night and offer them the Honeymoon Suite for a discounted price.The rest of the film is very predictable. It's a cat and mouse chase between the two couple and 3 sick men who have brutally beaten people to death, as shown on the films which was on display for the couple's entertainment. The couple now must find a way to escape.5/10.",Vacancy
220,ThrowntoReality,Nothing too new or interesting,2,9 January 2010,"This was actually the first film I ever watched in Blu-ray. I mainly watched it because of the visuals, which are great. Sadly, it would come to show that it is the only thing that was good about it.First out: the story. Now while it actually isn't too bad I can't say that it's original in any way. If you ever saw ""Psycho"" you know what I mean, and that was 50 years ago! There are however some original ideas that makes it worthwhile for fanatics, like the tunnels and the fact that the whole place is full of cameras.The second complain I have is that even if it seems like the couple in the story are more clever than other characters in many horror movies, they aren't at all. They never think of using the items around them as weapons, which makes them an easy target and they never get the idea of destroying the cameras, which means that the killers can keep watching their every move.The third complain is simply that there are no likable characters. Even in the scariest, worst, classic and most random horror flicks (Scream, Dracula, Alien, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Sixth Sense to name a few) there are at least one character that you can relate to, find interesting or laugh at. But here, you have a total of six different characters and none of them are fun to watch. This is probably one of the worst aspects of the movie, since it makes it boring, tiring and uninteresting.Final words, this is just a boring rip-off of ""Psycho"". I don't really see any point behind it except for making money and the fact that horror movies are more popular than ever.A second thing that's good about it (except for the visuals) is that the last scene where Amy tries to get away was pretty good. I give it credit for that, but it doesn't make it more worthwhile or entertaining in the long run. It does, however, make me want to rate it 2/10 rather than 1/10.If you're a hardcore fan of horror movies, check it out.",Vacancy
221,horton-2,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time,1,19 August 2007,"I don't think I've ever seen so many stupid things in one movie than in this one. One of my biggest pet peeves is when main characters do obviously stupid things repeatedly throughout.This is one of those Hollywood fabrictions that involve the main characters doing stupid things over and over again in order to keep the story going. If in fact if they didn't do those stupid things they actually would have made it safely away from the motel without incident. However, that's not a movie so thus stupidity reigns.Some stranger is banging on the door in the middle of the night? Hey, let's not use the peep hole and then undo the chain lock before opening it nice and wide and looking around.One of the only two thoughts of arming themselves in this movie was in breaking a mirror by punching it, thus cutting his fist up, and going to fetch a gun that's displayed on a plaque. How many people keep loaded pistols up on a plaque? He was standing RIGHT below the said plaque earlier in the movie as well. He also had a towel rack bar in his hand that he used to break the window with but then tossed aside. Nyah, it's better to leave the room with nothing than a large metal rod. Hey, they have a nice shower rod that they could use! Wait, let's hang it back up in the shower. What the hell was with that? I can go on and on.

224,ugurel,not a real thriller,5,16 June 2007,I watched the movie last night and found really annoying. Firstly it is a short movie than I expected. Just 77 minutes. How can you make a tension in 77 minutes? It is a cliché that one has a trouble with is car and finds a place to stay overnight. But the place is full of magic. The manager is a psycho that he records while killing. Our couple stacks up in a room and can not even escape. There is no logical explanation that they have fear about knocking door later. I also did not understand the last scene. How did David survive all the night with a lot of blood loss? And why did the guys realize that Amy could stay under the ceiling?,Vacancy
225,Nolf_,"good start, Great middle, but loses steam at the end",8,17 May 2007,"Vacancy is a good and suspenseful thriller where the good guys, David and Amy Fox (Wilson and Beckinsale), have as much control over what is happening to them as the audience. Wilson and Beckinsale carry the film well, and the homicidal bad guys are pretty damn creepy, but there really is no character development at all. So if you're not a fan of Kate Beckinsale or Luke Wilson in general, then you probably won't care so much for them. Luckily, though, the film is not a thorough character study or an in depth look at a crumbling marriage - it's just a game of cat and mouse (that makes a stab at the idea of snuff films). And, as an avid horror film fan, I can say that this game starts out great. The first twenty to thirty minutes is very intense and unsettling. You feel as uncomfortable and uncertain as the Fox's. Unfortunately, towards the end, the films begins to putter out and becomes a bit predictable. But the hour and a half I spent watching it was a fun, adrenalin packed hour. If that's all you're looking for, this film is for you. After you step out of the theatre, you won't be looking over your shoulder as you walk to your car, want to whip out your night light when you get home, and you won't need to check the closet or under the bed before you go to sleep. Maybe you'll think twice about staying over at a shady motel, though.",Vacancy

They get annoyed by knockings and whatnot. Typical ""cheap scare"" movie. Make the sound super soft and then a LOUD noise to get that cheap scare. Anyway the plot for this movie is just AWFUL! There hardly is a plot at all. The couple ends up watching a tape and it's a video of a couple getting beat up and they figure out it's the same room their in. They try to escape, they find secret underground tunnels in their room, the whole movie it's nothing but them trying to escape. They call the police and the police ends up getting killed by the manager. They should have called this movie Motel Employees vs. Customer. That's all this movie is, the Motel manager and sidekick trying to kill this couple for no apparent reason. There is hardly any deaths in this movie either. Just the cop dies (You don't even see it, you just see the blood dripping), then the 2 Motel employee 1 gets hit by a car and the other was on top and last the Motel manager gets shot. What really upsets me the most was how it ended. The cops are called and she just sits there on the ground with her wounded husband, that's it!

But if you asked for my honest opinion of this movie, I would have to say that's it's the most disappointing movie I have ever seen on screen. It sounds, no offense, like it was written by a seventh grade kid. The actors in the movie are great actors, but I got from them no character relationship whatsoever. It was just Luke Wilson and Kate B. on the screen. The lines were very cliché. Every circumstance was so far fetched that it was COMPLETELY UMBARABLE. The first fifteen minutes of the movie is dark and slow, and it turns out that this is the best part of the movie. I have never wanted my six bucks back so bad in my life!

229,gswanson17,"Linear Thriller, Avoids Pitfalls of Genre",7,22 April 2007,"Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and David Fox (Luke Wilson) are returning from an arduous family reunion, on their way to Los Angeles. On their trip they encounter car problems and inevitably pull into a motel Norman Bates could feel right at home at. After some awkward exchanges with the owner, they reluctantly decide to spend the night. Upon viewing some tasteless horror films in the room, David begins to suspect their authenticity, and that these are actual murders taking place. Furthermore, he is led to believe the room that these events take place in is none other than the room they are currently residing. With this initial set-up, Vacancy wastes no time launching the audience into an engaging, gripping, and somewhat macabre story while borrowing sparingly from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and managing to side step many land mines other horror films fail to see. Vacancy has both positives and negatives going for it, however the negatives don't seem to affect the narrative as frequently as in other films. The first thought that came to my mind was its running time. At eighty five minutes, the film may move at too brisk of a pace for some, and at times it feels like it should be part of a short horror film festival, rather than a stand alone feature film. The clichés are very apparent as well-the broken-down car, the mysterious stranger, the out-of-range cell-phone, and the creepy hotel are included, but rather than using them as a crutch for a poor script, the film seems to celebrate their existence. It epitomizes all horror films where the main characters are stranded, encounter mysterious people or creepy locations. The film also fails to successfully flush out the ""snuff"" film aspect that was so heavily advertised and anticipated. The screen time of these films is very limited and the focus on them is brief. They serve as an fundamental set-up, but after their initial appearance, they fall out of sight and out of mind.What makes the film much more successful than the average ""teen slasher"" horror film is, ironically, the absence of teens in the film. In recent years the most successful horror films, in my opinion, like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, Stir of Echoes, and Hide and Seek all revolve around families, and in particular, the relationships between adults. In Vacancy, Amy and David are a married couple one argument away from a divorce and unlike an amorous, oblivious, teenage couple about to become mincemeat for an axe-murderer, the tension between David and Amy puts them on edge throughout the whole film and translates to tension in the audience while the film builds its suspense. The build of the film also differs from the main pattern set by modern ""slasher"" films. Winding like a key, the tension never lets down, and unlike the ups and downs of ""slasher"" films where there are multiple apexes of horror, there is a ratchet effect in Vacancy, where there is no relief and each scene is built upon the previous one. The other very obvious asset to the film is its relative lack of violence compared to most other modern horror films. In recent years, films such as the Saw series, Hostel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hills Have Eyes have lazily resorted to the shock factor to scare their audience rather than rely on the old saying ""It's not the bang that is scary, but rather, the anticipation to the bang."" That's not to say that the film isn't violent free, there is some definite violence involved, but in comparison to other films it seems, dare I say, minimal or practical.The references to Hitchcock's Psycho are refreshingly flattering rather than annoying. In Disturbia, a recent loose remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window, the similarities become annoying and the film loses its intrigue. In Vacancy, the nods to Psycho are very slight. The Pinewood Motel itself is the most obvious example which, like the Bates Motel, is in serious need of redecorating. The beginning credits also throw back to Psycho with its vertical bars violently moving around to forceful string instruments. There are similar references to Halloween as well, but the one thing the film lacks is the characters' emotional dilemma and their feelings of guilt involved in their situation. In Psycho it is Marion's (Janet Leigh) moral dilemma over stealing the money, and in Halloween it is Laurie's (Jamie Lee Curtis) feelings of social inequity. Amy and David do not share this external baggage-their troubled relationship is seemingly repaired through this trial that they are put through and not manifested by a killer such as Michael Myers or Norman Bates. There is no name given to whoever pursues them and there is no correlation that can be drawn between the characters and their tormentors. All in all Vacancy hits a few high points and is a smart enough film to stay clear of areas where previous horror movies have failed (horrible twist endings such as in Identity). Vacancy has a decent build of suspense, the exclusion of gratuitous violence helps, and the characters are more likable than those of the average horror movie. The letdown is that the film doesn't take any substantial risks. It follows a very linear path, with no deviations, and stays almost exclusively at the motel. It is a film that will entertain, but won't allow for too much out of the box thinking.",Vacancy

They were just so bland and generic.Also: Who were the killer thugs and what motivated them? How could that murderous operation have existed without suspicion? Why put cassette tapes in the rooms for the couple to see, or, if so, where was the payback? The sheriff would have called for backup immediately he discovered something was very wrong. The general ""tunnel mechanics"" of the plot could have been better worked - at times they seemed quite contrived. Etcetera. Worst mistake - for me - was that the husband was still alive the next morning. Impossible - I just don't believe that the thugs wouldn't have finished him off once they had gotten hold of him. (It also robbed us of a wonderful irony - had he died: that their marriage had just been saved - and potentially have turned schlock into cinema.) Mistakes like these reduce the intensity of our hypnosis, and weaken our emotional experience.I feel they started shooting the movie too soon - they had an excellent premise (""Psycho"" template - ""If you're gonna rip something off, rip off a winner!"") and it seems they had some money, and thus the potential to create a really useful piece of cinema.

241,Brandonjohansen22,Deffinition of a Mediocre Movie,6,21 April 2007,"When i first saw the previews for Vacancy i was a bit skeptical, but due to the excessive amount of advertising, some how i became intrigued. The plot i have to say was well thought out, but on the other hand at times the movie it self was near ludicrous. I was hoping that you would see a great deal of lead up to the actual horror scenes, if you will, but no. All we got was that a married couple that were seeking a divorce and had some how lost their son. Instead of a back ground we get nearly the entire 80 minutes, which by the way is absurd for a movie, of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale trying to escape the 2 masked psychos who have absolutely terminated dozens of people as seen in the videos. Unresonable??? Yes. We all know that if a cop goes out after a mysterious call about people trying to kill someone, they most likely wouldn't go alone. So they were short staffed. Well if an officer doesn't respond after hours, the word backup has to creep into your mind. Something i don't even want to touch on but i will is Luke Wilson is dead. plain and simple. Are they trying to tell me these vicious killing machines decided to only stab the person that put up the biggest fight once. Highly doubtful. Tell you what i was sitting by some kids who looked like they were about 8 in the movie theaters. They probably loved it, Me, I guess I'm just not that gullible.",Vacancy
242,richshire,"A couple checked in to a motel, will they check out ?",8,21 April 2007,"Vacancy is a shot of thriller mix with a shot of horror served straight up,no ice, in room temperature. A great great movie for this type of genre OBVIOUSLY not for everyone, but if you are a fan and feel a little down about many other so called horror, thriller movies that are simply S*@T, movies that are relying on fancy special effects or remakes of other films from the past or different country LATELY, well, this would be the one movie you won't feel crappy paying full price for. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckensale ( perfect cast ) play a couple who check into a motel after a long drive,the rest is an intense ride That will glue you eyes to the screen.I see the movie as a tribute to the 70's thriller/horror/action ( home invasion, psychotic killer type of films )You can see this right from the opening credits. There are moments where Vacancy could go bad and disappointing ( I was actually waiting for it )but it did not ( a bit on the ending being cliché, but I was OK to give it a pass ).WELL DIRECTED, WELL CAST, AND WELL SHOT.",Vacancy
243,windcriesmary,"Simple, at times predictable story, but still entertaining",6,21 April 2007,"The hype for this film had me pretty excited to see it. I like both Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson. I like to watch pairs on screen, to see how they work together. Some work very well, and others don't. In this case, Beckinsale's and Wilson's characters are not supposed to work well. They portray a couple inches away from divorce who has lost a son. From the beginning you begin to sympathize with them and ask how they got to where they are. In short, the beginning does a good job in drawing you into the story as a whole.That ""story as a whole"" however, was rather simple and usually pretty predictable. At most parts, I found myself saying ""Knew that was going to happen"". Especially in thriller flicks, I love when the story delivers an intense ""never could have guessed that"" twist. This movie has no twists other than the ones already revealed in the trailer.Another thing that had me a little dissatisfied was the fact that some things felt repetitive. I suppose that's going to happen when the movie, lasting about an hour and 25 minutes, depicts events happening in a single night.However, I don't want to sound like the movie was terrible. In fact, there were various other aspects that I was rather pleased with. The villain was purely entertaining to watch. Beckinsale and Wilson were great. The visuals were definitely frightening, and there were some pretty cool classic horror film moments that I enjoyed as well.Vacancy is a good film, but nothing more. I don't see how they could have made it anything more. If you're looking for a simple, entertaining evening, it will probably sit right with you. If it's a mind blowing, hit you smack in the gut, ""one of the 10 best this year"" film that you want, you probably won't enjoy it as much.",Vacancy
244,hhcosmin,good parts but fails to impress,3,16 February 2011,"just seen this movie. i am quite angry because i wasted my time so you know my general impression. now... let me tell you from the start that i'm not a big fan of ""blood on the wall"" movies where the story is ignored and all you get is mindless violence, gore and junk like that. i like to see a story in a movie and this movie has almost none. so the movie has some nice potential to start with. the atmosphere is dark. some guys get off the main road and their car breaks and they end up at a creepy, in the middle of nowhere, motel. this is what you know form the movie description. the clerk is strange, the room is crap and strange, someone starts banging on the walls so the atmosphere is building up. the guys panic, they discover some more strange stuff and that contributes to the atmosphere. so this was building up, but...---moderate spoilers--- there are numerous scenes where the couple hugs and tell each other how much they love each other... when the sickos are on to them and trying to hack them. the banging walls and door are nice but unrealistic as they seem to be a formidable obstacle even when they are made of plywood and glass. the buildings are the kind you see in America only made out of cardboard. the guy survives stabbing a whole night and is left in the open even if the sickos seem to hide everything. the part that made me stop the film was the super lame scene where one of the sickos has 3 chest wounds and the woman frisks him and he is still alive shot three times in the chest... so... you know the rest... another lame thing is that this guys, sickos and victims, run around like mad cows and defy logic at times. another thing that is dumb is that the woman gets beaten up by a skinny short sicko, her own size, and she does not throw a punch at him, while being thrashed around. also the man also does not seem to care to arm himself with a stick even and neither the woman. the movie could have been sort of nice even if the base story was used so many times. has some nice parts, builds the atmosphere etc. the execution however fails to carry its own weight.",Vacancy

It has been awhile where you can actually picture a horror movie being realistic. No zombies, ghosts or other iconic cold blooded killers like a Jason or Mr. Myers. Instead I was brought back to my youth where I can clearly remember staying in a motel like this one. Run down looking, filthy room and crazy looking staff. Back then I had no choice, today I doubt I would ever stop at a motel like that. Back to the movie though, I enjoyed how it cut right to the point and did not feel the need to go around killing everyone just to do it. Instead they gave a little feedback into the main characters threw in a reason to stay at the motel and watched the two of them reconnect again. No real need to go into much more detail - just enjoy the ride. And always have AAA just in case.",Vacancy
247,johanhamers,Definitely the worst movie of the last time!!!!!!,1,7 August 2007,"This movie is about a young married couple Amy and David Fox. They get lost and then their car ends up breaking down. They go and stay at a Motel. The owner of this motel want them death. That's the whole story! No plots, no twists. The movie even gives us no explanation why that the owner does this. Nothing! It's never exciting. A few guys with masks who are knocking on doors and are walking with knives. I don't get it! Why? Why? David Fox is being attacked and we have to think that he is murdered. At the end of the movie he opens his eyes....Oooooh, he's alive! Duh!? Kate Bekingsale and Luke Wilson obviously needs the money. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever! No not one of the worst....the worst! I'm sorry!",Vacancy
248,rambrandt1234,It'll getcha!,6,13 June 2007,"Generally, when the previews give away the essence of the plot, it's hard to be scared when you know what's coming. Not so with this one. I already knew about the 'vacancy' at the desolate road-side inn and the element of terror that would arise when they looked at the videos in their room, so the first 20 minutes of waiting for them to get there was rather boring. But when they finally do, that's when everything I thought I knew becomes the fodder of my doubt as to how the events will unfold. Luke and Kate are great as the argumentative couple with a grim secret that keeps them at odds and unsuspecting of the eventual horror they're entering into when they get a room. The videos are just a pretense to what would become any vacationers worst nightmare. The obvious frailty of the previous victims to the events leading to their demise draws you into this couple's eventual horror when they realize they are very well living out the last hours of their lives. But when they realize that a game is afoot, the real excitement begins as their survival becomes a winnable option, if they can figure out how to keep away from the hotel 'staff' long enough to get to safety. The terrifying two-thirds of the movie after they get a room is well worth the ticket!",Vacancy

As a horror film it was totally effective and creepy and I even had to hide my eyes once or twice. The only complaint I have is of the scene toward the end with the beating of Beckinsale at the hands of the main villain-it was a little too real and, I thought went on a few seconds too long. I guess an argument could be made about what constitutes horror as opposed to realistic portrayals of violence (are'nt they one in the same)? If you have an aversion to graphic violence, I would not recommend it. Otherwise, it was a good choice. Also, LOVED the opening credits. The graphics and music were very reminiscent of late 60's early 70's suspense/thriller classics.",Vacancy
250,Rayweiser21,"Predictable, but entertaining",4,27 September 2007,"I went into this film, knowing the story. It is your typical Friday the 13th/Psycho/Hicktown Horror rip-off. However, it is entertaining to watch and uses the typical stunts and story line very well. It is a great, but small, cast and each actor does a good job of making the film believable.I gave the movie four stars, because it didn't surprise me. There was no unexpected twist or ""freshness"" that it added to the genre. Beckinsale and Wilson are a believable couple but I wanted to know more. If I cared more for them, it would make their dooming situation more tense. Plus, the crazies are not anything but one-dimensional maniacs. They rarely speak throughout the movie. The only thing I see them as is crazy people who love to kill with a camera.This movie could have been a lot better. It was fun, but it needed more originality.",Vacancy

It was just what you'd expect from a good horror film; some ""jumpy"" moments, a few disturbing (but not violent or gory) moments, some frightening parts and not too much blood and gore.I thought it was well-acted and well-directed. The storyline was great, apart from the fact that there was no explanation as to why those people were trying to kill the main protagonists of the film. I guessed it was just some kind of sick fetish. It was quite a scary film, but not violent or gory. Some moderate profanity. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who likes thriller movies, but who doesn't want the screen to be washed with blood. It was a gripping and suspense-filled movie, and I was gripping to the edge of my seat with sweaty hands all the way through.There were some violent moments, but there was no emphasis on any pain infliction (although pain infliction was shown, but very briefly) or wounds. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes horror movies that are more scary than violent.It was an alright film, not the best horror/slasher movie I've seen, but I certainly enjoyed it.",Vacancy
252,RDrrr,'Snuff film'? What's wrong with this picture?,1,17 September 2007,"Spoilers? The whole movie was spoiled. Otherwise with some good acting, I like Luke W., love Kate B. (quit smoking!), and Frank W. is good to see, but I'm disappointed they're associated with something cheesy like this... sensationalizing 'snuff' films is just a -bad- idea. The plot/thread is just too thin, short, shallow. You can see the director/producers have the skills to present a film like this with some 'craft'... from slick opening and closing production reminiscent of Hitchcock films/trailers... but... the cheesy 'snuff' films shown in this movie should appeal only to the worst motivations. I'm -really- disappointed they chose to have ""extended snuff scenes"" hyped on the DVD. Right... let's get some 'cheap thrills' watching more detailed brutal killings of random people, done in cheesy videotape style. Very Sad. Pushing the 'envelope' too far. I'd say those three actors are probably disappointed to be associated with commercialized packaging like that... trying to make 'snuff films' attractive, with 'extended scenes', brutal stabbing spasms, hanging, etc. Just a bit more sick than usual horror effects, because of their 'homey' nature. Save that for the documentaries. Gritty? Sick!",Vacancy
253,piccolo300000,The Makers Trust Your Intelligence,10,15 June 2008,"They don't make you feel stupid, they give you something that seems real. There isn't any sugar coating, no senseless nudity, just a claustrophobic atmosphere and tense build up that will have you on the edge of your seat, anxious to see what will happen next. It's the way a movie should be done, and makes for a satisfying late fright night.A thrilling horror shocker that follows a quarreling married couple, David and Amy Fox (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) that end up breaking down in the middle of nowhere and have to walk a few miles to a gas station/motel. The strange and creepy manager gives them the ""honeymoon suite."" The room is, of course, the worst motel room you will ever see, cockroaches, no TV channels come in, etc. With nothing to do, David begins watching the videotapes(snuff films) in the room. They both begin to discover that the films are real and were filmed in their room. They find themselves in a life or death situation and try everything possible to survive the night. If you liked the trailer and the synopsis or any of the actors, you will definitely find that you like this movie. When I first saw a trailer for the movie, I thought it looked good, but was a little hesitant because of the way that horror movies are made today (gore and bore). This film has a very good plot and is solid in structure. Even though you do not get the full back story of the characters, you get their painful story through the excellent writing. In the beginning, you don't quite get why they fight or seem to ""hate"" each other, but it doesn't take long to understand (maybe 15 minutes counting the beginning montage of credits). I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout almost the entire film, and found not one dull moment. Suspense and tension are the real deal in this movie, and it is done incredibly well. Lots of excellent camera angles and authentic startling sequences add to the tense nature of the film. The characters seem very genuine and real, the relationship between the main two characters is portrayed extremely well. Wilson and Beckinsale come off as a real couple with a history. Their acting is extremely believable, and the writing of the characters is done extremely well. Another great thing is that they aren't your typical brainless genre characters who get naked and drop to the floor when the killer approaches, they are much more real. They do everything that you expect that you would do if you were in their situation. They make good decisions, which make them much more realistic, winning sympathy rather easily. There are heart-pumping fight sequences, which were well executed and will make you cross your fingers for Beckinsale and Wilson. There are also tender moments that will add to your root for them. By the end you will want them to stick it to that manager for everything he's done and for a reconciliation between the two main characters. I enjoyed it ten fold, but you'll have to watch it to see whether they make it in the end.

256,jonny_c1990,Excellent Horror/Thriller,7,21 June 2007,"Probably inspired by Psycho and/or Motel Hell, this film brilliantly puts the viewer into the position of the victims throughout the film and therefore makes you worried when they are worried, scared when they are scared and hopeful when they are hopeful.Like the other two films I mentioned previously, this film is about customers walking into a motel to book a room and finding out later that the manager or owner is up to foul play, even when they seem very friendly at first. Although when the manager first appeared in this movie scary music played in the soundtrack to let you know he was the 'bad' guy, which, whilst we all know he probably will turn out to be the bad guy, was a bit of a cliché.Perhaps the most frightening part of the film was when the couple were watching the Snuff films that were set in their own motel room, and from that point on you were brought into the fear that the victims had.The funny thing about this film is that it's about slasher films, but yet isn't really a slasher film itself, but a hell of a good horror/thriller that makes you scared about the idea of Snuff films.With some excellent acting and suspenseful moments that leave you tense, if you want to watch a horror film that draws you in, this is one you should watch.",Vacancy

Just a few: bickering couple rediscovers love after a life-threatening (if improbable) event; their car breaks down and there is only a single hotel available in the galaxy; the desk clerk is a sleazeball, but they check in anyway; the grimy room includes the stained sheets, static-filled TV, 60s pendant lights and cockroach filled bathroom that we've all grown to know and love.

258,michaeljaeproject,Letters From A Critic,8,28 May 2007,"Dear Nimrod Antal, First of all, that can't be your name for real, but nevertheless, you certainly didn't live up to your name when making this movie. A nimrod couldn't have directed a movie better.Vacancy has one quality that many movies have been lacking lately. It knows how to get on the screen, give you a thrill ride, and then get off the screen. At 1 hour 20 minutes, this movie does pack quite the punch.You have picked a wonderful actress as Kate Beckinsale as your leading lady with Luke Wilson as your guy, and they did a great job portraying a couple stranded in the middle of nowhere and being forced to take refuge at a shitty hotel with a bathroom that doesn't have ample drinking water, furniture from the 1970's, and a VCR with a collection of videotapes on top of it.What this couple are about to discover is that these tapes contain snuff films and they were filmed in the ""honeymoon suite"" that they are staying in. Soon they learn there are cameras all over the property and soon don't know what to expect or what to trust. On one scene Luke Wilson calls 911 from a payphone outside of the hotel, only to learn it is the hotel manger/film director on the other line urging him to stay calm and he might survive. The hotel manager and two other men toy with the couple until they decide to make their move and go into the room to try to introduce them to their maker.One thing you did Nimrod in this movie that gave it that something was the photography. In the beginning of the movie, the use of the passenger mirrors on the BMW when Luke Wilson was fumbling with the car, you could see Kate's uneasiness in her eyes. Furthermore, I love the scene when the power goes out and you can see one of the two killers lurking in the bathroom behind her. Every time they ran into the hotel room, you kept thinking he was in there waiting to waste them. Brilliant. I also enjoyed the scene when the petrified couple ran through the tunnels under the small town and they had to make their way through the pile of rats. You felt the anxiety they did as they knew if they continued forward, they might get bitten by the rat, if not, they would die.This movie is yes your typical slasher film, but the circumstances that surrounded the movie made it stand out amongst a horde of horror flicks that have come out in the last year. One thing I appreciate about this movie is you took a real life situation that can happen to anybody. There were no unbelievable scenes. There were no stupid choices made by the actors. Everything was what any of us would have done in their situation. Everything the characters did was very well thought out and planned. And the biggest thing I loved about this movie, is that you didn't drag it on forever. You found a good place to call it quits, and you cut it. My complaint was the ending. Since my letters are open to the public, I don't want to divulge what happens, but the ending is left open for interpretation and I did not like that part. Either the main character(s) get away or get killed. To be left with a new situation I felt was pointless. The movie did its job.Vacancy is a welcome addition for your movie making skills in the states. I can't say I am familiar with your work, but I love your use of the camera and characters. Anybody can shoot a film about two people being stuck in a hotel with people trying to kill them, but when you make the small adjustment you did, you have struck a nerve in the audience. The movie becomes a thrill ride, which a horror movie should be, and you keep the audience in anticipation in what happens next. Vacancy is a short, fun, roller coaster ride that goes up a very long hill, but comes speeding down at 100 mph all the way to the fight to the finish at the end with a beautiful bloody scene with that BMW.Bravo Mr Nimrod, chug down three Amstels for me.Michael Jae.",Vacancy

When you watch a scary movie like this, you have to at least somewhat believe that how the characters react is believable. This movie is HORRIBLE as the script requires the actors to constantly do ridiculous things to ensure that it lasts the mandatory hour and a half. As usual, lazy Hollywood releases another garbage film. I would have turned the film off 3 times, but my wife likes to torture us to the end, no matter how awful.

Luke Wilson does a good job of playing a general everyman out of his depth but doing his best, while Kate Beckinsale is unfortunately not given that much with which to work; perhaps in some sort of nod to the 60s style setting she seems to spend a lot of time cowering behind her husband.There is very little plot to follow, and combined with the small cast means that the running time has to necessarily be quite short. However, despite being primarily centred in a single location there is not the sense of claustrophobia one would expect. The initial set up is quite slow, and thus the tension rises only incrementally prior to the ""slasher"" portion kicking in. Up until this point, things were progressing in a reasonable fashion and the tension was building. However, it almost seems as if there was some confusion or indecision on where to go with the plot. The film turns into a straight-forward cat and mouse situation and then the writers seemed to become bored and finish it all off in less time than they took on the initial ""being lost on the highway scene"".It's a pity as the promising start seems to just slump into an unsatisfying ending which doesn't really leave you feeling as if it was worth watching the film.",Vacancy

When it first started and it seemed to drag along, I thought that'd be it and that nothing else would become exciting. Also the creative use of credits in the main title was pretty silly, but the film was quite good. Kate Beckinsale was sure able to pull off a real bitch at the beginning of the film, but we then felt sympathy for her toward the end of the film, when she realizes she must work with Luke Wilson to survive, and she becomes more of a humble human-being. The suspense was surely well-used, as the killers would pop out and great sound effects would play along. The main villain was also well cast, since he really did seem freaky and weirdo-like.

It is full of cheap scares and they are 100% predictable. Are the characters hard of hearing?

Even tho the movie isn't long it still felt like it dragged because similar things happened throughout and I felt it became boring. The ending wasn't good either it wasn't what I expected but it was a good story just needed developing more. Also was scary in parts which took away the un-thought storyline of it.

268,anshul_meh,Damn neat,7,20 April 2007,"One can compare movie like this with a spate of recent thrillers that have been released in the past. Movies like Hostage, Firewall and Hitcher comes to my mind immediately. The reason why I am comparing this movie with them is simply because a viewer can go into any of these movies knowing exactly what to expect. The main plot line is exposed by the title itself, the movie's USP is ""being a thriller"" and above all, the movie does not boast itself to be movie of the year.The obviousness of the viewer's expectations makes the job of the director that much more difficult. The director has to always be one step ahead of the viewer. The moment he/she fails to do so, the movie loses its steam, the viewer is not satisfied, and the word of mouth does the rest.This is where Vacancy has its strengths. It is a damn neat thriller. Just saying ""it is everything a thriller should be"" might not do justice to the elements that were smartly incorporated in it that lead to that statement. These elements helped differentiate this thriller from all the above above: a) Length of the movie: At 85 minutes, this movie is a trifle short in length. This is much better than it being a trifle too long. I am sure at 115 minutes, this movie would have faced a huge challenge in retaining viewer's attention.b) Constancy of perspective: At no point of time, the movie showed what the villain was doing/thinking/facing. The audience was always with the main characters and had to wait for their move to know the plot. Mr. Hitchcock used this mode of storytelling in a lot of his movies, and Mr. Antal smartly borrows from him.c) Presence of loopholes: Oddly enough, a movie like this needs to have some loopholes. If an active effort is made in making a loophole-free movie, more often than not, it becomes a ""could have been better"" movie. Vacancy does not suffer from that problem.d) Opening Credits: This might not be significant for all. But to me, the opening credits set the tone for the movie. I was expecting that there would be a teaser of what lies ahead (like scene in hostel before credits) and then the credits would roll. Or else, there could have been credits that were placed while some scene was being played (like in firewall). But here, the credits played from word go, with smart music, and layout that fit the thriller genre.e) The ending: The ending was not completely closed. It was not as if the police came and everything was set alright. Like Wolf Creek when in the ending credits, they showed the hero attending funeral of its friends. Here, the movie completed when 99% of the thrill was over but the audience expected that there might be one last thing left. Say, may be the hotel manager would try and have a last shot at Amy. Had that happened, I would have come out of the hall feeling just satisfied, and not great as I finally felt.Overall, a smart thriller which was Intelligently made and marketed. The final product made the popcorn feel tasty.",Vacancy
269,m-garafalo,Awful,3,16 March 2008,"I rented this based on a recommendation that it was spooky and it has been an eternity since I have seen a movie that made my skin crawl. This movie started promising. Wilson and Beckinsdale were very authentic insofar as their spats in the car. It was dead on. They looked and felt the part of weary travelers. As usual though with horror movies, we are shown so many situations where disbelief is tested. No girlfriend in their right mind that I have ever had is staying in a motel where the caretaker looks as creepy as Frank Whaley's character, and even more..when the sound of woman being terrorized in the background is wafting out into the lobby. Even the most testosterone laded dude might have some reservations as well. The girl would always convince the guy..we are sleeping in the car. secondly..the guy that originally worked on there car...? He did not exactly give a warm fuzzy either...but yet Luke Wilson lets him tinker around his car at some ungodly hour blindly trusting him. As for the only scary part..which was the realization that they were occupying the same room as people already murdered..yes..nice touch..but it wore thin moments after. Anybody looking for these travelers? Was the motivation explained for these acts...of course not..the movie lasted 85 minutes!!!....Terrible..Can a director please realize that being scared is better than being grossed out or repulsed?..There is a reason why the sight of Michael Myers standing in broad daylight next to a laundry line is terrifying...There is an audience for gore..I know..but can you mix it with chills..Please...just once?",Vacancy
270,d4nyll,"Fantastic Idea, appalling execution",2,13 July 2010,"I wanted to watch this movie because I thought it was a great idea. It'd be interesting to watch people trying to escape of what I thought would be a enclosed room. What we got was a motel room with a single-glaze glass window, if this movie was Die Hard, or Mission Impossible, then this movie would have finished in about 1 minute.The place where I think it really did fall is the script. For example, when you first see the tape of people like you trapped in the room that you are in, you don't go and watch another one. You'd escape and run like hell. Secondly, the ""kidnappers"" had cameras all over the place, so I am sure they'd know where the characters are escaping; but no, it's one minute they know their exact location, the next minute they don't have a clue. Thirdly, you are telling me the manager built this whole motel JUST to make videos like that AND for the tens to hundreds of people they've killed, no detective in the whole of America suspected a thing. I can go on but I don't think this movie deserves any more of my time.Lastly, the side plot of the death of their child, I mean WHY? It is the writers' go at putting drama in this ""thriller"", but if they are to do that, then develop it more, a lot more. Don't just scrape the surface and leave it at that, poor.This film did not make me jump, or scared, in fact it did not arouse any of my emotions. Waste of my time.The best part of the movie was the aesthetics and lighting of the scene, especially the beginning, but that seemed also amateurish, so I gave it 2 stars.Give me $150000 and I can make a better movie, it might not have famous movie stars, but it will be better.

The acting is excellent and gritty with compelling performances from Beckinsale and Wilson, but all that I remember about the film in hindsight is the very poor ending.I would not watch it again, and I most certainly won't be watching the inevitable sequelI've marked this as a spoiler in case some people think this review gives too much away.",Vacancy

It had everything that a first rate thriller needs. The characters were believable. Instead of teeny boppers, or big chested blondes; they gave us a real couple. Luke Wilson, and Kate Bekinsdale really fit this role, and they fed off of each other very well. Frank Whaley was dead on, as the creepy motel manager. What was the best part of the film, was how the suspense was played out. The film used normal scares, such as lights flickering, banging on walls and doors; and the phone ringing with no one on the other line. In conclusion, Vacancy is a very good movie, and it is definitely worth the value.",Vacancy
273,rom_sade,There Was No Vacancy In The Theater!,9,20 April 2007,"Yes, the theater was full of people that loved it! I had the luck to watch this at the theaters. in a really early screening, here in Israel.Where ""Disturbia"" microwaved elements of ""Rear Window,"" the terse, relentless ""Vacancy"" borrows more sparingly from ""Psycho,"" which also was set in a seedy West Coast motel where guests have a tendency to never check out.""Vacancy"" sneaks into your brain from the get-go by skillfully exploiting several elements: the urban myth about the couple that watches some porn in a fleabag motel and suddenly realizes they are the porn stars, the paranoia of characters who think they're being watched (and they're right, since we are watching them) and our awareness of previous movies with similar mayhem.Specifically, I'm talking about ""Psycho,"" which ""Vacancy"" nods to in ways both small (the stuffed birds that appear everywhere, the use of mirrors, the look- and sound-alike opening credits) and large (the stalking of motel-bound characters, which relies less on gore than on mounting, claustrophobic suspense).Casting Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale in the lead roles is the first sign that ""Vacancy"" is smarter than the average horror movie. They're terrific as a bickering couple who get stranded in a dump where the night manager (Frank Whaley) might as well greet them with, ""Good evening. I hope your room will prove satisfactory until I get around to snuffing you out and videotaping it."" We know just enough about the couple to root for them as they're stalked by masked maniacs, but what drives ""Vacancy"" is its ingenious premise, from which director Nimrod Antal - who made the fine Hungarian thriller ""Kontroll"" (""Control"") - wrings every ounce of tension. ""Control"" is a good word for him. Antal has done a clever job of imagining the story in visual terms, right down to the way he frames the unlucky road trippers. Early on, as they snipe at each other, they're always separated by something (a wall, a mirror), even when they're together. But adversity forces them to cooperate, and, in the final scenes, the camera offers us some hope: At last, these Bickersons are depicted together in the frame, fighting for their lives.",Vacancy

Just a horrible idea that could so easily happen in real life. That's probably what really got to me. Sure, there are a few clichés in there but I think any of us these days would be hard pressed to name a totally original film.The two main characters are well drawn out at the beginning - not something that happens often in this genre. Characters with depth usually raise the quality of a film - and this is the case here. Good actors, too.

This shot the movie up into the high ratings for me, as it is rare to find a horror movie where the characters actually use their brains.The acting was also good, and the characters were developed well, so that I ended up really caring for the life of the two main characters, and their disintegrating relationship.Vacancy also had the right amount of build-up and tension.

You Don't just run away from them and try to hide. You hurt those a-holes back! You take them down one by one and you really make them suffer.

Overall the movie could not make me shiver or contemplate about the future. I kept wondering all the time as there are a lot of movies that did not earn acclaim but were better especially in terms of direction and the whole setup.

Where Wilson encounters a tape where these masked men are killing people people, but what starts the whole saga off, is that the killings were being taken place in there 'honeymoon suite'.

I thought it looked interesting, especially considering it contained two actors that you would not usually see in a ""horror"" or ""slasher"" movie, even though both these actors are not exactly phenomenal. I went to see it on opening day in the afternoon and the theater was packed with the whole 15 other people who decided to watch it with me. I was very impressed with the opening of the film. The music was very good plus the opening credits themselves were fun to watch. Luke and Kate play a married couple who are not very happy with each other and are constantly bickering on a road trip back home at night. When they break down they decide to stay in a small roadside motel. The manager is very interesting in that way of ""he seems nice but looks like he tortured animals as a child"" way. Soon after the couple gets into their room mayhem starts. I wont go into too many details, but there were many things I liked about this movie. First, as far as movies go nowadays, there wasn't much gore. I've been waiting for a movie that can make my twinge but keep the gore factor low. When I watch movies like Saw, I watch them just for that factor, and usually because of that, I am never scared. I just see amazingly makeup. However in Vacancy, while you get definite glimpses of true brutality, it leaves you wanting to see more which is much more successful than seeing too much. Another thing I liked about this was that the characters (moreso the husband) was smart, but not overly so, just had good common sense. I also liked that the movie didn't particularly focus on the killers as much. It seems like every horror movie these days is about some evil mastermind or demented insane killer. This movie however, discloses enough information about this to make them have some personality, but not enough to distract from the true message of the movie. Lastly, what I loved most about this movie, is that it could happen... to anyone. Even you.",Vacancy

Not the best, no, not even close, but at least it wasn't loaded with gore, sex, and profanity, plus completely predictable as though that isn't enough, like the new 'Halloween' remake. The characters had a little bit of a brain, figured things out and planned ahead. They didn't just run around screaming so that you were screaming at them, ""DON'T DO THAT DUMB *BEEP*!"" For this I greatly appreciated this film...you felt like you were trying to solve these characters' problems along with them, rather than wishing you could just TELL them the obvious solution to their problem.Overall, if you like these types of films, I don't think Vacancy will let you down.7/10",Vacancy

There was a lot of unsuspected jump scenes that done there job well. The plot was very simple but I thought it worked very well.While I was watching the film I couldn't help thinking of the similarities between this film and hostel.

I thought the director was very good at making the movie thrilling and scary. But the story kind of sucked and was very generic but the specific elements of the movie really add to the excitement. It was worth watching in theaters. I thought the casting was below average. I would not have chosen Luke Wilson as the main character because he is too associative to funny movies and he acted well but he didn't fit the part. The screenplay was poor in my opinion. The script was realistic but again the plot almost had no meaning to the story.

It's not really set in a secluded place, and it has a pretty big motel with a big parking a lot, so I didn't really get any suspense from the setting itself.In addition, there were so many other possibilities that the film ignored, such as that of those masked-people actually creeping into their room so that whenever the couple escapes into the room they'll think twice about its safety.Overall, its a good thrill, I wasn't really on the edge of my seat, but it has an interesting plot.Rent it out, but wouldn't recommend buying it.",Vacancy

My review will be as short as the amount of genuine, original thrills in this insipid waste of film. There isn't so much a body count as there is a cliché count.The only really good thing about this is Frank Whaley, (who most would remember as Matthew Broderick's sidekick in The Freshman) who creates a good creep-out factor as the motel manager.Now, it's not like I was looking for a splatter-fest. I have as much respect for the bloodless thrills as a Rear Window, or even a Halloween (which, yes, was bloodless!) as any discerning viewer.

Also every time that girl had the chance to run away she could have been miles from the hotel. instead she was dumb and just hid in another room. Another thing was that after the guy got stabbed he magically lived after laying there all night. He def. would have bled to death if not anything died from an punctured artery. The only good part I could say is that instead of only being scared in a few parts I was scared throughout the whole movie. It was very suspenseful. There was a lot of killing that seemed very exaggerated.,Vacancy

Such as knowing there's a stranger in the house, and then taking a shower!! Hello, you're asking to die, and anyone with a brain would have just left the house already. Vacancy is just the opposite. This was a well directed film, and the realism was portrayed with brilliant performances by Wilson, and Beckinsdale.

It was short and not drawn out like most other horror movies. However, the ending to the movie was by far the worst ending i have ever seen at the end of a horror movie. The movie was about 1 hour and 20 minutes long. I thought it was one of the best horror movies i had seen for about 1 hour and 10 minutes of it. The ending made it seem like a waste of 10 bucks. Other than the ending it was a good movie. Going to see it and expecting a good ending or expecting an ending that makes sense will only leave you frustrated with the movie. For that i give it a low grade. The acting was horrible, the plot ridiculous, and I laughed more at the stupidity of the characters then ever being remotely frightened. Which is a bad sign when the movie is being marketed as a ""horror"" film. Save your money. Not even worth a rental, unless you like to make fun of bad movies ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" style.",Vacancy

Nimrod Antal's direction is top notch and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout as he builds the tension with great skill and, on the whole, an amazing attention to detail. Paul Haslinger's score has to be commended too. Had to smile though ... David and Amy have exactly the same first names as the main characters in Straw Dogs.

A typical movie viewer would think that there would be plenty to create an amazing ending, but NO don't count on it. It's like they ran out of money or something while producing this film.There is no background to what happened to mess up their marriage. I think a child died or something, but who would know.

Nothing is realistic in this movie and the producers seem to care zero about making an sense whatsoever in the carrying out of the plot.

I've seen both of them in other films, but was most impressed by their acting in this one.

The beginning is very scary, but as the film goes on, it becomes obvious that both of them will survive. Anyone who is really into thrillers should be disappointed with the evolution of the film and especially the end, where the guy raises his head and comes out of the coma in a second. And of course, no one would believe the trick with the screwdriver into the car...what nonsense! Any decent thriller with this theme, would end like this : both of them try to get out of the room, scared to death and finally, the guys get them and kill them and tape them.

At least Vacancy has some decency behind it.Comparisons to Psycho are inevitable, what with a creepy motel owner advertising full vacancies, but this is about its only similarity.When the couple discover the snuff film and realise it was filmed in the very room they are in, I thought this was an excellent idea, and gives a great feeling of isolation to the characters.Despite this, I thought the chasing scenes were very drawn-out, and encompass most of the film, with not many unique plot twists or such like, which make a horror stand out for me. The anti-climax of the film was a bit disappointing to leave the cinema to as well.Overall, I think the main idea of the film is quite inventive, but the film itself is quite stale, basically consisting of the main characters running away from the motel owner and his accomplices.It is a decent watch, but isn't purchase-worthy for me, and doesn't stand out much.",Vacancy

I watch horror films all the time and this has got to be one of the worst I've seen. Rent it if you must but if you wanna waste your money just give it to me I will kick you in the nuts and you will have a better time than if you watch this movie. The beginning of the film is as the other reviews say a total cliché with their car breaking down but what movie of this type doesn't have such clichés. The Hotel manager is so obviously the baddie because as soon as you meet him hes strangely watching a tape of a woman screaming bloody murder. Hardly normal behaviour. Once the tension starts there is every indication it may be a good film but then the plot descends into a hammy victims running around screaming away from dodgy men in masks for the next 50 or so mins. Tension gone out the window by this point and the movie just gets worse and worse as the painful minutes go by. If you want a similar movie that at least has a good story and keeps you guessing till the end rent Identity.

That's just how good it is. I call good movies when they can stay in my head for a long time after watching, and with emotional involved too. How the director built the emotional issues between the couple was very well done and I enjoyed every thrill I felt as the terror came one at a time. The presence of Luke Wilson as an ordinary man, a regular person just like us is what I really adore here. I keep remembering how he can be sharp in such pressuring situation and manage to stay calm and logic. Most thriller movies feature characters that would at least act panic, do stupid mistakes or be the whining ones (admit it, you always know the whining ones will always be dead, sometimes first). This man was just not any of them. Usually the first hour of these kind of movies is all about the mystery and the next hour is about the revealing, the part when I sometimes push the fast-forward button if the scenes are too lame or predictable that I just want to know the result. Not this movie. The processes kept me watching and I enjoyed them. I give 10/10 because I couldn't remember any mistake in this movie, if there's any.

338,szurilo,great or bad ending?,10,19 June 2007,"I read a lot about the ending of this movie. Most of them said disappointing, pathetic ending. It ends so abruptly, seems the studio edited out a scene. Some said why is the camera pans out while the music is getting tens and high at the and of the film and nothing more happen? We think it is a must to happen something. And obviously most of us awaits a new killer or something tricky but the credits just start rolls. Now i watched the last 10 minutes again and try to think in another way, and thats what i offer you too. Lets see. When Amy called the police, they said ""Whats your name and your location?"" Amy said ""Amy Fox, we are at the Pinewood Motel. I don't know the address"" Previously David tried to call the police but he also couldn't give the proper address. Maybe the police try to locate the source of the call? No they don't :) Be rational when the police said "" OK someone is on the way"" they lie. Maybe Amy didn't speak with the police, maybe he spoke with another killer. Besides, Amy checked the owner of the Motel if he is still alive, and the camera shows us he is(as David of course, people don't die as faster in the real life as in the movies). So we can think as many times in the film the owner will soon coming back to act. OK, lets what happens next. Amy ran out and kissed David many times AND the tense music starts playing. Camera pan out, music takes higher and the movie not! suddenly ended. The mail title came out and we can sense the movie will continue.

Nothing was presented here.Presenting some snuff movie scenes and good scream is not enough to make a good horror movie these days. Some critics wrote it was nice having some adults with relationship problems instead of some teens on holiday - well Kate is also a chick and that is what I can say about this part of movie promotion.And finally the villains remain totally without any deeper impression - but what is a good horror thriller with a well-done bad guy? don't waste your time - see another movie",Vacancy

To say that this movie left me wanting more would be a gross understatement. Right off the bat when Luke Wilson somehow manages to spin a BMW out while avoiding a raccoon, I knew I was in for a campy ride and the thrills just kept...well, never coming but the clichés were one right after another. Once our two quarreling ""heroes"" make it to the hotel, they're greeted with screams and other noises that are intended to make the view think someone is getting a little somethin' somethin' in the back office. Realistically, an intelligent person would A)immediately know that there's supposedly something more sinister going on and B) would say ""Oh. I see what you did there"" and dismiss it for A.This movie, ultimately, is one you may want to watch if you really want to make yourself feel smart. The cliché horror movie music is well timed to spell everything out for you, and even the dumbest of people will be able to watch the movie and outsmart the villains. Subsequently, you will spend the movie yelling in vein at the screen TRYING to talk SOME sense into the characters. Naturally, they won't hear you and you'll end up frustrated.Overall the directing is terrible, the characters are stupid all across the board, the acting isn't what people claim it to be, and everything is as predictable as a Merry-Go-Round.

While you watch it, every single minutes you can feel like that the the husband and wife duo could have been attack at anytime. So you are always on cautious mode not to jump out of ur sit. I highly suggest people to watch this. Brilliant movie.",Vacancy
346,ektaka,Utter waste of time... stay away,1,20 August 2007,"What a cheesy, unbelievable waste of 85 minutes. After watching Underworld, seeing Kate's Zoloft/Prozac addicted girlie girl character was more painful and disappointing than the plot and ending of the movie. Luke Wilson's character was no better, doing stupid things like cutting himself while breaking a mirror to make a weapon that he never uses and generally being as effective as a rat in a maze, running around in circles. And what is up with this side-plot of the dead son that drives the couple to a divorce that they're driving home to finalize? It takes the threat of death for Luke to tell Kate that it wasn't her fault and he loves her? Of all the ridiculous scenes... And the fact that he remains alive hours after being stabbed multiple times pushed suspended disbelief to its limits as did the scene where the second 911 operator says, ""Duh, didn't we send a deputy out there already?"" Must be the Keystone cops that don't send help out when their deputy doesn't check in after responding to a 911 call. As satisfying as it was seeing Kate finally grow a backbone and a will to live and manage to kill all her sadistic assailants, this transformation from her former passive-aggressive, whimpering, Prozac-popping self just wasn't believable either. The movie would have been much better if it stuck to a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" mentality where no matter what the protagonists did, they were screwed... and I have to say that the protagonists in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" were much more likable than Kate and Luke. At least if the movie pushed it all the way and Luke was really dead and Kate was blown away even though she managed to take out a couple of the guys, it maybe would have been more believable and would have retained more of its shock value. Aside from all of the above, the gratuitous extended snuff film footage in the Special Features section is yet another reason to stay away from this one.",Vacancy
347,armanhaikia,Over-rated and predictable but had its moments,4,10 July 2007,"I don't know why people liked this movie so much. It was predictable, not-at-all terrifying slasher flick that you could just as easily have done without. From the start till the end it follows a linear trend that has become a trademark for horror movies. Night, car breaking down, creepy motel, psycho villain and the like. No new concept here.Probably the worst aspect of this movie is that it is inconsistent in its presentation. It starts out trying to be scary, with the hotel doors and walls banging while no one is out there. There is a time when you think that the villains are ""super-human"", it looks as if they can run very fast and are extremely agile, but later in the movie this whole concept just drops. Thats when the movie ceases to be scary and surfaces as just another I-have-people-trying-to-kill-me-type movie.Although I must agree that the presentation was good. The character development is quite unusual for the genre of movies this picture belongs to. You really start to care about the characters and start to hope that they can make it out alive and sort things out between them. Luke Wilson delivering his first serious part was top-notch in his acting while Kate Beckinsale (I expected a lot of her) was also quite convincing. But taking all variables into equation, the movie on the whole was just too familiar.I don't want to spoil anything for you because you may like this movie and I am also not saying it is bad, but not as good as other reviews may make you believe. So, if you are planning on seeing this movie, be-forewarned that it may turn into a disappointment if you expect to much of it.",Vacancy
