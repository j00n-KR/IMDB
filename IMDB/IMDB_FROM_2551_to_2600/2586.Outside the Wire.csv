0,Leofwine_draca,Not bad,6,22 September 2021,"A not bad Netflix sci-fi action movie with a familiar premise and plenty of action to take your mind off said familiarity. This one's a buddy-cop type thriller which sees a couple of soldiers posted to Eastern Europe to battle a terrorist insurrection. The main guy is a newcomer to acting and it shows, although Anthony Mackie is better in the show-off cyborg role. The first half is a little much when it comes to the plotting, but it segues into fun, JOHN WICK-style action in the second half and there's a lot of it too.",Outside the Wire
1,SnoopyStyle,This movie thinks that it's smarter than it is,4,19 January 2021,"The year is 2036. America is trying to keep the peace in Eastern Europe especially Ukraine. In addition to aerial drones, the military is also using robotic soldiers called Gumps. Drone pilot Harp (Damson Idris) disobeys order and fires a missile close to the troupes killing two American soldiers. For his reprimand, he is reassigned to follow Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie) on an out-of-the-box ground mission to track down pro-Russian terrorist leader Victor Koval who aims to start a nuclear war.Ukraine doesn't have nukes. Even with the most outrageous conspiracy theory, nobody ever accuses Ukraine of having nukes. It doesn't make political sense. Russia wouldn't let them. The west would disown them. They had to decommission all their nukes before being allowed into the European economic system. I lay this down as my first point because it's indicative of the entire movie. This is trying to be a near future reality. It wants to be realistic. It's not. That gets annoying after awhile. Even with the food truck standoff, non of the combatants are taking cover. Everybody is standing out in the open and nobody is keeping an eye on the high ground. Once I realized that this is a dumb action movie, it does have its fun but the movie keeps thinking that it's smarter than it is. I love the Asimov conundrum being injected but it just reminds me that there is a smart script somewhere in here. It's smart one minute but gets dumb in the next. I also don't like the Gumps. Somebody would realize that it's useful for some Gumps to pack a bigger punch. They would at least have grenade launchers.",Outside the Wire

Captain Leo seems to be more forgiving but he is operating his own agenda.Outside the Wire aims to be a philosophical action movie. Leo and Harp debate about the rules of AI which is akin to Asimov's rules of robotics.There are some good action scenes and some good special effects. It is also incoherent, cliched with some terrible dialogue.",Outside the Wire
3,nogodnomasters,He's not like us,6,25 January 2021,"It is 2036. Lt. Harp (Damson Idris ) is a military drone pilot who works in an air conditioned trailer in Nevada drinking coffee and killing things. The Ukraine is still a hot spot with American forces there as peace keepers. They also have robot soldiers. During an attack Harp disobeys orders and does a drone strike to save a troop of men, but a couple die as collateral damage. As ""punishment"" he is sent to the same green zone where he works for Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie ). Leo is an android on a top secret mission to go after Viktor Kovel (Pilou Asbæk) who is on a path to getting the launch codes for Russian nukes that are still in the Ukraine, apparently not the ones that were dismantled or moved out.The plot moved along just fine and then decided it needed to get cute with an unneeded twist.

4,kosmasp,Entangled in the Wire(?),7,17 January 2021,"Or just ... plain wired? Now visually and technically in general I'd say there is not much one can critisize here. On the story part though ... or at least the coherent storytelling ... that's a different story (no pun intended). This really is quite a stretch to say the least. And while Mackie does his best to keep the audience engaged (together with the rest of the cast, but I'd argue he's best ... equipped - again with the puns I know) ... unfortunately I'd say he is ... programmed to fail! Ok I'll stop, but I just couldn't help myself.So if you want to just shut off and enjoy some action on your screen, you could do worse. But I hear many already saying ""why a 7? Why rate it so high?"". Well the answer to that is, that I was entertained and not bothered too much by the flaws the movie. I understand if you feel otherwise. This is far removed from a masterpiece ...",Outside the Wire

The movie pushes all the buttons, does everything that was in both genres of movies, but without any feeling. Ironically, it felt like a machine created the script - when I know for a fact that if a machine did it it would have been more creative.Bottom line: you may enjoy it, but it doesn't bring anything new and it's pretty boring.",Outside the Wire
7,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Imperfect but worthwhile futuristic yarn,7,3 February 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a futuristic war zone, with a soldier/robot army, a battle wages between insurgents and pro Russian forces, Lieutenant Thomas Harp (Damson Iris) disobeys a direct order, resulting in the deaths of some soldiers (but saving many others.) He is demoted down to a lower unit, to serve under the command of Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie), who has a human exterior, but is an android underneath. They are tasked with stopping warlord Victor Koval (Pilou Asbaek) who's purchased the codes to a nuclear arsenal. But the deeper he gets in to his mission, he learns everything is not as it seems.The theme of men and machines (and men versus machines, and vice versa) has been a constant theme for science fiction films since their conception, from The Terminator films to more recent fare like I, Robot, and a load of stuff before either. And it gets a fresh going over with this latest slick Netflix offering, a real above average but below exceptional effort that falls right in between.Opening, as it does, in the throes of a typically imperialist futuristic American war to destabilise democracy in a foreign land, it gives you a full visual assault of an all guns blazing war, with man and robot blasting away, but sadly at the expense of any great character development, leaving us indifferent to the central protagonist and his plight, or that of the charge he falls under. However, it compensates with a more intricate and multi layered plot than average, which holds your attention to the end.It's fair to say lead star Mackie has more than established himself as, if not quite a household name, one with enough star quality to carry his own movie, and this imperfect but worthwhile yarn is definitely another harmless notch on his belt. ***",Outside the Wire
8,Edvis-1997,6,6,17 January 2021,"So far the best movie of 2021 that I've seen(only saw 3 tho,lol). But for real, this movie was pretty interesting at the beginning and the middle looked decent but the ending, let's say it didn't happen. I also didn't like machines, they looked outdated(like from old movies),animation was average, acting was good. It had too many plot twists, some scenes didn't make a lot of sense.

10,851222,"Looked pretty good, but story was leading to nowhere",5,10 June 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Outside the Wire"" (2021) is a very disappointing movie. It had pretty cool concept and on paper i think it sounded way better, but the story overall is pretty lame and even kinda boring and did not lead to anything fresh or memorable.Action scenes were pretty descent. Acting was OK to say the best, and nothing more. But its the story were this movie suffered, because it was kinda boring to watch, and the dude who played with Anthony M. Has not much of charisma so it wasn't really involving to see his story either.Overall, ""Outside the Wire"" is not a terrible movie, and the execution of its action scenes is even pretty descent, but the story was not good.

11,The-Sarkologist,Mindless Action with Robots,6,21 April 2021,"The problem with Netflix is that you watch a really good film so you decide to watch another one and the quality of it drops dramatically, but then again I probably shouldn't be all that surprised considering that there does happen to be a lot of rubbish when it comes to films on Netflix. I guess they have to have a catalogue of some sort to keep people subscribed to it. Anyway, this certainly wasn't anywhere near as bad as some of them, but it wasn't particularly top quality either.This film is set in the future where the Ukraine has descended into civil war and the Americans have been deployed to act as peace keepers. The army has developed robots that provide support to the ground troops, and of course you have a group of drone pilots as well. During a pitched battle, what looks like a rocket launcher turns up and a drone pilot disobeys orders and blows it up, resulting in the death of two soldiers. As such he is made to actually go out on the ground so that he can experience what it is like to be a ground troop.Anyway, he teams up with an advanced robot and goes on a mission to hunt down a rebel leader who is trying to gain hold of some Russian nukes, but most of the film deals with him interacting with this advanced robot, as well as getting into some rather pitched battles with the rebels. At first he is part of a convoy, but after an ambush they head off on their own to attempt to prevent the nukes from falling into the hands of the rebels.I have to say that when I was younger I would have loved watching films like this, particularly with the pitched battles and all that - and there were quite a few. However, it just feels as if explosions and machine gunfights, for the sake of explosions and machine gun fights can simply become rather dull. Still, this film wasn't all that bad, though it certainly wasn't on par with some of the other films that I have watched. I guess in the end it is just one of those films that you watch when there is nothing else to watch, which these days doesn't really happen all that much, especially considering that you have access to so many films that it is unlikely that there will be a time when you don't have something else to watch.",Outside the Wire

13,cruise01,Decent action but forgettable story and flat direction,6,16 January 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over.,Outside the Wire

15,Vartiainen,Incoherent and emotionally distant plot brings the whole thing down,4,19 September 2021,"It's 2036 and US military has rolled out military robots to enforce their will across the globe, alongside more usual drones and human soldiers. Lt. Thomas Harp (Damson Idris), a drone pilot, gets assigned to assist Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie), a cutting edge android super soldier, for a covert behind the enemy lines type of mission.It's nice to see Anthony Mackie getting a leading role. He is a very good actor with great, understatedly commanding presence. And while Damson Idris isn't quite there yet in comparison he does a credible job acting opposite Mackie.Unfortunately the rest of the film is quite subpar. The film wants to examine what it means to be an android and how much humanity, morals and ethics they can possible possess. But the film actively hinders itself by not focusing on Mackie's character as much as they should. When the final scenes roll in, we have no idea why Leo does the things he does because we quite simply haven't gotten inside his head yet. Or really even started the process of getting in.Aside from that, the superficial plot about terrorists and bombs that serves as a vehicle for this ""androids, what are they up to?"" thing, doesn't wow us either. It's... there. Not all insurgents are bad, some US officers are needlessly bloodlusty. The usual.The film did have some nice action scenes and the acting could be good from time to time, but suffice to say, this is a film you can easily skip.",Outside the Wire

19,alindsay-al,A Below Average Action Film,4,15 January 2021,"Another year, another Netflix action film is here to watch, this time it is Outside The Wire and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drone pilot have to team up with android officer in an attempt to save the world.Main Character
Anthony Mackie plays Leo the android who I thought did a good job here and bought quite a bit to the role. He is basically the tough mentor and he does it pretty effectively, his character goes all over the place in the final act and it comes close to ruining it but it doesn't take away from his decent performance. But there is another main character Harp played by Damson Idris and I did not like this character at all. He does something at the beginning of the film that makes him unlikeable from the start and he never recovered for me and I never came around to care about him.Supporting Characters
The supporting cast don't offer anything because the film doesn't try to make that happen. The bad guy is as generic and dull as you can imagine and everybody else in the film is barely here and they aren't given anything to really work with. The film only really cares about its too main protagonists and forsakes every other character here.Story
The story is serviceable at best, I like the fact that Mackie's character was an android and how this world uses synthetics in general was pretty interesting and could have and should have been explored more. The film just doesn't do a good enough job of exploring it's themes and messages and the final act is so ridiculous and basically feels like it comes out of nowhere in order for the film to try and feel unique. Also the ending feels very abrupt, I don't know why lately it feels like films I watch are ending abruptly and this one is no different not answering all the questions it needs to.Script
The script is fine, Mackie spits out some pretty good dialogue and the story does have a few good elements. Though like its story the script falls very short and tries to be more interesting then it is and it could have done with either focusing more on the interesting parts or just be a full on action film.Style
The style of the film has some pretty decent action scenes that do show the horror of war. But the film doesn't do enough with what it has, probably because there wasn't the budget that the film really needed for something so ambitious.Overall
Overall, this is a below average action film that doesn't do anything to change up the game and really make it stand out and is one you can happily skip.",Outside the Wire

Sadly Outside The Wire is not in that category and is a big drop in Netflix Standards.In the near future, a drone pilot sent into a war zone finds himself paired up with a top-secret android officer on a mission to stop a nuclear attack.There is so much wrong with this film it's hard to know where to start .
Firstly they have put a great deal of trust in Damson Idris . It didn't work.
He looks about 14 years old so he's never convincing as a drone operator or a soldier and quite frankly he lacks personality.
Secondly it too over dependent on CGI . So much so that it feels like a computer games most of the time and that bored me to tears .The plus points are Anthony Mackie who I like and criminally underused Pilou Asbaek who plays Victor Koval and for some ridiculous reason is only in the film for five minutes .I Hope Netflix turn away from these overburdened CGI sci-fi movies because there aren't any good and this movie is a perfect example of that .",Outside the Wire
25,rgkarim,Action Outside the Norm For Streaming,7,15 January 2021,"LIKES:Moves well for most of the movie
Good Acting
Some Character Development In a war movie
Moralizing In a War Movie
Decent CGI
The Action At Times ExcitingDISLIKES:
Dialogue a Bit bland
Script A Bit Plain/Lack of Twists
Some Outside Logical Moments
The Lazy Writing with cursing
Involvement of Other characters are Okay
The Ending Loses Itself And Become Hastily FinishedSUMMARY:After a few opening titles to explain what is going on, Outside the Wire hits the ground with a literal bang as war opens up in a decent shoot out of military might. That pace keeps going for much of the movie, and takes little time to hit the brakes as Mackie and his partner jump into the complex Russian war frontier. Amidst the theater of war, these two soldiers manage to bring some character development into the typical solider war, gradually expanding on what goes on in their processors, while also integrating some personal morals that foreshadow what is to come. Certainly not as good as some other battle films, these two still have some more layered levels to their typical soldier titles. To help bring out all the feels of the moment, the two actors deserve props for bringing their skills to good levels, with Mackie taking charge of the front. Part Falcon meets part Triple 7 in regards to performances of the past, Mackie's stalwart stoic nature makes him perfect for the rugged soldier who is like no other. Meanwhile Cilenti acts a different route, a sort of analyzing compass who phases through the spectrum of emotions that serve as the medium to help give a little more to the action phase of the movie, aka morale investigation of war. Like many things in the modern era, Outside the Wire is not about entertaining, but having some political assessments baked into the movie in order to go with the modern audiences needs. Not as bad for most of the movie, the morals do a good job of showing the grey zone of war to make it engaging, relevant, and a particular plot point that again stays relevant for yours truly. This layered approach may help bring more people in and at least the first hour does not interrupt the action too much. In regards to the action, the movie has some very exciting moments, finally reaching the levels that movies in the theaters were able to achieve for me. Gun play, some close quarters combat, some engaging fights where you have no idea which good or bad people will make it are all this film. By far my favorite and perhaps strongest aspect of the film were these moments and though not the most dynamic or choreographed, many of the fights fit with the theme of the movie and keep things exciting amidst the more dialogue heavy moments, while also pushing the characters to new limits. CGI levels are not too bad either, with robots, stunts, and special effects nicely balanced to make a believable moment, without going into Michael Bay style levels of overdoing it.As for the dislikes, it starts with the dialogue of the film. Unlike some of the better war movies, Netflix did not invest a lot into the script balance for cleverness, motivational, or even emotional dialogue to be remembered. While the jargon fills at place, there are times that some more engaging words were needed to spice things up and make for memorable moments, especially during the character building moments. The same goes for the writing as the script gradually focuses more on the ethics of war, that the storytelling elements starts to be diluted as well. Lack of twists, some downgraded story elements, and many areas that start to lose logic and sense sadly take away from the potential build up that they wanted. In addition, the writing also gets lazy when the cursing comes into the fray, again losing the potential for some amazing writing instead of just crude commentary. The use of secondary characters is half decent as well, trying to incorporate several members of various factions into the mix to show the complexity of war. And yet, I still feel there was not a full engagement of some of these characters given all the profiling they did. The main leader of the revolutionary army, the military directors who have a beef with the characters, even the contact all felt kind of squashed in, involved at only segments of the movie rather than throughout making them feel sort of cheap. Again, better than many movies I've seen, Outside the Wire still had room to improve on all the characters being integrated and developed in this odd tale. Yet the biggest thing that takes away from me though is ironically the moral investigation at the end of the film. At one point balanced, by the end the movie decides to leap off the entertainment pathway and go more towards questioning the way of the world. Important? Absolutely, but at the same time the director dropped the ball for me as the tale's twist became much more of a philosophy text book then the engaging tale it started out as. An anti-climactic chase and fight at the end really showed this off, and though deeper than a typical action film, still held much more potential to be something greater if they had kept to the path they started that could have delivered both moral filled lessons and still been super engaging.The VERDICT:Overall, Outside the Wire fulfills the role of war quite well with a science fiction element that was not over the top or farfetched. Good acting for the leading roles helps with making characters you stick with along this fast paced adventure and potential resonating with to stay through the nearly two hours of material. With moral themes and thought of warfare integrated with exciting action in many parts of the film, the movie delivers the action/thriller promise the trailers made. Yet, the movie sadly needs some tuning up in the dialogue and writing to not only make more memorable moments, but execute the twists much better and not defy the logic they were building for. Some character integration and mitigating the morals in the end would have really made the movie much more complete and potentially finishing with the same balance of story and action I loved at the beginning. Still, overall, not a bad film for a streaming hit and thus my scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",Outside the Wire
26,mhorg2018,Does anyone at Netflix read a script before they approve it?,1,21 January 2021,"What do this, Mann and Machine, Yoyo and Holmes and Almost Human have in common? They're all failed attempts at having a human interact with a human looking Android. This film has so many plot holes, it must have been written on swiss cheese. First, if the US peacekeepers have these robots to use, why are there human boots on the ground? Second, the entire plot hole that gets the Lieutenant in trouble - killing two marines to save 38, is ridiculous. The marines never leave someone behind. This was a lame idea. Another huge problem - the Marines do not fly their own Drones. The Air Force does. Yes, its the future, but with the Marines getting rid of all their tanks recently, I simply can't believe that they'd have drones under their own command. Let's talk about the leads - at times it was hard to tell who was supposed to be the android, and who wasn't. They practically sleepwalk through their roles. The only thing I've seen on Netflix worse than this was The Midnight Sky, which was total crap. If Netflix has the money to greenlight 'original' films, they should hire someone to read the scripts before OKaying them. Just a horrible movie.",Outside the Wire

28,Abdulxoxo,Just another generic action flick that unnecessarily overcomplicates things,5,17 May 2021,"First of all Harp should feel lucky he even gets to be a part of this story; because for what he does in the opening scene I'd have expected him to be heading straight to jail. The fact he avoided that punishment was just the start of the frustrations with this film. It also doesn't help that from beginning to end he is such an unlikable lead character; and Idris brought no charisma whatsoever to the role. Speaking of unlikable characters our other co-lead, Leo, doesn't do any better at making me want to root for him. There's a similar lack of emotion which makes it really difficult to care about what happens to these guys. The fact Leo's part android makes him sort of cool - and the visual effects they use for his structure do look impressive - but it's not enough to make his character any more engaging that the annoying partner he was given. Aside from the generic nature of the villain and his plot, what didn't help this film was the amount of action sequences that just felt like watching somebody playing a computer game. This is a war film; or if you want to believe the writers you could say it's an anti-war film. I'm happy for there to be shoot outs and scenes where our protagonists are running around trying to avoid the explosions. However, narratively there should be a reason for these scenes to be taking place. The only reason for most of the action scenes in this film was to simply fill some time as Harp and Leo make their way from point A to point B. There were the odd decent fight sequences and moments of gore; but for the most part, with the lack of purpose or consequence, the action in this film (like its characters) was pretty dull. The film really only started getting into its stride in maybe the last 20-30 minutes; but with all the exposition and twists it gives us I'd almost lost all interest by this point.

31,IonicBreezeMachine,Servicable but unmemorable action thriller,6,16 January 2021,"In the year 2038, civil war has engulfed much of Eastern Europe and the US military, grown more reliant on drones and robot soldiers called Gumps, have established a peacekeeping force to maintain order in the region. Lt. Harp (Damson Idris), a U.S. drone pilot, is reassigned to one of the active combat sites after he disobeys orders and initiates a drone strike that saves a unit but only at the cost of two marines caught in the crossfire. Harp is assigned to captain Leo (Anthony Mackie) an advanced humanoid whose existence is heavily classified and near indistinguishable from regular humans. Leo enlists Harp to help him take down Krasny warlord Koval who's acquired nuclear weapons, but Harp soon finds out the mission may not be what he thinks it is.Outside the Wire is yet another action film by Netflix to try and deliver that ""summer blockbuster"" feel in the comfort of one's own home. Sometimes Netflix's attempts are quite good such as The Old Guard, but other times they can be so-so as seen with Bright and Project Power, or just dull and annoying as seen with Death Note and How it Ends. Outside the Wire hovers around okay thanks to a good cast and solid direction, but despite its technical craft it's rather lacking in impact.The movie mixes a lot of elements and feels like pieces of Ex Machina, Wargames, Eye in the Sky, and Green Zone mashed together. The movie tries to link the themes of dehumanized warfare with a reliance on drone strikes and trans humanist themes centered around Leo, but the two elements feel very disconnected because they never feel adequately explored. since Harp is a drone pilot who controls machines, and Leo is a machine built for war one would think that might make for fertile territory for character interaction, but strangely the movie never really does anything with that dynamic and the whole plot point of Leo being an android could be easily removed form the main plot. That's probably the movie's biggest weakness in that this is very much an action/war movie with only bare bones lip service given to the sci-fi aspect of its premise. The action is decent as well as the effects for Leo and the Gumps, and the acting is serviceable from both Mackie and Idris, but the script never conveys an emotional core that makes us invested in the proceedings. They try to give some emotional weight to Harp by giving him a fiancee (whom we never see except for a picture) but like the commentary on drones and AI it's given bare basics and could easily be removed.Outside the Wire is a very middle of the road movie, but it remains watchable thanks to decent performances, tight direction, and good effects. The screenplay however feels like a cut and paste job of other war/sci-fi films and it's lacking an emotional core to maintain investment. It's perfectly serviceable but it doesn't as an action film, but it won't be remembered long after finishing it.5.5/10 (rounded to 6)",Outside the Wire

35,abisio,Outside any logic or sense,4,19 January 2021,"Outside the Wire starts promising. Lt Harp; a drone pilot disobeys a direct order, shooting a missile and killing two soldiers in order to save the rest of the platoon. The guy is rebellious, self absorbed and cold; basically an ""I KNOW BETTER"".
After a court martial is assigned to the battle ground to Captain Leo; a very difficult official; who happens to be and android.
Leo takes Harp on a mission of searching terrorist warlord who is about to get launch codes for some Russian missiles. Interested ?; well that was the easy part.; what happens next is a completely mess.
There are lots of dialogs with very unclear explanations; some of them trying to be philosophical about the LAWS OF ROBOTIC, there is some hints of ""EDUCATION"" when Harps is completely afraid of being on the battlefield and find out that things are very different on the ground, and some political issues about who are really the good or the bad guys.
The problem is that the movie is never clear about were is going. There some good special effects; but most of the action is emotionless and not very interesting.
Leo motives to use Harp are overexplained but do not make any sense. The attitude of some people change from cold blooded killers to altruist. The final twist that could give the movie more interesting significance; is ruined by an over extended scenes with unnecessary dialog a politically correct resolution that basically dilutes the best thing of the movie.
In the acting department, Mackie is good as always, Damson Idris is almost unbearable; perhaps his character required that his empathy is nil .
Again, productions values are decent and special effects are good; but that does not make a good movie.
In brief; NETFLIX has done far better things in the past but lately seems to be targeting a no-thinking public. Do not lose your time",Outside the Wire
36,kuarinofu,"Starts good, dies fast (review from a Ukrainian)",5,15 January 2021,"Being a Ukrainian myself, this film felt just a little bit...weird.First of all, the choice of Ukraine as the place where the events unfold, given the current situation here, seems a little strange.Moreover, despite the fact that the story often mentions Russian mercenaries, everyone in the film speaks decent Ukrainian, it is not clear why this is so, since most Russians do not speak Ukrainian.They did a good job to create the entourage of Eastern Europe, but the locations clearly show that the filming was done in Hungary, despite the fact that the cast of the female British as the Ukrainian Sophia looks good, in the extras are too many people of non-Slavic appearance.There were other inaccuracies, I understand that it is not so fundamental for people who will not see the difference, just wanted to note these details.The movie itself started out quite interesting, but as time went on the first impression grew weaker and weaker.The plot began to twist too much and grow unnecessarily complicated, with time it became harder to understand what was going on and the motivations.By the end, the idea that was carried through the whole movie became more obvious, and the motivation of the main character became clearer, but I think it all could have been simplified.The action, for the most part, was well shot, although it wasn't always clear what was going on.Mackie did a great job, both delivering his performance and during the action scenes, it felt believable and he seemed quite deadly. Good job.The production was probably the weakest part of the film because during the battles there was no sense of a real military situation or even a local conflict. Some scenes looked too heavily staged, and the entourage of some locations was barely believable.I think the film had real potential, but at some point, something went wrong.
I didn't really like the fact that they used references to real locations and events.Overall, if all unnecessary elements were removed from the script, more interesting dialogues were added, and the viewer was forced to empathize with Mackie's character more, the idea of the film about the value of human life and the good in humanity would have worked much better.Ultimately, we just got a middling action movie, which is unlikely to be remembered by the audience.",Outside the Wire
37,SoumikBanerjee25,A fair to middling affair!,5,7 February 2021,"Other than its technical dexterity, ""Outside the Wire"" denudes all manner of concerns in its core foundation.

With the exception of conducive technicality, it doesn't quite emancipate on any other crucial facets!Anthony Mackie as Capt. Leo and Damson Idris as Lieutenant Harp. The shimmering chemistry they share might be the only affirmative edge of this whole equation! Moreover, portrayal of each individual taking part in here had so much room for further augmentation.Aforementioned issues emerge only because of a menial writing and that inebriated Screenplay; utterly discarding an abstruse potential underneath. Despite a necessitous offering, there are some noteworthy constituents.Action sequences are competently good enough with a few feisty hand to hand combats. Even though the special effects looked relatively cheaper but again not terrible by any means!

41,trinaboice,Not as terrible as everyone is saying,6,18 January 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Mikael Hafstrom, this Netflix original action flick has been receiving a lot of hate from reviewers. I actually liked it and think all of the critics are being overly harsh. We're all so spoiled by amazing special effects and sophisticated action sequences, so I agree that this movie isn't anything we haven't already seen a million times over, but I was still entertained. It blends war with science fiction, action, and drama. Netflix describes the movie as taking place in the near future, when a drone pilot sent into a war zone and finds himself paired with a top-secret android officer on a mission to stop a nuclear attack.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity and TONS of F-bombs
Lots of violence and destruction
High body count with tons of brutal deaths and bloody, dead bodiesTHEMES:
Trust
Humanity
American meddling abroad
The greater goodTHINGS I LIKED:
Anthony Mackie is absolutely fantastic, especially his stuntwork. There are some fun winks to his character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For example, he's sometimes called ""Cap"". He also says, ""I can do this all day"", which is a nod to Captain America in the MCU.
I actually know a guy who worked on an airbase in my area and controlled drones on the other side of the world. So, the aspect of the movie that takes a soldier in that kind of office environment into the frontlines was intriguing. I expected to feel the feels as he learned to value human life in a new way.
A few moments of humor in Act 1 to balance the almost non-stop action.
Speaking of action, some of the sequences and choreography are really great.
I love twists.
Some of the scenes were shot at the Kelenfold power station, a famous location that was also used for the Chernobyl Diaries.
Some of the special effects are really good. Others, not so much.
I liked the design of the droids and how they interacted with the world around them and with the humans.
I always like it when a movie title can be interpreted in several ways.
The trailer makes the movie look good.
The very first scene looked like something straight out of a video game and I wondered if the entire movie was going to be a game rip-off. The good news is that it's not.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The story is pretty ridiculous with a weak script.
It's extremely predictable.
The problem with making a movie that features two main characters who don't show emotion is that the audience also detaches on an emotional level and doesn't care whether or not those characters live or die.
What's the purpose of having a robot dog other than it looking cool? Haha
There is a lot of exposition.
It has been interesting to read all of the negative anti-American viewers who live outside the United States as it relates to the United States constantly meddling in affairs around the world.
There are some scenes where a soldier has a bunch of stuff in his teeth. Super distracting.
There is so much shooting and destruction that it becomes numbing.
We don't get a lot of character development in the story.
Some of the action scenes are choppy because of so many camera jumps and edits.
The inconsistent pacing makes the movie feel longer than it is.
The villains don't feel threatening enough.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Outside the Wire

Yeah sure it's not Oscar winning or anything outstanding, but it's a typical action film that ticks the boxes for said genre.It's a watchable plot with a pretty decent twist towards the end, which was nicely unexpected. The acting was okay as was the camera work etc. But yeah, I mean it's a pretty bog standard action film with guns, explosions and fighting. what more do you want with an action film?
The actual machines I thought played a minor part of the film and if like me you aren't keen on sci-fi you'll be fine. Of course this could reverse and if you like sci-fi you might be disappointed by the lack of it...Negatively I will say that the main character isn't exactly likeable and I wasn't too convinced on his characteristics. One minute he's scared, next he's brave then he isn't again. Make up your mind mate.Overall though it ain't bad. It's a plot that won't challenge you and if you like action just whack it on and see.

It's not boring, but it certainly is not memorable. A decent futuristic war film. Still, it has a basic script-related problem.. it's not interesting.-Main character (not Anthony Mackie) is the worst part of it. From the beginning, I lost interest in him. After a while you start asking yourself what Damson's role is. He is neither interesting or as charismatic as his partner is written as. Contrast perhaps?
Still, he wasn't given a personality, but instead, dislikeable traits that aren't corrected. The way he is proud yet dumb, and continues to disrespect and challenge everything.. it lost me. Characters (even with faults, which are the best kind of characters) with no motivation are not good characters.
As the ending is weak, in my opinion, I think this movie felt apart from the start but you realize it way too late.Beyond that.. it consistently has varying levels of audio quality (room echo at one point, no ""feedback"" the next line, making some lines sound synthetic and out of place), and noticeable ADR : laughs, lines while actors aren't facing the camera, and even lines when they are and their mouths aren't moving. For such a ""good looking"" piece of cinema, this is atrocious. It's like bad CGI in the sound department.-Wouldn't recommend it.

51,coreyjdenford,Narrowly threaded wire,6,15 January 2021,"Outside The Wire, is a title that's been used numerous times, well, maybe not those exact words but it's a fundamental thriller title at this point - by perhaps meaning that something, somewhere is going to happen. Plus it's always a guaranteed thriller title too. It's that time again for a Netflix thriller, like with The Old Guard, Extraction and Project Power before, Outside The Wire is yet another one of those so so thrillers that's good action set pieces, and yes, they are good, but not really much else. And much like those as well they also want to prove that a lot of people won't pay attention. It's not a bad film, it's not great either, it's on par with the former. Plus it's set in the future as well, so you could add sci-fi to that, in 2036 there's a war between America and Russia, and a drone pilot is teamed with a super intelligent biotech android to figure out why there is a war. That's pretty much it, the rest is a nonsensical action romp that's well done in the fast paced action set pieces, and naught to do with story. And much like the three aforementioned films, it toys around with big ideas and Anthony Mackie's solid performance just makes it enough for viewers to keep watching, and remember nothing of what happened.

They could've just removed the idea of Anthony Mackie being a robot and it wouldn't have changed anything. I have no clue why they went in this direction, maybe it makes the character cooler? Or maybe the movie cooler? It's just really poorly written and directed.Outside the Wire is one of the first movies by Netflix in 2021,which is quite worrisome.

Director: Mikael Hafstrom
Starring: Anthony Mackie, Damson Idris, Enzo Cilenti, Emily Beecham, Michael Kelly, Kristina Tonteri Young etcOverall rating 29/100Outside the wire is a movie about a disgraced drone pilot who is sent into a civil warzone and is paired with a top-secret android officer on a mission to stop a nuclear attack that could kill millions. Outside the wire was entertaining enough for the most part but for me was an absolute mess and slowly got worse and worse as the movie developed, so let's get started.Lets be nice and start with some positives shall we, the movie had an interesting plot and creative plot points as well as some very entertaining and well-choreographed action sequences. The movies premise was interesting and started off really well. They established the story world and the futuristic elements really well, establishing an interesting balance between action and sci fi that for the most part worked, with some creative and fun plot points to do with the androids helping soldiers on the front line and Anthony Mackie's character. The action sequences were also great, these were definitely some of the best parts of the movie, they were fun and entertaining and kept you on the edge of your seat, so if you didn't think about the actual characters or structure etc it was a fun and enjoyable movie.However, let's get started on some negatives. There was some rushed background to the plot, some bad editing within the action sequences, some bad character decisions and a very dislikeable main character. The movie had barely any background to its plot and just expected the audience to just know what was going on between all the different characters, it was a rushed and confusing way to begin the movie and it just felt lazily written. I also thought the editing with a lot of the action sequences was pretty poor, they used way too many fast jump cuts, it was confusing and disorientating to watch and I didn't really know what was going on, most action scenes have jump cuts but not as erratic as this movie. I also thought that there were some terrible character decisions that made the main character incredibly unlikeable, some of his decisions were just unforgiveable and just not right, which made the main character just a nasty person, he didn't really have any likeable qualities to him and unfortunately the performance from Damson Idris was just mediocre, so this caused a disconnect with the movie for me.My final few positives would be the cinematography, main performance, and effective use of gore. The movie looked visually fantastic, with beautiful set locations and impressive CGI for Anthony Mackie, it made you invested in the story world and was often a good distraction from the movie's weaknesses. I also thought the main performance from Anthony Mackie. He was funny and charming and also showed his more serious side as well and stole every scene he was in and often held the film together. I also thought that there were some very effective uses of gore, it really made the action sequences more impactful and fun to watch and I am glad the movie decided to be rated R/15.My next few negatives would be that the movie was overstuffed with characters, it had a bland and corny script and loads of pacing inconsistencies. The movie just had way too many characters, there was multiple different groups who wanted different things and it was never clear throughout the whole movie who you were supposed to support, it made the movie lack focus and was a mess. The movies script was also just very bland and generic, they had opportunities to go deeper with the plot and charcters but they just went for a generic action movie instead, with corny lines that didn't land and poorly thought out humour that for the most part just didn't connect despite Anthony Mackie really trying. The movie just had loads of pacing inconsistencies as well, There was a strange blending of really rushed scenes that didn't get any development or background, or scenes that dragged out for way too long, they were too inconsistent and it just made the movie messy and clunky.My final few negatives would be the lack of character development or background as well as an oddly structured plot and an awful final act. The movie lacked any form of background to any of its characters, they were all just very one dimensional and I didn't connect with any of them, there was plenty of opportunities for character depth that just weren't taken. I also thought the movie had an oddly structured plot. It felt to me as if the movie just had a first act and then a really long and drawn out final act. The movie felt like it ended when it still had a lot of the plot left and this made the pacing and narrative really clunky and it showed the weakness in the writing. Finally, the final act in general was an absolute mess. It felt like they had about four different endings that they kept in the same movie, they changed the antagonists and protagonists so much I didn't know who to support and to be honest I stopped caring.Overall, Outside the Wire is entertaining enough, with a great performance from Anthony Mackie. But apart from that the movie is an absolute mess with a poorly constructed plot and characters, with the movie just getting worse and worse the more you watch.",Outside the Wire

57,ExpendableMan,"""Who programmed you to swear so much?""",6,16 January 2021,"'Outside The Wire' is the first major straight-to-Netflix release of 2021 and it's a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a rollicking action movie with some brutal fight scenes, two likeable leads and enough fisticuffs to please adrenaline junkies. On the other, it's unable to decide whether it's anti-war or not. It treads a thin line between bullet-riddled Michael Bay set-pieces and ""ooooh, the horrors of war"" morality and doesn't quite reconcile the two. It is however notable for being one of those rare occasions where Hollywood ventures into a fictional war in the future. Aside from 'Starship Troopers' and 'Enemy Mine,' there's not a whole lot of those, most military films tend to be set in the middle of real events.The film sees Lieutenant Harp (Damson Idris), a disgraced drone pilot with no ground-level combat experience assigned to a demilitarised zone in Eastern Europe. There, he's teamed up with Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie), a highly advanced cybernetic super-soldier and sent on a mission outside the US-controlled area controlled (hence - ""outside the wire""). They're theoretically being sent to deliver vaccines to the civilian populace, but things soon escalate and the bewildered Harp finds himself in the middle of a high-stakes mission to stop a warlord getting hold of nuclear weapons.The film gets a lot of things wrong. The sight of Harp casually munching on Gummi Bears while piloting a drone through a combat mission is especially troubling, given that it's well-established that drone pilots experience PTSD as much as any other soldier. The claim he has 55,000 hours flying experience is ludicrous and Mackie's cyborg character is so preposterously advanced, it's like he's been beamed back in time from a thousand years in the future. Especially when you compare him to the clanking robotic grunts that populate the rest of the warzone.
It's also too long and could have probably had ten minutes or so edited out.However, it gets a lot right too. The action choreography is top notch and seeing Mackie tearing his way through militants is never not entertaining. Damson Idris puts in a convincing and likeable turn, while Emily Beecham is great as a rebel leader who is far more ruthless than she first appears. Game Of Thrones star Pilou Asbaek has a brilliantly over-dramatic entrance for his cameo too. There's a lot to like in 'Outside The Wire,' not enough to excuse the faults but enough for it to be a cautious recommendation.Not spectacular, but a long way from terrible then. 'Outside The Wire' raises questions about the nature of technology-led warfare, but isn't always convincing in its intent. The moral ramifications of drone strikes is there, but it's sat alongside the headbanging awesomeness of Anthony Mackie shooting robots with a grenade launcher and impaling people on flag poles. It's way better than films like 'Chappie' though and far superior to 'Spectral,' the last Netflix future-war film to poke its head above the parapet.",Outside the Wire

Anthony Mackie is a very good actor and possesses a screen presence.
Several of the action scenes are engaging.Cons:
Everything else
Protagonist acting is way off. It is the Kneau Reeves/Kristen Stewart off.
Writing is a step beyond high school, with dialogue that is laughable.
Logic is nonsensical, where people walking and people driving a car very fast are reaching the same destination at the same time(and they both left the same time).
Plot is early James Bond level of over the top.
Editing is patched together so loosely that you barely realize what is going on

Harp represents the authority of the government and the true believers of the same. Capt Leo represents the questioning or rebellion of authority of government. Harp is portrayed as out of touch with the people and the reality ""on the ground"" and Leo is seen as in touch with the people and for the people. The big scene sees Harp realize his error in believing in the government and the cliché that you must have in any robot based movie of the bad robot/technology turn on its creator. The entire shore is about ""bad/evil government vs oppressed people"".

It's scored and edited well, and the pacing is generally fine, although the runtime exceeds the material by about 15 minutes.But, oh dear, that material.All that money on CGI and extras and they couldn't spring for a military advisor. No rank insignia, NCOs barking orders at commissioned officers, officers apologising to privates, salutes that aren't held until acknowledgement. Why get things so wrong, when it's so easy to get them right?They didn't even have the budget for a calculator, because by my numbers, ""56,000 flight hours"" equates to over 6 years at 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Whomever wrote that line needs to never work again. Apparently they didn't even have a map, because they think that Ukraine is a Balkan state. Is Panama part of the United States?Then we get to the directing and acting, which is on a par with the script. Anthony Mackie has some screen presence and acting range, but Damson Idris is generic, erratic, often seems uncertain what he's meant to be portraying, and delivers some reads worthy of Scooby Doo. The Balkranian extras generally do a better job, and Emily Beecham acts them off the screen. Curious that they'd have her do an English accent but force her to Americanise the pronunciation of ""loo-tenant"" though.There's a plot, of sorts, but it doesn't really matter.

It's not understandable the reason why the soldier enters the compound facing the strong menace lonely, as well as, the necessity and the aim to enter the compound when all is controlled by remote location such as the possibility to neutralize the menace easily (just to justify the appreciation to the lonely soldier he receives from captain in the final scene). Totally dumbness. An excellent idea compromised by cretin plot and development as well. The story doesn't explain the reason why the two contenders were in affair, the reason of their real objective and the reason why the one attack the other one.

He's one of those actors with a base set of skills and you like them or you don't. He's okay in this role. The other male lead, Idris, was terrible.

Or more correctly weren't even needed. By the middle of the movie it was getting boring.PACING. It started well and there were some good action scenes but they didn't move the storyline along. There was a whole confrontation at a destroyed aid truck that was just filler. The ending was just slow and you wanted it to be over. The actual ending of Idris walking into the camera was just dull and pointless. You kept waiting for something to happen as you thought, this can't be the ending.SETTTING. It is getting harder to give credit to settings as so much is CGI now but this did have the feel of being filmed in Europe and it says it was on IMDB. That gives a few parts a different feel.DUMB THINGS. There were lots of them.
*There really is no good rationale for Harp to be assigned as he was. There is no link between his training or really his personality.*There is the foolish countdown. Haven't directors watched Team America? ""Now America will be destroyed. In 5 minutes."" Even puppets know what is a bad plot device.*There is the equally foolish, let's talk to the last minute and then with seconds left, I will race out of the building to get away from a major explosion.*Putting a failsafe in a machine but so close to the surface that someone with NO training could remove it.*Harp was disrespectful almost in every interaction.

P. A. And the military are currently working on. This film gives a realistic (in my opinion) depiction of what they would be like in real-time battle. Not these super-fast god monsters of metal but a man-mad object that can be destroyed easily enough. Personally, I don't get the design. Why have a robot that looks like a human and has to point its gun like a human. Surely a design can be made where the guns already pointing there. I.e. It'll have many guns. And 2 legs as a major mode of transportation is just a major design flaw in humans in battle -- The more multi-functional limbs the better.Mackie's performance is perfectly adequate, nothing special.

The protagonist (played by Damson Idris) overall performance is weak, it's a combination of his mediocre acting skills and the uneven character display between different scenes (cool and calm in one, a silly-billy in the next). Also they made his rank a lieutenant. If you ever been in the army you'll know that it takes a strong character to become a lieutenant, it is apparent that none of the writers/directors ever served in the military.In between the explosions and bad CGI we are forced to listen to constant bickering between Damon's character and Anthony Mackie who plays the other main character in the movie. The dialogue is silly, some might laugh at it but in general it does not add anything to this movie and it can become annoying at times. The action parts are ok, but nothing you haven't seen before.

There has very obviously been no research done into things such as claimed flight hours logged and geography. It's details such as these that constantly undermine the efforts of the cast to sell the story and frankly those efforts weren't very good anyway. I always had the impression the movie was made to a timescale rather than a standard.Some of the effects are ok but that's about it for positives. The underlying theme of America as the world's saviour has worn thinner than the Emperor's new clothes and I'm not buying it any more. All this does is add cheese to a poor recipe.

Not to cut casualties, but to make the fighting 'more efficient'. Who doesn't want a robot that never sleeps and kills without hesitation?
The ultimate goal of 'The Bad Guy' is to make humanity question its use of robots in war, and maybe not do it anymore? But of course the humans win, how could they not? This is a film made by humans.
Liberally dosed with some outstanding shootee action, many life or death situations, and several twists to keep you guessing, this was like an ethics lecture performed via a PS4 session playing 'Modern Warfare'.

127,MackMonMay87,For Anthony Mackie Fans Only; He Proves He'll be a Great Captain America,5,14 March 2021,"Outside the Wire is a movie I only watched out of pandemic boredom. It's got a dull, washed out color palette, and that kind of sums up how you'll feel about the movie for the most part also.I'm a huge fan of the MCU and of Anthony Mackie, and he's literally the only reason to watch this. if you're not a fan of either of those things, and don't need some Mackie-action to tide you over until Falcon and the Winter Soldier comes out, you can skip this movie entirely.The heavy-handed message of the lives of the few vs many, the critique of drone warfare, and the use of ever-advancing technology and endless war are dealt in a very hammy, over-the-top manner that's obvious, possessing zero subtlety at all.It's either the script that fails him or his lack of screen presence, but Damson Idris, who plays alongside Mackie here, is not that enjoyable as the main character. There's moments where he almost seems interesting, then the script peels away from delving into it. His character is annoying, unconvincingly competent out of convenience in the third act, and at times absurdly naieve. Like when he grins and keeps saying ""it's going to be okay"" during a hostage situation in the middle of a war with enemy combatants, when any moron could tell that combat is about to pop off. Ridiculous.
His character goes from being a callous, hardened drone pilot to a compassionate warrior in no time flat, with very little character development in a convincing way, and the movie never really gives credence and consequence to the fact that he kills two soldiers as a drone pilot, disobeying orders. They should've made him *almost* kill the two pilots and then get the assignment as a final warning. The military would court marshal and jail any soldier who did something like that immediately, and in terms of film-making, it's a poor way to establish a lead character. He's just plain unlikeable, and Idris doesn't find enough to make him likable or charismatic, and Mackie easily and quickly overshadows him.The CGI is decent, some of the camerawork isn't bad, and Mackie really does shine in the action scenes. It's a step above the straight-to-streaming movies actors like Seagal, Bruce Willis, and others are doing (many of which are also often set in Eastern Europe as it's cheap to film there), but there's still an overall cheapness to it, and Mackie can't salvage everything.
The best thing it does is show that he's more than suited to be the next Captain America, and the close quarters techniques he uses in some of the shootouts are legitimately interesting and belong in a better production.The ending is also awful, Mackie's character only fails because he simply decides not to kill Idris, with no reason why he shouldn't. He's been established as a cold, ruthless machine, dedicated to his task and efficient. For some reason, he just decides not kill Harp.
Outside the Wire will be forgotten and overshadowed by better projects from Mackie in the future, and hopefully everyone else involved. But if you're bored and stuck at home until you get vaccinated, you could do worse.",Outside the Wire

It's not just a cheap thrill, bare bones shoot-em-up peppered with some flashy explosions. It has quiet a few twists and turns, it's also a musing about the evolution of war, the next longbow. It captures the shift in zeitgeist on AI; new notions of what it might be, how it would act.
Needles to say the acting, the script, the visuals, the score are all up to par. This movie stand on two feet. As an added bonus I was happy to see while the credits rolled, that Netflix and it's contracted studios employ so much hungarians, YAY for international entertainment industry.
The movie's weakness, I would say, is it's complexity. There are multiple themes presented, multiple emotions and thoughts invoked without any of them given the requiesite time or build up to take center stage. That may be the perfect recipe for a thought-provoking drama that's meant to leave you wonder way after the movie has ended, but as far as I'm concerned, it just doesn't work well in the action genre.
But then again I might just be old fashioned; I grew up watching '80s and '90s action flics. Now those were one-track stories.

146,guyzradio,If HAL9000 and Robocop had a love child.... (** Spoilers **),6,26 January 2021,"There are a lot of action flicks that are clearly turned out with the same cookie cutter. In ""Outside the Wire"", the future military has embraced AI technology and created ""GUMPS"" -- robotic soldiers who fight alongside human troops. They also have Captain Leo, a cyborg made to look and act like a human, with emotions, physical sensations, superhuman strength, and as we eventually see, a conscience.""Outside the Wire"" was a bit difficult to follow at times. There is not much character development except for Lt. Harp and Capt. Leo. Movie contains liberal helpings of violence and language. Some elements, such as the ""GUMPS"", are interesting, but treated as window dressing.Overall, I found the movie to be ""mindless entertainment"" (expect little; avoid disappointment) up to the end, when the actual message was revealed, and that is that Leo planned to nuke the USA all along in order to discourage the creation any more cyborgs like himself. The point of the movie distills town to the question whether AI can be so well crafted so as to transcend the wisdom of its creators, and in such cases, what constitutes the ""high road."" Often, movies where AI has gone amuck cast AI as evil. In this case, Leo deems the existence of his kind as bad because of what it can lead to, and by his own logic, attempts to do the greater good despite the ""collateral"". As usual, the victor writes the history book.",Outside the Wire

The cast is less then engaging and it permeates throughout the movie - therefore a story that's not meant to drag ends up doing just that. Not the worst movie I've ever seen in this genre by any means but it definitely needed help - it needed some better casting because Mackie can't be the only one carrying the film as good as he is.

I kinda feel sorry for Anthony Mackie, he seems like a stand-up guy. Altered Carbon was a huge dud, and now this, I hope Falcon & The Winter Soldier does his career some good because I'm starting to lose faith in the guy.This movie was actually putting me to sleep. I was trying to stay awake, but the movie was so boring I couldn't keep my eyes open (this isn't a joke, it actually put me to sleep on several occasions, I kept having to rewind it to see what I missed). The movie was marketed as this bombastic action film, but the first fight scene we see with the android (Anthony Mackie) takes place more than 45 minutes into the film.There's not much to say about this film, from a writing perspective it's just boring, lazy and not entertaining. I guess if you're a diehard action fan there may be something here for you - there's a decent number of 'things' happening, but none of it is interesting or compelling.There's one really bad expository scene that's so jarringly blatant it completely took me out of the film for a moment. It's something like this:This is not actual dialogue (although it may as well should be), just an example of how bad it was.GUY 1: We need uranium from the place.GUY 2: Ah, that place was ruled by those people.GUY 1: Yes, but those people died, now it's owned by these people.GUY 2: Ah, those people are evil because of the event 3 years ago.GUY 1: Yes, 3 years ago the event shook the world & now we have machines.Who talks like this??? Oh, and the whole time they're doing this exposition scene Anthony Mackie keeps walking around with his arms crossed... The whole scene is weird and poorly written.TLDR; The movies a dud. However, depending on your tastes, I guess any score between a 1 and a 6 can be trusted as coming from an objective reviewer. That's being lenient btw, a 6 in reality is far too high, but I'm accounting for the action junkies.

The theme of the movie was a little all over the place. Idris' character would exhibit strange personality shifts at the drop of a hat, behaving as a cold and reserved soldier, then suddenly talking like a kid, then back to cold and reserved.
Also, the stereotypical ""military"" depiction in movies like these has got to end. It's always so very clear that the writers/director have no understanding of what the military is actually like beyond tropey 80s movies. It's not getting old anymore, it's six feet under. The story looked like it might show some potential initially, although some of the character behavior was very unrealistic and cliche, but I was hoping it would change. It didn't. It was paint-by-numbers predictability to an annoying degree.
That said, action direction is competent, as is the cinematography (nothing special, but not bad by any stretch).

216,westerfieldreviews,"Robots & Bullets & War, Oh My!",3,7 February 2021,"Mikael Håfström returns to the director's chair bringing life to a less than subpar action film that does nothing interesting with the genre it tackles or its own promising material. Outside the Wire is a muddy adventure from start to finish that will either have you bored out of your mind or laughing at how absurd and goofy all of it is. Sadly, Rob Yescombe presents a story that wants to address fascinating concepts and subject matter, but due to terrible world building, bad dialogue, and a paper-thin plot, all of it is squandered. Characters have nothing worthwhile to say so good talent from the likes of Damson Idris, Anthony Mackie, and Michael Kelly are all wasted to the point where not even Mackie's on-screen charisma can pull this dump from the fire. But, many action films with a lack of writing quality and character development can still pass as worth watching for those who wish to sit back and mindlessly watch dumb fun. Yet, not even Outside the Wire can deliver on that front as the action is some of the blandest work I have seen in a long while. Breakneck editing that cuts every half second and shootouts that are completely redundant combine to generate action set pieces that feel unimaginative and stale. From a poorly written script to paper-thin characters and a lack of fun action, everything about Outside the Wire feels like a film that was made for the sake of it.Outside the Wire is set in the year 2036 during a civil war centered around Russian forces that are seeking to take Ukraine over by any means necessary. A local resistance force holds the line as U.S. troops stationed in a demilitarized zone between both countries does their best to keep the peace. We pick up with UAV drone pilot lieutenant Harp (Damson Idris) who is surveying an active battleground where a platoon of soldiers are pinned down. Seeing an incoming threat, Harp disobeys a direct order killing a pair of soldiers in the process. For his actions, Harp is punished and sent to the DMZ (demilitarized zone) where he is to meet with and train under an advanced new-age android super-soldier named Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie). Once there, Leo explains to Harp all about the current affairs of the war detailing a plan to capture and put an end to terrorist leader, Victor Koval (Pilou Asbæk) and his nuclear plan. After their first encounter, Harp learns of Leo's true inception and the two embark on their mission to save the world from a nuclear war. Along the way, Harp and Leo grow a bond together that sees Leo twist the truth every step of the way until it is too late. Now with a rogue android on the loose, it is up to Harp to track him down and ensure the safety of the globe.Rob Yescombe and Rowan Athale work together to pen the original screenplay for the film, but the story is a creation from the mind of Yescombe himself. From a base starting position, Yescombe does a good job of creating a universe with an assortment of interesting dynamics that range from civil wars, to combat machines, and even nuclear warfare. Yet somehow, the film does everything it possibly can to make none of these elements interesting. Near the very beginning of the film just after Harp and Leo meet for the first time, Leo runs through the brief history of the conflict in one of the laziest exposition dumps I have ever seen. Leo explains that our terrorist leader Koval is a ""bad guy"" who will commit ""bad things"", but we never get the opportunity to see any of it. Without having a basis for understanding what Koval will do and the lengths to which he will go to achieve his goal, there are no stakes invested in what possibly could happen. Random computer files and newspaper clippings are all we get when it comes to explaining character motivation and a reasoning behind how a civil war erupted in Northern Europe. On top of that, with an action film set in the not so distant future of 2036, war machines are bound to be present. However, throughout the entire film's nearly two-hour runtime, all we get to see are two different types of robot soldiers and a few junkers sprinkled in a single scene. No fun self-driving or self-piloting vehicles, no weaponized drones, and no soldier variants with unique abilities; just a collective of things we have already seen. All of it winds up feeling like a collective of generic ""near future"" tech that could be found in almost any other sci-fi film that holds the same visual aesthetics which we have all seen before. Sadly, it means that although some fascinating items are present within the world Yescombe created for Outside the Wire, all of it is wasted on a fantasy universe that feels dull.Outside the Wire not only squanders its interesting world, but it also fails at conveying an engaging story on any level. At the outset, we are introduced to Idris' character Harp who is a disconnected lieutenant that believes in making the necessary sacrifices for the greater good. And if you were looking for any further character development you will not find it here. Over the course of the film, Harp is challenged and forced to step out of his comfort zone but he virtually remains the same person only slighting changing and growing until eventually gaining an appreciation for the fieldwork of his fellow soldiers. His morals are questioned but throughout the film, he steadily remains an unlikeable character whose insufferable ego only inflates after becoming the hero of his own story. Opposite Idris is Mackie who plays advanced android Captain Leo. Thanks mostly in part to Mackie's performance, Leo is a character full of life that clearly is meant to be the inverse of Harp and as the film progresses, you can tell that the writers wanted to toy with the ideas of humanity and the cost of life. Yet, it never fully commits to bringing forth an intriguing take that will have your mind questioning those very ideas. Instead, the film brings these points up in small conversations, then moves on never addressing them again to the point where it feels like a checklist of talking points is being consulted all of the time. The sad truth of the matter is that everything Outside the Wire tries to do and say, a dozen of other films have already said and done those things to a much higher level.What makes Outside the Wire as disappointing as it is, stems not from it just being flat out horrible because if that were true you could clean your hands of the film and forget about it. No, what makes it such a let down is that there are genuinely some interesting concepts and ideas found within the story, it just never manages to develop them in any meaningful way. Håfström's work behind the camera is nothing special as action scenes are both choppy and boring blurring your focus the entire time, Yescombe and Athale do hardly anything original with the world they set up, and performers across the board are wasted on a less than stellar script. As far as uninspired action movies go, it is par for the course with cheesy to outright bad dialogue, characters that get zero development, and a paper-thin plot that breaks the moment you think about the coincidental circumstances. Yet somehow, the backdrop of a fascinating world that gets no treatment makes Outside the Wire somehow feel even worse.Final Verdict: D-",Outside the Wire

And those last scenes were so cringy and filled with unnecessary (and very frustrating) attempts at creating suspense/tension.I actually liked the plot twists regarding the cyborg Leo's character. If only he had a better supporting actor. There should have been some consequences in the end of the movie, the finale just fell a bit flat.And this movie is way too long and somehow I t felt unfinished.

224,Yarayaraman,A mess,4,17 January 2021,"Borrowing ideas from lots of films such as Training Day, The Terminator and Universal Soldier to name but a few, it fails to put any of them together in a meaningful way, leaving an incoherent mess. It could have been made in the eighties, and with the latest special effects could have brought something new, but lacks any of the reckless abandon or humour of that era.Despite its relatively long running time, the pace of the film keeps things moving. So, while you're unlikely to be convinced or even clear about the jumbled up morality lessons, it it is relatively engaging throughout.The acting is fine. The action is ok. The script is lazy, but not ridiculous. But despite the main character being a very human-like Android, with ""more emotion than any human"" it lacks heart or purpose. It doesn't present itself as a switch your mind off action film, but also fails to delivery a message.All of the characters are so underdeveloped and clichéd to the point that it is difficult to care about them, or the outcome.There are obvious and silly moments throughout, such as running away from exploding buildings just in time and supposedly tense moments where you can see what's going to happen a mile away, if you even care. The plot twists aren't that surprising, if you haven't guessed them already, and the done much better in other films attempts to unpack the advances in technology and AI on the battlefield, it lacks any weight.Given how many great films are out there, it is not terrible, it just really isn't worth your time.",Outside the Wire

241,revboose-781-838014,Frankenstein for 2021,7,16 January 2021,"Anthony Mackie gets to take a nice dig / callback at his upcoming run as the new Captain America when he gets to ask his young protege what a ""super soldier"" should look like - tall, ripped, blond hair, blue eyes (in other words, like Chris Evans!). He gets called ""Cap"" throughout the film by this sidekick, which is interesting because Mackie's character, as mechanical as he is, swears like a truck driver, an interesting counter to the holy-gee-whiz puritanical good-guy that Evans was throughout the MCU's last decade.The story is serviceable - predictable on one hand, in that you see a lot of things you have seen before, but with enough twists to keep you guessing until near the end. Damson Idris, as hotshot drone pilot demoted to grunt Lt. Harp, needs a little more polish, and he's not really believable as a pilot-turned-commando as the story reaches its climax.The story starts to come apart as we get into the third act, though, and as we start to confront the question first raised in the Frankenstein novel and repeated elsewhere countless times but most memorably in Jurassic Park, when Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) growls, ""You were so fixated on the fact that you *could* do it that you never asked yourselves whether you *should* do it!"" What I did appreciate was that this was not a movie where the director or scriptwriter suddenly said, ""Oh, crap, I need an ending!"" - the ending perfectly follows the stream of events set up from the moment Harp gets called before the Review Board. It's a movie that I've seen once, may watch again for nuances I may have missed, and then never have to watch again.7/10",Outside the Wire

While the plot specifically said at the very beginning that nowhere is safe once they are outside the military base.Anthony finally got to play as Captain America in this movie, who is able to take down teams of elite soldiers single handedly in some cool gun fights, but at the end is not able to take down a rookie soldier.Other than the very bizarre sharp change of the protagonists' performance in this film which makes the plot laughable, it's an entertaining movie.",Outside the Wire

The action scenes are excellent and you can suspend enough belief to enjoy them.
The use of robots is well done and mostly believable.
Excellent twists and turns.
Bad: The story is all over the place not very convincing in parts and down right stupid in many places. Too many plot holes and story inconsistencies.
Personal issue was using vehicles only sold in Nth America pretending is in Eastern Europe 15 years from now.
Much of the portrayal of Eastern Europe felt done by someone who has not been to that part of the world.
Some scenes look like B grade TV end of the world stuff.
Also driving said POS through the Ukraine in middle of a war and catching up with guy that has a better vehicle and half a days start.In the end the acting and action scenes make it good enough to ignore the dumb parts, mostly. With better story telling and some more $ it might have been excellent.

The plot is lost from the beginning, and it becomes a series of jumpcuts and stereotypical action shots. I turned off my expectations going into this movie but holy cow it's bad.The bad guys all drive American cars. The military all drive cars. Except for the 2 MRAPS and an armored robot carrier, I honestly believe the US Marine Corps in this universe has moved to buying Toyota SVU's as tactical transportation. The guns are rediculous, with many characters firing four shots and switching to their pistols that apparently have infinite ammo. I will say the robots are cool so I'll give them that.The plot, oh god the plot sucks. The big reveal that one of the main characters is a robot is ok, it's done in the first 15 minutes, so not a spoiler. The main character/robot guy just is annoying with his vague orders and broad everything. The other guy (The Lieutenant) is whiny and questions everything and all around is a terribly written character. The movie inserts the trope of the weakest link becoming a certified in the last 20 minutes of the movie, it doesn't work. He's still whiny and he's still incompetent. Honestly worst part of the movie has to be him.I highly don't recommend anyone with military experience watch this movie as they will probably become enraged and sad at the same time.

Utterly nonsensical from start to finish, there's absolutely no way the screen writer was sober at any point in this production.

Was good to see Anthony Mackie up front and center again.You wont have any idea what the endgame is until 3/4 of the way through the movie. The bigger issue it addresses is real-time on both AI and our hubris in thinking that we can control its evolution. It calls to light our humanity and the ills that we do coming back at us. Also, the aspect of war from the comfort of home with this generation and its love for video games and how that translates to the removal from the real life consequences of pressing a button thousands of miles away first pulling a trigger with boots on the ground in combat is yet another real-time issue.I would have given it a ten but the ending did fall short of the build up.

327,tilmanowl,The robots were bad,3,20 January 2021,"Look, it's difficult for ""sci-fi"" to be wrong, but this movie somehow does it by contradicting itself frequently. More specifically, it makes the classic amateur sci-fi/fantasy blunder where someone (a scriptwriter presumably) says, ""We want X technology to be in the story"" but then doesn't consider the wider consequences of including that element in their story. For example, in a magic setting it's like giving wizards the ability to shoot fire but somehow nobody realizes they can use their magic to also cook food, heat homes, or do anything other than fight with. Similarly, the scriptwriters seemingly said ""we want an indistinguishable-from-human android"" and ""we want storm-trooper-like combat robots"" which are completely incompatible ideas.Now, maybe this just bugs me more than the average person because I've got personal experience with robotics and software development but even the non-technical people I watched this movie found it odd that on the one hand you have Leo, the android, shooting perfect headshots with a pistol while moving (only when convenient) and on the other you have literal walking combat platforms that are unable to hit the broad side of an insurgent with from their stabilized weapons system. It's ridiculous. If you have the capability to program fully capable AGI (artificial general intelligence), making a robot shoot headshots consistently is a preschool level Sunday school arts and crafts project difficulty-wise. Almost any postgraduate computer science major could do it today.The most offensive scene was the hostage situation in front of the bank. Realistically, the bad guys shouldn't have had a chance--they (squishy humans) were caught outflanked and out of cover surrounded by 12+ combat robots. Sure, they had hostages, but even today's military systems can electronically synchronize themselves for coordinated fire. The robots would've just lined up headshots, then simultaneously executed all the baddies in one fell swoop before they can even think to shoot the hostages.",Outside the Wire

375,mattgardner-30853,Good start but drifted towards the end.,5,23 September 2021,"Started off really well, interesting story, few good twists, excellent effects. It opened up a new modern warefare opportunity that could have turned into a franchise. But as it mentioned several times about the drone pilot becoming a cautionary tale, the film it's self was intended to be one and that really confined its potential. And to be honest it does have a point to an extent but that doesn't always entertain and come across as forced.Anthony was good as we're most of the cast generally. But the last 3rd of the film became a predictable and with a rather lack luster ending to make you think rather than finish with a bang.It wasn't a bad ending just anticlimactic.Some of the fight scenes were good, robotics excellent but under used. But the ending was just a bit unbelievablen for several reasons.Over all a entertaining film that started better than it ended, but the moral they tried to hit home with at the end, kind of ruined a good film.

376,rharrisstoertz,"Fast, fun, and satisfying ... More to it than first meets the eye",9,17 January 2021,"So we all want different things in a movie, right? Acting, directing, plot, message, fear, thrills, ... I won't say this movie has all of that. It certainly doesn't. I can see from the other ratings that many viewers were dissatisfied. They want every movie to be an all-time classic, maybe. The acting is not particularly notable in Outside the Wire, but it worked. Anthony Mackie (Captain Leo) does it right ... a believable android and superhero type. Almost a cliche, but with some refreshing twists. Damson Idris (Harp) seemed a little flat, but it was part of his character ... and I found his character likable. You can identify with this guy when he is stricken by the horrors of war. He turns out to be a great Everyman, struggling with impossible choices, trying to do the right thing, forcing himself to go on when he wants to flee. The resistance leader -- not sure of her name -- was great. Such a contrast from expectations!The whole movie was full of surprises like that. I thought it was going to be a problem, all the PC angle and stuff, but they managed to hit the right tone. Even the setting lent itself to that. These are not the conventionalized faces of a civilian population struggling to live in a war zone. It is not Vietnam or the Middle East or a South American drug war, or Somalia. This is Europe. It brings to mind images of World War 2. It is like Kosovo on steroids. The bad guys are your stereotyped Russians, or Russian Ukrainians, kind of like what we might think of as Chechens or something. But they do make for excellent bad guys, with a few interesting twists. They are slightly more humanized than some movies I have seen. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.I thought the portrayal of the US military would annoy me to the point where it brought down the whole movie. It was kind of annoying on some levels. Hollywood (and Netflix, I guess) love to show the military as a bunch of low brow grunts, and it bugs me because I know they are professionals. Leadership is outstanding. So the way they treat this drone pilot is utterly unbelievable ... totally fictionalized and cliched. But I got over that. Just accept it as part of the plot. And they redeem themselves by showing that the US is at least trying to do the right thing. Still, I had problems with the portrayal of drone strikes as these things causing massive civilian casualties. Which brings to mind the thing that I found most unbelievable in the movie: those missile explosions are absolutely ridiculous! What are they, Hellfires or something? A Hellfire can take out a car in traffic and leave adjacent cars almost drivable. Or are they something bigger? No matter, the explosions looked bigger than a 2000 pound bomb. Oh well, part of the thrill!This movie will be enjoyed by people who like military tech movies. The Gumps are absolute fun! I might just go back and watch those many robot scenes again. I love the Boston Dynamics feel to it, the robot dogs mixing in with the soldiers and all that. Battles between robots with humans caught in the crossfire ... that's worth a rating point right there! And man, there are some horrific combat scenes, up close and personal! Maybe not totally realistic, and yes, our protagonist survives things against the odds ... repeatedly ... but still, these scenes are well done and thrilling. You may want to wear your combat goggles for this one, with all the flying concrete chips and stuff.And, saving the best for last, Captain Leo. Captain Leo! Holy smokes! I forgot he was an android, and the scene where he revealed his true nature was definitely a shocker! I haven't seen a robot quite like him in a movie. They took it beyond Terminator. A robot that (maybe?) feels pain, emotion, and compassion. I never could figure whether delivering vaccines was important to him or just a cover, and how real his emotions were. He was definitely your archetype of a complicated character. In the end you can even believe he was tormented, despite his tough exterior. I guess that fits the superhero meme. But what a superhero! Harp knows he is getting close by the trail of bodies. The shootout when Captain Leo gets Viktor Koval is utter, over the top ridiculous pandemonium, and fun as hell. Later, when you see that he really is mortal, you can appreciate what he did there. Here are the real spoilers: was he really a Frankenstein monster trying to destroy his maker because he knew the dangers of his kind? See, that's pretty intense. They did it well. And allowing his destroyer (Harp) to survive, instead of killing him like he kills everyone else is the classic thing we have seen countless times, but I embrace this particular trope. I like to see how different movies do it. It reminds me of the Colonel in Apocalypse Now, setting up his own sacrifice. And what an end!This movie is fast, fun, and satisfying. I didn't think I would rate it this highly until the end, and I didn't think I would watch it again until now, thinking back on it. I probably will.",Outside the Wire

378,RamseyReviews1,Didn't see the point,4,1 February 2021,"Rating: 4 starsSome good action sequences but ultimately the movie came up flat. Found myself confused and questioning the major character twist and it's necessity to the plot.Movie is about an army drone pilot who carelessly disobeys orders and is punished by being reassigned to be a field soldier out in Eastern Europe or (somewhere near Russia, never quite sure where they were). He teams up with a secret cyborg soldier who looks exactly like a real person, to stop a terrorist or terrorist grouping from starting a nuclear war.Found the movie to be at odds with itself. Not sure what to think of the cyborg soldier, Leo, played by Avenger's star Anthony Mackie. Didn't really see the point in him being a cyborg at all. Seamed to me the movie could have been less confusing without it.Also, I never could get behind an army drone pilot turning into a stealth field soldier overnight. Harp, played by Damson Idris, was poorly written. He didn't have anything interesting to say or do really for the majority of the movie. Speaking of the majority of the movie, I couldn't tell what it was that they were doing or who the main antagonist was. I questioned for the majority of this movie, ""what is the point?"" Obviously there is some user error here as I could have paid attention better, but the fact that it was never made clear to me speaks volumes.I like action movies quite a bit and there were some good sequences within there. The robot soldiers had me interested but their role in the movie was poorly executed.

When video screens with American hamburger advertisements run in the market and American flags are hung up, this completely destroys the tension built up until then and leaves the audience stunned. Ukrainian patriots hang up Ukrainian flags! And when suddenly the flashing Chevrolet Escalade appeared, my hair stood on end. In the Ukraine!

459,dwainereyes,When reality meets fantasy,9,15 January 2021,"As a Military Veteran, this film touches a very sentimental place in my heart. Not only did I serve Honorably; I was also blessed to serve as an Analyst during both Desert Shield and parts of OEF. I mention this only because I have been an Instructor to soldiers who would perform the same duties as Lt Harp: never truly witnessing the collateral damage up close yet being ""gung ho"" about terminating insurgent lives without realizing the effects of their decisions.This film brought to the forefront what Lt Harp had been missing. He made decisions based on logic yet wasn't able to understand the need for empathy. Real lives are affected by our decisions. It's only when you can face first hand the after effects of our choices when a soldier in the Intelligence community will be able to do their jobs better.Lt Harp finally understood this after seeing the many orphaned children which were the result of his hand.Understandably, logic needs to be taken into account, however, knowing what the second and third subsequent effects are will help ensure we decide which courses of action are the best to follow through.This film also touched on what could happen should we decide to allow sentient AI the ability to undermine the authority of the chain of command. Many times, our decisions are never the final say. We have a chain of command because the weight of these choices needs to be determined by someone who is able to clearly and responsibly shoulder the effects that happen after a COA has been decided.I really enjoyed the fact that, in this case, what could've become a situation much like ""Terminator"" was assessed by the AI to be a failed judgement and it/he realized it would be much worse to continue making more, as it would only create an endless war scenario.However, the protagonist was also able to impart that we, as a race of intelligent beings, are also able to learn; as our Lt Harp indeed did so.Machines continue to be used in combat situations so the lives of our soldiers aren't wasted but to allow the same freedoms of choice and not ensure a true fail safe would be detrimental to the livelihood of human beings.War never has a true ""winner"". There are always losses incurred and lives changed forever. I'm a prime example of this, as are many of my battle brothers/sisters, both living and passed. Those soldiers, marines, airmen, sailors and officers need to be informed of the realities of every decision we make and how it will affect us after the fact and, more importantly, once we have decided to leave the service of our Nation and resume our civilian lives.This is an very informative but enjoyable film for those thinking of signing up and a decent fictional account of what could be for those still active and those who've served. It may not be vividly blatant but it did a decent job of it; especially when the soldiers beat up Lt Harp. I can remember many times how the soldiers who were boots on the ground would respond to the decisions and COA's those of us in the analyst community made.But know this; we make our decisions using the intelligence we have and knowing that there can and will be casualties. Hopefully, the decisions we make result in the least amount of casualties.Love to my brother and sisters in arms!",Outside the Wire

I mean, they're in a country that's not their own that already have a fighting militia. They're flying drones everywhere like it's a kite festival, someone needs to teach these trigger happy Americans how to get back to where they belong. One person who understood all that was Leo the android. His train of thought was logical and honest, and Harp should have helped him put an end to American military dominance, by sending out the nukes towards nyc and dc...

It's a straight forward action flick that does what it needs to be a solid film.Mackie and Idris have great chemistry throughout. And being Mackie is technically the bigger star, he plays a supporting role to a young up and comer that is capable of holding his own, and in this film it shows.These kinds of films are necessary. Through out Hollywood history, these are the films where new talent gets to show what they can do and new stars are born. Both in front of and behind the camera. The casting is solid, with all supporting actors bringing a performance that serves the story.Overall, I liked the directors approach to tackling the moral question in the film. And how the main actors, especially Damson, really got physically with their acting to convey, either through subtle or large reactions to new information or self realizations, how they were feeling with out verbalizing it in all cases.I ask the people giving it bad reviews saying it's dull and constantly repeats the plot outright, who do you think the film is really targeting? You, the cinema aficionado, or the casual viewer who might be as young as 16-17 that hasn't seen an extensive collection of action films, never mind general cinema, to be able to tell whether this is bad or not. If I saw this when I was 15-16-17, or even young or a little older, I'd be entertained and probably other people it was solid.It was a fun watch and I hope all the Haters next time just turn on the criterion collection channel and watch ""Heat"" on repeat so they get their fix of ""quality cinema"" to maintain their titles as film auteurs.",Outside the Wire

If a MAJCOM patch in this case ACC (Air Combat Command) the patch would be on the left sleeve and organizational patch on the right sleeve under the US Flag. Gets worse.. during what appears the actor's discovery board at the 7 minute mark he is wearing along with all the board members the inappropriate US Flag on the the right sleeve. This US Flag patch is for US Army uniform and never has been for the USAF. Also all the actors ""name tapes"" are not in the matching OCP pattern on the right chest yet the USAF tape does match. At the 10 minute mark actor is wearing the appropriate US Flag patch but is wearing a ""ball cap"" on a deployment which is inappropriate.Anyway get it right if portraying the military.

I'm a huge movie fanatic, I know good movies & this just flat Out is one. I never, ever, write a review on movies but could not help but to write one for this movie. Like I literally just made and an account to write this movie.Now I've saw plenty of bad movies & go about my day, like damn that was a terrible movie, but I couldn't with this one. Reason being I love the Show 'Snowfall', if you haven't seen it check it out, harp is main character in the show. Does a great job. But anyways like I said I'm a fan of the show, so I follow Damson Idris (Harp) on Twitter. He's on there talking about ""can't wait until Jan 15th, y'all ain't saw acting yet. Y'all gone be blown away buy this movie"" etc... Then you actually watch the movie and THIS WAS IT. Tuhhh. Waste of my mf time. It's like do the directors and actors not watch the movie as its being filmed or when it's finish??? There's no way they do!!! How do you want to grow as an actor but you back trash garbage like this? Denzel would never just take any script and be in it. It has to be worth his time. It Has to at LEAST MAKE SENSE. Not 56,000 hours of drone flying or whatever the hell it was, and he's only 19. Are you kidding me. (Damson Idris ""harp"") couldn't challenge this and ask the screenwriter can we change this because it makes absolutely no sense AT ALL? I'm a strong believer they just recorded this, edit it, and put it out. No dialogue between people who wrote the scripts and director or actors. They all just said, Ok cool let's do this. Nobody questioned anything.Now for my boy from 7 mile aka Falcon, he did a cool job. Still was super light acting but wasn't bad. But he always acts like that so that's nothing new. Wasn't expecting anything spectacular from him. But harp on other hand I definitely was. He was just so boring in the movie and no feel to grasp the attention from the viewers. In the beginning he says yes sir, no sir, sorry sir to everybody in the movie and acts like a little timid boy. Painting the picture that he's nobody, but then 30 mins into the movie he's questioning his superior officer and talking out of place. Main example, acts like he not gone get in the truck if he doesn't have answers after that weak sniper scene when they drop off medicine. Or when they get to White lady village day care and he's asking question when Nobody was talking to him. Like huhhh? I can go on and on about this dumb movie. Like how falcon is a robot but feels PAIN when a little chip is removed or when he's shot. I blame the director. Pure idiot. Also there was a part in the movie where harp is middle of shoot out with hostages everywhere and he stands up and tells them come on I'll get you to cover but it was literally in the middle of cross fire and no one got hit. They dam near walked to the coffee shop for cover with no urgency. Why did harp go to to the nuc plant at the end ???? For what, there was absolutely no point. To see if he falcon was really there to bomb it??? Bro Yal was following him with the Drone, YALL literally see him driving there and hoping out of the truck. So there's your answer. HE's there, ok now just shoot the drone. But nahhhhh they had harp go there get his ass chocked out, wakes up, shoots dude and calls in the air strike. Could have change the narrative with letting the nuc go off since he killed 2 people to save 38 and could have killed 1 mil or whatever to save 300 mill . And you would think that's why falcon wanted him in the first place. Because he would understand...kill a few to save hella. But nope typical played out story line.

The main problem of the scenario, in addition to the fact that it is banal and of low quality, is that important historical facts are mixed up, which are now decisive in the conflict in eastern Europe.
My country is presented as a wild aggressor, while in reality Ukraine is the first country that actually gave up nuclear weapons in order to preserve peace.
Ukraine it paid for it with the Russian annexation and the war that has been going on since 2014. Thank you of course Netflix but I think that this is humiliating for both Ukraine and the United States.

Everyone in this crisis can be a ""bad guy"" at times of his life, because of his or her own individual disposition, and in the perspective of others.

Newbie gets to the camp, meets more experienced mentor, experiences combat, handles it badly for a while, twist, he ends up on his own and somehow completes the mission.There are some cool parts to the story though. Most notably for me was the parallel between Leo and the standard combat drones.
He more or less wants the US to consider the consequences to their new weapon systems, that's why he does what he does. You can see it throughout the movie including the collateral damage from drone strikes, but more interesting is the fact that their combat robots have a tendency to fire first.
Sure their targets are armed and behaving in a threatening manner. But as demonstrated by Leo defusing the situation by the relief truck it doesn't have to end with a firefight.There's also an interesting parallel between them sending a drone pilot to experience combat in order to understand what happens when they fire a missile and the US learning the consequences of their weapons by one of those weapons turning against them. That's why Leo *MUST* be the one to do it.All in all a solid film. But it does suffer from some boneheaded mistakes including: the protagonist having over 56000 flight hours, that's 6 years 24/7, or 18 years full time. As such I would expect him to be in his late thirties at least, but I don't think the character was more than 25...
The Balkans being mentioned frequently despite the movie taking place in Ukraine some 600 miles and several countries away. And sure that one can be handwaved away, most of the time they are referring to a person, ""the terror of the Balkans"" and therefore not technically wrong.

Not just because it's Anthony but this is good for anybody!
Unfortunately performances this good have a profound effect on the story line. Why? Because it builds value.

714,sergiykha,Modern futuristic fantasy with a pinch of sadness,10,23 January 2021,Worth to watch it just to imagine your own responsibilities for what happens in life around you.,Outside the Wire
715,zulutrystan,Emotional intelligence necessary,9,19 January 2021,"Found this a great film, deep and emotionally twisted plot under a hardend logical plot. Not just action and violence but a deeper storyline. Maybe how I read into things and blatantly just an opinion. It seems a hero is not often a ""Hero"" story.",Outside the Wire
716,jamconsulting,"Great idea, horrible execution",1,6 February 2021,"This movie had a great concept, but was horribly executed. Reasonable acting could not do anything with absolutely horrible plot holes.A robot who is willing to kill millions lets some guy he just met live, MULTIPLE TIMES??A guy that screws up in the military multiple times, and has repeatedly shown an in-ability to do the right thing is trusted at the very end with saving the world?In order to leave a camp at the beginning of the movie you need armed escort, yet this kid with no experience leaves the camp in a ford focus alone?The big bad in the movie just LETS a killer robot in his midst so easily?The military trusts what this idiot kid says?NONE of the plot lines make sense. The potential wasted by this movie with EASILY FIXABLE plot deviations is just ridiculous.My 10 year old could have fixed this.",Outside the Wire
717,boovie,Did we even see the same movie?,7,11 February 2021,"There are so many bad reviews by people who only rated this single movie that I actually had to check on my own if it's really that bad to justify it...The answer is - no. This is a solid science fiction movie with good optics and a strange atmosphere that reminded me of ""children of men"". While it clearly is not at the same level, it has its own quality. Although it surely looks like an action flic there is a little more to it. Its tension is driven by the relationship between the two unequal main characters and the riddle that Harp has to solve: why has he really been assigned to that mission?Surely more fun to watch than the ordinary dumb 5 star action movie...",Outside the Wire

720,carsonreed,This is a bad movie,1,20 January 2021,This movie didn't do a minute of research. It was wildly unwatchable. Unfortunate because the acting wasn't awful. 10 minutes of research could have made this a decent film.,Outside the Wire
721,farvawho,"So, so bad",2,21 January 2021,"If you've spent a day in the US military, avoid this like the plague. If you know ANYTHING at all about UAV/RPA operations, see above. The action/plot is so unbelievable, and the military aspects absolutely laughable. A little research would have gone a long way.I feel like maybe Marvel threw a couple grand to the producers to get the world ready to see Anthony Mackle referred to as ""Cap.""This was a struggle to finish.",Outside the Wire

724,devilshands,"I was looking for fun, light-hearted, Friday night viewing and got more than I deserved!and",10,16 January 2021,"I was looking for something fun and action filled for my Friday night and this film had it in buckets. It starts out with tense standoffs where you genuinely ask yourself - what would I do?! As the film progresses you believe that you begin begin to understand the characters...before ending up in a rollercoaster of twists, action and a real crisis of conscience. I didn't know what to expect but here I am reviewing this great film. Crack a beer, put your feet up and enjoy 2 hours that pass way too quickly. You can thank the writer later.",Outside the Wire
