0,bkoganbing,Those Gaming Skills,7,25 December 2013,"Although any number of young people I know are addicted to those video games they do apparently serve a purpose. For some years now our military has sought to attract recruits who enjoy those games and possess those skills on the games. A lot of our weaponry with computer guidance targeting are tailor made for those who are skilled at video games. The Last Starfighter literally ratchets that concept exponentially up right into the universe.Lance Guest is such a kid who lives in some trailer park with mother Barbara Bosson and brother Chris Hebert. He's set a record on a video game that brings him to the attention of an alien played by Robert Preston who set the game up. He's in the market for pilots all over the universe to face an alien enemy. The weaponry that Guest would face is very graphically described in the game itself.It takes a while but Lance Guest recognized his destiny soon enough even though he's one reluctant computer warrior. He and Dan O'Herlihy face off against a video game like battle against a fleet only this one's for real.Preston and O'Herlihy play a fine pair of aliens and this was Preston's farewell big screen appearance although he did two more made for TV films.Some nice computer graphics and fine performances by the ensemble cast characterize The Last Starfighter. So parents don't discourage your kid's time on computer games, they could be in training to save earth itself from invasion.",The Last Starfighter
1,SnoopyStyle,80s sci-fi classic,8,31 March 2015,"Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) lives in a trailer park with his mother Jane and little brother Louis. They manage the park. He's great at the video arcade game Starfighter and he beats the record. He has big dreams to go somewhere else. His girlfriend Maggie Gordon (Catherine Mary Stewart) is scared to leave her granny. His college loan gets turned down. Centauri (Robert Preston) is the inventor of Starfighter and arrives with a futuristic car. Centauri takes him to outer space while leaving behind Beta which takes on Alex's form. Centauri is recruiting for Starfighters but Earth is not really a member of the Star League. Xur has betrayed his people to lead the Ko-Dan warships past the Frontier. He wants to take over Rylan from his father and destroy the Star League. Alex refuses to fight and returns home. He is attacked by an alien bounty hunter and Centauri is mortally wounded. He returns to find the base heavily damaged and navigator Grig with the last Gunstar. Without any training and only one ship, the last Starfighter Alex must destroy an armada and rescue the galaxy.This is fun sci-fi action adventure with some of the earliest CGI. It's blocky and ancient but workable nevertheless. The story is just great. It taps into every child's dream of living their video games for real. It is a really fun timeless story that would work great as a remake with modern CG.",The Last Starfighter
2,Prismark10,Good for video game junkies,5,16 September 2018,"The Last Starfighter came out in 1984 and aimed at the arcade generation and burgeoning home computer market like the film Wargames a year earlier.It is really a cheesy B movie enlivened by Robert Preston as Centauri who recruits arcade whizz kid Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) to fight space battles for real. The arcade game, The Last Starfighter is a test, if you break the records a representative comes for you to become a real intergalactic fighter pilot. Although reluctant at first, Rogan is saving the galaxy fighting the Ko-dan forces. A double of Rogan, who is a robot has taken his place at the trailer park hanging out with his girlfriend and trying to pass off as human.There are some nice special effects for its time including CGI in the climactic space battle. However it is too often let down by a slow moving story which is just padding even at the end of the movie which I suspect is a set up to a sequel that never materialised.Some of the visual effects now look dated and you can tell the trailer park is really a film studio. However the film is just too corny and all you end up remembering is Preston's extravagant flim flam man character.",The Last Starfighter
3,claudio_carvalho,One of My Favorite Cult-Movies of the 80's,7,29 January 2012,"Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) lives in a trailer park with his mother Jane Rogan (Barbara Bosson) and his younger brother Louis (Chris Hebert). Alex is a handyman that helps his neighbors in small tasks and he is waiting for a loan to go to the university and move from the camp with his girlfriend Maggie Gordon (Catherine Mary Stewart) to the city. However, Alex receives a letter informing that his request of loan had been denied for his great deception. When Alex breaks the record of the Starfighter video game, he is visited by a man called Centauri (Robert Preston) that tells him that he works in the company that manufactures the game and invites him to a ride in his car. Sooner Alex learns that Centauri's car is a spacecraft and the Starfighter game is actually a test to find skilled warriors to protect the Star League frontier against Xur (Normam Snow) and Kodan (George McDaniel) armada. Alex arrives in the planet Rylos but he refuses the invitation. Alex returns to his house and finds that he is hunted by alien agents sent by Xur to kill him. He summons Centauri and learns that all the starfighters have been murdered in a treacherous attack to the Rylos' base. Now, Alex and his partner Grig (Dan O'Herlihy) are the last chance to avoid the invasion of the cruel Xur.""The Last Starfighter"" is one of my favorite cult-movies of the 80's. The artless special effects are very poor in the present day but who cares? The delightful story of a teenager that dreams on going away from the trailer camp where he lives and becomes the savior of the universe is highly entertaining and also funny, since the situation of the Beta Alex with Maggie is hilarious. Unfortunately this film has only been released on VHS in Brazil. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Último Guerreiro das Estrelas"" (""The Last Warrior from the Stars"")",The Last Starfighter
4,gavin6942,Victory or Death!,6,3 September 2006,"""The Last Starfighter"" tells the tale of Alex Rogan, a high school senior who spends too much time playing a video game called Starfighter. But once he breaks the high score, he learns the game is merely a test and he must now fight to defend the entire universe. Huzzah!This strange space story is brought to us by Nick Castle, who was best known for writing ""Escape From New York"", but also directed such mindless junk as ""Major Payne"". This film lies somewhere between the two, and is surprisingly good considering most of the people in this film are D-list stars (and even that might be generous).I really wish I had seen this before watching the ""Clerks"" cartoons... it would have made the pyramid building episode have a lot more sense. But, I guess that was my own fault.Wil Wheaton is credited in this film, but his scenes were cut. Funny, really, since he's now debatably the most famous person who was involved with this project. I know his presence would have greatly improved by movie-watching experience.The special effects are fantastic. The film used mostly ""old school"" makeup and costuming, which is really very good in a scene where a Beta unit becomes human (this makes sense once you see it). Only in ""The Thing"" can I recall such impressive transformations. And the computer effects are a little dated, but incredible for the time period. I would rank them even better than the effects of ""Tron"", which probably had a bigger budget (though I don't know that for sure).I have only two complaints. The bigger complaint is how dated this film is. It is an 80s film and can only be appreciated as an 80s film. The idea of a video game being hugely important is a very 80s concept (""The Wizard"", ""Big"", ""Tron"", and others). Making this same movie today would seem quite silly (although they could make it Internet rather than game based, and risk dating it all over again). (I assume this film was an Atari advertisement.)The lesser complaint is the old folks' reaction to Alex's high score. Everyone comes running to see him beat the record, and his girlfriend is all excited and kisses him. What world do they live in? On the planet I live on, girlfriends avoid video games and old folks think kids don't know how to play outside. But, it's a movie.If you want some 80s excitement, this is a good treat to watch with other such films (maybe ""Flight of the Navigator"" and ""Mac and Me""). But it really can only be appreciated by those with 80s nostalgia, I fear.",The Last Starfighter
5,Woodyanders,Hugely enjoyable 80's sci-fi treat,8,11 September 2013,"Average guy trailer park resident Alex Rogan (a fine and likable performance by Lance Guest) gets recruited through a video game to join the Star League as a star fighter and make a stand against an evil alien empire that wants to conquer the universe. Director Nick Castle and screenwriter Jonathan R. Betuel bring a winning surplus of sheer charm, heart, and warmth to the highly entertaining story. Most importantly, Castle and Betuel keep a firm grasp on the humorous and engaging human element throughout. Robert Preston gives the movie a tremendously galvanizing lift with his delightfully vibrant portrayal of shrewd and smooth-talking intergalactic con man Centauri. Dan O'Herlithy also excels as jolly gung-ho reptilian navigator Grig. The lovely Catherine Mary Stewart radiates considerable appeal as Alex's sweet girlfriend Maggie. Guest does impressive double work as both the reluctant Alex and bumbling robot lookalike Beta. Norman Snow as the arrogant Xur and Dan Mason as the stern, no-nonsense Lord Kril make for colorful villains. The crude CGI effects are certainly lacking compared to the more sophisticated stuff in current mainstream fare, but they get the job done just the same. Moreover, there's a nice theme about having the necessary courage to realize one's potential. Craig Safan's robust and majestic score hits the stirring and sweeping spot. An immensely fun and amiable affair.",The Last Starfighter
6,ma-cortes,Fun film about a youngster who is recruited to help save a far planet under attack,6,9 October 2011,"This is a hybrid of Sci-Fi/fantasy/ and comedy ; dealing with a video-gaming boy, seemingly doomed to remain at his trailer park home all his existence , finds himself enlisted as a gunner for an alien defense force. He is named Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) who lives in a remote trailer court where his mummy (Barbara Bosson) is manager and everyone is like a big extended family and along with his enjoyable girlfriend (Catherine Mary Stewart) . Meantime, Alex turns the top player of Starfighter, a stand-up arcade game where the player guards ""the frontier"" from ""Xur and the Kodan armada"" in a space battle ,after getting video game prowess it makes him the main objective from extraterrestrial forces as good aliens as bad aliens. After achieving his best score, he is approached by the Arcade game's inventor, named Centauri (old Robert Preston's last movie). In his wildest dreams Alex never suspected that tonight he would become...The Last Starfighter , a gunner from outland and all sorts of bizarre things begin to happen . Stepping into Centauri's vehicle, he is seemingly doomed to stay at his roulette all in his life ; however ,he soon finds himself recruited as prime pilot for an alien defense force (commanded by Daniel O'Herlihy) to do battle in outer space and take on arch-villains.This agreeable comedy/Sci-Fi film packs action , comic dialog ,hilarious situations, thrills , a love story and is pretty entertaining . Passable computer generator FX , though nowadays dated , with spectacular dogfighting and innovative by that time of the 80s. Very good and rousing musical score by Craig Safan in John Williams style .Likable Lance Guest as a videogaming boy living in a trailer park home who undertakes a risked adventure , a gorgeous and enjoyable Catherine Mary Stewart and Dan O'Herlihy who's unrecognizable in lizard-like makeup ; of course , excellent, as always, veteran Robert Preston as Centauri who actually is a disguised alien who whisks him off to another planet . The motion picture is professionally directed by Nick Castle . He is a prestigious writer and filmmaker as ¨The boy who could fly , ¨Tag : assassination game¨ , ¨Delivering Milo¨ , ¨Dennis the menace¨, ¨Major Payne¨ and ¨Tap¨. It's viewing delight and amusing though toothless entertainment that benefits greatly from sympathetic acting and rudimentary but effective special effects.",The Last Starfighter
7,BandSAboutMovies,An amazing burst of nostalgia,8,9 October 2019,"As much as we decry practical effects over CGI - in the same way we demand physical media over streaming - there are times when it doesn't have to be all that bad. I decided that instead of finding a poor example of computer generated animation, I'd share something that I love.While the first CGI in mainstream film was probably 1976's Futureworld (several modern techniques were innovated in this film, from an animated CGI hand that was taken from Edwin Catmull's 1972 experimental short subject A Computer Animated Hand and an animated face from Fred Parke's 1974 experimental short subject Faces & Body Parts to an early example of digital compositing to place live actors over a previously filmed background), the two movies that I can really remember to use extensive computer-generated imagery were Tron and The Last Starfighter.In place of physical spaceships, 3D rendered models were used to depict this film's Gunstar and spacecraft. Their designs came from artist Ron Cobb, who also worked on Dark Star, Alien, Star Wars, Conan the Barbarian and wrote the initial script for Dark Skies, which Steven Spielberg rewrote into the mich friendlier E.T. He's also listed in the credits for Back to the Future as DeLorean Time Travel Consultant.There are over 27 minutes of effects in this film, which was a tremendous amount of computer animation for its time. However, this animation required half the time of the traditional miniature special effects, allowed the film to be made for just $14 million dollars.That said - there are still plenty of practical effects, like the creature and Beta Unit special makeup, as well as the Centauri's Starcar, which was a real vehicle created by Gene Winfield, who also created the spinners for Blade Runner and the 6000 SUX for RoboCop. His car design for The Reactor was used in a variety of TV shows, including Catwoman's Catmobile on the Batman TV show, the Jupiter 6 car in the ""Bread and Circuses"" episode of Star Trek, Bewitched and Mission: Impossible, where it was part of a scheme to make a bank robber believe that they'd been asleep for 14 years.The idea that video games were recruiting players for some high end military service started as an urban legend that games like Missile Command were saving information on its players so that they'd be ready to defend America from the inevitable Russian ICBM strike that was coming in the 1980's. There was also the There's also the weird tale of Polybius, a video game that never existed - or did it? - that was an MK Ultra style experiment unleashed on Portland, Oregon arcades that led to addiction, hallucinations and visits by the Men in Black. Obviously, those legends led to this film or this is all an elaborate piece of disinformation to hide the truth in plain sight. I leave your version of reality up to you, dear reader.
Alex Rogan (Lance Guest, Halloween 2) is going nowhere, stuck in a trailer park taking care of everyone else. His scholarship has been rejected and he has to keep fixing things and watching his little brother instead of getting to spend time with Maggie (Catherine Marie Stewart, The Apple).The only fun he has is playing the Starfighter arcade game in the trailer park, which allows him to pretend that he's defending the Frontier from Xur and his Ko-Dan Armada.After Alex becomes the game's highest-scoring player, the game's inventor Centauri visits, offering him a ride in his fancy car as a prize. He's played by Robert Preston, who is really just reprising his role as Harold Hill from The Music Man, which is an ingenious gambit.The car is really a spaceship and Alex is taken to meet the Rylan Star League while a Beta Unit is used to replace him on Earth. That's when he learns that the game is actually a training unit meant to find starfighters ready to battle the very real Ko-Dan Empire.Alex is expected to be the gunner for the Gunstar along with the reptilian navigator Grig (Dan O'Herlihy, who pretty much owned the 1980's between this movie, playing Conal Cochran in Halloween 3: Season of the Witch and the Old Man in RoboCop). However, all our hero wants to do is go home.It takes alien assassins attacking the trailer park and the death of all of the other starfighters and Centauri - who takes a laser blast meant for our hero - for Alex to join the cause. While he fights the Armada in space, Beta and Maggie battle the Zando-Zan killers back down on good old Mother Earth.Of course, Alex has the gift that all great starfighters need and saves the day. He lands his ship on the trailer park and takes Maggie into space with him, while his brother starts playing the game in the hopes of joining his brother.This is a film with real heart, beyond its aspirations of being a blockbuster. It's directed by Nick Castle, who you probably already know played Michael Myers in the original Halloween. What you may not know is that he wrote the movie Skatetown U.S.A. or directed Tag: The Assassination Game, The Boy Who Could Fly and Dennis the Menace. Plus, he, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace all formed The Coup De Villes and played much of the music for Big Trouble In Little China.Despite the film being based on the idea of an arcade game, there never really was one despite the promise in the closing credits of an Atari created edition. The game was actually started and would have been Atari's first 3D polygonal arcade game to use a Motorola 68000 as the CPU. It would have used the Star Wars arcade controls and been much like the game Lance Guest plays in the film, but it was canceled once Atari representatives saw the film in post-production and decided it was not going to be a financial success. That said there were Atari home versions in development and they were eventually released as Star Raiders II and Solaris.There is an NES game - it's a reskin of the computer game Uridium - and Rogue Synapse created a freeware PC game in 2007 that's very close to the game in the film.The themes of The Last Starfighter have been repeated in plenty of other stories, like Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game and Ernest Cline's Armada, which is pretty much a note for note reboot of the same story. Of course, Cline wrote Ready: Player One and works in a reference to the original film, but he wears his influences on his sleeve. Interestingly enough, Wil Wheaton read the audio version of this book - which will be a movie soon enough that'll cost a hundred times what The Last Starfighter did and have a sliver of the soul - and he appears in this film.If you're looking for a great slice of 1984, you can't go wrong with this movie. I love that it has a lizard best friend, fun spaceship designs, the Music Man conning people for money in the midst of a galactic war and even the promise of a sequel which never came. It's the kind of movie that would always be a rental that everyone could agree on or the perfect film to veg out whenever HBO showed it for the two hundredth time.",The Last Starfighter
8,hitchcockthelegend,You have been recruited by The Star League to defend the frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.,7,14 August 2011,"The Last Starfighter is directed by Nick Castle and written by Jonathan R. Betuel. It stars Lance Guest, Robert Preston, Catherine Mary Stewart, Dan O'Herlihy and Norman Snow. Music is by Craig Safan and cinematography by King Baggot. Story sees Guest as Alex Rogan, an everyday teenage boy who upon breaking the high-score record on a trailer park arcade game, suddenly finds himself recruited by an alien defence unit to fight an evil army out in space.The advancements of computers and all their devilish electronic off shoots have rendered many of the pioneering effects films of yesteryear as rudimentary antiques. Where once films like ""Tron"" and ""The Last Starfighter"" blazed the trail that many would follow over the years, now they seem, if you believe the multitude of new era reviews for them, to hold only nostalgia value to video game players who were still at school in the early 1980's. That's something of a disservice, for although they do indeed rely in the main on effects work and razz dazzle 80's credibility, the stories are enjoyably fantastical and not without thought and merit.The Last Starfighter is one of the better ones because it manages to be both an exciting and sweet picture, one that is completely disarming. Certainly it marries Spielberg homespun values with George Lucas operatics, but in the form of its teen protagonist it also dots the fantasy canvas with angsty worth. So much so that now when one revisits the film with older eyes, we can appreciate more fully that young Alex is in a rut, the crossroads of his life, a life he's struggling to make sense of. Also more appreciation can now be made of the relationship Alex has with Grig (O'Herlihy), his flight navigator up in the galaxy, someone whom he calls a Gung-Ho iguana! This relationship is nicely drawn, here is where Alex finds not only his friend, but also his father figure, something he doesn't have the privilege of down on Earth.Whilst up there fighting an intergalactic battle, Alex on Earth has been replaced by a Replicant Beta Model to ensure he is not missed. Here is where much of the film's fun is gleaned from. Interesting to note that originally this arc in the film wasn't to be that huge, but test screenings encouraged director Castle into a rethink. And the film is the better for it as the Beta tries to keep the flame going with the girlfriend (Stewart adorable girl next door type) and ensure he's not found out by any Ko-Dan spies! Here Guest earns his corn, it's a very good duel performance from the youngster and it's a shame his career never really took off post the film's release.However, none of this means the film is full of depth, it still remains a very simple story full of fantastical incredulity. But the underlying message of improving oneself, not settling for second best, is rich and puts some potency in the narrative. Still, it's safe to say that most tuning into The Last Starfighter want whizz bang space adventure frolics, which thankfully we do get. The effects are of course variable, though not as cheap looking in High Definition as one expected, while the action is nicely constructed by Castle and his team. The villains led by a Po-faced Norman Snow make their mark, while Robert Preston, a legend to Western and film noir fans in the 40's and 50's, gives a wonderfully sweet and affecting turn as Centauri, the game inventor who whisks Alex away to the planet Rylos for his life changing challenge.More than just a film for nostalgists and gamer types, Last Starfighter is pretty solid entertainment from its core to the outer layers. 7/10",The Last Starfighter
9,CinemaSerf,Good family fun.,7,10 October 2021,"Just think back to when you spent hours on your Atari games console playing space invaders, without realising that one day you might save the world? Well ""Alex"" (Lance Guest), a bored teenager living in a trailer park doing odd jobs might just prove to be just such a man. Well, at least this is what ""Centauri"" (Robert Preston) thinks and leaving a perfectly plausible android doppelgänger in his place, recruits our young man to prevent the evil ""Kril"" (Dan Mason) and ""Enduran"" (Kay Kuter) and their overwhelmingly superior force of spacecraft from conquering us all. Can he do it? Can he thwart the cunning plan? It's quite a fun fantasy adventure this, Guest joins in wholeheartedly as does Preston and there are plenty of special effects to drown out the occasionally boo-hiss romantic elements with ""Maggie"" (Catherine Mary Stewart). There is plenty of humour, too - mostly from Preston and Guest makes for an easy on the eye hero for all to get behind. It's actually stood the test of time quite well, as many simple ideas do, and I really quite enjoyed it.",The Last Starfighter
10,utgard14,Trust Centauri,7,29 March 2014,"Trailer park kid Alex (Lance Guest) gets the high score on the video game Starfighter. Shortly after he finds himself recruited by an alien named Centauri (Robert Preston) to take part in an intergalactic war. One of my favorites from my childhood. I'm not sure if you have to be a child of the '80s to enjoy this but it probably doesn't hurt. It's a character-driven sci-fi adventure film with a wonderful cast. In addition to Guest and Preston, who are both excellent, there's the great Dan O'Herlihy and beautiful Catherine Mary Stewart. Special mention to kid actor Chris Hebert, who's lots of fun as Alex's little brother. If you don't walk around with your nose in the air or a stick up your rear, give this one a shot and you will probably enjoy it. It's a fun movie.",The Last Starfighter
11,zardoz-13,Sci-Fi Fun,8,8 November 2013,"""Tag: The Assassination"" director Nick Castle's adventurous, but derivative, science-fiction, fantasy ""The Last Starfighter"" features references both visual and literary to ""Star Wars"" and ""Back to the Future,"" but contains enough originality to stand out on its own. Lance Guest plays the eponymous protagonist, while Robert Preston, Catherine Mary Stewart, and Dan O'Herlihy co-star in this affable 1980's opus. ""Corvette Summer"" composer Craig Safan's boisterous music heightens the heroics. Although digital special effects were in their infancy, ""The Last Starfighter"" distinguished itself as the first Hollywood film that generated its own visual effects with a computer. This means that some people may complain about the primitive quality of the CGI, but this material was ground-breaking during its theatrical release. Visually, Castle and ""Invaders from Mars"" lenser King Baggott have conjured up some epic scenes, particularly when Centauri ferries Alex to Rylos. Honestly, the only shortcoming that I could find with their state-of-the-art CGI is that everything appears too sleek, clean, and unrealistic. Narratively, ""My Science Project"" scenarist Jonathan R. Betuel and Castle have fashioned an appealing, sentimental, but exciting actioneer that occurs in two settings. Nice guy teenager Alex Rogen (Lance Guest of ""Halloween 2"") lives in a rural trailer park with his mom Jane (Barbara Bosson) and younger brother Louis (Chris Hebert), who hides issues of ""Playboy"" magazines from his mother. Alex plays a first-person shooter, sci-fi, video game. Actually, this video game was not supposed to be shipped to Alex's trailer park but to another location. One evening, Alex achieves the highest recorded score, with friends and family applauding his triumphant victory. Before Alex realizes it, an eccentric scalawag, Centauri (Robert Preston of ""The Music Man""), cruises up in a DeLorean and makes him an intriguing offer. Alex's record-breaking score has qualified him to serve as a pilot in the the Star League an alien space fleet called that is waging a rebellion against a greater evil. Centauri's DeLorean transforms into a spacecraft and they leave Earth. At the same time, Centauri provides Alex with a Beta Unit that masquerades as our hero while Alex suits up and shoots it out with the aliens. Mind you, Alex constitutes a reluctant hero. During the briefing scene, Alex is alarmed when his new colleagues rant about ""Victory or Death"" against their adversaries. Initially, he doesn't want to sacrifice his life in what he sees as a lopsided battle that pits the Rylan Star League against the ""Black Terror"" of the Kodan Empire. Indeed, the gigantic, disembodied noggin of the opposition leader, Xur (Norman Snow), appears as a holographic image at Rylan Headquarters, and we learn Xur is the son of Ambassador Enduran (Kay E. Kuter) and that the Star League exiled him because of his Xurian cult. ""I have returned for the good of all Rylans,"" the outcast Ur proclaims to Enduran. Moreover, he assures his father, ""There are some Rylans who would welcome me, Father."" He displays nothing but contempt for his father as well as Rylos and calls it, ""A refuge for weak worlds not worthy to be our equals."" The evil Kodans launch a pre-emptive strike against Rylos and wipe out all the starfighters.Meanwhile, Centauri has taken Alex back home so our hero can confront his Beta Unit. He discovers the evil Kodans have learned that he is the last starfighter. Unwilling to leave any loose ends, the aliens dispatch killers to eliminate Alex. Of course, Alex is the underdog who saves the good aliens from the evil ones and reunites with his girlfriend. Castle keeps the action moving with no loss of momentum. Sure, Alex is no more than a Luke Skywalker clone, but Guest makes him a nice guy. In his final film performance, Robert Preston stands out as the finagling Centauri. The aliens resemble those in the cantina scene from George Lucas' ""Star Wars."" Some minor profanity crops up, but nothing truly offensive. ""The Last Starfighter"" ranks as a lot of fun.",The Last Starfighter
12,view_and_review,Nice Try,4,18 October 2019,"How could I enjoy this movie after having seen Star Wars? And this is not a comparison of a 1984 film to a 2000's film, this is a comparison of a 1984 film to a 1977, 1980, and 1983 film. And if you throw in there Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) then there is no avenue for The Last Starfighter to be even considered.In this space battle movie, Alex Rogan (Lance Guest), is a young man who feels trapped in the mobile home park he lives in. His only escape is a videogame called Starfighter. When he beats the game he is soon visited by an alien that wants his services for a real intergalactic battle.As I said, I couldn't get excited about this movie at all. The visual effects and even the plot were crummy compared to the Star Wars saga. Nice try though.",The Last Starfighter
13,AlsExGal,The Music Man Meets Star Wars,6,30 December 2017,"A recent high school grad (Lance Guest as Alex Rogan) lives in a rural traier park that his mother runs. Despite having a great girlfriend (Catherine Mary Stewart as Maggie) and a loving family, like any kid in his late teens he wants to see what is in the wider world, specifically he wants to go to college. But that requires a scholarship, and when he doesn't get one, that means he is stuck where he is, going to community college. Out of frustration and boredom he is given to playing ""The Last Starfighter"" video game that is in the park's rec area. Then one night Alex breaks the record on the game, and is surprised when the alien Centauri (Robert Preston) lands and asks him to come with him, that as the winner of the game he has won a great surprise of a prize.Alex finds out that the surprise is that Centauri is an intergalactic con man who marketed the game to find somebody with the ability to be a Starfighter and basically simulated the actual war between the democratic Rylan Star League and the autocratic Ko-Dan Empire in the game. Alex says he did not sign up to get himself killed and asks to be taken back to earth.Right after Alex leaves, the Starfighter base with all of the Rylan fighters is blown up due to sabotage and the Starfighters killed - except for one, Alex. The Empire sends a hitman after him in the trailer park, and he would have succeeded if not for Centauri interceding. Centauri tells him the empire will send more and more of these hit men and that the only way Alex can protect himself and his family is go back and be a Starfighter. Except now he is literally ""the last Starfighter"".If this all sounds a bit like Star Wars - autocratic empire versus democratic good guys, a young man who wants adventure who finds himself in the middle of things, etc. that is because it is. Unfortunately, the villain doesn't really measure up. That would be Xur, a traitor from Rylos to whom the Ko-Dan Emperor has promised control of Rylos in return for giving the empire vital information. Xur plays this role as a campy man child who walks around talking to his scepter. Not exactly Darth Vader. There are some humorous bits - Robert Preston in his last feature film doing a send up of his conman role in The Music Man, and the robotic likeness of Alex who Centauri placed on earth so that Alex's friends and family don't notice he is missing while he is out saving the galaxy. The problem is that the robotic likeness just doesn't get 20th century ""mating rituals"" as he calls them, and manages to alienate Maggie in Alex's absence, and also frighten Alex's little brother when, in the middle of the night, the Alex clone decides to get up and repair his head.The ending makes it look like the film was setting itself up for a sequel, but that never happened as the box office didn't really pay off. This was a summer movie in 1984 and much was expected, but it did not pan out. I'd still mildly recommend it, largely for the wonderful Robert Preston who unfortunately is not around for most of the film.",The Last Starfighter
14,FlashCallahan,When did the hangar go up......,6,6 November 2014,"Alex lives in a remote trailer court where his mother is manager and everyone is like a big extended family. Alex becomes the top scorer of Starfighter, a stand-up arcade game where the player defends ""the Frontier"" from ""Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada"" in a space battle. After achieving his best score, he is approached by the game's inventor, Centauri. Stepping into Centauri's vehicle, he is seemingly doomed to stay at his trailer park home all in his life, he finds himself recruited as a gunner for an alien defence force when Centauri is a disguised alien who whisks him off to another planet.....Its a sound idea, having a kid get recruited because he is great at a video game, but one cannot help that this was done before in the movie 'Nightmare' an anthology horror movie that featured Emilio Estevez as a gaming wiz who gets sucked into the video game.This was made a year later....But anyhow, that's just nitpicking, its a fun movie, with a hilarious villain, and who couldn't love a movie more when you find out Grig was played by 'The Old Man' in Robocop.And the effects. Even though they are nothing compared to today, or even a few years after this, they still make the movie, and they really compliment the films narrative.Other than that, its a fish out of water tale of your average Joe, becoming something they had never dreamt of.Plus it stars Lance Guest, the only person on earth who made a shark scream with a camera...",The Last Starfighter
15,Aaron1375,A bit of work in a couple of areas and this could have been a really great film.,7,10 December 2009,"This film has some great moments in it...most of these moments have nothing to do with the battles though. This film could have been something really special, but it fails badly in a couple of places that would have really helped this film achieve legendary status. The story is good, a kid in a small town is really good at playing this game, one day doing so well he draws a crowd as he wins said game. Yes, you know it is a small town when playing a game brings such excitement to town. This game turns out to be a bit of a test that when passed you end up recruited by a space guy to become a star fighter. The characters in this one are great, the plot is actually rather good too and there are many funny scenes in this one. You also get to see the very attractive woman from the movie ""Night of the Comet"" and that one about the space ship. All this stuff that is right with the film, so what is wrong you ask? Well the fights involving the ships are not very good at all. The graphics are okay considering the time, but the space battles in movies such as those found in ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek II the Wrath of Kahn"" and even those in the show Battle Star Galactica are better than the weak fights in this one. That aside though this film is good and fun to watch. The scenes involving the replica are particularly funny and the one guy who recruits the young star fighter does a really good job in his role too. If only they had worked a bit more on making the space battles more memorable.",The Last Starfighter
16,Mr-Fusion,Stirs the adventurer in all of us,8,19 August 2014,"THE LAST STARFIGHTER's got all the good stuff: video games, spaceships, aliens, dogfights, the classic story of becoming a hero . . . it's the kind of movie that, if you go willingly, takes you right back to being a kid. That's not easy to pull off because if the material is shrewd and calculated, you can see that stuff coming from a mile away. It's artificial. But we've all felt stuck in nowheresville at one time in life, so we gamely join Alex on his journey into outer space. There's enough whimsy here to make it a fun ride. If that's not enough, he gets to actually be a starfighter and save planet Earth. The movie's shamelessly corny, but Lance Guest sells it to the rest of us. And it's pretty cool to see heavier hitters Dan O'Herlihy and Robert Preston (in a winking performance) have fun with it. The CGI, which could've gone woefully awry, works here and harks back to TRON (man, that'd be a killer double-bill). The Star Car is also a pretty bitchin' ride, and I also wouldn't mind having that arcade cabinet. Also wouldn't mind making it up to Catherine Mary Stewart at Silver Lake. 8/10",The Last Starfighter

18,Rainey-Dawn,Fun Sci-Fi Film,7,26 October 2014,"The Last Starfighter is a not a bad older science fiction movie - it's not a great film but it's fun. I was 12 when this movie came out and looking back now on this film I think is geared more for kids/teens and, maybe, a some science fiction fans, arcade video gaming addicts and comic book loving adults of the 1980's. This movie does have entertainment value if you are into older sci-fi flicks.Similar films to The Last Starfighter: 'Krull', 'Enemy Mine', 'Dune' 'Tron' and (in a way) 'Back to the Future'.I would rate this movie a 6/10 BUT there is a certain amount of nostalgic entertainment value I place on this movie so I have to rate the film a bit higher.7.5/10",The Last Starfighter
19,gridoon,Juvenile fantasy.,6,9 January 2001,"Basically kid stuff, although it may engage some adults occasionally. Variable special effects (the explosions look particularly unconvincing) but very good makeup. The scenes set on earth, with a robot that has taken the place of the hero while he is fighting for the protection of the universe, produce some charming moments - like the one where the robot ""fixes"" a problem with his ear or his attempts to flirt with the hero's girlfriend. The scenes set in space are less successful (even ""Moonraker"" had more impressive set design). And the basic story (despite beginning from a good premise) is silly; ""the frontier is about to collapse"" and ""we're under attack"" ? Who cares about that stuff anyway ?

20,Robert_duder,A poor man's Tron but it has it's fun side,6,4 April 2013,"I know I am seriously treading on people's childhood by writing this review. I must admit I had never even heard of The Last Starfighter before and I LOVE 80's fantasy movies. I was also surprised to see just how many people adore this movie. Nostalgia runs really high when it comes to this film and we all have movies from our childhood like that. The movie is good, but in my opinion falls short from being great. There are certain aspects of it that really succeed but it still feels like it tries just a little too hard and misses the mark in several aspects. One thing it does well is using its video game counterpart. If you really look at the arcade machine they use its quite impressive and actually well ahead of its time. The film does feel very rushed. Whereas most sci-fi/fantasy films will close in at a minimum of two hours, this one is a neat and tidy hour and a half and everything feels a little rushed. You don't get a chance to really appreciate the characters and they don't have time to endear themselves to you. My only other beef and this is a double edged sword because this was one of the first films to really utilize CGI in all of their special effects. That makes it a patriarch in its genre but also makes a lot of it look really cheesy and cartoonish.Lance Guest really is great in his role. He is the perfect 80's ""Marty McFly"" type hero that you can really relate to and enjoy his crazy adventure. Robert Preston is also very good in his very last role as alien recruiter Centauri. Preston and Guest have good chemistry and if the film had taken more time to really explore Centauri as a character and their relationship, it would have made it more enjoyable. Catherine Mary Stewart is, unfortunately for her, just really the eye candy of the film. She is cute and very ""girl next door"" and is strictly there to be a love interest to Guest. Chris Hebert is fun and does a great job as the little brother. This is another character left completely unexplored and underused. Dan O'Herlihy plays Grig, our co-hero who is also an Alien. This is another character that tries so hard to endear themselves to you but the script and the timing doesn't give them enough. The scenes with O'Herlihy and Guest are fun! There simply isn't enough of them. Norman Snow is decent as the evil villain Xur. And yet much like nearly every other character he has very little development. You must have a HUGE villain in this type of movie. Something we can really sink in to but it never happens and that's unfortunate.Nick Castle is not a director who has had a ton of experience, especially when he did this one. I think perhaps that might play a part in the film not being as HUGE as it could have been. Still the movie is fun and has its moments of genuine enjoyment. Some of the special effects when its not being entirely ""animated"" are really well done. The ship landing in the trailer park at the end was just very cool to watch. Lance Guest gives us a fun ""everyday"" hero and really does make the film that much better with his performance. Sometimes you love a movie because you grew up with it, it holds nostalgia for you and so it will always be a 10 in your books. This wasn't a movie I had ever heard of so I am reviewing it strictly on the merit of entertainment and how it holds up to today. Its good but far from great considering it came out in a time with such superior sci/fi fantasy epics. 6/10",The Last Starfighter
21,ericstevenson,Loved the ending!,8,21 February 2018,"I'm going to admit right now that this isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it's still quite fun. I knew little about it except that it's plot was alluded to in the ""South Park"" episode ""Best Friends Forever"". It features a guy who gets the highest score in a video game, only to find out that the game was a test created by aliens to recruit people from all over the Universe to use starships to fight. Okay, I admit the premise is pretty goofy, but it's still a standard film. The makeup effects are quite good. This was in the very early days of CGI, so I can understand that those bits don't hold up well. The guy is replaced on Earth by a robot duplicate who meets up with his girlfriend, Maggie. The ending is really one of the most heartwarming I've seen in a long time. He goes back to Earth after finding out that they need him in space to rebuild the fleet. He decides he at least wants his girlfriend to join him on his adventures and eventually she goes. Honestly, these are some very heartfelt scenes and they more than make up for slower bits in the movie. I love how they set up the story to continue too. ***",The Last Starfighter

24,paulclaassen,"Yes, this was entertaining.",5,17 February 2020,"Back in the 80s, the use of models and practical effects were common. This must have been a challenge for directors attempting to make it as realistic as possible in a time before CGI. For most part, they did a very good job with 'The Last Starfighter'.The effects are obviously dated by today's standards and the new generation might not appreciate the film, or even find the effects laughable. If you can transport yourself back around four decades, you'd understand how great this must have looked back then. The film also has great costumes and make-up.This is an interesting action adventure fantasy to pass the time on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It also weaves humor and romance into the action and fantasy, making it a good choice for a family movie. It wasn't fantastic, but it was entertaining enough.",The Last Starfighter

27,hellraiser7,Wing Commander,9,19 July 2012,"I was a kid from the 80's I love both sci-fi and video games, just seeing the combination of both of them was a dream come true for me, because this film was practically the best of both worlds.Yeah this is another under the radar gem from the 80's I'm fond of and was part of my childhood. It's true it's not a deep sci-fi, it's not trying to be but it's really just a simple wish fulfillment fantasy and there's nothing wrong with that I like those kinds of stories because their built to make you feel good and that anything is possible. These kinds of stories and films I don't see much anymore, which to me is part of what makes the film special. But I just love the idea that a video game is actually a test to join an organization to stop an intergalactic threat, that's cool. It's like if the video games ""Halo"", ""Mass Effect"" did the same thing heck may'be ""Double Dragon"" where that's a test to join some ninja organization to stop a crime wave, well you get the idea.I love the score for the movie, the theme song is one of my favorite themes ever, it has just that epic heroic tune to it. The special effects are great, from the make up work on the aliens, the practical sets of the interiors of the starships as well as the designs of them. But the best effect of all was the CGI, this film was the second along with the film ""Tron"" to combine both live action with CGI. I still think it's holds up rather well (at least I think so) because you really sense the effort and care they put into the production, I feel this is one of the best examples of CGI as well as big budget and effects in general used the right way for the right reasons.I really like the design of the Starfighter, just seeing how it worked made me want to drive one. The best feature for me was the death blossom, it kind reminds me of most of those shooter games like ""Raiden"" just when your ship is overwhelmed with opposition your simply nuke them as a quick solution.Another use of the CGI was in the Starfighter arcade game literally made. The film wasn't just groundbreaking and ahead of it's time in the effects dept but also in development and design of video games. Just seeing that game Alex was playing blew me away because at the time I've never seen video games look anything like that and really made me wish that the video game existed, they actually tried but it didn't happen.My favorite moment with the video game was when almost everyone in the trailer park was seeing Alex beat the game and their all getting excited. It reminds me of the crowds getting excited in those video game tournaments in conventions. Yeah I know small victory to cheer for but small victories I always believed were good signs that added up to big victories in the future.I really like the cast from the supporting characters like the late great Dan O Heiliy whom plays the lovable Greg, like the make up work on him sort of an evolved reptilian only pleasant looking. As well as the late great Robert Preston as Centari he puts on that same silver tongued persona he usually plays but it's just fun and funny to hear because just the speed and execution of his deliver is music to my ears.But it's really two of the main characters that drive the film. Catherine Mary Stewart whom was one of the first actresses I had a crush on as a kid, she's hot and a capable actress it's a shame she didn't get more stand out projects. But anyway like her character Maggie she a solid significant other, a typical girl likes having fun, supportive, but she is insecure in some way because she does desire more like Alex but is unfortunately reluctant to leave.Lance Guest is great as Alex, shame this actor also didn't have more. I really like Alex, the character is a lot like myself when I was his age. He's kinda a geek, I mean that in a good way. He likes sci-fi and video games, he has desire to leave his neighborhood and have an adventure. But he's also kinda an underdog, he's a kid that really isn't with the popular crowd, he's not rich, and he doesn't have the best luck from his responsibilities to deal with that really cut into time with both friends and girlfriend, but also having trouble getting into a good collage that to him is his ticket out of town. You really want this guy to get everything he deserves and he gets them in more ways than one. I really like how he reacts once he shipped into space it feels like how anyone would react, he's reluctant at playing the starfighter role at first because it wasn't exactly what he had in mind at first but it grows on him as things go on and it's believable it's sort of the rite of passage principle.The only miss of the film for me is the subplot with the fake Alex, that by it's nature I felt was filler and some of the humor in it doesn't really work. But this is a small miss, there's really not many minutes of it so it flies by.""The Last Starfighter"" it's not a masterpiece but all the same it's a lot of fun because it has the rocket power, fuel, and heart to make it fly high.Rating: 3 and a half stars",The Last Starfighter
28,strong-122-478885,Alex Rogan's Simuloid Beta Unit Comes To Earth,3,20 May 2015,"OK. If this were 1984 (the year of The Last Starfighter's theatrical release), you can be sure that I'd most likely be raving about this Sci-Fi/Comedy, kiddies' film with a little bit more enthusiasm. And, yes, rating it with a higher score than just 3 measly stars, as well.But, as things stand - Now 30 years later (after being thoroughly saturated for the past 3 decades by an onslaught of CGI effects in every single alien-related movie around), one can't help but see how totally inferior The Last Starfighter is in so many, many ways.Had I been able to somehow relate to the youthful characters in the story, I might have leaned a little less critically on this film, which I view as a blatant rip-off of Star Wars.But, as it stood - The Last Starfighter's story was a pretty well-worn tale that held no surprises and quickly got stale within its first half-hour.Yes. I will admit that some of the visual effects here were quite good - But this didn't come anywhere near to compensating for the rest of The Last Starfighter which, pretty much, sucked to infinity, and beyond.",The Last Starfighter

It wasn't like some of the truly bad stuff, like anything produced by Roger Corman or Glen Larsen at the time. This was just kind of harmless.All that said, the movie has a fun premise, some engaging characters. What doesn't hold up are the special effects. This was one of the first movies that held that computer generated graphics could be a replacement for the old ""Green Screen and model"" method of spaceship filming, but they were probably about a decade too early. One would also notice that the ""Gunstars"" bear an uncanny resemblance to Babylon 5 Star Furies, but I digress.",The Last Starfighter
30,drqshadow-reviews,Time Capsule to a Simpler Era,6,17 June 2011,"This was playing on a nearly continuous loop throughout a better part of my childhood, but as I hadn't seen it in over two decades, I was basically watching it again for the first time. It doesn't hold up magnificently and bows to a huge number of clichés from the decade's pop-friendly films, but still retains a strong sense of endearing sincerity and naiveté. The back of my mind kept reminding me of how terribly hackneyed the story and characters were, but that wasn't enough to wipe the stars out of my eyes nor the grin from my face. It's a staggeringly rudimentary plot - teen going nowhere in life gets a high score in a video game, only to learn it was a secret recruiting tool for an intergalactic war - but a thorough coating in childlike whimsy and wonder, plus a few startlingly good special effects (given the era) are just enough to pull it back from the brink. Anyone younger than twenty will likely roll their eyes and snort at its simplicity, but audiences with a memory of the eighties should enjoy it for the sentimentality alone.",The Last Starfighter
31,XweAponX,The Father of all CGI movies,10,25 January 2009,"If you run through the end credits you will see names like Jeffery Okun (Independence Day) and Jim Rygiel (Lord of the Rings and Starship Troopers) as well as several other people for whom this might have been their first film- It is certainly the first feature length film with a lot of CGI... Considering that the Macintosh had not even been invented yet, and the only PC was the IBM PC/XT, it is an incredible feat of CGI for the time, this was a time when ""computer"" did not mean a PC with XP or Vista installed, it meant a Box with Plugs, and you had to buy peripherals and hook them up, and some computers did not even have a monitor, the Printers just echoed what you typed on the keyboard- Hence the term in a DOS ""Autoexec.Bat"" file- ""Echo On"" which was the command to tell the PC to ""print"" what you typed onto the printer, which was likely a huge Dot-matrix monstrosity.When you think of the State of the Art in 1983 and the SOA Now... It is amazing that the special effects department ever was able to get this done. At that time, there were not even any Hard Disk Drives for storage medium. So it is not surprising at all that they had to borrow a Cray for this.This is a very fine film... I rented it from Von's back in 1984 on a beta tape and watched it with my mom, and she liked it as well. She really liked the characters of Grig and Centauri.Just to make a comment here about the look of the ""aliens"" - Which look like Minbari from Babylon-5. But if you look close, you can virtually detect pieces of set that ended up in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, and in Star Trek: The Next Generatiion. I refer to the Table on the Command ship around which the commanders are clustered, and also, in the Starfighter base, there is a little gizmo that lies on it's side, with two long glass tubes through which Ruby laser is being fed- This was part of Beverly Crusher's Apparatus on the Enterprise D. So in a way, if this film had not been made, a lot of the look of some of the places in ST:TNG would have been different, including Engineering in ST:TNG, which ended up with that Table from the Command Ship. I would know those set pieces anywhere... And if anyone has seen ""Bladerunner: Dangerous Days"" They would see that indeed, lots of pieces made for other films end up in unlikely places, and in Bladerunner, whenever the Spinners fly over a city scene, if you look carefully you can see, The Millennium Falcon, pointed upright.The non-cgi parts of this story are filmed just as well as any of the scifi fare of the day... The only weakness in my opinion is the blending of the CGI shots to the filmed stock. It is amazing the the CGI work was done on a Cray Supercomputer- And it is far from the hero work on LOTR, King Kong, Iron Man... But for its time, it was great. I remember when I first saw it, I actually liked the look... If you think about it, the stark CGI look of the starfighters, and the Frontier, and the base, and the command ship: It is all very much like a video game, and so this fits in very well with the plot of an alien man parking a ""Starfighter Test"" disguised as a video game in a trailer park in order to find Starfighters for this little episode.It is as if Alex's whole POV is as if the video game has been expanded to a much larger scale. I immensely enjoyed the ""Death Blossom"" gag, it had humor and class. The HUD probably was influential for games like Descent Freespace and Mech Warrior 2.The idea of having a personal robot to take ones place in uncomfortable circumstances is explored in this film, much to Alex's chagrin with his girlfriend.I find the character actors in this well chosen, including Meg Wylie (One of the Talosians from the Pilot Star Trek Episode ""The Cage"") as Maggie's Grandmother, who at the end of the film gives a kind of ""Salute"" from Trek to Starfighter- Of you look close for it.It would please me, and a large amount of fans no end to have a new ""Special Effects"" version of this film where the CGI could be run through a few things to give it a bit more realism, but that may spoil the FPS (First Person Shooter) effect of the film.",The Last Starfighter
32,kirbylee70-599-526179,SAVING THE GALAXY VIA ARCADE,9,21 December 2020,"In 1984 a new phase in film making special effects was well on its way to dominance. The invention was using the computer to create images and effects in ways never before imagined. While today's movies almost all feature some form of CGI (computer generated images), in 1984 we were just stepping into that world. No film better displayed that then THE LAST STARFIGHTER.Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) feels like he has no hope of going anywhere. Living with his mother running a trailer court, Alex is the handy man there. The people living in this court though are more family than clients. Alex dream is to go to college and move away, taking his longtime girlfriend Maggie (Catherine Mary-Stewart) with him. But things don't go as planned and his application for a loan for school is denied.Alex finds solace in one item at the court, an arcade game called Starfighter. He's been hitting the top scores on the game and one night he begins to achieve the impossible, beating the game. As the trailer park denizens cheer him on he beats the game and all go home singing his praises. Left standing alone at the game a futuristic car pulls up and the driver, Centauri (Robert Preston), gets out to congratulate him. He offers to take him for a ride in his car for winning but has more in store than Alex bargained for.It seems that Centauri is actually an alien and he created the game to recruit potential warriors to help battle an evil that is spread across the universe. This conflict between the Rylan Star League and the Ko-Dan Empire, the same depicted on the game, is real. The Ko-Dan Empire is on the move aided by a traitor from the Rylan Star League. Now the newly appointed Starfighters are the last thing to stand between them and annihilation.But Alex wants none of it. For him it was nothing more than a simple arcade game. Centauri takes him back home and lets him know that he will only fulfill his dreams if he chooses to take a step forward rather than sit in the trailer park for the rest of his life. Alex finally agrees and they return to the base only to find the Starfighters have all been wiped out. The only one left is Alex and his pilot Grig (Dan O'Herlihy). Now they set off to defend the Universe and save it from being completely overrun by the K-Dan Empire.What amazed me while watching this film was to see how fantastically it has stood up to time. It still presents a great story, special effects and a hero for the times. The acting is above par for a movie of this sort, more often limited to Z-grade performances and direction. Here every member of the cast is allowed to shine, especially Preston in what was to be his last feature film performance. Director Nick Castle, who actually starred as Michael Myers in the first of the HALLOWEEN films, went on to direct movies like THE BOY WHO COULD FLY, TAP, DENNIS THE MENACE and MAJOR PAYNE.There is a sense of wonder to this film, that joyous feeling one gets when seeing the fantastic explode before their eyes. Watching it I wondered how youngsters seeing it for the first time back in 1984 were probably marveling at what they were seeing and wanting to join forces as a Starfighter. I though I wonder if my great great nephews would get as much out of this film as those youngsters did having grown up with the modern CGI there is today. I know I'll have to find out soon.Arrow Video is releasing the film and as tired as you might be of my saying it they have done an amazing job here starting with a brand new restoration from a 4K scan of the original 35mm camera negative. And for a movie this old the amount of extras they are including is phenomenal. They include a new audio commentary with Guest and his son Jackson Guest, a new commentary with Mike White of The Projection Booth podcast, an archival commentary with Castle and production designer Ron Cobb, MAGGIE'S MEMORIES: REVISITING THE LAST STARFIGHTER a new interview with Catherine Mary Stewart, INTO THE STARSCAPE: COMPOSING THE LAST STARFIGHTER an interview with composer Craig Safan, INCREDIBLE ODDS: WRITING THE LAST STARFIGHTER a new interview with screenwriter Jonathan Betuel, INTERSTELLA HIT-BEST: CREATING SPECIAL EFFECTS a new interview with special effects supervisor Kevin Pike, EXCALIBUR TEST: INSIDE DIGITAL PRODUCTIONS a new interview with sci-fi author Greg Bear on Digital Productions the company responsible for the CGI on the film, GREETINGS STARFIGHTER!

33,gcd70,Cartoon Adventure is Routine,4,4 February 2010,"""Cartoon"" adventure finds average kid Alex Rogan recruited to defend the galaxy against a sinister invasion after acing a video game in his trailer park.Off the back of the Star Wars saga and many other sci-fi flicks, this yarn only makes the grade for the kiddies. The special effects are no great shakes, the space scenes having been unconvincingly computer generated. Even the f/x in Star Wars were superior, some seven years earlier.Jonathan Beteul's script is strictly routine hero stuff, and Nick Castle turns it into the best piece of entertainment he can. Lance Guest plays your typical high school kid made good, and he's a dead-ringer for Kirk Cameron. Guest disappeared fairly quickly after this one though. Other support comes from Catherine Mary Stewart as girlfriend Maggie and Robert Preston as the omnipotent Centauri. Craig Safan provides the heroic score.Tuesday, July 21, 1998 - Video",The Last Starfighter
34,bkrauser-81-311064,A Fun but Forgetful Star Wars Clone,7,6 December 2013,"The concept for The Last Starfighter (1984) is so stupidly simple, I can imagine the writer pitching the idea to producers resulting in a bidding war. The story follows a teen named Alex (Lance Guest) who after beating an all-time record on an arcade game gets a chance to do it all for real. It's nice to think every time you win a video game there might be someone out there looking for your exact qualifications for kicking ass and taking names.One thing I immediately noticed during the movie was the presence of The Music Man (1962) himself Robert Preston as Alex's recruiter Centauri. When he is first introduced you can barely make out his face but his voice, at least to me, is unmistakable. His speech has a rhythmic pattern to it that resembles an amiable used car salesman. I honestly hoped he would start rambling the words to ""Ya Got Trouble"" as a form of fan service to me and me alone. It also didn't help that he was sporting a beige suit with a red bow tie.Overall The Last Starfighter is a pleasant if forgetful flick. As a stand alone it's an okay movie though as a Star Wars (1977) clone with WarGames (1983) undertones it pales in comparison. I would recommend instead of watching The Last Starfighter, going home and hugging your Star Wars collection. If you don't have one, get one and watch them again. Especially if you have the original cuts.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",The Last Starfighter
35,mike48128,Came out 8 years too late! A Classic Cheesy-Fun Space Movie!,9,25 November 2015,"Lost in the summer releases and technically very inferior to the ""Star Wars"" series, but a lot of fun. The digital effects are crude. The spaceship matte is very inferior and fake-looking by today's standards. What does it have in it's favor? Several things: It has a great intentional sense-of-humor. (You will notice this more on the 2nd viewing.) The villain is a spoiled brat that looks like a bald Kryptonian. He bombs the space academy while the spacesuit-tailors are arguing about modifying the uniform for ""humans""! Great intentional ""miscasting"" with a green lizard man (nice rubber suit) and Robert Preston plays himself as a Harold Hill-alien ""flim-flam man"". Great low budget special effects and some of it takes place on Earth in a boring trailer park! The alien assassin smells like a rotten pork chop and disguises itself as a policeman-shape-shifter! Lot's of fun. Our hero, played by Lance Guest, (Alex) is a teenaged college student with a very-hot girl friend (Catherine Mary Stewart). ""Alex"" plays ""the video game"" at the trailer court. The game was shipped there by mistake! It was meant to go to another city or planet! By beating the game, he qualifies to become a space cadet and gets recruited by Robert Preston as ""Centuri"". Other nice touches: Alex (the Starfighter) is ""replaced"" temporarily by a ""Beta Unit"" drone. It takes off its head to adjust itself after taking a ""tongue in the ear"" by his girlfriend! The ""Star Car"" changes into a ""Space-Car"" just like in ""The Men in Black"". As I explained, it's intentionally humorous and will be enjoyed much more if you view it that way. Why else would the ""Space Blossom"" ultimate super-missile weapon be powered by a 9-volt battery? One of my own guilty pleasures. My 9 year-old grandson absolutely loved it , and he has seen all the Star Wars movies!",The Last Starfighter
36,stamper,"Well how about that ?, only POSITIVE comments...",5,12 July 2000,"Actually I wasn't even going to write a comment on this one, a waste of words I felt, cause the grade here 6 point something proved my point. This is not a film believed to be great by a large number of people. But then I read the comments section and I saw about 2 to 4 negative comments out of 29 and I thought what the f (I'd rather not specify that thought any further). How can you like this film???? I mean when you are anything from 4 to 10 I might see why you liked it, by all means I LOVED E.T. when I was about that age and I liked The Neverending Story but later I had to change my views. They are kids movies as is this one. So here is a comment for all people exceeding that child - age.You really can't like this one unless you are insane or really just a big child, because this flick really only has two good things in it, well 2 and a half. First of all there are some pretty good creatures here, they look pretty nice (some of them), like that Alien friend of the Last Starfighter and the evil guys. No not that ludicrous idiot with the bold head. What the hell are those guys supposed to be anyhow. Second of all I felt the rather short scenes with the beta unit were rather funny and third of all I thought the music was pretty good (although it reminded me of Indiana Jones (RIP - OFF???))Well there certainly are major rip - off' s in this film, some of the creatures look like inspired by Star Wars, the clothes look like Battlestar Galactica, the fighting scenes look like (again) Star Wars and the music (well I already covered it and I'm not sure so I'll keep my mouth shut). Well that' s it actually. Now we come to the story, I'm looking for a word here eh..limp...loser...lame!!!! That' s it LAME.  It really makes no sense at times, everyone dies, when the base is COMPLETELY destroyed (half of it is still there), except that Alien friend of the Last Starfighter. All that is left is one battle - ship, but its a PROTOTYPE (that's original) and the boy does not want to save the world. Well he wanted some adventure, but this seems to be not adventurous enough. Well for the rest this piece of crap has got special effects that are, how do I put it, constantly there. In other words I couldn't get it out of my mind, these are effects, that's not what happens, they are far from realistic. The space ship' s look like they have been ripped out of a computer game (an expensive one though) and the explosions are crap!!!, I could do better with a match and some firecrackers. Also I found the name for the beta unit rather imaginative, they are called simuloids, how did he come up with it, I mean, the robot simulates to be another being and from there to simuloids, MAN, that' s a long way. I'm probably a reviloid (as in review) or  a commeloid (as in comment), I know it doesn't sound as good as simuloid, but hey I only had a second to figure it out. I guess the writer must have taken days.The cast is also merely so - so, so that is why we never saw one of these passable faces in a blockbuster you say, that' s right, producers probably thought the actors sucked ALSO!!!Well this was not total crap but I would not watch it again, even if I had nothing else to do and was bored out of my mind. Still considering it as a kid' s movie I have to admit I've seen poorer ones and if you're a kid you might like it:I give it a mild 5 out of 10",The Last Starfighter
37,rebeljenn,a 1980s Star Wars kids fantasy,3,10 January 2006,"'The Last Starfighter' is a film for children made in the early 1980s which copies off of the successful 'Star Wars' trilogy. The star of the film is a young man who is very good at playing video games, and since he is good at the game, he is recruited to defend the galaxy. This has got to be every child's dream at one point after watching 'Star Wars', so I am not surprised that this film was produced for those of us who enjoyed the 'Star Wars' movies. Although I enjoyed the 'Star Wars' films, I did not enjoy this film, and the last time that I saw it, I must have been close to 15-years-old. It's a little bit of a juvenile film, and I do not think adults will enjoy it unless they had fond memories of it from the 1980s.",The Last Starfighter

39,cariart,"Sweet, Exciting Science Fiction Adventure!",9,16 November 2000,"A combination of 'Coming-of-Age', 'Small-town U.S.A.', and Science Fiction films, 'The Last Starfighter' is one of that rare breed of films that actually become more enjoyable after repeated viewings!Famous in film history as the first film to utilize computer-generated FX for its space scenes (producing a 'big-budget' look to more modestly budgeted film), the effects today seem as creaky and out-of-date as the 'Last Starfighter' arcade game that teenager Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) is so expert at! Don't let this put you off, though, as this story is really about the youngster, and being willing to take advantage of an opportunity to 'shine', as Otis (Vernon Washington), his best friend at his trailer park home, reminds him.The concept of the game being a secret test for fighter pilots is clever, and when game creator Robert Preston (who is magnificent, in his last screen appearance) whisks young Rogan off to fight in an interstellar war, all of the youngster's long-stated ambitions to leave home and make something of his life are tested. In a series of amusing scenes, our hero stumbles through his first encounter with alien races, meeting the affable Grig (an unrecognizable Dan O'Herlihy, who nearly steals the movie), the pilot of his fightercraft. A truly cosmic adventure is about to begin!Guest is terrific as Alex, conveying both the humor and frustration of growing up in the trailer park; Catherine Mary Stewart, as his girlfriend, is equally good! As Alex' space-fixated younger brother, Louis, Chris Hebert has some of the film's funniest lines, and the image of him, taking his shot at the arcade game and a chance to become a Starfighter, is actually moving!Special praise should be given to Craig Safan's rousing score, some of the most beautiful, sweeping music since 'Star Wars'!'The Last Starfighter' has achieved near-cult film status over the years, and is a rich experience you'll enjoy, again and again! I STRONGLY recommend it!",The Last Starfighter
40,raypdaley182,So important for so many reasons!,7,5 March 2006,"There may not be any big names in this film. A few of the cast go onto bigger things. All the budget for this film went on a totally new idea. Something that would go on to become a standard term in science fiction films. CGI - Computer Generated Imagery. All the spaceships, planets, stars and meteors are all computer generated.No-one had ever done anything like this before. All the images were generated by the Cray 2 super computer. The only other people using this computer at the time were NASA. The main thing that let the fantastic computer visuals down were the very bad practical explosions.Centauri's car (a poorly disguised De Lorean) which seems to be much bigger inside than outside, stealing an idea from Doctor Who. Admittedly this film does borrow heavily from things like Star Wars, but all films were borrowing from Star Wars back then.I would be interested to know how Wil Wheaton fitted into this film, all his scenes are cut. The Starfighter arcade game features a nicely disguised Atari symbol on the side of the cabinet.I do like the scenes with the Beta Unit, learning how to become Alex.The plot as such is thin on the ground, but all in all the film is something you watch just to kick back and kill some time.Enjoy this and realize without this movie things like Toy Story, Shark Tale, A bugs life would never exist.A piece of movie history to watch and enjoy.Overdue a remake or sequel.",The Last Starfighter
41,grendelkhan,An 80's sci-fi movie that is a throwback to the 30's.,7,7 September 2006,"I loved the Last Starfighter since I first saw it in the theater. It was a highly entertaining film, with great effects (for the time). The story was a bit of a throwback to early space opera, like Doc Smith's Skylark and Lensmen sagas; a young man must save the galaxy from an evil horde. The addition of the video game, an homage to King Arthur, gave it a nice twist.The film is well written, with liberal doses of humor, as well as exciting adventure. Lance Guest is fine as the young hero, Alex, although his range is a bit limited. It's the supporting actors who really make the film. Robert Preston steals the movie the moment he enters the frame, basically replaying his character from the Music Man. Preston was the best charming con man in film. Dan O'Herlihy is equally good as Grigg, mentor and navigator for Alex.The film has everything space opera needs: a plucky hero, a wise mentor, evil villains, and heroic space battles. The use of early CGI made the film stand out at the time, but looks very dated now. At the time, the graphics were quite advanced and the ship battles were very exciting, though not on par with the Star Wars films. The CGI tied it in well with the video game concept.Although the film looks rather dated, the story still holds up and the supporting characters are far better than recent examples. It still is vastly more entertaining than recent space opera films (Star Wars prequels) and a lot of fun for the whole family. The relationship between Alex and Maggie is quite believable, as is that mentor-student relationships with Centauri and Grigg. The design work was excellent, and still holds up. Definitely worth a look.",The Last Starfighter
42,Space_Mafune,Juvenile Space Opera Fun,7,19 August 2003,"This video game/ STAR WARS inspired space opera epic is more fun than it probably has any right to be. While there is an instant or two where the film suffers greatly from a case of the ""cutes"", the great casting here makes this one remain worthwhile. In particular Dan O' Herlihy, with his performance as Alex Rogan's alien friend Grig, absolutely steals this movie and gets to deliver most of the best lines. And when he's not stealing the picture, another veteran character actor named Robert Preston (Centauri) is. Good stuff especially suitable for teenage sci-fi fans but even as an adult I cannot help but have a soft spot for this cast...even Lance Guest and Catherine Mary Stuart do alright here.",The Last Starfighter
43,DavidSim240183,Move over Star Wars!,9,15 July 2007,"The opening credits of The Last Starfighter leave trails of light in a background of stars. As I was watching it, I couldn't shake the fact that it reminded me of the opening for Superman. And even the theme music sounds like it was composed by John Williams. I don't mean any of this to sound like a criticism, but you might be forgiven for thinking TLS is more than a tad derivative.And when the plot is a boy whisked away to the stars to fight against an oppressive empire out to conquer the galaxy, Star Wars will definitely be the next film to cross your mind. But The Last Starfighter is not a carbon copy, but rather puts an ingenious twist on the same scenario.The boy in question, Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) is an avid video gamer. He is a young man who dreams of moving away from the trailer park he seems stuck in, and gets frustrated at every turn. One night, he breaks the top score on his favourite arcade game, Starfighter. And when he does, a man called Centauri (Robert Preston) arrives in a flying car, takes Alex into space, and drafts him into the Star League as a Starfighter pilot.The Last Starfighter is not the ripoff of Star Wars it easily seems to be. The whole video game angle is what gives it whole new dimensions. Alex's time as a Starfighter is almost treated like one gigantic video game.TLS was one of the first films to use wholly computer generated imagery, and the technology has allowed the filmmakers to create fleets of ships in perfect clarity. Maybe a little too perfect. When I watch the film, I can tell that a lot of the ships being created are nothing more than something dreamt up on a computer. They look too crystallised. But maybe that's the point. Since the film is grounded in the surroundings of a video game, what we see resembles one. And it has to be said, some of the space battles are quite dazzling on the eyes.The film is pure wish-fulfilment fantasy. But I thought the idea of arcade machines being placed on Earth by aliens as testing devices for potential Starfighter recruits was rather clever, and its the ingenuity of this conceit that allows TLS to entertain as strongly as it does.Directed by Nick Castle, he is a filmmaker who never really went on to a rich film career. Aside from this film and his next one, the underrated The Boy Who Could Fly, none of his other films are particularly memorable. But with this one, he shows a lightness of touch and a real dexterity when it comes to narrative structure. Something he would repeat with TBWCF.A lot of the characterisations are warm and believable (except for the whole trailer park being video game addicts). Lance Guest is OK in the part of Alex, even if he doesn't really stand out. He pulls double-duty as Beta-Alex, a robot meant to take his place on Earth while Alex is out saving the galaxy. And he's far funnier in this role. Misunderstanding the human culture, and he doesn't like it when Alex's girlfriend puts her tongue in his ear. Shocking!More successful are the supporting cast in space. Robert Preston brings a likable affability to Centauri, and drives a car that looks suspiciously like the time machine from Back to the Future (But since TLS was made first, did BTTF rip off that idea? It's an intriguing notion to consider!). His character arc didn't need a return from the dead cliché though.But the star performer of the whole film is Dan O'Herlihy as Grig, Alex's co-pilot who shows him the ropes. He's an intensely likable character, and although buried in makeup, his voice alone allows his endearing personality to shine through warm and bright. Alex and Grig are amusing together, and one wishes the film were built up more around their friendship.The Last Starfighter is played more or less tongue in cheek, which prevents things from getting too silly. And although I wasn't always convinced that Alex beats such insurmountable odds, it's much too enjoyable a film to be discarded. Castle's direction is slick and engaging. There are plenty of space dogfights to enjoy. And there's quite a wide variety of special effects, makeup work and impressive set designs to feast upon.An overlooked film well worthy of reappraisal.",The Last Starfighter
44,rooee,Mobile Home of Courage,5,6 January 2013,"The success of The Last Starfighter must have seemed nailed on at the time: The frontiers-and-federations intrigue of Star Wars; the spectacular CG of Tron; and the cosy small town backdrop of Close Encounters and E.T. The problem is that it doesn't perform brilliantly on any of these fronts. The plot is video game flimsy, a tracing paper copy of Lucas's rich mythopoeia. The CG is cripplingly dated because, unlike Tron's virtual world, it unwisely attempts to depict real objects and environments. And the community is populated not so much by characters as an idiosyncratic audience with a strange fascination with arcade game high scores.And yet, despite its flaws (and perhaps partly because of them) the film is quite charming. Lance Guest is well cast as the reluctant hero (and his bumbling clone, Beta), a gamer who dreams of magnificence in the midst of a mundane world. Impatient to make a difference and assert his existence, Alex's addiction to the Starfighter game, with its instant rewards, is a plausible escape. And the audience isn't left out of the equation - our own childish fantasies of virtual playtime having tangible relevance is exploited to the full. If it can happen to trailer kid, it can happen to anyone.There is poignant mentoring from Robert Preston as the eager old rogue Centauri, and solid support from Dan O'Herlihy (light years from his satirical presence as The Old Man in Robocop) playing Grigg, reminiscent of Louis Gossett Jr's Jerry in Enemy Mine. And underneath the dialogue, or blasting over it, the score is a mishmash of themes from other movies of the era, recalling the work of James Horner and Jerry Goldsmith, and is appropriately stirring for it.The Last Starfighter makes for a decent companion piece alongside other mid-80s spacefaring childhood fare, such as Flight of the Navigator and Explorers, in which the imagination of children is rewarded by being made into reality. The decline of the arcade machine and improvements in CGI date the film, but also lock it in time as a sweet-natured relic from another era, another galaxy.",The Last Starfighter

49,r-c-s,nice futuristic teen sci-fi 1980s movie,8,21 June 2007,"Era and genre-wise this is a very nice movie. It is futuristic in its (ab)use of CGI ( or what it was in 1984 ) and has blazed a trail for many later movies of much bigger renown and success. The plot is a truckload of clichés, but that doesn't detract from the charm, but contributes to it because of the openness of the move ( these are not clichés pretending to be something new ). We get a teenage kid in trailer park who's a charming loser, and his belle who sticks with him despite the attention of the local bully sporting a new truck...these stereotypes can be hardly ""casual"". The kid has hardly a life ( does he helps his mother operate the trailer camp? ) and his application for a bursary is rejected, as a plus...so the highest thrill in his life is playing the ONLY typical 1980s arcade video game, and getting very good at it. Now some criticize the above as a pile of junk, but i think it was DELIBERATE. This movie hasn't the ""philosophical"" pretensions of a Matrix ( and if one goes watching a movie like Matrix for its philosophical value, well... ) and no psycho-tirade ala star wars-Anakin ( who the hell cares? If i want real psycho movies i get Hitchcock or Pialat or...not Star Wars ), but well...this is why one went watching movies like this, right? Relax and unpretentious fun. The plot is paper thin, but it's easily watchable and subplots don't hog too much screen time. Of course in real life no way the cutie in town would stick with the trailer camp loser if she had better chances...and the bully in town would just forgive you for ramming his new truck into an alien spaceship...teenagers are impersonated by people in their mid 20s, but it's a movie, right? This movie belongs to the row of juvenile escapist movies...a youngster in sub par conditions dreams and for once his dream comes true to an unexpected magnitude. If we weren't gods or millionaires, we would dream at times like that; of course only in a movie does the dream come true. Acting is fair and Preston is good in the ""used car salesman from space"" role.",The Last Starfighter

The Last Starfighter is a great example except it isn't corny.Some people are complaining about the visual effects but let me tell ya, they are pretty good even by today's standards. Some of these effects snobs think that if a movie's effects aren't groundbreaking or super realistic, they aren't good. Special effects are effective if they enhance a movie, not just because they use the latest computer effects or bring something entirely new to the movie world. Anyway, back to the movie.The cast all does a good job but none of them ever went on to fame, a occurance that I blame solely on soulless Hollywood execs. Lance Guest especially, come on he did a good job. He deserves better. The plot is simple but fun and this movie is perfect for kids, as I was at the time I saw this the first thru 300th time.

56,charlessmith702210,"Some of the space battles are as great as what was in ""Star Wars""",8,3 March 2008,"Indirectly, this is a movie on how a video game fanatic, Alex, who loves ""The Last Starfighter"" video game, and masters that video game all the way up to the most difficult level, gets caught up in the exciting fantasy of being sent into space by a special recruiter named Centauri.From there, Alex is said to be recruited to fight against the Kodan Armada, with its main evil leader, Zur, when Centauri's frontier's main attack by the Kodan Armada destroys and kills all of the remaining starfighters...except Alex....and a monster-friend who was slightly bigger than him...called Grigg. From there, the ""Starfighter"" game would not be a video game....this is the real deal, where one wrong hit at an enemy target or other mistake can mean death for the good starfighter...even a starfighter as good as Alex. Like ""Star Wars episode V"", there is evidence of a clone. This episode of Star Wars had evidence of a ""probe droid""; the ""Starfighter"" flick had a beta unit that featured another Alex as a clone, which was very slightly like a probe droid. However...the results in ""Starfighter"" were much less gory than even the character Ash in ""Alien"", who turned from a simple person into a evil robot with lots of blood.As Alex and Grigg go up to the starfighter ship and as Grigg mentions the intricacies of the fighter ship, Alex learns extremely quickly that this was similar to the video game he played down on earth....from the target scopes to the several types of main weaponry, such as guided missiles and lasers.There was a special weapon called the MIRV--which was used for the first time by the good fighter ship against the main command ship containing the evil Zur. It is actually a missile that breaks up into four smaller missiles that rush to the target, almost like a cluster bomb does.Well, the video game down on earth did not mention anything about ""death blossom"", but when this was mentioned on the real starfighter ship Alex and Grigg were using on the Frontier, I realized that this weapon consisted of multi-directional lasers on 4 wings of the fighter ship, with about 50 laser muzzles per wing. When death blossom was released, those on the ship were in for a rough ride similar to bumper cars, as the ""blossom"" spurts deadly laser fire in all directions almost in a haphazard fashion, but still destroying any close enemy target appearing in its path....and the kill zone for death blossom is a 100-yard radius....just guessing.Found out that Alex and Grig, who already destroyed over 40 enemy ships and realized that they had jammed their regular weapons, I thought they would be dead as remaining enemy fighters closed in on the good starfighter and fired about 28 close hits and about 15 direct hits at the starfigther ship. Alex wanted to use the death blossom, but Grigg warned him not to set off that until most of the ships are approximately 100 yards, which was the range of the weapons on death blossom. With that, Alex had to be patient for 10 more seconds before releasing that big weapon. His patience saved the lives of those in the fighter.And finally, Zur's command ship was almost like the ""death star"" in Star Wars, but about 200 times smaller. Alex and Grigg finds a way to destroy this ""big meat"" of the Kodan Armada by knocking out first the communications on that ship, and putting it out of action completely by knocking out its main gun turret. With that, the ship is sucked into the gravitational pull of a planet similar to our moon....and when the ship crashes into it, ending the evil reign of Zur....this represented the end of the Kodan Armada. And with that, Grigg, Alex...and the Frontier....are swept up in a victorious relief.",The Last Starfighter
57,TVholic,Yadda yadda yadda,8,29 December 2001,"Not a lot to say about this movie. It's pretty good for its time, but obviously one for the teens. The dialogue was rather lame, direction not great. Special effects were good. Lance Guest was wooden, Catherine Mary Stewart was her usual perky cutie-pie and Robert Preston was his patented con man. I wish Atari had come out with the Starfighter video game as stated in the end credits, but the failure of the movie doomed that.The one thing I can't say strongly enough is STAY AWAY FROM THE DVD! Universal seems to hate DVDs with a vengeance. I haven't seen a good one from them yet. The transfer on this DVD is horrible and murky. In the opening scene, Otis squints into the morning sun and says, ""Gonna be a sparklin' day!"" Thanks to the poor transfer, it looks more like heavy overcast. The nighttime scenes are nearly unwatchable. The speed limit sign left flapping by the Starcar blasting by is almost invisible. I thought maybe it was my DVD player or TV, but a friend with another Starfighter DVD says his looks just as bad on his setup. Quite a difference from the movie I saw in the theater in 1984 or even the bright and sharp Japanese letterboxed laserdisc.",The Last Starfighter
58,crash21,Very creative plot with dazzling special effects,8,24 February 2005,"This movie has to have one of the most creative plot lines I've ever seen. I think The Last Starfighter might actually be more entertaining than the original Star Wars movie. A kid beats a video game, which ends up being a test for his skills in fighting an intergalactic battle. And the CGI effects in this movie's space scenes put most current movies greatly to shame. So much of the CGI effects in today's movies all have rounded edges on everything, and look terribly fake. While the effects in The Last Starfighter are better than anything I've ever seen besides Jurassic Park, which really says something considering this was made in 1984. It's quite apparent that the effects in most of today's movies are done cheaply or using something that's very easy, considering they had effects this good done more than 30 years ago.",The Last Starfighter
59,NotMoreMovies,My favorite underrated sci-fi movie of all time!,9,16 July 2006,"In a time of cheap movie knockoffs, parodies, etc, it was refreshing to see a sci-fi movie with a truly original plot and an independent premise.The plot is as follows...Many billions of years ago, a league of planets gathered it's most talented pilots to fly their most advanced ships. They were known as the Starfighters.Then this league eventually built a HUGE shield system around all their planets that was completely invulnerable. This made the starfighters obsolete and they became talk of dreams and legends.Then one day, the league Commander's son (Xur) betrayed the secrets of the Frontier (the shield) to the Kodan Alliance, a ruthless band of conquerers.As a last resort, the Commander sent out recruiters to all the league's worlds to, once again, gather a Starfighter fleet.In an attempt to gain wealth and recognition, one of the recruiters (Centauri) sent a video game to earth that was an exact replica of the starfighter gunner controls, and if someone beat the game, it would send a signal directly to him. In his mind, anyone who could beat the game would have the coordination to be a starfighter gunner.Just days before the war, a young high school grad named Alex Rogan beat the game, and Centauri tricked him into coming along with him back to the command center. Once Alex realized he was in the middle of a war he freaked out and Centauri was forced to take him back to earth, because earth was not part of the league, so Alex was not obligated to fight.Then Alex learned that Xur was trying to assassinate him on earth, so he had a choice--run on earth or fight in space. So he chooses to return to the command center and help in the battle.He's teamed up with the best pilot in the fleet, a reptilian humanoid named Grig (played VERY well by the late Dan O'Herily).Then just before they launch Grig lets him in on some terrifying news... :) I hope I've gotten you interested, please rent this one, it's a true 80's classic! I doubt you'll regret seeing it! 9/10 for entertainment value and 3.5/4 stars",The Last Starfighter
60,shiftyeyeddog,Star Wars + Atari = blatant cash-in attempt,4,15 July 2008,"What do you get when you decide to use CG effects before they're good enough to use? You get The Last Starfighter. Every time they go to a computer-created shot of a ship or planet, it's quite jarring - takes you right out of the film. Technology just wasn't up to where it needed to be yet.The movie felt like a giant cash-in attempt, trying to suck in kids based on both their love of video games and their love of Star Wars. That Star Wars envy is most obvious in the score. While decent music, you can hear the SW inspiration in almost every piece, and a few cues almost sound like direct copies.24-year-old star Lance Guest LOOKS every bit of 24, though we're supposed to believe he and his friends are teenagers, getting ready to go off to college. But at least he's a passable actor, which is more than I can say for most of the supporting cast.I think if I saw this as a kid, i might have enjoyed it (as I was one of those kids into video games and Star Wars), but I had never seen it until now; and as an adult, it's just another silly, mediocre Star Wars knockoff.",The Last Starfighter

The story is fresh though and it is enjoyable to watch. The pre-CG effects and aliens were pretty good and the acting was decent. The only negatives I will point out is that the villain looks pretty lame and not intimidating at all with his poofy white hair and bald head, and Lance Guest's open-mouthed look of wonder (somewhat similar to Corey Haim's goofy gawk) gets really annoying. My favorite is the first hour, for me the star fight seemed anti-climactic. Going through all the fun to get up there was more entertaining. I give it a 6 out of 10.",The Last Starfighter
62,RyanEberhart,"A favorite from my childhood, classic!",10,16 July 2013,"Movie Review - The Last Starfighter: In 2009, Universal Studios released a 25th Anniversary Edition to one of my all time favorite movie, The Last Starfighter. Before the release of this edition I had been searching for several years for a DVD copy and when it finally was released I couldn't wait to buy it.The Last Star Fighter stars Lance Guest as Alex Rogan. Alex lives in a trailer park with his mother and brother and has big dreams of one day of moving away to the big city. All the inhabitants of the trailer park look to Alex as a sort of live-in handyman as he is constantly asked to fix several of his neighbor's maintenance issues. After yet another frustrating day in which he sees his girlfriend, Maggie, leave for a day at the lake and not being able to join her he begins to play an arcade style video game. While playing the video game Maggie comes back from the lake and they argue about her staying all day and being driven home by another guy, after they hash out the argument Alex breaks the high score in front of all the neighbors at the trailer park.When Alex's mom gets home he tells her about the video game. Unfortunately his mom has some bad news that was delivered to her instead of Alex. He runs off in frustration and ends up by the video game. A strange car arrives and the driver asks if Alex knows the person who broke the high score, to which he answers it was him. The driver, Centauri, asks Alex to get in the car and listen to an opportunity of a lifetime. Alex does and he is whisked away on an adventure.Centauri takes Alex to Rylos, another planet, to join the Star League. Alex refuses the opportunity and wants to return home. Centauri reluctantly agrees to bring Alex back to Earth. When Alex arrives home he forgets that a Beta unit had been left behind to take Alex's place. Alex calls for Centauri to come and collect the Beta Alex. Alex is attacked by an alien bounty hunter and Centauri arrives in time to save both Alex and Beta Alex; however, Centauri is wounded.Alex returns to Rylos with Centauri because he realizes that the enemies of Rylos will stop at nothing to kill him and to prevent that from happening and to protect his family he has to leave. When they arrive on Rylos Centauri dies of his wounds. Alex is again whisked away to begin his training, limited as it is. His navigator, Grigg, forces Alex into fighting the Ko-Dan Armada singlehandedly. Singlehandedly? This is because after Alex left to return to Earth the other Star Fighters were all killed in a surprise attack.Alex succeeds in defeating the Ko-Dan Armada and secures the safety of Rylos, at least for the time being. But he can't help thinking about Maggie, who by now knows that the Alex she has been with lately is a replacement. Maggie witnesses Beta Alex sacrificing himself to save Maggie and Alex. Maggie decides it is time to tell Alex's mother what has been going on as best she can, but before she does the wind kicks up and interrupts her.All of a sudden a spaceship arrives and it turns out to be Alex who is piloting it. Alex briefly explains to everyone what is going on and finally asks Maggie to come with him to Rylos where he has been asked to rebuild the Star League. Maggie at first refuses to go and leave her grandma, but decides she loves Alex too much to not go. This movie was made in the early 1980's and released in 1984, so the graphics aren't like what we would see today. The story line is hokey and stereotypical, why not when a spaceship lands in a trailer park, but it is a fun little movie. I love it as much now as I did watching it growing up.",The Last Starfighter

I remember that my younger me was wishing for something like this to happen to me. The same thing I wished from Star Wars and E.T.. It really fired up my imagination, such was the impact of this movie (and others like it).Now, nearly 37 years later, the story is still as fresh. Sure, the graphics now looks dated - even modern video games have better graphics - but the movie and it's story telling has held the test of time. A true 80s classic.Nowadays, most movie makers rely on CGI and big cinematic moments to wow the viewers, but with the script generally left wanting. Back in the 80s, movie makers really focused on the story telling. Coupled that with great scripts and capable directors, plus a dose of wonderful actors, produces quality classics. The 80s really produced some great movies that have stood the test of time like, E.T., Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Back to the Future, My Science Project etc.VERDICT?

66,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 29,7,8 November 1998,"29. THE LAST STARFIGHTER (SCI-fiction, 1984) For young Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) living in a trailer park is boring. He wants to escape from his rural existence and go to the city where he hopes to go to College. But for his girlfriend Annie (Catherine Mary Stewart) the prospect of leaving her grandmother behind is hard. Alex's only real excitement is playing a video game called 'Last Starfighter', having played it so many times that he finally breaks the game's points record. Soon after he's visited by a friendly alien power. They want to recruit him as one of their elite 'Starfighters' in an inter-galactic war where his skills will prove the turning point. Here he finds an unexpected chance to finally break free and follow his dreams. But will Annie join him?Critique: The 'Star Wars' phenomenon inspired a slew of science fiction films in its heyday that, surprisingly enough, has continued to this day. Although the 1980s produced its share of memorable films, this is one of the most appealing of the bunch. Capturing the youthful exuberance and innocence that made the 'Star Wars' fantasy a worldwide smash. The 'once upon story' line works from the disillusioned, dreamy nature of those kids whose earthly existence leave much to be desired. Wishing they could be whisked away to another galaxy, and take part in some far-off adventure. An added bonus to the film is the pairing of the 2 young leads. Exacting the warmth and amazement of encountering such a journey, and taking their love to the infinite reaches of space. This is a true and forgotten gem of what was an otherwise a forgetful decade for sci-fi films.",The Last Starfighter
67,larry.launders,More obscure than it should be.,9,29 July 2005,"While it may be easy to lump this movie in with Star Wars, I think that is unfair to ""The Last Starfighter."" About the only thing the two share in common is that the plot and setting involve space, our hero is a pilot, and both broke new ground in movies in some fashion.As I recall this did not exactly make smashing headlines so far as box office receipts are concerned, which is a shame. I remember seeing it in the theater and thought it was highly entertaining.However, I think it is fair to say that what westerns brought to previous generations as good, character-based story lines, both Star Wars and The Last Starfighter borrow from the same sources.The special effects you can read about in the trivia. On the DVD there is an interview with the people responsible for them, and to hear them talk about what they went through to get the (now) seemingly simple computer effects versus what todays machines can do is absolutely astounding.*** POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS AHEAD *** Here we have our hero who has a goal in life, something beyond ""going to city college like everyone else"" and a long happy and successful life with his then girlfriend, which he is not afraid to pursue. But when faced with an even bigger calling, is reluctant simply because of its enormity and, given the context, insanity.The biggest failing I find with it has all to do with how the Kodan (the bad guys) are handled. They're very generic, and shallow. We know nothing about them other than they ARE the enemy and apparently have been for some time. We get vague references and see cruel examples, which are not of the bad guys but rather of the turncoat Xur.You do get the impression room was left for a sequel. The enormity of what lies ahead for our hero does come across a bit...hammy, but it works. Robert Preston ads a LOT of character to the struggle.Still overall, a very enjoyable movie. 'Family friendly' except a couple of isolated moments with Louis, Alex's younger brother.",The Last Starfighter

This movie really touches the mind and heart of all who see it. The late Robert Preston gave a super performance as the alien Centauri. He says some things to Alex that is true about what you think of yourself. Peter Nelson (Brian of V and V The Final Battle) is an awesome cast member too, he plays Jack Blake, Alex's friend. Vernon Washington (Friday The 13th Part V) as Otis is awesome too, Britt Leach(Silent Night, Deadly Night and Weird Science) , Dan O'Herlihy (Halloween III,Robocop 1 and 2) as Grig really makes the movie great too.

69,bdl7431,Really - It's a lot of fun!,8,28 July 2011,"I just watched this on cable - and really, it has held up rather well over time! Sure, the effects are dated - remember, this was an early version of computer graphics, and was done on a Cray XM/P supercomputer, so it looks rather quaint by today's standards. But really, the film doesn't take itself too seriously - there are wonderful bits of humor that float up that keeps things entertaining.SPOILER ALERT! The film revolves around a young man - Alex - who is stuck in a backwater trailer park with his mom, brother and an assortment of folks. Alex has dreams though, but when he tries to realize his dreams, he keeps getting stuck. His main escape is playing a video game called ""The Last Starfighter"", which is located at the trailer park. Alex excels at gameplay.The thing is, the game is actually a test to find creatures who are capable of being Starfighters. The film takes off from there.Really, what makes the Last Starfighter exceptional is the writing and acting! The premise of the film is that you have a person who suddenly finds himself in the middle of an alien culture - and I do mean ALIEN - and rather than completely freaking out, which I am sure most of us would do - he manages to go along with it using a sense of humor. And the audience can suspend belief and go along for the ride. Look at the memorable quotes section - there are others that were missed - for example, when the robot unit that has substituted for Alex is making out with Maggie, he is an absolute klutz at it - Maggie is disgusted, and the robot's tell her - ""I am not familiar with these glandular games"".So, watch this - it is better than a lot of modern movies and its low score.",The Last Starfighter

Great fun.,7,9 October 2016,"My kids watched this movie over and over on VHS and I will admit I watched it with them pretty often - and even occasionally on my own.There's nothing special about the plot, characters or special effects, but there was a dream-come-true quality that worked better than usual. I even felt it myself as an adult male. Imagine flying off into space with a beautiful girl after having unexpectedly discovered you had hidden talents that suddenly made you an indispensable hero to the universe. What guy ever loses that dream? Robert Preston and Dan O'Herlihy were superb of course, and that undoubtedly added to the impact.Modern CGI might make the film look out-of-date to most kids today, but it might be worth giving it a shot.

I must have seen it about a thousand times, and I know all the dialogue by heart (even the parts I didn't understand when i was a kid). This movie is about an unlikely hero, who is picked to fight an intergalactic battle, and how was he found? Well this guy made a video game simulation of the battle that was taking place in outer space, and sent it across the universe. Of course this kid just happened to have the skills needed to defeat the video game, and kill the virtual bad guys. When a guy in a flying car (this is literally where Back to the Future Prt II got it from) he is told that the game is not only a video simulation, but also a test, and now he must leave his family and join the Star League and become a 'Starfighter'.I enjoyed this movie immensely when I was a kid. For me it holds the same cult status as 'The Blues Brothers', and now when I watch it, it seems as good today as it did 15 years ago.When compared to today's high-quality graphics and effects, this movie may seem a little lame, and it is, but when I consider that this movie was one of the first to use complete computer graphical effects, it makes me think ""Wow, that was a great movie"".So if you see it now, you may not think it's as great as I have made it out to be...  but your kids are gonna love it.",The Last Starfighter

It also had a theme of not letting great opportunities pass you by, of being more than everyone expects of you. And the movie was just plain FUN! I dismiss people who always spout ""It's just a Star Wars rip-off"", as if Star Wars is the only 80's Sci-Fi movie worthy of any consideration. I think Star Wars paved the way for movies like TLS to be made, at least that is my assertion. The Last Starfighter is a great family movie as well as a neat experience.

77,moviefan1725-1,A vastly underrated gem that stands the test of time,10,9 September 2006,"Today's audiences will rarely see a movie that doesn't contain some sort of CGI effects. But back 1984 they were just taking the first steps into this age of effects. Both The Last Starfighter and Tron took the leap, and both made the most of it. While the effects of Starfighter are certainly dated, the movie isn't. Simply because it doesn't make the mistake that so many effects-heavy movies do...it never loses sight of character. The characters and the story are the most important elements here, and that's what makes timeless. Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) is a young man that, like Luke Skywalker, dreams of his life becoming more than what it seems he is destined for. In Star Wars, you can feel the dreams that Luke has as he looks out over the Tatooine desert at the twin sunset. There is a similar moment in Starfighter when Alex sits in his room, and stares at the mobile of the solar system on his bedroom ceiling being blown about by the wind coming through the window. When he breaks the record on the Starfighter game, he is recruited by a mysterious visitor named Centauri (Robert Preston), who is in fact an alien that reveals to him that the Starfighter game is a test sent out across the universe to find the few with the ""gift"" to become true Starfighters. Whisked away to the planet Rylos, Alex finds that he is needed to defend the universe against the villains he defeated in the game. Back on earth, Alex is replaced by a ""simuloid"" called Beta who looks like Alex, but has no idea on how to be him. Especially when it comes to matters of the heart with Alex's girlfriend Maggie (the stunning Catherine Mary Stewart). But heart is what this movie has in abundance. It's light hearted, exciting, funny, and moving. It's literally the kind of movie you don't see anymore, and that's a shame. In today's age, the characters in movies similar to this, are as phony as the CGI worlds they inhabit. But Starfighter never lets us forget that no matter how spectacular a visual effect is, it's an empty thing without people to care about. Another element that cannot be ignored is the musical score by Craig Safan. It's one of the best of the 80's. Similar to John Williams' Star Wars and Superman themes, it change in tempo can make it exciting or romantic. I really wish I could find it on CD. I saw this movie for the first time in 1984, and today I shared it for the first time with my two kids, ages 9 and 7. They LOVED it. My son wanted to know if there was a REAL video game for it, or if there were action figures for it. It was really special to share this movie with them. It proves it's multi-generational, and worthy of a place in movie history, for more reasons than just it's ground breaking visual effects. A classic.",The Last Starfighter

What I mean to say is... if a popular show references this movie along with every other awesome ""classic"" sci fi flick from BTTF to T2, then you should know the audience that ""The last Starfighter"" is for. Yes... basically early millennials and the generation before. But then why is ""retro"" even a word? Ralph defines retro as ""old, but cool"".

My daughters (10 and 12) loved it, though they noted that the special effects were a bit obvious (see also reason (2)).

It was the first full-length motion picture to rely entirely on computer-generated graphics for its special effects, arguably blazing the way for the CGI industry of a decade later.  From the perspective of 18 years later, these effects are pretty obvious, but they are not primitive. They work well.  And they were done on computers that were less powerful than the laptop I'm typing this review on.The second bit of film history in this movie is that it was one of the last films to co-star Robert Preston, in a role that is deliberately modeled on one his most famous (and enjoyable roles), that of the outrageous flim-flam man of The Music Man.  ""Centuri"" (Preston) is the reincarnation of Professor Harold Hill in outer space.  If you are a fan of Robert Preston, you'll enjoy his performance in this movie.

It was a nice family treat.(2) You want to see a bit of film history; this one has two attractions. It was the first full-length motion picture to rely entirely on computer-generated graphics for its special effects, arguably blazing the way for the CGI industry of a decade later. From the perspective of 18 years later, these effects are pretty obvious, but they are not primitive. They work well. And they were done on computers that were less powerful than the laptop I'm typing this review on.The second bit of film history in this movie is that it was one of the last films to co-star Robert Preston, in a role that is deliberately modeled on one his most famous (and enjoyable roles), that of the outrageous flim-flam man of The Music Man. ""Centuri"" (Preston) is the reincarnation of Professor Harold Hill in outer space. If you are a fan of Robert Preston, you'll enjoy his performance in this movie. It is obvious that he enjoyed doing it.",The Last Starfighter

It's called ""Star Wars"" . . . remember?The people who created this ""The Last Starfighter"" stole a generous portion of it from George Lucas, e.g., a young man destined for greatness; a female who has to be saved; a planet blowing up; crazy alien costumes; a weird-looking co-pilot; a mature, wise man; fighting an overwhelming opponent against all odds; even the final scenes are a ripoff.

It's not as great as Star Wars or some of the big budget movies of the time... (hmmm, where there any big budget Sci Fi movies other than Star Wars at the time?)  The acting, though not great was charming.  Lance Guest (brillantly playing Alex and the very naive Beta), Greg O'Herlihy (sp) playing the loveable Lizard creature Grig and of course.... Robert Preston as rascalous Centauri.  And something that I forgot for a long time (until I saw it at a local store and had to buy it on DVD) was that this was one, if not THE, first movie to utilize CGI.  Yeah, it's a far cry from what filmakers can do now with Apple Rendering software.  But when I saw the movie in the Theater, I was impressed and thought that if Computer Graphics were this good in the this first movie... how much it will grow.

But we are talking about TLS here, so here we go.The Last Starfighter is a space adventure PERFECT for kids around 10-11. The special effects, the tongue-in-cheek script, the whole movie is one of the most exciting and entertaining films to come out of the early 1980s. The use of CGI space ships-then state of the art-may look dated today, but keep in mind this was 1984, so I feel that it doesn't hurt the film that much.*Spoilers ahead* The story is about Alex Rogen, a high school kid living in a trailer park with a talent for an arcade game called 'Star Fighter'. One faithful night, he beats the top score, and the next day, a man named Centauri comes to recruit him to fight evil, the game acting as the proverbial sword in the stone which leads Alex to his destiny, leaving behind a robot double to fill in as his replacement. The film does a good job of making a star wars like fantasy that is just different enough to keep it fresh. Lots of fun, with an enthralling soundtrack and good acting all around, especially from the late Robert Preston(Centauri), who plays the role of Centauri. It is also interesting to note that the film was originally going to spawn a tie-in video game of the same name, Atari's first 3D polygonal arcade game to use a Motorola 68000 as the CPU, but it was never released.

After all this time I'm glad to say it still has it's charm. Sure it does seem a little rushed, the performances aren't the best, and... well the action does seem pretty dull even by the 80's standards. Not to mention the fact that the CG spaceships look way too artificial (it would've looked much better had they just used regular models on a blue screen) Main point being don't buy this expecting Star Wars quality visuals. Still the film's got something, and it really is a great story overall. I wouldn't mind a special edition of this released maybe with a touch up on the CG sequences and maybe the director could dig around in the archives and restore some scenes, but that's a long shot. So I say just enjoy it for what it is, a great 80's sci-fi coming of age story, noting classic, but not too shabby either.",The Last Starfighter

Granted, the visuals seem a little dated today, but the film has heart, and that is where it triumphs.  It's basic tale of good vs. evil is timeless, it's characters are lively and believable, and the film's true charm lies in its ability to engage your emotions and make you cheer simply by making you care about the characters.

I've been watching it since I was a young boy (I'm not that old now) and don't miss a chance to see it ever when it's on TV or when I come across it in a video store.

101,gladrius,Good way to kill an hour and a half,7,22 September 2004,"Might be some spoilers ahead, so read at your own risk. This movie had a setup I could totally get behind. There's this rural bumpkin, Alex Rogan, who wants to do big things with his life. Who doesn't? But with his college loan denied and his girlfriend afraid of leaving her roots, his only solace is a video game called Starfighter. He finds out that it's actually a recruiting tool for an alien space fleet, though, and is soon whisked off to save the universe from some alien invaders. Who wouldn't like to hear that all those hours in front of the Nintendo might lead to becoming the hero of the universe?At its heart, The Last Starfighter is really little besides a mishmash of most of the major sci-fi of the 70's and early 80's, with yet more of the tried and true, ""I'm not cut out to be a real hero,"" ""only you can do what must be done"" stuff thrown together. But that's not to say it's bad. If you look at everything in minute detail it'll fall apart like a house of cards, but unless I'm watching a movie that's been on MST, I tend not to do that.The Last Starfighter is a fine movie if you're willing to just go with it and enjoy what it gives you. And it never gives you much or indeed any reason to regret doing so. Yeah, the aliens are as typical a bunch of invaders as you'll ever see. Yeah, Alex's spaceship looks like its trying hard to be an X-Wing but not an obvious rip-off of one. Yeah he has to spend the first half of the movie whining before he gets his act together, yeah there's an annoying little brother. But The Last Starfighter makes it easy to just go with the flow despite it all.I give it a good eight of ten. Don't try to analyze it, just go with it, and you'll have a great time.

102,Daryle,It's Space Opera; but it's fun Space Opera!,7,23 October 2008,"I just watched this again for the first time in probably a two decades. Sure the CGI has been eclipsed but it definitely pushed the envelope at the time and should be considered an excellent evolutionary example. Heck I remember when Cray was synonymous with supercomputing and it was so cool to have a film rendered on one. The cast was definitely above average for an 80's flick and they, along with the movie in general, has aged rather well. The soundtrack is also rousing and satisfying for the genre. One thing I noticed this time is that I'll bet Luc Besson saw this movie and copied the ""frontier"" in 'The Fifth Element'. Oh, and I also caught the 'Dr. Strangelove' line before even looking at the trivia (although I was surprised that it was an actual audio clip from Slim Pickens scene).

This is my first post though, so I *may* have been a little too forward.  So... you've been warned.  :)I love this movie; it's one of my favorite sci-fi movies of all time, as a matter of fact.  It's about a teenage boy named Alex Rogan, a trailer-park kid who spends many days and nights trying to master a video-game called Starfighter.  When he finally does, an alien named Centauri appears in a Star Car and takes him to a starbase, where he learns to become a *real-life* Starfighter, trying to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Co-Dan Armada.  Soon, the starbase and all but one Gunstar battleship are destroyed, and it's up to Alex, along with Star Navigator Grig, to save the day.This is a very touching story, as Alex has to put his nervous feelings aside to help defeat the Co-Dan Armada and bring peace to the galaxy.

And I tell you, this movie wasn't a big deal then; it was considered a well made but derivative B movie, and the CGI effects were almost never mentioned in reviews or articles. I have checked it now in newspaper archives online, so I know I remember it right.The ironic thing is that ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" (1985) was released this same year; I saw it soon after ""The Last Starfighter"". The Sherlock Holmes movie was hailed for its alleged groundbreaking CGI effect: a very short sequence where a knight of stained glass attack a priest. This effect lasted perhaps 20 seconds...""The Last Starfighter"" is full of CGI sequences, and either me or my friends in the theater recognized them as computer images, and absolutely not as ""cheap video game graphics"" as some reviewers here describe it. And no journalist or reviewer saw it that way either, back then. But when I watch this movie on DVD today, many sequences really look distinctly artificial with unnatural sharp edges and light, much like computer graphics, which give them a style that cut them out from the rest of the movie. My theory is that the celluloid copies that we were watching in the theaters smothered this down and gave these sequences a much more natural look; and that the movie makers originally counted on this when they incorporated the CGI scenes with the rest of the movie.The movie is well made, with a rather original story and good performances by the actors.

The story is about this nobody, Alex, who plays a video game outside the convenient store and, because he's so good at it, is summoned by an alien to go save the universe. Now, you might think it's bad, but you might be wrong...In fact, this is more a comedy than a sci-fi movie. The strength of this film relies on the ability it has to just make fun of itself and of other films of the genre. For example, the alien who takes Alex in the skies doesn't do it for the sake of the universe, but almost only for money! And when Alex discovers he's in the middle of a war, he decides to go back home! so much for a hero... And adding to that very superficial characters and screenplay, a lackluster soundtrack and the cheesiest special effects around, you might think you're in for a bad trip... but again, you might be wrong.Of course, if you take this movie seriously, you will probably get bored to death, but if you see it as a comedy, as a film made by people who definitely saw too big for the money they had, you might just be in for some good honest laughs.

Bob Preston in an sf film? Cool!I had no idea it would be one of his last.The Last Starfighter is going to be regarded as a classic by future generations for a lot of reasons. It was the first sf film to use extensive CGI, and use them exclusively for the space scenes, it was one of Robert Preston's last two films, and was one of the only film appearances of the great Meg Wylie, a Star Trek veteran, who takes an almost nonexistent role and makes it memorable here.I doubt there's anybody who hasn't seen this, but...S P O I L E R   W A R N I N G ! ! ! ! !One of the best things about TLS is its simple insistence on a single message: if you believe in yourself, you can change the world. You can be more than you are. And as bad as things look, they do get better. Your chance for greatness will come. And when it does, you'd better grab it with both hands and hold tight.Early in the film, after Alex is forced to pass up a day at the lake with Maggie, he laments to Otis that all he does is patch old fuse panels and fix rickety plumbing. And Otis tells him his chance will come. When it does come, in the form of Centauri and the Rylan Star League, Alex backs off because he's afraid of the danger involved. After all, he's just a kid from a trailer park...""If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be"", barks Centauri. And Alex is left to chew on that.The entire point of the film is right there. It doesn't matter if you're rich as Croesus or a kid from a trailer park in the middle of tumbleweeds and tarantulas. If you believe in yourself, and you're willing to take a chance to better yourself, you can accomplish anything.Get this movie on DVD. Grab your wife and kids.

It came out when Star Wars did, so it did not receive the attention it deserved.I like the movie for its storyline, acting, direction, and effects, which at the time were novel.It appealed to me because it had all the elements of fantasies many of us have, good battling evil, being the hero, romance, dealing with adversity, second chances, space travel, adventure, dead end situation eliminated by new opportunities, lots of ""what would I do in his situation"" moments.I thought the actors did a great job. Not using big named stars helped make the story more believable and also let me focus on the story, not the actors. By using Lance Guest, for example, I easily accepted that this was an average guy in any-town USA. A big star would have told me right at the beginning ""Oh, this is the hero, lets see how he slays the dragons."" I also thought the direction was great. For example, the opening scene of the trailer park, focusing on the little things that tell you this is as simple a place as can be.Some of my favorite movies include The Godfather series, anything by Kurosawa, Citizen Kane, etc. So it is not like I am rating Last Starfighter with an empty head :)",The Last Starfighter

118,chuck-julian,barely watchable,3,24 July 2012,"The film had decent acting by the main characters but the dialog was pretty lame. As an example, Grig should not refer to his wife as his ""wife-oid"". The writer clearly wanted to infer that his wife was not human but human or not, the ""oid"" at the end shows the level of amateurish writing. The plot was interesting and could have been made into a much better movie. The film suffered from really poor special effects. It sought to appeal to the computer gaming crowd by making the battle screens appear as though you switched from watching a Hollywood movie to watching an Atari game counsel. That didn't work for me, especially after having seen Star Wars.",The Last Starfighter
119,neslo_roy,Extened cut...please?,9,9 August 2020,"I've loved this film from the first time I saw it back in 1984, when it was first released.
Since the first writings of Jules Verne, it's been many people's dream to be tapped to save the universe.
Highly recommend this movie as pure fun and entertainment.
I've seen this many times over the years, and have noted that the actors talk frequently about parts of the film that we do not see. ie Mags tongue being stuck in beta units ear, that resulted in the real Alex getting his face slapped by Mags, or the beta unit making multiple mistakes around the trailer park. Such as messing up Mrs. Boone's stove. It really leaves me wondering just how much of the film ended up on the cutting room floor. It would be interesting to see another cut of this movie. One in which fitting into 100 min run time was not the priority.
After all Robert Preston and Dan O'Herlihy were both so good in this, and of course it was Preston' last film. Love to see more of them. Forget the sequal... just an extened cut.",The Last Starfighter

123,thenar,"It's a historic film with a great story,",9,7 April 2005,"LSF was the first film to use extensive CG. The story was a lot of fun too and the picture was well made. I still enjoy watching it after all these years. BTW Digital Productions (DP), the company doing the CG work, had to employ a double headed DEC VAX 782 computer to feed their massive Cray X-MP supercomputer. The Cray could not be used directly because of connectivity and software issues. DP was also running a separate farm of Evans and Southerland PS300s for the digitizing/modeling and IMI 500s in front of the VAX 782s, to set up the motion sequences. It took more than six months to render the film's 36,000 animation frames! And their lease on the Cray alone was over $250,000 per month! The situation did not foreshadow the coming digital invasion of Hollywood. On top of all that, the render quality of what we generate in real-time today can actually be better than what they were able to achieve with all that heavy equipment and time. this was only a little over 20years ago.

124,sanctuary-1,Simply Outstanding,10,8 January 2002,"This is my number 2 all time film behind Star Wars.  It did not have a big budget or big name stars (except for Robert Preston) but what a wonderful story and so magnificently played by the actors.  And the ending is truly magical.  Every time I see the end, it brings tears to my eyes.  The Last Starfighter is a sci-fi adventure, a pure love story and a testament for anyone who ever dreamed of doing the impossible.  There are two magnificent quotes in the film.  The first is Otis when he tells Alex that when you find your dream you have to ""Grab On and Hold Tight"".  The second is when Maggie looks to the sky and tells Alex ""I Love You Alex Rogan""  as if she knows he will hear her even though she knows he is many million miles away.If you ever wanted to watch a movie with no pretensions, pure fun, and a wonderful story, this is it.

Bear in mind that most ""film buffs"" would not recognize any of these things if they were sitting on their lap and licking their face.For me, it comes down to this. This movie has neat special effects, especially for a movie made in '84, a couple of great performances from Robert Preston and Dan O'Herlihy, and a computer-generated starship that breakdances while blowing the crap out of everything in a five-mile radius.7 out of 10, baby.7 out of 10.",The Last Starfighter

I feel sorry for those of you who cannot look past the special effects.  They were great then, and they still are good now.  The storyline is what matters in a film, and here is a film with some depth (unlike many of today).To avoid the risk of spoilers, let me say that I believe it shows us that we are all scared of leaving what's familiar-- but that's a part of growing up and being able to see more than just what's over your nose.

I have watched this movie countless times over the years, and it is still a classic to me.  The effects are a little outdated now, but at the time in which the movie came out, they were rather interesting.  They looked like they were computer animated, and for a mid '80s movie they were pretty good.  I was hoping for more of an explanation as to why the war with the ""Codan Armada"" was taking place, but overall, it was still a good flick.",The Last Starfighter
128,tabaqui-1,A complete awkward non-charming disaster train wreck of a movie,2,31 July 2016,"This movie is so bad it's just bad. Really bad. Nothing even remotely makes sense, including space, government, military, engineering, interior design and espionage, the sets and aliens looks cheap and unimaginative and gray. The alien recruiter just fly straight to the super secret star base, yet the fresh prince of douche is valuable to the invaders because he has this knowledge. His recruit is never checked for quality and only filtered out when he says he never wanted to be there in the first place, yet Centauri has already been given his money. The dialogue is awkward ""tell don't show"" exposition most of the time without any effort to make it even remotely enjoyable, the acting is often awful, and the sequel baiting is cringeworthily woven into the main movie leading to 3 main bad guys who don't even do stuff enough for one. The bad guys are pretty much useless and do next to nothing, the heroic self sacrifice of the comic relief is ultimately completely useless, and the love interest pretty much declares to empty air with glittering eyes how much she loves the main character over the burning dead body of the poor shmuck.90 minute movie with end credits, and the main guy only stops caring about saving his own bacon at the 72nd minute and gladly puts everyone he knows and presumably loves in the crossfire to cover his tracks from alien assassins.They retcon the death of Centauri at the end, but never bothered to reshoot any scenes relating to his original death, so that feels super cheap too.",The Last Starfighter

I mean, 1984, around the time that Star Wars Return of the Jedi came out, i was expecting a cheesy rip-off film. What i got was something completely different. Basically, a young teenager in a boring trailer park in the middle of nowhere finds an arcade-style video game and decides to play it, he gets the high score of ALL TIME and everybody goes nuts! (what do you do in the middle of nowhere?) and the result is an unforgettable adventure that will have you laughing again, and again. the Special effects are incredible and the CGI is jaw dropping for the time.

It's also a bit of wish fulfillment for those of us that grew up pumping quarters into arcade video games.In my opinion the acting is above average for a movie like this. It is much helped by veteran actors Robert Preston and Dan O'Herlihy. Lance Guest does a great turn as Alex as well.The effects were not appreciated at the time, I think, but hold up fairly well. They were drawn on that Holy Grail of computers to us children of the 80's; a Kray Supercomputer.The score is well done, the humor timed well and the overall good feeling I get from watching it never fades.

132,sanctuary22,Simple the best,10,29 September 2015,"I would give this movie an 11 if I could. Even now after 30 years, I still laugh at the early scenes' subtle jokes and intricate character interplay while crying multiple times as love and commitment continually overcome fear and hesitancy in the final half hour. While both Star Wars and this movie portray a ""small town"" boy thrust into the intergalactic spotlight, Star Wars plays out on the grand stage while Starfighter is more the intimate portrait. Not to mention, Starfighter went where no movie had gone before in basically inventing from scratch the CGI technology that we now take for granted. How much longer would it have taken if the producers had not taken the leap of faith that this movie could be built on a computer screen versus the tried and true modeler's table. And then there is Craig Safan's score that rivals and in many cases surpasses John Williams' Star Wars themes. I still often listen to the soundtrack, turning the volume way up as the heart wrenching notes that carry the final scene give way to a crescendo of joy as the credits roll. In the end, there is one small scene that will forever lock The Last Starfighter as my favorite right beside Star Wars. The scene occurs just after the Beta unit sacrifices himself to save Alex. That is when Maggie turns to the sky and speaks to Alex across the gulf of space, knowing he will hear even though light years separate them. Five simple words that characterize the theme of the entire movie. You can hear those words and understand their meaning by watching yourself. And then learn what a truly special movie The Last Starfighter is.",The Last Starfighter

I think he loves it just as much as I did back in the 80's. Those web sites that suggest that it is a knockoff from Starwars could not be further from the truth. It has it's own original flair and I had always secretly hoped for a sequel. My only regret is that the producers/director could have made the accomplishments of the main hero in far off space more in depth and varied before his return home. The actor who portrays Grig does an outstanding job as a supporting character. The character development overall is excellent, and they left much more room to expand on in the future had they desired. I understand that Atari was actually supposed to make the ""Last Starfighter"" arcade game and I am not sure it they ever did. If so I would be interested to see or even own it.

We haven't got there yet, where they're available to anyone, but I still dream.This story appeals to me on a human level, where it is supposed that as societies get more technological, they lose their humanity and become more materialistic and commit crimes against humanity, this story forwards the idea that people (or aliens as it may be) can at least retain their humanity.I have the Starfighter movie theme, in a MIDI sound file.

An arcade game as a test to see who is most qualified to defend the galaxy against forces of evil... of all kinds. The aliens were pretty cool, and Centauri's car was pretty damn sweet! *smirk* The fight scenes were pretty good and the acting wasn't bad. Hmmm... let's see... only thing I thought was stupid was the 2 pinhead aliens constantly looking in what looked like a stripped-out air hockey table, watching....not taking their eyes off of it as everyone else is dying around them...

Something that would go on to become a standard term in science fiction films. CGI - Computer Generated Imagery. All the spaceships, planets, stars and meteors are all computer generated.No-one had ever done anything like this before. All the images were generated by the Cray 2 super computer. The only other people using this computer at the time were NASA. The main thing that let the fantastic computer visuals down were the very bad practical explosions.Centauri's car (a poorly disguised De Lorean) which seems to be much bigger inside than outside, stealing an idea from Doctor Who. Admittedly this film does borrow heavily from things like Star Wars, but all films were borrowing from Star Wars back then.I do like the scenes with the Beta Unit, learning how to become Alex.The plot as such is thin on the ground, but all in all the film is something you watch just to kick back and kill some time.Enjoy this and realize without this movie things like Toy Story, Shark Tale, A bugs life would never exist.A piece of movie history to watch and enjoy.Overdue a remake or sequel.woot,Mr. Hebert pwns!

I sincerely believe this movie is the reason I ended up with a B.S. in Graphic Design, specializing in computer graphics.I might point out that Tron DID hit the theaters two years before this movie and incorporated CG work. So this wasn't the FIRST movie to do it. It was, however, the first movie to make such massive use of CG.
