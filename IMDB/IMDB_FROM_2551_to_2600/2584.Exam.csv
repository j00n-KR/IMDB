0,Leofwine_draca,Not one you'd want to sit through,2,25 July 2011,"Drawing on all manner of films that have come before – I'm thinking of the likes of 12 ANGRY MEN as well as more recent fare such as CUBE – EXAM wants nothing more than to be a taught little thriller with an intriguing premise: eight candidates in a room, taking an exam that consists of a blank sheet of paper. The movie takes place in real time, inside a single room, with the utter exclusion of special effects, focusing solely on the character interactions that take place. With such a premise, you know that the plotting and the scripting better be darn good, and unfortunately in EXAM's case, it just isn't.The main problem for me is that the stakes just aren't high enough. It's like watching the first episode in a new series of THE APPRENTICE – you don't know or particularly like any of the characters, so whether they win the job or not just doesn't matter. At least films like BATTLE ROYALE upped the ante by killing off the candidates who lose but there's no sense of that drama here, just a bunch of bickering characters you couldn't care less about. And it doesn't help when the entire cast are all so unlikeable, sharing such characteristics as smugness, arrogance and a sense of their own superiority. Chukwudi Iwuji is the only one I had the slightest interest in and that's thanks to the strength of his performance.Admittedly, it's not all bad, with things picking up around halfway through for some pretty intense drama during the ""paper cut"" sequence. Sadly, it slides back into boredom after this, and finishes up with a lengthy and pretentious explanation which turns the whole film into one big joke. Add in some entirely cheap sci-fi staples (including some nonsense about a ""virus"") and you have a film which could have offered a lot but which ends up as virtually nothing.",Exam
1,SnoopyStyle,thrilling mystery but solution is a letdown,6,7 October 2015,"Eight people with various skills are brought to a room to vie for a job in a powerful corporation. The Invigilator lays out the task for the group to be completed within 80 minutes. Each person sits at a desk with a piece of paper with the word Candidate and a number. The group struggles to cooperate to find out what the question even is. As each attempt fails, the group turns on each other.This is a high concept mystery thriller written by Stuart Hazeldine and Simon Garrity, and directed by Hazeldine. It's a compelling watch and a real puzzler. It's a real tight thriller inside one room. In the end, the resolution is a little bit disappointing and a letdown. With a great puzzle, the solution can elevate the whole movie with its inventiveness. This solution is more of a cheat.",Exam
2,Prismark10,The test of souls,5,26 March 2015,Exam is a kind of self contained film which reminded me of the cult movie Cube.Eight candidates enter a room for an employment assessment exam for a pharmaceutical company responsible for a miracle drug widely used after a viral pandemic. The candidates sit down at their individual desks containing the exam paper. The invigilator informs the candidates of the rules and failure to follow the rules will lead to ejection.It turns out that the question papers are blank. One candidate is almost immediately removed from the room for spoiling her paper by writing on it. The seven remaining candidates talk to each other and work together to figure what the one question is and the appropriate answer without breaking the rules. However as they cooperate they develop personality types leading to conflict and worse.The film starts of intriguingly enough as slowly the candidates character traits are are uncovered and we learn something about each candidate and it turns out some of them are more devious. I can applaud this bottle film as an intense psychological examination but it fails to sustain its intriguing premise and the ending felt rather disappointing as the film became ever more hysterical.,Exam
3,claudio_carvalho,"Suspenseful Use of the Storyline of ""El método"" (2005) Combined with the Violence and Tension of ""Das Experiment"" (2001)",7,11 April 2014,"In a near future, eight candidates are in the final stage for the position of CEO's assistant in a pharmaceutical corporation. They are locked in a room and the invigilator tells them that they have eighty minutes to answer one question only. He explains that in the lawless space there are only three rules to be followed otherwise they would be disqualified: they should talk neither to him nor to the armed guard; they should not spoil their piece of paper; and they should not leave the room. He starts the chronometer and leaves the room. Then the candidates discover that they have a blank piece of paper with their numbers only. One woman starts writing on the paper and is removed from the room for spoiling the paper. The other candidates figure out that they are allowed to talk to each other and they need teamwork to discover the questions. As far as the time runs out, the tension increases. ""Exam"" is a low-budget movie with an intriguing psychological thriller and great direction and performances. The suspenseful story uses of the storyline of ""El método"" (2005) combined with the violence and tension of ""Das Experiment"" (2001). However it fails for not providing the big picture of this society with infected people and why the group wishes so bad the position in the corporation.

4,kosmasp,Passing the test,7,25 December 2013,"Of course it's not your regular test, but I'm sure you'd kind of expected that. Would be a strange movie, if it was just people writing an exam for 90 minutes and then maybe we're even seeing the teacher going through them and correcting them. Different movie then, because this is a thriller and this is not your typical exam.Of course you also get different kind of people/characters. Everyone has their own agenda, though we're not sure of the agenda of the firm that is hiring. We'll find out soon enough though. But until then, we have endure with the people taking the exam and the tasks they are given. All plays obviously in one location and it suits the story.

6,blanche-2,"psychological study of competition, stress, anger, and ambition",8,3 October 2015,"""Exam"" is a wonderful psychological study of eight people who are the top candidates for an important job with a high-level corporation. The time period is some time in the future. Eight candidates are put in a windowless room, and an Invigilator (Colin Salmon). They have 80 minutes to answer a question. There are four rules: don't talk to him, don't talk to the guard, don't leave the room, and don't spoil the piece of paper in front of them.The candidates find the sheet in from of each of them blank. One tries to write on the paper and is ejected immediately. After a time, one person figures out that they can talk to one another, and they attempt by various means to see what's on the paper. Lights, liquids, nothing works. Slowly as the clock goes down, the real personalities of the candidates begin to emerge, and we learn more about them. One of the features aggravating the situation is that there is a plague, something like AIDS, that is killing people, and this company has come up with medications that can help and are working toward a cure. One of the women has a partner who cannot afford the medication, which is why she is applying for the job. One of the candidates has the disease.The stress becomes worse and worse as people not only seek to find out the question, but ""White"" (Luke Mably) tries to manipulate people to break a rule so they can be eliminated.This is an excellent film, though one has to take into account that it is happening in the future. At least in the present, no one would go through what these people did for a job, especially with a selection process like that. I would have left after the Invigilator talked. So we don't know what's going on in the world.The film presents a real puzzle, and getting to the solution is a fascinating process for the viewer.The acting is very good and intense, with Luke Mably having the showiest role. Colin Salmon, the Invigilator, has one of the best voices in the world and has an incredible presence.Really enjoyed this.",Exam
7,Theo Robertson,Very Average Marks,5,4 March 2014,"Eight people at a corporate company are invited to take a test . There will be only one successful candidate . The examiner lays down some ground rules and exits leaving an armed guard in the room who the candidates are not allowed to talk to . They now have 80 minutes to complete the exam . They turn over their papers only to find the pages are blank and there is no question This is one of these movies that demolishes the opposition during a film pitch . It's a great idea because we've all been there . We've all gone to job interviews and been asked to do radical psychometric tests which have absolutely no bearing in the job we're applying for and are so stupid and frivolous that only a genius could have thought them up so in theory this movie should have a very wide audience In practise however things don't work out that way . The mechanics of the plot are constantly undermined by a character putting two and two together in order to drive the plot forward far too easily . You're not allowed to talk to the armed guard but since this is the only rule you're allowed to do anything else to the guard , like use his gun . Since it's set in the future guards are now armed and there's been a plague of some sort and this ties in with the plot . It's amazing what you can get away with if you set your story in the near future with its mysterious plagues and armed guards and little touches like this constantly reminds you how contrived everything is and how the narrative would not possibly work if it was set in the present day . The fact that the film is so up itself means that the ending has to be explained word by word",Exam
8,view_and_review,"""What Would You Do?"" on Steroids",6,6 November 2021,"""Exam"" is a one-room movie that explores the human psyche. It's a ""What Would You Do?"" on steroids.Eight applicants are put into a room with 80 minutes to answer the one exam question, except there's no question seen on their exam sheets. They have to follow three simple rules or else they're disqualified:1.) Don't spoil your paper.2.) Don't try to communicate with the guard or the invigilator3.) Don't voluntarily leave the room.With these three known rules the test-takers began dissecting their environment around them as well as each other (figuratively) in order to find out what the one question is so they can give the one answer. It was both tense and annoying. You already know at least one character is going to grate your nerves, and in this case just about every character grated my nerves. Still, I was intrigued and I wanted to see the movie through to the end.",Exam
9,trashgang,more a thriller than horror,4,11 May 2011,"Exam is a hard one to review, I mean, I have found it at the horror shelves of a shop and it looked promising but I surely wont say it's a horror. It's more a kind of thriller instead. It's low budget of course because it takes place in one room and their is no gore or special effects in it. Naturally people will think that it is a rip-off of Saw but it isn't. It is explained why the exam took place but it is all a bit weird. The script is simple, you get a paper with one question on it, give the answer. By revealing the paper they see that there isn't anything written on it. As i said, it's low on the red stuff so it's more on the psychical factor. Being not what I suspected I kept watching it until the end. You could say that it was Saw without the traps or Cube without the rooms. Not that bad, believable cast but could have been more weirder by the players...",Exam
10,KineticSeoul,"Not as clever as it tries to be, but still a pretty intriguing film",6,16 October 2010,"The less you know about this movie the better, with that said this is a pretty witty movie about eight of the most talented candidates that reached the final stage and has to use there wits in order to win a chance to be selected into a mysterious corporation. And while doing so, they need to follow 3 rules. When the film starts it has people in a room with a paper in front of them and it's some sort of exam, taking exams is boring and watching other people do an exam is boring, so I wondered what they could possibly do in order to keep the movie entertaining. And it comes down to how far would you go for a job you really want badly. The movie is basically a game for the audience to figure out what the answer is and if you like that kinda stuff, this movie is for you. But if you easily get bored with bunch of characters stuck in a room arguing and just plain talking in order to figure the answer in a room than you might want to pass on this one. Some aspects of the movie I just didn't understand, because of the characters actions since it didn't make any sense. The negative aspects of this movie is that as the film goes on, the movie gets weaker and weaker and not as clever as it tries to be. The thing is, it could have gone anyway but it goes perfectly in the direction it wants it to go like the person that made the exam knew exactly what was going to happen. So in other words it tries to pull almost everything possible for 8 people in a room with a security guard while taking a exam. Not as clever as it tries to be, but still a pretty intriguing film.6.8/10",Exam
11,sddavis63,A Strange Way To Conduct A Job Interview!,5,8 December 2010,"For some reason I found this a very difficult movie to embrace. In fact, I made two false starts at watching it before I was finally able to sit through to the end. The truth is I'm not sure why I had that difficulty. This isn't a bad movie. I've sat through much worse. It's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it takes a very simple concept and manages to create a solid mystery and a fair bit of suspense and even mix in a few squeamish moments along with some actual violence. So it has a lot going for it. But something seemed missing in this.The story revolves around a group of 8 people who are the finalists for a position as the assistant to a mysterious high-powered CEO of a mysterious high-powered company. The one who gets the job will be the one who answers one question - the problem is that they not only have to figure out the answer, they also have to figure out the question while following a very specific set of instructions given to them. At first the group decide on co-operation in spite of the fact that they're competing against each other, but the competition grows more heated and intense as time goes on, and eventually an anything goes type of mentality emerges as the battle approaches its climax. So the movie combines the mystery with a somewhat bewildering mind game near the beginning as the applicants parse the comments of the invigilator and it ends up as an interesting study of group dynamics.I liked the fact that the movie made extremely good use of a very limited set. Everything - every single scene - takes place in the examination room. So it's a bare bones, bare budget movie - and that's fine. It works. The ending - the final resolution - seemed a little bit disconnected from the rest of the story unfortunately. Everything that had happened before suddenly seemed less than important as ""Blonde"" suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere figured out the question and answer. Overall, this was OK, but no better than that.",Exam

13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not quite an A star, but nothing below a B+",7,13 January 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Eight people enter a room and sit down at a desk, about to take an 'exam' having completed the gruelling first half of a big test. There is only one question, which none of them know of and certainly none know the answer to. They have eighty minutes to figure out the answer, and they must not speak to a guard stood in the corner of the room, spoil their test paper, leave the room or try and communicate with the people in charge of the test. But as events roll on, the tension mounts and the outcome becomes more dangerous, group dynamics and conflicting personalities combine to bring matters to a deadlier outcome than any of them could imagine.Exam is a small, more independent film that seems to have come out of nowhere, that is very similar to the premise around the cult classic Cube, and seems to have received the same slack distribution. Like that film, it's decidedly far fetched and outlandish, and only something someone with a really vivid imagination could have come up with. All the same, it's suitably tense and atmospheric through out, gradually developing as a story the more it goes on, becoming more and more intriguing and clever.Of course, the performances have to play a part in making it come alive, and so they do, most notably Luke Malby as a domineering, arrogant bully you yearn to see get his comeuppance, and Colin Salmon, appearing in only half a dozen scenes but still bringing that air of gravitas and presence to his role. Jimi Mistry pops up out of nowhere after a long time, throwing himself into his role as much as everyone else. It's not as good as Cube, and so it could come off as a poor man's version of that film, but that wouldn't be fair as on it's own it more than stands on it's own two feet. ***",Exam
14,bowmanblue,And I thought GCSEs were hard!,7,21 September 2014,"The Exam is an interesting little beast: filmed entirely in one room, eight applicants for a mysterious and powerful company have to sit their final entry exam. Only one will be employed. It quickly becomes apparent that all is not what it seems and shocks and surprises quickly follow.Okay, so The Exam is pretty low budget - any film set in the same, simply location is always going to be, plus you probably won't have heard of any of the actors (maybe Colin Salmon, but he's only 'the invigilator'). It's 'story-based' with us, the audience, being as in the dark as the applicants as to the company's true motives. It's mainly talking (and bickering!), but it's quite well done.There are plenty of twists in the tale - some you may predict (I didn't, but there seem to be some on internet message boards who have) and others you won't. It kind of reminded me of 'The Cube' with its simply setting and eight strangers trying to solve a puzzle of unknown origin.It's not perfect; there are a few moments where coincidence plays a big part in moving the story along, but, on the whole, I found it pretty clever and entertaining. I won't go into too much detail as much of the enjoyment is from finding things out as you go along. However, this could also be a drawback as, although I enjoyed the film, I'm not sure whether I could watch it again, as I'd know all the twists and turns before they came.If you like the sound of something a little more low budget and 'talkie' over action, then you might like this.",Exam
15,secondtake,"Terrific filming, a small-budget conceit, and a plot stretched to the breaking point",6,6 February 2011,"Exam (2009)What a bizarre movie. It's so beautifully filmed, almost virtuosic in its use of focus and close up and light, you almost forget that the plot is a highly contrived package of clever ideas. When you do think about the plot, and the various holes that open up in the logic of it, you are almost forced to enjoy it for the visuals. And for the acting, which has some real high points.You also marvel at how the entire movie is shot in a single room (with a glimpse of hallway a few times). I suppose you might bow to the film's makers for pulling off so much with so little. The result is intelligent and a little bit suspenseful at its best moments. When it begins it is absolutely fascinating, from the opening scenes establishing the characters to the first laying out of the rules (although there is a drama that reminded me for some reason of ""Deal or No Deal"" at its tackiest). Then some of the characters break out of the futurist mode and we have normal people vying to win the game, the contest to be hired by the mysterious health products company behind the scenes. (This part will remind everyone of a stylized and a bit false seeming ""The Apprentice"" even to the point that you might wish for a Donald Trump to appear from behind the dark screen and prod them along.)By the end, I think most people will either be a bit tired of it all, or mostly incredulous. It pulls out lots of tricks, and we are inevitably a little surprised by the final turns of events. But I'm not sure it lives up to the high standards set at the start. Get sucked in, sure, but be prepared to stick it out with effort.",Exam

""Exam"", by using the ""strangers in a room"" format, manages to create a fresh viewing experience on the tried-and- true psychological thriller convention.For a basic plot summary, ""Exam"" sees eight participants for a job interview brought together in a nondescript room and told to ""Answer one question"", although that question is not given to them. There are, of course, also rules for disqualification that they must closely abide by. When the door shuts and the timer begins, the applicants must work together (or possibly selfishly?) to solve the puzzle in front of them.""Exam"" combines many elements of the Twilight Zone (paranoia from ""Monsters on Maple Street"" & the ""where are we and what do we do now"" from ""Five Characters In Search of An Exit"") with the gritty feel of the ""Saw"" franchise. This is a combination that truly works and will keep you guessing until the very end. The overall mystery will suck viewers in initially, while the character/plot progressions will keep you glued to the edge of your seat for the duration.About the only reason I can't give this film the full five stars is because I did not particularly care for the ending. It isn't bad, by any means, but I was just expecting something so different that it kind of threw me for a loop. Please don't let this stop you from watching ""Exam"", however, as this is only a personal preference of mine...a friend I was watching the film with thought the ending was just fine.

20,filipemanuelneto,"It entertains very well, but has no logic at all.",4,9 February 2019,"I found this movie very good when I saw it, and still think it's interesting and has a lot of quality. For a low-budget film, with all the action restricted to an enclosed space and a limited number of actors, the film worked reasonably and has the ability to engage and entertain.The script is simple: a gray and impersonal room will be used by a large corporation to do the tests leading to the hiring of top personnel, and eight candidates will be subject to their last exam, under the watchful eyes of an invigilator and a armed guard. But the start of the exam reveals a surprise: the forms are blank, allowing the candidates to use all available means, without breaking the rules of the exam itself, to find out the question and give the corresponding answer.One of the best things about this film is that the whole plot is based on an effort of cooperation between individuals who are competing with each other. The idea is interesting, although not something new in the movies. There is a lot of psychological in this movie, where each character will reveal the best and the worst of themselves. The small cast did its work well, although without surprises or extraordinary merits. Personally, I enjoyed the performance of Adar Beck, Chukwudi Iwuji and Luke Mably, the latter having given life to the most unpleasant character in the film, very close to a conventional villain.The worst part of this film was the development of some script options, with improbable details and unreasonable situations. For example, the mystery around the company to which everyone seemed eager to work. That would never happen in real life. I would not send a curriculum to a company without, rather, knowing it in the slightest, however appealing the conditions might seem to me. Another rather irrational situation happens when everyone breaks the lights of a room without windows. Unless they knew there were more lamps somewhere, this is something that should only be done if the desire is to be totally in the dark. Oh, and we still have that moment when, almost completely forgetting that one of the rules of the exam was not to destroy the form, which is made of paper, everyone decides to soak the room by firing the water sprinklers from the ceiling, hoping it would not be water the liquid that would come out ...

A few superhero movies are fine; maybe one or two a year, but Hollywood is now putting out 1 every two weeks or 25 a year. That is way too many and is diluting the impact of the term superhero.

Real good.The mystery, and it is big mystery, is what keeps the suspense. And it keeps it throughout the movie, and at a high level at that. It has good help from well acted characters, that evolve and insert more into the mystery than they help solve it. To be honest I missed the solution, although it was possible to solve the entire time.

27,begob,Corporate propaganda,3,26 November 2014,"I've seen something like this movie before - lifeboat, twelve angry men, cube etc. But they're films where the characters are forced together, no choice.The modern take on strangers in a sealed box starts out, I guess, with trying to dramatise game theory with volunteers: my gain is your loss, for me to win someone has to lose, and I'm loving it.This film tries to soften it out by bringing in the irrational and compassionate elements, the notion of all-in-it-together, but it just ends up as corporate plonkers in an expositional fantasy.The characters are a variety, but there's no drama because the situation is nothing any group of people would choose to enter. Which seems to be the problem with game theory and economics in general, and possibly why we're ruled by financial shysters - they set the rules for the world, but the world ain't having it. Well, I'm not having it.And that final handshake from the strong, confident corporate woman in her mismatching business suit.

The film is set up nicely as you get to know each of the candidates. Most of them are pretty unlikeable and based on caricatures, in fact it is like watching an episode of The Apprentice at times. The acting is mostly just adequate though I thought Chukwudi Iwuji as Black was excellent. The film keeps you watching as you try and second guess the outcome but the ending is pretty disappointing.

39,dfa120374,"A Clever, Smart, And Enjoyable Psychological Thriller",6,17 August 2015,"After watching Exam I was pleasantly surprised at how well made and thought out both story and film were. I mean, after watching the trailer, there was always that worry that it would be another one of those movies that tries to be too clever but ends up being a bit of a nonsensical mess (The Box & Looper to name two such movies). Thankfully, Exam doesn't follow that path and it actually IS a clever film.The premise is a simple one...8 candidates are applying for the same highly paid position at a powerful organisation and all they have to do to finish the final selection process is to answer the question that is on their paper in front of them. Except there are no questions on either of the candidates papers. It's from here that they have to figure out what they can and can't do to successfully pass the exam.This is the moment that the film starts to get interesting as you, the audience, also try to figure out what it is the candidates have to do, and you become drawn into the whole process. This, for me, is what a good clever movie like Exam (and also another good ""thinker"" of a movie, The Cube) does...it draws it's audience in to make them feel as if they are a part of it all in some form or another.Exam makes you think; it makes you ponder; it makes the ol' brain box tick over as you try to figure out what it is the candidates have to do, and what their next step is. To help keep the smart story ticking along, there are a few twists and turns throughout, with the main one obviously being at the end.Exam is very well played out for the most part (there are a few moments here and there that you can tell some of the actors are TV actors) and while there are no stand out performances (well, maybe apart from Luke Mably as the annoyingly arrogant ""White""), they all do a very decent job.This movie is an excellent break away from the usual no brainer action films and mediocre horrors, and if you enjoy a good ""thinker"" then you won't go wrong with Exam.",Exam
40,Shattered_Wake,One of the best indie thrillers in years,8,7 January 2011,"In this economy, a good job offer is hard to find. So, when an exclusive position at a high-ranking corporation opens up, a group of talented recruits are quick to jump at the opportunity. As the grueling interview process winds down, the top eight participants are chosen to partake in a final exam. This exam is unlike any of them have ever seen, however. The invigilator (Colin Salmon) explains that the test is comprised of only one question to which there is only one answer. To add to the difficulty, the question isn't actually provided to the interviewees. Instead, the final eight must work against a ticking clock to not only answer the question, but actually make it out of the test room in one piece.A common approach that independent filmmakers will take for their low budget films is to write an entire script based out of only one or two settings. Films like the Ryan Reynolds vehicle 'Buried' or the French sci-fi horror 'Maléfique' were very successful at this style. Other films, like the 'Saw' ripoff 'Breathing Room,' are not as lucky. First time director Stuart Hazeldine, however, definitely manages to achieve success with this debut of 'Exam.' When it comes to doing a single-room film, it is very, very easy to let a film get boring or stale. To combat that, an entertaining cast, creative direction, and a well paced script are all major necessities. Take a film like 'Twelve Angry Men.' It's easily one of the greatest dramas in film history, and succeeds in its single-room premise by utilizing all of the aforementioned characteristics flawlessly. Somehow, shockingly, Hazeldine managed to expertly craft his first film, managing all of the aspects into a truly ejoyable & thrilling mystery. It will, without a doubt, guide him on his way to having a very nice future in this business.One issue the film does have comes from the acting. While the cast is by no means untalented, they are, for the most part, inexperienced. For that reason, some of the chemistry & timing by the actors is off. However, the experienced actors in the film, namely Jimi Mistry ('Blood Diamond') and Luke Mably ('28 Days Later'), do manage to hold things together to allow for a more-than-acceptable performance by the ensemble cast.The real power of the film, beyond Hazeldine's incredibly impressive direction, comes from his script. It is never, ever a bore, never cheesy, never overly confusing. It has a complexity in its character study while being vague in the actual storyline. The dialogue is all solidly written for the cast, always managing to be at least believable. The film is kept under a fog of mystery throughout allowing only necessary information at the exact right times. Too little information, and it can be frustrating for viewers. Too much, and it's no longer a mystery. Hazeldine kept a very nice balance here, and it definitely paid off.Overall, 'Exam' is one of the best independent films of 2010, and easily one of the best mysteries of the past few years. It is wonderfully directed, expertly written, and contains enough thrills to entertain just about anyone looking for it.Final Verdict: 8/10.-AP3-",Exam

The applicants all come in with similar assumptions and expecting a conventional school-type test despite having very different backgrounds for an executive-like job.All the technical aspects of the film are excellent (video, audio, FX, acting).

45,krachtm,Minimalist psychological thriller reminiscent of No Exit and Cube,8,7 April 2013,"The plot: Eight highly qualified applicants sit down to take an exam. The rules are simple, and there's only one question -- but nobody knows what the question is.Exam is a minimalist psychological thriller. It has a small cast, takes place in a single location, and is similar to existentialist plays, like No Exit. Ultimately, only one person can be the winner, but they all know they have to work together to solve the mystery. Their interactions, and the mystery of the exam, form the plot of the movie.If you like psychological thrillers, you've probably seen this sort of setup before. Cube is my favorite of this type, though Cube takes a much gorier approach. Like Cube, the characters are archetypes dropped into a highly stressful situation and pushed to their limits. It has the same mounting paranoia, conspiracy theories, and betrayal, leading to inevitable conflict. Some people might be a bit disappointed in what they see as an anti-climactic reveal or over-explained dénouement, but I thought they were handled fairly well.If you like talky, minimalist psychological thrillers, then I highly recommend Exam.

A group of people are at the final stages of the interview process to get a position at a mysterious corporation. They are put in a room with each getting a sheet of paper. The administrator tells them they have 80 min. to answer one question and there are only 3 rules. 1) Do not spoil your paper. 2)Do not talk to him or the armed guard at the door. and 3)Don't leave the room. When he starts the clock, they turn the paper over and it is blank.It's a stylized psychological thriller, and a pretty good one. We have seen similar set-ups before, Saw (2004) (the original saw, before all the idiotic sequels) comes to mind among others. This one was done quite well. All the actors gave decent performances, sometimes a little over the top, but it kind of worked considering we are told they are suppose to be finalists in a long, grueling selection process. What makes it most interesting is they keep the company a complete mystery all the way through, and as you watch the candidates devolve as time ticks away, you yourself keep trying to find clues as to the answer they are seeking.I do think the idea of these people devolving so much in 80 minutes is a tad far fetched and some of the things they figure out, try out, conclude, or don't is sometimes a bit unbelievable. But this is a movie so they couldn't just bore us to death like most real situations would. Also, as you are trying to find answers as well, it really makes these things a bit more unnoticeable.As a movie I give it an 8.

If you never saw a movie of such genre then you might be interested to take a look at Cube, which is probably the earliest film i know which tries to be a bare frame for the metaphorical discourse and and metaphysical views provided by the authors.But, if in Cube we were presented an allegory of the modern scheme of social interaction and role distribution, Exam is a much more narrowed down story about corporate power and what one can sacrifice to become a part of it. Eight contestants, all of which strive to secure a mysterious job position in an equally mysterious monster of a corporate world, are put together in a closed space with no rules but the rules of ambition and mischief, and are given 80 minutes to find an answer to a question which wasn't asked.This probably sounds like a pretty interesting and intriguing premise. And one has to give the film its due: the first two acts are very captivating, well-acted and mind-provoking. Of course, it's nothing existentially ground-breaking, but a concept of eight predators put in a single cage to determine the winner but forced to cooperate to win at all is very fertile ground for a gritty psychological thriller. And unlike aforementioned Cube, which went ridiculously over-the-top, with acting a hysteria contest and characters hardly more than stereotypes overblown, Exam keeps a firm and steady pace till the finale, holding that tricky balance between surreal and plausible, exactly the ingredient which is supposed to affect the viewer's mind and send it searching for a black cat in a dark room.Unfortunately, it takes a true wizard of cinematographic art to construct a high temple of suspense which would not collapse under its own weight in the very end. And while Stuart Hazeldine is clearly no amateur of such craft, his skills were a bit short to crown this film with an eccentric steeple, as the blueprints were promising us all along the way. With so many questions unraveled and conflicts unleashed before our eyes, the finale had to be equally simple, elegant and, at the same time, stunning for the whole film's construct to shine in its glory.Alas, while definitely being simple, the answer to the main question doesn't hold enough stunning charge. Instead, it feels like a bland trick the film played on us by quibbling through a tiny loophole it deliberately left for itself in case everything else fails but you still don't wanna come up empty and fold. And, in such case, it's usually better to admit that there was no cat at all than to claim it was there, sitting right in front of you, but you simply needed a microscope to see it.",Exam

The five candidates are given a piece of paper and a pencil to presumably write the question m answer within an 80 minutes time frame.

63,imagiking,Exam: Mildly Entertaining,4,30 June 2010,"Taking the tried and tested single-setting approach of many of its ilk, Exam plays out with a closed cast of characters, restricting itself to the strength of its script to impress its audience.The mystery-shrouded story of a job application process, Exam introduces us to eight candidates herded into a room to sit before a blank sheet each and provide the one answer necessary to get the position. The ensuing eighty minutes consist of the candidates desperately trying to discover the question they are required to answer and struggling to work together despite the uncertainty of whom they can trust.With a very gradual and slow start, Exam gives us time to meet our characters, examine the story they play a part in, and formulate an early impression of what is going on. By the time things get going, we are fully versed in the world immediately before us, though the deeper mysteries lie as yet unawakened. Thereafter, the film delves into some apparently recondite facts about the electromagnetic spectrum; facts which are explained in step-by-step-everybody-still-with-us?-fashion. In fact, the mental voyage of each character, and each theory they come up with in their quest to discover their task, is explained in achingly overbaked detail. At times, it seems as if writer/director Stuart Hazeldine doesn't expect much in the way of sentience from those who choose to watch his film. The film becomes less of a ticking-clock mystery thriller, and more of a tear-inducingly banal and basic science convention. When we finally reach the end of the spectrum (what pretty colours!), our characters all but give up, treating us to a full-on reductio ad absurdum series of fits of puerile pique and petulant pedantry. There does remain intact a nice underpinning of tension, mystery, and intrigue, though only just enough to keep our eyes trained on the screen. Despite the frankly annoying dialogue and twists in character, we do feel a desire to stick with things and discover just what is going on. However, this just leads to disappointment, the ending little more than silly, self-gratifying, and plainly irritating. The revelation of the question is more confusing than satisfying, many discussions here on IMDb ruminating on its validity, and whether or not it actually makes sense.Setting aside the already overly expatiated upon flaws in the characters' attempts to decipher their task, the film does provide a mildly entertaining eighty minutes. The tension created is passable, the edge of mystery acceptable, the slower scenes in the middle almost enjoyable. A man of science, I can't quite forgive its simplicity and technical liberties, but it's not awful. Not awfully so, anyway...",Exam

That's for sure. I felt bad for them, because the script gave so little room for creativity in character development, but they still didn't take ahold of what they did have, which made the film suffer. Each person lacked that extra pop you need to be on screen. This, I felt, hurt the intensity of the film. That would probably be the worst attribute in my opinion.

However, the filmmakers have converted this liability into an interesting tool that makes us feel like we are in a claustrophobic environment and hence we can connect with the feelings of the characters.There are eight candidates who have applied for a mysterious cooperation in order to obtain a lucrative job. In 80 minutes, the candidates are supposed to answer one question. However, mysteriously there is no question on the paper which completely astonishes everyone. Thus, they try various means to reveal the supposedly hidden question.The main motive of this film is to show how all humans can degenerate into horribly egoistic people who are completely indifferent to the plight of others when there is something important at stake. The acting is pretty good and in some ways the bonding and their interactions with one another seems to be inspired by 12 Angry Men. As the complete movie is set in a room, the director completely forces the viewers to focus on the story and not think too much about the technical aspects of the film.The ending is a little disappointing as it does not give a satisfactory answer to the various questions that arise through the course of this movie. There is a lack of clarity at how the conclusion should be interpreted which is a little frustrating because it was a pretty engaging thriller.I would suggest people to watch this if they are not dissuaded by the lack of action.",Exam

As I said, it is clever and Movies that makes you wonder about things are usually quite good, and this one is.

88,mohammadizadi-15812,Entertaining and disappointing,7,15 December 2020,"Okay, I won't deny that I found this movie to be entertaining and fun. The only regret I have is the fact that I didn't spend the 96 minutes I spent on this film on something better. The only reason that I probably won't recommend this movie to anyone is because there are so many better movies out there.But why didn't I love it? I mean I am a big fan of movies like this which have twists and turns and take place in a room and the characters have to solve a dilemma. So what went wrong with this one?
The answer turns out to be a lot of things.1- When you start watching a movie with the premise ""several people giving an exam"" or more specifically ""several people looking for the question they have to answer in said exam"" you expect the movie to be about that. to my recollection only half of the movie was about the question and the rest was backstory and small talk. Now that's not a big issue in other movies, but when the whole premise regards finding a question, I for one expect a bigger portion of the movie to be about this concept.
if you have seen ""Saw"" you know what I'm talking about. Two people are trapped in a room and have to escape. Of the 100 minutes ""Saw"" consists of, only 30 minutes of that time is dedicated to the whole 'escape' part. the rest is all flashbacks. ""Exam"" suffered from the same issue.2- The characters had notable personality swings throughout the movie. Some might accuse me of 'not understanding the depth of the characters' but frankly I'm just speaking my mind. Am I the only one who found it weird that one minute 'Brown' was against binding 'White' and disqualifying him from the competition, the next minute he was mentally and physically torturing 'Dark', and a few minutes after that he was basically willing to let 'White' die! In fact it's worse than that. considered the circumstances it's more of a murder than just letting him die.3- Guns with near-magical bullets that heal you?! I mean magical pills that heal you are plausible but why in the world would you put them in bullets?!?!4- Somehow the characters collectively managed to memorize exactly what the invigilator said at the start of the exam word for word.And last but not least, the biggest flaw in the movie: what if someone had said 'no' right at the beginning when the invigilator asked the ultimate question, something I may have randomly done in a similar situation? I'm envisioning something like this:Invigilator: any questions?Candidate X: no.Invigilator: congratulations! you have successfully passed our exam and proven your worth! We expect you to show up tomorrow at the office to begin your new highly desirable job which requires a lot of skill and intelligence!Ultimately it wasn't a bad movie in terms of entertainment, but you could use its plot as a golf course.

The movie had a nice premise, some candidates applying for a job, taking a test for a spot in a big company. It lacked exposition and it felt like I skipped half of the movie. The exposition would've done it a great favor, as this dragged forever and lost my interest by the end. A room full of smart people and a suck up blonde fighting for the prize resulting in the dumb blonde winning? Was this supposed to be a message for people overlooking things? The blonde won in the end by outplaying the opposition, sure, but it was a letdown the way i see it. I felt cheated (no pun intended) and really wished it had a different outcome.

He came close in that there is one reason to watch this movie and one not to watch it - to see the end.The movie started OK, leading you to believe it would be a clever puzzle but quickly went downhill from there. While the set remains the same they did keep it entertaining but the final question/answer was just ridiculous and the movie could have been saved if the writers invested enough effort into the ending as they did into the politically correct and racial stereotype of the characters. Also, was it just me that noticed that the first thing the movie does is to label each individual by race/gender and then make the ""white male"" (the politically correct crowds favorite whipping boy) the low life while everybody else had at least some redeeming qualities and the black person was like God. I have no problem showing black people in a good light, but I have nothing against whites either and would rather be color blind than to be like the writers and producers of this movie that feel they have to promote a politically correct negative stereotype based solely on race.

Some reviews I have read state that the movie is boring. I completely disagree. It is definitely slow-paced, but slow-paced does not mean boring; it means that the film is taking it's time building tension and is not in a rush to get to where it is going.

Guess which one will choose to use fisticuffs, torture, guns, sympathy, deceit, etc. It is intended to show the futility of the 'personalities' that are attributed to each race trying to work together in a zero-sum contest. Many people seem to miss that the rather human and intelligent characters are also caricatures because it is subtly done, though the movie hits you over the head with the nicknames.It kept me guessing through the film (and afterwards) who will be the winner? who is a plant? who is in charge? What do the designers of the EXAM want to happen here? When the CEO is revealed, which one will it be, or might it be the invigilator or the guard? One of the best questions is: for a corporation of limitless technology, what illusions are they purposefully creating in the EXAM room and why?Also, who is the corporation...really? what type of product do they have now? are they really this ruthless for their hiring? Are they a benevolent corporation (if there can be such a thing), or are they a cruel, profit-centric monster? They are so powerful that they are a nation-state, what does that mean?Did you listen to the words at the beginning of the EXAM? They rules are twisted like a lawyer would enjoy but each rule-breaker clearly breaks them and if asked would agree that they did! Did you hear that the laws of the outside world don't apply? What part of the outside world's norms will the characters maintain, and then do these norms help or hurt them with the EXAM?By the end, the writers have been able to squeeze every ounce of meaning from the words and events of those first 8 minutes.This would make a stunningly good live production.

But as someone who normally needs his wife to explain the plot after the end of each film, even I thought the identity of the 'mysterious' CEO was pretty obvious from an early stage.

127,JoelPeterBrown,Movie Review of 'The Exam' with an Ethical Dilemma,9,19 May 2015,"Your palms are sweaty as you grip the pencil that rotates between two fingers, on top of a piece of paper in front of you. While you sit in a conference room, amongst the final candidates for a highly desirable corporate job. Facing a dilemma, that will tell a lot about who you are based on the following question in mind. Will I save myself and sacrifice others or save others and sacrifice myself? It's a moral dilemma that we seem to face and answer through our actions, knowingly or unknowingly as we go about our day to day schedule. Whether it's at the coffee shop, or in a conference room. Regardless of the dilemma, if there's one thing I've learned from taking Christian Worldview and Culture its this. There's a moral law and nobody really keeps it, this follows the Law or Rule about Right and Wrong which is called the Law of Human Nature.Moreover; in the book 'Mere Christianity,' C.S. Lewis explains further, ""the Law of Human Nature. The idea was that, just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation, and organisms by biological laws, so the creature called man also had this law—with this great difference, that a body could not choose whether it obeyed the law of gravitation or not, but a man choose either to obey the Law of Human Nature or to disobey it."" This is why we need God to help us to do what we can not do on our own, because when we try to practice the kind of behavior that we expect from others we fail.There is a film titled 'Exam,' that I have watched as you can see this difficult ethical dilemma of 'saving myself and sacrifice others or saving others and sacrifice myself' in it that shows both the positive and negative consequences of this. IMDb describes this movie 'Exam' as ""The final candidates for a highly desirable corporate job are locked together in an exam room and given a test so simple and confusing that tension begins to unravel."" Why I chose this movie and the ethical dilemma that it displayed within it, was of the various different approaches that the film had in it to solving the same moral dilemma we face in life when it comes to working with people.Approach number one in the film, ""A young white man starts talking, stands up and convinces everyone to work together until they find what the question is. He also gives insulting names to the candidates according to their physical appearance, like Blonde, Deaf, White, Brown, Dark..."" said Krystel Claire. In which they all share their knowledge and help put forth ideas to find the question that is hidden somewhere on the paper as every attempt they make ends up not working out the way they thought it would, this solves the ethical dilemma of 'sacrificing self and saving others.' By each of them dropping their own agendas of figuring out the question as an individual, to collaborating with each other to make it a goal as a group. Which leads to the solving of the second part of the ethical dilemma, ""White deceived them by saying the group could collaborate until they guessed but after tricking Brunette into being disqualified each one begins to mistrust the others. As the tension builds to greater levels,"" said Krystel Claire. Once the backgrounds of the eight candidates get exposed, it seems like everyone starts to think more selfishly as this leads to such distractions as arguing and fighting that waste time and causes disqualifications. At times, blonde seems to be doing smart things in secret for herself to win the job like to keep her paper from being spoiled she puts it on her chair and then pushes it under the desk to protect it. While blond does appear to be doing things with the other candidates as a group, but individually shows the qualifications of what the CEO is looking for in a director like ambition, intelligence, drive, hard work and detail-oriented. ""Blonde enters the room again and picks up her paper. She fumbles with the pieces of Deaf's broken glasses and reads ""Question 1"" written on the watermark of the paper in very small print. She offers it to the invigilator and says ""no"", answering the question put forth ""Are there any questions?"". She is offered the job."" says Krystel Claire. Through this you can see how blond saves self and sacrifices others to get the job.The Biblical moral guidance that is relevant to this ethical dilemma comes from Proverbs 12:14, ""Well-spoken words bring satisfaction; well-done work has its own reward."" And Luke 6:31, ""Here is a simple rule of thumb for behavior: Ask yourself what you want people to do for you; then grab the initiative and do it for them."" I believe these scriptures help provide guidance to do the right thing, because it encourages generosity and the 'Golden Rule,' treating others the way you want to be treated.The Ethical Dilemma that was presented in this film was Save self and sacrifice others, or save others and sacrifice self.",Exam

129,d_in_chi,A fun thriller that falls apart at the end,6,22 March 2014,"I am a huge fan of the ""Strangers Locked in a Room"" subgenre, and I love films shot in real time, so this movie got my juices rolling from the get-go.We're presented with a rather absurd situation, but not in an overly corny way: eight job applicants are placed in a room for an ""exam"" of sorts, presented with a puzzle for which there seems to be no solution and given 80 minutes for one of them to step up and earn the job. Most of the action takes place in real time as the clock winds down to 0.I don't believe I'm spoiling anything by saying I spotted the answer before the clock started, having been presented this very same problem by a crafty teacher in the second grade, but I still had my doubts throughout, and the film is nonetheless clever and crafty in its own right, and being in suspense of the ending matters little. Much like another real time film, ""Rope,"" dialog and personalities carry the piece, although in that film you're ""in the know"" from the first few seconds.Our ten characters are, with a couple of exceptions (""Brunette"" is far too hammy and ""Dark"" reminds me of a third rate CSI scientist), very well acted, and the film runs as an entertaining piece of pure theater. There's little to summarize about the plot; as you may well guess, within minutes the confined begin to run through all the typical stages of the locked-in-a-room syndrome, beginning with confusion and ending with near-chaos. This film had all the makings to be an absolute home run, but the thrills and suspense that it builds, very well I might add, are kicked to the side for a softball ending. It touches on horror slightly at one point, not quite going all the way, easing into the finish like a passenger jet descending from cruising altitude to landing speed. In a way, I felt kind of like you do when you finish a test and have 15 minutes to spare... you begin to get slightly dozy. Without the condemnation aspect seen in films like ""Saw"" or ""9 Dead,"" (this is merely a job, for crying out loud), it's difficult to generate extreme thrills, and the somewhat lazy plot device about the unnamed disease doesn't help much. I'm also not quite sure the writer of the story knew how they wanted to end it, or at least they didn't have the creative inspiration to finish as they did to start. They may have even had a change of heart or experienced some warm and fuzzy life happenings while finishing up the screenplay. But I don't blame them... finding a creative and thrilling ending and maintaining the early momentum seems near impossible.Nonetheless, the first 75 or so minutes feels like 20 and overall the film will not let you down.

If I wanted psycho drama I can always go to a therapist.Frankly the answer is I would not work for such a company no matter how high the salary. Of all the characters though I think the right one ended up with the job though. The only question that is asked is: are there any questions? and the answer is yes lots of questions. why would any company risk their future on someone who could and would submit to a process such as this?

135,samfran94,"It's a Pass, but not with Flying Colours",6,14 February 2014,"Stuart Hazeldine had only one directorial credit to his name before this (the 35 minute short 'Christian', for anyone whose interested), but does a decent job with a relatively unknown cast and modest budget. In fact, the only actor I recognised apart from Colin Salmon (who appears in a cameo role), was Jimi Mistry. Nonetheless, the cast do the movie justice, and while its not going to break box office records or light up the world of Hollywood, at just over 90 minutes, it's entertaining viewing that I'd definitely recommend to others.To me, the movie seemed almost a hybrid between 'Phonebooth' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. 8 Candidates are summoned to a sit an exam determining which one of them will receive a position in a lucrative organisation. They are given 80 minutes and are told that they cannot communicate with the invigilator (Colin Salmon), leave the room or spoil their paper. They only have one question to answer, except all they are given is blank sheets of paper. Admittedly I realise that this may sound pretty boring but give it a chance and a lot of tension actually builds. The action all takes place within the exam room, and the candidates do not use their real names (much akin to Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs') but the prize of the job pits them all against each other in a race against time to find the answer and then to solve it. Instantly, also like 'Reservoir Dogs, they all grow suspicious of each other and accusations and insults fly rapidly around the room.The room becomes a theatre for clashes of personalities, as well as holding secrets of its own. By restricting his story to this condensed location Hazeldine effectively creates a sense of claustrophobia where the audience, like the characters, feel trapped by the ominous presence of the room and those who are examining them. OK, so it's not brilliant and it's probably not a movie I would watch again. Nonetheless, I feel its positives probably outweigh its drawbacks. The job itself which the candidates are applying for, and their circumstances, I felt became ridiculously complicated in places. I also think that the ending, whilst not disappointing,was not exactly what I had been hoping for. It didn't really provide the 'killer blow' I was expecting, and actually left me feeling rather deflated. However, I must stress that 'Exam' is worth 90 minutes of your time. It will keep you on the edge of your seat at times, and even had me rooting for my favourite for the job. Stuart Hazeldine shows plenty of promise by creating an interesting psychological thriller and character study without the backing of a major studio, which is an encouraging sign for British film and independent movie makers around the world!",Exam

143,lewismillican,Exam is as ambitious as it is surprising,7,26 January 2021,"A mysterious and somewhat philosophical production surrounding elements such as greed, guilt, power and intrigue. Exam is as ambitious as it is surprising but is sitting yet another exam worth an hour and a half of your life when you thought they were all over?An Exam?Nine applicants enter an examination room to complete a test for a seemingly incredible job. If this is no aptitude, cognitive or numerical test then what is it? Each applicant is provided with only a piece of paper with their candidate number on. They then have to hear the invigilators rules and get to work on trying to find an answer, solution or any sort of deductive reasoning to the exam.Shot in a nondescript, fairly sleek yet impersonal examination room, it is actually used as an allegorical platform on which the director builds the plot in search for answers. The first act is fairly rudimentary in its approach, we learn and get to grips with who the applicants are at a superficial level and their influences. As options are narrowed the candidates' true motives come into play and as individuals quickly degenerate into delirium the room starts to become more uncomfortable.The Direction and EnsembleWith a fairly unknown cast, the director pushes each and every actor to their limits on a physical and emotional level, and in doing so he unearths some great performances. Most notably from the sexist, misogynistic narcissist 'White' played by Luke Mably. Alongside such surprising performances is the incredible level of anticipation and excitement that is almost visible in such a small space. The utilisation of this small space only heightens the anxious atmosphere within the room making it into what can only be described as a hotbed of anticipation. There is never a dull moment as first-time full feature director Stuart Hazeldine holds his own in both the pacing and tone of this film. With just the right dosage of twists and turns, Exam never wanders into the realm of 'suspension of disbelief', everything always stacks up and walks the line perfectly.The One SetAs these reviews have known to discover, in order to have a truly unique and successful film set entirely on one set it comes down to two main factors: concept and performance. Although the concept is fabulous and other elements are so clearly introduced which make it intriguing enough, Exam still can't push itself into the upper echelon of one set films. It is most certainly watchable enough and the various elements discussed make it a worthy entry to the list but it cannot quite push into the top.",Exam

I have a hard time concentrating when watching movies, I often turn my attention to something else and because of that I get lost in the plot. Some movies though, manages to keep me focused on the movie the entire time and this was one of those movies. I love a good mystery, where the movie makes you really think. When you try to solve the mystery (this time, the question) yourself. So I stayed focused every minute and it never got boring.

146,manuelwinchester,Solve the riddle and find the meaning,8,10 August 2018,"If you have ever felt stressed about an exam, then you will soon come into play with ""Exam"" and sense your body shivering from spontaneous anxiety. The whole film resembles a riddle which demands an answer, so the audience could participate in the way of every respectable mystery-film. But here, the newcomer Stuart Hazeldine turns out to create something which will literally put the audience inside a bizarre multicoloured lighted examination room. So, let's pick up the pens and answer the impossible; solve the riddle without breaking the strict rules. The participation in this film is like a video game or a live Skype job interview if you prefer. The creator of this film achieved an utter interaction between the screenplay and the audience which renders this film actually entertaining in a matter of fact. It is a tendency now that every movie shot in one place, especially in a room, become highly appreciated. ""Exam"" offers a live angst on solving the unsolvable among a bunch of stereotypical characters each one with a role to play and decisions to take. Hazeldine distributes clues throughout the movie and even his excellent close and personal frames betray a diligent job. As for the cast of the unknown actors ordered to capture a team of unique, intelligent and cliched people fighting and showing off for a place next to the God of opportunities, I believe they hit the nail on the head with sincere performances. The agony of the countdown shadows flaws and plotholes and further enriches the suspense of the easily predicted future uncomfortable escalations. Inside a room with specific rules and a motive of surviving of the fittest, people, despite how different their origins or culture or intelligence is, they have no differences; Thus, the way they strive for gaining the power to outweigh the others by automatically activating their inner competitive nature, seems extremely intriguing. Besides the hints about colossal medical enterprises and the bioethical questions deriving from there, ""Exam"" has another less obvious message about an individual's behaviour under special circumstances opening a philosophical and psychological dialogue at the same time. Overall, the proper mystery atmosphere and a respectful befuddlement plot are enough to like the movie, but the revealing of the multiple hidden implications is enough to praise a fresh artist",Exam

The twist however is once the time starts ticking, the paper is revealed to be blank.

It was even at time hard to watch as there was part of the film where the character ""Dark"" almost gets her eye scratched from her test paper. Was definitely a thrilling film to say the least and it also did a good job at adding a psychological element to it.The only thing The film I felt lacked on was the ending, I felt it was a little too long because the answer was revealed yet it took another 10 minutes or so to finish upOther than that I was impressed by how simplistic the film was in terms of scenery (takes place mainly in one room), how it was able to keep me as a viewer interested all the way through, and the mind boggling answer revelation that flew over everyone's head at the very start.Overall underrated gem of a film👍",Exam

This film could have been made as a reaction to the numerous reality shows now out there; in fact, it resembled an extreme version of The Apprentice. The opening shots are nicely done - close ups of individuals getting ready for the 'exam'. The shots are intrusive and intimate but without giving anything away about the characters other than a few obscure physical details.The film plays out in one room all the way through. Don't let this put you off. The actors and situation their characters find themselves in is the perfect blend for this story. We watch as secrets begin to unfold, personalities threaten to shatter the team structure they build, and things quickly become dark as the candidates become desperate. It very much becomes a personality show - who will crack first under the pressure? Who will resort to extreme measures to ensure they get the job? It is a test of human behaviour in a claustrophobic situation where we witness a turnaround in events once the relationships begin to crack under the pressure.The audience will find themselves asking the same questions as the candidates throughout the film and wondering how it will finalise. It is well worth watching if only to find out who ends up with the job and what they go through to get there!",Exam
156,zarajasmin1586,Good buildup but badly concluded,5,30 July 2012,"The movie was really solid in the first half but continues to try my patience the closer it gets to concluding. The plot is not entirely original but well-executed. The concept was interesting and as the story progresses, you start to care about what happens to the characters as much as what the answer to the question is.I don't know if it's because the genre is psychological thriller which made me pay more attention to the nuances or if they've failed in being subtle but I figured out the answer (and what the question is) almost immediately. Still, I did hope that the ending would prove me wrong because it couldn't really be THAT simple (but I was right). So for me, the core of the movie (what is the question?) failed to intrigue. Indeed, it only served to disappoint so that's a mark against it for me.How about the ending itself? The revelation of the magic pill was a little too scifi-y for my tastes. Also, I feel dissatisfied with how the person won since 1)the CEO cheated by messing with the timer and 2) the winner was mostly passive and in the end seem to win through sheer luck.What I do like about it are the characters and the pacing. I like the fact that you get to see layers of the characters being peeled off and revealed as the story progresses. They start off as being stereotyped (quite literally, in fact) but as the saying goes, there is more than meets the eye and you realise that as soon as you think you've got one character pegged, s/he surprises you again. The pacing was good too, since it keeps your attention even though everything happens on one location only.Overall, it was a good movie but sort of crashed and burned at the end.",Exam

He outlines three rules they must obey or be disqualified: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room.Well one thing I really like about this film, Is that it's a well-made British Psychological thriller and the director/writer as chosen nine brilliant actors and actress to deliver tension, exciting film. Exam is a dialogue-heavy piece, so if you like you're thriller films with some action you wouldn't find it here but don't let that put you off at the end of the day, it's still an exciting and interesting piece from start to finish and work brilliantly as a play. It's very intriguing but I can't go into more detail about the film because it would give it all away and the whole point of watching is seeing how the candidates deal with their situation. And how! Most of the cast get a fair crack of the whip in the script and there are dark times ahead as the work through every possible permutation to get to the answer.One of the most impressive things is how the Director Stuart Hazeldine gives the audience more info on every character with great detail through the process of the film. Being that there nine main character, that not easy task to achieve especially character that you want to win or lose. I really like the fact, there was a ""reservoir dogs"" type moment with Luke Mably's character giving out codenames like blonde, brunette, white, black, brown, Chinese, Dark and deaf.just basic around their descriptors. And top marks goes to writer/director Stuart Hazeldine for his directorial debut, since this is the type of film where anyone could easily paint themselves into a corner and not know how to get out of it, but not only does he manage that, he also comes up with, what I can only describe as, the perfect ending.Overall the film is a great Psychological thriller, which given us some brilliant actors/actress also had one of my favourite ending to a film.

163,Incisive,Exciting Beginning - Disappointing Ending,7,10 November 2011,"Here is my take on this movie, and what it could mean for you.The movie starts exciting, and has an interesting premise. It's a fact that large corporations and investment banks often have an over-the-top or outside-the-box interview process. This movie keys off that BIG time.The beginning intrigues you and draws you in, because it seems like a no-nonsense thriller with a psychological twist embedded in it.Unfortunately, the characters- every single one- are annoying to the extreme. Here's a brief detail of them:1. Arrogant, outspoken guy you love to hate 2. Crazy, emotionally unstable guy who tries to be everyone's buddy, then winds up getting shot 3. Boring, empty-headed, useless chick who ends up winning despite showing no valuable character traits or initiative whatsoever (huge let down) 4. Cheesy gambling guy who has a shallow veneer of mystery 5. Stereotypical shrink who wears nerdy glasses (of course) and does absolutely nothing except spew trite one-liner psycho-babble 6. Babbling, bumbling freak who disqualifies himself and turns out to be the CEO in disguise (yawn- I predicted this in the first half of the movie) 7. Chick who tries to be ""tough guy"" and go toe-to-toe with arrogant loudmouth 8. Utter dummy who violates an explicitly spoken rule in the first few minutesAs usual, this film portrays human interaction at it's absolute worst. There was no peaceful productive exchange, respectable leadership, or sense of team work. At best, it was 8 stragglers battling over petty power trips, or half-baked ideas.Like I said, I really enjoyed the beginning, when the drill sargeant executive laid out the ground rules and basic instructions. This scene got me all excited.Ultimately, it's the end that killed it for me. The chick who ""solves the puzzle"" had to be the least thoughtful out of all the participants. And suddenly in the blink of an eye she suddenly becomes ""wise"" and figures out the riddle. Then there are hero shots of her walking on air and playing hard to get. It just seemed silly at that point.In the end, I give it a 6 because I LOVE the premise... it's just the prestige could've been dealt better.",Exam

165,iandaviddavies,Horrendous film,1,4 February 2012,"This film was awful, at the end I felt as if the writer desperately tried to weave together a smart revelation type ending but instead it turned out to be a logic-less mess; further more I find it lazy and border line racist that the characters were colour coded according to race and physical appearance... this is no reservoir dogs. At certain points during the film each character in turn would churn out some lazy stereotypical backstory that does nothing to warm you to the characters but instead re-inforces your ever growing contempt for the film. In short I would honestly rather spend 96 minutes sat in silence on a cold train station platform waiting for the last train to hell then watch this film again.",Exam

Exam is a low-budgeted film, which has 8 main character, a guard, and an invigilator. Despite of the said budget, It was able to give me a solid plot, awesome acting and great ending. Though the movie do not have a lot of gore scenes (I guess none at all), nor lots of screaming and killing. It was still great. It will keep you guessing and guessing and, simultaneously discovering the characters background, this movie is not boring at all, It'll keep you thinking and wait to see if your guess is right.

If they talk to the guard, or to the camera monitoring them, they are escorted out, one by one. They suspect at least one of them is a plant for the company, and not an actual candidate. It gets pretty intense, since no one knows what is expected of any of them, or what the question is that they're supposed to answer. So, they try to think of every possible ruse to reveal the truth. Consider it a minimalist setting, but I thought the premise worked well, and the twist at the end got me. Give this movie a chance, if you are tired of chases, guns, and brute strength being displayed. There also aren't any zombies in this one, for once.",Exam

The development of the events was not interesting at all .. I got bored of the story so quickly ..The way they were trying to discover the nature of the question and the way they tried to disqualify each others were ridiculous and boring .. And the actors were so bad that I couldn't understand where they stood from what is happening .. The way they reacted for extreme things such as the act of homicide was shallow as if they were a group of killers not ordinary people in an interview for a job!! And right before the end of the movie when you think that it can't get worse I was surprised with what considered to be the twist at the end .. Not because of the twist itself of course, but because it made me hate every second I had wasted on watching this movie .. A silly twist that didn't add nothing at the end and demonstrated how miserable the movie was ..

177,Weker,A film with an interesting concept but fails on so many levels.,3,10 April 2015,"The film opened up giving me high hopes with an enjoyable slice of cinematography that is reminiscent of other films, however as I continued, bit by bit it chipped away my hopes for the film.During the film rules are quickly set up, making it clear what the characters are able to do with a set of rules and not other outside rules apply. The characters act understandably at first but quickly just seem to ignore what any normal person would do, the characters are all established to be highly intelligent and also deductive but fail to take notice of blatantly obvious things. Characters also quickly establish themselves as arch types. The male characters are quickly shown to have clear personalities however many of the female characters seem to have had little written for them other then one being an information dispenser who for the majority of the film is just a robot. In general it is well acted however the actors seem to have been given both a poor script and directions.Even with plot holes ignored and the ending, the film is largely just several strong archetypes having very simple mind games with each other. Several times during the film I was able to call out certain outcomes before they happened as the characters are highly predictable. Without my opinion of the awful story I would describe the film as a 4 out of 10 instead, however with it included I would say a 3.Below is spoilers for the film and where most of the plot holes or just stupidity of the story is mentioned.What was the answer to the question? Well there was only one question asked during which was ""Any question"" and so the answer ""No"" was correct. My eyes practically rolled out the sides of my head in grimace. The statement of there only being one question which can only be seen through two layers of glass with only two people wearing glasses in the room. Many of these plot holes are just a list of question but I feel ultimately show how the film only works because the characters are written to have it work rather then having any sort of understandable logic to it.What was the purpose of hiding ""Question 1."" on the paper when they already said there was one question? Why make it so difficult to see? What would have happened if White stabbed Black in the eye with a pencil to kill him rather then man handling the guard to shoot him? Why would they destroy not only the lights but also the emergency lighting before checking the clock, one of the only clear objects in the room with two distinctive buttons? Were they meant to discover who Deaf was so they could tell him no? They were given no way to reply unless they knew as they were not allowed to communicate with the invigilator. Would Deaf be revealed at the end if they had all just waited and then expected to answer? How did everyone ignore deaf fiddling with the clock, if it did not at least draw attention should they at least be concerned about him messing up the test for them? What would have happened if anyone answered no to the question before the test started? Would it not count as the test had not started yet? Would they be removed for communication with the invigilator even while giving the correct answer?",Exam

179,brotherSpooky,You Have Failed the Exam,6,28 June 2020,"'Exam' is one of those movies that looks smarter than it actually is. The plot is intriguing, but all the details doesn't quite add up. We are given the presumption that all the characters are unique and highly intelligent, yet their actions seem to speak otherwise. Besides the information they say, they don't show any unique skills why they were chosen for this particular test. I can say that the characters were little bit shallow, and poorly developed. The story itself delves into already familiar territory of psychological games and plot twists of 'mind bending movies'. The writers took too big bite and weren't clever enough for themselves to really surprise the 'seen a lot' viewer. Nonetheless, the movie manages to attract and then keep the viewer's attention. Acting is hammy at spots but the pacing is fine and the atmosphere is consistent. The directing is good and one can say, that the visuals are quite stylish.'Exam' is nothing to get overly excited for, but it is consistent and entertaining enough.

If you are acquaintanced with these kind of tricks you'll just get it from the start. Just like any magic trick, it distracts your attention using all kind of schemes and maneuvers in order to keep you distracted. That's how it kind of felt like to me.While from the start the movie seems to deliver a mature, realistic (credible even!) story, it ends with a ridiculous shootout, but it turns out those are magic bullets that were shot, that actually heal people.So the beginning suggests a 12 Angry Men kind of movie, but it ends with a random action scene surrounded by a unrealistic plot twist, backed up by an undeveloped story presented in just a few phrases.But that's not even the worst aspect.
SPOILER: The question in the movie is - 'Do you have any questions?' And then... oh my God... the woman answers ""No, I do not have any questions"". And it takes 2 minutes or less for her to say ""But now it's over, I have questions"". Oh my God... she...gave the wrong answer - so while this movie makes you feel like it's smart and it somehow 'got you', it actually ends with a deplorable failure.She found the question, but gave the wrong answer...

In this movie the responsible for the selection process is redeemed at the end. We see violence, torture and murder, being every single one an accomplice. But at the end all this is justified because it serves a better good. What a childish, happy ending. The movie presents an unlikely selection process, with non-credible stereotypic characters. The acting is not very good either, with uninteresting dialog, and a shallow approach to the problem. The resolution is poor at most, and the surprise element, not shocking.

I had not seen a trailer but had heard a (very) brief description of the movie which sounded like it was going to be either genius or lackluster hit or miss but i was quite intrigued to figure out which one.The movie did not fail to deliver, ""suspense"" is probably the word to describe this film, if you manage to stay awake through the first 6 minutes from that moment on the script and actors have you sucked in and trying to figure out the answer with them as the clock ticks down. I found the characters to be very captivating and in many instances found myself rooting for the bad guy, the one they want you to hate, i find UK films are great at developing relationships between the viewer and characters more so than the U.S As one would assume this is the sort of work that is set up to have a pretty big twist or turn at the end, and though to not so extreme, you are kept guessing until the last second.Their is a lot of debate about the legitimacy or logic of the given answer, but i think when you look deeper at the group dynamics of the exam and the explanation given by the exam conductor at the end of the movie it all makes sense .We all have at least 1 friend who will love this movie and that we will recommend it to, you know that guy who loves riddles and thinks they have all the answers .Overall i rated this one, and although its not ground breaking its a must watch and a gripping/entertaining 90 minutes.RATE. 7.7",Exam

Though it really doesn't look like it will be worth watching at first glance, the journey of the characters and competitive desire to answer the examiner's question before they do keep you gripped. There is also a refreshing lack of gore rarely found in horror films I've seen and the plot focuses more towards the personality of each character and how they interact with each other as a result. My one criticism would be the stereotypical nature of some of the characters. It is obvious, for example, that White is not a pleasant character because of ingrained preconceptions and the speed with which his personality is revealed leaves no chance for the audience to question these. However, I would recommend this film to any horror fan willing to overcome its relative lack of violence.",Exam
194,tayritch,I absolutely loved this movie. Wish I could find more like it!,9,6 November 2012,"Let me start out by telling you how much I loved this movie. It was smart and intense, without being too terribly intricate. It starts out with a handful of ""candidates"" taking an exam in a windowless room for a prospective job with a prestigious company. That is all the information you are given about the characters and the company (although more details come out throughout the course of the film). They are given blank pieces of paper, a time limit, and a set of simple instructions, and that they have to answer the question given to them--only to discover that their papers are blank.The rest of the film is dedicated to them trying to figure out what the question is. At first, they try to help each other, but throughout the film, the candidates become almost ""Lord of the Flies"" -esque, turning on each other as more details about the company and the individual candidates are exposed.Although the entire film takes place in one, singular room...the atmosphere is intense and had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through. The characters are well-developed, the pacing of the film is spot-on, and the climax and ending of the film was everything I could've hoped for. I cannot say anymore without ruining it, so my advice is to just watch it. I, myself, felt like I was there in the room, trying to piece together the puzzle and figure out what the question is. I kept looking for clues or things I could've missed. Every time I thought I had it figured out, another twist would present itself.For a low budget thriller, this was superb.

197,Quasi_mofo,Good Premise Poorly Executed,2,6 December 2014,"This is a film which manages to hold your attention only because you want to find out how it ends not because of the story itself. What makes films like this interesting is the people themselves; who they are and why they've found themselves together. However this film only briefly discusses that and instead focuses too much on what they do. There is very limited character development, a not a single sympathetic character that we care about. The female characters in particular are completely bland and appear to only be there because the film is trying to be politically correct by having equal numbers of men and women. The film starts with 8 people in the room when even it knows there's only enough space for 4.It feels like an idea that would work well for at most 1 hour but is stretched out too long. It's just over 90 minutes long. The first 45 minutes should be condensed into about 15.The quality of the acting is also pretty poor. The lead actor seems to just be doing an imitation of Danny Dyer and the rest of them are extremely stiff and unnatural with the exception of 'Black'. This might be partly due to a poor script, however in the well-written, interesting parts of the script, the quality of the acting remains just as poor, so I personally blame the actors.Then there's the ending which is the dumbest ending I can remember seeing to film. It feels extremely lazy like the writers just went with the first idea they thought of and it leaves the viewer extremely unsatisfied. The revelation alone was an atrocious way to end the film but the scene following it is just laughably bad, and ruins almost all of the few good things about the film.It's not completely without merit. As I've already mentioned 'Black' (Chukwudi Iwuji) is decent, especially when compared to the rest of the cast. The writing at parts goes in quite edgy and interesting directions, but always quickly returns back to the central premise, which is a shame, and perhaps that is why the viewer is left especially disappointed.",Exam

Imagine making an entire movie about that riddle.The point of this movie is that ten good actors can effectively illustrate the ignorance of contemporary consumers of psychological thrillers.The premise is that eight job applicants have made it through a rigorous sequence of screening processes and earned themselves the opportunity to sit for a test which will presumably determine whether or not they get employed as an assistant for the CEO of a pharmaceutical company.They have 80 minutes to complete the test.They are each given a sheet of paper with ""Applicant __ "" printed on it, and a set of simple, verbal instructions.The sheet of paper has no other writing on it.Things start off interesting, because the token white male (who naturally is an asshole and a hypocrite) figures out some interesting things about the instructions for the exam. Then things go down hill.The allegedly outstanding candidates quickly start to flip out because they don't know what the question to the test is.The characters, who have for some reason given themselves ""code names"", set about breaking things-- the viewer is supposed to regard this stupid behavior as a reasonable attempt at problem solving.One of the candidates breaks one of the rules by communicating with the guard by flipping him the bird. The candidate is not thrown out of the exam due to shoddy writing.Predictably, the candidates become paranoid and resort to violence.In the end, the viewer learns that the writer of this movie believes that impatience, rash behavior, following the group, whining, and not recognizing a trick question when you see it are all qualities which pharmaceutical companies desire in an employee.The acting was great, which made the movie engrossing and I would even say it was worth watching for that reason. The premise of the whole thing being a job interview however, required a level of suspension of disbelief which is likely only possible for people who do not know what it is like to work extremely hard to achieve something such as an outstanding test score or employment at a highly competitive job.",Exam
204,stickyfantastic,"generic, cringeworthy",4,22 April 2017,"i love movies with concepts like this one but they've been done to death, and i especially hate movies like this one when it's the most clichéd piece of film you can find on netflix.speaking of racism let's talk about the annoying overdone stereotypes this film has in it. of course the one (only) attractive white guy is sexist, racist, rude, impatient, etc. the Indian'a the ""nice"" one despite looking and acting like a compete d-bag. the black guy is super religious, the nerd is supposedly autistic, i can go on.the plot is pushed along and nothing comes naturally. none of the character's ideas are their own, and their observations they make in the film are very obvious. it's like, these are supposed to be really smart highly skilled people applying for the job and they all have the mentality of immature 9th graders. i really don't like this film. it's just not entertaining and honestly it's really rude. it makes me want to spit on the person who made it.",Exam
