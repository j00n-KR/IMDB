0,claudio_carvalho,The Haunted House,4,4 November 2019,"In Illinois, six college friends celebrate the Halloween party in a bar. They decide to visit an isolated haunted house in the middle of the night but soon they realize that the dreadful live shows are for real.""Haunt"" is a violent and overrated slasher movie that may entertain fans of the genre. However the illogical screenplay and characters are poorly developed and unoriginal. There is no explanation for the motives of the brutality of the crazy people from the haunted house. The rushed conclusion is also absurd. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Haunt
1,nogodnomasters,Earn Your face,8,20 October 2019,"Harper (Katie Stevens) attends college in Carbondale, Ill. (Filmed in Kentucky.) We later discover she has abusive daddy issues as she breaks up with her abusive boyfriend Sam (Samuel Hunt). A group of college kids out on Halloween night decide to go to an extreme haunted house.This is one of many haunted house horror films. I am a sucker for these, rarely finding one I don't like. I enjoyed this too. Not overly heavy in blood and gore.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Haunt
2,kosmasp,A break,8,1 November 2020,"Halloween Haunt (as it is called in Germany) needs to get a break from you. And by that I mean: suspend your disbelief! You really have to! Because if you don't ... just the fact our main characters visit or enter the house will break the movie for you (no pun intended).Having said that, once you are into the movie and start guessing about the villains (or are they?) of the movie, the movie will take you on a ride. Quite a few nice effects and an overall interesting idea! Though again, you can never think too much about certain things (the word why should never enter your mind for example) ... and then there is the ending! Completely over the top and makes little sense I reckon ... but in a weird way quite satisfying!",Haunt
3,Sleepin_Dragon,Brutal.,7,6 November 2020,"There have been multiple films in this genre, and as each year passes, they seem to get more and more lame, I didn't expect much.What a surprise Haunt was, genuinely unnerving in parts, lots.of scares, plenty of surprises. Best part for me has to be where there is a realisation by the group of thrill seekers what exactly is going on in that house.I really liked the start, it gives you a flavour of the tone, I thought the ending could have perhaps been a little better.Overall, way better than it should have been. 7/10.",Haunt
4,BA_Harrison,Stop clowning around and give us some gore.,6,18 September 2019,"Haunt is a reasonably entertaining horror film, but as seems to be the case with most movies that Eli Roth has a hand in (he's one of the producers), it doesn't live up to all the hype (SO many glowing reviews here on IMDb). The fairly routine set-up - a group of friends enter an 'extreme' haunted house and find themselves hunted by the characters within - allows directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods to create a palpable sense of dread with their ominous Halloween attraction, but they blow it all with a collection of bland victims and a lack of inventive kills with very little gore.Considering all of the opportunity for intense horror that the creepy locale provides, there are surprisingly lame fates in store for our cookie-cutter characters, with death by pitchfork and hammer failing to provide the creative splatter. For such a weird looking bunch of psychos (their faces more scary than their masks), the antagonists sure aren't very imaginative when it comes to the kill, which makes the film less effective overall. The first half of the film works best, when the viewer is still on edge about what horrors await those who enter the haunted house; the second half, when the disappointing kills actually take place, is far weaker.Haunt does end on a high with final girl Harper (Katie Stevens) turning the tables on one of her attackers, but It doesn't stop me from chalking this one up as an also-ran.",Haunt
5,BandSAboutMovies,Not half bad,5,21 September 2019,"Scott Beck and Bryan Woods co-produced and wrote A Quiet Place before this film, which follows the framework of past movies like Hell Fest and The Funhouse, movies where haunted houses and sideshows house real killers. Eli Roth is the producer of this film, if that helps or hinders your decision to watch this.With nothing to do on Halloween, a group of friends decides to enter an ""extreme"" haunted house that promises to feed on their darkest fears. The beginning of this feels a lot like Channel Zero: No End House, with each of their biggest worries dramatically coming to life.Quickly, the group of young adults learns that some of the monsters inside this house are absolutely real. Either Beck or Woods has a major phobia of stepping on a nail, as that same horrific image from their past film happens twice in this one, along with plenty of other carnage.Lead actress Katie Stevens also starred in the movie Polaroid which was lost in the dissolution of Miramax. She was also an American Idol finalist. Her best friend, Bailey, is also played by a singer, Lauryn McClain of the pop act McClain. The Devil masked character is played by Damian Maffei, who was the leader of the Strangers in the second film in that series, The Strangers: Prey at Night.While I really come down hard on most modern horror, this movie isn't all that bad. There are some nice set pieces and plenty of jump scares. It's not the best film you'll see all year, but it's a cut above the majority of the dreck that studios like Blumhouse are passing off as scary films this year.",Haunt
6,Coventry,The Freaks are off their Leashes!,6,12 April 2020,"In case it was Scott Beck's and Bryan Woods' life-long dream was to make an instant Halloween classic, which people will traditionally watch every year on the 31st of October, they probably failed. However, if their sole intention was to make a fun and engaging scare-flick, they did a fine job! ""Haunt"" is straightforward horror with a very simplistic & derivative plot, but also with a thoroughly creepy atmosphere, effectively spooky monsters/killers and a handful of genuinely tense moments. Bunch of bored kids are looking for excitement on Halloween night and end up in a pop-up haunted house. Naturally, the death traps and boogeymen quickly turn out all too real. The murderous freaks in ""Haunt"" wear uncanny masks, but the definite strongpoint of the film is that they are even more petrifying when their masks are removed. It's never made clear who or what they are, though. Do they form a dysfunctional family? Are they sickos that gathered together in an illegal internet chatroom? A real explanation is never given, but it's not bothersome. The haunted house is a terrific horror location, with narrow tunnels, fake emergency exits and nasty scenery. The acting performances are nothing special, but still decent especially considering the lead teens are quite stereotypical. There's a fair amount of gore, but (sadly?) not too extreme, and the finale has an original ""Home Alone"" twist in store.",Haunt
7,michaelRokeefe,A horrifying haunt,8,17 December 2020,"For those fans of the Saw franchise, you should be pleased with this Halloween screamer. A group of friends are hunting for something darker than the casual 'trick or treat' scare they have outgrown. The friends find an intense maze-based type haunted house that is engaging and not so predictable in getting to the end. Hell, only one survives the twists and turns. Scares, gore and blood bathes proving darkest fears are harmful!Cast includes Katie Stevens, Will Brittain, Justin Marxen,, Caleb Hunt and Lauryn Alisa McClain.",Haunt
8,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable effort with a few minor flaws,9,19 January 2020,"Heading out for Halloween, a group of friends decides to check out a local haunted house nearby, and as they go through the attraction come to believe the masked hosts are trying to kill them which is eventually proven true forcing them to try to get away from the establishment alive.This one was a highly enjoyable effort. Among the film's best qualities is the initial setup and arrival at the main haunt which has a lot to like. The groups' journey to the haunt by being out among friends with their struggles before deciding to leave for the haunted attraction has a realistic bent to it and comes to their arrival in a fun manner just stumbling upon it by chance as a side-of-the-road attraction that feels quite realistic and appropriate. That leads into the general air of the attraction which feels s very much like a genuine local attraction. Filled with cheesy Halloween decor, skeletons are strewn all over and dark lights hiding masked costumers, the maze-like structure and rooms filled with tasks need to perform to move on gives this a fantastic setup and creepy atmosphere. That this gets carried out without them truly knowing if they're out to hurt them but believing they aren't adds some tension to the scenes as well, all making this more suspenseful than it should be. The other big factor here is the strong second half that features plenty of fun with their being stalked and hunted. Once it's obvious that the haunt was not going right and they're in danger, there's some great stalking through the various rooms and corridors in the building, even including the big brawls against them once there's enough weaponry on hand to fight back. Generating some fine brutality and gore on both sides, these are exceptionally fast-paced and fun making for quite a lot to like overall. The film does have some minor flaws. The biggest detriment here is the inability to make sense of how the attraction should work. There's no instructions or directions here as to how they're supposed to operate the event before they turned psychotic and started going after the group. As well, the entire subplot about the abused childhood doesn't need to be included here, merely pointing to a coda that's meaningless and serves no purpose based on what's written here that's barely worth mentioning. These here are the only flaws.Rated Unrated/R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Haunt
9,trashgang,above mediocre haunted house flick due the gore,7,9 June 2020,"How many haunted house horrors do we have already? And how many Halloween flicks do we have so normally I wouldn't watch them all but Eli Roth was behind this one so I guessed that it would contain a bit of gore here and there.Luckily it did and that's what makes this one one to watch. The story itself is just like all of the other ones, things go awry once friends enter a haunted house. But th eexception here is that the creeps in the house are deformed somehow or are weird as they come.I was never afraid, clowns looked okay and some did look creepy but it's the witch inside that was for me the creepiest one.So above mediocre flick due the gore attached,Gore 1,5/5
Nudity 0/5

10,deloudelouvain,Perfect for Halloween if you don't have high expectations.,6,10 December 2019,"Let's face it the horror genre is not the easiest genre to have really good movies. There are a lot of stinkers in this genre, and few masterpieces. Haunt would be btween both, entertaining enough to have a good cinema night, but not scary enough to be remembered. With movies like this one I have more fun watching my wife being scared than with the story itself. The characters are good, a bit evilish, of course they had to put a clown in it as that always works. Overall the acting isn't bad, the plot is what to expect in this genre, the scary moments are a bit slasher like, gore but well done. Worth watching once on Halloween.",Haunt
11,thesar-2,Amateur Night,7,27 October 2020,"You had 364 days to prepare and one job. ONE job!Funny, not sure it it's the pandemic, the movie itself or maybe too many Bud Lights, but I saw this movie almost 5 months ago on June 7, 2020 and I can't remind this hardly at all. I literally remember 2-3 scenes, such as the Ride Share joke and the phones in the box. But 98% of this: no recollection.I did, however keep track of the date (as stated) and how many stars I gave it: 7 out of 10. Odd, for someone not remembering hardly anything, I do agree with my initial assessment of this 500th Haunt-style horror movie. And speaking of which: ""Haunt."" Well, that sums it up.So, Cindy from ""Scary Movie"" and her 5 pals head out on Halloween to a one-review on Yelp Haunt in the middle of Illinois wherever and despite all proceeds going to the Red Cross (ha) it was free to get in. Soon, they realize, the cost is still to high. Too Bloody High.The Makers of the Haunt become the hunters and let's let the bloodbath begin! Will someone please step up and scream You're Next? You'll hope so and be satisfied.I do like the characters, and they felt real. I'm not sure how long I'd last in there because I would never think it was real until the end. And I doubt too many make it too far with that amount of disbelief.There's not much to this story, but it's a fun, gruesome, gory, heart-pounding and recommended time. Just make sure you stick around for the needed third act. I especially liked the climax and how it ended.***Final thoughts: This is how back my memory can be at times: when a friend recommended this, I saw my Excel sheet where I track the movies, dates and stars. I failed to label *which* ""Haunt"" movie I saw, so I watched both trailers to the 2013 version and this, the 2019 one. I STILL could not recall either movie. My friend confirmed this was for the 2019 edition, so I watched this one...again. Kinda nice forgetting, however. All-new experience and I still liked watching it. Both times. Hopefully, I'll forget again and next time, be just as pleasantly surprised.",Haunt
12,Edvis-1997,6,6,17 December 2020,The idea wasn't anything unique at all. Just simple and basic Halloween's movie how something you afraid of can become true. It didn't catch my attention at all. I was waiting whole movie when it's getting more interesting but it never happened. I just don't like the way how it was plain killing scenes without content just boom put rock on head and he's dead. The only thing which wasn't bad in this film - acting. I wouldn't recommend to watch this movie because it's just not interesting and you'll get bored after half or even less.,Haunt

14,ops-52535,do or dare or die,9,13 September 2019,"Finally i found a decent horror thriller, of the claustrophobic, mazerunning type of action, with a good allthough of few words spoken story, with a plot that flows well with the help of a tantalizing kind of score, and solid acting by the young cast. the balance between the scare and the gore are perfectly adjusted, which makes the gutwrenching more tolerable and the fright of the worst horror digestable and sensational.its a halloween flick, a couple of young adults trying to find a good party, but gets lost when driving, till in a remote location a billboard flashing''scare house'', makes them try it out..its a good film with well staged locations and sets, good filmography and sharp editing, and the use of avenge as rerevenge are riveting and extraordinary. if you wanna have a good scarein the ''house of funs'' do dive into this flick as i, the grumpy old man did, with recommendations.",Haunt

19,jtindahouse,Could be 2019's best horror film,10,14 September 2019,"I can't remember the last time I said ""wow"" as many times as I did during 'Haunt'. This movie just never stopped amazing me. Every time it produced something brilliant I'd think to myself how the film had just reached its peak, and then five minutes later it would one up itself with something even better. Imagine this over and over again for 90 minutes and you have yourself an insanely good movie.Very rarely any more do horror films impact me in any way. Mostly I'm just bored by them because either I've seen it all before, can predict what is going to happen next, or simply don't care about any of the characters. More often than not it's all three. In 'Haunt' however I found none of those things. There were countless occurrences I hadn't seen before, I had no idea what was going to happen next, and I literally wanted every character (on the good side of course) to be alright.I had a really uncomfortable feel in my stomach watching this movie and that is what I dream of when I go into a horror movie. That means it works. There was so much to love about this movie. The set-design, the acting, the fact that it didn't rely on false jump-scares or dream sequences, the look of the bad guys (blew my mind), the unpredictability and the non-stop pacing just to name a few. Please see this movie. It is incredible.",Haunt
20,kevin_robbins,"The kill scenes are excellent, well executed, quick and sudden without relying on too much CGI",8,14 May 2021,"I recently rented Haunt (2019) off Amazon Prime for $3.99 after months of feeling ashamed I had not seen it yet. The storyline is around a group of friends looking for a haunted house adventure and they find one. Once the haunted house activities begin they quickly realize everything around them is realer than it appears. This movie is directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who also collaborated on Impulse, Spread and Nightlife. This movie stars Katie Stevens (Polaroid), Will Britain (Kong: Skull Island), Lauryn Alisa McClain (Superstition) and Andrew Lewis Caldwell (iZombie). The storyline itself is very straightforward but the protagonists are very unique and well presented. The kill scenes are excellent, well executed, quick and sudden without relying on too much CGI. This film actually reminded me of a better version of The Houses October Built 2. Overall this was a great modern slasher flick that is a must see for horror film fans. I'd score it a 8/10.",Haunt

Entire film quite slow and full of conversation of Harper talking about her past with Bailey! Bored to freaking death! The killing scene also barely show to us!

27,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting New Slasher with a Solid Premise,9,24 September 2019,"This was a film that I really knew nothing about. A friend online shared in a group that he caught this and was recommending everyone supports this as he really enjoyed it. I saw my theater was playing it so I gave one of the last viewings a shot. Since I knew nothing aside from the title and a vague idea of the premise, I'll do the same here. The synopsis is on Halloween, a group of friends encounter an 'extreme' haunted house that promises to feed on their darkest fears. The night turns deadly as they come to the horrifying realization that some nightmares are real.Right before the film actually starts, we are given glimpses of the extreme haunt being set up. We see a wire threaded around some pipes and we get the opening credits. It then shifts to a pumpkin getting thrown at a door. Bailey (Lauryn Alisa McClain) checks to see what the noise was and watches a truck leaving. It then shifts to Harper (Katie Stevens). She is looking at text messages and we see her putting concealer on over her bruised eye. Bailey knocks and comes into her room, stating what her boyfriend did. Harper displays the typical abusive relationship response that he wouldn't do that. She is then invited out to join Angela (Shazi Raja) and Mallory (Schuyler Helford) for a Halloween party at a bar. She declines at first, but we see her send the text, breaking up with her boyfriend and agreeing to come out. It should also be pointed out that Bailey borrows a ring that belonged to Harper's mother.There we see Bailey go up to a guy, Nathan (Will Brittain). She is excited to see him, but she just leaves while he asks her a question. Following some mix-up, Harper also goes up to him, thinking he was waving her over. The two do end up hitting it off though, until his friend Evan (Andrew Caldwell) hits her with a drink. Harper wants to leave and we see her requesting an Uber to her mother's house. She cancels it and gets a weird text from her boyfriend. She then sees someone in a creepy costume staring at her. Nathan comes out and convinces Harper to stay out. As the group decides what to do, they find a flier for an extreme haunted house and start heading that way.Things take a turn when Harper thinks that Sam (Samuel Hunt), her boyfriend, is following them. She has Evan turn and then pull off to see if her fears are correct. What this does is lead them right to the extreme haunt. They decide to give it a try and meet a creepy Clown (Justin Marxen) at the door. Waivers are given and phones are put into a lockbox. They go in and at first it seems like just a normal haunted house, with some scary and sometimes cheesy things. That is until Mallory disappears and Bailey is hurt. That is when they realize, this nightmare could be more real than they thought and that what is underneath these creepy masks is scarier.Now for that recap, I didn't want to reveal too much of the story, but I thought I needed to fit in a lot of back-story that is pertinent to the story. The big thing here is that I love the setting. I don't go to a lot of haunted houses and I've never been to an extreme one. I think that using this setting is genius. It is somewhere that you are disarmed in the idea that this could all be staged. I like this idea, because murders could start happening without even realizing.This is also a modern slasher that I can get behind. We don't really get a lot of them and good number of those tends to go on the cheaper side. Not to say that this one is has a huge budget, but that really did make it work. It almost feels like taking a combination of slasher with a Saw or The Collector. Not to say we get a bunch of traps, but we do have the idea in here. This does have multiple people that are behind what is happening, so it does break that tradition slasher idea, especially we reveal what they look like.Harper also brings an interesting back-story. She drops early on that she hasn't been home in 4 years and it is revealed why. It makes so much sense why should still be with a guy like Sam despite what he is doing. Personally, I feel for her, but I also know the psychology behind it so it works. This is really her needing to be that 'final girl' where she has to find the strength within her before it is too late.I want to shift next to the pacing and editing. I would say that the latter is used well. The group splits in a two at one point as the maze offers a safe and not safe option. I think it strategically moves between the two. From there, we never really see the group back together as a whole and they even toss in showing us what the villains are doing behind the scenes. I think that works to build tension here. I like that they didn't over-explain it or give us some cope out reason this is happening. The ending I wasn't expecting, but I thought it definitely works for what the film is building.That moves me to the acting of the film. Stevens I thought was a solid lead here. We see that in the beginning she is broken. She doesn't even want to come to this haunted house, but I like that she has to build her broken strength to survive this. She is also quite attractive. Brittain is the solid male lead here. He is the one that is pushing Harper in a good way. Their dynamic I thought was good. McClain, Raja and Helford are all solid as well as attractive. Angela does have a bit of that 'know-it-all' attitude as someone in her family has done it. It was pretty funny. Caldwell brought some laughs as well. I like they didn't go overboard with it and that pretty much stopped when the tension ramped up. Humor is a way of coping with fear and it seems real even though everyone is hiding it. All of the masked people running the haunt are creepy and a lot of that is the masks and them not talking. It gets even more when they take them off. With that said, I think the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.Shifting next to the effects, as I kind of said this does have a bit of feel of those 'torture porn' films. Now I hate this term and this film doesn't fall in that 'movement'. We get some practical effects of things that happen that looked good. There is some CGI, but I will give credit that they give us a glimpse before cutting away. That's knowing how to use it so we can't dissect it by seeing it too much. The look of the killers is really good and quite creepy if I'm honest. I'd also say that the film is shot very well.Now with that said, this one I came in blind to and I'm so glad that I did. I think this has such a great premise of being an extreme haunt on Halloween. The setting is great and making a modern slasher inside of it works. I think there's some good heart and back-story here that makes sense. It has a good running time, builds tension and never gets boring. It has an intriguing ending as well. The acting I thought was fitting for what was needed. I would have liked to see the effects go more practical, but I think they did work. The masks and the killers themselves look good. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it fit for what is needed. With that said, I had a lot of fun with this film and I would venture to say, this could become a staple of my Halloween viewing going forward. I think this is a good movie overall.",Haunt

29,m-47826,It's bad.,2,26 October 2019,"The movie uses all the genre tropes. It has lots of old slasher movies nods in it. No real theme stands out though, only pieces of a couple. With characters that aren't very sympathetic and too cliched to care. Even some twists were taken/borrowed from other slashers. And the gore? Sometimes over the top, but overall PG13. They tried to give a new meaning to the script, but it was done arbitrarily. As if they've decided to drop some aspects of the story midway, and go another direction. That's the most « shocking » thing about this film. How it seemed to indulge in unnecessary sub-plots. Mainly the heroine's back story. But I was still curious to know where it was leading towards. I'm telling you, nowhere. Nowhere unseen or unheard before. The last shot was so survival movie, it was as if it belonged to a different one.",Haunt
30,arungeorge13,"Not much to brag about here, except for the killers' faces! [+48%]",5,8 August 2020,"Poor/inconsistent character sketching is what serves as a major drawback in an otherwise okayish haunted-house slasher. The film, written and directed by Scott Beck & Bryan Woods, serves up a sufficient dosage of slice n' dice, complemented greatly by the killers' creepy faces (a lot scarier than the masks they wear). The special effects work deserves a thumbs up for that. The script, however, needed more punch. Decision-making can be slightly skewed when being pursued by masked killers, but when the downers keep piling up, one can't help but shrug at the laziness displayed in the writing department. It is apparent that Beck & Woods were focusing more on gore and cheap thrills instead. Overall, Haunt is just a not-bad-not-great slasher with a wavering final act and a stupidly twisted ending.",Haunt
31,omendata,A slice and dice above your average horror fair!,7,14 September 2019,"Quick review on this one - its a horror so don't be expecting much in the way of acting talent but hey who cares its a horror movie and we all know the setup by now.I was not expecting much until I saw the name Eli Roth on the credit list so this immediately raised my expectations and I was not disappointed. Rather interesting combo of Saw, Hellfest, Collector II movies among others and very well done for a low budget horror. Eli Roth created two of the most frightening movies of modern times in Hostel & Hostel II which still give me the creeps;especially knowing that it is based on true events that actually are taking place at this very moment in places like Thailand, Mexico,many islamic countries as well as the original red house in Serbia and although many may not like old Eli, he does undeniably have an inkling into what scares us like the great James Wan and this film is no exception.It is not on the level of SAW or Hostel but it has some genuinely creepy moments and plays out rather effectively and I did like the ending.
If you are a fan of the horror genre and are trying to find something decent amongst a lot of the dire celluloid guff that is coming out this year then give this a go - you may just like what you find!!!",Haunt
32,Stephen_A_Abell,Haunt!? It Didn't Haunt Me... Will It Haunt You?,5,21 September 2019,"To be truthful, most of the time this film is a yawnfest. The story has been done before. Quite a few times now... and a lot of them are better than this.The story starts well enough. The teens are bored on this Halloween night (where's Mikey when you need him?) so they decide to go to an extreme haunted house. The trouble is they can't find it. However, while driving down a deserted country road Harper (Katie Stevens) spots they are being followed. In an effort to lose their shadow they take a turn off. This section is the tensest part of the film. Shame it's for nothing as the truck doesn't follow them... it was just a way to get the lost teens to an extreme haunted house, which may or may not be the one they were trying to get to. This scene is one of the better sequences in the film and wasn't even needed - why couldn't they just go to the haunted house? Why did the story need this nonsense? This is when the story started to slip for me.I have to say that the haunted house and its inhabitants aren't too bad. Though more extremity in the scares would not have gone amiss. At the beginning, they have a silent creepy clown - nice. Inside and sans mobile phones they have a cheap plastic skeleton, a witch who supposedly tortures people (though, you never see much), a tacky maze made of pallets, a tunnel to crawl through, and a few holes to push your arms through. There's a couple of sections where spiders are involved but apart from that, there's very little to scare you here. Now don't get me wrong, the directors do an okay job of creating a little atmosphere and tension at some of these points to make you feel a little uneasy. However, should you have been in there, without the spooky music and ambience, then you'd, more than likely, just be bored. The story started to slip a little more. There had been plenty of opportunities to scare the bejesus out of the audience as well as the cast and the writers threw it away.But we can't put it all down to the writers. The actors can share some of the blame for the weakness of scares. Especially the ""holes in the wall"" scene. Here was the perfect moment to show off your well-honed acting talent... okay, maybe not. To be honest, the cast is as average as it can get. The only one who brought some skill to the show was Andrew Caldwell who played Adam.Then we get to the last third of the film and now the crap hits the fan... in a good way. You begin to realise that something isn't quite right about this haunted house. Yep, it may be boring as... hell, but what's happening behind the scenes? Blood, guts, and gore... that's what. The special effects are well decent. I especially loved the hayfork through the head... but not because of the hayfork through the head... but for the eye. Watch the eye of the attacked woman; it's details like this that adds the cherry to the top of the cake.But all of this smacks as ""too little too late"". Some of the viewers may have turned off or switched over to watch Downton Abbey well before now. What the writers and directors, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, should have done was offer this excitement to the audience right from the off; or at least built up the story to this crescendo. Not put us through a dull two-thirds of the film and then dunk us into the mayhem all at once.Then when the reason for the carnage is revealed it's weak and, well, rather silly.Back in the fifties, it was the teenagers who were the evil ones. Dancing lasciviously to raunchy rock and roll and being wild and uncontrollable... with the latent desire to cause chaos and take drugs... In the seventies and eighties, it was the red-necks who could kill you and add you to the cooking pot. In the nineties and the noughties, the corporations were not to be trusted. They'd sell their souls and their families to be rich. For this film though, it's the body dysmorphic and the body modifiers who are evil... and for no other apparent reason but this. Come on guys, what did you do? Just pick a minority group - hey nobody's used these guys before, let's do it.The thing for me is, I know a few people who have had implants and other modifications to their bodies. To me, it's not shocking. It just feels that Beck and Woods chose these just to shock... so for me, it was just a trashy gimmick.In conclusion, I would only recommend this film to horror fans and only if you're all viewed out of the good stuff. You should enjoy the ending section though you'll have to wade through a lot of missed opportunities to get to it. But it's this climax that lifts the film into mediocrity and out of dreadfulness.",Haunt

It's well shot, the makeup effects are nice and for something this basic and stupid, it is overall just really well done.The acting is messy, there are no characters besides some basic cardboard cut-outs, even our main lead is super generic. The writing is bad, but some dialogue is actually unintentionally hilarious (for how bad it is). It is also confusing to see an anti-domestic violence message in a bloody Halloween slasher.After the first couple of scenes I almost gave up on this, but what kept me watching was the look and style of the film. It was just little lacking to be called a guilty pleasure. Just make it gorier and more violent and I'm sold.Overall, not a bad film but nothing besides its looks really stands out.",Haunt

But right after the midway it caught up with disjointed writing and the mediocre performances couldn't help it either! Apart from the technicalities; this film failed on too many aspects. First of all there is a slowness in the screenplay. I understand, horror films naturally takes a bit more time than others to build up the story, characters and all but being a 'Slasher Horror' it needed to be fast paced. Also the dialogues, mediocre to below average characterisations made it further bad. Simply I couldn't care less for any of the characters in the film and that to be honest depicts how bad the writings were on Those characters especially! However makers have successfully delivered on 'Gory details'. Specific fan groups would love those for sure. But on the other hand as there are too many cliches, loopholes barged into it. It never came to that point; where I could say it was a great experience. The promising factor kind of faded away. And towards the end, scene by scene It gotten worse.

Which I personally think hinders the whole plot, because when it ends I'm left with ""what's the point"" attitude.But on the whole it's not too bad.

43,destroyerwod,I love an Halloween slasher movie,7,25 October 2020,"I wanted to see this movie since i heard about it last year, but that happened after Halloween and i wanted to be in the best mood for it, well during Halloween season. Was supose to even keep it for Halloween Night but just couldn't wait any longer.Last year i watched Hellfest wich i absolutely loved, and i kinda wanted this movie to give me a similar feeling, especially when it comes to the Halloween thematic. Ultimately did it do it? Yes and no...The Halloween theme is especially present at the beginning and the pace of the movie is kinda slow at first, but only to let you apreciate the house itself, wich is not a bad thing. I like what they did with it, but kinda wish they even did more. Once the ""slashing"" start, the haunted house kinda take a back seat and it goes more into typical slasher movie stuff but i think its satisfying enough in its genre.The characters often play a huge part on how you enjoy those type of movies, and sadly outside 2 of them, i feel the others were very underdeveloped and i just didn't cared much for them. This may be typical of horror movies but there is also VERY questionable decisions made by the characters at various point that will make you roll your eyes. Stuff a real person would never do.So yes its not a perfect movie by any means, and i can't say i felt in love with it like i did Hellfest, but yet i enjoyed it ! I apreciated the house, the atmosphere, the villains were very decent. Its not original by any means but its competent at its job if i can say.When rating movies i use the Angry Joe scale, with 5/10 being average, and i think this movie is definately more than ""slightly above average"" , i had a good time overall so i think a 7 out of 10 is deserved.",Haunt

Even though I liked it, I wouldn't trust those who say that it's fresh, inovative or is the best haunted house film.""Haunt"" offers us an old concept with minor changes - addition of some cool elements which I won't discuss. A bunch of teens, with a (one way or another) troubled girl as the main character wind up in a hanted house attraction in the middle of nowhere. It's heard of, innit? This is where the better part of the movie starts, directors Beck and Woods manage to entertain us without cheese or unnecessary humor, instead giving us atmospheric enough trip through a what feels like an improvised but effective haunted house. Cool masks, many killers, fun times. With time it gets more gruesome, but also starts to suffer slightly from pacing issues & the characters start doing (or not doing) questionable things/choices/actions. Let's just say that a some amount of general horror movie dumbness can be found in here as well. I found the ending to be a bit underwhelming, it felt like something either more original or more crazy could've been done there.

In this haunted house, people are scared to death by masked people from whom the visitors have to escape, while they have to solve mazes and puzzles in the haunted house.
The friends see how other visitors are brutally dealt with by the masked staff, but when they see how someone is subsequently killed, they start to doubt whether that is still part of the show. When they then lose each other in the mazes and hear how some are caught and killed, they realize they have to get out of this haunted house before it's too late.This film starts a bit slow, but as soon as the friends are in the mysterious haunted house, the pace adjusts and as a viewer you also try to solve the puzzles with the characters or to remember the correct paths through the mazes. This way you are also included in the film as a viewer. When the killings begin, the film turns more into an exciting thriller. Unfortunately, the film is never really scary as well as exciting, because the horror aspects are somewhat predictable or are just simple jump scares. The biggest problem is the hurried, poorly worked out end in which too much has happened to keep following the good. This way, the film appears poorly rounded.The budget of the film was not too large, but they were able to place the film sets in the film in a beautiful and creative way with different spaces for the puzzle rooms and mazes.The cast consists of a group of starting actors, most of whom are still unknown or have acted more in TV series.

63,RhapsodyReviews,Not What I Expected!,8,15 October 2019,"Review:
'Haunt' is an American horror film, written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. I went into this movie expecting your typical jump scare haunted house crap that has been done multiple times before. So, it may be just me going in with low expectations, but this movie is great.
The movie starts out with introducing us to its main cast, which are out on the town on Halloween night looking for something to do. When one finds a poster for an 'extreme' haunted house he enlists everybody to go. Upon entering the house, things seem normal at first, but it soon turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse, and we wonder who will make it out alive.
When it comes to any movie, the most important part to me is the ending, but a close second is the acting and whether we can care about these characters. Everybody in this movie sold you on the fact that they are in danger and it makes you feel uncomfortable from the get-go. Not only do all the actors do a great job at portraying the characters they're playing, but the writers made the characters in this movie smart! The main girl, Harper (Katie Stevens) has a dark past that makes her have some PTSD when some things happen in the house, and she plays it so well.
I love that both the predator and prey in this movie are smart. I don't mean because they're college students, but when they realise, they're in danger, they stop and think about what to do next and take in their surroundings. You don't see that in horror films, ever. Also, the killers in this movie make smart choices, and you can tell that they thought about doing this house for a while and knew how to cover their tracks. The only downside I can think of with this movie, is we never really get a good explanation as to why the killers are doing what their doing. One could just say that they're crazy and like the thrill of it, but the way the movie was, it just felt like it was supposed to be more than that, and I thought it could have been fleshed out more.
Overall, this movie is still a great time to watch in the dark, with good characters and makes a very unoriginal plot and brings new life into it. Also, side note: I can honestly say that I have never seen a horror film where I cared about what happened to the characters until I seen this movie.

64,kyleallencole9,Excellent!!!!,8,15 September 2019,"This movie was extremely awesome and fun. Going to halloween haunted houses are alot of fun, except for the ones where the people running the place are extremely psychotic. This was pretty similar to last years Hellfest, only instead of one masked killer, you get a whole handful of masked psychos who are all into tattoos, facial piercings and facial mutilation. Some of these killers faces were downright disturbing and nasty and slightly deformed. The film also had some great and gory kills in it as well.
So the plot has been used before, a group of college friends seek out a haunted attraction on Halloween and come across a very secluded and unheard of Halloween spook house. You pretty much know they are in trouble since another group went in before them and never made it out and they witness a girl being killed, but believe it's all part of the show. They then become trapped inside and are being hunted down by a group of masked maniacs who have rigged some deadly traps throughout the property. The final girl (Katie Stevens of Polaroid) does a good job at fighting the masked killers to survive while all of her friends are being savagely murdered. The only thing they didnt really explain was who the killers really were.

66,FKDZ,Surprisingly Decent Horror Flick,7,26 October 2021,"Aside from its rough start with some abrupt cuts and time jumps this movie delivers on the horror and thriller front. There's enough gore, but not too much. The thrills are there, the costumes (and particular the make up) is really well done. And the overall story is pretty alright for a horror.The directing and with that the set design is really great. Every area feels unique and it looks great overall. Especially the ghost room was pretty great. The characters felt alright, though none really fleshed out besides Harper. Sam was oddly written (as in his arc) though, it seemed like they had an idea, but later on just quickly scrapped the idea and wrote him out of the whole story.The dynamic between the characters is kind of meh, also the party in the beginning feels fake. There's never really a moment where you can see they are tightknit friends, or care that much about each other. So this does make it hard to really care for the characters.The way they kill them off also varies from meh to pretty good. The gore is minimal, though effective when it needs to be. The razor blade VFX was kind of iffy though.Besides this the badguy(s) don't really have a backstory it seems, or motivation. They're there to kill. I wish we had a little more interaction between the freaks, to understand their dynamic, and it would've made it a lot more interesting. This also goes for their dialog, of which there is pretty much none, I wish they had better/smarter things to say.Like many horror films with a group of friends in distress, stupid decisions are made, and they aren't excluded here. Though the only one that was abhorrently stupid to me was Harper walking towards the shotgun when you could simply craw under it or just duck.There's enough jump scares as well, though predictable.Honestly not a bad little movie to watch during the Halloween season.",Haunt

I don't think it really brings anything new to the table, the characters are all pretty unlikable, even if they attempt to give the main girl a backstory at some point, they're all pretty forgettable.

77,tresm87,"Haunt is the hidden gem horror film of the year with legitimate brutality, tension, and bleak atmosphere throughout that would have been a hit with a major theatrical release.",9,15 September 2019,"8.7/10 When I saw the trailer about a month ago i was pleasantly surprised with its promise shown, and even more surprised and bewildered it wasn't getting a major theatrical release. Having Eli Roth produce, and Beck and Woods directing/writing hot off their momentum from writing A Quiet Place, you would think the studios would have been confident enough and should've because this was higher quality than most big budget horror's released this year.The film starts out in usual fashion and introduces us to what appear to be standard teenage horror characters that were definitely more tolerable than most other characters in other films yet still fit the cliches. As we get a bit more introduced, you can tell that one of them has more emotional depth to her which is an important factor for audience relateability that's overlooked these days in most horror films. When things progress in the plot we are introduced to the main setting in which the mayhem unfolds and for the low budget they were working with, they executed the set designs flawlessly and creatively. The haunted house/maze aesthetic is elevated to new heights of fright through wide arrays of different set pieces, colorizations, and overall foreboding environments. They absolutely knocked it out of the park with the overall visuals and camerawork as well, and it added so much to the already supreme tension. When the antagonists start showing up with their ill intentions, the creepiness and chaos takes hold and never lets up building into a brutal conclusion that honestly will stick with a lot of people with its ultimately disturbing reveals and shocking plot turns.This film really deserved to be released in a major theatrical format and i honestly believe it would have been a hit at the box office. I expected it to be solid but did not expect it to be my favorite horror film of the year. It has so much tension, atmosphere, and an incredibly visceral visual style. It has potential to become an underrated cult classic once word spreads and a definitive haunted house/halloween film. I really hope Beck and Woods stay in the horror genre because they have some clear cut talent in creating tense atmosphere that oozes through the screen.",Haunt
78,WisdomsHammer,Sadistic slasher movie,3,6 October 2021,"3/10 is a harsh rating for me to give but let me explain why and why you might want to ignore it and go ahead and watch this if it's your thing.Kids go into a haunted house that turns out to be real. This isn't new, but it's also a fun premise to revisit if done well - and this one is done pretty well. Unfortunately, I don't think there's enough torture porn for the sickos looking for it and for anyone else who didn't realize that they were going to be watching anything other than high schoolers being stalked, tortured, and killed in a death maze is going to be disgusted. It's too simple. It's a movie meant to disgust you and gross you out. That's fine. Some people will like that. It's not really my thing, but I liked the way they did the villains in this so I watched it. And it was okay for what it was, but there wasn't anything else to it, really.My biggest problem is with poorly written protagonists who suck at surviving. It's cliche. I get it, that's what some of these movie are all about - just being a meatgrinder. But even the ""smart"" one here never makes sure anyone is dead and just sits there and stares at her impending doom most of the time. It's annoying. Well, to me anyway.This will be much better than a 3/10 for people who want to watch this sort of thing. It's just not my bag.",Haunt

It's got some great ideas for a haunted attraction as well as a movie. It takes some cliches and uses them, and takes other cliches, and twists them. It IS however slightly annoying how well-planned the antagonists are, and how well they're able to predict the main characters' decisions. And yes, there are the standard Cabin-in-the-Woods type characters, and yes they make dumb decisions, and yes they do not make decisions like a normal person would, but who would under such circumstances?It's a great horror movie, despite its flaws. And yes, I personally wish it was more graphic and bloody, because let's be honest, it was really tame for anything that has to do with Eli Roth. But it's still a wild, worthy ride. Modern horror is not all bad, and here's the proof.EDIT: I've watched it for the third time now, it keeps getting better and better. THIS. IS. A. GEM!!!!! Do NOT pass this one up!

86,A_Llama_Drama,Exceptionally creepy haunted house fare,9,28 September 2019,"The writers of ""A Quiet Place"" are back, this time with the blessing of torture porn artiste ""Eli Roth."" unlike their previous outing, they arent trying to reinvent any wheels, or push any boundaries. All theyre interested in doing is scaring the hell out of their audience. For the most part, they succeed.Harper and Bailey are roommates and friends. Harper is nursing a fresh bruise from her abusive boyfriend, so Bailey persuades her to avoid him, and join her for a Halloween night out. The friends all gather at a club but, soon enough, one obnoxious guy has decided it's lame and time to hit a haunted house up. You'd think young adults would know by now that when a silent clown requests your handheld device, something is not right (in their defense, they do sign disclaimers first: scam artists truly are upping their games everywhere). Soon enough, a descent into madness and torture begins as the group is stalked by a witch, Satan a ghost and a madman with a chainsaw.""Haunt"" succeeds in the beginning and up until the final bloodletting, it doesn't let up. The biggest thrill here is the writers' ability to test your nerves, with moments of ambiguity, dangling hope at all times that none of this is Actually real. As the group move from situation to situation, with all sorts of horror scenarios playing out like the best sort of candy haul after a night of guising, you are right there with them as they panic, reassure themselves and try to outwit the monsters they may be trapped with.The film, unfortunately, loses momentum as it switches gears in the final reel but for the first two thirds, it manages to unsettle in a way Tobe Hooper or Rob Zombie would be proud of. The villains are all startling in their own rights, masked and unmasked, and their little traps and tricks are simultaneously horrific, dastardly and fun to watch. A subplot about domestic abuse and the wicked web it weaves is never developed far enough for the pay off, coming across more as a deus ex machina than a true character exploration. However, by splitting up the two heroines Early on, and giving equal time to both during the early stages, it's never certain just who the ""final"" girl will be, creating a source of tension whenever either finds themselves in peril.After a few years of directors taking horror, and themselves, too seriously, it's so nice to just see a horrific haunted house flick in the style of Hooper, Zombie or Wingard.

There were some ""eye-rolling"" moments, but the scares were more potent than the plot shortcomings and the fast-paced plot kept me engaged.This movie was a pleasant surprise in a genre that has been done ad nauseam and I dont regret watching it.

The film is a simple extreme haunted house plot. The acting was very good for actors that are just coming into the industry. The humor was surprisingly high with lots of laugh out loud moments. The makeup and props department killed it. Very creepy. I didn't jump during the movie but it was solid. The action was cool. Not too long and not too short of a run time.

Its quite dark and the antagonists are convincingly nasty, and with a bit more depth than your usual movie bad-guys. The main actors arent too bad and the score is good too.

Then they did it again and again reading backwards words through a mirror.Oh someone is chasing me into a room with a puzzle for a lock to get out and you think hiding under the only place big enough for you is the thing to do? Let's not forget that these crazies have done traps so lets put our face right in front of a jack in the box and rotate the handle. Or how about the shotgun that shoots every time the jack in the box goes off. Let's stand up right in it's way and try and run to it before it goes off again.

Never have I seen characters written to be so absent minded and at a total loss of common sense. If this is how you have to make characters in order for a story to be ""scary"" or make it last longer, I rather not watch them anymore.It's really unfortunate too, it has good suspense, acting, and camera work. All that is tarnished by how completely stupid the group of friends are. I mean a total absence of spatial and situational awareness. It completely took me out of the film and made me not feel bad about the characters at all. Truly makes you think about natural selection at its finest.Everything in the last say, 15-20min of the film completely ruin the rest of the movie. So stupid and cringey. It's all thrown in your face instantly and goes quick without explaining. Just happens and credits.If you can get past the insult to your intelligence of seeing these as believable characters, all the typical final girl cliches, and predictability...you'll enjoy the film.

Wolves I just feel like for that specific pocket of the genre is really one of best werewolf movies I've ever seen-past or present. But I also saw trick & haunt & tho I put them in just under the former 2, they still both were really good.If you saw talon falls & thought it was ok, then you would def think this was really good. If u haven't seen talon falls, this is close enough to it & I'd suggest watching this instead. Even tho I watched both cuz I'm a horror fan & love to see em all once. The film title is kinda self explanatory in terms of giving an idea what the movie is about.If u see any reviews under 5 ignore them please. As long as u like horror movies than u will laugh at the idea that someone could give this movie any lower. We all have opinions and they vary, so maybe you'll think this was a 6, 8 or 9, or maybe even a 7 like me. But I will not accept anything lower than that as being a serious unbiased assessment but instead something from some religious fanatic flooding the review boards or some Uber PC renegade, or maybe just a troll or hater of horror movies.The acting was fine if. By that I mean it 💯 be wasnt bad. I can tell bad acting pretty easily would think we all can. If we watch a movie & acting is bad, its kinda hard to believe in characters. It's almost like you're watching regular people try to act. But when the acting is at least ok if not better, you don't even think about it. Your able to get lost in the film & just focus on the story without being sidetracked. That's all I ask for, I don't need Oscar worthy performances all over the screen.

From the moment the movie started and towards the end,it kept me in a huge suspense and it really gave me some amazing jump scares,not to mention that even though the plot might be similar to other horror movies just wait and see the end and it will change your mind.
By the way,when I saw those psychos dressed in clowns I was expected some regular dudes and what I got was way better.
Another great thing about this film are the bloody/gore scenes that are a lot in the movie and are pretty similar to the ones from the horror movies like Friday the 13th,Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Purge and A Nightmare on Elm Street.
As for the cast,all the actors from the cast are perfect and sometimes the characters who were hunted by the clowns made me feel like I'm right with them or I'm seeing the horror things happening to them or their friends from their eyes.
Honestly,I don't know if the team behind this movie will think of making a sequel with other teenages but if they'll do,than I'm 100% sure that it will at least be as great as this one.

If I was watching this in a theatre, I would have given a standing ovation. In fact, I naturally applauded during the end credits alone at home lolThe people who didn't give this movie many stars seem to complain about the characters' dumb choices which are mainly about not keeping the weapons with them all the time. I can relate to them, but I have to say the characters in this movie are a lot more decent than the typical youth in similar movies.
There is no sl*t, childish Neanderthal, or good girl with a handsome jock boyfriend. There are four girls, but none of them are even wearing a sexy costume despite the fact that it's Halloween night. One of them are wearing a scrub as a nurse costume. See? These people are sensible. However, I have to admit there are moments that the characters could keep an iron bar, razors, a big gardening fork and a gun to fight back, and they do use some of those tools though they toss those weapons after each use. Yes, that's a stupid move, but I also understand that it's difficult to carry around in the maze depending on the kind of tools. I don't expect characters in horrors to calculate the worst scenario and act accordingly all the time for the storyline's sake. That's why when characters occasionally exercise very good judgement, it makes the movie stand out. I believe the more clever it is, the more satisfying and memorable experience the film provides to us.I actually think it's a compliment that quite a bit of viewers felt frustrated with the characters' move. People expect more from them because they feel like these characters can do better. If this was a typical horror which are full of dumb characters with dumb decisions, you wouldn't really care, you would consider leaving weapons behind is just a stereotypical move, we have to go with it. Nonetheless, because characters in this movie are fairly reasonable, some horror fans wanted more I assume.To me, if the characters outsmart killers, that's a great bonus, deserves one more star. That's why I really love ""YOU'RE NEXT"". Some may differ here, but I felt the similar vibe from this film, especially in the last scene. If the ending goes like that one of the killers follows to the hospital and the final girl sees him and screams, I would've given 4 or 5 stars. That's such a hackneyed ending. I love seeing a character doesn't succumb his/her trauma and face it and beat it in the end.Someone complained that there's no explanation of why those clowns look like 'that' and kill random people. You don't get all the answers in horror movies, there are screwed up people out there and these kids happen to be lured into their webs PERIOD. I agree there are movies which owes explanations and answers to us due to lack of weak scenario, but I don't think that's the case in this movie. Some horror films are like a roller coaster, meant to be enjoyed without overthinking. You just enjoy the thrill and the excitement and I think those elements which were successfully delivered in this movie compensate for its minor flaws.I am very grateful that I stumbled upon this great horror flick. Now there is a problem. How can I find a movie to top this?",Haunt

It copies so many horror movies that I was left utterly bewildered. To top it all off, not one time did I become scared, which obviously is what horrors are meant to do. Get us scared.

A group of students decide to visit a haunted house. The fun derails once it becomes obvious that this far from a tame joyride. The Setup seems a bit cheesy, but fun and campy. The characters bring a personality, even If they arent deep and interesting, they at least keep you on board.
For me the tension fell completely flat after the first death, at that point I knew where it was going and thus it lost me. Horror doesnt work If you know whats going to happen and the Story itself wasnt creative enough to keep my Attention gripped. Illogical decisions and a unclear motivation from villains and weird reactions from Protagonist kept me further disconnected from what was going on. At that point it still could have been a fun slasher movie, which would fit the Halloween theme well, If it we're successfull at being that. But the kills arent interesting either, they seem uninspired, just like the villains, the effects of the gore are well executed, but arent big enough to satisfy any gore fans either.In short, the movie doesnt completely fail in any part, but cant succeed either. It ends up as the worst kind of Horror: a boring one. And dont get me started on that unsatisfying end...",Haunt

Not only that, they chose to trust one of the killers to assist in their escape.

The film lacks themes so there is no redeeming factor in the end. Some plot points do not connect and some things are not explained well.Overall: The movie should not be bad.

It lacked the ""moral"" aspect of the Saw-movies, but other than that... So I believe that if you liked the aforementioned series of movies, you will probably like this movie.

135,yogsottoth,So so bad,3,4 April 2020,"The idea is good. A Halloween themed Jigsaw movie. How hard can it be to make it fun and scary? All you have to do is think of some cool rooms and smart puzzles, slowly make the characters understand it's not make believe. No, that was too much to ask apparently.1- This must be the dumbest group of bad guys ever. Why are they all improvising? Why does no one have a plan? Why did that one guy suddenly decided to fully commit to pretending to help them in the middle of his show, give them his keys and everything? They could have killed him right there since they had already witnessed a friend's murder, a broken hand and a cut arm. No you can't convince me it's acting when someone just broke my hand dude. Why did that one guy fry 3 phones and left the rest? What was the point of cutting that rope in the knife room as if the whole room is gonna come down when it only brings down a pathetic door? It would have to coincide with the girl going under it so what's everyone's hurry? And why are they never talking to each other instead of attacking them one by one. Of course you're all dead, I'm surprised you've come this far running such a messy operation.2- The bad guys are not the only dumb ones of course. The group finds not one, not two, not three, not four, by my count 5 or 6 weapons and discard each one after a single use. One weapon entrusted to the fat guy completely disappears. Why would you go through the tunnel first and sprint off like a maniac if you're not gonna wait for that creepy guy in a mask that none of you trust? It's so simple, two people first, they wait by the end of the tunnel, than the creepy guy, than the last two people. Why the hell would you leave him alone to do whatever he likes? And turn your back to him after he finds you, just by himself? The guy has a hammer in his hand, your friend was murdered in front of you while two others were attacked. What do you mean?! Just think what you would do in that situation, it's not that hard. It shouldn't be this off base. That one girl acting like she lost her arm because of a couple cuts and having to be carried along the way was also super annoying. And what was the main girl thinking walking towards the rifle hoping for the best when all she needs to do is step to the side?! Three people on each side could avoid getting shot at if they just turned sideways and walked along the wall. Sooo dumb!!3- This. This made me wanna write a review in the first place. What terrible idea demon possessed you to make that weird cut and not show the hammer guy's face reveal and fatso's death? That would have been the one saving grace for this movie because that was some nice makeup. Really creepy. How and why would you completely skip the suspense and fear that reveal and attack would give you on a silver platter? How has Eli Roth okayed this?Terrible, terrible, terrible movie. Absolute trash. Just do better. It's not that hard. It shouldn't be that hard to not make such a dumb flick.",Haunt

Another thing that I really enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't hold back the gore like some lower budget indipendent movies do due to budgetary constraints. The setting of the movie made you feel like you were really there with them in this extreme and claustrophobic haunted house.

For what it is, for what it tries to do, it's honestly near perfect.It was an all around well paced and incredibly fun watch. it is ""get up and go"" almost right from the start, with just enough setup, and minimal character development, but honestly it worked. Great timing on the ""relief"" moments. A few moments you can have a laugh and yell at your screen ""why are you doing that!?"". Good antagonists. Good ending. It didn't take itself too seriously, but at the same time struck me as darker than a lot of recently watched in the genre. if your biggest complaint is ""dumb"" characters, just take a walk out of my genre.
This is what I like to call ""rollercoaster/haunted house/Funhouse"" horror. Yes the movie is pretty much built and in motion from ""stupid"" characters, if they weren't stupid there would be no movie. For a Funhouse horror it was damn near perfect.",Haunt

No backstory, no deeper meaning, no satisfaction for the viewer.The kills are ok and not too torture porny, but a little too on the nose given this is a ""random"" group of teens. How would they know one is petrified by spiders and happen to tip a bucket of them on her in particular? Good question, no answers here though.The final girl may as well have had ""final girl"" tattooed on her forehead - she has suitable boast traumatic history that makes her the perfect patsy.There is no final ""a-ha"" moment, and the whole premise would instantly fall apart if someone had a cell phone or a firearm.I wish the writers and producers would put more effort in, the production value was ok and the actors were ok too given the lack of material they had to work with.Spend another week writing and make the story better would be my advice, you can only suspend disbelief so far...",Haunt

The basic story is cruel, simple, and works out to the end. In a modest way the movie would be worth to be called better. Still it is only better among the worst mainstream horror dished these days.One failure is that Haunt gives the audience zero explanations, why demons, or psycho-killer ghosts, exist. Another is we have no knowledge, nor any vague estimation, of what powers they have, or why they can connect to childhood traumatic experiences of young adults.At the end Harper is a tough lady fighting back, but at the price of having her boyfriend, her only friends, and her civilized life taken away from her.If you just want to see some young adults get trapped, tormented, and killed, then this is OK. If you hoped that it makes sense, deserves a sequel, and actually aims to entertain the audience, then it is not among the best.Promising, if it was a starter work, but in an age, where research is just one WIKI away, one could avoid a minimalism of background definition & storytelling.Plus: Them bad guys murdered hot chics!

Putting a group of college student stereotypes through an ""extreme"" house of death traps run by an insane clown posse (sorry) with little insight as to either group's motivations or background is necessarily going to be, uh, haunted by classic horror movie tropes. Haunt manages to pull this off, but only barely. Naturally, it needs a heavy dose of suspension of disbelief, as well.Ultimately, cliches are still cliches even if it is done deliberately and even if the plot manages to subvert some tropes and to conjure some creepy enough imagery. It's certainly far from being completely boring, which is a sin many pictures of this sort are guilty of. However, I would have rated it better if it were more subtle instead of dishing out jump scares by the dozen. Also, putting the protagonists into the house of horrors right off the bat without much of a setup or backstiry is a formula that works here, so I have no idea why they suddenly decided to bring up the main character's wholly unnecessary backstory later on and make callbacks to it.",Haunt

Maybe John Krasinski had the hand in the amazing characters in A Quiet Place. Who knows.Do not go into this film expecting much. It's a fun movie to watch during quarantine or with your partner.

I guess people these days have peer pressure, didn't we had enough in high school? Put attention when you are watching a show and they have a special guest and that guest says a bad word, how everyone in the audience starts laughing.",Haunt
161,whineycracker2000,"The return to ""Fun"" Horror",7,19 September 2019,"I found myself enjoying Haunt way more than I thought I would. The art and set design are excellent without being over-the-top. The special effects (mostly practical) are impressive, and the murder set pieces are genuinely unnerving at times. The sound design, lighting, and production value are all top-notch. It also benefits from a great score by the always-fabulous Tomandandy.As the film opens, we meet college student Harper (Katie Stevens), who is trying to steer clear of her menacing, alcoholic ex-boyfriend who she fears is stalking her. To take her mind off things, her friends drag her out on the town for a night of Halloween merriment. Before long, a haunted house attraction with a very low turnout appears seemingly out of thin air and the kids do what any kids in a horror film would do and head straight to the ticket booth. Instead of a box office attendant, they are greeted by a creepy mute clown who seems harmless enough, if a little off-who escorts them in......and you can predict more-or-less what happens next, at least in terms of the story's general outline.If this sounds all-too-familiar, you may be pleasantly surprised at how the film elevates its worn premise and makes it feel fresh. And it does so without ever being a carbon copy of its influences, even if it wears them proudly on its sleeves. The first 30 minutes or so, in particular, is gleefully unrelenting in its creepy build-up. The tension is steady and measured, similar to the style of the best of the old-school slashers. It relies on the always-effective Hitchcockian less-is-more over-gore approach, although the film is certainly not lacking in the latter department. The characters are more likable and relatable than those you find in similar, recent genre offerings and their reactions to all the horrific happenings are relatively realistic and logical, too.Unfortunately, but not fatally, the movie loses a little steam for a bit before it abruptly shifts from the escalating creepiness of the first act to all-out visceral horror in the second. I also am not sure that the film needed Harper's oral backstory about growing up in her own ""haunted house,"" as the film comes to a complete halt for this diversion. At the same time, it did give her character some plausible motivation for a particular moment when she overcomes meeting a deadly fate in a ""saw""-like set-piece.Pet peeve aside, I highly recommend Haunt, at least to fans of old-school A-list slashers. While the film could have used another 15-20 minutes of employing the same suspense and atmosphere from its earlier scenes before getting into the real carnage and gore, it still delivers a lot of quality thrills and chills and has little filler. Its makers put a lot of energy into it and demonstrate a strong affection for the films it recalls. And it contains one genuinely catch-you-off guard ""Gotcha!"" moment that I didn't see coming and made me jump out of my seat (and this is coming from someone who never falls for the jump scare).",Haunt

How is it that the lame character in the movie ends up being the heroine? Did the actors lose their ability to act? Why don't directors expect more these days? Dead eyes, lame lip quivering and staring into the darkness are a waste of a good script, not to mention the lack of screaming in a slasher flick!!! All I see are entitled, rude brats on the screen who deserve what they got! There was no story, just very bad and laughable acting. I skipped 90% of the movie because it was that bad and predictable.

173,Dar_Sargent,"Overrated, lazy movie",2,17 August 2020,"This movie would've been OK as a short film instead of a half-baked 90 minutes. The gimmick of a sinister, carnival-style haunted house run by actual killers is great for 15 minutes. But too many people give this film high praise just because of that premise, when the overall movie fails on so many basic levels. A gimmick does not make a movie.And this film even fails at its own gimmick. The villains are a cultish group with no motive except playing cat-and-mouse with their victims. In a slasher film, that's plenty! But this movie can't even hold up that simple promise. Instead, the villains are all moronic thugs who just like to kill. They're totally happy just stabbing or clobbering their victims like a goon, so why did they waste time building this huge, incredibly elaborate house of deathtraps?It leaves you feeling cheated. Imagine a Saw movie where Jigsaw builds a bunch of twisted games for his victims... but instead of using the games, he just stabs everyone for no reason. This of course ruins any chance of being scary, and it's all the worse because the setup had such obvious promise.A lot of horror movies get weak in the third act, but this is a movie that straightup stops caring, and it takes the hastiest path to the ending. In the third act, a bunch of characters quickly die in really lame and stupid ways, and then the movie basically shrugs and says ""yeah, it's over. That's all we got."" Then there's a cliche final scene where one killer returns (in full costume, in the middle of town, in broad daylight like an idiot) just so he can die and the main girl can say a stupid quip. Roll credits.It's like they forgot to write a climax. Or they wrote the movie for stoners who would be too baked to notice. The entire last third of the film isn't even average or OK; they simply didn't try. It's really, really disappointing.For example: Mitch the Ghost has the most personality and screentime of the villains, and he's basically the most memorable character in the movie. In one scene, the main girl bonks him in the head once and runs away... and apparently that killed him, because he never comes back. It's not anticlimactic in a clever way, it's just the filmmakers losing interest in everything they'd built up. It's a major screw-you to the viewers: ""you took the time to watch our movie, but you don't deserve a payoff!""Oh and also, the main girl had an abusive dad, and now she learns to stand up for herself because she runs into these slasher villains. That's not deep, people. That's a cliche.In the end, Haunt works if you just want something to play in the background of your Halloween party.

They pick up some guys and drive around, wondering what to do next. They encounter a quaint haunted house attraction deep in the woods and decide that this should be how they spend their Halloween night. Since this this is a horror film, you can already guess that the performers inside might have more sinister and deadly motives than just supplying a good scare or two.Haunt is a fairly simplistic movie, but the performances are mostly above average for a film of this sort and it's refreshing to see horror film characters do the right thing on multiple occasions. I can't say it's a tremendous, original take on the slasher genre, but it gets the job done and supplies a few jolts here and there.The effects work is great and, when the villains' masks come off, it's a pretty horrifying sight. I do wish that, perhaps, there was a bit more backstory about this haunted house and the performers who inhabit it. How long has this been up? Have they done this in other locations?

There is still some work to be done for choosing less cliche types.
If you've ever been to a Haunt you'll recognize the awkward tension of trying to interact with the Haunt actors (it never works) and the tension only builds from that.

The people at the house could have a deeper purpose for being there, yet, again they don't - they're just a means to an end so the story can exist without needing to actually delve into a story.The acting was quite good, it's a horror movie where you might actually find yourself not hating the characters and judging them on their blatantly stupid decisions (though all of the opportunities are there) & if you're after a bit of gore factor which you find in many of Eli's projects then this should be fine to satisfy your expectations.

I was not expecting much from Roth after ""The Green Inferno"" and ""Knock Knock"" were both fairly disappointing to me. The writers of this movie were the same ones who wrote ""a Quiet Place"" which I wasn't actually too big of a fan of. There was definitely a good amount to gore, but not too much to the point where it was disgusting and hard to watch.

No. But it is a good popcorn horror flick that will keep you entertained throughout with more then one nasty kill that will have you cheering out loud.",Haunt

Let me set you straight, this is a typical college kid slasher movie. Nothing new, nothing inventive, no clever writing, everything is rehashed from every cheap haunted house/slasher movie that preceded it. I found myself bored to death and unable to connect with any of the characters or the movie itself. In fact, I would have felt less cheated if they ended the movie at the 30 minute mark by simply throwing all these kids into a giant blender and killed them off at once. BTW, the backstory the girl added absolutely nothing to this movie. I find it hard to believe that the positive reviewers are all connected with the movie, but I cannot think of any other explanation. ""The best horror movie of 2019"" - really? ""Every time they did something that made me say 'wow' they did something else to top it"" - NOT even close. This movie was boring, predictable, and slow!!!To be totally truthful, it should rate about two or three stars, but since it was obviously so heavily biased by what I see at false positive reviews, I'm giving it one star. If you spend $5.99 to rent this thing, then you will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and wait until it is free on Netflix and you have 90-minutes to kill sometime.",Haunt

He hardly manages to make a small hole in the wall when he is attacked by a villain. His luck was that the character in the house managed to make the hole in the wall bigger and come out to help him.

254,PyreworksShow,A bit mixed with more good than bad,8,2 August 2020,"Haven't written a review in a while. My brother and I decided to sit down and watch this just this evening since we'd just gotten Shudder and had both gone on a bit of a spree adding to our combined watch list (we have very similar tastes in horror). I added this one because of how much I adore the first Houses that October Built film and this shares quite a few similarities. This, however, is not found footage, and has a far less ambiguous ending. It centers around a half dozen friends who get bored on Halloween night and leave a noisy club looking for some excitement. While attempting to ditch somebody following them (whom the main character suspects is her abusive boyfriend) they end up in a pretty shoddy looking extreme haunted house. At first it appears to be a series of cheaply built sets housing a few surprising and effective scares, but very quickly devolves into a fight for survival. The premise is pretty basic as horror movies go, but the movie does a good job not overplaying its hand so you're caught off guard as often as the characters. The group of villains is written very smartly and are absolutely fascinating as horror movies go, especially as there's a very subtle implication of cult ideals driving them, and their visual designs end up going from simple and effective to incredibly memorable. The over arching story contains a rather Scream-like take on character progression, but, as I stated, it doesn't overburden it with unnecessary backstory or too much personal drama. The one real knock against it is that the characters do occasionally suffer from that classic horror movie trope of anti-logic, but it's pretty infrequent and all the actors do such a solid job (particularly after they leave the club) that the moments are pretty easy to overlook. This makes me excited to look into Shudder's other original properties, and is an easy recommendation to my fellow horror fans.",Haunt

Let me tell you what happens, the teens go into a haunted house, they all get killed except two who are obviously into each other and end up dating and surviving in the end, such a predictable typical old school overused plot here. There wasn't any suspense or creepiness or gore or anything! It was just a complete mindless stupid snooze fest!

However, somewhere just after the nightclub scene this film slowly began to take off. It was creepy, pretty well written and even unpredictable. It took a few strange turns which I wasn't expecting, some of them I thought might have ended up ruining the movie (I was praying they wouldn't) but they turned out well and added to the storyline in a good manner. Some of the lines were still a little bit cheesy but there was nothing that really made me think the dialogue was bad and the acting was more than adequate.

That dumb moment comes in the third act, when the main characters are unarmed and being hunted by some dangerous creepy bad guys. In one scene, the main character is trying to release a shotgun from a mechanical contraption. I thought, ""That's very smart trying to do that."" But, sadly, she is unable to get to free of the device, and has to run. that is absolutely forgivable. Also, I should mention, even with it fixed in that contraption, she managed to use it to kill two bad guys. Nice! Right? Then, she and another character manage to catch and severely injure a freak who has a handgun. In fact, they practically amputate the arm holding the gun. I was like, ""There you go, kiddo! That one is NOT locked in place. Grab it!"" But, no. She doesn't. Instead, she and the guy grab each other's hands and run away, leaving that nearly fully loaded pistol behind. Well...I stopped caring about the movie right there. I didn't care anymore if they lived or died. The inconsistency of the character broke the fourth wall, the veil was lifted and I was reminded I was just watching a low budget horror film.

NEVER KNEW what was going to happen, jumped consistently because you really DON'T KNOW when or what's coming. Definitely couldn't have guessed the end and yet I'm amazing at figuring those sort of things out. Only one complaint, there is one major factor that I never really got or at least didn't understand what something was about. I don't even want to hint at it because I'm not gonna give anything away that might spoil it on accident.

Even after the semi-positive reviews I was hesistant. I still gave it a shot, because I had nothing interesting to do and thought MAYBE this is the one surprising horror movie of the year. And is it?No, it's not.
From the opening alone I knew what kind of movie I was getting into. A movie that would get very boring because of it's predictability and even though the runtime is around 90 minutes, the movie felt 2 hours long.The actors did a fine job. None of them were bad. The only problem is that, I didn't care about any of them. One of the girls is given a back story, GREAT! But what about the others?
At one point in the movie 'Harper' is talking about her past. Good. And now what is the story of the other girl? Oh, she doesn't have one because she will will be killed later on. So, who cares? She's not the main character.Here is where the biggest problem lies for me.
The movie is sooo predictable, and it takes away ALL the tension. Some scenes were very claustrophobic and tensed, like the scene with the coffin. But then the movie chooses to do something Horrory and it takes away all the interest. So, even the smallest moments get ruined by stupid writing choices.I would not recommend this movie. I felt like it was a waste of time, because there so many better horror movies out there that you can go and watch.",Haunt

I was actually surprised when this one kept me glued to see what happens and most of the acting was good. The generic title makes you think it will be just another one of ""those"" horror movies, but it isn't (because it's good). Some very creative scenarios/scenes that were almost nail-biting. The very end was a little out of place, but up to that it keeps throwing the unexpected at you, and the ""monsters"" were eerily unsettling (as they should be).",Haunt

I'm of the belief that things are often better suggested, less is more. As such I'm not really a fan of movies which have had the involvement of Eli Roth, who produced this film.Haunt does feature a few stomach turning moments of ultra violence but thankfully not too many with the focus being more on atmosphere, tension and suspense. The set-pieces in the 'Haunted house' are gleefully disturbing as well as quite ingenious along with freakish masks kind of resembling a new look and somewhat more trippy Slipknot (metal band).I was surprised to read some reviews criticising certain decisions by the characters at various points in the film and feel that's just nit-picking. In almost every horror movie I watch I end up questioning a character's (often dumb!) actions! In Haunt I found the characters to be relatively well developed (for this kind of movie), the film also surprised me with several twists it took and the unnerving mood throughout with some sleek editing too adding to this.It's ot a masterpiece for me as I doubt I'd really seek it out to watch again but it's a decent and menacing horror thriller. If you're in the mood to watch something vaguely along the lines of 'Hell Fest' but with an extra helping of weirdness then this is worth a shot.",Haunt

I don't know why the primary protagonist makes so many silly decisions in the latter half of the movie, and I am NOT the type of person who goes through horror films pointing out stupid character choices (I love b-horror and most of all I know that bad decisions need to come about to make a slasher film truly work, especially when homage is to be paid/expected) but this movie is truly an outlier and truly stands out because I did not expect it to go this way, lmao.
Seriously, watch the film and you'll realize how silly, cheesy and absolutely brainless the cast (and overall film logic) becomes--and this is NOT in the good way.Still really love this movie though, and I would recommend watching it. Amazing gore effects, very unique takes on classic elements of horror (especially at first) and an initially (and somewhat overall) intriguing plot save this movie from its dismal, cringeworthy second leg....
