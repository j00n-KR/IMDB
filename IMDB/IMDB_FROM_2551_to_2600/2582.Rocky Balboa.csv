0,Leofwine_draca,A good combination of strong writing and overwhelming passion,7,3 November 2016,"And so here we have it, to date the final entry in the long-running ROCKY series. It's hard to believe that a 30-year gap has passed between the first film and this one, and you might be forgiven for thinking the films would have run out of steam long before now. Not so. Like Rocky himself, this film is a winner and one of those movies that keeps on giving.Of course, filming styles have changed, so this is the film that feels most up to date of the lot. Stallone employs new camera techniques, especially in the final boxing match which is almost overloaded with stylish inserts, black and white segments and effects to make it feel realistic. Before then, though, we have an engaging and warming human story in which Stallone himself is centre screen throughout. That Rocky is just as likable as he was in the first film is testament to the actor's abilities.I was disappointed when I learnt that Talia Shire wouldn't be returning for this film, because Adrian has always been a big part of Rocky's life. I needn't have worried. Although the actress is absent, Adrian is present pretty much consistently throughout the movie. It's great to have Paulie back, too, and Geraldine Hughes is an actress who acquits herself well with a sweet could-be love interest.I enjoyed having Rocky running a restaurant in his retirement, and I liked all the links with other films in the saga. I found the way that he gets back into the boxing world to be realistic and believable, and the training sequences are a heartening throwback to the earlier films in this series. There's nothing not to like here, just strong writing and overwhelming passion. I loved it.",Rocky Balboa
1,SnoopyStyle,love the nostalgia,8,6 September 2015,"Boxing is falling into disrepute. The champ Mason Dixon can't find a good opponent. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is back living in the old neighborhood. Adrian is pass. His son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) is busy at work and struggling to live in his shadow. He befriends Marie from the neighborhood who smart-mouthed him in the first movie. His avatar wins a virtual fight on ESPN with Mason Dixon. Paulie (Burt Young) gets laid off from the meat packer. Dixon's manager arranges a fight between the champ and Rocky.I love recalling all the stuff from the original. I like Rocky going back to the old neighborhood. I like that he's the underdog again. However it's too much of an underdog. He's in the best shape of anybody at his age but he's not convincing as a viable opponent. Conveniently breaking his hand in the first round helps the believability but it's also very convenient. If this is the last time Rocky is in the ring, it's a good way to finish his time.",Rocky Balboa
2,claudio_carvalho,The Last Thing to Age in Somebody Is Their Heart,7,23 April 2008,"In Philadelphia, the retired former champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) misses his beloved deceased wife Adrian; tries to get closer to his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) and has a routine life helping people, running his restaurant telling his past glories to clients and taking pictures with his fans. When the television shows a virtual fight between Rocky and the unappreciated undefeated heavyweight titleholder Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) wined by Rocky, he feels the need to return to the ring to practice boxing in little fights as a sport. However, Mason's managers see the chance to promote their non-charismatic champion in a fight in Las Vagas in a charity event and invite Rocky for ""the fight of the century"". And fighters fight I was reluctant to see ""Rocky Balboa"", but fortunately the high IMDb Rating convinced me to see this great movie, if not the best of the ""Rocky"" franchise. The plot is very well constructed, but the most important are the messages in the lines of the simple Rocky. His speech to his son is amazing and his attitudes are great examples to be followed. I have recently seen the last ""Rambo"" and together with ""Rocky Balboa"" I dare to write that Sylvester Stallone proves that ""the last thing to age in some body is their heart"". Congratulations to him! My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Rocky Balboa""",Rocky Balboa
3,classicsoncall,"""You're a crazy old man.""",8,29 December 2006,"The naysayers and nitpickers will have their input, but for those of us who aged gracefully along with the Rocky franchise, the final chapter is a fitting capstone to not only the movie boxer's career, but an effective take on growing older and wiser in a world obsessed with flash and style. Over the years, Rocky has come to epitomize the club fighter in all of us, no matter what our chosen profession. Usually that means life as a journeyman on the undercard, but sometimes you get to appear in a main event, and in those rare instances, even come away with the title.Films like ""Rocky"" (the original) have always been my favorites, the classic underdog rising against insurmountable odds to attain victory, or at least the semblance of one. In ""Rocky Balboa"", the human opponent may be Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), but the unseen opponent is a leveler of champions known as Father Time. Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), like many who have achieved success, still maintains that undefinable hunger for something more, something nameless that itches where it can't be scratched.The side stories with Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) and 'Little' Marie (Geraldine Hughes) offer a human dimension to the former champ's world, even as he struggles to overcome the grief at the loss of his wife. I had the sense while watching that this may not be the last time we hear from Rocky Balboa. The story presented too many set ups to explore down the road, not as a boxing film, but as a step into retirement and old age for the Rock. Otherwise, why reintroduce the character of Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son? At least it's something I began to think about, and time will tell if the idea is far-fetched or not.As for the boxing itself, I had to wonder about the whole business of a championship exhibition. It seemed to me that once the wheels began turning, the principals involved seemed to be at odds with their original positions. For Rocky, standing toe to toe with the much younger champion would have been an impressive feat, but suddenly he begins to think in terms of winning the event. Whereas Dixon, known for obliterating the opponents in his division, offers Rocky a way to save face by not pushing the match. It's unclear to me how the story could have been pulled off in any other manner than the way it went down, as an actual contest between the two men; certainly that wasn't exhibition sweat and blood coming off the boxers.One of the ironies of the film I thought, was the appearance of Mike Tyson at ringside for the fight, as if representing the chaos and tumult of the heavyweight boxing division as it exists today. Never would I have imagined that the name of the world champion be any less than a household word, but there are times now when I have to stop and try to remember who the current champion is.Here's a thought. Going in, you had to know that for the film to work, Rocky would have to acquit himself well and come out a hero, which of course he did. But my alternate ending would have capitalized on the split decision outcome by having the ring announcer's voice drowned out by the roar of the crowd, allowing the viewer to arrive at their own answer as to who won the match. When I ran the idea by a friend of mine, he said he believed the majority of movie goers would be p---ed by that kind of ending. My reaction - then that's fine, because a lot of movie goers wind up being p---ed anyway, if the comments on this site are any indication. Why not give them something to really get steamed about, and force them to think about what they just watched. Besides, 'Rocky VII' will have answered the question anyway.By the way, I wonder who took care of 'Cuff' and 'Link' all these years?",Rocky Balboa
4,jboothmillard,Rocky Balboa,5,4 August 2013,"The original Rocky was a brilliant film, the second and the third film were alright, and the fourth and fifth films were terrible, and it had been sixteen years since the last film of the popular series, this would be interesting to see, directed by its star Sylvester Stallone. Basically Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is in his late fifties and has been retired from boxing for sixteen years, he is a widower after wife Adrian Pennino Balboa (Talia Shire) died in 2002 from cancer, he runs a successful Italian restaurant, and he is trying to form a better relationship with his estranged son Robert Balboa Jr (Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia). Besides his remaining relationship with supportive brother-in-law and longtime friend Paulie Pennino (Burt Young), Rocky has reunited with a girl he used to know as mischievous in his neighbourhood, Marie (Geraldine Hughes) is now a bartender at the Lucky Seven and a single mother to teenage son Stephenson, aka 'Steps' (James Francis Kelly III), their friendship builds over weeks and Steps sees him like a father figure. Meanwhile, in the boxing world, Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver) has become the new heavyweight champion of the world, and with Balboa still high in their ranks ESPN screen a computer animated simulated fight between the former champion and the new champion, and it appears that Balboa would win the fight. After seeing this on television riles up Dixon, while Rocky is inspired to take up boxing again, and renewing his licence goes public, so his is pitched an idea by Dixon's promoters to do the simulated fight for real, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, to boost Dixon's falling popularity, and to raise money for charity. Robert tries to convince his father not to go ahead with the fight, but Rocky stands his ground, offering him good advice if he wants to achieve something, and the next day they reconcile at Adrian's grave, the son even quits his job to be by his father's side. Rocky starts training with Apollo Creed's old trainer Duke (Tony Burton), knowing that he is much older he builds up his strength and punching power, and the promoted fight has become a pay-per-view event on HBO, with Michael Buffer (with his catchphrase ""Let's get ready to rumble!"") as the ring announcer. Rocky and Dixon have no bad feelings towards each other, but in the ring it is a back and forth fight, Dixon dominates round one, breaking his left hand, and Rocky surprises everyone in the following rounds with his returned power against the much younger opponent, it reaches the final round and both do everything they can, in the end both men thank each other, and by split decision Rocky is the loser, but he is proud to have made a comeback. Also starring A.J. Benza as L.C., Mike Tyson and Lou DiBella. Stallone, at age sixty, still has enough prowess and likability to be a contender, in the role that launched him to stardom, the story for first half is a bit slow and very talky, as the hero exorcises his demons and comes out of retirement, the training in montage with punching meat, running up stairs and the famous music is still good to see, and the main event is most watchable, so all in all it is not a bad sports drama. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and ""Yo, Adrian."" was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Worth watching!",Rocky Balboa
5,ccthemovieman-1,A Shock: This Is One Classy Film!,10,4 April 2007,"Wow, this was not what I was expecting!The story was a lot slower than any Rocky film since the first one in the mid '70s, but I'm not complaining. When it was all over, I thought this was probably the best-made Rocky film of them all. I never thought I would describe a Rocky movie as ""classy,"" but this one deserves that adjective. It may be the least entertaining, as far as a lot of action goes, but it is the most classy.I say this mainly for the wonderful, sweet tone to this story: a story of aging boxer who is long past his glory and is still mourning the loss of his wife. (Apparently ""Adrian"" died some time after the last Rocky film.) His wife's death is haunting him, which makes this a very sad film in the first 45 minutes. However, interspersed in Rocky's reflective period is the still the same upbeat, look-at-the-positive side-of-people attitude.Rocky now acts as host of his Philadelphia restaurant and he regales the customers with stories of his past ring successes and seems to enjoy doing it. He still has his old friend ""Paulie"" (Burt Young) dropping by daily. Rocky's now-grown-up son seems to be sullen and resentful of trying to fill Rocky's hometown-hero shoes but dad is ever-encouraging. It's obvious Rock still loves people. With that attitude, it's impossible to dislike the man.One of the turning points of the film is when the old fighter gives his son a what's-what speech about life. The veteran pugilist may not be Phi Beta Kappa but he comes up with some very profound statements. His son soon ""sees the light"" about his dad.For those who might be leery about watching yet another Rocky movie filled with over-the- top villains and way overdone ring action, rest easy: you won't see that here. Balboa's training scenes last only a few minutes and the fight doesn't begin until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. Preceding that are melodramatic moments with Rocky's friends, family, and new female friend and her son.....all handled with dignity and class.The cinematography is just beautiful in parts and if you're a student of photography, you'll enjoy viewing this.Sad, nostalgic, yet inspiring and optimistic, I can't recall ever being so impressed with a ""Rocky"" film. Highly recommended.",Rocky Balboa
6,rmax304823,The End of the Rambo.,3,3 May 2008,"The original ""Rocky"" of 30 years ago was enchanting, like an original and quirky fairy tale. Rocky was a lazy club fighter, and sometime mob messenger, in one of the louche neighborhoods of Philadelphia, chosen more or less at random to fight the heavyweight champion of the world. After some hesitation, he accepts the challenge and engages in a brutal training regimen. He become fitter than anyone expected, fights the champion to a stalemate, and marries the homely girl who works in the pet shop. No, he doesn't win the championship, but he wins his wife and gains in self respect.There followed a series of sequels, growing duller and duller, as sequels will. Now, after a long hiatus, Rocky Balboa, now in his 50s, returns to the ring for a ten-round exhibition match with Mason Dixon, the current heavyweight champ.The question is -- why? All the charm of the original has long ago disappeared. Thirty years ago, Rocky's dialog was spare and inarticulate. Now there are preachy encounters with his young son, who tells him that if he, Rocky, humiliates himself by getting back in the ring, he will also humiliate his family. Rocky's riposte is a long speech about how life is lousy and you keep getting hit but it's not how hard you hit back but how hard you can keep getting hit and getting off the canvas and you're not a loser if you have the stuff in the basement and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do and -- well, that's how life is. See? This new Rocky, with a layer of fat tissue under the skin and a rather thicker waist, such as age insists on endowing all of us with, isn't propelled into the ring by the same motives as the earlier Rocky. He's not a seedy, lazy, disrespected nudnik. He still lives in the slums, though for reasons nobody can explain, since he runs a reasonably successful restaurant and is happy telling fight stories. His motives aren't really clear, but as far as the viewer can tell they come closer to pride than to a need for self esteem. Pride may goeth before a fall in the Good Book but not in this script.Sylvester Stallone does a decent job as Rocky, but nobody else in the cast brings much to the party. The script itself isn't much help. It lacks a sense of neighborhood, of local color. (It seems entirely appropriate that the bout is fought in Las Vegas instead of Philadelphia.) In contrast to the direction of the original (John Avildson), Stallone's direction here is pretty poor, sometimes becoming embarrassing, as during the fight, when shots drop into slow motion and black and white and the sound track moans and there are hallucinatory shots of Burgess Meredith and Talia Shire rooting for the battered ex champ.Well, why go on? ""Rocky Balboa"" doesn't have any of the fey quality of the original. It looks like what it is, just another sequel. I wonder why it was made, aside from the obvious reason. Thirty years is a long time. Maybe this was aimed at an audience too young to remember the quality of ""Rocky"", an audience attuned to the simple-mindedness, absence of originality, and zap editing of MTV and all the features that have been influenced by it. Whatever. One hopes that Rocky goes back to his restaurant, lapses into his out-of-shape shape, eats heartily and drinks wine, then falls into a coma during his sleep in another thirty years. More of what we see here will only further demean the unimpeachable qualities of the original.",Rocky Balboa
7,ma-cortes,Nice final chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone,7,6 October 2008,"Rocky now retired lives from records his deceased wife(Talia Shire in archive footage). Again he deals with alcoholic Paulie(Burt Young),and his estranged son(Milo Ventiglimia, substituting to Sage Stallone), a cocky executive. He's owned a restaurant where is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history. Meanwhile he knows a single mother(Geraldine Hughes)and falls in love with her. But Rocky comes out from retirement to combat strongest, youngest and faster contender ; he's Mason 'The line'Dixon(Anthony Taver). Rocky attempts to prove himself and his son.Then he's trained by veteran boxer named Duke(Tony Burton, as Burguess Meredith had dead).This agreeable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'. The movie works at usual manner, fitting appropriately to franchise. Writer-director-actor Stallone new outing is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling. Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by Clark Mathis. The motion picture is lavishly financed by the producers complete saga, Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along with John G Avildsen made the six Rocky.While here the opponent is an invincible young boxer,champ of the world, in former entries the contenders were the following : Rocky 1, a corpulent Carl Weathers; Rocky II again Carl Weathers through a rematch; Rocky II against Mr T from A Team; Rocky IV against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren; and Rock 5 against an ingrate young fighter who he trained played by Tommy Morrison.",Rocky Balboa
8,BA_Harrison,Rocky's comeback movie.,8,7 September 2019,"It's tough growing old, but even though the body starts to crumble and the mind slowly fades, the fight should go on; this message, which will resonate with long-time fans of the series, is at the heart of Rocky Balboa, and makes for an emotional return for America's greatest fictional sporting hero.In the years since returning to his old Philly stomping ground, Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has lost his beloved wife Adrian to cancer, and settled into retirement from boxing, the heavyweight champ now running a restaurant called Adrian's. His son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) has very little time for his old man, bitter that he has lived for so long in his father's shadow. Feeling lonely, Rocky befriends bar-woman Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son Steps (James Francis Kelly III), who support the ageing boxer when he decides that what he really wants to do is return to the ring.Stallone returns to the directing chair for this sixth film in the long-running franchise, and he does a great job, carefully balancing the sentimentality with the action, never letting things get too schmaltzy or too cheesy. Rocky's fight to pick up the pieces and keep moving forward is inspirational, his kind nature is heart-warming, and his motivational speech to his son is frank yet touching. The final 'exhibition' match between Balboa and current heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver) proves that the film's star still has what it takes in the ring, the fight being just as hard-hitting and tense as those against his opponents in parts one to four (the less said about Tommy Gunn the better).While I could have done without all of the fancy visual touches during the closing fight (rapid cuts between full colour and black and white), Rocky V ably proves that comebacks are possible, even this late in the day.",Rocky Balboa
9,Quinoa1984,certainly the finest Rocky sequel in spirit to the original,8,1 July 2009,"As far as the Rocky franchise goes, nothing really comes close to the original in terms of its intimate scope and epic grandeur on a low-budget (not to mention top-notch and near iconic cast). In terms of the sequels, while it's not always looked upon as the ""best"", I have a fondness for part 3, if only for its balance of drama and comedy and that it bridges the gap between the early part of the franchise and latter part. And yet in this final installment, Rocky Balboa, Stallone goes back to the roots: the dark and rundown streets of South Philadelphia, and while his film starts as a kind of eulogy for the series (not least of which for the character Adrian), it quickly kicks into gear as a celebration of what Rocky is all about. It's essentially a story of rising to a challenge, proving your worth to nobody in-particular except yourself, and also sticking close as possible to those you care about, family and friends... and the occasional awesome training montage doesn't hurt.In this segment Rocky is in his 50s and runs a restaurant called Adrian's where he reminisces with the patrons with old stories. He also befriends a woman whom he used to walk home many years ago (she may have been a character in the original Rocky, I can't recall) who also has a son named ""Stephs"" for Stephen. But with his son unsure about what his father's legacy has on him, and Rocky's own unsure feelings about the ""basement"" inside of himself, of pain over Adrian dying, he decides to get back into fighting again. In typical ""movie"" style (and I mean this as a compliment to the conventional wisdom of the writing), a challenger comes forward, young Mason Dixon, who is undefeated and has come under scrutiny due to a computer simulation that shows Rocky, in his prime, could kick his ass. So, training commences, speeches of inspiration/hope delivered, and it all leads up to the big bout in Vegas.The script, as mentioned, is perhaps the strongest thing here. Stallone shines as usual in his quintessential role, and seeing people like Paulie and Apollo Creed's former trainer played by Tony Burton are nice touches too. Little flaws: Milo Ventimiglia Jr, despite having the same ""jaw"" as Stallone put it, is not a very good actor here. I'm not sure if it was the direction he was given for the character or just how he is, but he was constantly stiff and then when called upon to get big in a dramatic scene like the confrontation with Rocky outside the restaurant (one of those ""Don't do this!"" scenes), it falls totally flat. There's also a beef one can have with the way inspiration is summoned in the climactic bout. When we see Rocky and Dixon fighting with just the normal camera angles it's riveting and taut, but then Stallone piles on the clips, the flashbacks, the slivers of nostalgia, and it just gets a little too much and almost (key word 'almost') spoils the momentum of one of the best fights in the entire franchise.Sure, some of its humor is a little corny, and some of the line deliveries by Stallone aren't always given the biggest ""umph"" one would want (hey, it's Stallone, waddaya want), but it is a true-blue Rocky movie, and makes a fine sort of comeback note to a franchise that had its ups and downs over the 70s and 80s. It's nothing if not from the heart, in its craft and in its performances, and it should be admired as one of those final bows to an audience that knows this is the end, as opposed to dragging it out even further.",Rocky Balboa
10,tavm,Rocky Balboa is okay for a possible series finale,5,7 January 2007,"Having not seen this friend of mine since Christmas Day and not having given him a present either on that day, I offered to pay admission and concession for him on Rocky Bolboa. He was a big fan of Stallone for the past 30 years and some of the good reviews this movie got made me want to see it too. While it was nice to see Sly and Burt Young again and some of the other characters from previous Rockys, I must admit to feeling a little underwhelmed by both the pace and some of the disjointedness of the overall structure of the picture. Despite some inspirational scenes of Stallone defending his dreams and some nice performances by Young and Geraldine Hughes, by the end I just felt the whole thing was okay. Even the fighting scenes-while exciting-felt anti-climatic. Having said that, this was certainly a more worthy series entry than Rocky 5 (which I barely remember) and my friend had a good time. So if you're curious to see how Rocky Balboa ends the series (assuming no other sequels are made), I'll just simply say it's worth a look.",Rocky Balboa
11,edwagreen,Rocky Balboa-Enough Already **1/2,6,11 April 2007,"Interesting but over-the-top story about Rocky Balboa's life 30 years after his title bout. The area of his fame is now a slum and his grown son is basically ashamed to be around him. Rocky's appearance is one of being totally punched out.Enough of these Rocky stories already. Will we soon have Rocky Collects Social Security or Rocky Goes for Angioplasty?That being said, there are some good moments here as Rocky seeks one more fight to basically show that he is not over the hill. His son comes to his senses and leaves the firm he works at since he never really fit in to begin with. From the beginning of the film, the son does look like he is having a grand time.As his brother-in-law-trainer, Burt Young puts in another good performance. Rocky, now a widower, meets up with a single mother of a black youth. The latter looks like he wants his story to be told but this is never realized. Though Rocky may be falling for this woman, there are still frequent visits to the cemetery. Yo! Adrian!The ending is satisfying. Hopefully, this literally will be the finale.",Rocky Balboa
12,BandSAboutMovies,A better close,8,13 August 2019,"Sylvester Stallone believed that he was negligent when he made Rocky V, as it left both him and his fans disappointed as the end of the series. So that's where Rocky Balboa comes from and much like other movies Stallone has made, the storyline mirrors his own struggles and triumphs.Rocky is still living in the same Philadelphia neighborhood, but now he's a widower. He runs his own restaurant named Adrian's named after his ex-wife. Two characters from the past return - Marie, a younger and troubled woman, and Rocky's first opponent, Spider Rico.First off, how does Rocky fight again after how bad he was in the fifth movie? Let Sylvester himself tell you: ""When Rocky was diagnosed with brain damage, it must be noted that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.""Rocky does more than fight a new boxer - Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, played by real boxer Antonio Tarver - he's also battling grief and to stay in the life of his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia). Paulie (Burt Young) is still in his life, but he's dealing with the end of his work life and the guilt he feels over how he treated his sister while she was alive.One night, Rocky reconnects with a woman named Marie, who he once escorted home when she was in her teens. She has a son named Stephenson who takes to Rocky as well and this helps him through his pain.But who is Mason Dixon? He's a boxer that the public has turned on and an ESPN story where Rocky would defeat him in a computer simulation. This reminds him of what his old trainer told him: if he wants to gain respect, he needs to earn it through the right opponent.This starts Rocky back in the ring, as Dixon's promoters pitch the idea of holding a charity exhibition bout in Las Vegas. The story is that Rocky is a has been and Dixon may be a never was, but the public falls in love with the story.The best part of this movie is when Robert tells Rocky that his father's shadow has caused him to fail. The hero takes a step and unleashes a speech that I have seen on so many walls: ""The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!"" I can't even read these words without getting emotional.At Adrian's grave, Rocky and Robert come together. Our hero starts training again with Apollo Creed's old trainer, Duke (Tony Burton), who explains that Rocky can't win by speed any longer, so he has to increase his power.The fight goes the full ten rounds and ends with both men standing. Rocky lands the last punch (and wins the fight in an alternate cut of the film). Rocky thanks an appreciative Dixon for the match, which has given both men exactly what they need.The movie closes with Rocky at Adrian's grave, saying ""Yo Adrian, we did it. We did it.""As disappointing as Rocky V is, Rocky Balboa is perfect. If this was the end of the Rocky saga, it'd be a fine close. However, the character would continue in the Creed movies. This was an emotional watch for me and quite cathartic.",Rocky Balboa
13,michaelRokeefe,Rocky VI...running on heart and soul.,7,28 March 2007,"First of all, you may be thinking that the sixth installment of the Rocky franchise will be very predictable...not exactly. Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone)an underdog? The ever-popular Italian Stallion comes out of retirement when a highly publicized virtual match between the ex-champ and the current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon(Antonio Tarver)ends in victory for the aged Balboa. The Dixon ego is fueled and he reluctantly agrees to an exhibition match...televised from Las Vegas. Rocky's son and friends disbelieve that the former two-time champ can enter the ring without embarrassment. Passion, spirit and absolute fortitude summons up all that Rocky has to give. Dixon is much younger, faster and stronger; but that will not mean the scheduled 10 round fight will be an easy task. What happens is one of the hardest-hitting and punishing matches in boxing history. Also featured in the cast: Geraldine Hughes, Burt Young, James Francis Kelly III, Tony Burton and Milo Ventimiglia. Astonishing is the shape Stallone is in. I found Hughes impressive. And note that Tarver is a former lightweight world champion.",Rocky Balboa
14,sunwarrior13,Rocky Balboa Gives A Great Conclusion,10,23 October 2011,"Rocky Balboa is ""THE"" sequel to Rocky,the greatest underdog movie of all-time.Although the Rocky franchise has made many like Rocky's II,III,IV,V and this film,it is the only one that holds the candle to it.Despite of not having Talia Shire,who portrays a major role Rocky's wife Adrian - who has served his major inspiration in the first five films not being present in the film,I still consider it one of the best sports films ever made as it brings back the memories of the first film. Rocky Balboa is starred,written and directed by Sylvester Stallone,who for the final time portrays the underdog pugilist,Rocky.Aside from Stallone,the movie also stars the film stars Burt Young as Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law, and real-life boxer Antonio Tarver as Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the current World Heavyweight Champion in the film and Milo Ventimiglia plays Rocky's son Robert,now an adult.The movie begins with Rocky still mourning the death of his loyal and beloved wife, Adrian, who died three years previously after losing a battle against cancer. He now owns an Italian restaurant and spends his days living in his working-class Philadelphia neighborhood, visiting with his customers, and telling stories about his past. His grown son has a job as a business professional, but the relationship between the two is strained. Rocky's growing dissatisfaction leads him to attempt to purge the feelings of frustration and loss by applying for a boxing license. When the current heavyweight champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, needs to rehabilitate his image as a pretty boy who has never shown any real heart in the ring, his manager offers Rocky an exhibition match. This comeback allows Rocky to get his own life back on track, while also offering him the opportunity to help those around him redeem themselves and once again be a symbol of hope for the common man.I think that this theme once again gives inspiration to many Americans who are currently suffering from the present economic difficulties brought about by The Great Recession.Aside from that,it brings back the memories of the underdog theme of the first film,Rocky.The acting of the movie was good but not great especially as Stallone tries his best to relive his role - this time an aging Rocky,who is currently suffering from many the death of his wife and his strained relationship with his son.The story is something that many people would respond to as it was entertaining and poignant.The only thing about it is it is implausible and far from realistic particularly Rocky fighting a world champion in the ring at 60 years of age.Nevertheless,the film was a box office hit and that only states that people has loved Rocky Balboa all throughout these years.And this film total is a great final installment of the great Rocky franchise.",Rocky Balboa

16,Scarecrow-88,Rocky Balboa,7,30 December 2006,"For those who have a place in your heart for this beloved character perhaps will hold this film to high esteem. To be honest, I was holding back the tears in the very first few moments because The Rock was visiting his darling wife's grave. He is quietly enigmatic as he frequents the old Philly streets of his youth pulling the memories that flow deep down in his heart..just reminiscing those cherished times between him and his Adrian. I believe the film is not just a final decisive close for the old champ, but a loving ode to Philly where the man is an icon. Stallone pours his heart and soul into this character making him so vivid and real. You love him because The Rock is a representation of old school hard work, guts and determination.The film itself has a nearly 60-year old arthritic restaurateur Rocky, who shares experiences in the ring with those who visit his food establishment, contemplating a return to the ring. He doesn't know that the ""money-people"" behind Boxing Champ ""The Line"" Dixon want The Rock to have an exhibition bout with their champ for charity. It all spurns from an outcry at a very simple little experiment ESPN ran regarding a computer simulated fight between Rocky, in his youth, and the now-Champ Dixon. When buzz circulates regarding The Rock getting cleared by the boxing commission to fight, Dixon's people definitely see the dollar-signs this fight would fork in.The film is ultimately about Rocky having one last chance to prove to himself, he can go one last fight with a real competitor. Like the film itself, Stallone allows the character to go out with a sterling close. The fight itself is often been criticized, but I felt it had enough action to satisfy those looking for action. It is heavily edited, but we see lots of impacting blows and Stallone shows how great his physique is at such an older age.The only major character returning to this film is Paulie(Burt Young), Talia Shire's Adrian is viewed through Rocky's eyes in haunting ghostly flashbacks when he frequents areas where they bonded as love-partners. Milo Ventimigilia plays Rocky's son. Geraldine Hughes is really good as Rocky's possible love-interest Marie(this growing relationship makes up a good portion of the film as Rocky bonds with Marie's son ""Steps""). Tony Burton makes a surprising turn as Duke, the man who reshapes Rocky's work-out regimen.",Rocky Balboa
17,CinemaSerf,Says a lot about the reason why many boxers actually fight in the first place!,7,25 October 2020,"""Rocky"" (Sylvester Stallone) has long since hung up his gloves and runs a small restaurant in Philadelphia juggling his business and his relationship with estranged son ""Robert"" (Milo Ventimiglia). When a news network screens a virtual simulation of a fight versus current champ ""Mason Dixon"" (Antonio Tarver); the media goes mad and soon he is being tempted to get back into the ring to prove who is best! The plot is ropey, no doubt about that, but this film is about spirit. He recruits his initially sceptical son, his former trainer ""Paulie"" (Burt Young) and sets out to prove to himself, no-one else, that he still has what it takes. Stallone is super; and his work both in front and behind the camera proves that he is not amateur when it comes to films like this. It's way better than most of the sequels (except, maybe Rocky IV) and is well worth catching up with as a testament to grit, determination and a large helping of humanity and decency.",Rocky Balboa
18,dbborroughs,Worthy sequel to an Oscar winning classic,8,31 January 2007,"The plot of the movie has Rocky still wanting to fight, still wanting to feel alive. Adrian has been gone for three years and his son is lost living in the shadow of a legend. Rocky survives by running a restaurant. When a boxing program that uses computers to pick the best fighter ever finds that Rocky would beat the current champ, Mason Dixon, an equally lost soul, the stage is set for a fight in the real world.This is not a fight film. Just like the first film, and to a lesser degree the second film, this is a movie about the characters. Its how they all interact thats important, indeed just like the first film the outcome of the fight is pushed to the background as we see the characters interact with each other. The movie works because Stallone has once again found his strength in characters and the writing is crisp. Its clear Stallone has rediscovered much since the last film about life and people and he's back in the territory that allowed the first film to win a Best Picture Oscar.I'm going to say something, and its not meant to damn the film but to express my feelings toward the film: If this film had a different director it would have been a classic. Stallone has written a damn good script but something about his direction is lacking. Maybe its the feeling that scenes are missing or that maybe the camera hangs a little too much on Rocky, but what ever it is, this addition to the Rocky saga hovers near classic territory but some how manages never to cross over despite some great moments. There is something about the film that just misses.I'm guessing that the film suffers (to a much lesser degree) from the same problem that the last film did, which was a need to please. I saw Rocky 5 as a rough cut a few weeks before it was released. The film played out very differently than the finished film and was less rousing and more serious. Somewhere along the way they changed the film to be crowd pleasing and made it something less (much less) than it was (I won't watch Rocky 5 because the changes are just so bad).I really liked this movie. I would say that its probably the only worth sequel to the first film (or maybe the first two). I'm unsure whether you could just watch the first film and have this work since much of the drama refers to what happened in all the earlier films.Yea it choked me up and brought a tear to my eye.Worth a look especially if you're a fan-especially of the first film.",Rocky Balboa
19,Bunuel1976,"ROCKY BALBOA (Sylvester Stallone, 2006) ***",7,2 January 2007,"The sixth ROCKY entry comes tiptoeing out of retirement after a 16-year hiatus and, against all expectations, practically revitalizes the initially highly-successful but subsequently maligned franchise. Sylvester Stallone takes complete control once again by starring in, writing, directing and serving as executive producer of this flawed but well-crafted and solidly entertaining audience-pleaser.I say flawed because of several (mostly plot-related) factors: firstly, Stallone is 60 years old and while not especially looking it, his physique has taken an undeniably flabby appearance (particularly the face) which does not exactly lend credence to the fact that the Boxing Commission eventually permits him to ply his past trade once more; the brain damage implications which arose in ROCKY V (1990) are completely omitted here; Rocky is now a widower and, although we see him sitting by his wife's grave several times throughout the film, Stallone could not resist giving in to convention and minority groups by introducing an unlikely - and saccharine - love interest in the figure of an old acquaintance (Geraldine Hughes) and her half-Jamaican son; his ringside opponent here (Antonio Tarver), while still colored as had been Rocky's most formidable nemesis Apollo Creed, sports none of Carl Weathers' charisma or panache (which made one care for the character if not exactly cheer for him), even if this could constitute a sarcastic jab by Stallone at today's utterly colorless {sic} celebrities in most entertainment spectrums.Even so, the film has other assets in Stallone's own determined, even moving performance, the presence of the grouchy (but always welcome) Burt Young and, most surprisingly, a well-written, perceptive script which highlights not only the plight of an ex-World Champion prize-fighter in today's disrespectful age dominated by computers and the search for increase of wealth over the old-fashioned values of dignity and pride but also, in the film's emotional highlight, the strained father-son relationship which arises when the younger generation has to regretfully live under the old one's (however pale) shadow. One cannot review a ROCKY film without mentioning the climactic boxing match and the one we have here, while understandably (and judiciously) more muted than the ones we had in the first four entries in the series, is still quite satisfying and invigorating.All in all, while I can't really join in the ""Oscar buzz"" chorus which was bandied about by a few here, Stallone would surely be in the running had there been an Academy Award for Best Comeback of the Year.",Rocky Balboa
20,writers_reign,One More Time,8,30 January 2007,"Surprisingly for someone with a predilection for chamber/Art House movies especially French and especially NOT the Hollywood of recent years I found a lot to like here. Okay, the schmaltz is as high as a week-old steak pie but Stallone has gone to bat for the Over-The-Hill brigade and portrayed them as above all gutsy and Honorable. He turns out to be surprisingly good on relationships and instead of offering something as tawdry as Venus in which an old man lusts after a young girl he gives us a warm, intimate NON-Intimate friendship between a widower still deeply in love with his wife and a woman some twenty years younger. He mixes in just the right amount of aggression, hype and, of course, this being part of the Rocky franchise, action. For someone primarily thought of as a dumb 'animal' a la John Rambo etc Stallone displays a sure touch as a Double-Threat Writer/Director, something I would guess that is beyond the Schwartzeneggers and Van Damns. Really worth seeing.",Rocky Balboa
21,utgard14,"""You throw a big shadow.""",6,8 July 2015,"Sixteen years after the last (and worst) Rocky movie, Sylvester Stallone dusts off his boxing gloves and brings Rocky Balboa back for one more fight. This time Rocky is dealing with the loss of his beloved wife Adrian and his estranged relationship with his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia). When a computer-simulated boxing match has Rocky beating the current heavyweight champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), he decides to step out of retirement and put on the gloves again. Which, of course, leads to an inevitable challenge from Dixon. Despite the thirty year age difference, Rocky accepts and steps into the ring to give Dixon the fight of his life.Sly Stallone returns not only as the star but the writer and director as well. The character is safe in his hands like he would be with no one else. Stallone crafts a touching, emotional story that reminds us why we fell in love with Rocky in the first place. Burt Young also returns as Paulie and he's as gruff and funny as ever. Sadly Talia Shire does not return except through flashback footage (Adrian having died between the last film and this one). Milo Ventimiglia is ideal casting as Rocky's son given his physical similarity to Stallone. He's terrific in the part. Also returning is Tony Burton, one of the unsung heroes of the first four movies. Real-life boxer Antonio Tarver isn't much of an actor but the movie gives him little to do on that front. Which is probably a wise move after the embarrassing performance of Tommy Morrison in Rocky V.It's a little slow-going and the big fight is underwhelming but, overall, it's a good character-driven movie. It's a fitting finale to Rocky's story, although there is more to come with the spin off movie about Apollo's son. But this was a good ending with nice nods to the previous movies, particularly the first, and some ""full circle"" elements that play better than those things often do.",Rocky Balboa
22,lastliberal,Let's start building some hurting bombs.,8,4 May 2008,"I really thought that I would be disappointed by this movie. The thought of Sylvester Stallone boxing at 60 was funny. I mean the guy is four years older than I am and I wouldn't even think of doing that!But, I was surprised that the boxing was not the main focus of this movie. It was about standing up in the face of adversity and staying the course no matter how many times you get knocked down. Like the boxer Husky Miller says in Carmen Jones: ""Big boy, remember, You mus' remember... Stan' up an' fight until you hear de bell, Stan' toe to toe, Trade blow fer blow, Keep punchin' till you make yer punches tell, Show dat crowd watcher know! Until you hear dat bell, Dat final bell, Stan' up an' fight like hell!""Rocky knew he had another fight in him and wasn't going to listen to the naysayers. he just stood up and did his best.

23,zardoz-13,Rocky's Last Bout,4,31 December 2006,"Everything that made the best ""Rocky"" movies (""Rocky,"" ""Rocky III,"" and ""Rocky IV"") blissfully entertaining appears conspicuously absent in Sylvester Stallone's new movie ""Rocky Balboa,"" reputedly the last hurrah for the ""Rocky"" character. Chiefly, ""Rocky Balboa"" lacks spontaneity and surprises. Indeed, actor/athletic Sylvester Stallone looksfor a man in his sixtieslike he could go the distance in the ring, but writer/director Sylvester Stallone virtually recycles the original without anything that made it Academy Awarding material. In ""Rocky,"" Stallone created a charming Brando-esquire misfit, surrounded by other larger-than-life misfits, who slugged his way to the top of the American dream. Each sequel eroded the title character's charisma, and you knew that ""Rocky"" could never go down for the count. Worse, Stallone's trademark aphoristic dialogue yields few quotable lines. Another element woefully amiss is a solid villain. A third of what made ""Rocky,"" ""Rocky III,"" and ""Rocky IV"" engaging on a visceral level were the opponents. Carl Weathers established the baseline for Rocky's rivals in the first two ""Rocky"" movies, while a pugnacious Mr. T raised the bar in ""Rocky III"" and Goliath-like Dolph Lundgren took it one punch further in ""Rocky IV."" Not surprisingly, ""Rocky Balboa"" should take the bad taste of ""Rocky V"" out of the mouth of ""Rocky"" fans. ""Rocky V"" featured the least intimidating contender of the series. Unfortunately, as much as ""Rocky Balboa"" surpasses ""Rocky V,"" Rocky's latest adversary is bland to his boxers. Mason Dixon emerges as more vulnerable than vicious. You won't care if Rocky beats him to a pulp, gets beaten to a pulp himself, or they fight to a draw in ""Rocky Balboa."" This painfully predictable punching bag of clichés never generates the blood, sweat, and cheers of the original.Anybody who remembers the forgettable ""Rocky V"" knows that the doctors warned Rocky that if he ever climbed back into the ring that he could possibly die from one blow to the brain. In ""Rocky Balboa,"" Rocky's physical ailments never impair his potential. Aside from a brief bout with the Pennsylvania boxing commission, Rocky obtains a license to box again. During the first hour of the action, our world-weary hero revisits his past on a sight-seeing trip to his old stomping grounds where he grew up and met his wife Adrian. Adrian has followed in the footsteps of more memorable ""Rocky"" characters, such as Apollo Creed and actor Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill. We learn in ""Rocky Balboa"" that Adrian died from cancer back in the 1990s, and Rocky supports himself with a Philadelphia restaurant named after her. He recounts his pugilistic exploits for the entertainment of his customers. Meanwhile, in the ring, the latest heavyweight boxing champ Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (ex-light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) finds himself tangled up in the ropes of his own troubles. After 30 knock-out fights, the undefeated Dixon cannot find anybody to go toe-to-toe with who can match his merciless barrage of blows. Worse, just about everybody in the fight game hates him. Sure, Dixon sounds like a terrific adversary, but Stallone gives Tarver nothing to do or say that makes his character remotely dangerous. He never attains the flamboyance of the egotistical Apollo Creed in the first three ""Rocky"" epics. He doesn't present a challenge like the sadistic Clubber Lang in ""Rocky III."" Physically, he is no match for towering Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV."" Instead, Mason Dixie emerges more as misunderstood than merciless.During his tour of his old neighborhood, Rocky runs into a local girl from his past. Marie (as played by the original ""Marie"" Geraldine Hughes) told him to bug off in the original when he offered her advice about her friends. Marie and Rocky get friendly this time around and the ex-champ shows an interest in her fatherless son. Unfortunately, the romance between Marie and Rocky ignites no sparks because the chemistry between them is wrong. At the same time, Rocky's own son Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia who plays Peter Petrelli on the NBC/SCI-FI Channel TV show ""Heroes"") has his own selfish issues. Rocky overshadows him. At one point, Rocky confides in his boorish brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young of ""The Killer Elite"") that he still has his own unresolved issues. Paulie thinks Rocky has lost his mind when he proposes to put the gloves back on for one more bout. The inevitable fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon occurs as a result of an ESPN computer generated boxing match that prompts Mason's managers to approach Rocky about a match. Mason Dixie derides it as a publicity stunt, but Rocky sees it as a place in the sun. ""Rocky Balboa"" boasts too much soul and not enough heart. Cue ""Rocky"" composer Bill Conti to bring on the music from the original as Rocky jogs around Philadelphia in his sweats training.Sylvester Stallone looks more muscle-bound than ever, but he does not have the underdog charisma of the best ""Rocky"" movies. Clearly, Stallone has gone into the ring one time too often. The Rocky character has never looked so out of place and his actions do little to endear him. Stallone's worst mistake in ""Rocky Balboa"" was sacrificing Adrian from his screenplay than his obnoxious, cigar-chomping brother-in-law Paulie. The first hour of the new ""Rocky"" drags and the last forty minutes doesn't make up for it. Stallone stages the boxing match without flair. Amazingly, the hand-held photography doesn't add energy to the fight. Despite some moments that remain too far and few between, ""Rocky Balboa"" has no clout to flout.",Rocky Balboa
24,grantss,Rivals Rocky IV for silliness of plot,3,13 April 2015,"Just when you thought Rocky plots couldn't get more silly than Rocky IV, where Rocky comes out of retirement to fight a Russian in Russia during the Cold War, we have this, Rocky Balboa (effectively Rocky VI). 16 years after Rocky V, a 60-year old Rocky comes out of retirement to fight the current heavyweight champion of the world. (Or, more accurately, a 60-year old Sylvester Stallone unretires Rocky in order to squeeze the last few dollars out of the name).Not that Rocky, the movies, was that good to start off with. The first one was dull, implausible, badly acted (except for Talia Shire) and vastly overrated. Rocky II was a slight improvement in that it had a more plausible and engaging plot, though pretty much relied on the same formula as the first movie.Rocky III was pretty much more of the same formula. Rocky IV was silly. Rocky V had lots of potential but squandered it all in reverting to formula.Rocky Balboa: same formula, even more silly.",Rocky Balboa
25,view_and_review,This Movie Shouldn't Have Been Licensed,3,25 March 2021,"I have a new proposal. Just like old boxers have to go before the boxing commission to get licensed to fight, so should old actors looking to reprise roles of their younger selves. I actually went into this movie thinking that Rocky was going to be a trainer like he was in ""Rocky V"" (though he ended up fighting his pupil) and how he was in ""Creed."" I had no interest in seeing this AARP member in the ring against a guy less than half his age. What started off as slow and melodramatic, morphed into something absurd and improbable. It was thirty years before that Rocky first stepped into the ring to fight Apollo Creed. That movie became a classic film that will never be forgotten. Even the sequels were epic. Then they got to part five in 1990 and things fell apart. It was an ugly way to go out, but at least the saga was over... so we thought. Sixteen years after his last Rocky, Sylvester Stallone limps back on screen trying to fool the public into believing he still has it. Talia Shire apparently wanted no part of a sixth Rocky, so we just get flashbacks of her, and Rocky visiting her grave. After dragging the movie around nowhere in particular and filling the script with bromides, Rocky decides that he wants to fight again. The boxing commission was going to deny him a license until he gave some cliché BS speech about being allowed to do what you want and not being too old and blah blah blah. It wasn't very moving, nor was it something a commission should consider when allowing old fighters to go back in the ring to get their heads lumped some more. Be that as it may, the commission relented and allowed Rocky to fight. Unrelated to Rocky requesting a license was the decline of the heavyweight division in boxing and a computer simulated fight between Rocky in his prime and the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver). The computer simulated fight made Rocky the winner which generated a lot of buzz. Hoping to capitalize on this buzz was Dixon's promoters. They pitched the idea to Rocky that he could fight Dixon in an exhibition fight and Rocky, after hemming and hawing and some resistance from family, accepted the fight. I think the first and most reasonable place to start with this farce is the fact that no self-respecting heavyweight champ is going to fight an over-the-hill retiree unless he was dead broke; which Dixon wasn't. There is no upside to taking such a fight. If he wins, then he should've won anyway, and if he loses, what are you doing losing to an old man? Assuming that the heavyweight champ would take such a fight, what realistically would have been a bloodbath predictably became a closely fought battle in which Rocky had his patented get-back-off-the-mat moments. He took it to Dixon for ten rounds and fought to a draw. The fight sequences were awful and the drama non-existent. It really was sad having to see the ghost of Rocky fight anyone, let alone a real fighter. Truthfully, it was an insult to the sport of boxing. To indicate that a sixty-year-old man could hang with--not just any boxer, but the heavy weight champion--is a huge insult to the sport. You wouldn't see a serious movie in which Troy Aikman and his old Cowboys team got on the field against Tom Brady and the Patriots. ""Rocky Balboa,"" to put it plainly, was a movie that didn't need to be done and shouldn't have been done. It only shows the shamelessness and staleness of Hollywood and the desperation of Stallone to cling to his legacy. That's why he repeatedly does Rockys and Rambos, but both should have long been retired.",Rocky Balboa

28,ferguson-6,Rubber Tree Plant,5,22 December 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Although it is a deserving character and franchise for a proper burial, melancholy was what I most experienced while watching this send off. It is almost sad watching this metaphor for Mr. Stallone's career unfold on the screen.I was so hoping to like this more than I did. The dialogue is laughable and the thought of this do-nothing restaurant oaf getting in good enough shape to go 10 rounds with the heavyweight champ of the world is simply preposterous. Of course, ""Rocky"" was only barely believable in 1976 and what made it so lovable then was the sweetness and purity of the character. Although Stallone tries hard to recapture those traits, sadly history cannot be repeated.The last thing I want to do is go on and on bashing the film. The good points were real life fighter Antonio Tarver as Mason Dixon, Rocky's ring opponent in this one. Also nice is Geraldine Hughes as Rocky's latest save-the-puppy project. The great theme song is given the Muzak treatment with soft piano throughout ... that is a mistake. The flashbacks, while overdone, were at times pretty cool. The in-training segment was too short, while the actual fight scenes were mercifully brief ... although the way Rocky leads with his head, we have to believe if they were really fighting, it would have been much more brief! So, although it is better than most in the series, it doesn't come close to the charm of the 1976 film. R.I.P. Rocky.",Rocky Balboa

Balboa has seen much pass by including the death of his wife, the growth of his son, and the fading of his boxing career. Yet through media encouragement he is faced with a possible bout against current champion Mason Nixon. Huge improvement with Stallone directing and starring. Stallone knows the character inside out and while some of the films falter, what he creates here is one of the best, if not the best of the franchise. Rocky runs a restaurant where he helps those in need but feels the urge to return to the ring to prove that age hasn't slowed him down. Burt Young returns as his trainer and friend who has seen Rocky through it all. Antonio Tarver plays Nixon who feels pressure to prove his notoriety. Geraldine Hughes plays the grown version of the young girl whom he gave good advice to in the original film. It is a reminded that one's goodness does indeed have a lasting impact.

To the astonishment of surviving family and friends, Rocky accepts, and so begins to undergo the hardest re-training of his life, considering how he is close to 60 years old now, fighting a man 30 years younger.It is to the skill of Stallone that he pulls off this unlikely premise and creates a rousing, exciting yet credible finale for Rocky.

With the odds stacked firmly against him, Rocky takes on Dixon in what will become one of his greatest fights......It was a long shot, just how good this film was going to be, Stallone hadn't had a hit in years, and the last Rocky movie didn't have the heart like the previous ones, so this was a huge gamble for him, and one of the most iconic franchises of all time.And Stallone went and did it. Not only did he resurrect his waning career, but he made a really touching drama, and in my opinion,the best Rocky movie out of the lot.This Rocky is a different character from the previous incarnations. Here he is alone, and more fragile than he was before, because he doesn't have Adrian,Mis Rock and his guiding light, for the first time, he has to be alone, and Stallone pulls the heart strings almost five minutes into the film. It could have been so cheesy, but it's done with the right amount of subtlety.The rest of the cast are fantastic also, the only weak link here is his adversary, he's just not got the character like his other foes had, even Tommy Gunn, it just seems like he's just another little child who doesn't like the fact that a simulation made him look a loser.It's beautifully written, Cont usurps his previous score, and the final fight has a wonderfully filmed style to it.Its a brilliant farewell to such a much loved character, and the final scene it pure gold.A brilliant movie.",Rocky Balboa

Well, friends, the guy may have aged with the rest of us but Stallone's ability to go to the heart of the character he has made an icon still is strong. As a result ROCKY BALBOA, though overly sentimental at times (which is in keeping with the Rocky we have all grown to know) plays as a show of strength not only in the boxing ring, but also in the viability of the heart.The aged Rocky runs a restaurant named after his deceased wife Adrian (who gratefully appears in flashbacks of the original Talia Shire) where he chats with his devoted customers as the still admired boxing hero of Philadelphia. His trainer Paulie (Burt Young) has aged too, but the two remain close. Rocky also encounters a lonely single mother Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and befriends her and her racially mixed son Steps (James Francis Kelly III). Mildly estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia) who is trying to make a life for himself in his father's shadow, Rocky happens to see a spoof on television placing Rocky as the contender against the new heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver, a boxer who was groomed as an actor for this film), a fighter who lacks soul and seems to foretell the end of passionate boxing. With such a huge support group Rocky decides to train and actually compete, fighting Dixon with multiple incentives. The ending demonstrates the power of willpower and the greater power of humanity and love because 'you gotta keep movin' forward'.ROCKY BALBOA, then, is a fine finish for a series of films that have gained a permanent place in the history of cinema. It is a pleasure to see Sylvester Stallone act and direct a very fine cast of actors in a genuinely satisfying film. There are many worthwhile messages with the frames of this old-fashioned movie.

33,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Rocky Balboa,8,1 March 2007,"I enjoyed Rocky Balboa tremendously, even though it was formulaic and probably a carbon copy of the original in terms of telling an underdog's tale. Written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, this is very much his comeback movie as it is for his character Rocky Balboa, when the fifth installment of the franchise was considered the weakest of the lot, and a let down to its predecessors. When the movie was announced, many people snickered and wrote it off outright, as being nothing new to offer on the table, of letting dead dogs lie, that Stallone was out of ideas and needed to revisit past glories to try and get his career back on track. However, Rocky Balboa, although it goes full circle and back to the original, is one that is plenty of heart as it parallels loosely the challenges of an ex-star trying to make a return. Of having to address that fire in the belly, of, like Rocky says, clearing stuff in the basement. In this movie, it's been many years since Rocky last fought in the ring, and now into semi- retirement with his laid back style of running an Italian restaurant (with Mexican cooks) named Adrian's (after his wife), sharing ring action stories with his diners, and pining for his deceased wife. A computerized mock fight between Rocky and the current World Heavyweight Champ Mason The Line Dixon (Antonio Tarver) sparked that feeling of wanting to enter the ring inside Rocky, and what I found intriguing was Mason Dixon actually, and the state of the affairs he represents - those without heart, no passion, in it for the money, and competitors who give up easily when the going gets tough. It's not easy being the champion when you have weak competition, and the publicity machinery go into overdrive in setting up a win-win situation between the two fighters.Don't expect much interaction between Rocky and Dixon, as they leave most of their combined screen time to the ring. And for those who thinks that this movie is all about slugging it out, are you so wrong. I tip my hat to Stallone for actually writing a movie with adequate sensitivity, in further developing the Rocky character in his twilight years, and that examination of family life, of developing passion in the things that you do. Rocky Jr (now played by Milo Ventimiglia) forms the main emphasis of this examination, of having to grow up in his father's huge shadow, of being the offspring of someone famous, and the tendency of blaming everyone but himself for his being miserable. That dialogue between father and son, I thought was almost what every father and son relationship would have grappled with at one point or another, and it rings home the message, even as you feel that lump in the throat forming.I felt the much touted bout between Rocky and Dixon was actually quite plain, with fast forwarding used as well as freeze frames, but somehow, the intensity, power, aggression still rang through. In fact, I was almost at the edge of my seat as Rocky and Dixon slugged it out in brutal fashion - gladiator against gladiator, the experienced against the fleet footed, the old school of hard knocks versus the emptiness of current glamour.And there were the classic iconic moments which get repeated, like that run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, that all too familiar musical theme blaring in the background, and the training montage which all but sends goosebumps. The coming together of familiar faces, of old friends, and family, make this very much an ensemble piece orchestrated to an incredible crescendo when it mattered.Rocky Balboa is a fitting finale to the franchise, a worthy tribute and a fitting farewell to a legendary, enduring screen hero who's finally decided to hang up his gloves. I won't be surprised that this movie will actually win over some new fans to the original movies, and one thing's for sure, I'm sold, and I'm recommending this.",Rocky Balboa
34,namashi_1,It Ain't Over!,9,23 March 2011,"A Film as good as 'Rocky Balboa' is hard to make & forget. It's an inspiring, emotional, light-hearted & sincere journey of an Iconic Movie Character, who is in shown to be in the dumps! Sylvester Stallone is a legend. After being declared as one of the most popular & leading actors of all-time, he has even excelled in himself by writing & directing such neat work.The 'Rocky' series have been Iconic. the 1st installment Won 3 Academy-Awards, including Best Picture. The other 2 installments have been widely regarded as memorable fares. But, the 4th as well as the 5th installment, met with mixed reactions. But, 'Rocky Balboa', which is the sixth and final film in the Rocky franchise, makes up for it all the way.Stallone returns as Rocky, the character he confidently immortalized. He delivers an Excellent performance. In fact, this performance can rank amongst his best works. There is another great performance that lies in, Burt Young, who once again plays Paulie, Rocky's moody brother-in-law and buddy. On the whole, It Ain't Over! Rocky Balboa lives on. He's immortal!",Rocky Balboa
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Makes you want to go the distance and hit someone, even if it is 16 years later",5,21 December 2006,"Well, it's better than the 5th Rocky film, but I wasn't too impressed with Rocky Balboa. I was so excited to see Rocky back in the ring, even if Sylvester Stallone is 1600 years old, I'd see Rocky XX! Well, my boyfriend and I were so excited and it was so great to be in that audience last night, the audience was cheering before the movie even started! I never saw that before! People were screaming out the famous lines of the first Rocky and having fun pretending to be Sylvester Stalone, how could anyone not be pumped up to see this film? Well, I'm going to explain the sadness that was the end in just a moment.Adrien has unfortunately passed away, their son, Robert, has grown up trying to separate himself from his famous father, and Rocky has opened up a restaurant to pass time and make some money since he doesn't box any more. But there is a new boxing heavy weight champion, Dixen, who doesn't have much pazazz like Apollo Creed, Mr. T, or Ivan Drago, instead he's kind of a gangsta of some sort. Well, everyone is thinking old school vs. new school and now Rocky must face Dixon in a not so triumphant fight that gets you pumped up and go to the gym after the movie is over.Now, normally some movies get an applause after it's done, and you'd think with this movie there would have been a standing ovation, but instead two people started clapping and one person screamed ""What the hell was that!?"" and someone screamed at the two people ""Man, stop your clapping! Let's go home!"", and my boyfriend and I looked at each other and said ""That's it?"". The training sequence didn't get us pumped up and excited like the others did and we didn't have the typical happy Rocky ending, what the heck?! 5/10 Rocky, I demand a rematch!",Rocky Balboa
36,blanbrn,Filled with emotions. Great way to put closure to a legend.,8,29 December 2006,"Just last weekend before the holidays I went and saw ""Rocky Balboa"" with my father and I must say it doesn't let you down! Picking up from 16 years since the last ""Rocky"" in this latest work of Stallone, you find his Balboa character as a lonely man who's aged and feels droopy. Now Rocky spends his time running an Italian eatery, entertaining customers with his boxing tales, he had to have a new hobby since his wife the beloved Adrian has passed. So instead of grieving his wife's death or fight personal battles with his grown son(Milo Ventimiglia) he feels the need and has that desire one more time, and that is to fight! Rocky fights the fight of his life against the champ Mason ""The Line"" Dixon in Vegas, but remember it's not always if you win it's how hard you fight. Overall this film is very touching it's full of emotions, you feel the pain that Rocky does from his wife's death. Also the flashbacks and clips shown in this film from the previous Rocky movies are moving and bring back great emotional nostalgia. The scenes are well done once again shot on the Philly streets along with climactic montages. After watching this you will once again be touched with emotions and be cheering for the underdog just like you did 30 years ago with the original! ""Rocky Balboa"" puts closure on a legendary figure.",Rocky Balboa
37,MovieAddict2016,"""Balboa"" is a knockout - Stallone's best film in thirty years",8,3 January 2007,"When Sylvester Stallone announced that he wanted to make another ""Rocky"" film, we were still in the 1990s. No studios would finance the project after the critical and commercial failure of John G. Avildsen's ""Rocky V."" For years, it seemed the prospect of another Rocky movie was impossible (and laughable). Stallone's star continued to fade, but in 2005, MGM underwent a management shift, and Sony stepped in and agreed to greenlight Stallone's sixth Rocky film  for a fraction of the costs of the previous sequels, to be filmed low-key and without much of a marketing campaign per se. And here we finally have it: the final Rocky movie.And while it's easy to laugh at the idea of watching a 59-year-old Rocky enter the ring again, don't chuckle yet  the long hiatus gave Stallone time to work diligently on his screenplay, pushing it through multiple re-writes, fixing problems. This is a grungy, down-to-earth Rocky  the real Rocky  and not the over-the-top caricature present in the last two films. The Reagan era theatrics are gone  this is a bleak return to the original character, and the earlier sequels are almost entirely ignored (for good reason).There are a few problems. As always, Stallone uses a lot of clichés in his film  the ""nice guy"" routine worked a bit better in the original movie. (Which isn't to say it doesn't work in ""Balboa""  but it feels a bit corny in today's age.) Stallone also has a tendency to drag in poorly developed subplots  the motivation behind the inclusion of a storyline featuring ""Lil' Marie"" (the girl he walked home in the original movie) and her son, Steps, is admirable; however, it could have been developed further. Similarly, Rocky's relationship with his son in the movie is predictable from the start: it's pure formula. If Stallone had just tweaked these problems a bit, he would have had a complete masterpiece on his hands  easily one of the best films of the year.But as it stands, ""Rocky Balboa""  in spite of its flaws  is still a rewarding achievement; a refreshing return to form for the series and a poignant farewell to the character. After the abysmal ""Rocky V,"" Stallone has returned to his roots and delivered an appropriate goodbye to his most recognizable character.Stallone, in his best performance since ""Cop Land,"" is a beaten man. Rocky's love Adrian has died from cancer, and he runs a humble restaurant in South Philly where he is an unassuming host. Things chance when the current Heavyweight Champion of the World is pitted against Rocky in a virtual reality boxing match on ESPN; the result (Rocky wins) ignites interest in boxing promoters, who convince Rocky to appear in an ""exhibition"" boxing match to reflect the virtual match.Stallone knows how to pace the movie  the first hour is all character study. The training sequences we have come to know from earlier sequels (which have become classically and humorously dated by today's standards) are absent; the modernized training segment is only a minute and a half long, and although it features Bill Conti's iconic ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme, it is noticeably less flashy and over-the-top than the previous movies' training montages; Rocky's trainer explains that by now he already knows the how's and why's of training, and Stallone's decision to shorten the training montage reflects this.The final boxing match is perhaps the first Rocky battle in three decades in which we are unsure of the outcome; there was little doubt in our minds that Rocky would beat Mr. T in the third film, but here, we're not really too sure what's going to happen. Will he win? Will he lose? Will he live? Will he die? It's a testament to the strength of the movie that audiences are left in doubt until the very end.""Rocky Balboa"" is not just good entertainment  it's a solid film with an uplifting message. The original film had a moral, which became increasingly murky in later entries; ""Balboa"" sets the series back on track. It's an inspiring story that reflects Stallone's own struggles over the past decade to get this thing off the ground. His passion shows  this is his most personal project in thirty years and it also reveals just how entwined Stallone and his Rocky alter ego have become over the years. You can easily confuse the two here  it's kind of a bittersweet finale after such a long journey over the years.""Rocky"" fans are going to enjoy this; regular filmgoers are going to walk away feeling pleasantly surprised, inspired and uplifted by a movie with a fairly obvious but nevertheless empowering moral at its center. Stallone has finally  after years of trying  brought back the character we fell in love with in 1976, and seeing the real Rocky one last time was worth the wait.",Rocky Balboa
38,disdressed12,"a very fitting and great end to the series,which recaptures the ""Rocky"" spirit and magic",10,16 April 2007,"this is a great way to end the ""Rocky"" franchise,considering how weak number 5 was.there is some real depth to this entry,and Stallone put in a very heartfelt performance.he can really act,given the right material.Stallone wrote the script,and it is a good script.the movie is much more realistic than i thought it would be.given the premise(an aging ex champ in his 50's fighting the current champ,a man 30 years his junior)the movie would seem absurd,yet it Isn't.you'd have to watch it to understand.when first hearing they were making another installment,i scoffed,thinking it would be ridiculous and stupid.for some reason,though, i decided to watch it,and i am glad i did.this is easily the best installment since number 2,which i believe was the best up to this point.I think ""Rocky Balboa"" is probably as good as 2,and it really recaptures the magic of the earlier entries.this movie is very sentimental,in good way.Stallone makes it inspiring without being preachy.my vote for ""Rocky Balboa"" is 10/10*",Rocky Balboa
39,sddavis63,It's Like Deja Vu All Over Again - But It's Good Fun With A Larger Than Life Character,7,7 October 2009,"Rocky Balboa is larger than life. A lot of Hollywood characters become iconic or symbolic, but somehow Rocky goes beyond that. When the first movie appeared in the 70's it was during a great time for boxing. There were a lot of big names in the sport. Now, 30 years later I honestly can't think of the name of a single significant boxer - heavyweight or otherwise. Who's the current champ? (or, ""champs"" since I assume the crown is still divided?) I don't know. I don't have a clue. But I know Rocky Balboa - to me, I think Rocky will always be the champ.In this most recent movie in the series, there's nothing particularly original. It's basically a rehash of the first. Rocky (Stallone was 60 when this was made, so Rocky must have been 60 too) gets an unexpected chance to fight the current champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, in an exhibition match that comes to be taken quite seriously. Nobody takes Rocky seriously, though, and the big concern is that he might get hurt. Adrian isn't around (in the story, she's deceased) but her presence is all over the place, via pictures, visits to her grave, and the restaurant that Rocky now runs, called - of course - Adrian's. In Talia Shire's absence, there's no real romantic partner for Rocky, although he develops an attachment for Marie, who's tending bar at a local watering hole. She's supposed to be the girl who in the first movie told Rocky ""screw you, creepo,"" after he tried to convince her to hang out with a different crowd. Too bad they didn't get Jodi Letizia (who played Marie in '76) but Geraldine Hughes was fine in the role. Paulie's around, of course, and again played by Burt Young, and once again he comes up with an idea to make money off Rocky's name. Also as in the first movie, the fight goes the distance, and Rocky loses in a split decision. So, in many ways this is like ""deja vu all over again.""There are some differences, of course. The relationship between Rocky and his son is interestingly developed, with Rocky Jr. becoming increasingly resentful of living in his dad's big shadow, and Rocky finally telling him that he has to stop making excuses and get on with life. Mason Dixon wasn't quite as evil as some of Rocky's other opponents (you're certainly not rooting against him the way you were against Clubber Lang, for example.) In spite of those differences, this really does come across as almost a remake of ""Rocky"" rather than the sixth instalment in the series. It's not as good as the original (basically because it's too much like it) but it's still very good. And, it ties up the Rocky series better than Rocky V did. Whatever weaknesses Sylvester Stallone may have as an actor, kudos to him for creating this completely larger than life character who will always be ""the champ."" 7/10",Rocky Balboa
40,sol-kay,When the body goes the arms will follow,8,4 May 2008,"***SPOILERS*** Without a doubt ""Rocky Balboa"" is the best of the six Rocky movies with the exception of the original. Yet even the 1976 boxing classic, just plain ""Rocky"", didn't measure up to the action packed final battle between a 60 year old Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone, and his 25 year-old opponent World Heavyweight Champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon played by former light-heavyweight champ Antnio Tarver.Looking more like a body builder then a boxer Rocky not only could take a punch and give a punch back he also developed into a decent defensive fighter which he wasn't in any of his previous movies. It was Rocky's weaving and bobbing as well as slipping Dixon's cobra like left jabs as well as devastating right uppercuts and left hooks that made it possible for Rocky to survive the bout and, like in the 1976 film, go the distance. In this case the distance was 10 not 15 rounds like in the original film.The years haven't been kind to Rocky Balboa since he hung up his gloves in 1985 after defending his title some dozen times and retiring just shy of his 40th birthday. With his beloved wife Adrian, Talia Shire, passing away due to breast cancer in 2002 Rocky has seemed to have lost touch with the real world. Constantly reminiscing about the past Rocky has let himself go so far down that his son Robbie, Milo Vintimiglia, is actually embarrassed to be seen with him in public.Drifting into total obscurity Rocky suddenly becomes the center of attraction in the world of sports after a computer generated televised boxing match between himself and the champ Mason Dixon has Rocky, after taking a shellacking, knock Dixon out! Not really wanting to fight a man some 35 years his Junior, and the heavyweight champion of the world as well, fate has other plans for the ex, as well as somewhat punch-drunk, champ Rocky Balboa. Rocky is forced by a number of almost providence-like inspired events to not only get his license, at age 60, back to be a professional boxer but end up in the ring at glittering Las Vegas to duke it out with the heavyweight champ!Touching as well as heart-lifting movie with a down and out Rocky Balboa proving to himself as well as those who love him his son Robbie brother-in-law Paulie, Burt Young, and the entire sporting world that he still has it. Courage determination as well as humility together with a heart of gold that never, after all these down years since he retired from the ring, never lost its glitter.The film ""Rocky Balboa"" follows the same storyline of the original ""Rocky"" with Rocky given the chance of a lifetime to fight the heavyweight champion of the world in a more or less exhibition match in Vegas. Not taken serious at all by heavyweight champ Dixon and his handlers Rocky knowing that the only chance to take on the fast punching and speedy Dixon is to use brute force and not try to catch up with him in the ring.Rocky's hard work in lifting as much as 400 pound weights on his back, and running 5 to 6 miles every morning with his dog ""Punchy"", pays off in the end. Rocky is thus able to withstand the ferocious attacks of Dixon and get in some good licks of his own in the champs midsection that makes him both wince and back up from the first time against an opponent in his professional boxing career. This has Dixon drop his guard or hands opening himself up to Rocky's heat detecting missiles aimed at Dixon's head and upper body; Rocky's legendary and explosive right and left handed Susie Q's!Besides the great boxing scenes the film also has a number of very moving sequences between Rocky and his Son Robbie and both Paulie and Marie, Geraldine Hughes. Marie was a, now all grown up, teenage girl that Rocky knew from his old Phillie neighborhood when he was a struggling club fighter back in the 1970's. It was Rocky's rock-like resolve to, like he did all his life, go up against impossible odds that in the end brought the best out of everyone who he came in contact with him. It made Robbie Marie and even former boxing opponent Spider Ricco, Pedro Lovell, feel good not sorry about themselves regardless of what deck of cards, good or bad, they were dealt with in life.",Rocky Balboa
41,FeastMode,my notes,5,26 June 2019,"Decent but kinda boring with a weak villain and the weakest fight of all the movies. did a great job of having the same feel as the older movies, directed the same way with the same type of dialogue and jokes (2 viewings)",Rocky Balboa
42,Robert_duder,"In true Rocky style the ""Underdog"" made us all eat our words",9,22 January 2007,"Most fans of the Rocky series will agree that, from the good to the bad, they are classics and it goes without saying that Rocky Balboa is an iconic film character that won't ever be forgotten. There are few if any people that didn't follow Balboa's career through his rise from the streets to gaining the title, through Mickey's death, Apollo's death and near brain damage. Could they ever bring Rocky back?? The meer thought of it brought eye rolls from fans but didn't we eat our words?? Was there anyone who wasn't sitting there thinking...this is awesome...this is such an incredible justification to wrap up this iconic man's career. To follow up a film nearly 3 decades later took guts and the fact that they did such a great job shows how incredible it really is. The most amazing job they did was made us believe his story was still possible...againSylvester Stallone yet again writes, directs and stars in this sixth installment. However something Stallone manages to do in this film that I don't think he was ever able to do in #'s 3-5 is recapture the true Rocky Balboa...the down to earth, street smart, guy with the droning voice. Rocky is back and his life is very different. His beloved Adrian has died, he runs a restaurant and caters to the customers adoration of his boxing years with stories and pictures. His son is moving up the corporate ladder and has little time for his old man as he struggles to get out from his father's large shadow. And ol' Paulie, on in his years, still working in the meat factory desperately tries to get Rocky to let go of the past. Stallone is amazing and should have gotten at least a Golden Globe nomination out of this but that would have meant the critics would have had to swallow their pride and admit greatness on Stallone's part. Burt Young flawlessly returns as Paulie in the same feisty, tough talking way he always has but with more emotion this time around. Young is terrific and him and Stallone have the chemistry they've always had. Milo Ventimiglia is quite good as Rocky Jr. and this being one of Ventimiglia's first major film roles he did very well opposite Stallone. Geraldine Hughes is good as the girl next door that Rocky takes under his wing to protect from the streets. It wasn't a bad addition to the story line but it was used far too much and the hint of romance that never happens kind of sours that story line even more but Hughes is nonetheless good in her role. Tony Burton returns in a small cameo role as Duke, Rocky's trainer (formerly Apollo's), and Antonio Tarver is Mason 'The Line' Dixon, the World Heavyweight Champion that Rocky wants to spar with. Also returning in a small cameo role is Pedro Lovell who has only had two film roles...this one and the original Rocky as Spider Rico, one of Rocky's original fights. Lovell is and was a real fighter and returned for this part which was kind of touching.Let's talk about mistakes first. This film really was different from the other ones because it wasn't about the fight. There was no real build up, not a lot of training and the actual fight was less of the climax then it was for other Rocky's. This might not have been a mistake but it changed the way Rocky's script plays out which is okay. However one of the big things about Rocky was always the adversary. They built him up, larger than life, introduced you to his life and they barely do that with Mason Dixon. They show a little about his lavish lifestyle much like Rocky used to live, but other than that he doesn't have the character that other adversaries have had and I missed that aspect of Rocky. The story line with ""little Marie"" as nice and cute as it was, was far overplayed and over used. That was my two biggest complaints about the film and the good definitely outweighed the bad. Rocky Balboa still managed to be the love story between Rocky and Adrian even without her there. Rocky loves her with all his heart and even in his final decision to give it one last go in the ring it's all about her. His visits to her grave are emotional and touching and scenes with him and Paulie and flashbacks to her and him together are moving!! The training scene is great but way too short but again this is more about Rocky the man than the fight now. He's aging and feels he needs one more shot to prove it to himself that he could do it and he does. The fight is filmed with great realism and expert director as a pay per view event with (finally) the great Michael Buffer announcing. The action isn't quite as hard core or over the top that it has been previously but more real and astute and there is something to be said about that. The old world of fighting vs the new. This is absolutely the finest follow up to an already classic, incredible series of films and I was so pleased to have seen it in the theater.I must mention that during this film was one of the most amazing moments I have had in a theater. When Duke proclaims ""Let's Build some hurtin' Bombs"" and the music rises up and Rocky begins to work out the entire theater burst into applause and cheers and gave me chills. And during the fight when the crowd began to chant 'Rocky! Rocky!' so did the theater and I just thought that was really cool and showed everyone's respect for the great Rocky Balboa as a cinema icon. Bravo Rocky! Bravo. 9/10",Rocky Balboa
43,ElMaruecan82,"It's not about how hard you get hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward ...",9,30 November 2011,"I didn't even need to copy-paste, I know this line by heart. And when I heard it for the first time in the movie theatre, I knew that whatever would happen from that point, I was probably watching the greatest ""Rocky"" film since the first one, which is saying a lot, considering how deeply rooted in pop-culture the sequel were.Coming from the famous speech Rocky gave to his son Robert, the monologue that started with ""let me tell you something you already know, the world ain't no sunshine and rainbows"" cut straight to my heart. Rocky Jr. starts an angry rant, blaming his father for stealing his life, condemning him to live forever in his shadow, venting many years of repressed anger on his father's face. Then Rocky Balboa, the character who was introduced to cinema thirty years before in an underdog story that would be the inspiration for all the 'little guys' in the world, Rocky, the ex-Heavy Weight champion and now a father and widower, straightens his son out, explaining him that there is no other person to blame in our misfortune than ourselves, and learning that is an important step for maturity. What makes the line so powerful is how impacting it is for us, viewers. We, like Rocky Jr., used to point our fingers on people held responsible for our failures, and after watching ""Rocky Balboa"", we understand it's time to reconsider this attitude.And this is the defining element of ""Rocky Balboa"", it touches us personally and invites us to identify with ""Rocky"" with the same level of empathy as in the first movie. The atmosphere conveys the same feeling of melancholy and loneliness, something that made me realize that the choice of having Adrian dead was an 'intelligent plot device"", although I don't like using that word. Adrian died of 'woman cancer' -an expression, Rocky would use- and left Rocky alone, with his son, with Paulie, and a bunch of memories. Rocky's life is behind him, he now runs a restaurant where he hired his first opponent Spider Rico, and he entertains the clients telling him the stories of his victories, and while we listen to him, we remember what a great character, Rocky is, in all the meanings of the word. From Spider Rico to Rocky's memories, the film is a rediscovery of a lost universe in a mood full of nostalgia.There's indeed a sad and dark feeling all through the first act, and Paulie plays an important part in the film, notably through his powerful (even Oscar-worthy) breakdowns that gives him a new level of three-dimensionality when he finally realizes how selfish and careless he used to be. The movie's sadness is so present that some might find it manipulative in the way it tries to inspire tears and make us feel sorry for ""Rocky"", but the movie doesn't fall in that trap, and takes an interesting turn to the future, when Rocky meets the famous 'Little Mary'. While not the highlight of the film, and thankfully not an excuse for a forced romantic subplot, 'Little Mary' is the outsider element that prevents both Rocky and ""Rocky"" to be alienated in its own universe, and a reminder that there's more in life than sad memories. There's also a good amount of humor, from Rocky's poignant slowness and good old Grump Paulie (am I the only one who thought his reference to 3D images as cartoons was hilarious) ""Rocky Balboa"" is the perfect conclusion of the series, something that was begging to be made after the disastrous ""Rocky V"", but I guess it was only a matter of time before Sly would find the right tone and right story to justify a sequel, something that would work as both a tribute and a continuation. Consequently, it took 16 years of pounds and maturity gains, and so many cinematic flops that could have almost ruined Sly's career and reputation. And this is another aspect of the 'rainbow' speech that makes it so powerful, it also works on a self-reflexive way, it's not just Rocky talking for his son or for us, viewers, it's Stallone's response to all the crap and all meanness he received in his life, to all these Razzies nominations that elected him as the scapegoat of 'bad cinema', to all the mockeries and incessant comparisons with Arnie, Stallone took all the hits and moved forward with a last provocation, a movie with a sixty-year old ""Rocky"" and managed to make it believable his challenge against the young Mason 'the Line' Dixon, less flamboyant but more realistic than any other Rocky's opponents.And to understand the reasons of this insistence, one has to take into consideration the scene when he expresses his desire to join the Boxing League, explaining that no one should interfere with his personal vision of happiness; this is again, Sylvester Stallone speaking for himself, for why he did ""Rocky Balboa"". The film's script is powerful as it works on many levels than even on its own, ""Rocky Balboa"" is a powerful and inspiring drama that should have garnered more Oscar nominations. No need to show it as a sequel, no need for a 'VI' number, the film is about the man, about Rocky Balboa and his ultimate quest before a last farewell to the ring, and for us, a last and real goodbye to Rocky, Paulie, Duke, the trainer, and whatever defined one of the greatest Saga of cinema's history, as illustrated by the ending credits that show the film's greatest heritage, the 'Rocky steps' as the incarnation of the spirit that raises us above our condition, the idea of going the distance.And I've always said that the ""Rocky"" films despite their flaws, always redeemed themselves through great finales, the same can be said about the ""Rocky"" series, if we consider how great and fitting conclusion ""Rocky Balboa"" was.",Rocky Balboa
44,MLDinTN,Nothing new but decent story,6,13 May 2008,"This movie was just OK. It's a lot of the same ole thing so there is little suspense. Sly Stallone and his many plastic surgeries are back as boxer Rocky Balboa. Could his face be any more tighter? It really does look silly. But besides that, Rocky owns a restaurant, sees his son some, and strikes up a relationship with a new gal. He gets talked into going back into the ring and gets a match with the world heavyweight champ for a big pay day. We have all the training scenes just like from the other Rocky movies. And of course a very old Rocky gives the young champ a run for his money. Which, in the real world some 60 year old is not going to keep up with a 20 something. So, just suspend reality and the boxing match will be better.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing I would see again. OK, but I wouldn't recommend it.",Rocky Balboa
45,ericstevenson,We're back to the franchise!,8,18 January 2017,"It seems like around the 2006 to 2008 period, there was a time where people kept making sequels to films that hadn't had a new entry in a decade in a half or so. These include ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"", ""Live Free Or Die Hard"", ""Rambo"" and this movie. It had been literally sixteen years since the last ""Rocky"" movie, which had a reputation as the worst in the entire series. Well, it would certainly take a long time for such a beloved franchise to get back on its feet and it did so with flying colors. It isn't as good as the later masterpiece ""Creed"", but this is definitely a good movie. I am happy to say I have now seen every single Rocky movie! People have been joking about a sixth Rocky movie for a long time. I don't know if the movie even began production before everyone said there would be another one. Whatever the idea, this is a fine film and while not one of the top two films, it's certainly worth looking at. I admit to being a bit confused by the beginning of the film. They didn't seem to get the plot going until halfway through it. Now this wasn't really a downside. We do get some good scenes that show Rocky just fitting in with everyday life. I like how they didn't try to update the character. Okay, they kinda did, with how they showed a CGI fight simulation.Yeah, that was kind of lame, but it does seem to be thought of that way in universe so that's a plus. This has everything you'd want in a Rocky movie. It's a huge risk making a new movie over a decade old, but here, it really did work. We got our training montages, our call backs to the previous movies and a nice fight in the climax. It was weird watching the other films and noticing how they slowly got worse with each installment. Here it gets better than ever, well until ""Creed"" that is. Thank you for taking a movie idea many people regarded as just a joke and making something good out of it. ***",Rocky Balboa
46,lesleyharris30,"The Finale Rocky Deserved,",8,25 April 2014,"Rocky Balboa is a great movie with a very well written plot and a terrific cast. This movie was a very pleasing finale to the Rocky series, I would honestly say it's the best of them, other than the original, taking Rocky on an emotional journey as he prepares to re-enter the boxing ring. However, I did find the relationship between Rocky and his son, Robert, to be poorly developed, it was never made very clear why there is tension between them, but this is barely portrayed anyway as a result of poor chemistry between Stallone and Ventimiglia. The majority of the cast shine, particularly Sylvester Stallone and Burt Young, who had not played these roles in years, yet watching them in this is as if they had never stopped. Rocky Balboa is a great end to the Rocky franchise and fans of the previous films with definitely be pleased.The famous boxer comes out of retirement to take on the current heavyweight champion.Best Performance: Sylvester Stallone / Worst Performance: Milo Ventimiglia",Rocky Balboa
47,secondtake,"A winning movie. All foam-core and bright lights, but who cares?",7,2 March 2010,"Rocky Balboa (2006)A friend made the point that you could see the first Rocky movie and this one, the last, and that's all you need. The truth in that is you get to the core Rocky values about life in those films. The middle ones are so steroidal and glitzy, and so obviously cashing in on the first one, you don't get anywhere with the characters.Well, I'm not 100% in on that, but it's a great start. The plasticky legend that Rocky is (and a legend he is, as the final credits prove) is amplified by the broad stereotypes of all the movies, and the race wars and the cold wars are just fodder for the Rocky machine to plow through, with earthy (urban) dignity and pithy comments that are true. But simple.Which is fine. This ain't no study of Philadelphia boxing culture, or of the American psyche, or of Italian American reality since 1970 (though it suggests all of these). It's just a great, loud, touching, believable, unbelievable story, well done, fast, gruesome, and winning. I still love the first one for being first, and for seeming as brave as its characters, this last one has those best qualities repeated (sometimes literally) and it works. It's like seeing the first one without having to literally see it. The 2006 Rocky is too obviously derivative (on its sleeve) to really be more than another cashing in. But it is very well done (including some rather sophisticated, artsy montage sequences near the end). And it touches on those things in all us all that make us want to win, to overcome the odds, to run up those steps, even as we get old and people start to really doubt us.Totally fun.",Rocky Balboa
48,A_Different_Drummer,secret to this movie,7,28 February 2016,"If you are a film buff you know for example that Bogey did a number of films especially late in his career which, while not exactly Maltese Falcon, were nonetheless solid and entertaining.So that is the key to this film. Understand that Stallone, who I think will be idolized by viewers of the future, does not know the meaning of the word quit. The oddsmakers said Rocky would stop at the second. When the 4th came out and was rock-solid (!) Hollywood was stunned.Rocky 5 was a bit of a lemon but again Stallone never quits.If you have seen all the Rocky films and they are still fresh in your mind, then his film will be a treat.If you on the other hand are not a fan, or just arrived from another planet, then what you have is a well-told and well-acted drama that builds into a pretty good boxing film.Either way you win.",Rocky Balboa

I thought, after 16 years since the last Rocky movie, this will be just another cheap attempt to squeeze more money out of the ancient franchise, but I was wrong.

52,slightlymad22,Stallone lands another knockout in the final round for Rocky Balboa,10,29 August 2014,"As we all know, Hollywood loves comebacks. And boy was ""Rocky Balboa"" Sylvester Stallone's comeback! Without this movie, The Expendables Franchise would not have happened, as (much like The Italian Stallion after a beating by Clubber Lang in Rocky 3) Stallone was down and out as far as Hollywood was concerned. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Burt Young, Tony Burton, Geraldine Hughes and Milo Ventimiglia and Henry G Sanders are all great, only Antonio Tarvner as Rocky's opponent Mason Dixon is a weak link.As for Stallone, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years (Rambo and Cobra) but it is Rocky Balboa that is by far his most popular role. Not because of how tough he is, but because of his heart. When he is playing Rocky, Stallone does something different with his eyes, and you can see in to his soul, you feel his pain and share his pride, joy and triumph. By some he'll never be considered a good dramatic actor, merely dismissed as a good action star, his early career was filled with potential and promise. Lords of Flatbush, FIST, Paradise Alley and Nighthawks and of course his Oscar nominated performance in the first Rocky showed a fine dramatic actor at work, then he produced the goods again in Copland. But it seemed audiences only wanted to see him in action roles (where his biggest success outside the Rocky franchise came from) as all these movies sadly failed to find an audienceI think those movies are some of his best work. One can't help but wonder what other wonderful films we may have missed out on as Stallone catered to what the fans wanted, sequels and action movies, before audiences deserted him""Get Carter"" totally tanked, ""D-Tox"" only grossed $6 million, ""Driven"" fared better but still only grossed $32 million against a $72 million budget. ""Shade"" only had a limited theatrical release and only grossed $459,098 at the Box Office whilst ""Avenging Angelo"" only made $824,597 before Spy Kids 3 gave his career a shot in the armAfter Rocky V's failure at the Box Office, reviving Rocky was not the safe bet it once was. In fact Stallone had to fight to get this movie made. And it pays off big time, this is on par with the original for me.Rocky Balboa is a highly professional piece of work, swift with a good sense of pace and atmosphere. Add in the score it makes for perfect entertainment.",Rocky Balboa
53,redryan64,"Return of Working Class Hero!! (Rocky better in Watch Cap, Gray Sweats & Converse Gym Shoes!! )",9,10 January 2007,"It seemed that we had truly at last come to the end of the 'ROCKY SAGA' with the release of Rocky V. Who would bring the series up to the high level of Box Office Apeal and ,yes, Cinematic Artistry.Well we were wrong! Stallone went to the well just once more and succeeded in breathing some new life into the series by going back to the basics. In the story's opening, we find Mr. Balboa is back in the old neighborhood, running a restaurant (looked like a pretty nice place, no greasy spoon or hash house it!) The bar/cabaret bore the name 'Adrian', after Rock's wife. We also find out that she has passed on, leaving a huge gap in both Mr. Balboa's life and that of their son.Rocky finds that he misses the sweet science and slowly gets re-involved in training and, after some very typical Stallone/Rocky musical interlude training montages, we arrive at the point of a big fight, this time being billed as an ""exhibition"". The fight was a natural for what locale? Why it would be great in Las Vegas, of course.As in all of the Rocky series, the fight scenes are first rate and truly exciting, especially when they're viewed with a good sized, theatre audience. Director Stallone gives touch of extra authenticity by having the bout covered by real fight announcing personnel and by framing the the visuals by real HBO TV screen titles.Real life former Champ, Mike Tyson is on hand for some trash talking with the new Champ. The total effect is that of being a feast for the senses, visually and in the original incidental music.All of what has been described up to now is mainly what we all expected in a Rocky film. What is it that elevated this installment of the saga above the previous episodes? Maybe Sly has developed a new perspective on life, both Rocky's and his own. He seemed to approach the screenplay with both a rejuvenated attitude and a respect and affection for the early days of the story.It may be the return of characters from the early days such as now all grown up Neighborhood girl Marie, and old opponent Spider Ricco and Apollo Creed's old Trainer Tony that provide us with a link to the original concept of Mr. Balboa as a true man of many contradictions. He was a club fighter and a collector for local juice loan man Garza (the late Mr. Joe Spinnell). He was at once brutally crude and yet he was a picture of innocence.No doubt that screen writer Stallone's ability to paint us a picture that is realistic enough, yet providing us with enough laughs via his subplot incidents and a good handle on some comic relief. I mean what other author could have pulled off such a literary pun as naming the new (fictional) undisputed World's Heavyweight Champ 'Mason ""the Line"" Dixon'.Sly says that this is the end of the line the Italian Stallion. If so, it's great that he's going bout on top of his game.! But on the other hand,if Mr. Stallone returns to the well just one more time, well.......... who knows?",Rocky Balboa

55,leplatypus,French pun : « Rocky bats le boa » (Screen),7,4 February 2007,"If movies are fiction, franchise have (sometimes) a real factor: the passing of times of characters & the audience. So, in the last part, the characters ponders about life, past, old memories. As the audience faces the same issues, the interest grows.With the Rocky franchise, the answers is rather optimistic because Rocky is a winner, in his sport & in his family life.Now, his son has grown up & he delivers him a sublime speech about courage. Its simplicity beats more intellectual sentences from philosophers: ""life punches you: thus, you must learn to take them & then, you go on"" Not bad from a boxer..His wife (AAdriaNNN !!!) is dead. He is very faithful to her memory & starts a new romance with a lot of shyness & gentleness. Very unexpected from a boxer! And this is a great relationship because they really help each other. I didn't know the actress, so it is a fine newcomer! His town, Philadelphia, is getting older. He spends his time in his old streets, running after his past. I know how he felt because I do the same in Paris, feeling throat squeezes when I walk in streets where I used to spend times with a lost dear friend.Finally, regarding to the boxing, the story is rather a good surprise: first, the fight is tastily directed & its issue isn't what I have thought: Hearing Stallone saying that he wanted a better final than ""Rocky V"" & audience crying, I expected Rocky to die. But, he doesn't & the paradox is interesting: he loses the game but still feels happy!!! This ending is thus the perfect final point to his humanist message.In conclusion, Rocky offers a good lesson of life. What it lacks on sport, it gains in heart, so it was a very enjoyable movie. It was already the thematic in the beginning: What afraid me is that my motivation was this last chance to watch a ""Rocky"" on a big screen, and when I was in the theater, I realized that I have seen part five, and maybe part four also. Time is catching me",Rocky Balboa
56,TheMovieDiorama,"Rocky Balboa, much like the titular character, throws tired punches within the constraints of its clichéd boxing ring.",5,7 November 2019,"Thirty years since Rocky, the underdog from Philadelphia, graciously climbed into the ring and gave Apollo Creed a run for his money. Then a sequel was commissioned. And another one. And another. Until the negligently produced 'Rocky V' was released with its disappointing conclusion, leaving fans underwhelmed. Stallone too, discontent with the final product. Thus, the sixth title in the series was conceived, with Stallone starring, writing and directing the feature. Throughout the sequels, many tropes were repeatedly utilised to capitalise on the resounding success of the original instalment, after all it received the Best Picture award of '76. The training montage to ""Gonna Fly Now"", the awkward conversational exchanges between Rocky and a potential love interest, the old optimistic monologue and Stallone attempting to demonstrate he isn't just a masterpiece wax work by shedding one tear. All culminating into an emotional boxing match where it doesn't matter who wins, ""it's about how many hits you can take, and still keep moving forward"".The narrative difference in all these thirty years? Rocky is older now. Fine, that was somewhat harsh. Stallone implements some note-worthy additions to the linear storytelling. The brooding aura of melancholy that envelops Rocky and Philadelphia, struggling to move on from the passing of his wife Adrian. This sorrowful force restraining Balboa to a mere relic within the sport that he fought so viciously in. Guests visiting his restaurant (aptly names ""Adrian's"") to intently listen to his tales, as if a museum piece for all to reminisce. Struggling to retain his symbolic status within boxing.The problem is, Stallone never progresses the plot. In fact, he maintained the narrative to be a simple yet dull nostalgia trip that relied heavily on sentimentality. A wearisome derivative of the original that, unfortunately, felt fatigued in terms of homaging certain plot points. The entire first act was Balboa moping around, despite Adrian passing years ago, embodying remorse. Stallone, as Rocky, nailed the consistency of his character. From the awkward dialogue to his emphatic mannerisms, he constantly reminded us that he is the only actor available to play this legendary cinematic character. Whilst Stallone's performance was commendable, others not so much.There's an underlying issue with insufficient chemistry between the actors. Stallone and Hughes, reprising the character of Marie, were decent if undercooked. Stallone and Ventimiglia on the other hand, who portrays his son, had nothing. All dialogue exchanges between them felt forced and lacked emotionality, particularly when Ventimiglia was ""supporting"" his father outside the ring. Young was passable as Paulie, although acting talent has diminished considerably over the years with his constant shouting.The third act boxing match was filmed concisely, with Stallone taking a distant approach in order to exploit the energy within the room. The corny punching sound effects were removed, with Stallone and Tarver actually throwing real punches. It certainly exhumed realism, if a tad pedestrian. However, Stallone then opted to embed unusual visualised effects within the fight to indicate Rocky's thought process as he remembers past fights in search for vigour. Far too cheesy and cumbersome, breaking up the flow of the match with unnecessary slow motion. Rocky's opponent Mason Dixon was severely underdeveloped, lacking strength within his motives as he yearns to be taken seriously as a heavyweight champion.Rocky Balboa will entertain fans of the franchise. It encompasses several vital narrative elements that many have learned to adore. However, for the casual audience who are neither here nor there regarding the series, it's a drained formulaic story that depends too heavily on paying homage to its predecessors. Ultimately exhausting itself before the penultimate fight commences.",Rocky Balboa

59,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Let's start building some hurting bombs!""",8,11 December 2008,"Another Rocky movie is definitely a long shot, to say the least. Stallone came out with a new Rocky movie and a new Rambo movie pretty close to each other, so it's pretty easy to assume that he's having career trouble and desperate for a couple of new hits. I haven't seen the new Rambo yet, but I just watched Rocky Balboa and it was much better than I expected. I remember one scene in Rocky III where a newscaster said something like ""A comeback for Balboa at age 34 is a longshot indeed,"" and that was more than two decades ago!Adrian has died of cancer and Rocky has become a restaurant owner, still loved and respected throughout his community by pretty much everyone except for the people who are immediate and stunning a$$holes to him. What was the deal with that teenage girl berating him at the bar at the beginning? Are there really teenagers who act like that? And why didn't the bartender swiftly boot her and her clearly underage friends out into the street where they belong?Clearly, this was an attempt to show how times have changed, from that foul-mouthed little girl in the first movie who Rocky walked home and gave his famous pep-talk to (and who, by the way, is now the bartender), and into these clownish teenagers. Sad, how the times have changed.Even sadder, the changing times don't stop at the teens. The neighborhood is falling apart, all the old places that we have come to know and love from the first five movies are all dilapidated wrecks, and Rocky takes a few reminiscent strolls through the neighborhood, remembering fond memories.The whole beginning of the movie is pretty sappy, but the movie becomes interesting (and strikingly predictable) when we meet the new Heavyweight Champion of the World, which himself must also be a suggestion of how times have changed for the worse.The Heavyweight champions used to be enormous fighting machines, guys of unbelievable size who are carved out of wood and represent truly formidable and intimidating opponents.So what is the deal with this Mason ""The Line"" Dixon? Antonio Tarver is a real life light heavyweight fighter with a highly impressive record, but he does not for one second look like a world heavyweight champion. I knew guys on the junior varsity football team at my high school who looked more like heavyweight champions than this guy. He may be a good fighter, but he's just not a heavyweight champion, especially not a movie champion.At any rate, you know those guys who sit around those noisy TV studios talking about sports after the game? I always thought those were some of the goofiest guys on TV (they're like frat boys in fancy suits), but soon they start talking about how the undefeated Dixon has been spoon-fed all of his opponents, and that back in the old days Rocky fought much tougher, harder fights.You may remember this form of media taunting as the major catalyst that drove Rocky II, but this time around they have the technology to actually computer generate a theoretical fight between Rocky, in his prime, and Dixon. Rocky scores a pretty decisive win and Dixon, of course, is unimpressed.Soon begins Dixon's expected taunts and demands to fight Rocky, who is sort of dragged into the whole thing unwillingly. There is also the issue of his son, who has grown into an older version of the disrespectful little punk that he was in part 5. He has some uppity office job and is striving for respect among his colleagues and superiors, but can't ever seem to get it because of who his father is. Needless to say, he's not so enthusiastic about this new fight with Dixon, because no one takes Rocky even the tiniest bit seriously in the run-up to the fight.Paulie is still around and still his old, lovable self. At one point he walks into Rocky's restaurant and Marie (the little girl from the first movie who was a bartender in this one until she lost her job and started working for Rocky) asked him if he has a reservation, and he responds, ""Do I look like a freakin' Indian?"" At least some things haven't changed!Despite Mason Dixon never for a second looking like a professional boxer, they did do a good job of making him an arrogant, immediately dislikable character. He's an egotistic, pompous jerkoff, and when juxtaposed with Rocky's ever-present charm, it's impossible not to know how the movie is going to end.Still, I won't give it away. The important thing is that this is a respectable addition to the Rocky saga, and I think a successful and satisfactory conclusion to the series. Rocky is clearly getting to be an old man by now, but they do a good job of making us believe that he still has enough left in him for one more fight. And best of all, the very last line in the movie proves that he has still done it for all the right reasons",Rocky Balboa

You got to see Rocky dig in and be inspiring again... and that is why we all love Rocky stories isn't it? Rovky V lacked the inspiration, Rocky Balboa came back with full force and it has continued though Creed, and, hopefully, when I get around to watching it, it will be there in Creed II as well.The magic is that it comes back to the Rocky I and II dynamic, where it's not just about boxing, it's about Rocky and his story. And that is what we all missed in III and IV, and was attempted but failed miserably in V.It felt like an early Rocky film, it felt like both an end and a rebirth of the franchise, and it was a very satisfying film to watch... especially given didn't really pull the punch we were all dreading and hit us full force.",Rocky Balboa
63,freemantle_uk,Rocky ends on a high,8,23 May 2008,"Rocky V ended on a bittersweet note, with the hero of the franchise ending up bankrupt and forced to retire from boxing. He ends up becoming a trainer and manager but gets betrayed by his young boxer Tommy Gunn. Many Rocky fans and Stallone himself didn't like that film. They was also the factor that Stallone's career had been on a downward spiral and there is a trend at the moment were 80s franchises are being reawaken, such as Terminator, Die Hard and Indiana Jones. I personally think Rocky V was a decent film.In this film Rocky is in his late 50s, his wife had died a few years before hand, his relationship with his son is strain because he has to live in the shadow of his famous father. Rocky owns a restaurant in downtown Philadelphia and lives on his past glories. At the same time Mason Dixon, the world heavy-weight champion, is very unpopular and struggling to find an opponent. On ESPN a virtual boxing match was done between Rocky in his prime and Mason, which 'surprise surprise' Rocky wins. There is debate on what would happen if that fight really did happen and Rocky decides to come out of retirement. Mason's management team offer Rocky the chance to fight Mason in a charity expedition fight in Las Vegas. You get the fun of seeing Rocky do his training regime and how a man his age would train and fight a boxing match like him. In the fight itself Rocky surprises everyone by giving the audience a epic 10 round boxing fight.The film's story is far-fetched, but the audience who is going to watch this is going to know this already. It has Rocky back as an underdog and shows him as a sad and lonely man. He ends up forming a bond with lil' Marie from the first movie and takes her son under his wing. The fight scenes themselves were very well done and you see how Rocky would fight it. It was done like you would have seen it on HBO. Stallone also looks very muscular for a man his age.Rocky Baloba is a fitting end to the franchise and a good fun film. Great to hear the theme tune for one last time.",Rocky Balboa
64,dfranzen70,"Not enough fighting, too sappy",5,24 March 2007,"I was all prepared to buy into this new Rocky movie. I was ready, because it'd been 16 years since the last one, a movie Stallone himself said was kind of the worst of the bunch. Yeah, kind of. I was ready for Rock to come back against all odds and persevere, beating some rip-snortin' champeen of the world to reclaim his dignity. But although this sixth Rocky film has most of the elements that a winning sports movie will have (underdog story, friends/relatives who don't want him to do it, theme song), the result is flat, coming to life only during the requisite big fight at the end of the movie.It's been a long time since Rocky fought Tommy Morrison. Since then, wife Adrian has died and son Robert is now all grown up working at some highfalutin job. I can't remember what the job was, but it was some kind of white-collar Important job, the better to juxtapose it with Rocky's self-made lifestyle. But Paulie (But Young) is still around and, as it turns out, so is Duke (Tony Burton), who's been Rocky's cut man in all of the films thus far. But wait, with no Adrian there must be some kind of romance, right? Someone who can push Rocky a little, make him really want to succeed? So enter bartender Marie (Geraldine Hughes), who's from Rocky's old Philly neighborhood and has a son of her own. Sure, the son's a teen who looks more like a twentysomething, and he's a tall, gangly dude instead of an adorable waif, but you takes what you can gets.Anyway, at this point in his life Rocky's settled down. He has a restaurant, at which he spends a lot of time reminiscing and schmoozing with boxing fans. Trouble is, Rocky lives in the past. Several times we see him visiting Adrian's grave or standing in front of old gyms or bars or other haunts, just trying to soak in some of what used to be. If there was an Olympics for wistfulness, ol' Rock would surely win the gold each time out. He's had much success, and yet here he is, living in the past. Paulie's not of the same mind - he asks Rocky to change the channel, stop living backwards, and any other cliché he can come up with.Meanwhile, the current champeen of the world is one Mason Dixon, who's something like 35 and 0 with 33 knock outs. The slam on him is that he's not really fighting anyone of any caliber - he's just beating up bums. Sort of the same knock against Mike Tyson back in the day (Tyson even shows up in a ringside cameo), and Dixon gets roundly booed at his bouts. Then a computer simulation is run pitting Dixon against an in-his-prime Balboa. When the results give the edge to Rocky, brother, it is ON! Promoters figure here's their change - people hate Dixon and aren't coming to his fights, so taking on a sentimental fave like Rocky in an exhibition should spike sales.So after some deliberation, Rocky decides to go for it, because that's what Rocky would do. His son, who's had to spend his life in the wide shadow of his father, is wholly against the idea, but naturally he comes around in time. Paulie's against it to, sort of, and even so, he notes he can't really help Rocky train, what with his job and all. But fret not, because that plot complication is handled easily enough, too.I'd almost be able to forgive Stallone (who also wrote and directed) for the exponential schmaltz factor if there'd been more actual boxing, but the final battle with Dixon is it. There are no prelim bouts, no fights to get Rocky in shape, nothing. So he basically moves from the gym to the ring for his big fight. In reality, if he pulled that crap in his fifties, he'd be splattered by Dixon within one minute of round one. I won't tell you precisely how it ends, to preserve that air of mystery, but I'll note that the ending adds nothing different to the massive oeuvre of sports movies. Seriously, if you can't figure out how this one'll end, you've probably never watched a movie before.About the only time the movie's worth caring about is that final fight, though, because it's pretty well done. Fight of the century, even. A lot of traded blows; it's well orchestrated without being unbelievable. I mean, it's not as if Rock is bleeding profusely from the eyes, mouth, nose, and neck and still manages to land a lucky punch to win it all at the last second. That would be stupid. But really, that's the shred of credibility to which this movie clings.Most egregiously, we don't get to hear the awesome, iconic theme song in its entirety until the movie's mostly over. On the other hand, a movie without the screeching ineptitude of Talia Shire can't be too awful.Hopefully, this will bury the ghost of Rocky Balboa for good. It's not a terrible way to go out, but it's by no means a knockout.",Rocky Balboa
65,PWNYCNY,There's a little bit of Paulie in all of us.,9,17 January 2007,"Amazingly, this is a very good movie. Rocky comes out of retirement to fight one more time. But more importantly, the movie is about dealing with change, with loss, with the irretrievable passing of time and how life goes on, no matter what happens. Rocky is more than a fighter, he is now a philosopher who observes life and the people in it. The young girl from the past is now a grown woman. The young boy who was his son is now a grown man. But despite the passage of time, Rocky is still Rocky. He is the Tevya the Milkman of Philadelphia. This movie is about not giving up, always moving forward and never looking back. And let's not forget Paulie played by Burt Young. Mr. Young offers a fabulous performance as Rocky's suffering yet indefatigable brother-in-law Paulie. Paulie is the every-man, the average Joe, the guy in the crowd who in this movie is heard. In a way, this movie is about you and me because there's a little bit of Paulie in all of us.",Rocky Balboa
66,ackstasis,"""But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!""",7,22 February 2007,"""Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"" For the final time, the cries of thousands of fans ring across the stadium, cheering in unison for their hero, their champion, the greatest of all time. Rocky Balboa stands proudly under the flashing lights, triumphantly raising his hand, almost crying with emotion. Whether or not he actually wins the final fight is totally irrelevant. He has won. As he did in the original 1976 Best Picture-winning film that made us cheer his name, Rocky may not have been the victor, but he has earned the right to be proud of himself, winning our admiration along the way.One could be forgiven for being a bit wary of a fifth 'Rocky' sequel, released a solid 16 years after the previous installment, and pitting a 59-year-old Sylvester Stallone (at the time of shooting) against a world champion boxer in his prime. Is this just a vanity exercise for Stallone? Is it a final ditch-attempt at making money from an actor who has given us disappointingly little in the last decade? Thankfully, 'Rocky Balboa' is a lot more than this, and Stallone has given us one final reason to cheer for his hero, offering Rocky the perfect conclusion to his thirty-year saga.Devastated since the death of his beloved Adrian (Talia Shire) four years before, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) goes through the motions of his existence. He owns a modest Italian restaurant named ""Adrian's,"" and spends many of his nights chatting with his customers, regaling them with inspirational stories from his boxing days. His son, Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), is an intelligent young man in his twenties, though he feels as though he is constantly standing in his father's immense shadow. Rocky's grumpy brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young) stills hangs around, offering the occasional unhelpful observation and labeling anybody he doesn't like a ""bum.""The first chapter of the film is essentially a trip down memory lane, offering the audience a healthy and not unwelcome dose of nostalgia. On Adrian's anniversary, Rocky and Paulie take an annual tour of their old haunts from the original film, observing regrettably at how things change so quickly. In a quiet bar late at night, Rocky meets Marie (Geraldine Hughes), the little girl from the original 'Rocky' film, who notably told him, ""Screw you, Creepo!"" Now a grown, relatively poor woman with a son of her own, Mary appeals to Rocky's kindness, and he goes out of his way to help her whenever he can, offering her a job and his friendship. Whilst he may not be a smart man  when Marie informs him that her son's father was Jamaican, Rocky invariably deduces that this must be somewhere in Europe  he inarguably has a kind heart. Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote the script for the film, also proves once and for all that he is the king of writing lame jokes, but this all adds to the strange charm of Rocky's character. When offering Marie and her son, Steps, a card to his restaurant, Rocky declares, ""I'll leave it on the steps... Steps."" Yes, it's that bad. But we remember that Rocky never was too witty with the old jokes, anyway!Searching desperately for a means to achieve some self-satisfaction, Rocky decides to take up boxing once again, limiting himself to some low-key, local bouts. However, the managers for the current World Heavyweight champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), sense a lucrative business opportunity, and entice Rocky to participate in a Las Vegas exhibition fight. Mason himself is looking for some self-satisfaction. Though he is the undisputed champion and remains undefeated throughout his entire career, the caliber of his opponents has always been sub-par, and he knows it. Until he defeats somebody great, he will never be remembered as a champion. For the record, Mason doesn't initially consider Rocky to be great, expecting to dismiss him easily in the early rounds. Mason Dixon has obviously never seen a Rocky movie!The boxing match itself is quite a spectacle. The first two rounds are handled as though we are watching a real-life, live boxing match on the television (filmed in High Definition to accomplish this effect), complete with a time clock and expert commentary. For some of the later scenes, the action is handled more stylistically, using quick cuts and the occasional effective reversion to black-and-white, with the bright red blood streaming from Rocky's battered eye contrasted stunningly against his otherwise pale face. The fight result may disappoint those who are here simply to see Rocky win again, but, if anybody complains, they're quite obviously missing the point. Even if he didn't win the fight, Rocky can still count it as a victory. The underdog has, once more, won over a skeptical crowd, and proved himself to be worthy. This is also true for the man behind the character. Of Sylvester Stallone's film-making abilities, I am skeptical no more.",Rocky Balboa
67,dee.reid,Rocky Balboa for a new generation,10,25 March 2007,"In a time where almost everything coming out of Hollywood is either a remake or a sequel (both of which are completely unnecessary), it's great to finally see one that is actually worth the $20 I paid for the DVD - ""Rocky Balboa."" Sylvester Stallone stars, wrote, and directed 2006's ""Rocky Balboa"" (filling in for director John G. Avildsen), the sixth and (presumably) finally installment in the iconic ""Rocky"" series. Stallone has obviously aged and it shows, but at 60 he looks remarkably strong and ""Rocky Balboa"" proves that he still has a punch (and a mean left hook) still left in him, and that's the film's entire point: ""It ain't over 'til it's over."" The movie slowly but surely builds to an inevitable conclusion between Balboa and reigning heavyweight titleholder Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), a young fighter 30 years his junior. Along the way, though, ""Rocky Balboa"" wallows in self-pity, as our hero, up in his age, remembers the good 'ol days with Adrian (Talia Shire, in archive footage), who passed away years earlier from cancer, Rocky revisits many of his old haunts (which have since been demolished or are falling apart), he drags loyal friend Paulie (Burt Young) along on these re-visitations, young Marie (Geraldine Hughes) catches the fighter's heart, and his relationship with his son Robert Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) is strained because the young man is growing up in his father's shadow. What gets the story running along is that ESPN does a computer-simulated match between Balboa and Dixon, which forces Dixon to challenge the 60-year-old to a 10-round, nationally televised vengeance bout. So cue the inspirational music by Bill Conti: ""Rocky Balboa"" gets rip-roaring along. ""Rocky Balboa"" is very easily the best film in the series since the original ""Rocky"" (1976). Stallone is at his best; his best work since, surprise, the original ""Rocky."" ""Rocky Balboa"" may lack any significant originality, but it has heart, and that's all that matters. This is ""Rocky Balboa.""10/10",Rocky Balboa
68,meeza,Rocky solid!,8,9 April 2008,"The Rocky film series is one of the legendary film franchises in the history of cinema, whether you though they were knockouts or decided to throw in the towel after the second one. However, it does ring a bell that ""Rocky 5"" was definitely the lightweight one of the group. So what on earth would drive Sylvester Stallone to write, direct, and star in another Rocky film after ""Rocky 5"" was knocked out by critics and filmgoers? Well, probably because Sly is just a sly guy. Stallone's final chapter of the Rocky franchise ""Rocky Balboa"" is a hard-hitting narrative piece that revives the franchise back to glory. ""Rocky Balboa"" tracks down Rocky years after he retired and now owning an Italian restaurant in his hometown Philly. Rocky is now a widow (Adrian passed away from Cancer) and his son Robert Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) is a cerebral yuppie in his early 20's who thinks his dad took way too many shots to the head. The just mentioned concept definitely does come into fruition when geriatric Rocky decides to get back in the ring and fight heavyweight boxing champ Mason ""The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver). Many including Robert Jr. think that Rocky has undoubtedly crossed that Dixon line illegally and thoughtlessly. Rocky is just longing to prove that he has it in him to go round to round and pound for pound with the supreme fighters of the present generation. ""Rocky Balboa"" does punch away with various other subplots including a new fem friend for Rock, dealing with brother-in-law's Paulie (Burt Young) insecurities, and the melancholy power of solitude in being a widow. However, ""Rocky Balboa"" is primarily the story of a father who craves to prove to his son that he is a winner no matter how stubbornly the method of the madness. My scorecard shows that Stallone gets enough commendable points in his craftsmanship of ""Rocky Balboa"" to be unanimously selected as a fitting final chapter. OK, ""gonna fly now"" out of here! **** Good",Rocky Balboa
69,CubsandCulture,Really the only Rocky sequel to capture the tenor of the first film...great swan song,10,19 March 2019,"The 1st Rocky was as much, if not more so, a love story as a boxing story. Moreover, a lot of people forget in light of the sequels that Rocky's goal in the first film is to (merely) go the distance. He actually loses his big fight in the first film. This film is really the only other Rocky film to balance the boxing and the personal drama; this film is a love story as well and again it is almost more important than the boxing. Rocky's goal is a mirror image of the first film. Indeed the film rhythms with the 1st film the most of any sequel. The film is remarkable at capturing the original melancholy and salt of the earth vibe of the first film. And it does this despite the plot being absurd. It is far better than it has any right to be.Stallone gives one of his best performances ever in this film. The twilight Rocky is even more poignant than the younger Rocky and there is just something utterly correct about the use of nostalgia in his performance. Rocky Jr. is also wonderfully fleshed out and given some depth. In all honesty this film should be watched instead of Rocky V as it is far better ending of the original slate of films.The big fight at the end is both more subdued (realistic?) than it normally is and also more stylish. I rather liked the choice to film parts of the big fight in black/white with splashes of color. It is a bold choice and gives this film a fairly different flavor from the other Rocky films.The Creed films are amazing in their own right but this film is the fitting end of Rocky's story, even if there are other stories that have Rocky in them.Great film.",Rocky Balboa

A computer game gets much media attention when a virtual Rocky beats the virtual champ and one thing leads to another.Still very much in fairytale land, but more relaxed and nuanced in its build up to the inevitable climactic fight where others have been a bit fraught - this is Rocky back on form for a last outing after the weak Rocky V.

The more life changes as time moves on the more Rocky gets the itch in his gut to lace them up again. A scenario is engineered for Rocky to fight a top fight bout while his son and others question his desire to box again. Rocky is quick to share his life lesson in passionate soliloquies during the movie and he still is very down home, humble and old school. Will Rocky land some more punishing bombs and show his usual grit and determination? Dumb question! This movie had really good lighting, shot framing and effective cinematic moments. Stallone can still entertain and energize. If you like the Rocky franchise, don't miss this one.",Rocky Balboa

Sylvester Stallone is a master whenever it comes to such movies and this movie being close to his heart he has kept his heart out.Direction and screenplay is good although gets little slow but will not disappoint you.

73,Cristi_Ciopron,Sly Stallone's swansong as an action star,6,2 April 2010,"In the mid—2000s Stallone made a couple of upgraded sequels to the vehicles of the two franchises which brought him fame and recognition and stardom. These upgraded sequels, his swansong as an action star and physical actor, are both movies a bit more thoughtful and nicely shot and all in all something like an advance and a fit way to end those franchises; I have been more impressed with that grimmer 4th Rambo than with this 6th Rocky (perhaps I have always tended to like the Rambo movies, save the atrociously emetic third installment, more?), but they're both fine, worth watching movies.I'm a '90s kid, I grew up in the '90s with flicks like those of these two franchises; and Stallone has been my favorite of the action's trio. So it was a joy to watch this 2006 installment of Rocky, written, directed and played by Sly himself; a bit of an unnecessary supplement to a tired franchise which already had nothing worth saving. The cinematography is pleasing, the characters are a bit deeper (though as a rule the Rocky flicks are more conventional than the Rambo ones), Sly even utters some bitter aphorisms about how the world crushes people (talking to his depressed son), and on the negative side the script seems rather loose, with plot lines going nowhere (Sly's girlfriend and her son ), while the boxing part looks a bit added or glued, with no connection to the bittersweet family drama which preceded it. So I believe that ROCKY BALBOA is a badly written movie, heading nowhere, a bit pointless, if you take my meaning. The script is also a bit self—indulging.",Rocky Balboa

I groaned again. Then I saw it, and by reel 2 even I was shaking my head, smiling and won over; this film is genuinely terrific. If Horrorwood must revisit a dead duck, I guess this is the way to do it. The congrats must go to Stallone who wrote and directed, and gave himself genuinely funny asides and small charming character moments all through. In a recent local interview in Australia (he visited) he happily agreed with the interviewer that he should NOT make another RAMBO franchise (mooted) and announced he should finish on a proper respectable high and let ROCKY BALBOA be it.

78,aharmas,The man is a legend,10,25 December 2006,"There is probably not a single surprise here. The film works because we have the underdog trying to show the younger man that there is still fire left in him, and Balboa embodies every single quality that makes a hero likable. He is suffering because he is alone and tries to find his way back into the hearts of many by doing what he thinks is right, and the film leaves little doubt that he is a good old' boy.""Rocky Balboa"" is pretty satisfying because it comes during the holidays, and it exudes sympathy and compassion for the less fortunate. It also carries along some sweet humor and some pretty good fight scenes, the boxing continues to be important to the film, but it's not the heart of the story. It is interesting to see how technology has been updated so that the presentation might have a little more impact now than in the original, and somehow it remains as fresh as ever.I must admit that the emotions feel genuine, and it's not difficult to get caught up in the excitement and the chanting of the people who call their hero's name during the climatic encounter. It's also rousing to see how Mr. Balboa still has enough heart in him to climb those steps and do a few push ups.There are mentions of all the important characters in the originals, and Talia remains an essential part of what made the original so special.

It's certainly NOT a documentary-you just know no way a 60 year old boxer can face someone like Tarver for 10 hard-hitting rounds-but they put it over anyways just because. This is Rockyworld, stuff like that Can happen-there.Stallone should do more semi-character roles like this. Come on he was good in this, Rocky is just fits like an old glove for him or that battered hat. There were some flaws here-I thought Paulie was weak, I thought they banked on nostalgia too much, and you never really get to know Steps or his son all that well-but still....It works just fine. You buy the new romance and you buy the fact he needed to do this to exorcise his demons.

81,Movie-ManDan,The Long Awaited Sequel The World Was Satisfied With.,10,24 January 2015,"The sports genre in movies would not be in existence if Rocky was not made in 1976. Since then, it has spawned five sequels with its fifth and final being the one people seem to love the most. It also marks the 30th anniversary since the first Rocky movie, and features the most parallels to it too.None of the Rocky sequels have nearly received the amount of acclaim as the first, but Rocky Balboa is the one that comes the closest. Thats what kind of bothers me. This is not significantly better than any of them. The only thing that really stands out (aside from the nostalgia and Rocky's old age) is the motivational speeches that are delivered. But those aren't enough to say that the movie as a whole was lots better than the others. I don't know what it is, but if I had to pick a favourite, it would be the very first. Other than that, the sequels are all equal in greatness and in flaws. Rocky Balboa takes us back to to the early years by having a darker, dreary tone that the first two had. Rocky still lives in the poor part of Philly (explained why in Rocky V) and owns a restaurant named after his late wife, Adrian. I don't know why Talia Shire chose not to partake in this. She would have been just as good as ever. Rocky and best friend, Paulie look around Philly and reminisce about the old times, with flashbacks being shown. That's very nice to see. When a computer simulator on ESPN makes Rocky defeat current world champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, Rocky sees it as a chance to step out of retirement and prove that he is still as good as he once was.The only flaws I found was the subplot where Rocky reconnects with a teenager from his past named Marie. I found that subplot to be weak. Then there was the final fight between Rocky and Dixon, which I also found to be the weakest fight in the series. Other than that, Rocky Balboa is just as nice as the others.Sylvester Stallone wanted to do this back in 1999, but there were many production delays. Truth is, he hated Rocky V and wanted to do Rocky Balboa as an apology flick. I can see why he would be unsatisfied with his performance--he makes Rocky out to be retarded--but why the whole movie? But I will admit, the inspirational portion has not been this good since Rocky II. Overall, I am glad that there is a Rocky sequel the world loved. I just wish people loved the sequels just as much.",Rocky Balboa
82,ExplorerDS6789,"Rocky Balboa vs. Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. The Italian Stallion's Ultimate, Mind-blowing Comeback, You Know!",9,29 December 2006,"Life in Philly was going great for Rocky Balboa, though he lost his beloved Adrian four long years ago. He was still mourning her death, which left a big, gaping void in his life. He's long retired from the ring and has opened a restaurant named, respectively, ""Adrian's"". On occasion, his good friend Paulie would drop in and have a drink. His old former opponent Spider Rico works as a waiter. Rocky was still a respected celebrity around town and everywhere he went, he got the praise and respect he deserved, which was putting pressure on his full-grown, exec son Rocky Jr., but fame is bittersweet, for at his old neighborhood tavern, he was heckled by some rowdy barflies. That's also where he ran into a girl he had once known, Marie, or Lil' Marie as she was once called. Rocky had taken her under his wing long ago and pointed her on the right path, and her way of thanking him was saying, ""Screw you, creepo"". Now, Marie was grown and had a son, Steps. Rocky took Steps under his wing and gave him a job as a busboy. He also let him name his new dog: Punchy; Meanwhile in the world of boxing, the undefeated Heavyweight Champion of the World, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, was not looked upon as a hero in the sport, but rather a poster boy. The media felt his fights were unjust. They even held a computer simulated match to see the outcome of a boxer of the present battling a boxer from the past. The current match pitted Dixon against Rocky Balboa. Balboa won. The media was all over it, praising Rocky and jeering Dixon.Rocky continued to see Marie and offered her a job as hostess at his restaurant, while Paulie continued to gripe about every little thing that bothered him, namely everything. He still worked at the meat plant where Rocky used to box (punch) the meat. It wasn't the greatest job in the world, but to Paulie, it was his whole life; Dixon's people wanted to make the match with Rocky Balboa a reality. It would be a sinch. A 33-year-old undefeated champ versus a 60-year-old has-been. Should be a piece of cake, right? We shall see. Rocky was interested in fighting again. He wanted to prove to the world he could still be a champ. He could still achieve greatness and be somebody. So, with Rocky Jr., Marie, and recently unemployed Paulie at his side, he went to train with Duke, the man who had trained Rocky's former opponent turned friend, the late Apollo Creed. In spite of Rocky's arthritis and calcium deposits on his joints, he was still able to train most vigorously. He lifted every weight in the place, he jogged through the snowy park with Punchy, he ran up and down those famous steps. Push-ups, sit-ups, crunches, quad thrusts, bench pressing...after many strenuous days of training, the Italian Stallion was ready to make a comeback.The exhibition match, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon vs. Rocky Balboa was on. It took place at the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino in fabulous Las Vegas. After being out of the ring for 20 years, does the Stallion still have what it takes? Round 1, Dixon had the advantage, pounding and pummeling Rocky, but he quickly bounced back and laid into Dixon over the next few rounds, then it was anybody's fight. Dixon proved to be one mean fighter. The toughest contender yet. By the tenth and final round, it was anybody's fight. Rocky and Dixon both bore many scars and bruises, their faces decorated in blood and sweat. Dixon delivered a swift and vigorous blow to Rocky's face, sending the Italian Stallion down momentarily. His whole life flashed before his eyes. That's when he thought about his son, and about Adrian, which gave him strength. He bounced back once again and pounded Dixon. Dixon countered. Rocky struck back. Before long, the fight was over. Both opponents still standing. The judges were at a split decision over the winner. Marie, Rocky Jr., Duke and Paulie rushed into the ring to congratulate their hero. And even though Rocky didn't technically win the fight, he still proved once and for all that he was the greatest fighter of them all. He proved that it isn't about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. And the only kind of respect that matters is self respect.Rocky Balboa, or Rocky VI. The long awaited Rocky VI. I saw it and thought it was very good. As good as the first five Rockys. This one bears many similarities to the first Rocky, such as the outcome of the fight, Rocky's turtles Cuff and Link make a comeback, and we meet some old friends like Marie and Spider Rico. Mason Dixon seemed exactly like a young Apollo Creed. But one thing that bothered me, what happened to Marie's son? He seemed to just disappear. He wasn't at the fight. They just seemed to get rid of him; Sylvester Stallone shines once again as the Italian Stallion, proving that despite his age, he can still pack an awesome punch. Burt Young is back as the Paul-meister. Tony Burton returns as Duke. Antonio Tarver is Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, Geraldine Hughes is Marie, and Milo Ventimiglia is Rocky Jr. all turned in terrific performances. Rocky fans will notice Talia Shire's absence. Adrian died in 2002 of ""woman cancer"". Rocky's running out of friends. First Mickey, then Apollo, now Adrian. Watch out, Paulie! Anyway, if you've seen Rocky I-V, then by all means see Rocky Balboa, or Rocky VI. After 16 long years, the Stallion is back in action. It's definitely worth seeing! I doubt there will be a Rocky VII. Maybe for that one, Sly will wait until he's 70. But in the meantime, see Rocky I-V, and then see Rocky Balboa! Yo Adrian, he did again!!",Rocky Balboa
83,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The better of several prior sequels and the right way to complete a saga,7,26 July 2015,"Sylvester Stallone like every Hollywood star has had their ups and downs in their careers. However throughout their career, Stallone is probably one of a small group of actors who have channeled their personal experiences into their own filmmaking. As many fans of the original Rocky (1976) know, the story of a down-on-his-luck boxer being given a chance of glory was taken directly from Stallone's own life. It was because of this parallel that Stallone was able to relate to his character and act so well. As time went on, every sequel after the original became influenced by Stallone's personal experiences. With that, the Rocky (1976) franchise has had mostly decent writing for every entry. Even with Rocky V (1990) being the weakest of the series, it still had parts of its writing that were intriguing. Thankfully with the failure of Rocky V (1990) this touching entry may not have been conceived at all. Apparently Stallone was disappointed enough with the outcome of Rocky V (1990) that it made him want to correct that mistake with one more entry and boy did he.Credited as actor/writer/director Sylvester Stallone has proved once again that he can manage these tasks simultaneously (of course given the right material to work with). Several years after Rocky V (1990), fans pickup with a now older Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), a widower and the owner of local Southern Philly restaurant named Adrian's. When a boxing simulation is played publicly of who would win between then-Rocky and current heavyweight boxing champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), Dixon's managers convince him it would make a good career boost to make this a reality. Rocky on the other hand has things to consider. Stallone's writing feels much closer to the first two films than it ever has before; it is very character driven. Rocky is still the fuzzy teddy bear he was 30 years ago and continues to enjoy talking to people and telling stories. He still hangs with Paulie (Burt Young), who still works at the original meat factory and reminisce the days of Adrian (Talia Shire's role) in various throwback settings. This is by far the greatest tribute to any of the characters in the Rocky series, it is truly touching.That's just the tip of the iceberg. There's loads of development for several characters. Paulie, who usually has nothing great to say until the very end has a key moment with Rocky that shows his soft side. Milo Ventimiglia plays Robert (Rocky's son) and has his own issues to confront with living in his dad's shadow when the time came and it is handled appropriately with deep impact. Rocky also happens to run into a grownup Marie (Geraldine Hughes) from his past (in the original film) and son Steps (James Francis Kelly III). Marie too provides supporting dialog that is rich in texture and meaning when Rocky begins doubting himself in what he wanted to do. And although he could've been utilized far more than he was in final cut, long time training buddy Duke (Tony Burton) has one of the best pep-talks audiences will hear in years. It's great to see that man back, he is a dedicated man that shows he's still got a kick left in him.Along with that are numerous references to the older films. That means whether it is minor characters, landmarks or flashbacks. There's always something for the fans of the original to look back on and remember with nostalgia. There may be references that even the most adamant of the series may not catch because of how subtle they are. When it came to the sports aspect of the film, it was well represented. Apparently not only did Stallone and Tarver physically share their faces with their fists but they also kept the actual sounds as well. The actual amount of boxing isn't that abundant but it does payoff when the third act comes into play. Even so, with the amount of writing included to develop the characters properly, the boxing match is just the icing on the cake. The realism to this sports match was turned way up for this entry.Coinciding with the realism is cinematographer Clark Mathis' work. Initially, the execution plays like a regular film but as the running time continues the camera-work changes from that of movie to realistic PPV camera-work. All of which is credible and well done except for one scene. This scene is when Rocky is explaining himself to the boxing board for him to have a boxing license. What Rocky says is moving but is clearly distracted by a shaky cam. Why - hard to say. Sure what's being viewed looks more realistic but it's distracting from what audiences should be hearing of what Rocky's saying. Other than that it's fine. Bill Conti returns again for the music to this popular series but he didn't compose much of anything new. That's probably the only disappointment. Sure, his music is recognizable by now and all he really did was cut and paste his old tracks to emote the feelings for each scene (which work great by the way), but that's not what should be expected. It's not like it's being asked that Bill Conti change the Rocky theme or other memorable motifs but there's always room for additions. It just feels lazy even though he did a great job mixing and editing his tracks.The whole experience is gratifying in its own sense just to see how Rocky has changed over the years and what he's had to deal with. Even with competent camera-work that becomes randomly obnoxious at one point and memorable music that is recycled that clearly could have had additions, the final installment to the Rocky saga is a heartwarming closure due to its character driven writing and sports realism.",Rocky Balboa
84,Sandcooler,"""Don't you think you're a bit too...old?""",4,16 July 2011,"Okay, it took me six entries, but now I'm finally ready to say it: I don't buy it anymore. Somehow I hoped my suspension of disbelief would stay intact while watching this movie, but it was a vain hope. A 60-year-old Rocky fighting the reigning heavyweight champion just because he believes in it (cue forty minutes worth of corny dialogues), it's just pretty insulting to the audience's intelligence. Even ""Rocky IV"" was more believable, I suppose that says it all. Furthermore, Stallone is obviously on steroids for the occasion, which kinda ruins Rocky's mystique. The actual boxing is only ten minutes of the movie though, it mainly focuses on the drama aspect (a back to basics approach, if you will). The problem with that is that they already tried it in ""Rocky V"", only here it's somehow even less interesting. Adrian is immediately killed of, Paulie is even more of a heartless jerk than usual, and the new characters add absolutely nothing. I still don't get what the use of the Steps character was, he bonds with Rocky and then just sorta disappears halfway in. I just didn't like this conclusion, I liked it even less than ""Rocky V"". Disappointing to say the least.",Rocky Balboa
85,Matt_Layden,"""Balboa Is Like Remembering The Past With Old Friends""",7,27 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa owns a restaurant called Adrians, named after his wife who has passed away. Rocky is old now and lives his life telling old boxing stories to his customers. His son has the unfortunate task of living in his shadow, as everywhere Rocky goes people want his autograph. A computer puts a match between Rocky and Mason, the current undefeated heavyweight champion. This match gets people talking and encourages Rocky to come out of retirement for one last time.Rocky Balboa is has many good things going for it, but it just doesn't have that one spark that the rest of the series has. For one, it isn't the best film in the series, for the other it's a perfect ending to the series and for the Rocky character. Rocky Balboa is a film that takes us back, back to that era when people were chanting that name and running up those stairs. The film feels like your sitting down with a bunch of friends and recounting the fun times you've had and places you've went. We know and love the character and it's sad to see him where he is today, with all his glory in the past. Much like the fun memories that we have, that are in the past.Balboa feels more gritty and real then the previous films, it has that Million Dollar Baby feel. A little too real if you ask me. The climatic fight scene is short and no where near as suspenseful as one would hope for. Rocky is indeed old and past his prime, this is evident in the fight. Rocky doesn't take a beating and he doesn't give a beating either. The Rocky films were set in an obtuse reality. The fight scenes were so obvious that they would never happen in reality, one only has to watch Rocky fight Drago to know this. But that is what made the films good. The tension is all gone in the final fight because everything happens slowly and it's over sooner then one would think.Balboa packs the most emotion since the original Rocky film. The film isn't really about boxing, or overcoming great odds, but more of Rocky's life after his success. Whereas the fifth film failed at this, Balboa succeeds with great strides. People will like this movie because it has the exact same feeling as the original. Films 2 through 5 had Rocky at the height of his fame. He was in his prime, had the title shot and has the belt. Now, much like the original where he was no one, Rocky is too old and is considered a joke in the eye of the media.Fans of the series will not be disappointed. Much like the title character, its audience has also grown older. We are right there with Rocky remembering the good old days with Adrian. Stallone is indeed getting older and it is more evident here then ever before. He was never really a good actor, but here he manages to show some talent. Burt Young gives a good humour supporting role. Although, Everyone else attached seems to be lost. The films so called villain, Mason Dixon, is no where near any other opponent Rocky has faced. With the likes of Apollo Creed, Thunderlips, Clubberlang, Ivan Drago, hell even Tommy Gun, Dixon is the worst. The character has no qualities about him that make him stand out at all. Again, this can only be counted for the ""reality"" that this film is set in. If you want to see a Rocky film with a Million Dollar Baby undertone, Rocky Balboa is the film you want to see. If you walk in expecting unrealistic fights, vibrant colours and over the top villains, Rocky Balboa will disappoint.The series was getting tiring and almost dead, Balboa is the perfect ending to it, because it has that same feeling, but at the same time manages to inject some life. Balboa features the classic training scenes and theme song and will give you goose bumps like the old days. Rocky and Stallone have finally let that beast out from within. Stallone can now feel content that the series has a proper ending and if you're the kind of person with an emotional heart, you may even shed a tear. I recommend Balboa for those who want one last match with the 'Italian Stallion'.",Rocky Balboa
86,gangstahippie,Great finale to a great series,8,26 December 2006,"Rated PG for Violence and Some Language.I wouldn't say I am a very big fan of the Rocky series but I enjoyed the Rocky films very much.Rocky 1 and 2 were very dramatic and had good plots.Rocky 3 and 4 had enough action to satisfy.Rocky 5 wasn't too great but Balboa makes up for it.Rocky Balboa concentrates more on drama just like Rocky 1 and 2.Rocky is now a retired boxer.His wife has died and he owns a deli named after her.He has a peaceful life.One day a sports show on TV shows a computer fight between Rocky Balboa and the new boxing champion Mason Dixon.It shows Rocky winning and some boxing promoters ask Mason Dixon to fight Balboa just for show.So Balboa gets into the ring despite everyone thinking that he would embarrass himself.He trains and fights.I will not spoil the ending but you should be pleased.I enjoyed Rocky Balboa.It sort of exceeded my expectations.I expected it to be better than Rocky 5 and it was way better.It was also better than Rocky 4.Still not as good as 1,2 and 3 though.Balboa is worth theatre price or a rental on DVD in my opinion.",Rocky Balboa

88,denis888,"Poor, bombastic, pathetic and funny",2,19 May 2007,"Mr. Stallone has proved in the billionth time that he is not in vain one of the biggest Golden Razzie holders as The All-Time Worst Actor of The Century. I really feel pity for all those who enjoyed this insipid and inept horror of a movie. Sly is very weak as a director, he is incredibly poor as a script writer and he is a very bad actor. I mean, everything is so predictable and not fresh here. You want a family tragedy with a cancer victim and a son who stays away? Here you are! You need a bad proud boxer who needs a good lesson? Here he is. You want a gut-wrenching, jaw-dropping, dull and impossibly boring dialog lines? Here they are!

89,MartianOctocretr5,Don't try this at home,7,1 June 2008,"OK, so many movies are offered up as pure escapist fantasy. But, come on; it took real chutzpah to come up with this one. The underdog getting his big chance to prove himself motif played out well and captured our imaginations 30 years ago when the long shot Italian Stalion stood tall, but this time the dice seem so hopelessly loaded against Rocky that not even a divine miracle could help him. Some things are too much of a stretch. It's easier to believe aliens are blowing up the world, or dinosaurs have been cloned and are hunting us, or Dorothy killed the witch than to swallow a story that 50-something Rocky, back to mumbling incoherently in a Philly neighborhood with that same beat up hat he used to wear, steps out of retirement as a result of a ""computer simulated match"" between him (in his prime) and the current heavyweight champ, and has a prayer of winning in a (ready?) sanctioned bout. That's like expecting an electric golf cart to win the Indy 500 or Tom Cruise to win an acting Oscar.Accept it as unbridled fantasy and there's actually a pretty good story here, with interesting human conflict, heartfelt emotion, interesting drama, and fine acting. It should be noted many bits and pieces of the original Rocky are thrown into the mix, and are very obvious, almost as if you were being challenged to spot as many as possible. Just one of the many examples: In the original, Creed chides former champion Joe Frazier. Now Dixon chides former champion Mike Tyson. The only difference is that since so many of Rocky's inner circle of friends have been killed off over the course of his career, the recognizably rehashed lines will be spoken by new characters.However, Stallone still has it, and so does his alter ego Rocky. As outlandish as the premise is, as much of its content has been used before, it still entertains. Leave any sense of reality at the door, and this movie is worth a watch.",Rocky Balboa
90,DJAkin,The best ROCKY since #1!!!,9,1 January 2007,"This is such a great boxing movie. As a die hard fan of boxing, this movie delivered all the goods on a great scale. Today is new years day and no better movie could could I have chosen. The movie had a lot of Rocky walking through Philadelphia remembering Adrienne and Mickey. He kept seeing their images. A lot of it was about him talking about how he fought Apollo Creed (who makes a great Cameo in the final scene). There was also a great montage of Rocky training with beer kegs and cannonballs. If there was ever a great fight scene, it was between Rocky and Mason Dixon. That put the Cubber Lang fight TO SHAME. It was neat to see in the audience, Tommy Gunn, Ivan Drago, Apollo Creed and Clubber Lang as spectators. The scene with Mike Tyson was a throw away shot. All in all, I would say SEE THIS MOVIE IF IT IS THE ONLY MOVIE YOU SEE THIS YEAR!!!!",Rocky Balboa
91,MR_Heraclius,Rocky,8,13 February 2020,"Stallone goes the distance in the final installment of this underdog saga. Rocky Balboa is simple, plain, boxing entertainment and drama with modern-day fight experiences that fully surpasses its past films (except 1 & 2). The film is a graceful presentation of past, present and future in the realms of boxing and life and does enough to save the franchise until the final bell.",Rocky Balboa
92,Howlin Wolf,You'd expect nothing less from Rocky Balboa than to go out fighting...,9,28 January 2008,"... and that's exactly what Stallone delivers in his series swansong. If any keen observer were to read my ""Rocky V"" review, they'd see that I was less than enthusiastic about the prospect of yet another round. Well pay attention, because here's another one for the record books: I have never been so happy to admit that I was wrong! This final showdown is a triumph, and has just as much genuine emotion about it as the first one did, way back in 1976. It's proof that courage and tenacity don't desert a person, when they get older.Some people complain that the whole idea is just a bit too corny, and in reply I want to continue my theme of drawing back parallels to the initial outing. To the naysayers I answer that the first one was built on the cliché of 'small town boy makes good' - ""His whole life was a million-to-one shot!"", etc; it doesn't make that one or even this recent one any less invigorating, as far as I'm concerned.I loved the relaxed pace, it puts the emphasis back on character development, exactly like the first one. The later sequels - whilst entertaining enough - sometimes fell into the trap of being too flashy and shallow. The original quality that was supposed to make Rocky stand out was his heart, and we weren't allowed to see enough of that after he first started out. This one places the utmost importance in the guts and determination of Rocky Balboa.If you relate to the 'underdog' Rocky - the one who stays loyal to his neighbourhood and glories in familiar surroundings, then I can't see how you wouldn't like this. If all you're after is trophies and 'one-man-can-change-the-world' hoopla, then that isn't here. It's been rightfully divested. Let's face it, one man can't change the world, all they can do is try to give the best possible account of themselves. I can think of no more fitting praise to dish out than to say that the sixth Rocky film achieves this ambition with complete aplomb.If Sly can resurrect one franchise so adroitly and with the absolute best of intentions, then I have to believe he can give ""Rambo"" the well-timed makeover that it requires, as well. You won't catch me making the same mistake twice. I guess I should know better than to ever count Stallone out.",Rocky Balboa
93,dunmore_ego,Rocky LX: Grandpa's Revenge,8,30 December 2006,"Something old: Stallone. Something new: *Rocky Balboa*. Something borrowed: *Rocky*'s script. Something blue: Talia Shire, excised from the story for dramatic impact and watching from the ropes as *Rocky Balboa* garners accolades as the best Rocky movie since *Rocky*.Whilst working in one mediocre/forgotten/unseen film after another, Sylvester Stallone must have champed at the bit watching the glut of sequels, prequels and freak-quels litter the Hollywood wasteland. So it was never a question of IF his dam buster icon, Rocky, would tread the canvas once more, but whether the excursion would be a worthwhile one or just another throwaway sequel adding to the dilution of Rocky's legacy. Thankfully, writer-director-star Stallone waited for the right time and the right script to make it worthwhile.Yes, it's about resurrecting a staple source of income, mining a well long thought run dry  but there's nothing wrong with that if it is done this compellingly. The problem with franchises revisiting their roots is that they neglect the very elements that earned them their laurels, going ""Hollywood"" to chase the wider demographics and the easy cash. Stallone has gone the way of the darker prequels and pared-down sequels, in giving us an earthy, gritty final chapter in the Rocky legacy, which makes for a sturdy bookend to the series.Bringing to mind two recent revampings, viewing *Rocky Balboa* is like watching *Batman Begins* (a grittier character study of a well-worn icon, using latest filmic techniques), but with the content of *Superman Returns* (the script for the first movie in the series dusted off and sold as original).The opening lines unashamedly foreshadow the plot, as we see current World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (real-life light heavyweight champion, Antonio Tarver) in a television broadcast, being criticized as winning against losers in uninspiring matches (mayhaps a commentary on the state of boxing today?), commentator opining that boxing is ""looking for a warrior to thrill us with his passion."" Cue Rocky's saddened Philadelphia existence, wife Adrian having died five years ago, the Italian Stallion now eking out a living managing a reasonably popular Italian restaurant called ""Adrian's"" (with Mexican cooks  most definitely a commentary on the workforce of today).In yet another snide commentary  on the virtual world of the iPod and eFluenced generation  the plot is jogged into training by a televised computer matchup pitting a former boxing champ, Rocky, with the current champ, Dixon, Rocky's pixels knocking out Dixon's pixels, which  like the soft-minded real world of today  causes untold media debate and street-side squabbles pertaining to the ""reality"" of the computer's decision.Meanwhile, Rocky (Stallone, doing his best acting since *Cop Land*, 1997), pushing 60 and experiencing the mid-life crisis most of us go through at 40, points to his stomach and confesses to Pauly (Burt Young, as acerbic as ever) that he's ""still got some junk in the basement."" (I imagine the ""basement"" would be lower than the abdominal area, but I suppose it wouldn't read as well if he said, ""Yo, Pauly. I've still got some junk in my mezzanine."") Whatever the metaphor, we gather that Rocky wants to taste his own blood again as it spurts from his gashed brow ridges and broken teeth. Just local matches, he asserts. But fate will once more trip him into the spotlight, as Dixon's managers, with cash signs in their eyes, cajole Rocky into an exhibition match on the strength of the public outcry of the computer matchup.Cue - The Montage. Add Bill Conti's fanfare. Add beefcake. Serve hot. Enjoy. Admit it - every time you hear those blaring horns you make a promise to yourself to lose some pounds via one-handed push-ups.*Rocky Balboa*, like *Rocky*, is not about boxing. It's not about winning. Like *Rocky*, it's about heart. So no matter the improbability of a geezer going up against a freight train, it's not about the outcome. It's about ""going the distance."" And Stallone surely looks to be in the shape to do it. Even if Stallone himself could never stand up to a real life champion half his age, it surely looks like Rocky *could*.Dixon is also given a compelling reason to enter this match which will make him a loser whether he wins or loses the bout. (He wins - he beat up an old man; he loses - an old man beat him up.) An old trainer tells him, ""Pride is what brought you here. Losing it is what brought you back."" He may be a winner in the ring - but a loser when it comes to pride. He is not made out to be too shallow or villainous, which is credit on Stallone's part, whose controlled directorial and writing style in this film evokes an Eastwood-ian self-composure.Admittedly, the manipulation is saved for the final act, most obviously with *Gotta Fly Now* and then surprisingly, filmed entirely like a HBO pay-per-view sports event, with god-angles galore, which speaks derogatory volumes about our current sensibilities  meaning, real-life modern sports events have adopted the glam and slam of a Rocky movie, so filming this Rocky segment as if it was a real life event is an ironic case of art imitating life, which imitated art in the first place. The final fight scene also pays homage to Frank Miller's sterling *Sin City* (2005) with certain shots in black and white with snatches of startling color.Dare I state the outcome? If you've seen *Rocky*, you'll know the ending. And Rocky/Stallone makes it clear that this will be Rocky's swansong, ""I've gotten rid of the Beast."" The end credits feature shots of people running up the famous stairs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, putting a capper on the series, as we all realize, with a parting tear, that any more would definitely be parody.No more junk in the mezzanine.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",Rocky Balboa
94,chrichtonsworld,Solid drama,7,1 April 2007,"When I heard ""Rocky Balboa"" was going to be made I was a bit skeptical! I mean Sylvester Stallone is 61 if I am not mistaken! So how you could take the movie seriously! But after viewing it I must admit he did it again! This movie is just as good as the original! I don't know if this was done on purpose but excluding Adrian (Talia Shire) provides an extra edge in the drama! She is now death and Rocky still mourns for her! For the most part he is doing OK. He has his own restaurant and is generally happy! Only he has the feeling that he has some unfinished business concerning him and his son! The speech he gives to his son about succeeding in life was striking and excellent! I felt it and was motivated by this advice! Since the focus is more on the drama,the boxing match plays a secondary role! But still it is very exciting to see the old Sly fighting the young Antonio Tarver (who is a real boxer)! I hope Sly is finished with the Rocky series,because you can't get a better ending like this!",Rocky Balboa

So, I was quite unsure of how great this film would be.It works on a level, it gives the character a little closure from the last time we saw him... But the film, has kind of ran out of steam, small scenes like Rocky talking to Marie does not seem to hold the strength that it once did when Rocky tried to woo Adrian....But Rocky's banter with Paulie seems to still hold, and Balboa's jokes are a little old...but it puts a smile on your face.

96,antoniotierno,better than Rocky V but nothing special,6,15 January 2007,"It's not delightful but Rocky's fans - and I'm one of those - needed this farewell; the story is not so entertaining but is enjoyable on the whole, sticking to the original format that made the first flick a cult. Stallone is sentimental and rejects the spirit of Rocky V, an unlucky film, and the plot develops concepts like late-life crisis and sadness at growing. Silvester is far from being and acting like Marlon Brando but this time succeeds in being solid and not boring in spite of the pearls of wisdom tossed off. Could simply say that many things are new here and many others are eventually old but the innate power of Rocky is back, though not as shining as thirty years ago.",Rocky Balboa
97,baumer,This is the real deal! Rocky delivers big time!,10,21 December 2006,"WOW!! That is first word that comes to mind 12 hours after sitting down to watch the film. My expectations for the film were quite high after seeing the trailer and watching Stallone look like he recaptured some old magic. And he doesn't disappoint. This is a film that is on par with the first and second as per the story and the power that Rocky still has over us. I would dare to say that this is one of the best films of the year and if the academy had any original thinkers, then they would nominate this film for best screenplay. It is engrossing, uplifting and has its heart in the right place. This is the surprise of the year and if anyone has a soft spot for Rocky, this film will thrill you. It's makes you want to be a better man. And for that I wish I could thank Stallone for creating Rocky.The story is the strength of the film. Adrian has passed away and Rocky now lives a simple life. He runs a restaurant that bears his wife's name and he has all of his memorabilia on the walls. He even has a frequent visitor in Spider Rico, his first opponent in Rocky. Rocky makes a humble living and he regales his customers with old boxing stories and poses for pictures with his patrons. His son doesn't seem to come around too often and is going through a bit of a rough time trying to step out of his dad's shadow. Rocky misses Adrian but he also misses the ring. Every once in a while, you can see the ""beast"" inside of him. And he knows it too. But at his age, he knows his best days have past him by. But then, ESPN creates a computer program that pits the reigning champ against the old champ. And Balboa wins the computer fight. Because the current champ is relatively disliked for not having any heart, his handlers conjure up an idea to get Balboa in the ring for an exhibition. The idea is to build some love for the current champ by aligning him with a beloved one. The script is the best part of the film and Stallone develops all of his characters beautifully. This film is much more reminiscent of the first two than it is 3 and 4. It is also a film that makes you want to cheer. And that is a powerful thing.Sylvester Stallone knows Rocky Balboa. He created him after all. And he knows why we like him. He is a good man, he has a sense of humour and he is tough a nails. He spirit imbues what it means to never say die. It is a spirit than all of us can relate to and succumb to. This is a character who had it all, lost it all and still has a bit more to give. This isn't about winning, or even about losing, it's about ""how hard you get hit and yet still keep coming."" How can you not be inspired by words like that? Rocky Balboa is a movie that is not just a movie, it's about life. After the disappointing fifth film, it took a lot of guts to write another one and try to get the financing for it. Nice to see Irwin Winkler taking another chance on this one and it is going to pay off handsomely. I think World Wide this could do more than 150 million and it is already resonating with those that have seen it.This has the feel of the originals. It has Philly in the raw, Paulie is just as good as he ever was and there is even a nice subplot about an old neighbourhood girl, Little Marie, that Rocky helps out.The film loses half a point as the training sequences could have been longer and the fight could have been choreographed a bit better. I think there is a 2 hour version of the film out there that we'll see on DVD, but for the sake of maximizing the amount of showings, it has been trimmed down to 102 minutes. This doesn't take away from the power of the film however. It just keeps it from being perfect.One final note about Rocky. It is a bit of a personal one, but it perhaps transcends an individual opinion and might speak for many of us. Rocky is the ultimate character that so many of us can relate to. Most of us have something that is desperately trying to get out of us. And most of us don't know how to get it out. Rocky epitomizes that human spirit that exists in all of us. This film is a perfect example and a beacon of light for many of us. Like I said, this film makes you want to be a better person, and for that I'd like to thank Stallone for making 5 and 3/4 great Rocky films (Rocky V was great up until the last 15 minutes). They inspire me, and they make me want to find all that stuff in the basement and make it work for me. Corny? Perhaps. But true nonetheless. Thanks Sly.9.5/10",Rocky Balboa

He's still in good shape for his age, no longer trains rookie boxers, and currently owns his own restaurant.He still sees his son, Rocky Balboa Jr.(now 29) Only he has a decent desk job, and people keep referring to him as the offspring of Rocky.The current heavy weight champion is Mason Dixon, who isn't very famous in the world of boxing. On ESPN, they made a computer simulation fight in what would happen if Mason was up against Rocky. The computer simulator ended with Rocky as the champ. Mason was furious that he'd be beaten by the previous heavy weight champ. Half the experts say Rocky would have a winning with the other half doubt that Rocky could make a come back.After Rocky saw that on the TV at his restaurant, he put some thought on whether he should or shouldn't fight. Boxing has always his greatest past time in sports. And has 30 years of experience. So he decides to do one more match. He isn't planning to be on the top again, he just wants to do the very thing he's missed over the past several years. A lot of his friends and his own son don't think he's thinking straight about this decision. But all he's asking for is to show the world that the Italian Stallone is still a million to one shot. With support from his fans and friends, this will be a match to remember for the Italian Stallone.Before this movie came out, I was rather sick of people telling me that it'll flop because Rocky is a Senior Citizen in this one. But I had faith that this one will be good. And my bet won that it's as good as the original. The title makes it sound original rather than a sequel. Thing I like the most is it features 2 unimportant characters from the original as secondary characters. The original music is played quite a bit. And a lot of the scenes will remind you of the original that started it all. Those who disliked the previous one won't be disappointed with this one, as it has a better closure to the 30 year old saga. From the start to the climax, Rocky Balbao is indeed an inspiring movie on everyone's favorite Italian American.",Rocky Balboa
99,mentalcritic,"So help me, it is actually good...",8,21 July 2007,"When I heard that Sylvester Stallone was attempting to get a sixth film about the boxer character that made him a star made, I thought Stallone was out of his mind. In a way, it makes sense. Rambo aside, no other character Stallone has portrayed has really brought him the money, even when the respect was waning. Indeed, by the fourth film, Rocky had become such a farce that it obviously put a lot of financiers off the idea of paying for more. The fifth Rocky film was a transparent attempt to close the book on the character, and while it had a good story at its heart, the screenplay was desperately in need of a good polish. In some ways, however, Rocky reflects the man who created him, so a sixth film was almost inevitable. While it would have been all too tempting to go the path of Casino Royale and ignore all the embarrassing sequels, Rocky Balboa instead embraces its checkered past. While the references to previous sequels are subtle, the film does tie itself nicely together with the original, and is all the better for it.Rocky Balboa, like Rocky, is a very different beast from Rocky part two through five. In the original Rocky, the boxing match was a punctuation mark on a lengthy story about a man who is slowly warming up to the idea that he is more than his actual situation lets him think. The difference is in the details. However, Rocky Balboa takes a pretty preposterous idea and only does half a job of suspending the viewer's disbelief. Set in the modern world, Rocky finds himself stuck in the trap of looking back on his glory days and wishing his life could be like that again. Talia Shire's appearance in the film is literally reduced to flashbacks that depict her the way she was when Adrian and Rocky first met. The surprising thing, like all surprising things in Rocky Balboa, is that it works. The old neighborhood has become an even darker and dirtier place, with poverty rising to such an extent that buildings in minor disrepair at the time of the original Rocky have fallen apart to the extent of looking like a bomb literally hit them.I have to tip my hat to Milo Ventimiglia. The character he portrays is both very deep and yet thoroughly unlikeable for the first half of the film. He captures the sense of a young man who has lost his place in the world very thoroughly. For where Rocky might have captured the spirit of people living in the mid to late 1970s, Robert Balboa junior is a walking portrait of how the spirit has been sucked out of twenty-somethings after the year 2000. His story arc is a very subtle one, steered along by a very unsubtle man, but it is when Robert learns to fight his being stuck in a rut that the story picks up a few paces. Another great surprise in the film is Geraldine Hughes as Marie, the girl who had called Rocky ""creepo"" in the original. I must admit, it was jarring at first to see how the contrast between young Marie and middle-aged Marie was toned down, but it works beautifully. It seems the biggest lesson Sylvester learned in the twenty-seven years since Rocky II was that subtlety works.The device to get the titular former-champion back into the ring might be about as subtle as a nuclear strike on an outhouse, but it does work in its own way. Antonio Tarver's performance as Mason Dixon is as important to the film as Stallone's as Rocky. When we see him fighting a string of fights that fail to satisfy his audience, and wondering what he has to do to get respect, it evokes the situation boxing has been in since the 1990s. However, unlike the real-world boxers of these recent times, Mason is a sympathetic character. He simply wants to be able to look at himself in the mirror. The question is, however quickly, asked in the film's press conference of what he could possibly gain by fighting a man who is at least thirty years his senior. And I have to hand it to Stallone, the match at the end of the film answers the question in a way I never would have thought of. Rocky is there because he wants to have one last fight before he goes off into the good night, but Mason is there because he wants to prove that he can overcome a challenge.Helping matters is that Antonio is in fact a real boxer, and only the second real boxer to appear in the Rocky series. For where the fights in the other five Rocky films were transparently choreographed, Stallone chose to make what he promises is his final appearance as Rocky as authentic as possible. It works. So help me, I actually felt like getting up and throwing punches whilst watching the climactic match. But the real unsung hero of the series is Burt Young as Rocky's brother-in-law, Paulie. As Stallone points out in the audio commentary, Paulie's life situation reflects his way of living through it. Every insult and harsh word he says to others is reflected right back at him, and he just keeps going through it. Films that decide to rely upon a comedic sidekick could really learn a lot from watching Burt Young's performances throughout the Rocky series. Stallone might be the rock and the brain of the Rocky series, but Young was its heart most of the time. Both Young and Stallone could retire after this film and be proud of themselves.I gave Rocky Balboa an eight out of ten. Some of its plot threads do not work due to the editing, but this is easily the best Rocky since the first. It is a wonderful way to spend a hundred minutes.",Rocky Balboa
100,jaredmobarak,Fighters fightRocky Balboa,6,20 December 2006,"I never thought I'd hear the horns play the Rocky theme song again on the big screen. When I heard that Sylvester Stallone was bringing back the character that made his career, I couldn't help but laugh. After a great one to punch with the first two films in the saga, he hit a huge snag with the third, redeemed some respect with the fourth, and put a nail in the coffin with the fifth, (I try to forget that one was even made). One must wonder who thought there would be any interest in a new final chapter to the legendary underdog tale, let alone want to put up the money to back it. Although the new film, simply titled Rocky Balboa, is definitely not the best film by any means, it ends the story right, helps us forget Tommy Gunn, and, I'll admit, gets the blood going with feelings of nostalgia and a long forgotten hope buried deep down in our own basement.Stallone was a writer first and foremost. He saw a chance to break into the industry by writing a simple tale about a streetwise kid who turns his life around because of the desire to be true to himself. Young Rocky Balboa gets the girl, shows what he is made of, and wins the hearts of a nation. This script was picked up and Stallone was given the chance to bring his words to life. A phenomenon was born, and although he tried to do other things after, Sly was never going to be a great actor. The only way for him to succeed was to be himself and act the truest he could in the part that most closely mirrored who he really was. When we see Rocky on screen we are really looking into the eyes of the man who created the whole thing. Yes there were some snags, some really bad snags, along the way, but thankfully we have been given the opportunity to finish the arc the way we started it, with a quiet dignity and compassion for our hero.Rocky Balboa goes back to the roots of the first film and tells the story of a man who has no quit in him. This is not a fight film, but a character study about people who are looking deep inside themselves to find out who they truly are. Sure Rocky has pain inside him and a desire to let it all out, but the beauty of the first three quarters is in the small roles and how they are adjusting to life out of the limelight. Adrian has passed away, Paulie feels remorse for the past and a new found hobby of painting to deal with it, Rocky Jr is trying to cope with the shadow his father has cast on him, and Mason ""the Line"" Dixon is dealing with the glory of fame without the heart of a champion. Balboa is the glue that helps guide all these characters through the next month or so, to help them with their troubles and to finally lay rest the demons in his psyche. Stallone once again shows heart and skill in deftly portraying someone not much different than his real life persona. A lug through and through, Rocky always has a golden nugget of advice or an anecdotal speech to motivate. It's great to see Burt Young back as Paulie, everyone's favorite cantankerous uncle who can be menacing, (loved the meat plant worker almost running away from him in fear), and than lovingly humorous at the blink of an eye. Tony Burton's return as Duke is a nice addition too. Even Milo Ventimiglia brings a good performance to the table, as I have been disappointed with his acting in the show ""Heroes."" The resemblance in expressions and attitude to Stallone really helps make the relationship work. Geraldine Hughes adds some welcome heart to the mix as well.Unfortunately, while the beginning half of the film works nicely, both visually and script- wise, it's the final act or so that brings it down. For one, Antonio Tarver has no charisma on screen and looks uncomfortable throughout. There really is no malice setup for the guy and therefore no true villain to root against. Where, in the first film, Apollo Creed was also not an evil man to want to lose, he at least had a well-developed and acted character to add to the story and rivalry. Here, Mason Dixon is just a pawn cutout there to drive the plot. Also, the final fight sequence is badly directed. Stallone could have desperately used some help there to rein his vision. The dissolves and camera tricks are many and very distracting. Every change to black and white seemed to contain a close up of Rocky and always made me chuckle at how much it looked like the claymation Lipton Ice Tea commercials. When he tries to spice it up with flashes of color, mixed with the monotone, it just looks like a bad Gatorade spot. Despite everything though, I will say that I loved the get-in-shape montage, as no Rocky film can be made without one. The end doesn't get too sappy or campy as one would think, and the many parallels throughout the movie to the first Rocky adds to the nostalgic feel and the childlike glee in seeing the Italian Stallion go out for a final curtain call.",Rocky Balboa
101,fmarkland32,Final round...,7,22 December 2006,"Sylvester Stallone returns in his final go around as Rocky Balboa, this time Rocky is running a none-too shabby restaurant called ""Adrian's"", is widowed and overall living a lonely life. That is until a computerized fight sequence between Balboa and current champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, ends with Balboa winning, now with nothing to lose, Balboa risks it all to go the distance. I was really looking forward to Rocky Balboa in many ways (After I saw the trailer, at first I was cynical)and this movie delivered everything it promised. There are of course some flaws, such as some of the secondary characters are underwritten (I would've liked to see this go longer, believe it or not) and some of the subplots are either dropped or solved too quickly to truly pay off but once you see Rocky run up the steps and see Rocky make his entrance in the ring, it's nearly impossible not to smile. Another flaw is, I would've liked to see a longer training montage but overall this is a fitting finale and I for one was glad to have seen it. However I still prefer Rocky 1 and 3 over this particular chapter. Still I can't wait for the DVD release.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Rocky Balboa
102,adamscastlevania2,Sly ends the series right.,8,18 October 2014,"(73%) Everyone knows that Rocky 5 was way beyond the weakest of the series, even Stallone himself does, so he took a bit if a gamble and made one more to try and finish it off properly, and I'm glad to say that he did it better than most could have done. Any true fan of the series will find it hard not to to enjoy this, as well as getting more than a little lump in the throat whilst watching; particularly during the scene at the torn down ice rink. This really does book-end the series off the way it should, and Sly deserves full credit for going ahead with it as it rekindles some of the magic of the original sporting classic.",Rocky Balboa
103,jon.h.ochiai,Ageless Heart,10,21 December 2006,"""You're gonna show everyone that your heart is the last thing to age"" Now middle aged 'Skinny' Marie (Geraldine Hughes) says this to Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) the night before his fight with Heavyweight Champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver). Writer and Director Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky Balboa"" is all about heart and reclaiming one's own greatness. The true spirit and charm of Rocky emerges after 30 years in hibernation. I grew up with ""Rocky"". I remember as a kid being completely moved and inspired by ""Rocky"". Through the numerous sequels Stallone morphed into a cartoonish superhero defeating seemingly indestructible opponents out of sheer will. Lost was the sense of innocence and decency. Now 60 years old, Stallone returns to the simplicity of the character, and his story of Rocky again resonates with the soul. He demonstrates with his words that ""Rocky"" was not an accident, but an inspiration. Stallone also instills a sense of regret in his character, and that fire that still burns inside each of us as we grow older. In a moving scene with his estranged son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) he says: ""You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... how much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits. And not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!"" Stallone's words and his endearing character Rocky make ""Rocky Balboa"" touchingly poignant, bitter sweet, and inspiring. This lands with me, because I too am getting older, and in the words of Rocky, ""leaving more behind"" Stallone resurrects Rocky's quiet humanity lost somewhere in the flashier younger sinuous embodiment. Stallone also reminds us that he can be a powerful and compelling actor. As Rocky he has an amazing scene where he talks about his late wife Adrian to her brother Paulie (Burt Young), ""She didn't leave She died."" We catch up with Rocky, long retired from the ring. The love of his life, wife Adrian, has died of cancer a few years back. Rocky visits her grave every morning before working at his restaurant ""Adrian's"". Rock is the resident celebrity owner regaling patrons of his past ring exploits. His son Robert works for a large investment bank in Philadelphia. Their relationship is distant. Robert protests to his Dad, ""You cast a big shadow."" Rocky reunites with ""Skinny"" Marie (Geraldine Hughes). The widower Rocky strikes up a relationship with her and her son Step (good James Francis Kelly III). However, the peaceful life is about to change. An ESPN gaming simulation pitting Rocky Balboa, in his prime, against current undefeated Heavyweight Champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (former Light Heavyweight Champ Antonio Tarver), renders Rocky winner by knockout. Dixon is not amused. Reflecting the current state of the Heavyweight division, Dixon is a talented fighter with great quickness and power. However, he has no one to fight or challenge him. For Dixon there are no big paydays on the horizon. Unlike Rocky, the knock against Dixon is that he has no heart. So his management dreams up the scenario where Dixon fights Rocky in an exhibition. The catch is lure Rocky back into the ring.Rocky agrees. His son Robert questions his father whether this is about ego. It is not. Paulie gets that for Rocky, it's about getting his heart back and coming to terms with the loss of Adrian. In Rock's words it is about ""taking the hit"" and ""keep moving forward"". Of course there is the climactic fight with Rocky and 'The Line'. Applaud Stallone for making the characters so compelling, more so than the event. The fight itself is awesome, and Stallone looks amazing. At 60, he actually looks better physically than Tarver.The performances all resonate with an authenticity and comfort. Sylvester Stallone recaptures the enduring spirit, courage, and nobility in Rocky. Rocky may represent the very best in Stallone, and he gives his best here. There is such poignancy in seeing our hero coming to terms with his mortality and his life. Milo Ventimiglia is great as the young man, who begins to acknowledge the man his father is for him. At its core ""Rocky Balboa"" is about love and family. Geraldine Hughes provides a quiet strength as Marie. Antonio Tarver is impressive as Mason Dixon. His Dixon is not really the villain. Tarver is effective as Dixon learns that you don't demand respect, you give it first. Great seeing Burt Young as Paulie again. He is the movie's spiritual anchor. ""Rocky Balboa"" is about heart, love, family, and reclaimed greatness. ""Rocky Balboa"" is great.",Rocky Balboa
104,DarthBill,Can We FINALLY Say Goodbye To Rocky Now?,1,23 February 2008,"I really can't believe all the rave reviews this film has received, given that it's little more than a shameless vanity project trying to revive Stallone's glory days and not even doing a very good job of it. Yes, we all loved Rocky in the first film, and we loved him in the second film, but when we lost Mick in #3 and had to watch Rocky basically box for revenge in #4, something was lost along the way, and we started to forget how good the original was. This latest, pointless sequel will not help us remember that.The story - what little there is - goes something like this: 60 year old Rocky (Stallone) has lost his beloved wife Adrian (Talia Shire) to cancer, and his son (now played by Milo Ventimigula of ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""Heroes"" instead of Stallone's real life son, who was busy) won't talk to him because he's embarrassed at being stuck in his father's shadow, so Rock really only has Adrian's obnoxious brother Paulie (Burt Young) to keep him company. With his boxing days seemingly behind him, Rocky now runs his own restaurant, named in honor of his late wife, where he charms the customers with stories of his prime and seems to still be genuinely well liked by the good people of Philadelphia, who regard him as a personal hero. Later, he runs into a grown up version of Marie (the girl who said ""screw you"" to Rock in the first film when he tried to give her life advice), who is now a single mom, and they develop an almost borderline romantic bond, despite the fact that Rocky is old enough to be her father. After that, a cartoon character of a hot tempered boxer, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, and his management, and they create this big hoopla about which boxer of yore would have been a great match up for MD, and that turns out to be none other than Rocky, leading to promotions for ""Age Against The Rage"". Conveniently for them, Rocky once again gets that itch for ""one last fight..."" just to prove he can still go the distance. YAWN.What could have been a compelling and heart felt look at how a former champion moves on with his life when his glory days are gone turns into just another lame, ham fisted excuse to put Rocky in the ring. And while I admit it's impressive Stallone's in such great shape at his age, there's no way a 60+ year old man could duke it out with a boxer half his age.I can only hope that this truly is the last we see of Rocky Balboa, and that everyone from Stallone to the studios will FINALLY let this poor boxing lug rest in peace and let audiences, and cinema in general, move on.",Rocky Balboa
105,ivo-cobra8,It Ain't Over 'til It's Over - Third favorite best Rocky movie for me!,10,4 November 2015,"Rocky Balboa (2006) is truly the best Rocky Movie since Rocky III and IV, maybe the best of all time!! Still the first movie is the best, Rocky Balboa is close to the first film, the best movie in the series of all time! It is my second favorite best film In the series. I love this movie to death the same as I love Rocky I,III and IV to death! in my opinion it is better than new movie Creed! For me Rocky IV will be the best in the series. This movie brings closure to the ultimate sports movie. This movie showed the true essence of who Rocky was and what he was all about. The film has a heart unlike Rocky V who did not had a heart. The most that I love In this film is, the training sequence. The film is fast paced, entraining, not boring or over too long. It truly follows the roots from the first Rocky film, it is a 30.year anniversary after the success of the first Rocky film from the 70's. I love how Rocky meets little Marie (Geraldine Hughes) after 30.years and everything what Rocky predicted in the first film, really happened to her. Tony Duke (Tony Burton) did return in this film. There is no Adrian (Talia Shire) in this film, I am happy she wasn't in here. I heard something that Stallone did not cast her in the film, because she wanted much more money. Rocky, helped Marie and her son. He adopted little puppy and he run the stairs of his former statue. Running with his dog on the stairs was one the most touching sequences, I have ever saw! The speech he gives his son is probably one of the most inspiring speeches I've ever heard. This movie is Stallone's masterpiece, moving, touching, not boring unlike (II & V), Sylvester Stallone gave his best performance after the first film , I ever seen. The fighting sequences are realistic like in the first film! Antonio Tarver (Mason 'The Line' Dixon) wanted more money before he would agree to star in this film, so Sylvester Stallone gave half of his salary so that he did started in this film. Rocky Balboa (2006) was a huge impressive improvement over Rocky V. The fifth movie was the most sad film to the series I have ever saw. Even Sylvester Stallone him self was very disappointed with the flick, how it ended. I even heard they originally wanted to kill the Character Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone did not allowed that to happened with his character he invented. I am glad that he did come back after 16.years of disappointment to redeem him self and the most beloved character of the history! I have singly enjoyed this film, more than I did Rocky II, IV and V. People keeps saying Rocky V goes back to his roots well that would be Rocky Balboa not Rocky V. Rocky Balboa is going once back they way he was in Rocky I we see Little Marie after 30.years and everything what he predicted really happened to her. Rocky Balboa in this movie he has a heart we also see Spider Rico. Thank god there was no Adrian in this movie she annoyed the hell out of me. Sylvester Stallone made in my opinion one of the best movies and wonderful performance in my opinion. Rocky III, Rocky I and Rocky Balboa are in my top three best movies of Rocky that I absolutely love. After the huge disappointment in Rocky 5, Stallone has come back with a vengeance to complete this historic franchise. And he does it in style. The story is simple, but the characters are beautifully portrayed. I also heard that Stallone was planning to make this film in 2004 after a failure of Rocky V (1990) and he executed perfectly! ""It Ain't Over 'til It's Over""Thirty years after the ring of the first bell, Rocky Balboa comes out of retirement and dons his gloves for his final fight; against the reigning heavyweight champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon. That is your basic plot. I love this film to death, It is my second favorite best film of the series that I just love and Enjoy. I am giving it a 10/10, because the film deserves it. Rocky Balboa (also known as Rocky VI) is the sixth installment in the Rocky franchise, written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone, who reprises his role as the title character. The 2006 film in the Rocky series that began with the Academy Award-winning Rocky thirty years earlier in 1976.",Rocky Balboa
106,fernandoschiavi,"Rocky can finally rest in the memory of his admirers as the prodigal son of Philadelphia, finally returned to the glory he always deserved",8,3 October 2020,"16 years after the fifth film in the franchise that failed at the box office, Sylvester Stallone decided to resume the story to propose a closure to the narrative, while updating the franchise to the cinematic reality of the 21st century. Rocky Balboa is born out of a symmetrical desire to look at the past with regard to the plot, while aiming the future in terms of imagery construction.In the first minute of projection, ""Rocky Balboa"" highlights its nostalgic tone when highlighting the photo of Adrian beside the protagonist's bed, which, added to the melancholic version of the famous soundtrack by Bill Conti and the bluish photograph by J. Clark Mathis, transmits to the spectator the same feeling of sadness as the fighter. Living in a simple house in a humble neighborhood in the city, Rocky opens up the stark difference in reality between sportspeople from the past and the present when we compare their possessions with the mansion and luxury car of the current world champion. From then on, the eternal discussion existing in almost all sports takes place: past versus present. Questions like ""Who would be better? ""Or"" Who would win? ""They will never find a definitive answer, so the comparison between times is always a controversial and complicated issue. It is obvious that in a fight held in the present, a champion from the past would have no chance, but if both were at their peak, the winner could be another.Still in this context, ""Rocky Balboa"" takes the opportunity to address another interesting topic, first through a metaphor when Rocky goes to buy a dog together with Steps (James Francis Kelly III) and each character defends his point of view with some measure of reason. The fighter opts for the oldest and most experienced dog, going against the boy who preferred the youngest and full of vitality. In fact, even Steps serves to illustrate how we tend to judge by appearance, since he initially looks like a marginal, but in reality he is a good boy. The prejudice against old age arises again when journalists say Rocky would win an unlikely fight against Dixon and many respond that he is a broken old man or when Marie (Geraldine Hughes) refuses the invitation to be a restaurant receptionist because she understands that his appearance would not be good for his business.The general idea of Stallone's script may sound like a ridiculous idea, that Rocky return to the rings for a mere computer simulation, but the truth is that Rocky Balboa is one of the most complex and honest films in the franchise - without a doubt the best film directed by Stallone. The script is of an unforced melancholy, with the drama of a subject standing still and yearning to become relevant again, it is moving, without appealing to more forced resources: Bill Conti's subtle score is sure to take on the vibrant theme of ""Gonna Fly Now"" and reduce it to a slow piano melody that evolves - according to the narrative level - to the traditional music that we love to hear to inspire us.Rocky Balboa periods are quite different. The first half is quite sentimental, symbolic and nostalgic, and for that very reason, deeply praised by traditional film critics, while the second is dedicated to fans of the third and fourth episodes, with the fight full of adrenaline and testosterone, even if under a more cautious and reticent look, similar to the hero's already old condition. The praise for the initial part is fair, since the conduct that Stallone gives to his story is sensitive, simple and reverential to the character he created in the seventies. Rocky remains faithful to his own, accompanied by the same assistants who supported him during his victorious trajectory, but clearly he lacked something, a reason.The construction around the differentiation between Rocky and Paulie (Burt Young) makes up one of the most touching moments, when the typical redemption alluded to in Sly's films finally makes sense in a movement that doesn't sound mushy. Paulie declares that the memories involving the late Adrian are bad for him, because they bring up memories of the abuse he dedicated to his sister. Rocky Balboa is basically about the ghosts of the past and how hard it is to go on with life without the same spotlights, glories and adrenaline of the past, resulting in measured and punctual scenes about such internal conflicts. Also standing out in the aforementioned discussion between father and son, Milo Ventimiglia conveys Rocky Jr.'s bitterness for having the shadow of his father's fame always close by. Showing himself embarrassed to think that Rocky's shadow prevents him from evolving on his own, the boy can't even react when friends watch his father's virtual fight in a bar, smiling awkwardly as everyone cheers and talks to him. Finally, it is worth mentioning the good participation of Burt Young, who, once again living the grumpy Paulie, reveals in a surprising and touching way his regret for having mistreated his sister Adrian over the years.There was a big question whether Stallone would still be able to handle bringing the character back in his 60s. As for physical performance, there is no doubt about the actor's ability. It is in the drama that the actor really surprises. Seeing him with an apparent calm, just to let out a little animalistic snort when he says ""there's a beast inside me"" is impressive, revealing Stallone's careful construction. Rocky is a very easy figure to like, and seeing him talking to Adrian's grave or praising his opponent after the climate fight just illustrates Balboa's good soul. The opponent of the time also demonstrates Stallone's growth as an artist. Far from being a Soviet machine like Ivan Drago in Rocky IV or a simply bad figure like Mr. T in the third film, Mason Dixon is a good fighter who feels limited because he has never faced a challenge at his height - in addition to suffering one. heavy criticism from the media for that - and their frustration comes from a human factor, rather than a simple ""I need to destroy everyone below me"".Mixing fiction and reality, the energetic fight is one of the highlights of the film, although it is hard to believe that a 60-year-old man could present that performance in front of a world champion in full form. But this is a forgivable and even understandable slip, since no one would like to see Rocky taking a massive beating in his last fight. In the end, the fight was a big surprise. Working correctly with the obvious, Stallone is fit and well-rehearsed throughout the rounds. His movement, his clumsy way of hitting and, of course, his characteristic Rocky resistance were very well adapted to the character's age. Do not expect to see a surreal boxer, as Stallone kept his foot on the ground throughout the film and that is a very strong point for success, the realism with which he treats everything, the human way of portraying everyone.
In terms of aesthetics, the kitschy resources of the 1980s were abandoned, and Stallone decided to make the new Rocky in the mold of a current indie production, with some aesthetic preciousness packing the ode to the marginal, the sad and socially displaced. Those who watch this film may not recognize the previous ones: now, the camera is free, trembling, while the photography exaggerates in contrast and saturation, leaving the images grainy and colorful at the same time.
Within the franchise, Rocky Balboa easily stands out as the best film after the original, revealing a mature facet of Sylvester Stallone as an artist, in addition to offering an appropriate development for this who is one of the most affectionate icons of pop culture in the world. A decent retirement for Balboa, as a fighter. For those who think that ""Rocky Balboa"" is more of a boxing film, you will be surprised when you discover that just like the first, what you see is a film about overcoming, only that now from the soul over the body, the character, throughout the entire film, struggles with his interior, trying to forget his past in order to move on, to leave the pain of the loss of his wife and the withdrawal of his son along with the anger that made him a fighter, but for that he needs to get in the ring one last time.The sixth episode of the franchise looks like a beautiful ghost movie: it is slow, contemplative, extremely affective, but still a cinematographic work of our times. The excellent conclusion ties all six works in a cyclical manner, as if a journey has come to an end. This is Stallone's best driving experience, and also a worthy conclusion to the underdog's trajectory who has never ceased to be a fragile, needy man, more attached to family and friends than to fame.The mythology surrounding the Italian Stallion remains alive, even after the sound of the gong and the announcement of the maintenance of his opponent's belt. The last scenes, with Rocky pointing to the audience and holding the hand of one of his fans in the audience, is the perfect ending for Sly's most relevant character. Including his evolution there, who no longer needs to keep a chair in the tree next to his wife's grave, and can finally rest in the memory of his admirers as the prodigal son of Philadelphia, finally returned to the glory he always deserved. The final credits for ""Rocky Balboa"" bring the image of dozens of people climbing the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and imitating Rocky 's gestures. Only this moment would serve to demonstrate the importance of this character in the recent history of cinema.",Rocky Balboa
107,Ruskington,Satisfactory conclusion to the Rocky series,6,13 April 2020,"Given the sketchy track record of delayed sequels and the huge popularity of the Rocky movies, this film had the potential to be one of the biggest flops of the decade. However, Stallone and his producers manage to create an enjoyable, albeit cliched, movie that will satisfy most die-hard fans.Having said that, this is a still a paint-by-numbers generic sports movie with a very predictable ending. There are the usual workout montages, motivational talks and unrealistic fight scenes. The film drags on and is padded out with pointless dialogue.Mason Dixon is probably the least interesting of all the Rocky villains but his character develops nicely and he comes off quite well at the end. He also looks and moves more like an actual boxer than the likes of Lang, Drago and Gunn.Rocky himself is the usual mix of bad acting, mumbled conversations and excessive sentimentality. His friendship/relationship with Marie is borderline creepy and I didn't see much need for it. The flashbacks Rocky has of Adrian and Mickey quickly become tiresome. Why does he only have flashbacks to those two? Does he not have parents, siblings, friends and other memories to dwell on in his middle-age?One thing I really liked about this film though, was the ending. It was a really poignant way for things to finish up and both Rocky and Mason bow out perfectly. The closing montage of members of the public posing on the famous Rocky steps was a great touch and capped the series off perfectly.",Rocky Balboa
108,agmoldham,Hopefully the final instalment of Rocky,5,28 January 2007,"As usual with movies I'd avoided reading any reviews of Rocky Balboa before seeing it. I picked up the vibe that the movie was treated kindly by the US critics and less kindly by the British critics, but beyond that I had few preconceptions.The film is quite similar in style to the original Rocky movie. I personally found the film somewhat devoid of hope with Rocky seemingly in a deep depression about the deaths of Adrian and Mickey. Anyway I don't think I'm giving anything when I say Rocky gets one last chance in the ring. This is the part of the film that that I found stretched the imagination a bit too far. There's no doubt that Stallone still looks good for his age, but the fight was a bit too far fetched. Let's hope this really is the end of the series.",Rocky Balboa
109,Vivekmaru45,Oh Adrian I did it !!! Again ?!!!,3,23 August 2010,"We had to wait 16 years for this piece of garbage. People were expecting action, the likes of Rocky 4. But instead as usual the clueless and brainless Mr. Stallone subjects us to torture by enduring his sixth film in the Rocky series. If you want to torture someone, let's say a prisoner of war or your worst enemy, just let him watch Rocky Balboa and watch him beg(or scream) you to turn off the TV set.Well a man's brain can decompose in 16 years time. Stallone has definitely some sort of fungus growing in it. Mr Stallone time for you to take your dose of antibiotics.... This stubborn man will not quit at any rate and must be sent to an old peoples home or the mental asylum for retired actors and directors.The plot??? Ahem... We see in the start of the film that Adrian is dead (thank god Talia Shire was spared this torture). Rocky regularly visits her at the cemetery. He feels angry that his wife died early and wants to release his pent up anger at someone (why not a mugger in the street or your local tax collector?). So as usual he gets what he wants (hooray !). Alas his opponent is a muscle-less moron who doubts his boxing ability (he doesn't have it anyways, looks like a rapper fresh from the ghetto). So main event Mr. Balboa vs. Mr Mason 'The Line' Dixon.About the fight: you call this pathetic excuse of a boxing match a fight??? I have better fights between cats and dogs or between roosters in the hen-house. Well there you have it kiddies a really good synopsis (I feel happier already!)P.S. I forgot to mention Rocky's love interest (poor Adrian must be rolling in her grave), a washed out chick that goes by the name of Geraldine Hughes (Sly you couldn't get Sharon Stone to sign up ???).The only good actor in the film is Burt Young. I hope Sly paid him well.",Rocky Balboa
110,Danusha_Goska,"LOVED ""Rocky"" (1976). ""Rocky Balboa"" (2006)? Snore.",4,8 January 2007,"I loved, loved, loved, the first ""Rocky."" It's one of my all time favorite movies.I didn't just love it as an uplifting story about a boxer, I loved it as a glimpse into the life of a working class white ethnic (because I'm a working class white ethnic.) I loved Sylvester Stallone's sweet, lumpy, inarticulate sexiness, and Pauly's obnoxiousness, and Burgess Meredith's raspy voice and creepy expertise.I didn't want to see ""Rocky Balboa"" because I feared that it would be cheap cheese. It got good reviews, though, so I took a chance.I was, mostly, really bored. And when I wasn't bored, I felt sad. Sad for ""Rocky"" (1976), which was such a good movie, that doesn't deserve to have its grave robbed so that Sylvester Stallone can be sentimental.""Rocky Balboa,"" in addition to being boring, lacks artistic integrity.It was one thing for a stumblebum never-was boxer to be living in the inner city; why on earth is a former World Champion living in a slum? I just didn't believe it at all.And ... Adrian's death. Adrian is meant to be dead in this movie. But there are many, too many, flashbacks of Adrian from previous Rocky movies, and it is just so obvious that Sylvester Stallone is wringing the Adrian story for all the tears it is worth, without giving Talia Shire any screen time.We all know Rocky and Adrian by now, and we all know Sly and Talia, and her -- Adrian's and Talia's -- absence sticks out like a sore thumb.You find yourself thinking, as you are watching the movie, ""So? Did Talia not want to be in this version? Did she not like the script? Is that why she's not on screen? But there are so many flashbacks ... did Sly not want to be seen with an older actress? Did he want to pair himself with someone younger? The younger Talia Shire? Or is Sly just pulling our heart strings by having Adrian be dead?"" Previous Rockys have had really fun opponents: The unbelievably handsome and suave Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers); the hysterically sadistic Mr. T. Here Rocky's opponent, Mason Dixon, is an uninteresting character.Rocky flirts with a much younger woman and tries to be nice to her son; that sub-plot pretty much goes nowhere. Sly knew he couldn't hop over Adrian's grave, here, to get to his next romantic opportunity with a younger woman, and he doesn't. So why is that subplot even there? Sly shows himself doing nice things -- adopting the ugliest dog in the pound, screwing a light bulb into a fixture for someone who, apparently, can't afford light bulbs, but really, what's the point? As for Rocky's relationship with his son ... it just all felt so forced. His son was stiff and never took on any life or individuality. If Rocky is lonely, he has no one but Sly to blame, because Sly can't script a good son for him.The climax of the movie is the fight, and even this is a bit depressing. Sly / Rocky is 59, and fighting is a young man's game. Sure, you can push yourself into the ring, but wouldn't it be more uplifting to show Rocky phoning Mayflower moving vans and getting himself out of that slum, and into a relationship with a woman who is an age appropriate match for him? Maybe he can bring Adrian back in ""Rocky VII"" by some soap opera convention, by, say, making it her twin sister who died, while she was lost to amnesia.There were a few bright spots in this otherwise dismal movie. Burt Young is still wonderfully obnoxious as Pauly. It's fun to see Rocky's old opponent, Spider, as a dishwasher.The very best thing in this movie came at the end. During the closing credits, various regular people are shown running up the same stairs that the original Rocky ran up, in the original movie, in his sweats, to, when he reached the top, raise his fists over his head in a triumphant gesture. I think a fun film could have been made about that alone. Who are these people? What went through their heads as they made that run? What did the original Rocky inspire them to do? That's the film I wish Stallone had made.",Rocky Balboa
111,jpschapira,"""It's not over 'til it's over""",7,19 May 2007,"I'm a big fan of Sylvester Stallone, so I'm not going to lie to you: when I heard this movie was coming out, I couldn't wait. In fact, Stallone put the first pages of the screenplay in a magazine he had (I don't know if he still has it) and I was able to read themThey didn't sound so bad, coming from a man who's had it rough in the film industry; mostly from critics. I never stopped watching his films, and I don't want to make a relation between ""Rocky"" and Stallone's life, but Rocky's comeback in the film is also a big comeback for the actor; and he emerges triumphant.I will never forget a phrase spoken by a character in ""Driven"", a film written by Stallone. ""It's not about how many times you fall, but about how fast you get up"". That's the Rocky mode, and Stallone shapes the words a little bit for this new screenplay. Everything in ""Rocky Balboa"" is new and old at the same time; it's, in the end, Rocky's life with blasts from the past.In fact, Rocky seems to be stuck in the past. Therefore we get the usual flashbacks, now very accurately placed by Stallone in his director role. He knows the story by heart, well enough to reinvent it a thousand times. Who better than Stallone himself to direct this last movie and put the right memories at the right time? And how he lives with these memories and tries to cope with them becomes his piece's main appeal.With the fading cuts, he takes us through the story once again; developing parallel plot lines within the big plot line: the troubled relationship between Rocky and his son (played convincingly by Milo Ventimiglia), the relationship with an old and now virtually nonsensical Paulie (Burt Young, of course), the life and issues of Rocky's new rival Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) and also a little bit of love for Rocky's heart.It's true that everything is a little bit egotistical, with practically every person congratulating Rocky all the time at the beginning of the film, asking him for autographs and old stories about fight, but Stallone finds a balance and makes good use of the ego element. Even though he knows it, it sure wasn't an easy task to bring the character back in a new light; and I'm not talking about the story, but about the performance. Stallone makes this aged Rocky tender and calm; unable to forget but with compassion, in a winning and measured portrayalA rediscovery and evidence enough for anyone who thought he didn't deserve his only Oscar nomination.However, the most amazing rediscovery comes with Bill Conti's score. He took the classic melodies and made an uncountable number of arrangements. Not once, the ""Gonna Fly Now"" tune, whether sung or played, appears to be the same during ""Rocky Balboa""; Conti has piano, strings and even an electric guitar in the iconic 'going up the stairs' scene, where Rocky gets to the top and raises his hand before the camera makes a still image of the momentThat's a good cliché; maybe just a Rocky cliché.Stallone's screenplay for ""Rocky Balboa"" is surprisingly not clichéd, but it is very corny. It's too corny for its own good, because it deals with the important issues seriously, but the corny factor turns against it. It's not all bad, though: there are some compelling and moving moments in it and, as he takes us to the final fight, we feel that the script is short and that Stallone had a lot more to say. This feeling is accentuated near the ending, where everything moves kind of fast. The movie lasts 95 minutesMaybe Stallone needed more.Leaving the script aside, what's clichéd is the Rocky story in general; we all know. Stallone plays with this expectation element in the last scenes, arriving at conclusions for the big issues that are so deliberately blatant and therefore worthy of applause; and finally make the film more honest. The fight is presented as if it was an original HBO TV presentation. It's a good call by Stallone, who accentuates crucial moments of the fight with stylized black and white shots, changing instantly to color and to black and white again.Because that's what ""Rocky"" ultimately is: a fight. ""Rocky Balboa"" has elements from all the other five installments. It would be nice if you sat down one whole day and watched the complete ""Rocky"" AnthologyThis film is a perfect ending for it and, as Rocky himself would say: ""I'd appreciate it"".",Rocky Balboa
112,Maziun,Good comeback sequel,6,1 November 2013,"It's a risk to make a sequel to a franchise that was dead for 16 years. It's even harder when you realize that the sequel is a SIXTH movie in the series. The filmmakers aren't too often able to make a second and third movie in the series good . Movies with number 4 and so on are mostly a cheap imitations of original , trying to steal a few bucks from the audience . Thankfully this is not one of those movies.""Rocky Balboa"" is a surprisingly good movie . It does rely heavily on the nostalgia , yet it's a worthy addition to the series . The story is rather predictable and some elements lack freshness (the training , the fight) , but you have to remember that a boxing movie doesn't allow you to do too much in terms of story.Stallone makes a lot of nods to previous movies and the loyal fans of Rocky will be pleased with that . Sylvester made movie that is more than a present for fans . It's a good movie overall . At it's heart it's a story about going into obscurity , getting older , fading away . It feels honest , because at the time he made ""Rocky Balboa"" Stallone was pretty much a forgotten star , echo of the past . This movie has honesty that equals the honesty of the first ""Rocky"" (which was also very autobiographical ) . There is certain sadness here that doesn't feel sappy or forced.The one important message that ""RB"" is trying to send is to always have dignity . Believe in who you are . Don't blame others for your failures , blame yourself . Only cowards look for excuses . Life is all about taking punches from the fate and going forward with head raised high. Be brave and you might succeed.""Rocky Balboa"" brought Stallone back to the mainstream cinema after appearing in more or less crap movies . Now he's having a second youth. It's good to have him back . It shows you how much true the message of ""RB"" is.I give it 6/10.",Rocky Balboa
113,tonypeacock-1,Rocky franchise comeback is actually a triumph,8,27 April 2020,"Interesting update to the Rocky Balboa franchise that certainly improves on the sour taste left after seeing Rocky V in 1990.Balboa is a lot older (aren't we all), Adrian is dead, Paulie is a pensioner, Tony Burton (Apollo Creeds old trainer) looks the same.The actual fight choreography is a massive improvement on the 70s and 80s Rocky fights. More realistic than the sound effect, make up filled choreography of the old Creed fights.The film does lurch too much on the emotions of the death of Adrian. All we really want to see is Rocky Balboa in training scenes running up the steps of the Philadelphia city hall.Stallone is far too old for this about 25 years ago and looks mangled before the fight!
Interestingly Mike Tyson has a cameo at ringside. In real life wasnt he world champ in 1988 a full two years before the events of Rocky V?I have always hated the Paulie character (played by Burt Young). In this film I discovered he is called Paulie Panini. He is a peripheral waste of screentime and he should have been killed by some of Apollos gangland contacts in Rocky III!At least the final fight and its ending is believable. The fight choreography is a big improvement on the earlier film. I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the film!Geraldine Hughes is a sort of love interest now that Adrian (Talia Shire) has died.The use of real sports reporters looks more realistic than the coverage in earlier films along with the computer simulations.Despite Stallone's obvious advancing years (and waistline) the film is a comeback triumph.",Rocky Balboa

115,oneloveall,Unnecessary but appropriate closure,5,17 December 2006,"The final installment of Americas beloved boxing superstar finds the aged ex champ fighting one more time. Well what else would be happening? Awkwardly trying to provide closure to the franchise while stumbling it's way to a sub-par final showdown, at least Rocky Balboa ends in a way all too familiar to fans, which I'm sure satiates their need in the face of the less approved Rocky V. Was this concluding chapter necessary to the Rocky saga? Absolutely not. After 10 years this underwhelming retread into Balboa's humble roots somehow becomes tedious instantaneously, a self important, shallow venture into one last paycheck. Where Sylvester Stallone was when he created the original Rocky films is and will always be that ultimate place of triumph for any young sports lover's dreams, but as sequel continued to parallel original, the worlds most popular movie theme song became just that. Stallone has depleted his emotional array of boxing material and in turn cheapened the sacredness of the originals that little more. Although this confused goodbye to the dumbed down, but wised up champ suffers from a numbing predictability and surprising coldness that mirrored the films style and location to a fault, we find that same clockwise pace amping us up one more time, even if it is the geriatric equivalent. Stallone is able to live up to his end of the bargain with one more engaging turn in one of modern American cinema's most popular characters, but the supporting cast is troubled, from the overdone antics of Burt Young's classic Paulie character to the tepid forgetablity of the main ""opponent"". Even the love story, so pure once in context, now seems uninspired, near depressing. In the end despite the vacant and lame attempt prompting this guy to fight one more time, once that round ten draws near the end, Balboa head to toe a pure ball of ground beef, pulsating blood and spit in his last few breaths of will to land a punch, does actually end up conquering the goodwill of the people one last time- damn those infernally good memories of better prequels and their manipulative power!",Rocky Balboa
116,Superunknovvn,Rocky retires,6,19 August 2007,"I'm sure there are a lot of people like me who can say that the ""Rocky"" movies accompanied them through their childhood. Rocky Balboa was my hero and in a way he still is. That formula Sylvester Stallone came up with in the 70's just gets me every time: an underdog struggles hard to get his chance and when he does he uses it. And no matter whether he wins the fight or not, the fact that he tried his best makes him a winner. That simple formula corresponded well with audiences all around the world and it proved to be applicable in lots of different ways: from the straight drama that was the first part to more and more action filled movies. Of course, by part V the series had become a bit of a joke, so a sixth chapter was unlikely. Still, when Sly Stallone announced he was working on another ""Rocky""-flick, more than just a few people were excited about it. But how was it supposed to work? Stallone had just turned 60. There's no way he could play a Champion boxer anymore, or could he? Well, the truth is that ""Rocky Balboa"" isn't really about boxing anymore. Determined to make a drama in the style of the first ""Rocky"" again, Stallone put in LOTS of dialog and shot the whole thing with ultra-realistic shaky hand-camera. If it wasn't the tradition of this franchise, I'm sure there wouldn't have been a final fight this time. Of course, nobody would have been interested if Rocky wouldn't throw some punches one last time, so Stallone came up with this questionable premise: when a sports program shows a computer generated match between the Italian Stallion and the current boxing Champion, people's interest is sparked so much that some boxing managers are talking Rocky into getting in the ring one more time for an exhibition.It sounds very stupid on paper, but it makes sense more or less in the movie. This isn't like part V, which also tried to be a drama, but never seemed realistic. ""Rocky Balboa"" tries much harder to be believable. This shows best in the big fight. Where Rocky's fights have always been filmed like action scenes in the past, this time the first rounds are shown the way the would be broadcast on an actual sports channel. It makes the whole thing seem (a bit) more realistic, but of course it also takes away some of the tension that made Rocky's fights against Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago so damn entertaining.And that's the major problem of ""Rocky Balboa"" right there. The Italian Stallion used to fight important matches, sometimes even for the honor of his country. This time it's just an exhibition and no one except Rocky himself seems to care, anyway. Not that anything else would have been appropriate. This is the only way this movie could have been done and I'm glad Stallone didn't try to make another ""Rocky IV"", but that doesn't take away from the fact that ""Rocky Balboa"" is a bit anti-climatic.Look at it as a life cycle: youth (parts I & II) is about innocence, your thirties (parts III & IV) are the most turbulent and thrilling times of your life. Once you've retired (parts IV & V) you finally are able to do everything you always wanted to do, but mostly you're living on the memories of your glory days. ""Rocky Balboa"" is nice to watch, but only because we already know and love the character so much. Had it not been for the previous installments, this movie wouldn't be so interesting on its own. As the last chapter of a legendary movie franchise it's an appropriate way for a beloved character to retire.",Rocky Balboa

Of course Rocky won't back down and gives him a proper beating in the fight, Dixon won but we as an audience know that Rocky's reputation has been strengthened, in his prime Dixon wouldn't have stood a chance.8/10: Great film",Rocky Balboa
118,DarthVoorhees,The Italian Stallion goes out with dignity,10,1 January 2007,"We had to wait thirty years for the best Rocky sequel. He isn't fighting soviet monster boxers or Mr.T, Rocky is back to his roots. Sly Stallone reprises the role that made his career. Stallone is truly under-appreciated in a lot of ways,particularly his writing skills. The screenplay for Rocky Balboa is fantastic. Yes the earlier Rocky sequels were corny but that doesn't take away from Sly's full potential as a storyteller. I think a lot of people looked over this film,which is truly a shame. I've talked to people who have said the idea of Rocky Balboa coming out of retirement in his mid 50's is ridiculous and beyond belief. Why? Isn't the underdog fighter the concept of the original Rocky? Stallone has obviously read the message boards and negative rumors about Rocky VI because he avoids all the clichés people thought would happen in this movie. I admit I had doubts when Stallone said Adrian would not be in this sequel. I thought to myself what is Rocky going to do without his wings but after actually seeing the film I know taking away Rocky's true emotional support was exactly what Stallone wanted. Rocky is a broken man in this film who can't accept the fact that time does pass. There is a great sequence in the film where Rocky visits the places that were significant in his life, this scene perfectly sets the tone for Rocky's character in this film. He is shown in a more tragic light, he can't move on with his life, he frequently visits his wife's grave and his restaurant is decked to the brim with memorabilia from his golden days. When ESPN launches a computer simulated match up between Balboa and the current champ Mason Dixon the sporting world becomes interested in Rocky again. Rocky comes to realize that he may be able to let out his emotions if he fights again. Once Dixon's managers hear about Rocky's application for a boxing license they campaign to have Rocky fight him. Rocky is hesitant to fight Dixon but eventually agrees after he is encouraged by his old friend Marie(The little girl who delivered the iconic ""Screw You Creepo"" line) Stallone is smart to not portray Dixon as an over the top villain, he is a respectable fighter who is disliked because he has faced no real challenger. Stallone does everything right with Rocky Balboa. This isn't a cartoon film like the other sequels, this film displays real heart. Some say you can't really truly appreciate a character until you've seen them go through their worst and prevail, and after seeing Rocky Balboa I have developed a greater appreciation for the Italian Stallion. Rocky is the essential inspirational character in movie going history. The Academy would never do it but I think Stallone deserves credit for Writing and Acting...",Rocky Balboa

I personally wasn't impressed at all, it was so obvious Stallone was being pretty conceited and unrealistic with this project. I mean i haven't seen the new rambo, but i wasn't impressed here. The advantage of this film was there were definitely some better written sequences than Rocky 3-5, and even Rocky 2 for the most part, however i just couldn't believe Stallone at all, i mean a world champion contender with that many stretch marks and that old age look all over his skin, sorry, not working.

121,qormi,Senior Slugger,6,2 January 2007,"Stallone is still slugging away 30 years later. The fight sequences in this movie are the best since Rocky I. Rocky II through IV featured Stallone getting hammered in the face around two hundred times per bout in some of the phoniest fighting ever. This movie was high on schmaltz and could have been a little edgier. The James Bond films have taken a more down to earth approach with ""Casino Royale"". This latest ""Rocky"" installment should have followed suit. Where did Stallone find the guy who played Mason Dixon? He's the only boxer I've ever seen lacking a muscular physique. He's pudgy and soft looking. It makes it easier to suspend your imagination and accept the premise that a 59 year-old guy could box someone 35 years his junior if his opponent looks like he trains on Hostess Snowballs.

Meanwhile, young champion black boxer Mason Dixon has lost popularity because he has been easily defeating weak boxers in the ring, and the fans want a real challenge for a change. And the sports world is talking about Rocky and Mason possibly having a match...
The problem is, the movie is very slow-moving and fails to evoke the emotions it intends to. The movie is full of nighttime scenes, where Rocky philosophizes, talks with his son, and some other people from his past, and it plods on so that all tension is lost. Will elderly Rocky actually fight young Mason Dixon? Could Rocky possibly win? Does anybody care? I didn't.",Rocky Balboa
123,DonFishies,Rocky's nostalgic return is better than anyone could have imagined,7,14 July 2007,"Despite one of them always showing up on television, I have sadly never watched a Rocky film beginning to end. I have seen most of the first four (Rocky V always eludes me), but never have I seen one in an entire sitting. Despite this, I wanted to see Rocky Balboa, the sixth film in the ""epic"" saga. I heard really good things (despite the trailers all looking like a really bad joke), and looked to it as a possible means of springing onto watching the entirety of the other films.Taking place years after Rocky V, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is now running a restaurant and entertaining guests with old fight stories. Adrian is dead, his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) barely wants to speak to him because of what a hardship it has been living with his father's legacy, and Paulie (Burt Young) is just trying to live in the present, and forget about the past. But when a computerized fight is televised between Rocky in his prime, and the current champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver), it gets Rocky thinking that he should get back into boxing.Sadly, the reason I laughed during the trailers, is because it ruined the fact that Rocky does fight Dixon at some point during the movie. But leading up to their bout, there is so much more meaningful and genuinely emotional things going on than I ever would have expected. Rocky is a beaten and miserable old man. He longs for the olden days, and he longs to be back with Adrian. I thought that a Rocky movie now was a bad idea, but the way he is characterized here is enough to warrant a reappearance by the Italian Stallion. Stallone makes his most famous character vulnerable, and makes him wounded and fragile to the outside world. He is not a joke here, but a play on what Stallone has become: a wash-out longing to come back. Whether this was just a desperate ploy by an aging actor for one last chance at greatness, or a genuine attempt at bringing a sense of nostalgia back to audiences who loved Rocky, is not certain. What is, is that Stallone finally took his character to a place he never was, and adds a great deal of depth that was sadly missing from the moments I had seen from Rocky II, Rocky III and Rocky IV.What he also does right is bringing nostalgia into the picture. One scene in the film involves Rocky and Paulie going to all the places that remind Rocky of his love for Adrian. As he goes to the old ice rink (now demolished), or to the pet store she worked at, we see glimpses of Adrian herself (Talia Shire, in archived form), and we get a peek at the stuff that made the Rocky films so legendary and loved to start with (or at least, popular enough to warrant five sequels). But it does not stop there. The entire film is loaded with minor flashback images (surprisingly, glimpses of Rocky V are suspiciously missing), harking back to the old days of when Rocky was king. It was a nice touch by Stallone to add these in, and again, gave a great deal of depth to what could have only been assumed to be a joke of a film to start with. And when that old theme song perks up, and the training montage begins, I dare anyone not to feel a little reminiscent of old memories.The rest of the film is not all that bad. It drags in a few instances (specifically during long-winded tangents with Stallone going on and on about trivial things and loosing the Rocky voice more than a few times), and in others, just feels like a build-up to the big fight, and nothing else. I liked the majority of the minor character moments for Rocky and Paulie, but when they try and build something for Ventimiglia's Robert, it falls flat. I wanted to actually like Ventimiglia in this role, but it just does nothing for him. He kind of stands around, waiting to do something, and never gets the moment to do it. He spends the majority of the film completely oblivious of his father, but we never really get a deep idea as to why. It makes for a few interesting moments, but a lot more of just beggings as to why Stallone did not give more for him to do.Supporting turns from Young and Tarver are fairly well done. Young is very comfortable as Paulie, and only adds to the great deal of nostalgia taking place throughout the film. I am very glad that Stallone kept at least one of his original characters (and actors) in the film aside from himself. Tarver has very little to do, but he does an okay job with it. Like Ventimiglia, he looks like he is going for a lot of emotions that are not really there for his character to access. I would have liked a little bit more of a fleshing out with his character, as he is not quite as much of a villain as he is just a misunderstood kid.Geraldine Hughes does alright as the minor love interest (and object of affection behind Adrian). She gets a lot of material dedicated to her character and her increasing relationship with Rocky, and when it is not just bogging the film down, it is done fairly well. Her son Steps (James Francis Kelly III) probably could have done with a bit more fleshing out though.For the most part, Stallone's swan song to his most famous character was done a whole lot better than I think anyone expected. It has more than a few issues, but for the most part, is a nostalgic ride for anyone who ever had any enjoyment for a Rocky movie.7/10.",Rocky Balboa
124,rajdoctor,Rocky Balbao,4,20 January 2007,"Rocky Balbao I am a die-hard Rocky fan. I have been inspired by the underdog story, and I remember having Rocky poster in front of my bed during college life. I remember having written an essay named  ""The Philosophy of Rocky"". It was about the fight for survival, fight for overcoming obstacles, fight in believing in oneself against all odds. That is the philosophy of Rocky.I had liked the first Rocky a lot  for me it was and will always remain a cult film. Rocky 2 was also good  but not as good as the first one. Rocky 3 and 4 were too much in commercial mold  being good movies, but not going above the trademark movie stuff. I found Rocky 5 different and good, very close to Rocky 1. That was the time I had thought that yes the era of Rocky is over. But not yet  Sylvester Stallone had his last Rocky story to tell you.The setting of the story is perfect. Rocky has grown old, and facing a crisis in defining his inner flame which is still burning  until a computer game projects the fight of Rocky with the current World Heavy weight champion Dixon and shows Rocky winning the fight. The roll out of money inspires the promoters to propose an exhibition match between Rocky and Dixon. Nobody is ready to believe in the old ugly man  until he decides to give it a shot and agree for the match. I would not tell the ending of the last episode of Rocky saga. I was expecting an ending  but the ending surprised me.Sylvester Stallone looks his age and has not tried to hide it. As a director Sylvester recognizes the critics, and throughout the movie tries to address and justify that as an old ugly and down man  he inspires to fight. There are usual Rocky personal characteristics that showcase a very humane side of the character called Rocky, which we all loved. Like Rocky 1, 2 and 5; this movie is a drama.The story is clichéd and moves predictably as per the Rocky format  nothing new or surprising. Everything seen before! Last three points  First, Sylvester has maintained his body quite good even in his old age of 64 years that he can remove his shirt and go into the ring and show his muscle power; kudos to that spirit of working hard and coming back. Second, I hear that Sylvester is coming with Rambo 4  that is interesting, because the character of Rocky is different from Rambo and with more action in, it may have better chance to fair at the box office. Third and last, I heard from my wife that Mike Tyson wanted to play Dixon and fight Rocky in movie, and insisted a lot to Sylvester to cast him, but Sylvester did not agree. But we see Mike Tyson in the movie on the ring side cheering Dixon.My tribute to the Rocky I loved and in the end the curtain has to fall and hopefully it has fallen. This should be and I insist  should be the final movie in Rocky series. Let the good memories of Rocky remain! (4.5 Stars)",Rocky Balboa
125,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,13 February 2021,"""The world always tries to bring you down, but you have to be stronger"". Rocky 's striking phrase, and of course, Stallone made a beautiful ending to the franchise. A film with various motivations, flashbacks and emotions. Rock Balboa was undoubtedly one of the best in the franchise, equaling the first.

126,dr_foreman,The people's champ,9,20 December 2006,"I knew I was gonna like this.Our modern popular culture seems to be entirely dominated by youth and sarcasm. That really annoys me. But guess who's the perfect cure for Generation-Y insincerity? Rocky Balboa, a tough old man who is nothing if not genuine, and infinitely wise in his way.Yeah, it's the social commentary in this movie that really appeals to me. Stallone takes some dead-on potshots at today's ageist, materialistic, smart-alec society. And, in a more positive vein, he reaffirms Rocky's simple (but not at all trite) message that family love, self-pride and plain old courage can always carry the day.This film is not at all cheesy. In some respects, it's reminiscent of the much-loathed (but really not bad) Rocky V. Both films have a gritty feel, like the first movie, and they both feature a lot of hardship and tragedy. But, unlike Rocky V, ""Rocky Balboa"" puts our hero back in the ring for one last fight - and that's what we want to see.Even the fight isn't cheesy; it's directed in a much more realistic fashion than Rocky's previous bouts. And man, it is rousing.I'm glad to see that movie critics are giving this film pretty good reviews. But I'd argue that they're still being stingy. Critics seem to specialize in world-weary sarcasm - they love coming up with ""witty"" put-downs for movies - but I think the general viewing public will be more receptive to an honest feel-good movie like ""Rocky Balboa."" In fact, I'm confident that the average person will cheer at the end of this movie...without any hint of irony.",Rocky Balboa
127,vampyrecowboy,Hopefully this is the last one,7,19 February 2009,"Rocky looks tired.He's old, barely alive and just has little spark on the screen.Even the final fight looks tired and poorly set up and choreographed.The story is so-so, the dialog is on the lower scale and the settings lack color.The characters are also week in this one.After 20 or so years, it's time to end the series.I rated this a 7 because it finishes the rest and isn't a dismal failure, but gets by.Little to offer and almost like #3.A weak cast and buildup, but still entertaining - especially if you saw the others and who didn't? If you never saw the rest, this will be boring and slow, but to sum all the rest up, it's a decent enough closing.",Rocky Balboa
128,LazySod,No good at all,3,7 February 2007,"Thirty years ago a film was released with the name Rocky. In that film a young boxer went from outcast to hero by winning an absolute against the odds battle. The film had tension, left the watcher with a good feeling, and kept the watcher tied to the screen for its full running time.A number of sequels were made, all worse than the original, a gradual decline. Then in 2006, a final sequel was made. And please, let this be the final one. Story wise this one was better than the other sequels but acting wise it was the worst ever. I felt like I was watching the average episode of a soap opera where all the ""actors"" were having a bad day and just saying their lines.No single moment of the film stepped out of the dreary standards of ""no good at all"" and with that this was a long thing to sit through. Not worth of the tape it was filmed on, not worthy of the cinema time allotted to it. I guess it could have been worse, but this was just too standard, too thirteen in a dozen.3 out of 10 knocked up boxers.",Rocky Balboa
129,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Rocky Balboa (2006),8,22 March 2007,"Philadelphia's number one film son returns to the big screen in 'Rocky Balboa'. Rocky is struggling to come to terms with his life after he retires. Adrian's passing has left Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) a widower who lives more in the past than the now which strains the few relationships that he has, namely his son Robert ,Jr. (now played by 'Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia) and his nutty brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young). But when a computer simulation pits a in-his-prime Rocky vs. the current undefeated champion Mason Dixon (boxer Antonio Tarver) Rocky becomes focused on a return to the ring to let loose the 'beast' one final time.The fire and heart returns in this, the sixth time around the ring for the former champ. Stallone had felt that the fifth outing was a weak way to send out the much beloved screen character and set to dust him off for one last bout. This Rocky feels much like the original, back are the heart and soul of the man. Rocky is down on his luck and with this sequel you can't help but stand up and cheer for him. Stallone writes a wonderful script full of heart and drama. The acting is superb (including Irish lass Geraldine Hughes as a new love interest) and his portrayal is the best it's been since the original. Sly's direction was very good as well but I didn't like the way the final fight was presented. Filmed as though it were a PPV event it really cut down the drama for me and ending up feeling a bit rushed as a result. That one snag aside 'Rocky Balboa' is the best since the original and truly a wonderful way to leave one of the big screen's most lovable characters.",Rocky Balboa

I think why I liked this movie is because the acting, and more importantly the message that comes across throughout. Stallone did a great job on the acting and had a great underlying message in the movie. No it's not the typical rocky. It's the rocky that misses his wife and loves his kid. Great ending to the story...",Rocky Balboa
131,FilmFanInTheHouse,An emotional finale for Rocky,8,26 July 2007,"Rocky Balboa (2006, Dir. Sylvester Stallone) Rocky Balboa is finding life hard. His wife, Adrian has unfortunately died and the relationship between him and his son isn't fantastic. A virtual fight is played between an in his prime Rocky Balboa and Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. Rocky wins this virtual fight, which causes the boxing world to become interest. Rocky can't resist the temptation, and enters the ring for one final fight against Dixon. 'Rocky Balboa' is an emotional tribute of sorts to the 'Rocky' franchise. Sylvester Stallone easily fits back into the character again, and really brings the movie to life. Thankfully, Burt Young agreed to reprise his role as Paulie, which gives some great continuation to the previous films. It would have been nice with Talia Shire back, but i do feel that the film has a greater story without her. The action in the boxing match if fun, and i enjoyed this a lot more than the previous five 'Rocky' movies.""Don't you think you're a little, you know, old?"" - Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia)",Rocky Balboa
132,buiger,What a surprise!!!,8,27 May 2007,"I must say I was very skeptical when I heard that a 'Rocky 6' was in the works, and that Stallone will basically be doing everything in that motion picture: starring, writing, directing, etc. Having seen the movie now, I cannot but show my respect for what Stallone did here. This was a movie well done. Above all, and most surprisingly, it was a movie which was very well written. It was also well acted. I cannot remember any film in which Stallone came anywhere near the acting potential he has displayed here (quite honestly - and I never believed I would ever say this - I believe the Academy treated him unfairly, because he deserved at least an Oscar nomination for the acting and the screenplay here).I think this is mainly because this was a movie Stallone made with all his heart. In many ways, I think it is autobiographical. It is a story of a man who is aging and trying to find a new meaning in life in this by now very much changed and changing world while reminiscing on his successful past. I think this is something that sooner or later happens to all of us, and if you look hard enough you will see it all around you.Consequently, Stalloone makes a conscious (and very smart choice) to actually have very little boxing in this film. This is not an action film about boxing, this is a film about emotions, state of mind and the existential questions in life. Very much like the original Rocky that started it all... My compliments to Stallone!",Rocky Balboa

Rocky feels the itch to come out of retirement, and decides to scratch it! It seems far fetched, but I got caught up in the comeback and did indeed feel the old 1-1V juices flowing! Maybe 'cause I'm older now too! Either way, it's a good ending, and Stallone even throws down some acting chops in a scene or two! I also loved the clips of people running up the steps at the end during the credits. Kinda shows how the whole ""Rocky"" thing has gotten into the social fabric of a lot of us.

134,buccaneer21,Making Up For Rocky V,10,9 October 2017,"Well,sixteen years after the last Rocky movie was shown that was supposedly the conclusion of the Rocky movie franchise - Rocky V - was released in 1990,Sylvester Stallone has been quoted saying that he was extremely disappointed with it that he decided to make another Rocky movie that would become the fitting conclusion rather than Rocky V.In 1999,he wrote a screenplay and asked producers to make another Rocky film.Luckily,he was able to do another one in Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI despite the fact that it took 6 years before it was finally shot.Once again,Sylvester Stallone stars and directed a story that fans saw a 60-year-old Rocky Balboa at his Philadelphia working class neighborhood.We discover that his wife Adrian has already passed away due to cancer and visits her grave often.We also see him having some conflict with his son,Rocky Jr. who happens to be now a professional in the city.We also discover that the young Marie of Rocky I becomes close and somehow a romantic interest of Rocky despite their big age difference similar to a father and daughter.Finally,we get to see the current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon asking him for a challenge to a fight after concluding that the champion will easily beat Rocky.Then,we get to see Rocky go back to the process of becoming a fighter again from having a hard time seeking his boxing license,his training, his inspiration coming from his late wife and surprisingly his son whom he has had conflict, and how he went the distance with the champion despite being the underdog - as always a familiar theme in Rocky movies - and many predicting that Rocky would not go the distance.But in the end,Rocky did go the distance despite losing a split decision.This allowed him for people to respect him again and for movie fans to fall in love with his character once again that made way for a spin-off movie franchise Creed,wherein Rocky is a major supporting character as the boxing trainer of Adonis Johnson,the illegitimate child of Apollo Creed.No question that ""Rocky Balboa"" - the sixth installment of the Rocky movie franchise - revived Rocky.First,it made up for the disappointing Rocky V as we get to see Rocky once again go to the ring as an underdog rather than a trainer,which we see later in the ""Creed"" movie franchise.Second,we get to see an update on the story of Rocky especially in the later stages of his life when he feels sorrow and depression after his wife passed away due to cancer and how he spends time with her in Adrian's grave to relate his feelings and emotions.In addition to that,we also see him as a restaurant owner of ""Adrian's"" - named after his wife- and the challenge that he receives from the heavyweight champion - Mason ""The Line"" Dixon - to an exhibition fight similar to the one he received from Apollo Creed in the first two movies and how the fight went the distance despite losing via split decision. With all these mentioned,I must say that ""Rocky Balboa"" truly makes up for Rocky V. Fans of all ages will also be inspired especially in these difficult economic times for Americans to emulate Rocky's attitude towards life particularly of not giving up no matter how difficult the situation life presents us and how the 60-year old underdog continues to practice them late in life. Finally,it paved way to see more of Rocky that led to the Creed movie franchise as a boxing trainer that will lead young people into emulating his attitude and principles in life particularly Adonis Johnson,a rich young man who turned into a boxer.",Rocky Balboa
135,maria2023,Supposedly The Final Film About Rocky......Until Creed Was Released,10,9 October 2017,"After Rocky V was released in theaters back in 1990 - 16 years before this movie ""Rocky Balboa"" a.k.a ""Rocky VI"" was shown,many Rocky fans were somewhat disappointed with the so-called then ""conclusion"" of the Rocky franchise after its first film - Rocky I - was released in 1976 when it became a sleeper hit. Even movie star Sylvester Stallone was extremely disappointed himself.But then,he decided to make up for it after 16 years and starred,wrote and directed the 6th installment of the Rocky franchise.Surprise...Surprise....It actually became the best sequel of Rocky I as compared to the rest such as Rocky's II to V. In ""Rocky Balboa"",we once again find a sad and depressed aging Rocky,who apparently has lost his wife Adrian - his source of inspiration in the franchise - due to cancer.We see him speak to her at her grave and sharing his feelings and emotions as if she is there listening to him.We see that Rocky also has been into the restaurant business owning one named after his late wife,""Adrian"" at his hometown in Philadelphia. Aside from that,we also see him having a strained relationship with his son Robert Jr. a.k.a Rocky Jr. as the latter cannot accept the fact of living behind his father's shadow.Finally,we also see him get back into the ring after the current heavyweight champion of the world - Mason ""The Line"" Dixon - challenged him into an exhibition fight after confidently predicting that he would beat Rocky by a knockout so easily.When Rocky decided to accept the challenge - the same way he accepted to fight Apollo Creed back in 1976 - as an underdog,we begin to get curious whether Rocky would go the distance or not despite being 60 years old.And are we surprised that he did despite losing the bout in a split decision(split decision? - sounds familiar).This was supposedly the final film of Rocky movie franchise.Then ""Creed"" was released and became a sleeper hit 40 years after Rocky I was released.In ""Creed"", Rocky became the trainer like Mickey particularly to Apollo Creed's illegitimate son,Adonis Johnson.But nevertheless,this film - Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI - became a fitting conclusion to the Rocky movie franchise as we get to see how Rocky once again delivered as an underdog and how he was able to reunite himself with his son and how he offered his final fight to his late wife Adrian.We also see his heart and soul in his 60's;the impression of his career in boxing; and how he late in his life would still hold on the values that made him a memorable and endearing character among movie fans such as not giving up in life in times especially in times of sorrow and depression as well as having an ongoing relationship with his late wife that continues to inspire him in the latter stages of his life journey despite the fact that she is no longer with him.Overall,Stallone has made one of the best sequels of Rocky and it was only right to become the final film or fitting conclusion - whether Creed was released or not - of a great Rocky movie franchise or the story of Rocky.",Rocky Balboa
136,theshadow908,On a par with the first one.,8,5 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa picks up 16 years after the last film. Adrian has died, Rocky's son Robert is a corporate executive, and Rocky runs a restaurant called Adrian's where he likes to tell patrons stories of his fighting days. Meanwhile, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon is the heavyweight champion of the world, but he's losing fans and respect because he fights people who can't fight back. The sports network broadcasts a digital fight between Rocky and Dixon, and the computer says Rocky would win. This inspires Rocky to get a boxing license so he can fight in local clubs. When Dixon hears about this, he challenges Rocky to an exhibition match. Rocky, obviously, accepts. This movie is just like the first one, and just as good. It is just as much an underdog story as it was 30 years ago.Sylvester Stallone wrote and directed this sixth installment into the Rocky series, and he made sure that it was on par with the first. Characters from the first film make an appearance again, including little Marie from the corner, and Spider Rico, which gives the movie a connection. The movie takes what may seem like a bogus story and makes it completely believable. People who say this movie doesn't have a believable story obviously haven't seen it. Ever heard of George Forman? He made an unlikely comeback as well, close to the same age. Stallone chose to kill off Adrian, which to me was a smart move. This made Rocky Balboa a more emotional movie. His relationship with his son is on the rocks, and he's trying to fix it. This is also a good plot point. Everything that made the first film good is back in this one. The training montage, the music, the story, the ending, even the poster is similar. It's like bookends. Now Sylvester Stallone can proudly say that the Rocky franchise went out with a bang instead of a whimper.The acting was pretty good all around. I really liked Milo Ventimiglia as Rocky Jr. Sly did good in the role that made him and Burt Young was as good as ever in the role of Paulie.Fans of the first movie should not miss this movie.

137,tastyhotdogs,"Yo Adrian, it's finally over",6,26 February 2007,"Went last night to the final chapter of one of cinema's greatest characters, Rocky Balboa.Had read mixed reviews on ""Rocky Balboa"" and probably went in not expecting too much. Here's my thoughts:-Sly's head is so funny looking, it's hard to look away -Why does Paulie have to come on all Rocky's ""Adrian Tours""? He doesn't wanna be there, and wouldn't it be easier for Rocky to be by himself? What was so great about Adrian anyway? She never supported him and then turned up to his fights when he's had the suitcase beaten out of him and then wills him to a win. Bit late in my books. -Besides no longer having Adrian, he has the worst child in entertainment history besides Kim Bauer. What a little brat. No wonder he wanted to take Marie's kid under his wing. -Man that first hour dragged on a bit, way too much emotional build up if you ask me. -Stallone sure doesn't write well for other characters. None of the other characters that have appeared in Rocky have been remotely likable. -As you'd expect, a great training sequence again, but not much more after that. The fight was alright. -If you're gonna have a Tyson cameo in a boxing film, why not get him to fight. Rocky should have fought Tyson to contend for the Nixon fight. That would have been awesome.Overall 6.5/10. An OK closer to the Rocky franchise, especially if like me you didn't see Rocky V",Rocky Balboa

Rocky balboa follows the same path of rocky 1 honestly. Sylvester stallone's direction is very good. Whatever you speak foul about him, when he directs a rocky film, writes a rocky film and become rocky balboa, he gives his heart into it. The best scene of this film is when rocky gives his son a lesson on life. That scene is very emotional and inspirational. Reboot of flying high now was also nice.

140,mmallon4,Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks?,8,10 May 2019,"Rocky Balboa really does feel like meeting up with an old friend. The character himself is just as honest and done to Earth as ever, showing Stallone understands his own creation better than anyone else. So how do we make a Rocky film emotionally engaging right off the bat 16 years after the last movie? Have it revealed that Adrian died at some unspecified point (before 1995 at least) and that he is emotionally distant from his son along with a sprinkle of nostalgia in showing that he still has pet turtles (so are they the same turtles from the first movie?). Rocky Balboa doesn't draw too heavily on little nods to the previous movies but a few are there. Rocky revisiting his old haunts really puts his journey in retrospect as he looks back on the ghosts of the past. More drastically however, Rocky Balboa breaks the series tradition and has no recap of the final fight from the previous movie, setting itself up as its own separate beast.In Rocky Balboa, the titular character is doing well for himself at least in terms of his standing in the community and even operates a restaurant named after his late wife. The real difficulty Rocky currently has in his life is the strained relationship with his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia). Robert is ultimately a bit of a snob who is more intellectual than his father and works in a modern, geometric building (the Cira Centre); a world where the street weary Rocky doesn't belong. Robert is clearly bothered by his father and doesn't want to live in his shadow and only get ahead because of his last name. There is even a reference to the father-son relationship in Rocky V when Rocky uses the phrase ""Home Team"" to his son. See Stallone, even you can't deny it exists (he actually gave the film a rating of ""0"" on a British talk show)Like previous films in the series, Rocky Balboa draws comparisons to Stallone's own life. The scene in which Rocky tries to convince the boxing commission to grant him a license feels just like Stallone trying to pitch the movie itself to a group of Hollywood executives; and it's true that Stallone didn't have an easy time making Rocky VI. Even the reactions within the movie to the fight's announcement echo the reaction to the movie's announcement (""Rocky the President has labeled you a Balboasaurus""). I appreciate films about old age as they are few and far between (excluding Lifetime movies). - You can't teach an old dog new tricks? Nonsense!One of the weakest aspects of Rocky Balboa in my book is the largely forgettable opponent Mason 'The Line' Dixon. He is not over the top like Rocky's previous foes and has no definable personality, memorable lines and has an RBF throughout the entire film. A more subdue villain could be interesting if done right but the script makes no attempt to do so. Honestly, his managers are far more interesting as a group of cynical, greedy boxing promoters. Although my biggest gripe with Rocky Balboa is the film's visual appearance. The cinematography is way too overexposed and there is way too much blue in the colour scheme; I had to adjust my eyes in order to get used to it. - I will say Creed is far more visually asserting movie.Burt Young makes Paulie grouchy and grumpy as ever and gives his best performance as the character, well in a deleted scene that is in which Paulie breaks down after losing his job after 31 years and speaks of how much he misses his sister. This has me screaming, ""why wasn't this left in the film?!"" I get scenes have to be sacrificed for pacing but could they have not squeezed this scene in there? Oh well, that's all part of filmmaking. Bringing back the character of Marie on the other hand, a one scene character from the first film is one of the best aspects of Rocky Balboa. I actually was fortunate enough to not know this going into the film and her reveal was a huge gasp moment. Likewise, the relationship between Rocky and Marie's stepson named, well Steps presents an endearing generational difference. Rocky Balboa carries on what simply makes the Rocky films superb - great characters. Plus as with the rest of the series, there are many inspirational lines which I can add to my Rocky lexicon (""It ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you get hit""). Even Duke's ""hurting bombs"" monologue may be his greatest line ever, and that's saying a lot.The final fight in Rocky Balboa (which itself was inspired by a 1994 bout between a 45-year-old George Forman and a 26-year-old Michael Moorer) comes about because of a computer fight on ESPN. A ""what if"" scenario in which a computer determines who would win a fight between two contenders from different time periods; the premise sounds ridiculous on paper but surprisingly it actually works. The fight is by far the most realistic in the series up until that point. Thankfully the strive for realism doesn't make the fight any less exciting than previous Rocky bouts. The fight is presented like it's the real thing; it's live on HBO, stats appear on the screen, its shot in HD and Michael Buffer is the presenter. The fight does transition from the live broadcast to a traditional movie presentation with some effective use of colouring in the black & white shotsRocky Balboa is not my favourite film the series but how many franchises can say the 6th installment was this good. Where it certainly does succeed is in leaving the viewer with that uplifting Rocky feeling. In the final shot, Rocky visits Adrian's grave and walks into the background disappearing into thin air, implying he's passed on, or so we thought...",Rocky Balboa

Jeez, no realism in it at all, but it was just like all the other Rocky movie fights, so you can't call Sly inconsistent but you can call him not very creative.Aside from that really phony-looking fight, the movie before the fight was pretty satisfying in the same heartfelt way the original Rocky was, as it mostly showed an older and genial, but sadly humble Rocky now working the tables at his little Italian(what else?)restaurant telling worn out boxing adventures to adoring customers, and then quietly visiting his dead wife's grave. Alcoholic brother-in-law Paulie(Burt Young)is still alive and still nipping from his bottle of rye, but Rocky's adored Adrian has died. The barely adequate young actor playing their son must have accepted less money for the job than anyone more closely resembling Sly, because Sly certainly could have found a closer image of himself instead of the disappointingly wimpy and scrawny kid he hired who played his son as an uncaring little yuppie jerk more interested in being a big shot in business than being a good son to a worn out old pug, even with all his boxing fame. (Why not use Stallone's real son?) But, the two come together in the end, as we all knew they would. Every scene was so predictable, but weren't all Rocky-movie scenes that way? As I said, earlier...very consistent movie-making if not very creatively original.Just a very simple underdog tale done by Sly for the 6th time(or is it the 66th time?), but a better one to finish with than any of the other sequels before it. Let's just hope he's done now, but this is the same Sly who has gone to the same well so many times before that it is possible you might see a Rocky 100 before he quits. And, I read that Sly's got Rambo 10 or so ready to go! Save us all.",Rocky Balboa
142,OMTR,To see and to meditate!,10,13 March 2019,"Rocky Balboa is a brilliant and touching analysis of the long struggle of life. It is a lesson in courage and self-sacrifice. It's a cry from the heart, in the name of love, respect and will: ""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward."" Simply fantastic, beautiful, magical!
This sixth episode in the Rocky saga is perfectly written and all actors play the part to the pinnacle of perfection. The powerful, famous and magnificent music of Bill Conti perfectly underlines the emotions of a cleverly orchestrated plot. Rocky Balboa is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of the 2000s and beyond, and there is no category in which it did not deserve to win an Oscar.
Rocky is fighting in the name of love, for those he loves and those who love him, giving a lesson of respect that is the best example that we can give to (young) people.
Sylvester Stallone, and his alter-ego Rocky Balboa, have come full circle by completing a great journey that began 30 years before, winning the hearts and the appreciation of the spectators of the whole world thanks to their RESPECT, LOVE, HUMANITY, COURAGE, INTEGRITY, INTELLIGENCE and WISDOM! These are the character traits of Rocky, and Sylvester Stallone who is a great author: writer, actor and director.",Rocky Balboa
143,TheHonestCritic,"This is the ending to the iconic ""Rocky"" movie saga. Does it end with a total knockout?",10,2 November 2020,"""Rocky Balboa"" (2006), back when this film was announced, it was definitely unexpected. I was very shocked to hear about it, because ""Rocky V"" (1990) was supposed to be the last one. At first, I was worried that it was going to be a reboot or remake. But, when I found out that Sylvester Stallone was going to play Rocky, it finally sparked my interest. Now, I didn't go and see it in a theater, I just waited to get it on DVD. It was worth the wait, and then some! ""Rocky Balboa"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline, in some ways, is kind of like a retelling of the first film. Rocky now runs a local Italian restaurant called ""Adrian's"", named after his late wife. That really surprised me, finding out that the character Adrian died between ""Rocky V"" and this movie! Now, Rocky is back to square one. His wife's passing adds just the right amount of emotional baggage to motivate Rocky to keep pushing on and to never give up. A lot of times, endings to movie series try to include callbacks to previous films and fall flat due to not being it's own original movie itself. However, ""Rocky Balboa"" is one of those rare films that gets it 100% right. Every callback is included in such a creative way that it just adds to the plot and hits all the proper emotional notes. I do have one little nitpick, and it really is just a nitpick. There is a deleted scene with Rocky and Paulie mourning the loss of Adrian. That scene, to be honest, is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen. I didn't cry, but I felt my eyes water a little bit. To this day, I'm astonished that they deleted that scene! It could have made the movie even better than it already is. But, I guess that you could argue that it slows down the story. However, I don't think it slows down the film in any sense of the word. It would have given Rocky an extra boost to persuade him to prepare for his boxing match. Now, the scene being deleted doesn't hurt the movie in any way, like I said, it's just a nitpick. The plot line is just as strong regardless, whether that scene is in it or not. Bottom line the storyline for this film is masterfully written and expressed. One other thing that I really want to point out, is the motivational speech that Rocky gives his son. That, in my opinion, is one of my top 10 all-time favorite speeches given in any film, or in general. It certainly hits home! As for the acting, what more can I say? It's just as phenomenal as in the previous movies. All of the actors and actresses definitely help bring their respectable characters and the film itself to life. Of course, Sylvester Stallone as Rocky is the shining star, Burt Young is stellar as Paulie, Antonio Tarver is great as Rocky's opponent, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon and Geraldine Hughes is fantastic as Marie. That's right, we get to see Little Marie again. Although, in this movie, she's not ""Little"" Marie anymore! In the first film, Little Marie was originally played by Jodi Letizia, but in this movie, she's portrayed by Geraldine Hughes. Truthfully, she does just as good a job as a grown up Jodi Letizia would have done with the role. Fun fact: there's a deleted scene in ""Rocky V"" where it shows Little Marie homeless and on the street. That was a smart move deleting that scene, as it would have been kind of disrespectful to her character. In this film, it shows her growing up and having a decent job, which was a good character arc. Plus, Rocky and Marie's friendship grows throughout the film and it was a nice touch to the story. Another different cast member from the original in this movie is that Milo Ventimiglia plays Rocky's son; Rocky Jr. Sage Stallone, who is Sylvester Stallone's real son, played him originally (R.I.P.) However, Milo does just as good a job in the role as Sage did. He and Sylvester Stallone have great chemistry on-screen and I'd buy them being father and son immediately. All of the sets/locations are perfect, and give this film such a fantastic atmosphere. You cannot go wrong filming your movie in Philadelphia! As far as special effects go, there aren't that many. But, any special effects that are used are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of exemplary. Most of you probably know already that Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and this soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. Props to you, Bill Conti, for sticking with the ""Rocky"" franchise since the beginning! More importantly, why don't we thank Sylvester Stallone and the supporting actors for staying loyal to the ""Rocky"" franchise. We appreciate all of your hard work! Too bad the ""Creed"" films had to taint the world with their existence though. But, those will be two different film reviews for another time. ""Rocky Balboa"" is a cinematic triumph and one of the best endings to any movie saga. I can watch it over and over again and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. Well, we have finished up the ""Rocky"" saga. It was fun to write these movie reviews! The ""Rocky"" series is one of my all-time favorite film sagas. If you haven't seen ""Rocky Balboa"", or any of the other five films, go see them today. Or, Rocky will knock you out! After finally wrapping up this iconic movie saga, all I have to say is, quoting Rocky himself: ""yo, Adrian, we did it!""",Rocky Balboa
144,PeterRoeder,Great movie,7,8 January 2007,"I had not slept all night and had a cold when I saw this movie today in my hometown. Therefore from the first couple of minutes I found myself crying because of the heavy emotions this movie evokes. It is a really brilliant sequel to the first rocky. one might disagree, I do, with some of the way it portrays American life, but it is really a brilliant movie about several emotions and views of life. still it is exposing the American mentality of ruthlessness and winning at any cost. Most viciously portrayed when rocky is down in the second round and his ""girlfriend"" yells ""get up"".... eh? perhaps it would have been OK to stay down? but not in America of course... where you have to live in an orwellian 1984 nightmare these days i guess...",Rocky Balboa
145,CelluloidRehab,"Hey, Tommy !! I didn't hear no bell.......",6,12 June 2007,"This is a segue into a tangent from Commando.We can only hope, at this point, that Sylvester Stallone has heard the final bell and will be retiring Rocky. It is safe to bet that this is the last Rocky movie. The only exceptions would include 1) Sylvester Stallone as producer/director/writer but not actor; 2)Stallone in a cameo role (a Rocky movie where the namesake of the movie is a cameo role is either sheer madness or sheer brilliance) or 3) Sylvester Stallone in Rocky Ho-tep. Bruce Campbell as Sylvester Stallone, might work, with the right script. Maybe Rocky could fight Apollo Creed-Zombie? So in light of the above, this is the farewell of one Rocky Balboa. The first movie was the introduction of the blue collar, Philadelphia everyman of Rocky Balboa, who got to live out the ""American Dream"". It is the quintessential sports movie, yet it isn't and even still, is much more. The second movie is in my opinion the worst of the series because it is essentially the first movie with a happy ending. It did have Rocky reading out loud and learning to read, which is funny. The third and fourth movies are products of the 1980's. Like the 80's, they are a bit gaudy, self involved, bright and very, very hyper (sniff here please). Also Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has been replaced by Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). After returning from abroad, the fifth movie is essentially Rocky down and out in South Philadelphia. We get back to Rocky's roots and to his legacy. This movie fits very nicely in this chronology.This movie basically mirrors or is parallel to the first movie in everything except time. We return to all the people and places (that still remain) from his youth. There are some differences. Adrian is now sleeping with Apollo Creed. She's dead Jim!! No Talia, No Problem!! Paulie gets into the action by getting fired and becoming an angry drunk in the process. Rocky even manages a disturbingly uneasy pseudo-relationship with a woman that could be his daughter, in a Gump sort of way. Rocky, himself, has turned into a Forrest-Gump-Spouting philosophical slab of aged and tenderized beef. He has his own restaurant, in which he walks around and entertains the patrons in true Mickey Mantle-like style. His relations are still strained with his son from the previous movie. This time around even Stallone's son did not want to replay Rocky's son (see Sage Stallone). Rocky (and/or Stallone by proxy) has not aged well. Rocky has become a prime example of too much steroid use and the recipient of too many blows to the head. If he didn't walk around, he could have been mistaken for an animatronic wax statue at Madame Tussauds. In all honesty, the first time I saw this movie I couldn't help but feel as if this was trying to be a caricature of itself. Stallone's leathery skin and speech is enough to scare anyone into a laugh. There is a point where that changes. It took just one little speech to change it. I loved the speech Rocky gives to his son about life as not being how hard you could hit, but about how many hits you could take and keep going. Up to this point, the movie had been a comical look at Rocky. To be quite honest, all of the Rocky movies, with the exception of the first, have had thick layers of ham and cheese, inducing laughter in the process. Even though Rocky is older, doesn't mean he is any less funny. The speech epitomizes Rocky and salvages the movie. The best part is that the actual fight is not the crescendo climax of the movie. This is the first Rocky movie in which his opponent is unimportant and unimpressive. Rocky's opponent isn't Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), but time itself. The moment the bell rings is both the triumph, victory and end of Rocky. It was the speech, however, that allowed me to see this movie a second time, for perspective. The second time around wasn't as funny, yet it still worked. It proves this isn't a one-trick pony sent to the glue factory. It isn't the best in the series, but it is a good send off for an icon. Hopefully, he stays there.",Rocky Balboa
146,bluesman-20,Rocky Balboa's last stand,10,23 March 2008,"Rocky Balboa is a good idea wonderfully executed Stallone hits all the right notes here filling us in on all the history from the time that Rocky V ended until now. Adrian is dead And Rocky has opened up a restaurant called Adrians. The idea was inspired by Jack Dempsey I suppose? Rocky is happy but something is wrong his wife is dead his son and him are estranged and things just don't seem the same. A computer fight between him and the Current Champion Mason THE LINE Dixon creates a interest in returning to go back to fighting. The Champion whose ratings are slipping hears about Rocky Returning to fighting gives him a Shot at the Champion, While it's only a Exhibation and not a Title match everyone is treating it as one and all Rocky wants to do is go the distance. Rocky finds romance and self respect during his quest to come back as a fighter. Well Worth the 17 year wait. Stallone has said this is it this is the last Rocky and I can see why but if Stallone was honest with himself it should not be the end of Rocky Balboa he can always find other ways for Rocky to get back in the ring or to come to the aid of some other fighter just look at George Foreman or Archie Moore Their Careers didn't end when they retired they just moved on to the next level. Imagine the George Foreman story filmed as Rocky 7 there is alway possibilities but if the series must end. It ended on a high note and in a very Classy manner.",Rocky Balboa
147,Coffee_in_the_Clink,A hands-on approach from Stallone makes this a faithful and satisfying comeback,7,30 June 2021,"Stallone put everything into this film, bringing Rocky back to the screen after a fifteen year absence since ""Rocky V"". He said himself that he was not too happy with the conclusion to the series, and in ""Rocky Balboa"" he not only stars in the lead but he writes, directs and is one of the producers. Balboa's comeback is a fierce and relentless film, full of the old glory but stinging with a fitting melancholy as Rocky adjusts to life in the aftermath of Adrian's death, and longs for the glory days. He still hangs around with Paulie, has an estranged relationship with his son, and he has a burning desire in his gut to reclaim the past. So when he is tempted into the ring by Mason Dixon, the reigning and undisputed heavyweight champion of the world - who now has no more challengers and his hated by boxing fans - Rocky gets back into the ring and trains to make his comeback, at the ripe-old age of 60 or so.Stallone is incredible. He is in serious shape here and I think that his work behind the camera is understated. He is a great director. It was a brave move bringing Rocky back after fifteen years. It really could have gone either way, but Stallone knows Rocky inside and out and the work was really put in for the fight scenes - as you'd expect. A fine comeback.",Rocky Balboa
148,flicklover,A fitting apology for Rocky 5!!!,9,28 December 2006,"Late last year when it was being reported that Sly would bring Rocky back, I was cautiously optimistic. The jokes were flying around , people we're almost hoping that this film would be horrible. Now, after Rocky 5, I can understand that sentiment. The first Rocky is the only truly great movie of the series. But with the exception of Rocky 5, I enjoy the sequels. Here Stallone does the unexpected. He focuses most of the film on character, and much less on training montages and fight scenes.As even the trailer suggests, Rocky has lost his beloved Adrian. He feels lost and alone and really has only his memories of her to sustain him. I truly wish that he would've brought Talia Shire in for a scene or 2. They had a good chemistry. We only see her in brief, silent flashback images. Rocky spends the first part of the film saddened over her passing. The scenes where he expresses his pain work for the most part. Stallone has one scene that I would say does his best acting ever.The fighting aspect takes a back seat here. He is lured into fighting an exhibition fight with the current Heavyweight Champion, Mason Dixon. Played well by Anthony Tarver. The Dixon character is also very different from other Rocky villain/opponents in that he isn't portrayed as a villain. He is a good fighter that doesn't have the respect of the media and fans. They claim that he fights average opponents. Rocky decides to take the fight, wanting to get rid of his ""inner beast"" as he tells his brother in law Paulie.There are many things that I wish Stallone would have cut or fleshed out. There is a relationship with a girl that he helped when she was a kid. She has a boy that he tries to befriend. The relationship is done superficially, and doesn't work. Also, there is the conflict with Rocky's son. Also could have used more screen time.Last, but not least there is Paulie. The one character that has stayed with Rocky thru all the films. Burt Young has played him differently in each film. He was a jealous, angry but loyal friend to Rocky in the first film. And gradually he became comic relief in subsequent sequels. Here he is a mix of both. Pauley is also mourning his sister, but he wants to avoid it, he feels guilty about how he treated her when she was alive. He has a couple very good,heartbreaking scenes.I think that it might have been better if Stallone would've handed the directing to someone else, to tighten the story a little more. The bottom line is that though there are misses in the film, but the when the punch hits, it lands very well. I believe that the film will win back many fans that hated Rocky 5. I think that is Sly's target audience. As much as I agree that Rocky 5 was a mess I don't dislike it as much as others do. Sylvester Stallone was playing Rocky in the last film. It did seem that he had a beat on the character anymore. With thus film Sly is back to being Rocky Balboa.I had to smile when I heard ""Gonna Fly Now"" in the training sequence. It is a familiar and welcome theme. The audience in the theater seemed to be into it. Stallone with this film got back to what I think made us like the character in the first place. Not that he was going to win the fight, but that he was fallable, very human character.The fight itself is well done, but it is not the spectacle that we had gotten used to in the other films. Stallone underplays the whole boxing element, and that as it turns out is refreshing. He filmed the fight as if it were a sports telecast. By the end of the fight he achieves what I think is a fitting farewell to an iconic film character.Whether you like Sylvester Stallone or not, he has created an iconic character that has been with us for forty years.Grade: B+",Rocky Balboa
149,barberoux,Maudlin same old.,5,9 January 2007,"If you liked the previous ""Rocky"" movies you'll like this one. If you didn't this one won't change your mind. In fact it is the same old story over again with the same characters, though some played by other people. The first Rocky had a sort of charm and personality that was appealing and likable but after all of the lousy sequels and the repetition of the same old maudlin story over and over I was sick of it. I went to see this final, I hope, movie after hearing some good press about it but I was disappointed. I did not like it. I'm from Philadelphia and I enjoyed seeing the shots of the city but the characters were such a bunch of whiny, depressed losers that I couldn't wait until the whole thing was over. The fight scene was OK but not in the least believable. I thought the movie focused too much on Rocky and did not develop any of the other characters. Geraldine Hughes was decent but not given too much to do. The story was way, way too maudlin for me.",Rocky Balboa

Rocky Balboa it is the final sixth movie in the Rocky franchise. For me this movie ended the franchise perfectly well. Sly stated after this movie he is done with Rocky. He always wanted to do this movie, but he never had a time and the quality script for the story until in the early 2000's when his career was over. He dicede to make another Rocky and Rambo sequel.
Rocky Balboa is my fourth personal favorite Rocky movie and Stallone movie of all time.This is my final Rocky review, I am not reviewing Creed I hate that movie to death. The best one in the franchise I ever saw I love, I love this movie to death. It is a final Rocky film it goes back to the roots and mostly it is continuation from the first original movie.""Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!""When he loses a highly publicized virtual boxing match to ex-champ Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), reigning heavyweight title holder Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) retaliates by challenging The Italian Stallion to a nationally televised, 10-round exhibition bout. To the suprises of his son (Milo Ventimiglia) and his brother-in law Paulie (Burt Young). Rocky agrees to come out of retirement and face an opponent who's faster, stronger and thirty years his junior. With the odds stacked firmly against him. Rocky takes on Dixon in what will become the greatest fight in boxing history, a hard-hitting, action- packed battle of the ages!Back in my high school years I think it was in 2004 - 05 I read an article, that Sly is planing to make another Rocky movie. Which it is going to be based on George Foreman's life in the 90's who come back out of retirement. I did not believe in this movie I said it is cool I am really wondering how the movie will look like. Until it was released in 2006 and I watch it next year. I love this film to death this to me is a clasisc action sports drama. Slyvester Stallone, Burt Young and Tony Burton reprise their roles. Sylvester Stallone proved once again that he is the champion of the whole world. He is a talent and awesome actor of all time. I love Rocky Balboa character in this movie. Burt Young's best awesome performence as Paulie love him in this movie I am glad Sly put him in this film. New cast Milo Ventimiglia as Robert Balboa did a good job, much better acting performence than Sage Stallone. Geraldine Hughes as Little Marie did a good job playing the character I don't know why the original actress Jodi Letizia from the first Rocky did not appear as Marie in this movie. Antonio Tarver a real life boxer was a bad-ass Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. The guy kick ass, Mike Tyson was in this movie he had a cameo scene.Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Tarver held up filming of the fight scene and demanded a higher salary. He refused to start filming until he was guaranteed more money. Stallone gave up a large part of his own salary and paid it to Tarver.I love the training sequnce, music score from Bill Conti. The fight in the finale Rocky vs Dixon is is for real many people think this is better movie than all Rocky sequels. In my opinion the first Rocky fight and this fight are very realistic. I love Rocky having a dog and you see him running with his beautiful dog up stairs middle of the snow. I love showing people end of credits running the stairs. Million of us love Rocky to death there are so manny of us fans about Rocky Balboa character. You even see girls cheering for Rocky. ""It's already over. There ain't nothin' over 'til it's over. What's that from, the '80s? That's probably the '70s."" I love the script Sly wrote a beautiful script and he beautiful directed this movie. It is a different original than last movies that's what I wanted to see in next Rocky movie.There was this girl in a bar who come at Rocky pretending to be his fan and try to convince him, to buy her and her friends a drink. That was a real incident in Stallone's biography in 1982 on a production set ""First Blood"" a girl try to convince Sly to buy her a drink.I love, love the soundtrack It's a Fight by by Three 6 Mafia. This is the real Rocky, it is different from the first four, but it is inspirational. I don't know why Rocky (1976) and Rocky Balboa (2006) vere remastered on Blu-ray disc but not Rocky II, III and IV. This is the real and last Rocky movie it ended perfectly. Creed (2015) sucks that movie is a disgrace to this sport and any Rocky movie! Creed is god awful trash cash grab movie and I don't care about those 2 garbage movies.Rocky Balboa kicks-ass it is one of my personal favorite sports movies I love, love this film dearly to death.

153,luke-a-mcgowan,The most implausible and forgettable one yet,4,25 February 2016,"My biggest flaw with Rocky Balboa, and the reason I could not get into it like I did with all the previous films, was that a) it is somehow even more implausible than Rocky ending the Cold War (more on that later) and b) I don't understand how Rocky suddenly became such old news in this universe. In real life, a society where the fictional Rocky Balboa is synonymous with sporting prowess, we're expected to believe that the real life Balboa has not only been forgotten, but is now derided across the board. Drunks in bars tell him that he's no better than they are – does Stallone really think we'd go up to Muhammad Ali and tell him that? No one in the entire movie besides the characters in Rocky's corner seem to have any respect for him and I just can't understand why.Rocky Balboa opens on an overly sentimental note as Rocky goes through the yearly mourning rituals since the death of Adrian. I imagine that this would have hit fans very hard in 2006, but now, in 2015, having seen it done more tastefully in Creed, I found is sappy and overdone. Stallone's emotional delivery does much to salvage what I'm not buying from the writing, but for the most part it strays too close to Rocky 4's montage of memories.Rocky is a lovable old man in this movie, but he doesn't feel like Rocky. He's not the sweet bumbling boxer we knew in Rockys 1, 2 and 5, nor is he the emotionally devastating man we knew in Creed. He's sort of just there. Paulie is much the same and rehashes his best moments from Rocky 4 and Rocky 5 without adding more to the table. Robert adds more conflict to the movie that gets resolved quickly and ends up crowding out Steps, another character who becomes redundant pretty quickly when Stallone gets distracted. I found the addition of Little Marie played by Geraldine Hughes to be a nice addition, a platonic but special relationship for Rocky to treasure in this one with Adrian absent. The saddest thing about Rocky Balboa is that it has the most forgettable characters of the entire franchise. Rocky films have classic character roles – the trainer, the love interest, the opponent, the protégé, the opponent's trainer – but Steps, Mason Dixon and all the other characters introduced in this movie belong at the bottom of the long list of Rocky characters. Mason ""The Line"" Dixon manages to be the most forgettable of Rocky's opponents, with no personality whatsoever. They give him an undercooked attempt at character development, but it adds nothing and the film wouldn't have changed without it.The premise of the fight is utterly stupid. Balboa's reasons for wanting to fight are stupid, weak and unrealistic. The decision to give him a boxing license is laughable. The end result is insane – Balboa had to be half carried out when he defeated Creed, but here he just strolls out. I know it was an exhibition match but those punches looked hard during the match. While the atmosphere is great with good camera-work, sound and music, the implausibility of the fight – a 50 year old former champ vs the current heavyweight champion – is too much to overcome.Now that we have Creed on our hands I hope that Rocky Balboa will age and diminish. It is a lesser conclusion to the franchise than Creed, it is a lesser film than Rocky V. Now that I have seen the whole franchise, I must say that people's love for Rocky Balboa and hatred of Rocky V are misplaced – they should most definitely be switched around. Can I please give half a star to the massive, fat black chick who ghetto dances at the top of the Phili steps in the credits? It's the most entertaining 2 seconds of the movie.",Rocky Balboa
154,ReelCheese,Stallone Makes Us Believers -- Again,10,31 March 2007,"Admit it. The first time you heard this movie was being made, you either laughed or cringed. On the surface, the concept of a sixth ROCKY film is one of the most ludicrous in recent memory. A brain-damaged boxer who hasn't fought in two decades comes out of retirement in his 50s? To take on the Heavyweight champ? Come on.But just as The Italian Stallion has one fight left in him, it turns out that writer-director-star Sylvestor Stallone still has the talent to produce top-quality entertainment. We pick up with Rocky in contemporary times, now running a quaint little restaurant called Adrian's, named after his beloved late wife. His relationship with uptight son Robert is awkward, and his life is filled with reflections on years gone by. After a computer-simulated boxing match suggests a young Rocky would defeat current boxing champ Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the 50-something decides to climb into the ring again. He plans to headline small-time local fights for thrills, but Dixon's managers soon propose an exhibition charity match of ""Will Vs Skill"" between the two men. And so the stage is set for the final (and most unlikely) match of Rock's career.What's most amazing about ROCKY BALBOA is that again Stallone makes us believers. Just as we believed that at wash-up from the streets of Philly could take the boxing crown from Apollo Creed all those years ago, we believe he can stand toe-to-toe with Dixon. Stallone doesn't gloss over the unlikeliness of the storyline. The boxing commission initially rejects his application, for seemingly obvious reasons. Reporters chide the fight as a sort of circus-like event that hurts boxing. Dixon's champion status is watered down by the fact he has been spoon-fed weak opponents his whole career, didn't seem to take the Balboa match seriously, and injures his hand early in the fight. It all gives the film a very real feel, as unlikely as it may sound.ROCKY BALBOA is also a very fresh take on a character we've grown to love. The film has a very gritty, contemporary look. Rocky's old neighborhood isn't quite the same place where men used to sing in perfect harmony around a barrel fire. Now it's filled with decrepit buildings and obnoxious young people who remind you of the guests who go on Jerry Springer and swear at the audience. The Rocky here is a man out of his time who can hardly be blamed for his desire to seek out past glories. At the same time, ROCKY BALBOA has high nostalgia value. Whether you like the film or not, it's a real treat to see Rocky, still with his pork pie hat, back when we were sure we'd never see him again. Paulie's back, too, still drunk most of the time, and former Creed trainer Duke once again gets the most out of his man in the ring.ROCKY BALBOA is first class entertainment. Like the original entry, it's not really a boxing movie, but a film about the human condition and following our dreams. It's fantastic.",Rocky Balboa

Is it good? The answer is yes. Balboa is a fitting conclusion to the series. While again it is somewhat sentimental, it is a film about love, friendship and determination.Stallone's performance is not bad. In fact it is quite effective at times as an ageing boxer, a widower, who once again returns for one fight, one more experience of that thrilling ring he has fought so many times before.Rocky Balboa: You know I couldn't have done nothing without you... Yo Adrian we did it...7/10",Rocky Balboa
156,RealLiveClaude,A good conclusion for a legendary pop hero...,9,23 December 2006,"At least, Sylvester Stallone did risk all to bring back his signature role. If we remember Rocky V, he not only left the directing to John A.Avildsen, who directed the first one, but left us with a disappointing end to a saga in which we did enjoy despite flaws (however, in my words, ROCKY did deserve its Academy Award in 1976 !).It's a trip to nostalgia, to where Rocky did really have its roots in Philadelphia. However, when you rely on your past (this continuous mourning about his late wife Adrian...) you can't go nowhere. But there is always a spark somewhere that brings you back where you were and go the distance again. This time, Rocky decides to fight an unpopular and arrogant boxing champ after seeing a computer simulation on national TV. On his way, he must cope first with his son, then befriends an unexpected person, a woman whom he tried to turn good when she was a kid some 30 years back...At least, Stallone is back on top of his game...and finally goes the distance. Hopefully, this is a satisfying end to one of the best underdog saga ever done by a actor/director...ROCKY ! ROCKY ! ROCKY !",Rocky Balboa
157,jerekra,Thank God they made this movie.,10,3 September 2008,"Thank God they made this movie. After the debacle that was Rocky Five Stallone knew that he had to end the series a different way. I give him the utmost respect and also I give him mad props for making Rocky Balboa so great and also for being willing to admit that Rocky Five was a failure.Rocky Balboa starts off with Rocky visiting Adrian's grave. Apparently she died (interesting way to start the film.) Rocky visits his son at work and there apparently is still some dissension between father and son.Rocky has opened a restaurant called ""Adrian's"" and spends a lot of time there. Paulie still hangs around with Rocky and gets upset with Rocky for dwelling on his past memories with Adrian and for living backwards.Rocky also meets up with a much older little Marie (yes the same little Marie from the first film who told Rocky ""Screw You Creepo.) THey begin to hang around with each other and Rocky befriends Marie's son.Rocky is presented with an opportunity to fight the heavyweight champion of the world Mason DIxon in an exhibition game. This is mainly due to the fact that ESPN made a computer simulated fight between Dixon and Rocky and Rocky won. Rocky considers this a great opportunity to do something that he loves once again much to the disapproval of his son. His son eventually changes his view and helps Rocky train along with Duke, (Apollo and Rocky's old trainer) Paulie, and Marie's son.Rocky then gets into the ring for the last time(probably not though) against Dixon.This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. I guess I did not have high expectations for this film and this film definitely surprised me with how good it is. In tone, style, and acting this film is nearly as good as the original.I like the story. Rocky is old and a widower. He seems to have lost his zest for life. True he is running a restaurant in honor of Adrian but he always is a fighter and without boxing a major part of his life is missing. So the idea of him returning to the ring was awesome. Rocky fighting in the ring is awesome. Just thinking about the fight in this film makes me get goosebumps with how awesome it was done. THe ring fights are what make the Rocky series so memorable and I think that the fight in this film easily is the second best of the entire series after the first fight with Apollo.Stallone puts in another great performance as Rocky. He really portrays Rocky well considering the character in this film. He really acted like a guy who lost his wife and seemed to be missing something to keep him going. And the training scene in this film was well done again. Loved the speech that Duke gave to Rocky before he started training.There was one particular scene that I thought was well done in general. Rocky is talking to Marie's son about an old dog that seems to be out of it. But Rocky makes the statement that if the dog gets back up on its feet, makes some new friends, and do things again that it will be back. Loved this part because Rocky feels like this dog and is no doubt speaking about himself as well. Just a well done scene that stuck out to me for some reason.The ring fight is well done since it looks like a real fight that would be on TV. THe scene where they show Rocky on ESPN fighting Dixon and then hearing what the boxing analysts said about him was pretty good. Hearing Skipp Bayless rip on Rocky sounded realistic because it seems like Skipp would hate on Rocky.The music is like the Music from the first film, which is good. The music goes well with a few flashback scenes at the beginning.So overall this movie is great. ANy true Rocky Fan would love this film. It is not as good as the first Rocky but I think it is just as good as Rocky two, three, and four (and way better than five, but that goes without saying.) I am so glad they made this film. Now they do not have to make another Rocky film, but if they did I hope they make it like this.Go see it. I recommend it to everyone.",Rocky Balboa

Talia Shire was a brilliant part of all the previous films. As the story rolled on I realized that it wasn't really all about boxing and was more about family and friendship. We see a young boxer vying to be noticed and eventually Rocky agrees to fight him in the usual crowd/viewer pleasing scenario. Great to see Paulie back in his dry, acerbic humorous self too. This film is a bit of an achievement for a now 60 year old Sylvester Stallone. Really enjoyable and right up there with some of the other better Rocky movies",Rocky Balboa

Rocky Balboa starts out sleepy and slow, but you quickly accept the setting of this tone, as it mirrors the grayness at that point in Rocky's life.The movie pummels you with such down-to-earth jabs of wisdom that can't help but stick to you. In one scene, Rocky says in his simple, unassuming way, ""Ya know they always say if you live in one place long enough, you are that place,"" and you can't help but relate to that; you automatically reflect on where you currently are in your life.When his son Rocky Jr., now in the corporate world, insecurely says, ""You cast a big shadow,"" Rocky counters with advice, filled with all the frustrated love he has for his son: ""Let me tell you something you already know: The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit, and not point fingers saying you ain't where you are because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!"" Rocky waxes nostalgic for the better part of the film, but you allow him this; he gets the respect he deserves through and through. Even current champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon says at the final round of their match, ""You're a crazy old man."" Rocky Balboa wisely replies, ""Don't worry you'll get there."" He finds his match in a now grown-up Li'l Marie, who matches his views, ""It doesn't matter how this looks to other people. If this is something you gotta do, then you do it. Fighters fight."" While the actual final fight felt hurried through the rounds, all in all Rocky Balboa is a great film everyone will be able to relate to: having peaked and realizing you want more, the unpredictability of life, and how we should all relish what we've got while we have them.",Rocky Balboa
161,buzznzipp1995,The Final 'exhibition' battle...Amen,10,23 August 2007,"I feel in light of the past performances, that this was a heart-felt rendering. Movies not unlike paintings can be viewed again, and should be by all standards, whether good great, or poor. There was a sense with this last installment, that Stallone gave off with Balboa's character, that had respect and was real. He stood in the shadow of his past, a humbled man not forgetting where he had come and for whom he loved, (family and friends). He both grieved and believed in his wife who had passed away. She was a defining factor in his life and heavy-weight career. Adriane stood by him and was often afraid for him and angry at what she thought the 'sport' was doing to her husband. I watched with both doubt and hope at first, on this story. Since there was a five and it was a reel-bomber of a situation for his character, I feel that there was not a real foundation for the Balboa character to stand or build on, but rather a 1990-MTV styled child-like script work. In the final chapter for our character, I feel that he couldn't move onto a place of outstanding victory as he had in the previous set. All in all there is no doubt that he had something worth rooting for, in the 2006 movie. This for me (since there is always someone to disagree) single handedly brought back the dignity that had been brutally executed in the precluding, some 16 years earlier.Stallone should be congratulated for his efforts despite the years of age on him and the wave of adversity from the original producer and Sylvester's long time friend in the business. There some big odds to overcome first. Someone on the outside of that business may think, who cares? But it is quite an undertaking to push and finally make it through to the place of success, when you have the deck stacked against your age and so on.My 'eval' and recommendation is for Rocky Balboa (2006), This is the comeback kid's overcoming moment of glory only with longstanding effects. It is also a warm heart-felt story of never giving up in what dreams you have. Enjoyed fully (****)",Rocky Balboa

This is a modern gem, one that teaches us and inspires us to keep moving forward and not get beaten by anyone. A stunning performance that shows us that life ain't about how hard you hit its about you having the guts to keep going... and that the last thing to age on somebody is their heart. That's the most important motivational lesson we can absorb from this gem. Because that's what we are all afraid.... old age... But Rocky shows us that standing still is even worse. No excuses!

It was wonderful, there were clichés and there wasn't, I thought it was wonderful, the sense of spirit which is what it should be all about. I definitely support the message in this movie. I heard Stallone is doing Rambo again too, God knows but the opportunities with that could be more than superb if he carries out the message he carried here which predictably I believe he will and he should.

It was that way when the original came out in the 70's, and it's still that way today! Rocky is, what one of the boxing analysts of the film call, an 'ex-ex-ex champ' and it really doesn't matter to him...until he feels that something is missing, and decides to return to the ring, but not on the scale he used to be.Along comes Mason 'The Line' Dixon, who needs a PR boost as far as his image is concerned, and what better way to get in the ring with a legend? This film reminds me of George Forman years ago, climbing back into the ring, but, if memory serves, he wasn't as nearly as old at the time as Rocky/Stallone is now, so the believable factor is just a little too-far fetched, so I give it only 7 out of 10 stars.",Rocky Balboa

""Rocky Balboa"" harks back to ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky 2"" with a decent story between fights. While Sylvester Stallone won't be winning Academy Awards any time soon, he slips comfortably into the character of Rocky Balboa, now an aging boxer tired of being a has-been. He goes back into the ring with Mason Dixon, played by Antonio Tarver, who definitely needs a few acting lessons before his next role. The cast is rounded out by Burt Young, who appears as Rocky's confidante and provides us with many comic relief moments, Geraldine Hughes providing a sweet love-interest and Milo Ventimiglia as Rocky jnr who interacts well with Sylvester Stallone. The backdrop of New York City is once again well used, the famous ""Rocky Steps"" reappearing in this one, much to the delight of my family who sat and cheered Rocky on.

It all builds up to another very improbable fight and it goes pretty much as you expect.I taped this movie and fast-forwarded thru probably half of it.

169,kevin_crighton,a very pleasant surprise,7,20 January 2007,"To be honest, I'm not a big Rocky fan. Thought the first was okay, didn't really care for parts 2-4,but kind of liked Rocky 5 for some reason. So going to see Rocky Balboa, I wasn't sure what to expect.And to start with I thought it was a bit slow, and bit to nostalgic for it's own good, trying to tie it in with the first. It shows Rocky wandering around still mourning the loss of his wife (this happened sometime between No.5 and this one). We watch as he goes around places from his past remembering things that he and Adrian used to do, or places they went.However, the movie picks up, when a TV network has a computer fight between Rocky and the new champion, that Rocky wins. As the buzz grows from this, Rocky decides he wants to fight again. Mason Dixon (the champ), is trying to establish credibility as he can't find opponents worth beating (shades of Tyson? who appears in a cameo near the end. His manager decides to set up an exhibition bout between the champ and Rocky in the hope of making the champ popular again.On paper this sounds awful. And the script has some awful lines in it, especially the reasons for Rocky wanting to fight again.......However, Stallone as director and actor knows how to make this work as a movie, and it does. It has the same things you'd expect from any Rocky movie - training montages, that music (always gets you), the fight montages - and yet you'd feel cheated if they weren't there.The actual fight is as good as the one in the first. Stallone, whom I believe is around 60, looks convincing, and from what I've read the actors both were actually hitting each other for realism (in a Rocky context. In truth the fight would probably have been stopped pretty early).I found myself really enjoying this movie. As I said, Stallone the director knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged, and as an actor he gives a really good performance. As Copland has proved, Stallone can be really good as an actor given good material, it's a disappointment however that here Stallone the writer lets him down. But all the actors give good performances, and as a result lift what COULD have been an awful self-indulgent movie, into a well made fitting finale for a character that people have loved for years. And it's made me want to go back and take a look at all the others again. Who knows, maybe I'll like them more after this.",Rocky Balboa

But this sixth and final installment patches up everything and brings Rocky back to the issue of character. We're dealing with people, not Communists, and that's where Rocky Balboa shines.Rocky's back to living life how he can. Adrian died. His son has issues. Paulie's still Paulie but things change for him too. Rocky runs into someone he hasn't met since the first film, who now has a son. He owns a restaurant. A computer simulation then shows he could knock out the current champ if he was in his prime. That champ's managers take notice and convince Rocky to an exhibition bout to help Mason Dixon earn some respect for his opponents aren't up to snuff..I found the first half-hour difficult to swallow as, Paulie notes, we see Rocky living in the past. The relationship with his son is difficult to gulp down too. Balboa has been living his life to the best of his ability and has kept it simple. The dominance of character and doing what's right in life drags but plays so prominently that by the time the bout begins in Las Vegas we get treated to a real show. For Stallone, it was an excellent ending to a character many people have grown old with. I'm happy Rocky ended this way.",Rocky Balboa
171,imbluzclooby,Stallone rekindles the old fame!,8,26 December 2006,"The great and lovable character of Rocky Balboa brings closure to this final installment to the Rocky saga. In this effort he brings a bit more depth, sentimentality, and sincerity. Thus this story is very personal. We can't begrudge the movie for that, even if it is excessive. I found myself wincing at the over-sentimentalization. Perhaps I'm too used to movies that are insulting and off-putting. That tells you the sign and influences of our time. Rocky goes back to basics here. He's wearing his hat, gloves and his leather jacket. He visits his late wife's grave daily. He also has Paulie (Burt Young) as his irritable sidekick tagging along. He runs a local Italian restaurant named after his love, of course, Adrian's. He even stumbles across two characters from the original Rocky, Spider Rico and little Marie. The characters come back into Rocky's life and as usual he's always making them more than welcome into his stratosphere. His son works a white collar job nearby and Rocky is on the make of solidifying his waning bond with his son. At 60 rocky decides to get in the ring with the current champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. Rocky's purposes are not like he wants to revamp his heydays, but rather to unleash some inner demons and burdens that have troubled him since Adrian's passing. It makes sense. A fighter is always a fighter regardless of their age and health. He trains again in that similar and uplifting manner as his earlier Rocky movies and it's fun and inspiring. The bout is actually believable when you see it. Forget the outcome, because it's a good fight and doesn't stick to old clichés.This final installment is not about boxing, but rather about being a human being and surviving with dignity in a materialistic world. Rocky Balboa makes all the correct choices and sustains all the interpersonal relationships amongst it's characters appropriately. My hats off to Sly! Thanks for the memories.",Rocky Balboa

It was cold, it rained half the time, and you had to idle the car now and then to keep the windows from fogging. But one thing amazed me: during the fight scenes between Rocky and Apollo Creed, you could see the cars shaking. I mean, literally shaking, as if the wind were blowing at high speed. This is the kind of excitement the Rocky series has inspired since 1973, and this final film is no exception. This film reveals the persistent message of every film in the series in detail. ""It's not how hard you get hit, it's how many times you can get up and keep going!"" Rocky is a singularity in a world of chaos. He is devoted to Adrian, even though she has passed away. He still befriends his brother-in-law, Paulie, even though Paulie has never truly grown up. He is a testament to the persistence of the human spirit, always trying to see the good. The cast, new and old, is perfect in this summation of the series, and Stallone's signature in this film is evident from beginning to end.

But when I saw it I was impressed. Rocky is retired and now owns a restaurant. It's a cozy-seeming place with Rocky memorabilia, and where you can get food that is questionably Italian. It's also a place where you can shake the owner's hand (if he doesn't come over and shake yours first), get an autograph, and have your picture taken with him. On this last point: one senses that there isn't a lot of vanity involved here; Rocky just likes looking out for people; making them happy. This impression is so strong that one may be tempted to play amateur psychologist and see his restaurant business as a subconscious motif of nurturing. Whatever, Rocky comes off as a battered old lion with a golden heart.His biggest supporter, his wife, is now deceased and he visits her grave regularly to feel close and meditate. He even has a chair stashed in a tree nearby for this purpose. Sadly, he doesn't see his son as much as he'd like to. The chief reason being that his son feels overshadowed by him; that his father is in the way of him being his own person. So he avoids his dad, makes excuses.This film could easily have been self-serving, pathetic, sad, and embarrassing for Stallone (and his alter ego) as is often the case when people seem to be reaching back for past glory. But Stallone actually came up with an intelligently written scenario his audience could believe and accept. In other words, a ""legitimate"" continuation of the Rocky saga. -Not some contrived nonsense to give him an excuse to get back on the screen as Rocky because he misses the limelight. This movie was subtly intelligent and well paced.How does Rocky get back into the ring? -Well managers and promoters of a young boxer decide that since he hasn't fought anyone of real consequence, he's not viewed as a legitimate or real champion. After viewing a televised mock computer match up between their man and a young Rocky Balboa (with their man coming out on top), they get it into their heads to have a real match up with Rocky, figuring it would be a way of getting their fighter the credentials he desperately needed. Never mind that Rocky was now well past his prime.Somehow this thing eventually gets off the ground and the 2 fighters, the young champion and the legendary Rocky, meet in the ring.

So we are not surprised by anything. The film is nicely paced and Rocky takes us down memory lane for those who didn't see Rocky I thru V. The flashbacks of the previous Rocky fights and of the neighborhood and his deceased wife, Adrian, are good and don't last long, however Paulie (Young) is up to here with them. Well, we had to have some other conflict other than Rocky's son (Ventimiglia) tired of living in the great man's shadow.Maybe this movie will motivate some to go and see the other Rocky movies. Then again, maybe not, but they are worth seeing at least once.Rocky meets the little girl, Marie, he used to walk home when she was a kid in the neighborhood. Marie (Hughes) is no longer a little kid, and the movie sort of romanticizes the relationship without going there. Does that make sense? Anyway, a good family movie except for the littlest kids who will cry at the sight of blood or someone hitting someone else (unless it's them doing the hitting). Well, there is a fight, you know. And, a darn good one it is too. Ranks up there with the fight in Million Dollar Baby. No, we don't forget the good ones. Let's just say, this fight becomes more than a boxing exhibition.

If it was a film in isolation and Rocky 1 to 5 had never been made then it wouldn't have been too bad. However we have all been here before and here lies the problem, what more can you do with the same story and characters.Unfortunately Stallone, talented as he is, decided to do another Rocky, but with no new ground or purpose.

Adrian's brother Paulie is still dispensing his unique brand of sweetness and light but Rocky rarely sees his son, who got fed up with life in the old man's shadow.Out of the blue, Rocky gets the boxing bug again. The reasons for this are not apparent. No epiphanies, just an urge to get back in the ring. Must be the eye of the tiger, or somesuch. Anyway, he seems less keen on boxing matters than on Marie, the grown-up little girl who lived down memory lane. Marie has a son whose departed father is black (""Jamaica?"" says Rocky, ""A European""  bdum-chh!).Dialogue-wise, Sly still has a few sharp jabs to throw but his script is mostly a succession of motivational speeches and self-help mantras. Almost every character has a bloated monologue to deliver. It's like going 12 rounds with a life coach.And in sulky champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon, Rocky is up against his most boring opponent ever. We need a sneering, cocky villain  a Carl Weathers, a Mr T, a hunk of Dolph We get charisma-free former light-heavyweight plank Antonio Tarver.Dixon is peeved when, broadcast on TV, a computer-simulated bout between himself and a peak-fitness Rocky ends with him eating canvas. The moneymen set up an exhibition match. It'll be a complete mismatch or will it? If anticipation of the climactic bout is low, dramatic tension is zero. Stallone does, however, push the right buttons when the action finally gets underway in the final third. But somehow the customary training montage doesn't give quite the same buzz as it used to.Nobody wants to see the Italian Stallion in the knacker's yard, but in their heart of hearts, even his most ardent fans have to admit that we're merely indulging him with this weary nostalgia trip.",Rocky Balboa
177,Jakemcclake,A Good Movie About a Former Boxer: That Becomes a Bad Comback Fantasy,7,4 January 2010,"Stallone made Rocky very likable. This Rocky movie was very similar to the original in that it exposes what made Rocky so likable. Rocky's ironically non-confrontational nature comes through in many of the scenes in the first part of this movie.The story's dark realism permeates the most of the first part. To make this more evident, most of the first part of the movie is shot in dark places and/or lit with single street lights. The darkness of this appeared to parallel the stage of life, that Rocky existed in. This is just like the original Rocky.Then of course we get the fantasy ending. Without this fantasy ending, the movie would have been much more interesting.",Rocky Balboa
178,Thorsten-Krings,Great stuff,10,30 July 2007,"I really like this film. Unlike the middle Rockys this was a soul searching effort like Rocky 1. Although to some extent an action movie, this is really a very introspective film about a man trying to find out after 60 odd years what he or his life is all about. It's not about winning, it's about walking tall. From that point alone it is a very deserving finale to the Rocky saga. It also shows that Rocky is an interesting character: he has values and beliefs but he is actually a clever guy who wants people to think he is stupid. I guess that goes for Stallone as well who is not only a terrific writer (he gave great depth to the Pauly character) but also a tremendous director.",Rocky Balboa

180,teh_mode,"Confettied with cliché it may be, if Rocky Balboa ever meant anything to you, this film will earn your enjoyment.",6,30 January 2007,"Life imitates art perhaps, as the Rocky franchise seriously threatened to outstay its welcome with this ""final"" instalment into the greatest underdog tale in cinema history. It would be easy to suggest Stallone is cashing in on a fleeting career that went balls up somewhere between that horrible Judge Dredd adaptation and his impressive (but box-office unfriendly) try at acting in James Mangold's Copland (1997). From one perspective, Stallone going back to where he started smacks of desperation and cynicism on the actor/director's part. Rocky had already retired at the beginning of Rocky V (The one with Tommy Morrison, remember?), and in real life has already had a birthday cake with 60 candles on it. But if we are going to go along with the fancifulness of the Rocky universe one more time (and we have done it 5 implausible times before, so why not this time?), we might as well believe the old Italian Stallion, at the grand old age of 188, can still be Rocky the boxer.Since the last instalment, Adrian has unfortunately passed away, and is now rested to the earth, and visited by Rocky throughout the film. Paulie (Young) is thankfully still around, half-drunk and poison-mouthed as ever. Rocky has opened a restaurant in South Philadelphia, where he entertains guests with his ""Y'know I used to box"" stories. Unfortunately  he has lost contact with his son, but desperately tries to reinvigorate their relationship together. The younger Balboa is understandably annoyed at living in his father's inescapable shadow, reluctant to renew the family bond. When a computerised fight between Rocky and current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Tarver) predicts a knockout victory for Rocky, talk begins hotting up for a possible exhibition contest between the two combatants. After taking the audience on a trip down memory lane  visiting the pet shop, the old ice rink and his old neighbourhood  it is fight time. You can pretty much guess the rest.One of the impressive things about the Rocky franchise was that he didn't always necessarily win. If you are unaware of how this one finishes, the finale really is up in the air. The implausibility of the Rocky universe allows us to believe he can do it, yet he is facing someone almost half his age. Rocky Balboa is certainly confettied with cliché, and swimming in sentimentality  but it would be heartless to say it isn't enjoyable. The moment the old codger revs up the montage sequence one last time, and then proceeds to hit meat chucks, run up those famous steps and then shout ""YEAH!!!"" you could almost feel the audience doing the same. And the fight scene is effortlessly exciting, reminding us just why Rocky was such a lovable character. Yes this is all a load of old tosh, but not even the old cynic in me can muster up a worthy criticism of this film. If Rocky ever meant anything to you, then surely you could be moved just this once more. Now if only Rambo IV can defy those expectation just that little bit further.",Rocky Balboa
181,RCWjr,Rocky Balboa is the perfect bookend for the franchise,8,19 December 2006,"I have to admit, when I heard Sly was going back to the ring with Rocky, I was skeptical. All that skepticism was washed away after catching an early sneak preview of the film last night.The stain of Rocky 5 has been washed away. I think that, more than anything else, brought Sly back to Rocky as he wanted to allow the character to go out the right way.Harking back to the first film's story over action and flash, Rocky Balboa takes you down an emotional road with Rocky. It is a more realistic ending to his career than the street fight we were given in Rocky 5.I loved how Sly shows the shadow that Rocky exudes and also lives in. There is tragedy in his life this time, not to give away anything, but it is this one tragedy that gives Rocky his strength and his weakness. Once he is able to deal with that, then he is able to deal with the monster inside of him that is still breathing and wants to come out.The fight sequence is strategically done, making you feel as if you are watching a real HBO PPV event. There is no rock music, just the score music we fell in love with from the original.All in all, fans of the franchise could not have hoped for a better book end to the character. Sly has delivered Rocky to his true home finally.",Rocky Balboa
182,yashrajs536,Balboa is back!!!,9,7 July 2015,"The 6th film in the rocky saga ""Rocky Balboa"" is as superb as the original one:- ""Rocky (1976)"" . This film is concentrated on emotions of life give some lessons of life and the fight shown in the climax was giving much excitement to me!!!!The film has got a great actors and the direction done by Stallone is superb and should be appreciated by everyone and the story Stallone wrote for this movie is also superb!!!!The film has not featured Adrain but still has a good emotions of family and also showed a good relationship of father and son.The two scenes in the movie 1. Stallone giving lesson to his son 2.And the realisation of his past while fighting are the scenes loved by me in the movie. And there is an also lesson which I can't remember but in the film is that was also good.Overall the film is a great start and revival of Rocky saga and i think its upcoming spin off film ""Creed (2015)"" will also be good.Hail Rocky!!!!",Rocky Balboa
183,athena24,Same plot - Sixth time,6,14 May 2011,"Stallone is very believable, playing his most frequent character to date, Rocky Balboa. His direction is also good. And as a standalone movie, I would rate it higher, but it's not. It's a sixth movie in a series. And each time it's basically the same plot with different boxer to fight in the end. What different in each movie, is the reason for which Rocky takes the challenge and fights his opponents. This specific movie, doesn't have any real drama of the previous installments. No one dies here ( not in the middle of the movie at least ), no major dispute, nothing of this kind. Just Rocky's feeling that he still has got the strength and will to fight.I saw the previous 5, so naturally wanted to see the sixth. To know what happened to Rocky, and find out that he's living his quiet life as restaurant owner. But other then that, everything seemed to be same as before. Same talk, same walk, same Paulie, same feelings, same discussions on who's the best all time fighter and so on... . Much footage is used on the late Adrian. After the movie ended, I was left with the feeling that it was a well done move, but I've seen all this before from same man.",Rocky Balboa
184,pacman-81,He's back and swinging one last time,8,21 December 2019,"A retired Rocky Balboa wins against reigning champion Mason Dixon in a computer simulation of a fight seen by millions. Mason cannot accept this or jokes against his character and therefore challenges Rocky to a 10-round exhibition bout. Rocky is a living Philadelphia legend. Tragically, his beloved Adrian has passed away from cancer, leaving the 59-year-old former champ to face his latter years in a lonely state. On an ESPN show dubbed Then vs. Now, a computer pits Rocky against the reigning heavyweight champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon and has Rocky winning by knockout. The show inspires him to get his boxing license to do some sparring. Dixon's managers get a reluctant Rocky to face his younger opponent.
The film is emotional as it touches on Rocky's loneliness, his fight for a relationship with his son and his battle against the loss of his beloved Adrian. Can Rocky still mix it with his much younger opponent? Well you know he'll go down swinging as he tries. Another great addition to the franchise.",Rocky Balboa
185,imagiking,Rocky Balboa: Stallone's Masterpiece,8,3 April 2010,"The sixth and final installation in Stallone's career making and spanning Rocky series, Rocky Balboa comes 16 years after its predecessor, Sly's attempt at righting the wrong he now sees in Rocky V.After a long and eventful life as a legendary boxing heavyweight, Rocky Balboa now owns a pugilistic themed diner, named after his late wife. Lost in a modern world where he is largely viewed as an overrated has-been, he decides eventually to return to local boxing as a part-time hobby, the only life he has ever known one he feels is incomplete. Inspired by a theoretical computer fight between Balboa and current champ Mason Dixon, the latter's management extend the offer of an exhibition bout to the former.The prospect of a sixth Rocky film seemed initially absurd to many, the then 59 year old Stallone clearly far too old to manage to create anything of substance. Well, shame on them. Rocky Balboa not only gives the strongest Rocky film since the original, but begs that most rarely positively answered of questions: does it top the first? Beginning with a quick introduction to the modern champion and the popular view thereof, we soon after see the familiar silhouette of our hero, rising alone from his bed, the weight of loss worn heavy on his shoulders. The death of Adrian is a bold and daring move for the franchise, but one which proves ingenious. His morning routine shows us the turtles Cuff and Links, the first of many throwbacks to the original, showing us the thematic synonymity between. Striking from the start is the colour scheme: the deep blues Stallone uses for the home showing us his character's depression and loneliness; the rich reds of his restaurant his only escape to times of glory. Proving himself with this film as an adept director, Stallone presents a visually compelling experience. The central performance is incredible, undoubtedly Stallone's best to date. There are two separate occasions of emotional meltdown, both entirely believable, moving, and upsetting. Uplifting are the monologues delivered by the tired and under-appreciated Balboa, his striking out at the impositions of his age wonderful with their genuineness. The question of age and the concomitant limitations punctuate the movie, in part an extended metaphor for Stallone's own career, in part definitive proof that he still packs a cinematic punch despite his near sexagenarianism. The support of Reynolds and Hughes is instrumental; their performances each bringing tremendous backup characters. Ventimiglia's is the only lacking element, detracting from his character with some off-key iterations. The story is, though somewhat fantastical, compelling and engaging, having us root for our favourite boxer both in and out of the ring. Concluding the film, the ending is nothing short of perfect, sending the franchise off in the best way possible.With surprisingly efficient and skillful direction, sublime acting, and a story that will uplift as well as inspire thought, Rocky Balboa is Stallone's masterpiece. Proof to a doubting world that the writer/actor/director still has the potential for brilliance within, it dispels all illusions of the restrictions of age. Bravo Sly.",Rocky Balboa

187,KeremUlucay,NOT A MASTERPIECE BUT A GREAT CLASSIC OF ROCKY,7,6 January 2019,"After 16 years, sixth Rocky movie has come. Sylvester Stallone has improved his acting and directing. Technology changed. Visuality is better. Rocky is old. Adrian has gone. Rock and Paulie are still together. These things are enough reasons to see this movie. I really liked to see some characters which we saw before in Rocky movies like Spider Rico, Little Marie, older Rocky Jr, Duke... Also this movie have an extraordinary main event but it gets more realistic during the film. Final fight was more realistic than I thought. Seeing these events from perspective of media was great. There were a lot of references and a great Mike Tyson cameo. At the end of the movie we learn even if he loses, even he is not enough to be best, Rocky is the real champ of all time in hearts of fans. Best thing this movie did is telling how strong Rocky's will is perfectly with flashbacks, with his sidekicks, with his ""eye of the tiger"". And worst thing this movie did is Rocky Jr.'s story. It didnt satisfied me, could be better for me.",Rocky Balboa
188,Casablanca3784,Stallone's A Genius,10,24 December 2006,"Aw, who wants to see a movie about a has-been fighter the bug's bit again? It's gotta be corny. Hoakey. Why didn't Stallone leave well enough alone when he was way ahead as the Italian Stallion? All of the above entered my mind but since other movies yesterday started at inconvenient times for us, we took a ""chance"" on ""Rocky Balboa."" Some ""chance"". The film is unbelievably good and Sly Stallone HAS to be a genius for pulling it off. The story is wonderful; the script is super; the acting is super and is as good, if not better, than any ""Rocky"" predecessor. And Sly is the brains behind the works!The best boxing film I ever saw; in fact, one of the best movies I ever saw,was ""Million Dollar Baby."" Next in line comes ""The Cinderella Man"" and the third was the ""Rocky"" series. I put ""Balboa"" right behind the first of the ""Rocky"" films. But the thing is that ""Balboa"" isn't necessarily a fight film; it's a film about LIFE. It makes no difference whether Rocky wins or loses in ""Balboa""--what counts is the psychological makeup of the man. It's about Adrian's tombstone and Rocky's undying love for and devotion to the mother of his son. It's whether he'll maintain such devotion while being constantly around Marie. It's about a strained relationship between Rocky and his son who objects to constantly being in the shadow of his famous father. It's about determination. It's about inspiration and courage. In summation, Stallone very very successfully weaves an intensely intriguing story using boxing as a backdrop instead of a main attraction.It is now Dec.24,06 and there are a few more films I want to see before the start of the new year but this I'll say: right now, ""Rocky Balboa"" is the best film I've seen this year. Last week I saw ""Pursuit of Happiness"" which was truly excellent. It was my favorite film of '06. No longer.",Rocky Balboa
189,T-ZER0,After all these years Rocky's still got it!!,8,5 February 2020,"I regret to say that when I first saw this film, I didn't like it that much. That was because I was watching all the Rocky movies in one day and I had just come back from the stink that is Rocky V.But now that I own the 40th Anniversary collection and have seen all the movies, I can skip Rocky V and watch this one after Rocky IV.Let me just say there was a lot of nostalgic references I did not notice when I saw it the first time, only by watching the previous films again did I understand.As Slyvester Stallone said, this film is redemption for Rocky. Because everybody thought Rocky V was a terrible way to end the franchise and a bad movie. So why not make another that shows, despite all the trials he's endured throughout the previous films, he's still got it.This movie succeeds in ways Rocky V couldn't. Those ways are Rocky dealing with the loss of a loved one. (In Rocky V it was Mickey.) And finding the courage to fight again. Mason Dixon is a like able character, because of the fact that he is not a clear villain, he is an antagonist. He has his reasons for being sour towards Rocky, it's because most people think he could never be better than Rocky. Again, a concept that was in Rocky V, but done better here.I find it interesting that they brought Marie back from the first film. Sure, it's not the same actress. But I'm glad she could get some redemption. I've always said the Rocky movies have taught me how to deal with life problems, and this movie shows it. For example, remember when Marie said: ""Screw you Creepo!"" In the first film? Well, years later, Rocky proved that wrong by how much he can care about someone like her. I'm hoping that something like that works out for me, because some people say I'm a creep for how I look and the fact that I can't communicate well. I hope to meet those people again, not to prove them wrong, but to show them I am not what they think. I don't hate those people. I just wish they didn't hate me.Also, the talk that he gives his son is what I use all the time for myself. ""Nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it isn't about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward.""Everybody should memorize that, it's such a good quote and good mental therapy. The nostalgia in this film is real, with the training montage playing ""Gonna Fly Now"", Rocky drinking eggs and punching meat, and finally, Rocky climbing the top of the steps!In the final match, Rocky proves he's still got what it takes, and Mason Dixon gets his fans' respect back. Both sides win, but I wish they would've said what happened to Mason Dixon after this film. But that's a problem that the Rocky franchise has. They never explain what happened to people. But that's not so bad because Supergirl the show does worse.Rocky didn't win the match, but he didn't need to, he went the distance again. So if I were you, I would watch this film over Rocky V. You'd be doing yourself a favor, and you might enjoy it. It's really good to see a modern Rocky movie!",Rocky Balboa
190,colonel_green,"Get 'em, Rock!",10,28 December 2006,"The idea of ""Rocky VI"" seemed risible at a glance (not to mention coming perilously close to making a classic ""The Simpsons"" joke obsolete; but then, Adrian is dead, so ""Adrian's Revenge"" isn't happening even in a hypothetical ""Rocky VII."" However, I must label this film excellent. A solid ""A"" from me.Stallone ignores a lot of the developments from ""Rocky V"" here, which he has said he doesn't like (Rocky's brain damage and financial situation), and that's a good choice. I admire Stallone's desire to end the series better than ""Rocky V""; he made a lot of money off this character (and, really, who wouldn't?), but the first film was a personal passion, and it's nice that, like his character, he got one last round. He's not a great actor, but he's crafted a compelling character in Rocky; Rocky feels like a real person.I'm glad that Milo Ventimiglia seems to have finally gotten past playing teenagers (now that he's nearly thirty).Given that he's nearly sixty, I was apprehensive about Stallone boxing, but based on the film I can definitely still buy him as a tough guy. Most guys don't look as good in their twenties as he does now.I was extremely relieved that they didn't go *there* with Marie; you could feel the audience in my theatre was a bit apprehensive about that, but Stallone again resists the egotistical choice. Her presence is also valuable because otherwise this film hasn't got a single woman worth mentioning.And, after all these years, that music still makes you want to cheer.",Rocky Balboa
191,loufalce,A One Way Ticket to Palookaville!,1,27 February 2007,"Trash! Yet another sequel in this everlasting series of sequels by the king of sequels Sylvester Stallone.In this sequel, our Hero comes out yet again for another fight. Watching this rethreaded bald tire of a movie is torture. It shows how far- or rather how little Stallone has come as an actor over the last 30 years.The first 2 times it was fun, but now it is just old hat. Thoroughly predictable from start to finish.This is the worst boxing film since Barbara Striesands 1979 vanity production called ""The Main Event"".About the only creative thing about this stinkeroo is its title. Its called ""Rocky Balboa"" instead of ""Rocky VI"".Yet the numbers do not lie. It IS the sixth film in the franchise.

This is the only film from the past five parts that is more about drama, and not about sports, and because of this I like this part more than the rest. Rocky is still a pleasure to watch, and his speech to his son is probably the most powerful thing I've heard.",Rocky Balboa
193,frankwhat,The End of an Era,9,26 December 2006,"I have to admit that when I first heard they were going to be making this film I thought it would be a disaster. Something about an aging Sylvester Stallone just didn't appeal to me, as it seemed like a ludicrous idea. Then I started hearing through the grapevine that the critics said it was actually a worthy approach so I had to see for myself. Wow, they were right. I simply found this to be a delightful way to finish off the series. Even though the first two installments were slightly ahead of my time I grew up on this franchise and found it to be the most inspiring saga I think is out there. The only possible exception is the fifth one, which I still liked regardless.While it can be argued that Stallone can't make them like he used to as the concept just doesn't fit in today's society, I thought he was able to adapt the storyline perfectly to modern times. Boxing has become a joke (like most professional sports) in recent years and Rocky seemed to represent back when they used to be pure. When strength came from the inside through heart and determination and not only what's on the outside.There was a few times when various members of the audience applauded which shows how much this movie can get you wrapped up in it. There is so much reminiscing that it's even sad at certain points as it stays very true to real life and what it's about. How neighborhoods change, the people change, and pretty much everything else changes over time. It also exhibits that good memories do hurt, even more so than the bad one's sometimes. The most important lesson ""Rocky Balboa"" covered is that life is relentlessly tough and is in fact probably the hardest thing most people come across in general, but you have to do your best and persevere. The one true motif of any Rocky film is that he would never stay down, whether it was in or out of the ring and that is what he tries to pass along to his son and us.The writing was excellent and I really loved the dialog along with some of the small speeches Rocky gives. The end fight scene might not be as great as the prior finales, but it still is way above par nonetheless. My favorite part of any of the ""Rocky's"" has almost always been the training montage and this one was suitable, however not the best either. It definitely passed inspection though and still made me want to get up out of my chair to start working out right there.What hit me the hardest when the movie ended was that this is really it and not only did I see it as the end of a legacy but also the end of a part of my childhood. Rocky symbolizes much more than just a fictional boxer; he depicts simpler times to a whole generation of young adults. Make sure you stay through the credits as there's a very beautiful scene at the end (although it only last a couple seconds).Both familiar fans and new watchers will find this film enjoyable. I hate to know Rocky is over now but I couldn't think of a better way to do it. ""Rocky Balboa"" brings great closure to the better days! ""Yo, Adrian,"" he did it!",Rocky Balboa
194,sammielimehouse-84658,One of the Best Rocky Movies,8,8 August 2021,"This was the perfect ending to the Rocky franchise and to Rocky as a character. And while I have enjoyed the Creed films so far, part of me wishes they left this franchise alone, as this was the perfect ending possible. This movie is just everything I love about this franchise. It had a fantastic score, great performances by the main cast (especially Sylvester Stallone's performance which deserved an Oscar nomination at the very least), and the end fight scenes were great. Don't even get me started on Rocky's legendary speech to Robert. Overall, this is a great movie that I rewatch regularly.",Rocky Balboa
195,etsm92,'Rocky' is pure Adrenaline,8,26 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa/2006/***1/2Main Stars: Sylvester Stallone Burt Young Antonio Tarver Geraldine HughesRocky Balboa is as good as or perhaps better than Rocky. It's obviously better than Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, and Rocky V. I'm kind of contradicting myself saying it's better and as good as Rocky. Okay, since Rocky introduced the characters Rocky Balboa, Adrian Pennino (soon to be Adrian Balboa), Mickey and others, I can see it is the most original and the best. It is the classic never to be overthrown by any of the other sequels. There. I said it. As long as Stallone doesn't write Rocky VII, I'll be fine. Five Rocky's is a lot for one boxer and a trainer and a wife and an opponent. And coming out with a sixth is too much until I heard how glorious it was. I asked myself, How can this be? There's another Rocky out and no one thinks it's a waste of time and money? Well, in my opinion, it wasn't a waste of time at all. In fact, it was so worth it, the time flew by. It felt like I sat down in the theater and then I walked out in the quickest time. That is how entertaining that movie was. If I see an appalling film (like Be Cool for instance), I'll be so bored it'll take hours and hours for the film to end. At least it seems like that. And it's true; it took longer than Be Cool actually was in running time to finish. All you see is a bunch of people being beat up with bats and shot in the face. The rest of the junk just flew past me, because I was awed that the filmmakers would even think of putting that piece of crap on the screen. Back to sanguine criticism The character Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is entertaining to listen to and to watch because of the slight ignorance he sprinkles over his sentences. That makes him amusing. He also has a good heart. He's a nice man and he means well. As for what he has to do in this film Actually, he doesn't have to do anything, but he decides to fight in the ring once again and, I hope, for the last time because he's getting old no matter how ""in shape"" he may be. He fights after seeing on ESPN News that he is compared to the modern heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver). A few days after he sees this, he, once again, wants to get into the ring and fight and his best friend, Paulie (Burt Young), supports that. However, his son ""don't"". His son has been growing apart from him for a while. He wants to be apart even more knowing that his father is going back in the ring once more and realizes his friends are only liking him because he is the son of the most famous boxer ever to live. That's also how he earned his job. But Rocky tells his son to shape up and deal-with-it. Does the son take that advice? Maybe. As for Rocky, he has found another woman to hang out with. Not as a wife, as a partner, as a friend. No one can ever replace Adrian, who dies of cancer in 2002. It said that on the tombstone. Rocky does need a woman to give him some advice, so why not pick Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a bartender at a bar. He meets her there, takes her home, meets her obedient son, and becomes friends with her soon after. Rocky needs to keep his focus on boxing though but it's not about winning the tournament, it's about playing it. He wants to go back not to win, but to play. He likes the sport, he gets in shape once again, and he plays the sport, no matter how painful it is. During the match, Rocky has some flashbacks. Flashbacks that are so powerful, he does well in the ring. Does he win? Maybe. So, to get that boxing fever off his chest, he fights a good fight and still respects his opponent, Mason no matter how egotistic he may be. Because, as I said, he has a good heart and means well. Before I go watch the DVD that is waiting for me to watch it in the den in my house, I will tell you that seeing every Rocky movie in existence is not important. What is important is seeing the first and the sixth. 2, 3, 4, and 5 are not necessary to watch. You'll catch on easily without seeing those. Movie directed by Sylvester Stallone.",Rocky Balboa
196,Derek237,Going the distance one more time,8,3 January 2007,"There's an interesting moment in Rocky Balboa, it occurs right near the end, during the fight. For the first time ever in the series, we hear Rocky's internal monologue. It's brief, only about two sentences, but it means a lot to this movie, and the series as a whole: Rocky coaches and encourages himself. Many characters have come and gone and have coached Rocky by the ringside, but if the series has shown us nothing else, it's about believing in yourself: having self-faith, and self-worth. People who brush off this series as lame and cartoonish, and didn't bother paying this final entry much attention most likely won't bother considering a detail like that, unfortunately.This is the last Rocky film. At least, I hope so. Rocky V promised to go back to Rocky's roots, but only did so geographically, much to the disappointment of fans, and even Stallone himself. I can see why he felt the need to revisit Rocky one last time, in a film that finds Rocky in a similar place as he was in the first film: alone and unsure of himself. Some of the films in the series were better than others, I can't say I loved every one, but what's still so appealing about the series is that you're not just watching new opponents and new matches, you're also watching chapters of a man's life. The real appeal is in the character, not the individual movies.So here we enter the latest chapter of Rocky's life. Adrian has passed away. Rocky is much, much older. He wakes up alone every morning and frequently visits his wife's grave. He owns a restaurant and greets guests, telling stories of the old glory days, becoming a complete cliché of the retired, punch-drunk athlete. I'm sure You probably know the story about the computer-generated match and all of the circumstances leading to his fight with Mason Dixon already, so I won't get into it. But, much like the first film, this is a film about a boxer, not about boxing (which is what most of the sequels transformed in to).We get some scenes with Dixon. He's not an arrogant, angry enemy that I had expected him to be. He simply cares about his own image, is perhaps over-confident, and to me, he was more reminiscent of the character Apollo Creed than any of the other opponents that appeared in the previous films. Some unexpected characters pop into the story, and key characters in the Rocky saga also return. Guess what? Paulie's still a miserable drunk. He has a little more heart in this one, though.Stallone has described the film as a ""love letter"" to the fans of the series, and he has done a good job bringing back some much needed credibility to the over all story. Rocky is his creation, after all. At the beginning the words, ""A Slyvester Stallone Film"" appear. This may make some people giggle, but it's his baby. There are even moments when Sly displays a keen film-making eye. Other moments, like during the match, however, are almost cringe-inducing.You're either a fan of the series or you're not. If you only liked the first one and tried to forget the sequels, you probably still won't have any affection for this one. Rocky Balboa is a noble effort and brings an appropriate closure to one of the most iconic film characters of all time.My rating: 7/10",Rocky Balboa
197,duraflex,Good note to end on since Rocky V was such a downer,9,30 November 2015,"*SPOILER ALERT* Sylvester Stallone was 60 when he made this movie. He wrote it, directed it and starred in it and that's a big deal for someone half his age.The Rocky character is intact - as likable as ever with a believable heart and soul - someone the viewer can actually care about. An unscrupulous accountant embezzled or lost most of Rocky's money in a previous film and Rocky now owns and runs a small Italian restaurant in South Philly. Wife Adrian is recently deceased and Rocky misses his soulmate badly. His son is conflicted about his relationship with his father and living in his dad's large shadow.Of course it all comes down to Rocky's final fight against a boxer about 25 years younger. Much of the ""exhibition"" fight staged in Las Vegas is handled through montage and it's often painful to watch the barbaric sport play out but finally it ends with both men still standing. The alternate ending where Rocky is declared the winner should have been the one used in the final release but at at least it's included under special features on the DVD.The film cost $24 million to make - that's 24 times more than the original but this show has a lot more glitz and production values.Very good film - would have been great with the alternate ending.",Rocky Balboa
198,Cocacolaguy912-2,Rocky bows out respectably.,8,10 July 2007,"Rocky Balboa is a reflection of the first one, not silly, and not corny. It is a very well written and acted film that is light hearted, and at points very sad for me. Not depressing. Sad. In fact, I cried. The last line in this movie made me shed tears.I really don't know what to say. Rocky Balboa was sad...to me. It was uplifting and unique and even humorous at parts, but sad because it was just so...memorable. (I know that isn't a word, but whatever.) See this film, it may not be as fun as the 4th, (while, although silly, is the most fun in my opinion), but it is as moving as the 1st, and it brings us back to how, where, and why it all started...30 years later.Thank you, Sly Stallone.",Rocky Balboa
199,Robert_Hearth,"""The Only Kind Of Respect That Matters Is Self-Respect"" --- Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone)",9,14 April 2007,"""Rocky Balboa"" (2006) Directed By: Sylvester Stallone Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Burt Young, Antonio Tarver, Geraldine Hughes, Milo Ventimiglia, Tony Burton, & Talia Shire MPAA Rating: ""PG"" (for boxing violence and some language) Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is back after years of retirement. A few years after the death of his beloved wife, Adrian (Shire), a computer-generated match between him and the biggest boxing champion of the time, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Tarver), excites many people. Could Rocky really beat Dixon or has the world of boxing become just too difficult for him? Rocky, who was once perfectly content with just living for his community and for his restaurant, Adrian's, suddenly becomes very antsy and he knows that he must return to the sport he lovesone last time. When it was announced that this famous boxer would be going back into the ring after nearly sixteen years in retirement, the idea became a universal joke. After ""Basic Instinct 2"" (a sequel that came fourteen years after the original) was slammed by critics and became a financial disaster (opening number 10 on the charts and only grossing a measly $5 million--it did slightly better on DVD), one would think that studios would get the hintyet a sixth installment would be coming (not to mention yet another sequel in Stallone's equally-popular ""Rambo"" franchise""). I, always up for anything, was quite indifferent to the decision. It just didn't matter to mebut I was willing to give it a chance. Heck, I'm a big fan of Stallone and am just glad to see him in something other than ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"". So, did ""Rocky Balboa"" become the surprise hit that Stallone deservedor did it become just another installment in the five dollar bin at Wal-Mart right beside ""Rocky V""? ""Rocky Balboa"" completely surprised me. I expected a cheesy, clichéd, predictable, money-hungry sequel thrown out to attract a few million peoplebut, like I said, I was willing to give it a chance. After all, Stallone actually got me to watch reality TV with his interesting reality show, ""The Contender"", so I had faith in himnot so much in Hollywood, but faith in him. Stallone didn't disappoint. This movie is surprisingly original and completely different from any of the other ""Rocky"" installments. It is not a boxing movie. It's a movie about dealing with aging and loss and learning to love again, even if it is a different kind of love. It's completely implausible, but you won't care, because the movie is engaging enough and heartfelt enough to make you feel that anything is possible. There is a single quote mentioned in this film that seems to sum everything up: ""The last thing to age on somebody is their heart"". ""Rocky Balboa"" proves that this statement is completely true. This movie may not have the machismo, the muscles, or the brawn of the previous movies, but its heart is exceptionally large and very prevalent.The only performance we should really concern ourselves with here is that of Sylvester Stallone. After all, he is playing the title character and there are only a few very brief scenes that do not have him in them. The good news is that Stallone is on the top of his game. The man may have aged quite a bit since ""Rocky V"", but, what he has lost in muscles, he has gained in talent. If you have seen any interview with him about this film, you can actually feel his passion for this project. Not only does he do a wonderful job acting, his direction and writing prove that he is more multi-talented than I ever gave him credit for. Burt Young returns and, like Stallone, he shows that he is still connected to his part. He works so wonderfully well that you forget that he is an actor. Antonio Tarver was goodnot great, but, as this was his first major role, he performed well enough. Sure, he may have scowled a little too much and I didn't feel anything for his character, but he did what he could. Geraldine Hughes and Milo Ventimiglia both do nice jobs. Hughes's Marie makes for a nice female friend to Stallone's Rocky, without trying to take the place of Talia Shire. Ventimiglia strangely resembled Stallone. Their chemistry just clicked. They felt like a father and son. It was quite mesmerizing actually.If ""Rambo IV: Pearl of the Cobra"" is as good as ""Rocky Balboa"", then Stallone will have proved indefinitely that he is a forced to be reckoned with amongst Hollywood's elite. He may not be Oscar gold, but he certainly has talent and not just in acting. His direction is fresh, engaging, and intriguing without looking sappy and stylized. His writing brings heart to the film and had me emotionally-invested in the characters. His performancewell, it was phenomenal. On the very small downside, I had the ending predicted quite early on and it disappointed me with the way it was handled. Another thing was that Rocky's opposition, Tarver's Dixon, was a little mixed in the way that he was portrayed. In some scenes, he came off as snobbish, arrogant, and rude and, in others, he seemed like a sympathetic character that deserved our respect. It just didn't work for me. But, when everything was said and done, ""Rocky Balboa"" was a wonderful way to end this series, proving once and for all that Rocky Balboa is an iconic piece of Hollywood film-making--a character that should be cherished for generations to come.Final Thought: ""Rocky Balboa"" was a fantastic way to end the ""Rocky"" franchise.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",Rocky Balboa
200,das417,Never Give Up.,9,25 March 2007,"In 1976 we were introduced to a young amateur boxer from Philadelphia named Rocky Balboa (Slyvester Stallone). Through five movies we followed his life as he fought his way from one title to another while struggling to keep together his family and personal life. Rocky became one of America's most recognized characters and perhaps one of the most beloved. His struggles seemed almost too human which allowed anyone to relate and thus Rocky became an American movie icon.The latest movie finds Rocky in a lonely position. Long retired from the ring, his wife Adrien is dead and his grown son Robert Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) is distant if not cold towards his father. Paulie (Burt Young) is still around but finds that he no longer has the patience to mourn his dead sister to the level that Rocky does. Rocky's own restaurant does well but is little more then a local bistro where he tells stories of his past fights to customers. His fighting days appear over as Rocky draws deeper and deeper into the sorrow of losing Adrien and a past he cannot let go of. One night brings the past back. Rocky discovers that a local bartender named Marie (Geraldine Hughes) is the same young girl he attempted to help years earlier. Separated from her boyfriend and raising a near wayward son on her own while living in a house that is literally falling apart, Rocky takes pity on her. Out of memory of his earlier attempt to help her earlier, and because he wants to do something good, he takes her son Steps (James Francis Kelly III) under his wing.And this relates back to the second main personal conflict Rocky deals with. Robert Jr., tired of living under his father's shadow, has resisted almost all contact with his still local famous father. An office worker who makes his living in a way more docile then his father's Robert Jr. is content to live away from his father's name even if that means hiding from him. The death of his mother seems to have only increased whatever division there was between the two.However Rocky cannot escape his true calling and this becomes apparent after a computer generated fight between him and the current unpopular World Heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) draws the attention of boxing fans. Dixon, who is seen as having no real challengers, finds his popularity failing. His managers believe that a match between Rocky may be what is needed to draw fan support to Dixon. Dixon himself is not so sure but only relents after he is pressured into doing so. Rocky accepts the challenge and in doing so fights his last fight. What is expected to be a no contest between the younger star and old boxer turns into a fight that forces Dixon to face a boxer he cannot straight out beat. Rocky shows that he had the strength for one last fight and that he can let go of the past without forgetting who he is. What is interesting is that Rocky attempts to bring up everyone around him even if it means cost to him. An old boxer friend eats for free at his restaurant, Marie and Steps have little to give in return for his help, Paulie becomes an aid after losing his job, and his own son is at first put off by his father's reach before coming back to him. Rocky carries the burden everyone around him but in doing so he finds the will and direction that he needs in his own life. Had their been no boxing match in the movie then we still would have had an impressive story of sacrifice and determination. Rocky cares for those around him and will go at any length to show it.One final mention should be the use of flashbacks used throughout the movie. In perhaps the best example I have seen of using past memories, Rocky Balboa is filled with short images from the past movies as Rocky thinks about the past. Sitting at his wife's grave and even in the fight we see glimpses of the past that Rocky hangs onto.Rocky Balboa successfully shows that it is not only a continuation but a true conclusion to the series. Stallone should be applauded for returning to this role and giving a satisfactory ending.9/10",Rocky Balboa
201,brettchatz-1,"The iconic people's champion, Rocky Balboa, returns for one final knockout!",8,17 December 2006,"It may have taken 24 years, but the Philadelphia Museum of Art voted 6-2 in favor of moving an eight foot six-inch tall bronze Rocky Balboa statue back to its rightful place, outside the museum. The symbolism of the Rocky Balboa character is immense. He reflects our fears; our determination and our passions. To think that Stallone, now 60 years of age, has delivered the sixth installment of this series is mind boggling. Critics have reacted with mixed emotion to the latest film, but Stallone has maintained that he's still in great shape and he's intimated that he's got a fine story to tell with the new film. Talia Shire stars alongside Sly Stallone as the inimitable Adrian Balboa, a doting wife to her pugilistic partner - with a twist.Rocky Balboa is everyone and no one at the same time; he's the guy who took his one shot at glory, offered by Apollo Creed, and made it count. The character reflects the hopes of those who've fallen by the wayside and of those who've been trampled upon. Many people can relate to his emotional anguish and that's the sole reason why these films are hugely successful. 16 years after Rocky V and Sylvester Stallone and his alter-ego Rocky Balboa have officially stepped out of retirement. The stoic Italian actor, a legend in his own right, has announced his comeback with the same role that officially put him on the map in 1976. Rocky Balboa, the former heavyweight champion pits himself against a tough, hard-hitting champion in Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. That Stallone has reached the autumn of his years, didn't even factor into the equation. He is still one of the world's most-loved action heroes. According to Sly Stallone ""Rocky Balboa is about everybody who feels they want to participate in the race of life, rather than be a bystander,"" Stallone announced ""You're never too old to climb a mountain, if that's your desire.""Rocky VI or simply Rocky Balboa, as it is known, was a film stuck in limbo for almost 5 years. Hollywood production houses and distributors were reluctant to give the film the green light, for fear that the Rocky franchise had long lost its shine. MGM; Columbia Pictures and Revolution Studios have bankrolled the final chapter and it is toted to be among Stallone's best. It released in the United States on December 20th 2006. The rest of the world will have to wait until March 2007! Stallone certainly can't turn back the clock, but what he has cannot be imitated by any other man: He is Rocky Balboa; there will never be another actor to replace him. Stallone is not only the lead actor, but he also directs, produces and writes the screenplay for Rocky Balboa. This is officially the last in a series of Rocky films, spanning four decades on screen. Rocky is both loved and revered by hundreds of millions of people all over the world. He defies the myth, that only the privileged get a crack at hitting it big. Rocky Balboa, like Sylvester Stallone, tells the story of a man with vaulting ambition, guts and determination. This sixth film in the saga neatly ties up all the loose ends in the Italian Stallion's life. Rocky is managing a restaurant in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, where his patrons come in to listen to the stories of a living legend. After a computer-simulated game shows Rocky beating the reigning champion, Mason Dixon, Balboa decides to get relicensed as a fighter. Both boxing camps are eager to prove their fighters' worth and so it begins.",Rocky Balboa
202,mcsheehey,Inspiring: A Knockout!,9,6 June 2007,"""Rocky"" is one of my all-time favorite films, and I enjoyed the sequels-that is, except for Rocky V. For that reason, I was very skeptical about a new ""Rocky"" film. After all, the first supposed ending was bad enough. When I heard about he plot, I was also expecting the film to be a complete mess. Oh, how wrong I was.""Rocky Balboa"" is the second-best film in the series, which is a tremendous feat. It centers around an aging Balboa (Stallone).Rocky is having troubles with his son, is depressed about the loss of his beloved Adrian, and has lost some of the respect he once had. The film takes us back to the streets of Philadelphia, where it all began. The first three-quarters of the film focus on Rocky's dying relationship with his son, as well as the growing fame of Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the new boxing champion. This part of the film is slightly dull at times, but I found it very realistic and kind of sad. We see the return of the original Rocky, the lovable bumbling boxer with a heart of gold.Obviously, the finale of the film is a fight with Mason Dixon, and it brings the film home. The fight is not what some people will expect, but it brought tears to the eyes of many a person in the audience. In the end, Rocky starts where it began all those years ago. It's one of the most inspiring and tear-jerking endings in film history, and makes the whole film completely worthwhile. Rocky knows how to bring it home, and this film does just that. Yo, Rocky! You did it again!",Rocky Balboa
203,legendaryunderdog,The original was the best but this installment to the series is pretty close,9,15 August 2008,"This is a Rocky movie of a different kind, it doesn't seem to possess all the testosterone filled action that the five other installments in the series had. This movie shows a more 'realistical' Rocky who just recently had his wife pass on, his only friend is his Uncle Pauly and he manages somehow everyday to put a smile on his face at his restaurant amidst all the depressing moments we get to view of him through the film's progression. Director Stallone definitely made an effort to keep a lot of the things from previous Rocky films the same, he still has Pauly and his only son who he is very proud of, he still has that rough and gruff city accent and his lack of debonair has always been a quality of his character that dates all the way back to the original when Rocky and Adrian first met each other. This has a more gloomy, depressing tone at first but ultimately leads up to a (very well I must say) fine conclusion to his career by fighting and keeping up with a boxer (Mason ""The Line"" Dixon) who is thirty years his junior. Overall I really liked this movie and I think it is the perfect bookend to the series. 9 out of 10 stars.",Rocky Balboa
204,SimonHeide,mind over matter in boxing,2,29 January 2008,"Once again we have Rocky ""the Italian Stalian"" in the red corner. This time he gets back into the ring because he feels ""some stuff in the basement"". Something that his best friend and his former wife's brother calls ""the demon"". Maybe you have to be a boxer to understand this which I am not.The first part of the movie is the best as it were with the first rocky movie. Its more a social drama than it's a film about boxing. Rocky has a son who has a difficult time relating to him but after a ""man to man"" talk out in the dark street where his son is told something about the importance of keep going no matter how hard you get punched the two get together again. You see; there is a lot of wisdom relating to boxing that can easily be applied to life in general.I can understand why Sylvester has affection towards this character and wants to do another movie being ""Rocky"" but I can't understand why he follows the formula from his earlier films to such an extent. There is much in the world of sport and also in the boxing world that could be made into a good movie (go see ""a million dollar baby"") - even with the use of Rocky Balboa. He could have let him become a coach instead and have focus on what elite sport demands of the individual without glorifying it. He could also have let Rocky have his ""come back"" but have shown us the darker side of the sport; that when an old champ who is totally over the hill decides to get back into the ring then its because of greed, hunger for media attention or maybe because he is deceiving himself into believing that he is still the greatest. Sylvester doesn't show us the darker side of elite sport but instead he glorifies it to an extent that is saddening to watch. On top of this he even tries to ""persuade"" us that winning a boxing match has more to do with spirit and attitude than skill and speed.That this movie gets an average of 7.5 on IMDb is shocking to me....Regards SimonPs.

206,moimoichan6,The last round is a nostalgic remake of the first,6,31 January 2007,"So, it ends as it began years ago, with a simple but moving tale about will, opportunity, and courage. And if Rocky lost himself in the way (see Rocky V), he manages to find his way home with this last episode. The saga is now over and came back to what's really important : the love story, the realistic and social elements, and the last fight, not for victory, but for proving to yourself you have still the force to stand another round.Of course, everything stays quite simple in this movie, from the direction to the message of the movie, but isn't it that naivety that is so moving about Rocky ? And isn't it the evidence and the simplicity of the film, which is only a American tale about will and love and the popular wisdom of the street of the character, that made the success of the saga ? The movie, however, isn't as good as the first one (even if it's definitely the best after it), for it's almost an absolute remake of ""Rocky"", with the same atmosphere, the same characters, and the same ending fight. And if the characters are now older, and if the problematic of the age has now replace the one of the loneliness and of the losing, the movie still tells the same story it told us at the end of the 70's.The constant references to the first episode gave a nostalgic tone to this last one, increased by the ghost of Adrian, who literally haunts the movie. What the character has lost (his physic reminds me a lot the one of Robert De Niro in the last part of ""Ragging Bull"") is also what the actor has lost, and tries to have back with this movie : a last chance to prove he's not a loser, and just one last great fight, he's still able to give.

A really great and deep message is the life lesson about true heroism, which is not how many punches or great deeds or whatever you accomplish, but ultimately about how much you are able to endure and still stand up on two legs and remain true to yourself and to your ideals. I've seen the movie twice and I have to confess I have had tears in my eyes and tingles across my spine each time I watched the final fight. It's one of the greatest scenes in all cinema and I don't care about any intelligentsia raving about the supposed superiority of 'art cinema' such as Potemkin, Citizen Kane or Antognoni's very long takes. The fight is so stunningly filmed, edited, acted, post-processed and everything that it goes straight to your heart.

Rocky Balboa could be seen as kind of a schmaltzy movie but it's acted with such conviction that you can't help but be drawn in to the story and characters.
Sylvester Stallone absolutely kills it in this movie and i think he should have been nominated for an Oscar for the part. He's underappreciated and shows a lot of emotional depth. The scene where he's talking to Pauly about Adrian makes me cry every time i see it.

Clearly it is a schmaltzy bucket of nostalgia. Plainly if a film this preposterous, formulaic and romantic was made with Hugh Grant in it I would despise it with every fibre of my being. Really  it is just daft. And, undeniably, superb! I defy any man to watch this and not spontaneously start grinning like a loon when the Rocky theme starts (as it frequently does) or when he hits meat (how else would you train?) or, of course, when we get a montage (even Rocky had a montage). I once read something along the lines of ""to the believer no proof is needed; to the non-believer no proof is enough"" and that pretty much sums up Rocky Balboa  if you think you're gonna enjoy, you'll love it; if you don't think you're gonna enjoy it  do something else.",Rocky Balboa

Another memorable moment is Rocky's breakdown to his brother in law about regrets and missing his wife, Stallone actually becomes a man who has come full circle and knows it and wants to go out with a bang rather than an old age whimper.Forget Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is the best film since the original, and, like its main character, its a dignified Winner.",Rocky Balboa

I don't think that rating this movie 7.9 is honest. The story of Rocky 6 is parallel to Stallone's story: an old boxer, out of the game since some years get the occasion of a come back while his life is flat and out of the game. Almost all movie is a sad poor dialog between Rocky and Paulie (Burt Young) remembering Adrian, no action, nothing. 3 times in this movie there is a scene showing Stallone to the cemetery in front of Adrian's grave. Just at the end there is an old fashion training leading to an old fashion fight, Rocky vs the new young champion. Obviously I'm not saying here how it ends and who will be the winner.

212,joncheskin,Is Rocky Real?,7,1 August 2015,"At first glance, this movie might seem like the most outlandish idea for a film ever conceived. The Rocky series, which began in 1976 and seemed to completely peter out in a poor fifth film, is back with Rocky in his senior years. You might first ask, is there really going to be a fight? A reasonable question, since Rocky is pushing 60. But when a computer simulation of a fight between Rocky and current undefeated champ Mason ""The Line"" Dixon raises questions about who may be the best ever, Dixon's handlers decide that it might be good for the champ's professional image to offer Rocky an exhibition. And then it is game on.This movie should not succeed; for one thing, the premise truly has been beaten to death (sorry for the pun). Stallone understands something, however, that we do not, and it has something to do with autobiographical nature of these films. Stallone has said that he is Rocky, and Rocky's story is his story, retold in a different profession. Stallone's story is remarkable--his roots are not far from the poverty-stricken roots of his character, and in every phase of his life Stallone has faced personal challenges that on the one hand seem remote to us but on the other hand are universal. In this latest episode, the challenge is that of growing old and losing the things you hold dear. Stallone realized this about himself, saw the universality of the idea, and concluded that the time was right for a new Rocky movie.Stallone thinks in this case that the response to these challenges is the same as always--defiance. Stallone rises up to make the movie, Rocky rises up to take the fight against the young champ. The movie also plays with the definition of ""reality"" in interesting ways-- scenes in which Rocky walks around the streets of Philadelphia to be greeted with real onlookers saying ""Welcome back to the neighborhood!"" suggest that Stallone has in some sense created a reality. The fight scene is part of the under-card of a real fight- night, and Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, Michael Buffer and the whole gang from HBO has shown up to do a cameo. Even Mike Tyson is around to taunt the fake champ. The result is satisfying, because Stallone's message is as encouraging as always, and the themes and situations are genuinely new. It is also fair to say that the movie is most like the original of the series, because the human relationships are again very deep. Rocky is seen picking up the pieces after his wife's death as he befriends a bartender in an obviously budding romance, acts as a mentor to her teenage son, tries to repair the relationship with his own son, and manages the heartbreak of difficult times for Paulie. There is plenty here that will seem familiar to the 60-year-old widower, and the emphasis on human drama shows that Rocky succeeds in getting back to his roots.",Rocky Balboa
213,feakes,I got a beast in me and I get so angry..,10,21 June 2016,ROCKY BALBOA is a incredible send off to an icon.Stallone Writes a heart felt ending to the Rocky series .This is perhaps the best in the series it certainly bookmarks ROCKY nicely.Rocky Balboa has a strong plot and its like this. The Current Heavyweight Champion Mason The Line Dixon isn't getting any fans. He fights too quick knocks them out too quick and he is a dirty fighter. Dixon has no heart. He's a angry man and he cares nothing for the fan's opinion. Then a popular sports show does a superfight matching all the Champions of the past into matches and Rocky Balboa is paired against Dixon. the computer has Rocky winning. and this gets people talking.As for Rocky he now owns a restaurant called Adrian's and he spends his time there greeting guests telling stories and taking pictures. Rocky is unhappy. Adrian has died. She developed Cancer and died on him and since then rocky has been a ghost in his own life. His Son Robert is estranged from him. Paulie lives with him but isn't the greatest company. Rocky meets little Marie ( You remember her right ? Little Marie who used to hang out at the Atomic hoagie shop )Marie now bar tends at the lucky seven bar working for Andy these days. Andy lost a leg but still manages the bar. Rocky and Marie start talking and Rocky gives her a ride home. It's a start.Rocky sees the computer fight and begins to Wonder if he could fight again and he begins to get his license to fight back. In a stirring speech Rocky tells off the commission after they deny him and he changes their mind. rocky doesn't want anything big just some local club fights. And then Dixon's people come around and convince Rocky to fight Dixon in Vegas.Rocky's son is mortified everyone is talking about his crazy dad it seems and when people talk about Rocky it ends badly for him. he confronts Rocky and he gets schooled in the art of telling the truth and accepting that he has to be his own person and not blame Rocky for everything.they reconcile and Robert Paulie and Duke begin to train Rocky.Marie and Rocky figure their relationship out rocky is still in love with Adrian BUT it's nice being around Marie she makes Rocky feel better and he makes her feel better so they decide to have a companionship relationship. Then the big fight and Rocky goes out like a gladiator and he teaches Dixon how to be a Champion.Rocky Balboa is the perfect end to the series. you get the sense that for everyone time has moved on but not for Rocky. Then at the end Rocky must acknowledge the fact time has moved on. The most important people in life are gone. Mickey Apollo Creed and Adrian. Life has slowed down and Rocky is now in the twilight of his career. Stallone captures that perfectly. This is how goodbyes are meant to be.,Rocky Balboa
214,LuckyFour-LeafClover,A Knockout,10,10 January 2021,"I vaguely remember when it was announced Stallone was going to do another Rocky movie. I thought the ending product would be something so silly/over the top it would ruin the movies legacy. Stallone has always remained in good shape but still....I was very pleasantly surprised but his film. The film starts off by Rocky morning Adrienne taking away his heart and soul to an extent and essentially him losing a very big part of his life.
To me this film is all about the Rocky theme of life is a battle and keep punching and moving forward.Give it a shot",Rocky Balboa
215,KillerLord,"Now, this is how it ought to end!",10,20 September 2008,"When the original Rocky movie came out, what was the primary message that it packed with it? If you think on my lines, the answer that will come out from you is ""It is not about winning but about standing tall!"" Sometimes, some people tend to call this statement paradoxical. Is not standing tall and winning the same thing? Well, the paradox is resolved beautifully by the first installment in the Rocky series. Rocky leaves the boxing ring tired and exhausted. The announcer does not declare him the winner. Yet it does not matter to him. He had to prove something to himself more than he had to prove to the world. And he did! And it is this feeling that left him standing tall. That feeling of contentment. A feeling that is independent of what the ring announcer says.The second part carried on the message to a good deal but somewhere the whole essence of Rocky was lost in the later movies. And the Rocky saga as such had ended on a very low note in the form of the fifth part which was definitely not a good way of ending the saga of Rocky. The Rocky character inspired me so much. And I was sad that Rocky ended in such a inappropriate manner. And when I heard that the sixth installment was going to come out, I was all ears. I visited the Wikipedia and the IMDb to catch up with the reviews. And the positive reviews attracted me to see this film.And I was delighted. Rocky was back again. And he had come back with all that he had stood for in the first place. No exaggerations! No weird stories. No misplaced role! It came as a perfect package. The fight sequence is one of the most realistic I have seen. The ending is perfect. I shall not directly voice out the ending of the movie but I shall definitely say that the ending of this movie is a perfect tribute to the first installment.What is crisp and perfect about this movie is that it does not fail to surprise you! You see a Rocky that you can believe is the same Rocky you saw in the first installment, only this time he has been transformed due to all those experiences that he has been through. Unlike in the fifth installment, where Rocky behaves as if the the touch of money and fame did not change anything in him, here is a Rocky that clearly shows that life has instilled in him some experiences and he has moved on by absorbing them. He is a Rocky who is deeply affected by his life and especially the loss of his wife.The dialog is beautiful. Stallone gives the perfect script and direction. There are two or three instances where Stallone shows that he is indeed a good writer. And I think the fact that the movie has come out so late is actually good. I am sure that during this period where Stallone had been probably written off and may have gone through some personal experiences himself that could have made him wiser. This wisdom would have given him the precise inspiration needed to create the sixth installment. This picture really shows the personal evolution of Stallone himself.This movie is a must-watch for any Rocky fan. And I think the experience will be better if the memories of Rocky I and Rocky II have not faded away. Hope you enjoy this movie!",Rocky Balboa
216,pootc,"""Stallone ruined Rocky, only to redeem it with Rocky Balboa""",7,25 February 2007,"Not being a real fan of the franchise or Stallone for that matter - but respecting the original film, I saw Rocky Balboa last night and was very happy with the result. The film delivered a real emotional punch and Stallone had a lot invested in this film and was really at the absolute top of his game. Rocky Balboa seems to go back to the original formula of the first film and in many ways is a mirror image of it. We're reminded of his past glory and life on every street corner in this film and the spectacle of fighting evil Russians and so forth is a distant memory (Thank God!). What made the first film so good was that Rocky was a nobody, an underdog who got one chance to make a name for himself, an underdog who busted his butt and stood toe to toe with the heavyweight champion of the world. It was inspiring while the sequels were over-bloated, unoriginal and dragged. The original story should have been the only story. In effect Stallone ruined Rocky, only to redeem it with Rocky Balboa which is a perfect bookend to the original. It maybe a better film too.",Rocky Balboa
217,DarthPaul85,Possibly the best since the first...,8,20 December 2006,"Having recently seen Rocky I through V, I feel justified to say this movie is probably one of the best in the series.To me, this movie felt the most like the first two. The last three movies are about Rocky trying to beat an impossible opponent. This time, the story is more interpersonal, and wisely so. It would be unrealistic to see a 60 year-old man try to get into the ""best shape of his life!"" This movie is about how characters actually feel. We see sides of Rocky we haven't seen since the first movie, and this film is not shy to throw many references to it.Acting-wise, the characters are still fairly consistent, for which the actors deserve some kudos (it's been 15 years since they had to play these characters). Given the series' EXTREMELY long history (30 years), I really enjoyed the ""where are they now"" aspects of the film. It is a believable conclusion to the story.Sure, there are some plot-lines that kind of fall through, the story is fairly simple, and if you've seen any other Rocky movie, you might be able to predict most of it. Still, this movie was a pleasant trip down memory lane, and a good occasion to reflect on how much can change in a lifetime. And of course, who can resist the classic Rocky soundtrack.",Rocky Balboa
218,markymark70,Disappointed,7,24 January 2007,"I am a great fan of Stallone's all through the years and loved his Rocky/Rambo characters. The 80's was his time and he made a hell of a lot of money and some very bad films too.In 1976 Rocky won the Best Film Oscar (rather surprisingly) which set Stallone up for a lifetime of movie stardom. not that he didn't make a few dollars along the way but he never really realised his acting potential.Rocky Balboa was yet another opportunity for people to pour scorn over his ailing career - let's put it this way, this was the first time i'd seen Stallone in the cinema for well over 15 years (could even be longer).Is the film any good? Yes and no.It does hark back to the original and focuses on Rocky's life and attitudes rather than boxing. There are some nice moments (Rocky reminiscing over Adrian and where they used to go when they first met) and some good solid messages (life is hard but you've gotta move on). But, and it pains me to say this, those messages are poorly expressed via the screenplay. Stallone is no doubt a talented screenwriter but he has been a little lazy on this one I'm afraid. Scenes jump from one premise to another without much knitting together and there are quite a few scenes in there that are not required at all. The character of Steps for example could have been cut out altogether as he brings nothing to the table and was irrelevant for the story progression.The first hour of the film is slow, meandering and a little boring to be brutally honest. Nothing of much note happens but when something does - the speed with which Stallone deals with it is frighteningly quicker than his left jab. The application for a 58 year old man to get a boxing license for example is rushed through and even though on film he is rejected for a license - he suddenly ends up with the all clear? Plus, his medical records are now fine - whereas in Rocky V he supposedly had brain problems.It's okay to go back to the original film for inspiration but to almost re-create shots from it is a tired way out. The meat punching, the running up the steps, Paulie getting some money from the fight out of sponsorship.... all been used before - why use them again? The fight at the end of the movie was in my opinion well put together though. It looked not like a movie fight but like a fight you would actually pay to watch on TV. It had that realism about it in the way they broadcast the footage, the entrance of both fighters and the general build up.In summation - this film holds an unusual position in that even though you know it is a clunky and not well put together effort, you still WANT to like it. Maybe it is Stallone's likability or even Rocky's personal charm - but you end up wanting to like the movie despite its faults. And that's exactly what happened with me.",Rocky Balboa
219,HiddenVoice,"Eats Lightning but doesn't really crap thunder.But, it's still a surprise.A Rocky for the next generation.",7,16 December 2006,"Rocky was the inspiration for many.It was the ultimate underdog story.It was a touching portrait of a loser,a bum, who gets a chance ,by freak luck, to compete with the world champion and prove that he's no bum.I really did shed some tears for Rocky as it touched me.I saw myself in him,one man's struggle and fears to prove his worth and to prove to the world that he's not a loser.That anything is possible if you try,and that everyone deserves a chance.The innocence of that character matched Stallone's portrayal of Rocky so well that you see Stallone in Rocky.And people connect with Rocky because it told their story about struggle in life,about their love and will to become somebody.It was the right movie to inspire people.What was so phenomenal about that film was that Stallone based it on his life and his struggle that reached out to the audience.He was Rocky,the underdog.His story is the rags-to-riches story.He showed his life to us,and the lives of many underdogs out there,looking for just one chance to prove what they can do.And he overcame an even bigger obstacle than the character,when he went on to nab the best actor/writer nods and winning the film the best picture beating high profile films of that year.That was a triumph for Rocky and Stallone.I weeped for him,for both his struggle and triumph to go the distance and hold on.I loved it and it gave me hope and inspired me to chase my dream.Rocky was in my memories....But what followed after that was Hollywood sucking the life out of Rocky and making him just another fighter in the sequels.They should've stopped after the first sequel,which was fine,but they just kept degrading and degenerating his legacy in the sequels.Well,blame Stallone.Rocky owns a restaurant now,named after his late wife.Rocky mourns the loss of his wife.He's lonely again,even lonelier than the first film.He visits her grave from time to time,like he visits her pet shop.Paulie's still the same old Paulie.Rocky sees a computer fight that pits him against a present champion and shows Rocky triumphant.This ignites the passion and determination in Rocky to fight again in the ring.Everyone think he's lost it but Rocky moves on to prove that impossible is nothing.He gets the support from Paulie and Marie,the girl from the original film that Rocky kindly walked back home and gave advices.But Rocky misses Adrian and doesn't know if he could do it without her.But he gives it a shot to go the distance and tries to risk his life for the love of the game and for Adrian.And you can pretty much predict what happens in the end after the rigorous training,if you've seen the first film.I would suggest that you watch the original and its sequel and skip 3,4,5, and watch this for a very satisfying ,if not rewarding, conclusion.It's worth it.It's Stallone's show all the way.I think he makes better films when he's not so famous and all forgotten.He didn't take a high salary for this film ,and why would he?I mean who'd pay him another 20 million to do another dud?.He proves,like Rocky,that he can go on forever.The spirit of the original echoes throughout the film.You see Stallone in Rocky once again.And I must say,it's the most faithful and respectful sequel to the original.Rocky's only grown older but hasn't lost any of the charm and innocence.Stallone manages to pull off some very touching and emotional scenes.One really memorable scene is where he tries to secure his license for boxing.He proves that he can still act,after all those films he's done that brought him back to the rags from the riches.It's somewhat a surprise with only half-successful results.It certainly ain't going to Oscars or anything.But for the sake of old memories,it's worth a visit.I watched the original before I went to see this,because both films have something in common.This could've been a great film or as good as the original,had it been written by someone else.But with a good start and build up it descends into the predictable.It's sometimes cheesy and laughable if you take the story and the set up too seriously.And by the end it gets so predictable and obvious that it makes you want go back home and watch the original for full satisfaction.The writing is weak,that I can assure you but the spirit is high.There are some flashbacks worth remembering.But what succeeds here is Sly's dedication.It could've been a lot worse.Watching so many films about Sports coming out that are all the same,Stallone goes against that formula (kind of) and tries to present Rocky in a different manner.The rest of the cast is fine,nothing special to mention,except Burt Young's faithful reprising performance.The performances are all decent.Sly has really has learned a lot about boxing these past years after not doing another Rocky movie.I can tell you that you will enjoy and appreciate the amount of realism and intensity that went into the final showdown.At 60 he's still got it.And that's the only fight you'll see throughout the film.It was satisfying and well executed,but too predictable and borrows too much from the original.He may just fly high again at the box office.But I'm sure he's gonna fly in audiences' memories now ,as the legend once again tries to prove that impossible is nothing and restore hope in all those underdogs and people who need inspiration.I have great respect for Rocky since the original film and still do.Rocky is still an iconic figure in America culture,and Stallone just makes him fresh in our memories again.This film could've been great but in the end it's above average and decent.It is well intentioned and better than most sports dramas.It eats lighting,but it doesn't crap thunder.Still,do watch this film,just for once,just for Rocky.Once is enough and you will be satisfied with this final chapter and fine conclusion to the Rocky saga.Good luck Flying high now.6.7/10 B- 3/5",Rocky Balboa
220,pookey56,humble balboa,10,27 December 2006,"well well well well well....this Rocky is good. It was good enough to, perhaps not forget, but forgive the Rocky win in 1976 over the brilliant NETWORK. once again, this is a simple story, touching upon the very best in mankind. We have a young, real boxer, who is not demonetized at all, and listens intently to his older mentor, much the same way Rocky listened to his, the late great Burgess Meredith. This time, we have a world champion criticized for never having been challenged for his crown. And then we have Rocky, remembered and respected by his home town Philadelphians, and acknowledged as one of the foremost champions of his era. But he's aging, and almost sixty. He has lost his beloved Adrian...it leaves me wondering why Talia Shire did not return for this final installment, and also wondering whether she wishes she had done the film now...Rocky is still in mourning for her, and this is touchingly brought across by Stallone without a bunch of hokey malarkey. In fact, Sylvester Stallone is the best i've ever seen in a film he has starred in. His character is kind, and humane. He rescues old, discarded dogs left to their fate; he offers a teen a job to help occupy his time in better ways, and helps the teens mother too, his new love interest, who, amazingly, was in the original Rocky. He feeds a former boxer in his restaurant, named ADRIANS (of course)and later lets him work in the kitchen, because he's ready to, and he strives to be a good father to his son, who is estranged from him because of ""this big shadow"" which was cast over him by his father's fame. a pretty selfish reason to avoid his dad but not atypical and very human. So why did Rocky fight this final, ""exhibition"" fight? His character had nothing left to prove, although he claims to have some kind of fire in his ""basement"". i believe that this film was for Sylvester Stallone, looking to put a classy closure to his Rocky franchise, the first one made on a shoe string budget; and also to regain his own self respect as an actor and a film maker, and a writer. It was treat seeing Burt Young again, who was so great in that short turn he did on the SOPRANOS as the murderous old school family member with the bad lungs. New comer Antonio Tarver was great too. In fact, this entire film was a treat. It was simple, heart felt, sentimental, nostalgic, well edited, and had a great score. It was over before i knew it. Rocky didn't care whether he had won the fight officially or not, because he was already a winner when he entered the ring, and a bigger one when he left. bye Rocky. Thanks for all those years.",Rocky Balboa
221,pugheaven,Superb and the film that Rocky V should have been!,10,27 December 2006,"Well, what do I think? Defo not a disappointment, in fact, I'd say it easily matches the first 4 Rocky's.As soon as the into music starts, hairs on your arms and neck stand up... emotions start... and we're away! It's Balboa time!What we have here is Sly, just wanting to put Rocky to bed once and for all, with style and dignity... and he achieves it... JUST!!! The plot, although a bit weak is fantastic, why? Because it's new boy against Old School Balboa... as soon as you see Rocky watching the TV with Paulie and it's got the computer simulation between Dixon and Balboa, the hairs stand up on your neck!!! The first 60 minutes is slightly too long, I think they could've cut 10 minutes from this section.This could then have been used on the training montage, which I found slightly too short. Shame, as it's the main bit of the film... apart from the fight at the end. We needed more muscle etc etc, and at least another 2 minutes of Sly shots... shame.As for the climax, well the fight is probably well up there with the greats! it's realistic, no thunder claps when hitting as in Rocky III, you hear the slap of the gloves. Also, it shows Rocky as old, and slower, they don't try to make him look unrealistic and fast... the fight is FANTASTIC.So, does Sly look the part? He looks older, yeah, of course he does... both facially and physically... however, the work he's put into his body is awesome for a 60 year old, and he looks fantastic not letting his fans down! As he knows he can no longer be ""ripped"" simply because of age, he's gone for size in this film, and it works!!! Well Done Sly, You're a LEGEND! So, there we have it, had a tear in the eye during this one, a masterpiece? No, but very nearly and certainly a perfect finish to a selection of the greatest films ever released.The acting is good, although I'd say Paulie is slightly ""odd"" compared to his previous films... somehow not quite as natural!!! Sly is once again outstanding, although, I think he could have cut down on the preaching in the film...ROCKY, you are the GREATEST!!! Thanks to SLY for finishing this series correctly... Cheers Pug",Rocky Balboa
222,cool_cool_1,"Don't believe the hype, a big disappointment!!!!",3,20 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa (2006) was a movie i was so looking forward to, i'm a massive fan of the Rocky series, as most males are, but after coming out of the cinema, i felt empty and disappointed with this movie.This Rocky film is very slow paced, with loads of scenes of Rocky having flashbacks and memories of Adrian and loads of pointless scenes of him in his restaurant telling his old stories!! The whole movie is a build up to his big fight with current unbeaten champion Mason Dixon (Tarver), Rocky decides to bring himself out of retirement after seeing a computer fight pitting himself against Dixon, with him winning the fight!! One of the movies problems is they didn't build up the Dixon character at all, he was flat and boring, he wasn't a ruthless killing machine that made Drago so good in Rocky IV, he was weak to be honest, with Tarver being a real life boxer, his acting abilities were always gonna be limited! and finally we get to the fight itself, which had afew good moments, but generally it was a 10 round slapfest, one of the worst fights of the whole Rocky series to be honest, with a highly disappointing outcome too!! The rating of 7.6 on here is very generous in my opinion, i give Rocky Balboa 5/10 and thats being kind, where was all the action and drama Stallone???",Rocky Balboa
223,editor-299,Not as bad as it should have been,6,20 December 2006,"In a classic example of a movie being better than it should have been, the sixth ""Rocky"" film is really not that terrible. Although certain reviewers on this Web site who claim its as good as the first one cannot be serious (or know much about movies, for that matter).It certainly isn't great  like the first one  but it is fairly well done with an interesting storyline and, of course, an exciting pugilistic finish.Now most people will not really understand the premise unless they have some sort of knowledge of the famous 1969 staged (via computer analysis) match between former undefeated heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali (who at the time had been stripped of his title because he refused induction into the military).The computer picked Marciano to win on an 11th round knockout; and since both men needed the money, they acted out the choreography the computer told them to. I saw the televised version in the 1970s, and it is still intriguing to this day.Using this premise, Rocky Balboa has the former champ (Sylvester Stallone) - now a restaurant owner - featured in a virtual slug-fest with tough but boring current titleholder, Mason ""The LIne"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver, a contestant on Stallone's TV program, ""The Contender"") on ESPN.The video game Rocky clobbers the unlikable and uninspiring champion; causing media speculation that the Italian Stallion could still win back the crown.Of course, he's over 60, so a comeback is extremely unlikely, but since Rocky still has the ""eye of the tiger"" and a ""beast within"" him, he begins training again. This makes George Foreman (who recaptured the heavyweight crown age 45 in 1994) seem like a spring chicken.And despite his gruff brother-in-law Paulie's (Burt Young) advice against it, Rocky appeals to the Pennsylvania Boxing Commission for a license; at first he is denied, but his South Philly charm wins the stoic panel over and he is allowed to get back into the ring.Because no one is excited about Dixon's upcoming bouts, his management forces him into an exhibition with  you guessed it  Rocky Balboa. After this decision, we are given another boxing montage in which the over-the-hull pug gets back in shape over a few minutes and a loud, popular song.Meanwhile, Stallone has a tender relationship with Maria (Geraldine Hughes)  the young girl he tried to straighten out in the very first film, in 1976  and her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III). His own son (Milo Ventimiglia), now a stockbroker, also seeks a reconciliation with his old man, as well.But no one will really come to the cinemaplex for this subplot. The special 10-round match is what gets the juices flowing. It sticks to the standard ""Rocky"" formula, but with more cuts and quicker camera work. It is fairly exciting, however, and overall, ""Rocky Balboa"" is certainly better than ""Rocky IV"" and ""V,"" as if that is saying very much.",Rocky Balboa
224,IamtheRegalTreatment,Almost what we expected.,5,19 December 2006,"What did you really expect from Rocky Balboa? Hopefully not too much, just like I did. I'm not a huge Rocky fan, but if you are this movie will be fun for you. It shows many past memories of each Rocky movie throughout the story. For not being a big fan, it was still a fun movie to watch.The story goes that Rocky loses his wife Adrian and is going through hard times. So, he finally decides that in life you always move forward, and it's hard to hold on to everything you love. He then decides to start fighting again. The current undefeated heavyweight champion, Dixon, chooses to have a final fight with Rocky for publicity means.The movie plot is actually very good for Stallone's standards; I thought it was going to be short and stupid with a lot of fight scenes. I'm glad he used his knowledge to make a creative movie. Overall I gave the movie 5 out of 10 stars. The reason is it's like a sequel that was not needed to be done, and because Stallone did not have to do much with the movie. Since there were so many Rocky films, he used the previous stuff in the current film. Nothing is really new.If this was not a Rocky film, and the plot was ""a retired boxer wants to get back in the ring one last time to re-live the sport he once loved"", then I would watch it and probably rate it a lot higher than a 5 out of 10. But be honest, this isn't considered a great movie.",Rocky Balboa
225,dean2900,What Rocky 5 should have been,7,22 December 2006,"I find it almost unbelievable that I am saying this but Rocky Balboa is a good movie. Rocky IV was bad and Rocky V was just horrible and a terrible note to end the acclaimed series on.This movie may have been made 10 years too late but it is the perfect end to the Rocky Series.I laughed when I heard this was being made. I guess you never know until you see the movie.The story goes back to the basics. It focuses on Rocky's life after the death of Adrian, his son's jealousy of living in the Shadow of his father, and Rocky's sad life running a restaurant where he tells patrons about his past glory.Rocky is granted a license and gets an exhibition fight against Mason ""The Line"" Dixon who is 33-0 with 30 KOs and never has gone the distance.Everyone things the exhibition is a joke and HBO boxing analyst Larry Merchant comments this should be called an Execution instead of an exhibition.I will not comment on the fight but I think anyone could guess that Rocky doesn't get knocked out early or get beat soundly. Does he win or lose? You will have to see the film or ask someone else as I don't want to ruin the ending.This is a good movie. I give a 7 out of 10. I considered an 8 out of 10 but since this is the sixth film and most of the territory has been covered, I had to drop it a point. However, if you like the Rocky Franchise or sports films, underdog films, and such then this is a must see.And it was refreshing to hear the crowd cheering Rocky, Rocky! Dean",Rocky Balboa
226,sullibrandon,A Satisfying Conclusion to the Rocky Saga,7,28 December 2006,"What? A new Rocky movie? After four flops, each one worse than the one before it, doesn't Stallone know that he shouldn't mess with what was the amazingness of the 1976 original? One would think that he would know better, but apparently he doesn't. And let's all be glad of this. Rocky Balboa is a triumphant, if flawed, achievement that truly captures the spirit of the film we all loved back in 1976, a spirit fans and critics have been craving alike while they suffered through the horrible Rocky's II-V. It's a much welcome film and will have you cheering for Rocky in the ring just like in the old days.The movie shows us Rocky in this day and age, sixteen years after the last one (1990). Rocky is retired, now running a restaurant called Adrian's, named after his wife, who apparently passed away between now and the last movie. He now is a famous superstar legend, and everywhere he goes people ask him for his autograph. His son, Rocky Jr., lives in his shadow. The film's focus on heart and soul are one of its great strengths. It doesn't feel cheesy - rather, it feels heartfelt. Rocky is the same big lovable giant that we knew from the first film, as Stallone stays true to the original character. One day, on TV, Rocky sees a virtual fight that crowns him as the champion over the reigning heavyweight champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. The movie tries to show his perspective a little, but the actor's less-than-stellar acting just makes it kind of boring. Moving along, the virtual fight puts Rocky into the mood to start fighting again, despite his age. Then the movie takes off.This is not a movie about the ultimate underdog taking on the heavyweight champion of the world. This movie is about Rocky's decision to start fighting again, and how it will affect him and the people around him. The movie's journey from when Rocky makes the decision to when he finally starts fighting is beautifully well done. Rocky must wrestled with, on one side, people telling him he should go for it, while on the other, people are telling him he's crazy and calling him nothing more than a joke. He also must wrestle with his grief over Adrian being gone.Of course, the storyline of the movie is very predictable. There are no real surprises, so what makes it good is its heart and soul, and its fine performances. Stallone has never been known for his acting skills, and no matter what you may think about him personally, you've got to admire the way he portrays Rocky. It's perfect, spot-on in every way. He eclipses everyone else in the movie, all of whom seem to be doing sub-par acting. Sure, they're good, but they're just so dull compared to Stallone. Another weakness of the film is how the musical montage is the only training that Rocky goes through. It would have been nice to see better pacing - some training before, and some training after. But it just crams it all in to the montage, which, to the film's credit, looks amazing. It soars with the inspiring music of the 1976 original, and will make you want to jump in your seat and cheer.Rocky Balboa could easily be viewed as disgusting cheese trash, not even worth watching for the hilarity. But if you loved the first Rocky, you'll probably love this one too. There are numerous references to the first film, giving this movie a kind of nostalgic feeling to it. One could call these references contrived and just put there to tug some heartstrings, but I feel it was a smart choice and it was a very good way of capturing the original spirit. There are, thankfully, not very many references to the in-between disasters. The final fight, between Rocky and Mason, is brilliantly filmed and expertly paced to maximize tension.I was never a very big fan of Rocky. I've only seen the first and fourth film, though I know enough about film in general to have heard about how horrible the other three were. I watched Rocky (loving it) the day before I walked into the theater to watch Rocky Balboa. I didn't have the sour taste in my mouth from previous movies, and I was consciously comparing it to the first one as I watched. The two go perfectly hand in hand together. Rocky Balboa, admittedly, is a flawed film, but it's such a triumphant finale for the series that it would have been a travesty to not have it released. If nothing else, this movie deserves praise for the way it went against all odds to skyrocket above almost everyone's expectations, including mine. This is the movie that Sylvester Stallone has owed us ever since Rocky II was released. The series needed a proper ending, and this movie is it. With glitches here and there, and a storyline that is not really that impressive, what Rocky Balboa does best is staying true to the spirit of the character. This movie is Rocky at his very best, the Rocky that we know and love, the Rocky that we want. ROCK-EE! ROCK-EE! ROCK-EE!!",Rocky Balboa
227,dgrahamwatson,"""Maybe not a knockout - - - - - - - but on points, - - - I'd give it the thumbs up!""",7,5 December 2006,"I've been able to see this before it's release date so I'll avoid giving too much away in this review. To start with when I heard that they were going to make a sixth Rocky movie you didn't have to be a die hard fan to wonder what were they thinking about, particularly 15 years after the last horrible outing! After 30 years since the original ROCKY was released one could only wonder what else they could conjure up after such a long hiatus? Yet this movie was not bad and it's important to stress that on a number of levels. This rendition of Rocky is true to the previous ones as again he is the underdog, a former champ who is encouraged to come out of obscurity and take on the current champ despite having been retired for 20 years.Just to recap to the earlier movies for the moment, in the original ROCKY, in some sort of bizarre publicity stunt Rocky Balboa was plucked up from a short list of ""bum of the month contenders"" to leap frog genuine challengers for a crack at the undisputed heavy weight title. Although he falls short, because of the effort and the show that he puts on, the public demand a rematch and consequently sequel to ROCKY is made and so on. It's important to remember that in the 1970's the American public craved for there to be white heavyweight boxing champion so when the original ROCKY was released not only was it contemporary but captured the imagination of the public at the time. Apollo Creed as the champion was obviously modeled on the brash, cocky Muhammad Ali who you either loved or hated.Also it's worth noting that in the 1970's and 80's boxing enthusiasts often wondered who would win in a fictional fight between the 1950's champion Rocky Marciano and the 1970's champ Muhammad Ali. Therefore it was no coincidence the name 'Rocky'was used in the 70's, but now today in ROCKY BALBOA we are now asking who would win in 2006, Rocky from the 70's and 80's or Mason Dixon from the 2000's? The question in this movie is actually more like a Rocky Marciano v's Ali now than it was in the 70's!Another point worth mentioning is that in the original the conceited Apollo Creed was a flashy, arrogant, publicity seeking showman, but more importantly he was human. By the time of Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago in ROCKY'S III and IV respectively the Italian Stallion was up against fighters that did not seem to be human. They were void of feelings had no family and their physical prowess and abilities were so advanced that they seemed more like comic book or video game characters. In this movie Mason Dixon to a large extent returns the heavyweight champion to a more believable human role, although contemporary for 2006 i.e. athletic, brash and mean! I give credit to the writers here and to a large extent this is where the movie worked! I don't know if it was a coincidence or if it was part of the thinking but ROCKY BALBOA was fortunate enough to be released at a time when the heavyweight boxing scene itself is in a shambles and resembles a three ring circus. From blown up middleweights to an alphabet soup of nobodies in their late 30's right up to a 7 foot Neanderthal lookalike that is totally useless,--- heavyweight boxing has never been more of a joke! In a time when top athletes in their respective sports are stronger, faster or bigger and more powerful than there peers from earlier decades, heavyweight boxing is about the only sport to have regressed. The skill levels and talent are so much poorer than their counter parts in the 1970's and 80's that none of them could even carry Muhammad Ali or Larry Holmes jock strap's when they were at their best! The International powers that be have in there zeal for money have butchered the world heavy weight boxing scene so badly that its turned into a freak show. Thus the idea of a former champion 25 years past his best challenging for a world title is not as far fetched as it once might have been! This movie will have it's critics and while it is certainly not flawless I see no reason why this movie should be lambasted as it no doubt will be. At the very least it stands out from being better than 90% of the movies that are released today, many which are simply dreadful. If old 1960's,70's and 80's TV shows are revived on the big screen for the movie industries indulgence or else the public are fed an endless list of remakes why not another Rocky movie! The dialogue and writing while not great was no worse anything else I've seen recently and the production and camera angles were good. It's slow in certain areas particularly at the beginning but over all a nostalgic effort which tried to capture the theme of the earlier rocky movies. Apparently Sylvester Stallone was never happy about ROCKY V and for years the memory of it tormented him, well I think this one will have exorcised that demon ,a much better effort overall. Check it out!",Rocky Balboa
228,LeroyBrown-2,The perfect bookend to one of filmdom's greatest character. Just throw away the middle.,8,14 January 2009,"To me the perfect 'Rocky' box set would consist of the original film and this one. The ones in the middle became caricatures of the original, getting worse in each installment and turning one of the greatest story that the movies ever saw into a bad laughing stock. The other sequels were mostly about the fight with the private life of Rocky just filler until we get to the good stuff. But this, hopefully, last installment is the opposite.Sylvester Stallone wrote this one as he did with the others and of course he played the title character. This time we see Rocky Balboa as an older man, retired from the sport he loved and running a small albeit successful restaurant in the same old neighborhood. The restaurant is named after his late wife Adrian. And every night he would go in there put on a jacket and regale the customers with his stories. Some of the regulars would join him as he recites the last line.What we see in this movie is a lot of humanity, which was an element in short supply in the other sequels. We see a man in the autumn of his life basically content in his world. He has achieved the greatest glory that one could ever want and now basically living in its ghost, yet for the most part he is living with it in the most gracious way. In one of the most touching scene in any movie we see Rocky, on the anniversary of Adrian's death, visit all the places he went to with Adrian on their first date.We see a strained relationship with his son, who is smarter, more educated and had it not been for boxing, probably more successful. We also see a potential new romance for the Rock, a woman from his past a long time ago. And of course you can not make a movie about Rocky Balboa without a big fight. The set up, how it happened, the outcome is not as important in this movie yet the fight sequence is just as exciting as in the other sequels. What's important is that the fight is a metaphor for the movie and Rocky's life. He's a guy, not dealt with the best cards and have to suffer some of life's most horrible blows and yet come out standing on his feet.Yes I know the fight situation is a bit ludicrous, but let's face it how many times have you seen a great athlete hanging in there for one more taste of glory even though he's well past his prime. (Brett Favre anybody?). I like how in the end of the fight as they went through the tunnel, Rocky hugged each one of his entourage as if to say thank you for being part of my journey. All I can say is despite the sequels thank you Sly for the first film and this one.",Rocky Balboa
229,eckhouse24,Rocky Balboa-AWESOME,10,6 May 2007,"***1/2 out of **** In 1976, Sylvester Stallone brought the character of Rocky Balboa to life in the film ""Rocky."" It was the story of a local underdog who received a once in a life time chance for the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship against Apollo Creed. But within that plot, ""Rocky"" was a love story between to people. The film was a major hit and sparked 4 sequels ending with the not so good ""Rocky V."" 30 Years later, Sylvester Stallone brings Rocky Balboa back to the big screen after 17 years in the new film ""Rocky Balboa,"" the fifth sequel. Some people have poked fun of this idea of an over the hill boxer fighting in the ring but what most people don't realize is that ""Rocky Balboa"" is not a movie about boxing, as was the case with the original film. This story is about a man, Rocky, who must come to terms with moving on in life.As most know, Adrian Balboa is all ready deceased when the film begins. When we first see Rocky, he is a man living day to day, without the love of his wife. His son, Robert, is tired of being known as Rocky's son and pushes Rocky away any chance he gets. Rather then moving on, Rocky is stuck in a moment of yesterday rather then today and tomorrow. He relives the moments of his past year to year on the anniversary of Adrain's death. On one stop of the tour, Rocky meets up with an old neighborhood ""friend,"" Maria, and a relationship is born. With this new relationship, Rocky begins to live again. He begins to bond with her son. Rocky even seems to be interested in this woman romantically though his heart still remains with Adrian.There is a boxing match in this film that features Rocky vs Mason Dixon, played by real life boxer Antonio Tarver. Though and exhibition match, the fight sparks interest with he people. My only issue with this film is that Antonio Tarver's Mason Dixon reminds me more of an NBA star than a boxer. He is not a fearsome opponent but then again, maybe that is the way Sly intended it. In the end, I think Rocky's opponent is life and the fact that life must move on.This film works because it has heart. We are easily seduced by these characters. Rocky and Paulie (Stallone and Burt Young) have awesome on screen moments and jokes and the chemistry between Rocky and Maria (played by Geraldine Hughes) is perfect. It is almost as great as the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian in the first film. And though the film moves rather slow, it's OK because the characters are so charming that you won't notice it as much. And if one recalls, the first two films moved rather slow. And when ""Gonna Fly Now"" hits and the training montage begin, it makes the waiting all worth it.The final fight at the end may be the best one because it does tell a story. It keeps you involved the whole way through. I won't give away the ending but I do not think anyone will be disappointed.This is a finale to the series that I believe everyone envisioned ""Rocky V"" to be. It is charming, delightful, exciting, funny and moving all at the same time. Most of all, it has heart, which is what is expected out of a Rocky film.",Rocky Balboa
230,DjfunkmasterG,Rocky Balboa - Still packing a punch 30 years later,8,20 December 2006,"When you mention Rocky Balboa to some people they roll their eyes in disgust and imagine an aging action hero trying to retain, more like regain his once Superstar status by reviving a series that ended horribly in 1990. However, that where the sucker punch comes into play.The biggest problem with the Rocky series in the sequels were that the story hyped up Stallone to his stardom status in the real world. That hype took away the human element Rocky once had in the original two films. Now here comes the 6th and final entry where a computer simulation pits the current champ against a once prime boxing machine from back in the day. This simulation project Rocky to be the better boxer if age and time weren't the factor. With talk about the simulation brewing in the sports world, corporate promoters latch onto this and decide to use it to promote an exhibition match between the current champ and Rocky Balboa.Now Rocky himself thought of getting back in the game because of the hype, but only to fight locally, however his intentions are known pretty much from the point he applies for his license, and this is where the film falters a tad. You really get the feeling like mentioned above about him applying for his license when comparing it to asking people if they would see Rocky 6.One great thing about Rocy 6 is the fact it brings the human element about Rocky back to the story. not the superstar Rocky, but the guy who just rolled with the punches life dealt him and kept his head up no matter what. Even the champion of boxing, played by Antonio carver is kept human... not over hyped in anyway so it made the film much more enjoyable.The only fault Rocky 6 has is the slow start and abrupt ending. Just when the film begins to pick-up and gets going it ends fast which is a shame because during the boxing match I wanted to jump out of my seat and scream ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY, just when I was ready to do it the fight ends and the credits begin to roll.One thing Rocky 6 didn't lose was the underdog storyline and the film has a positive message to promote to everyone in that don't count yourself out... it's not the punches life gives it how hard a punch you can take. This film is enjoyable on many levels and is a fitting end to one of the greatest underdog stories ever told.7.5 out of 10",Rocky Balboa
231,Klickberg,It's been over for far too long,1,22 December 2006,"Many are saying that, if nothing else, ROCKY BALBOA is, at bottom, a fitting conclusion to the series. I defy this and assert that the ""fitting conclusion"" occurred at the end of ROCKY I. That is how this story ends--the true underdog tale, the modern-day fable of an Average Joe with a little something extra-special keeping his flames burning to stay the full 15 rounds...and lose. All the rest after that is merely a half-baked hodgepodge of Sylvester Stallone's self-aggrandizing hallucinations.There's talk around the campfire that the impetus for Sly to waste our time with ROCKY BALBOA and the upcoming RAMBO IV: PEARL OF THE COBRA stems from his wanting to at long last produce his baby, his Edgar Allen Poe biopic. If true, this is an iniquitous shame. As with the character of Rocky himself, Stallone needs to realize it is over, and it's been over for some time now.This disjointed string of forced performances, rampant narcissism on the part of Sly, and hackneyed clichés in perpetua is trite where it's supposed to be inspiring and ultimately dull where it should be fun. Far worse than you could ever imagine, ROCKY BALBOA is not worth today's exorbitant ticket prices even for a gag or a giggle at campy nostalgia or cheesy kitsch.",Rocky Balboa
232,amraampk,i waited for this final round so long,9,26 December 2006,"He ' s back. The greatest underdog story of our times is back for one final round and in the end it triumphed again in its last contest. For me the journey with the rocky begin on 1st april 1983. When i was a 9 yrs old boy and i watched rocky 3 on my cousin' s birthday , that was really an april fool coz i was expecting a different movie with the same name. But that april fool really proved a life long charm and inspiration the time i watched any one of the rocky series. This time sylvester stallone has again reprised his role once again with the same passion , and glory he used to depict in early movies. He didn't disappointed his fans from portraying the rocky balboa in the same charismatic rocky balboa with in depth performance both as an actor and director. Burt young also made a very impressive come back in role as paulie. The only thing which was missed in this movie was adrian. But that doesn't effected much on the story coz in my opinion it again provided rocky the desire to be what he used to be , a fighter with the heart of a champion. It was really heartning to see that at this stage of life when rocky has lost his wife ,he s alone , his son doesn't have time and attention for his old man, his old buddies are gone too , the opportunity knocks at his door once again and he doesn't want to lose what he has got this time, his heart of a true fighter. I waited impatiently for this movie and finally i watched it which really is an inspiration in all aspects. This is a must see movie for all the rocky fans. Don't miss it.",Rocky Balboa
233,shattenjager777,"Unfortunately, it ranks alongside ""Rocky V""",2,7 May 2007,"""Rocky Balboa"" has an interesting premise: What happens to an icon as he ages? However, it decides, quickly and simply, ""nothing."" Then, the film descends into an almost nightmarish list of clichés that never manage to be endearing as the first four films were. It uses its own filmic past not as a stepping stone or a touchstone in its exploration but as a crutch, recreating in less dramatic fashion the best elements of the original film while never matching its charm.Beginning with the basics, the plot is outlandish, but so is professional boxing, so that's not really an issue. The dialogue is loaded with attempts to create the sort of aphoristic tone of the first film, though this time they come across as more sanctimonious than sincere. The characters, outside of Rocky himself, also never find any development. Still, the film does perhaps expose more than any of the previous films what an odd mixture of sweetness and violence Rocky really is, and on that level it should be commended.The acting, one of the saving graces of the first film, is across-the-board bad, though the reasoning differs. Stallone is for the most part decent, though the somewhat new incarnation of Rocky as Street Philosopher stretches him to the breaking point. Burt Young is as he usually is, which is to say a mixture of over-the-top histrionics and woefully inadequate performance. The other characters really require very little to no acting, with only Geraldine Hughes shining (and that perhaps only because of a natural charisma, sweetness, and beauty). The other characters are not developed enough for the acting to require anything, so the performances are decent enough for what they are. The acting also causes a shared problem for the last three ""Rocky"" films in that the wonderfully charismatic and interesting Burgess Meredith is no longer present and none of the other actors has the energy he had to uplift the film.Stallone the director also makes a number of questionable decisions. The final fight scene, instead of following the films' tried and true standard of being shot as though inside the ring and leaving it once in a while in order to give us some outside perspective, is shot mostly as though it is a television broadcast, complete with enough HBO logos to kill a rhinoceros. The one advantage of this presentation is the presence of Max Kellerman as a ringside announcer. He brings an element of fun and energy that the film desperately needs at this point. Stallone also shortens both the fight and the lead-up to it from their lengths in the previous films, presumably in order to focus more on his character study. However, Stallone does end the film very wisely, mimicking the original quite nicely while not copying it as much of the rest of the film unfortunately does.Oddly, one of the film's problems is also its score. Bill Conti, the original film's composer (and thus composer of the ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme) is an excellent composer who has done top-notch work repeatedly over his career, but ""Rocky Balboa"" is a jumbled mix of his much better earlier work reworked in order to fit the emotions of the scenes but often not quite working so. ""Gonna Fly Now,"" even slowed way down, does not sound sad, despite his attempts to make it do so.Overall, ""Rocky Balboa"" is a terrible disappointment of a film. Fans of the series will find some interesting elements, but all others will find the film tedious and boring and even the aforementioned fans might. Too much of the film is recycled from earlier films without even being reworked and that which isn't is just uninteresting. To be avoided, though the ending is certainly a more appropriate exit for Rocky than ""Rocky V"" was.",Rocky Balboa
234,concrndone,Let's compare Rocky Balboa to Rocky,5,25 June 2021,"Rocky:
Rocky, a Down but not quite out street bum who collects debts for petty loan sharks (and can't even do that well) is given the opportunity of a lifetime to challenge the world heavyweight boxing camp, Apollo Creed. Generally not taken seriously by anyone apart from his emotionally-abused girlfriend, this fight gives him the opportunity to show not just the world who he really is but to show himself who he really is and what he's made of. The Rocky at the end of the fight is a very different Rocky to the one who started. Not only does he gain the respect of the audience but he now has self-respect yet all he has eyes for is Adrian in a touching finale.Rocky Balboa:
Well-respected and comfortable running a restaurant in the name of his now-deceased wife, a somewhat still restless Rocky Is given the opportunity to step back in the ring and challenge the current world heavyweight champ Mason 'the line' Dixon. The world already knows what Rocky can do (in his prime) and so does Rocky but it's not enough. So desperate for public validation he's determined to go that extra mile even if he knows he might get hurt or that it hurts his son in the process. For Rocky, the love of the audience is what's most important. The Rocky at the end of this fight is still the same as the one started. Only if a little more reassured he still has the love of the public because that's all that really matters as all Rocky (or Sly) has eyes for is himself in a rather embarrassing and hokey finale.",Rocky Balboa
235,JWJanneck,"Better than expected, not that that's saying much.",5,27 December 2006,"It's not like the world was waiting for another Rocky sequel. I certainly wasn't. The original Rocky from 1976 was yet another treatment of the underdog theme, one that didn't exactly call for a sequel, but it was commercially successful, and consequently it bred sequels like few others before it. By Rocky V the whole franchise had clearly run out of steam, and Rocky, the Italian Stallion, retired.So now he's back. Obviously older, but in good enough physical shape to allow us to suspend the considerable disbelief that might be generated by the premise---viz. that the old battle horse Rocky Balboa, meanwhile owner of a restaurant and father of a kid who is (a) blaming his father for everything that happens to him and (b) is willing to throw away his career based on nothing but a three-minute sermon from his ex-box-champion dad, that this Rocky comes back to fight the reigning, undefeated heavyweight champion.Thankfully, fairly little time is spent on the actual boxing stuff. Once it's clear that Rocky is going to do it, we get a short sequence showing how he gets his old body back in shape, starting with Duke giving a hilarious speech to Rocky, among other things about his calcium deposits (Paulie gives a knowing nod, obviously having to fight with those deposits himself). And then it's of course right off to the climactic fight sequence, which ends in, at that point, the only possible way.So most of the movie is not about boxing at all, it's about the aging Rocky and how he deals with his place in life and his relations to the people around him, as well as his losses. It's Hollywood, so inevitably it's somewhat corny and definitely predictable, and of course it has a ¨message¨.But it's reasonably well done, the acting works (heck, even Sly gets to act a little this time around!), and the characters are for the most part interesting and likable. I'd make an exception here for the son, Rocky Jr.: His part is badly scripted, and inanely acted. It's difficult to say whether Ventimiglia really just doesn't know how to do it, or whether he simply lost interest in this cardboard cutout character---the result, at least, isn't pretty. The Marie character is interesting (I am sure they were happy that they decided to cut the bit about her becoming a whore out of Rocky V), and so is her son, Steps, but not much is done with the latter.I suppose usually there are better things to do with ones time than to watch this movie---watch some other movie, for example, play with the dog, or watch the rain outside the window. But if you found yourself in a situation where this isn't the case, you'd probably not be too annoyed by this flick. It's alright for what it is, which is Rocky VI, a movie about an aging ex-box-champion coming back to be the prototypical underdog one last time.Or so we think, at this point in time...",Rocky Balboa

Had I not seen this movie about ten years ago when it was the last rocky picture I would have possibly enjoyed this film. Aside from the initial problems with the premise, a sixty year old man boxing the twenty two year old heavyweight champ, the rest of the film is cheesy, lame and pointless. Am I the only one that remembers him having serious brain damage in the previous Rocky? How the heck can he box now after the damage would certainly be worse as he aged. He would be a virtual vegetable. The relationship he has with his son seems unreasonable and aside from that, his son is not a person I would even care to know. Rocky was the heavyweight champ and now he lives in what looks like a dilapidated shack, yet he has enough money to own an upscale Italian restaurant. Like the previous Rocky, he takes in a surrogate son because he has problems relating to his own son, yet after one conversation with his son the boy is suddenly in his corner and forgotten about living in shadow, he simply resigns to it.

4/5Rocky has been retired for years now and runs his own Italian restaurant. He sees a computer simulation on the TV pitting him against the current champion and decides he wants to go for one more fight. It's a little bit preachy at times and has a few too many speeches but it's a nice film which brings the series back to its roots. Sylvester Stallone gives a very committed performance and it's his best in years. He was certainly robbed of the Oscar that year. The whole film was snubbed of any recognition from the awards. It didn't even get a Golden Globe nomination. Stallone also does a wonderful job with the screenplay and shows he still has potential as a director. Burt Young is emotional and funny as his longtime friend/brother in law Paulie stealing every scene he's in. There is a lot more effort put into this film and it really shows on screen. It's in every sense the perfect Rocky sequel. The training montage is a crowd pleaser and so is the final fight. The music score by Bill Conti is incredible (as always) and it's just well acted from everyone. It does cram in a lot of themes like age, regret, family, loss and friendship but it succeeds with a knockout.",Rocky Balboa

The story for the movie was perfect, could a down and out retired boxer known as Rocky go against the heavyweight champion of the world, as boxing has changed a lot since he had boxed. He finds him self up to the challenge. This challenge is excellent to prove that he can go once more. The talk between him and his son is unbelievable. The music is fantastic. Sylvester Stallone plays his part perfect just like he did back in 76'. Everyone in my theater was clapping yelling for Rocky to win I could barely hear the music. This movie is definitely up with his best, Rambo,Rocky.All the side actors played perfect such as Paulie(Burt Young) or Antonio Tarver real retired boxer who played Mason Dixon with all the pride of a champion. This movie still had all the great punchlines that the others had and so much more. If your up for a feel good boxing story or are a real big Rocky fan or even just want to see a good movie.

239,Strider_1978,"It's a slow burner, but an inspiring and meaningfully one.",7,13 January 2007,"It's a good Rocky. It is certainly a step up from Rocky 5, though inmo not as good as Rocky 4. This film is different from the other films in that it is an ageing, or aged Rocky, whichever you prefer, living out his ""retirement"" in a comfortable restaurant with friends and people he knew in the past. From the outset it has a very nostalgic feel. Though not directly in the past, there are reflections of the past by ""going back"" to the streets, as the camera shows various parts of neighbourhoods and structures. We see Rocky as the quiet, and very kind, warm hearted peoples champion. A man loved and respected by many, but living out the remainder of his time quietly. Then of course things happen and he winds up training about for perhaps the last fight of his life. This is not so much an entertainment flick, but more of a slow burner that if you are prepared to follow, is filled with warmth and inspiration. The script is not perfect, but adequate, and Stallone puts in a performance that shows us that Rocky really is ""his"" baby. That said, there are some truly inspiring lines and scenes that can bring a tear to the eye, and without the eye of the tiger or no easy way out. For me the last ten minutes of the ""main event"" crowned the film. When you hear the people, including his female companion but not love interest shouting ""ROCKY, ROCKY"" as the true champion of the people (who is by no means bombastic) gives his bell ringing finale. I would recommend this film to anyone who is down: or insecure about their future, because it brings you up from your knees with a positive and inspirational message that whoever you are, whatever you do, if you want it, and you pay your dues, go out and get it. Because ""there ain't nobody who has the right to take it away"". This film is a winner for those of us that appreciate such things. And what makes me smile, it does this without any special effect whatsoever ;)",Rocky Balboa
240,bastiaan0740,A decent movie,7,1 January 2007,"As Rocky's final installment (probably), this film certainly doesn't disappoint. It tries to capture a lot of the spirit of the first Rocky, which, I feel, is the best way this movie could have been done. The first 4 movies were around themes like ambition, honor and revenge, but the theme of the fifth one (betrayal) always left a hole that needed filling, and this movie gives a much better closure. This film takes itself honestly and lightly, much like Balboa does, just like in the first movie - a down to earth guy. I couldn't help feeling sympathy with Rocky's aging character, which we got to know and understand so well from the previous Rocky's. The incorporation of other old friends are definitely a bonus, a bit in contrast with the new champion, Mason Dixon, who doesn't quite live up to the standard of opponents we have come to expect. Rocky's physique is just right, not too overpowered so we can identify with him, and not too weak to make his challenge unbelievable. Also, his underdog position, like in the first Rocky, is justified because of his age. The fight coverage is done in TV-style, just like normal fights, adding some realism. Also the flashbacks and black-and-white footage were just right. The story sometimes drags and there is less buildup to the fight, but in all, given the material to work with - an aging Stallone - this movie hits its mark perfectly.",Rocky Balboa
241,martijn-56,The very best of this series,10,14 August 2007,"This movie embodies almost the same idea as what Stallone does in producing this 6th and last of the series; being the underdog. I have to say I hardly couldn't see any point in making a 6th one, and that Stallone, then 60, was just mad even thinking about making this movie. All I can say now is, whatever snobs might say about Hollywood mainstream or whatever critics call this, is the same line in the 10th round in the movie; ""what he does is incredible"". I mean, who of us could ever dream of looking physically that fit at age 60? He did it, incredible. And how could you make a meaningful end to this series at all? Stallone managed this and with this feat he can forever put aside criticism about being a shallow action star that doesn't accept he is getting older. Stallone managed to put depth and feeling in this movie, without loosing the action and usual thrill of any rocky part. It is full of good and memorable lines, especially to his son, about how to get out of your life what you want, without the usual American dream crap. What I also really appreciated was the self-humor and self-irony, especially about getting older. The pace in this film was well done too; depth and dialog all the time, skipping the heroic training stuff and going straight to business with the fight. The opponent was also well chosen; an athletic and simply good fighter, no superhuman bad guy. The result was a sportive and as realistic as possible fight and story about a crazy ex champ just wanting to do what he wants to do. This film had no pretensions. Together with the satisfying end, how could this last part have been done better? It simply blends the best of all the previous Rocky movies; action and feeling. So, does it make the best in the series? Rocky 1 was just a wonderful movie who had both a heart and the action, the second to the fifth shifted a bit too much to the glory and the action but they gave us the wonderful and some of the best action available in movies at the time. The fifth ranks among the Time Magazine 1999 poll's 100 worst ideas, but this fantastic comeback is there. To come back with a meaningful end like this Rocky VI I rank it among the best, and give it a 10 since I thought it could never touch any of the previous four. This one maybe not a total knockout however, but definitely a two thumbs up. Great Stallone, to have you around in the film-industry, and please make Rambo too in the same vein!",Rocky Balboa
242,galahad58,An Oscar quality movie,10,25 December 2006,"It has been a long time since I had written one of my reviews, but I felt like I had to write something about Rocky. I have not seen a movie of Rocky's quality since Million Dollar Baby. Rocky is one of the finest movies made in the last couple of years. Stallone returned to the writing style from his first Rocky script. He creates wonderful characters, wonderful conversation and situations, and an extremely heartfelt movie. No movie moved me, emotionally, as much as the Rocky movie moved me this weekend. Though I identified with many of the aspects the character was experiencing, I felt that it was a very emotional and beautifully crafted film. Rocky is dealing with the loss of his wife Adrianne. Those who have followed the series know how much Adrianne meant to Rocky and the movie shows how hard Rocky finds life without his beloved wife. The movie goes through the pains of loss and loneliness that many of us have felt throughout the years. The movie also deals with an ex-athlete who really is living on memories. Memories of his wife and memories of his past endeavors. As a person who played many many sports, I love to remember those things and always feel the desire to prove that I can still do some of those things today. The boxing is a back-drop though to the emotional situations and the human aspect of the Rocky character. Stallone shows the loneliness of Rocky and how he needs a friend to rely on. How Rocky has an estranged son who barely talks to him, how he deals with an angry and miserable Paulie and how he spends his evenings telling old boxing stories to the customers of his restaurant. The story shows how Rocky meets ""Little Marie"" from Rocky I again and how he needs her friendship and needs to reestablish the social aspect of his life. Rocky is about people. Rocky is extremely well written and deserves an Oscar nomination for screenplay. I felt that it was well directed. I also felt that Stallone was in his best form, as an actor, since Rocky I and also deserves an Oscar nomination.",Rocky Balboa

I just want to say thank gosh he was given the chance to make this movie.. I'm not saying it's by all time the best movie ever made.. But to create this movie, going back to the original feel for the first Rocky, was amazing.. It was just such a great feeling to end his movies this way instead of leaving it at Rocky 5.. Heck, i might even like Rocky 5 a little more now that i know it's not the end... Don't go into the movie thinking ""all out war, boxing boxing boxing."" It wasn't about that... It was so much more... I am, again, just glad that the studios gave the green light on this project!",Rocky Balboa
245,neobateman,Awesome comeback story,8,20 November 2016,"Rocky Balboa was released in 2006. It once again is directed by Sylvester Stallone. He felt obligated to make this movie after Rocky V, and I see the passion that Stallone had every time I watch. Rocky is retired and still lives in Philadelphia, his life feels unfulfilled. He is offered a chance to return into the ring and fight the best boxer of that time. This movie unlike Rocky III and Rocky IV goes back to what made the first Rocky film so great. The underdog Rocky himself, this is a drama set in the life of Rocky and the boxing is just one side event inside Rocky's life. It is centered around the characters and not on big monsters drenched in baby oil. This truly is an awesome film on determination and second chances, if you haven't seen Rocky Balboa do so. In my opinion it is the best film in the series after Rocky and Creed.",Rocky Balboa
246,bobm5508,Stallone has written and performed a minor miracle here!!,9,21 December 2006,"This new ROCKY is a truly fitting finale to the saga of Rocky Balboa. Always likable, usually stirring and entertaining (of course, I'm not acknowledging there was a Rocky V), this version has replaced macho with heart. In a glorious, pitch perfect performance of a revered Champ in the twilight of a now lonely, unfulfilled life, Stallone is actually amazing. I didn't think he still had this kind of heartfelt performance in him. He has written, directed and performed this work with the insight of a person who has endured all the ups and downs that a career can experience.The setting is familiar, the characters have been thinned down to only the dependably irritating Paulie, the haunting memory of his beloved Adrian, his withdrawn and overshadowed son and a struggling acquaintance from his past. All the performances are fine, but this is about Stallone in full on Rocky mode. He exudes the melancholy of a life that has lost meaning, while not unpleasant, just not connected. His revelation that he wants to ""like fight"" doesn't seem weird or unnatural.Some of the film's conventions to get him back in the ring, with the current undefeated champ no less, are achieved quickly and stretch our believability, but once that ""Rocky Theme"" (and as I sit here, I'm getting a goose bump or two) blares out of the sound system, you are getting ""READY TO RUMBLE!!!!"" The fight sequences, which have always been cartoonishly brutal, mock the limits of human endurance and insanely exciting, deliver once again. But its the insight that Stallone brings to this script, his heartfelt ""speeches"" to the Licensing board, his son and of course, Paulie, that are the real knockouts in the film.I am so glad this turned out to be the fitting farewell that an icon like Rocky and Sylvester both deserve.",Rocky Balboa
247,pitsburghfuzz,Satisfying Conclusion,7,12 January 2010,"After Rocky V, I don't think many thought that 16 years later a sequel would be made. The first three were alright, then IV was where the series started to screw itself over. Then, there was V, which back when it came out was a terrible movie. Then, after a long struggle, Stallone shockingly enough was able to make a satisfying ending to this film franchise. This film and the first in my opinion, is the best in the series and I like the name of the title the best: Rocky Balboa. After a simulated computer fight, 33-0 Mason Dixon wanted to prove he could take down the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa. Rocky wants ti fight, but has struggles along the way to get permission to fight Dixon, due to his age. This is Stallone's best performance in the series, and it takes me back personally to what made the first not bad(however, the advantage the first one and the others had was the brilliant performance of Burgess Meredith which kept me watching the series.) The ending is a great ending and is very uplifting. Even if you hate Rocky, this one you may make an exception on.",Rocky Balboa
248,Serge_Zehnder,Simple but true,7,3 December 2008,"This is no masterpiece, no Rocky movie ever was one, but nevertheless, ""Rocky Balboa"" is a sweet and endearing send off to one of cinemas most beloved underdog-icons.Mr. Stallone takes the Italian Stallion out of the paddock and into he ring for a few memories, pieces of wisdom and punches. As uncertain as I was when I heard about this movie being made, as touched was I when the credits rolled and I remembered that this installment like the first Rocky worked beautifully on our dreams and imaginings to reach something unattainable.It's a morality play disguised in a pulpy romance/fighter story. And maybe because of its simplicity will never lose it's punch. Sometimes that's all that is needed, but it can get you a long way.",Rocky Balboa
249,konover,Surprise and relief! Rocky Balboa is a winner,10,14 December 2006,"Guys...Stallone did it.I went in cringing and walked out impressed.The tone was closer to the first two Rocky movies, but it did it in a way that the fifth movie wasn't able to grasp. One key ingredient: verisimilitude.They treated the boxing in the film the way boxing is in real life. I know, because I covered and followed the sport very closely for about three years.Real life boxing personalities pepper the film's cast. For the fight scene, they got the current HBO announcing team of Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman.They treated the build-up to the fight not unlike movie audiences are treating Rocky Balboa the movie: What, another Rocky movie/fight? There is some reminiscing of the past like in Rocky 5, but it's handled much better. It flows naturally from Rocky the character. It's not nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia the way some of Rocky V played out. In fact, I got choked up quite a few times throughout the film.The writing is excellent. The monologue from the first Rocky teaser, that some people criticized, shows up in this movie. It plays WAAAAAAAAAAAY better, more powerfully, with more emotional resonance in the context of the movie. The teaser didn't do it justice. The movie does.If you're a Rocky fan, you have to see it. If your girlfriend/boyfriend aren't Rocky fans or have never seen a Rocky movie, you have to take them.My 19-year-old girlfriend thinks she has seen Rocky but only as a little girl, so she had a vague, if any, recollection of the series. So vague, in fact, that she even told me that Stallone the actor looked ""familiar"". And she loved the movie. She cheered, and when the fight started, she told me, ""I'm so nervous!"" In the end, she also loved the character of Rocky, proving to me that the character's appeal--despite his age and several decades removed from his debut---is still undeniable.Stallone was great in the role, of course. This is obviously the part he was born to play.Burt Young is great as Paulie. He gave a nice supporting performance with the right touch of humor.I was impressed with Antonio Tarver as Mason Dixon. Tarver, as some of you might know, is a real fighter. In fact, I saw him fight once in Miami. He turned in a good performance, which I wasn't expecting since he's an athlete, not an actor. So Tarver deserves a nod.The movie is inspiring---the winning quality in all Rocky movies.Now don't get me wrong: I'm not claiming this is Rocky I all over again. This is the sixth movie in what was a tired series when we last saw it, but Stallone breathed new life into it and it's definitely a deserving addition to the Rocky series.Lastly, there's a moment in the theater that I really, really want to share with you guys. Don't worry, it has nothing to do with the end.The movie audience was pretty quiet throughout the first half. But when Rocky starts training to the Rocky theme, the crowd came alive and began cheering and clapping. I saw one guy throwing punches during the fight. Another guy was stomping on the ground from what I imagined was excitement of the fight, and nervousness.I'm not sure Stallone could've made a better part 6 than this.",Rocky Balboa
250,Hint523,Who would've thought,8,30 July 2007,"I was never a big Rocky fan, even though I love boxing movies. I never bothered to see Rocky 2-5, because I always heard about how bad they were. But, after seeing tons of commercials for Rocky Balboa, this one intrigued me. The first Rocky I didn't like because lets face it, we all knew he was going to win. With this one, Rocky is the underdog. He's an old man, and he knows it.Rocky feels a lot like the original in the sense that Avildsen summed up best: it is not a boxing movie, it is a romance movie. In Rocky we don't see him train or fight for very long: most of it is about his relationship with Adrian. In Rocky Balboa, it's similar, but there is a lot more fighting and training, but the rest is about his friends and family. I liked this one better than Rocky for the simple reason that it gets you going more. The first one it's obvious he's going to win, but this one, you don't know. You feel like he is a true underdog, and the fight scenes are longer and more intense. It's a good film.",Rocky Balboa
251,j_graves68,Yo Rocky...No mas! No mas !,5,2 January 2007,"This was a nice ending to an over-tired franchise that lost its prime way back in the mid eighties. It was typical Rocky-sh*t: from the melodramatic score of Bill Conti laced within the same plot layout from the first two films; lots of melodramatic exposition leading up to a pretty routine match at the climax with the same bellicose boxing score each time; and slo-mo graphic boxing violence that leaves one scratching their head wondering how the MPAA overlooked this movie and slapped a ""PG"" rating on it instead of a ""PG-13.""What made this film keep some appeal (being that it basked in nostalgia for so many scenes from the other movies) was its juxtaposition with past and current events. It also acknowledged its own flaws (reminiscing the past, a fiftysomething fighting after a twenty-year absence, even the sports commentators were as cynical as the public was to the mere thought of a film like this). Mason Dixon's character was overall pretty two-dimensional as was Dolph Lundgren's (from ""Rocky IV'); as was Mr. T's. (from ""Rocky III"")- but those were traditions within the ""Rocky"" legacy (or franchise). Apollo Creed was probably two-and-a-half dimensions just like Rocky's character was.""It Ain't Over til It's Over"" was probably Stallone's mantra he recited to himself every day when this film was in production. He probably pitched that to every doubting studio exec when he asked for financing for the film. And when he needed a tagline for the movie poster, he probably thought, ""hey, why not that?"" He also knew the futility of this project (which was cleverly insinuated in euphemisms throughout the picture), but he still had some fun with it. An example was when he said that exact line to his boxing adversary, and Dixon asks, ""what- is that from the eighties or something?"" He replies with uncertainty saying: ""Uh no, from the seventies I think."" I think the fact that Stallone had not lost his sense of humor saved this film from being unbearable to watch.As other posters cited that Stallone went out in dignity. True. He did. But when I exhale and think that that will forever be the last of the ""Rocky"" saga, a little sound-byte and video image goes off in my head when Stallone was on Arsenio Hall in the early nineties. Arsenio asked him after the defeat of ""Rocky V,"" ""Are there going to be any more 'Rocky's?"" Stallone replied a quick, ""No."" I guess he was really saying, ""Yo.""",Rocky Balboa
252,dennis_chiu1,Astonishing,9,29 December 2006,"With John G. Avildsen (Academy Award winning director of the original Academy Award winning Best Picture ""Rocky"" ) gone from the credit, I wondered how Sylvester Stallone would fair as Executive Producer, Director, Writer and Actor of what is purported to be the last Rocky film. My curiosity paid off, because Mr. Stallone turns in a very fine film in which he should be proud and I was surprised to enjoy thoroughly. I rate Mr. Stallone's effort a 9 out of 10 only because the general skeleton plot followed the underdog fight formula. However, Mr. Stallone's choices in how to build flesh onto the film's formula skeleton are exceptional. From the beginning of the film, Mr. Stallone makes the right choice, and continues with more right choices. Instead of portraying Rocky as a still able stallion, he portrays Rocky as a horse put out to pasture. Instead of requiring Rocky to have a new love interest, Mr. Stallone writes Rocky to be grieving from the untimely death of his greatest love, Adrian (portrayed by Talia Shire in flashbacks). Mr. Stallone also brings the film properly back to location shooting in and around Philadelphia, where every corner has a memory and Rocky's ghosts fade in and out. Anyone who has ever lost someone they loved and visited old haunts once shared together, but now may only be remembered alone, will understand how properly the experience is portrayed in film. After 30 minutes have elapsed, excellently portrayed familiar characters, witty lines, ghostly flashbacks, and deftly handled nostalgia simply drew me into the heart of the film. Many little touches and attention to detail are required to make a good film memorable. There are scenes where Rocky, a restaurant owner of ""Adrian's"", must go table to table telling the same old fight stories. There are scenes where Rocky is asked for autographs and takes the same picture with his fist hanging just inches beneath a fan's chin. In the last parts of the film, there are a montage training sequences and a fight at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino which is smartly shot as if everyone in the theater bought HBO Pay-Per-View. These are well edited and not overly bloody. Bill Conti lends a steady hand to Mr. Stallone's film writing nostalgic piano derivatives of his famous original score. However, the nostalgic derivatives are just teasers until the entire orchestra is let loose by Mr. Conti to play the original score in the montage training sequence. Watching the film closely, I found Mr. Stallone's cinematography choices, direction and acting well done. Overall, I highly recommend this film to your attention.",Rocky Balboa
253,cobbler88,A nice way to go,7,8 January 2007,"I thought that, while the whole thread of Rocky trying to move on and leave Adrian in the past was slightly on the tedious side, the formula pretty much worked. I found it refreshing that the Mason Dixon character wasn't cast as the archetypal mean, soulless opponent who must be crushed at all costs. Tossing Tyson in there felt completely tacked on, but Tarver's Dixon sort of mirrored Balboa's character in Rocky III, going back to his roots to recapture what made him a success in the first place. Overall, I think this movie wrapped things up nicely. Of course, there never really ARE many concurrent story lines in a Rocky movie to wrap up. Simple stories about a simple guy, and by the end of the film, you really only hope Rocky has one last great effort in him.",Rocky Balboa
254,lerkim,One send off that does what it deserved!!!,10,20 May 2009,"I used to see these movies as a child, I didn't get all of it back then but it was like going down memory lane, many movies that are sequels this late from the early suck but this didn't, of course 2006 has been a year of change, we got Rocky Balboa, Rambo 4, Die Hard 4, and later we even got Indiana Jones, all these were sequels that won, but this isn't about them this is about Rocky.What I like about this one is that is goes down and does what the first movie did, it isn't as good but it does the same, second I was happy to actually see that Marie who isn't really much in the first movie is the one who actually changes the fact in the last, which many might think is wrong but I believe it was just what was needed.Second all those special moments when Rocky talks, special things are said all the way, and of course I was also very thrilled to see Paulie again the only one except Duke who has been in every movie with the exception of Rocky of course.And third but not least, there were flashbacks in Rocky V but they didn't do as well as they do in this one, the end is terminate by one person in my head, one voice, even if only for a flashback that was the perfect way to end a really cool legacy, Rocky got what he deserved.Now we only need to see if Rambo, John Maclane and Indiana Jones gets the perfect ending as well because we all know that new movies for those are coming it has already been decided soo looking forward..!!!",Rocky Balboa

However, in one of the nicest surprises in recent film history, 'Rocky Balboa' is a very enjoyable film - it's slight, predictable and sentimental yet somehow it just works. There is a real sense of art imitating life, or vice versa, with a written-off star proving the critics wrong and Stallone gives a great performance as the indomitable old boxer, coming back to prove himself one last time.",Rocky Balboa
256,MovieRat-2,One final tear jerking hurrah,9,22 December 2006,"The final film in the Rocky series returns to its roots of the first two films as a serious drama of searching for one's identity amidst the backdrop of boxing. Stallone proves that a 60 year old Rocky can still be rock hard and able to dish out the pain while at the same time struggling with his own personal demons of Adrian's death, his son's distant behavior, and mid-life crisis of ""who am I?"". Antonio Tarver (real life boxer) as Mason Dixon also gives a good performance as a troubled boxer with a (as I call it) ""Mike Tyson syndrome"" where he's so good he can beat anyone in one round and is causing him to start doubting his own worth. I can go one but this film is more than about Rocky trying to get back what he lost, its about every character in the story searching for answers in their lives at pivotal down moments in their existence. Excellent all round and is one of the best of the Rocky films. A must see, should be nominated for an award or two.",Rocky Balboa

But when a virtual reality fight is constructed against the Undefeated Heavyweight Champ - Mason Dixon, and Rocky wins - This gets everybody wondering. Dixons promoters get the fight set up, and BANG, we're all set up for the exhilarating fight in Las Vegas.

259,Kevin_Maness,"legitimately could have been great, but it settled for ""not horrible""",4,4 January 2007,"(I think I've written this review without ""spoilers,"" but, really, how could any review spoil the end of a Rocky movie?) I went to see Rocky Balboa with a friend last night, mostly because he had given me the special edition of the first Rocky movie on DVD, and it came with a free ticket to see Rocky Balboa. Over the past few days, I'd been surprised to see quite a number of positive reviews of the new (and hopefully last) Rocky movie (from now on, I'll call it ""RB""). So I went into the movie with a pretty open mind, although I couldn't stop thinking that people probably liked it because they went into it with such abysmally low expectations. If you're expecting ""horrendous"" and you just get ""fairly bad,"" you might end up thinking that the movie was a reasonable success, right? As it turns out, I think that's what happened for me, too. I didn't hate the movie, and I certainly got my money's worth (it was free after all). But I wouldn't go so far as to say that the movie was good. In fact, I gave it a 4 out of 10 on IMDb, and here's why...Stallone and his collaborators basically had a choice to make: this could either be a good movie, able to stand on its own as a cinematic work (not unlike the first Rocky), OR they could make a movie that would pay its respects to the whole Rocky franchise and basically put the old horse (or stallion) to rest. Stallone et al. chose the latter. And I can see how it would have been difficult to make any other choice--this movie definitely seems to be designed to provide Rocky with a fitting send off, and most viewers seem to appreciate it as such. My complaint is that the movie could have been something better if it didn't need to be an homage to the rest of the series.In my viewing experience, I VERY quickly grew impatient for the final fight. As the supposed human interest subplots flickered in and out like dying florescent light rods, and as the actors kept delivering clichéd nuggets of pseudo-populist street philosophy (all of which seemed designed to stud the pages of some kind of 365 motivational thoughts for the stereotypical guy from South Philly), I lost interest in everything but the boxing match at the end. The only question that remained for me was whether Rocky would win the big fight and teach Mason Dixon (seriously, Mason Dixon???--who comes up with this stuff?) a lesson about heart, or would he lose the big fight and teach Mason Dixon a lesson about heart? And the fight at the end did its work: as I left the theater, I felt for several minutes as if RB had been pretty good, all in all. But that was only because the fight sequence was exciting and overstimulating (and dialogue-free) enough to make me forget what had gone before it.In short, RB has the unfortunate task of needing to resolve too many story lines in the hour before the final fight--it has to deal with Rocky's inner demons (which are left oddly undefined--alternately referred to as ""the stuff in the basement"" or the ""beast"" within), his memories of Adrian, his alienation from his son, and Pauley's failed life (really, has Pauley had anything constructive to offer in any of these movies?), all legacies from the previous Rocky movies. And, to make matters even more impossible, the movie takes on the added burden of creating, developing, and resolving several new plot lines: Rocky's efforts to be a positive force in the lives of Little Marie and her son, Steps; the potential for a romantic relationship with Little Marie; and the character and career of Mason Dixon. There's too much here to work with when everyone knows that the climactic fight is really why we're here.If Stallone had chosen to make this a real movie, rather than a bookend, he could have done this many ways. I think one interesting approach would have been to focus on Rocky, his son, and the young champ, Mason Dixon. All three of these characters are fighting with opponents that come from within, and even though Rocky has learned this lesson before, he continues to struggle with it--even so, he has some wonderful insights to pass on to his boy and to his opponent, Dixon. We don't really need Pauley, Marie, Steps, or any of the other distractions--we don't even really need the memories of Adrian, although they could probably still be worked in. This approach would necessitate finding some skilled, capable actors to play the young Balboa and Dixon, and it would require time spent developing these characters into complex, round, dynamic characters. But that extra character development would have the potential to come together explosively and dramatically in the final fight sequence--we'd care much more about the fight if Dixon mattered as a human being (rather than just a generalized stereotype of a young, black, hip-hop athlete), and if Rock's son in the corner meant something real to us as the audience....anyway, it's just an idea.If you're a Rocky fan, you virtually must see this movie. And if you just kinda like the Rocky series, you'll probably still enjoy the movie. But I can't help regretting that this movie could have been something great (which is more than I can say for 2, 3, 4,...), but it settled for being something not horrible.",Rocky Balboa
260,Weredegu,"Could have been kitchy, turned out to be catchy",10,25 March 2007,"Excellent finish to the series of not always clever movies about constant underdog Rocky Balboa. This last one is a very elegant punch. And clearly above the waistline, so to say: it could have easily been kitchy, instead it turned out to be quite catchy. If you're low on confidence you'll eat up this movie like a triple hamburger. It's so humane, shows so much respect and does so so much without any regard to whatever stereotypical judgment might tell you not to believe in a given person, it's like an intravenous injection of positive mindset, whatever that exactly constitutes. I don't know if Silvester Stallone would fit some other role as well as this one (I didn't appreciate him that much as Rambo in 'First Blood'), but even if this is and has been the only role that he was really cut out for, he already did it as an actor.I loved the characters in the story, flesh and bones and real they felt, especially in the run-down district milieu to the sight of which we're not treated that often in other Hollywood movies. Those littered Philadelphia streets are like the veins and arteries of the movie, pulsating with the reality feeding the simple but great story.",Rocky Balboa
261,dan_c99,A great film - proves that Stallone can really act,10,20 January 2010,"A lot of people seem not to like this film, but I liked it, primarily for nostalgic reasons. And, of course, the screenplay is heavily into remembrance of the past stories, touched with the circumstances and needs of Rocky's current life. He obviously grieves for Adrian, and that colors much of Rocky's outlook, but there are other demons that must be confronted and excised. And, for those who have been there themselves, this is familiar and real. For these reasons, Rocky the Fighter becomes Rocky the Everyman. And the two become synonymous.Stallone is his usual dominating presence, but his supporting cast deserves kudos, from old rival, later friend and trainer 'Duke', to seemingly minor characters like 'Spider Rico' and 'Marie'. Burt Young as brother-in-law Paulie presents a slightly more mellow and softer side than his earlier turns, which were more of the brutish and thuggish ""loser"". Rival boxer 'Mason Dixon' and his handlers are even offered in a somewhat sympathetic and appealing manner.In the end, Rocky is able to lose the beast within and find a measure of personal redemption, inner peace, and closure, and that is a fitting and satisfying way to end the Rocky saga. He does it his way, in the ring, engaged in the sport he loves that has shaped his life, but also in the quiet of his grieving and memories at Adrian's grave. We know that Rocky will endure and fight on, if not in the ring then in life, because it is what he does. And that is a fitting message to leave us with, because it is what we all do.",Rocky Balboa

Is the soul of Rocky kept in the movie ?YES YES YESRocky Balboa is a beautiful movie and most of all Sly has captured the the soul of the first Rocky movie and put it into Rocky 6. As we all know Sly is a good actor and keeps the Rocky character well balanced and takes us through the first Rocky era with Emotions and breath taking action/training.The only thing that is missing in the movie is the Theme song from Eye of the Tiger, Hey Rocky how can you forget that :)Rocky is a legend and will always be a legend and we all know it.One final thing Go Watch the Movie...its worth every single second.",Rocky Balboa
263,AshokePrabha,"""The fire at the bottom"" didn't burn enough?",6,7 June 2008,"I watched the first Rocky about 20 years ago when I was a school going kid. Despite the foreign language distance still I felt very strong about the movie. The main reason is the first Rocky has a poetic story line and was well acted. At the end of Rocky 1, Rocky becomes a star. Then in the sequels those followed, the Rocky 'star' shines up and up with roaring actions sans a fewer emotional highlights of the man 'Rocky Balboa' in his life. I thought Rocky 5 would have been a best movie bringing back the man in Rocky but it was not. It was just about inheritance. Between the real one and the professional one. It just stopped with that.When I heard about this Rocky 6 I did not believe it is coming. Because if a movie comes out of Rocky anymore it should have the 'fall' of Rocky as an aged, old, deserted person, which nobody wants to buy it (would be too classy!!). But 'Rocky' character has evolved so much that making money out of it still become a possibility. Honesty and sincerity is not there in the scripts. That echoes in the punches of this Rocky going weightless. If it was really about the 'fire at the bottom of your stomach' then it would have become a classic. Rocky himself did not care much about that fire in acting..and others?(Paulie still holds good but he alone could not stop the damage). Then is it a very bad movie? Not quiet. If you like Stallone and boxing still you could enjoy it. There are some moments about the haunting loneliness at old age. And of course the climax boxing match is there..'Line Nixon' was portrayed differently; not a typical villain. But not enough depth. Should there be an another sequel? may be. Because Rocky 6 did not finish well. The story of a boxer is not a 'winning story'. It is full of pains and struggles to see the 'glimpse' of glory and money. Rocky 1 was a melodrama. The ending sequel of Rocky must be a melodrama. By this at least the 'Rocky' character could be saved. If this 'Rocky Balboa' is going to be your first movie in 'Rocky' series then I suggest to not watch this. Watch it all from the first 'Rocky'. Then you'll get a flow. Anybody seen 'unforgiven'? about an old timer cowboy(Clint Eastwood) flaring back for real at old age. That is a classic and this one is not. That's all the difference.",Rocky Balboa

265,FMACDONALD,What a shock...It's awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,2 January 2007,"Anybody that says Rocky Balboa sounded good is a liar. Like everybody else I heard Sylvester Stalone was making a Rocky VI, I thought that to myself, ""My word, is he such a has-been""? Then I saw a preview, and I remember thinking ""Wow, that doesn't look that bad"". So I went to my local multiplex with two of my buddies and threw down my heard earned cash, and saw Rocky Balboa, and I can honestly say that it was awesome! This was the best in the series since the original, and I left the theater with an ear to ear grin on my face. This is the perfect way to end the series, and Stalone had the right idea. He, along with the rest of the fans did not like Rocky V, so he erased that film from the series and didn't even mention it. In several flash back scenes in the film all the previous films are mentioned except the fifth, and that was a good thing.Years have passed since Rocky IV, and Rocky (Stalone) is no retired, and in his late 50's. He is retired, and now owns a restaurant called Adrian's, named after the love of his life, his wife Adrian, who we learn has passed away. Inside the restaurant there are pictures of Adrian (Talia Shire) all over the place, as well as championship belts and magazines with Rocky on the cover. Rocky himself goes from table to table telling stories of past fights to customers as well as posing for pictures with them. Rocky seems to enjoy the retired life but misses Adrian, and is having a tough time going on without her. He is also having trouble connecting with his son Robert, who is semi-ashamed of his father.We then meet the current Heavyweight Champion of the world Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (yes that's his name) who, like Lennox Lewis in real life, has beaten every major contender for the world title and now just fights jobbers. He doesn't get the respect he deserves and fans pelt him with ice cubes and food after every fight, because they now view him as a closet champion who has been spoon fed his opponents.When ESPN holds a computer generated fight between Balboa and Dixon, and Balboa beats him public interest fuels and it doesn't take Rocky long to pull a George Forman and get back into the ring to fight the much younger Dixon.What makes Rocky Balboa work is the heart felt story. You feel bad for Rocky who's fighting the biggest fight of life, not with Dixon, with loneliness. He can't take the fact that the one thing that mattered most to him in this world Adrian, is gone. All he has left is a son who doesn't appreciate him, and his loud mouth brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young, who hasn't missed a beat in the role).The other second element that makes this film good is Dixon. unlike the ever cocky Apollo Creed, or the over the top antics of Clubber Lang, or the ""Ultimate Fighting Machine"" Ivan Drago, Mason Dixon is just a fighter who is struggling, like Rocky, not with loneliness but with getting the respect as a good fighter from boxing fans.the best element of the Rocky Balboa though is the fight at the end of the movie. Unlike the over the top, glorified wrestling match in Rocky IV, The fight is very reminiscent of the fights in the fist two. At one point, when I was watching it for the second time with my father, I felt like I was watching a real HBO Boxing Pay-Per-View. I also couldn't help but fight off tears once that familiar music hit at the end of the fight.This is the perfect way to end the series. While the original is still my favorite, This one stands up to the original. The writing is tight as well as the acting. Stalone really went back to his roots on this one. You'll have to see it to know what i'm referring to.If the rumors are true, and this is Sylvester Stalone's final movie as an actor (it's rumored he wants to just produce and direct now) then this was a great way to go out, and an even better way to end the series that made him a star.Rocky Balnoa is one of the best films of 2006 and deserves the praise it's getting. Congatulations Mr. Stalone. You did it, now please let those Rambo 4 rumors be just that...rumors.",Rocky Balboa
266,superduperspit,"Rocky is back baby! You are going to laugh, shout, and stand up and say ROCKY!",8,25 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa is the surprise of the year, it was the underdog and the shut out, but now the champ is back on top. Rocky is one of if not my favorite movie which I just realized a couple of days ago with a re-visit, it's such a champ's story, the underdog story and it just grabs your heart and doesn't let go. Now I am not a fan of the movie's sequels, I disregard 3-5, they range from okay to crap and I just, do not like them. Like everyone else I was very skeptical upon hearing that this was being made, it comes off as the sort of cash grab Hollywood has these days, giving re-birth to old franchises that really don't need sequels. In truth, the Rocky movies never needed more than one movie, but if there had to be a sequel this is the one I accept.To many's surprise, it was getting good reviews, not unlike a pleasant Charlotte's Web is loved by critics with good reviews, no this sequel was actually being called good. The trailers were fine, but it was not until the TV spots when I started to get excited. Was this going to be the surprise of the year, the comeback of the year? Was this movie going to be, dare I say it? Great?!? No one would have thought, but boy is it ever great. I can tell some are still skeptical even with the great reviews and my review, it is because it is just another sequel, but please do not let that stop you. This is a great movie, ignore the crappy ones, this gives re-birth and a very great END to the franchise that obviously should have never been.Stallone said in interviews that he made this because he was so unhappy how Rocky V turned out that he just had to get it out of his system he needed Rocky to end as the underdog, but still a champ. Call it a cash grab, which in a way it is because lets face Stallone isn't getting work like he used to, which when he used to wasn't anything to rave over, but as much as it is just another sequel, it's not just another sequel. He truly has put a lot of heart in the making of this film, he really wanted this to be great and well Sly my friend, you did it.Stallone wrote, directed & starred in Rocky Balboa, a lot to take on for a man of his age. He did it all with ease. The writing to my surprise is really well done; the dialogue in the movie is wonderfully set. Be warned this movie is a lot more of a drama than a sports epic, but NO, DON'T BE AFRAID! Do not let the word drama turn you away. Rocky Balboa does contain a lot of dialogue but it is so well written and said during the movie that you honestly don't miss the action and you're compelled to these characters, the talks between Rocky and someone's grave, who I shall not name if you haven't seen it, the talks between Rocky and his son, Rocky and Paula, Rocky and everyone else, are all very well done, I have to really say.Now there is action, the last 10 minutes is action, PURE action from start to finish, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. The moment you hear the theme, when he starts his training, like everyone in the theatre you will cheer, applaud, cry and stand up and move with Rocky, the blood starts pumping. I swear to you this is the only movie this year that has and probably will remain like this with the exception of Dreamgirls that has given me chills all over my body, when he is in that ring, with the lights glaring, the commentary going, the crowd going wild you are at the edge of your seat cheering the underdog on! Rocky Balboa is not only the surprise movie of the year but one of the best, and I have to say I was so pleasantly put back by how great this movie, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Rocky is back ladies and gents.Bottom Line: Rocky is back baby, you are going to cheer, you are going to laugh, you are to shout and stand up and say, ROCKY!

267,drfraud-1,some actors are not meant to direct,4,4 March 2007,"This was by far one of the worst movies I've seen this year. Rocky looks and acts like a mentally retarded. Acting is awful, characters are really cheesy, camera work is very ammature and the storyline itself has been pretty much done before in comedies and parodies of the Rocky series. But an idea of someone actually trying to make a movie about a geriatric boxer is completely ludicrous. I don't know what sort of a person you have to be to laugh at the jokes in this movie, but I felt pity for whoever wrote them (probably Stalone himself). The storyline is also extremely one sided. We are presented with an angelic Rocky and his ridiculously philanthropic nature and the evil black guy, young punk with hateful, devil looking agents. I guess Stalone really takes the moviegoers for complete idiots with such a ridiculous movie. I personally don't think this movie deserves anything but a 4/10 and this is what it's getting from me.",Rocky Balboa
268,phaneendrakumar,Great End,9,5 February 2007,"Definitely a great ending for a great movie..I always loved the Rocky movie..II through V parts are bit bore and made for the heck of it, but this movie is a real classic. I enjoyed it completely.I expected this movie to be one of those lousy REMAKES, which all the Rocky movies are, but, the acting and writing from Stallone were too good to handle. Especially, the end was very apt for such a long franchise.The father-son discussion at the restaurant was a great one. One of the best speeches filmed after the ""Independance day"" movie..A must watch for all the Rocky fans.",Rocky Balboa
269,forindcine,A wonderful ending to the ROCKY franchise,9,31 December 2006,"Thirty years ago in 1976, America was celebrating its bicentennial, Jimmy Carter was elected president and ROCKY hit the screens starting a franchise in film. The character, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) started a series of ""cheer the underdog"" films. The Rocky-concept was re-created, sometimes better than others, in 1979, 1982, 1985, and in 1990. Today at age 60,Stallone looks his age, arteries bulge from his chest even when he's relaxed. He looks like a tired father or grandpa. The years have taken its toll on this character but he uses all this to his advantage.In this film, Rocky is depressed, his wife, Adrian died 4-years ago, and his son, has little to do with him because he ""casts a big shadow."" But Rocky is still highly respected in ""Philly."" Fans stop him on the streets to take photos with cell phones and everyone still calls him the champ. To keep busy, Balboa runs a small South Philly restaurant named after his wife. Someone develops a computer-generated program matching long-retired Rocky Balboa pound-for-pound with the current, undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champ, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver). Dixon is mostly disliked in boxing circles but his camp feels he should hold an exhibition fight with Balboa for another multi-million dollar, Pay-Per-View payday. You get the standard clichés and motivational speeches, which are all updated and very well done, but you also get many humorous one-liners from Rocky and the solid cast. With grace, skill and maturity, the veteran Stallone does a wonderful job writing, starring and directing this final episode. Anyone ages 40 and above will enjoy this film while being pleasantly surprised with the scorecards at the end of this contest.ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!",Rocky Balboa

I was beginning to wonder if I was losing it, or if movies were just becoming lame. So with a lot of doubt I decided to give Rocky Balboa a shot even though people had already told me how it went. The movie was great! I loved this movie so much. The great thing about this movie was along both of the monologues he had in this movie, he taught many valueable lessons that I take seriously now. The world isn't all sunshines and rainbows. And not everyone wants you to succeed so you need to decide that upon yourself to succeed. This was a great movie all around and the acting was great. I would have loved this movie 20 years ago,(when Stallone was in his prime) or now and I still believe he is a great actor.",Rocky Balboa
271,MaximusXXX,"Good, but not great.",7,20 December 2006,"It was in my opinion not a better action film such as Rocky IV, which the most fast paced and most thrilling Rocky, it was close to the original, but not equal to it. Rocky Balboa adds the finishing touches to the franchise, and it's an enjoyable movie, but only if you are a Rocky fan, this is not a film to be watched alone without first watching the other five.I believe that had Stallone made the film a decade before as he had initially intended, it would have turned out better, for age does have a factor. However Stallone did his best to give us a more than decent finale to a great saga.",Rocky Balboa
272,d-apergis,Thumbs up,7,10 April 2010,"The movie is a definite winner any way you can look at it, even if the storyline needed some doctoring so that the events and situations that lead to the final fight would appear more credible. Still however, as it is, it's a gritty and moving character-driven drama with a deep humanity in it. And this feat can only be attributed to Stallone who wrote and directed the piece. There is a genuine sense of innocence that pervades the film and it is as intriguing as the final hyped-up fight, while the depressive view of a suffocating world that Rocky lives in easily brings to mind Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" at times. Thumbs up.",Rocky Balboa
273,cny_cd,"One of the best films of the ""Rocky"" series",9,26 December 2007,"I'll admit it, when I went to see this movie I had very low expectations. Rocky V was simply horrible, and I thought that this film might fall into that mold, but I was wrong. This film has a great story, great acting, and is a very heartwarming and inspirational film. The boxing itself takes a backseat to the subplot of Rocky's relationship with his son, and how he deals with the ghosts of the past. Rocky definitely goes out the same way he came in. Watch this one when you need some inspiration, or when life is beating you down. Definitely worth seeing, and one of the best of the Rocky series. 9 out of 10",Rocky Balboa
274,crukeg,Yes Yes Yes this is what its all about- bravo Sly,10,27 June 2007,"Rocky Balboa is without a doubt the best sequel in the rocky series.

A young title holder called Mason Dixon is pitted against Rocky in a computer fight, which says that Balboa would be victorious. Rocky accepts a challenge from Dixon and fights him with great spirit.Rocky loses in the end but who the hell cares?

275,stephengraley,Absolutely Shocking,1,16 January 2007,"""How are you Doing"" I thought i was watching Joey from Friends, every 5 Seconds Stallone was asking every Character he bumped into ""How are you doing"" I was waiting for Monica to run on screen and shout ""It's the Humidity"".In fact the Script and acting were so bad that Joey could have written and starred in this. This was shocking on a Whole new Level, why did you do it ?? Was it the money because i hope not, i can only imagine it was for a final Hoorah at Stardom to get his name in lights a final time.I am not going to moan anymore about this film as to be honest i would not know where to start but in typing this sentence i must point out one thing. In the other Rocky Films his training for the fights lasted longer than a 30 Second Montage we had here which culminated in the, yes you guessed run up the steps in his grey tracksuit to jump around like he had just received his pension.Please, oh please Don't Subject us to Rocky 7, The year 2050 Civilization has Crumbled and the world has torn itself apart, Boxing is the only break in the turgid life known to man.

276,puffball97,"Hang Up Your Gloves, Sly. You're Past Your Prime.",2,14 January 2007,"Yes, as we get older, and we accrue gray hairs, wrinkles, aches, pains, and illnesses, we all want to go back to our young days when we looked beautiful and were able to do so much more. In the case of Sylvester Stallone in ""Rocky Balboa,"" it is boxing. Rocky is a near 60-year-old widowed retired boxer now owner of Adrian's restaurant who wants to relive his glory days and fight once more in the ring in Vegas against thirtysomething contender Mason the Line Dixon (played by real-life boxer Antonio Tarver).The cloying sentiment goes on and on as Stallone, once again writer-director-star, tries hard to bleed tears from the audience, with shots at him at Adrian's gravesite, his breaking out and crying to Paulie (Burt Young, the only cast member who has appeared in ""all"" six films), his grown, estranged stockbroker son who calls himself ""Robert, Jr."" and only exists in the shadow of his father, and to us. The black and white flashbacks of Talia Shire, so bored in sequel after sequel that Stallone decided to kill her off, and scenes from the previous Rocky movies during the fight scenes, also add to the mawkishness. These flashbacks were not done the first time in any Rocky film. In ""Rocky IV,"" there were ongoing flashbacks in color where Stallone is driving, and they included Rocky Jr.'s birth and Mickey's (the late Burgess Meredith) death to remind us what a great franchise Rocky was.Even scenes with Little Marie(Geraldine Hughes), half Rocky's age, trying to build up Rocky and developing a platonic relationship doesn't help. Then for more hokum, there is a dog so named Punchy (Ha! Ha!) with Rocky runs up in his arms with on the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps. The only interesting part of the movie was the fight scene which Rocky does win, but not physically. The colorful Vegas cinematography beautifully contrasts the drab,grimy,dilapidated Philadephia scenery that suggests the mood that as Rocky ages rapidly, so does the neighborhood. It's been 16 years that ""Rocky V"" came out, and the franchise did outwear its welcome, like many other ongoing franchises that started fresh and then got old. That usually happens with the Roman numeral III. So it was a surprise that Sylvester Stallone wanted to do one more Rocky film. But ""Rocky Balboa"" clearly suggests that it has run out of gas, and has done so well in the box office this holiday season. And in the theater I was in, all eyes were dry. I think this is Stallone's biggest ego trip of all time and I did not feel sorry for Rocky as he went through his late-in-life crisis. Also, at the end of every movie, I remember the audience clapping and screaming loudly as he won the fights. Not in this one. There were more yawns and groans than applause.",Rocky Balboa
277,kevintempel,Real Rocky,9,11 January 2007,"Wow! yesterday I went to the cinema to see the last Rocky movie. It was great. It was sort of like it started with Rocky 30 years ago. Stallone in excellent shape and doing a great acting job. But the one playing the world Champion was in fact not that muscular as you would expect from a boxer. But who cares, Rocco, as Paulie calls him, was great.I hear it's coming a Rambo 4 also. I wonder if he can get it back to the style as the first Rambo film was. The great one. Then he really is a genius.Stallone have gotten lots of crap thrown at him for being a poor actor, but that is bullshit. The ones saying it have of course never come so far as he has. he is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, so...who's a bad actor?He is a real action hero, he have chosen different sort of movies, but most of them have always made its money.

278,peter-bruck,And in the end....,9,18 January 2008,"This sequel was necessary. It put an end to a story that's timeless, full of heart, melancholic and inspiring. I think with ""Rocky Balboa"" Stallone really made up for part 4 and 5, which were unbearable and stupid, especially compared to the first movie. Like Rocky 1, Rocky Balboa was honest, simple and it came straight from the heart. No anti- communist propaganda, no Rocky kayoing some bump in the streets, just a story about fighting for fightings sake, about never giving up, about growing old, about friends and family, about everything that matters in life. And the most important thing: I felt Rocky again. I wasn't just seeing him like in Rocky 3 and 4, he was actually there. People should see this movie, no matter whether or not they like Stallone or boxing. This movie is about so much more, because the story is true. Thanx, Sly. It really ain't over till it's over.",Rocky Balboa
279,gargantuaboy,Training montage comes too quickly into the film.,9,7 April 2007,"The best thing about ""ROCKY BALBOA"" is Stallone's amazing heartfelt performance. The other thing is it is so far beyond the last two Rocky films, it's as if they were never made. One thing I had a problem with. The ""Gonna Fly Now"" training montage seemed to come a little too quickly into the story. When you look at the first three Rocky movies, we get to see Rocky struggling through his training sessions. Sometimes his training goes so poorly Rocky wonders if he should just quit. Then something wonderful happens like Adrian awakes from a coma and says ""WIN!"" or Adrian gives Rocky a great speech on the beach, and then the music starts and Rocky trains with his heart and sole and everything is happy and wonderful in Rocky's world. Not in ""ROCKY BALBOA."" The one and only time we get to see Rocky train, it is the ""Gonna Fly Now"" scene.The way the film plays now, before any training we see Rocky sitting alone in the cemetery and Rocky Jr. comes up to him and tells Rocky he has just quit his job and wants to be with his father for the fight. The next scene is Duke telling Rocky about all the things he can't do because he is too old and all that. The VERY NEXT SCENE is the training montage. It's damn good, but it is just too quick into the story.When I saw the deleted scenes on the ""ROCKY BALBOA"" DVD, I noticed something very interesting. There is a deleted scene where Rocky is sparring against a man who is knocking Rocky around pretty good. Rocky looks very depressed and looks like he's gonna quit. Paulie and Marie exchange worried looks. Now this scene should have STAYED IN THE FILM!! The next scene should have been Rocky sitting in the cemetery alone. Now it would look as if not only is Rocky thinking about Adrian, he is now wondering if he should really have this fight with Mason Dixon. Rocky has the weight of the world on his shoulders. Rocky's son comes up and tells him he just quit his job and will be there for him. When father and son hug, we NOW hear the first few notes of ""Gonna Fly Now""!!!! That would have been a great ""ROCKY"" moment!! It also makes the scene with the son so much more important to the story. Another note on the training montage, I think Sly made a mistake not to have Rocky run through the market place. It would have been a great happy ""Rocky"" moment reminiscent of the first two films,. The film is very damn good the way it is, it just could have been GREAT. Sly talks about doing a directors cut on the DVD, so let's hope he makes this change!!",Rocky Balboa
280,TexVanWinkle,A strong finish,7,27 January 2007,"It's possible this is an 8/10 instead of the 7 I'm giving it, on account of the pitiful presentation of it I just experienced, but I think I'm right on the money.The movie certainly is right about a lot. Stallone's gift as a writer is his ability to invest story lines that on paper sound implausible with enough realism and humanity to make them plausible, at least to some degree. Rocky 5 finally sounded too gimmicky to me and I never got around to seeing it. Rocky 4, which I did see at least once, stretched the familiar storyline almost too much. This new movie, however, gets it just about right. It's almost as good as the first two, and at least as good as the third. The wisdom and mileage that Stallone has gained, the film gains. (That's the nutshell. Read farther at your own risk.)Stallone brings Balboa back down to earth in this one, most notably with Adrian having died. I understand this was not what Talia Shire preferred at first, but Stallone couldn't find the emotional meat he wanted with her in it. I happen to think Talia Shire's instincts were better on that score. Stallone and Shire were so touching together in the first couple of films that this one lacked an emotional center and closure that I missed and would have preferred. I realize Stallone was attempting to create and address a similar hole in Rocky's life. I think from the point of view of concluding a saga, though, he could have achieved much the same end by having her die in the film instead of in the back-story, and allowed audiences to connect with that character, and wonderful love storythis time as an older married coupleone more time before saying goodbye. Rocky got that closure in the back-story of the film; the audience never does. Yeah, I would have like that a lot.But back to the movie as it actually is. It does succeed in almost all respects. It's realistic about the characters and the circumstances surrounding each of them without being overly maudlin, and Stallone treats the nostalgia with a deft touch. The only thing truly jarring about the film, and which directly detracted from it for me and my wife, is the final fight sequence. All of the previous films, as well as I can remember, used montage sequences to flit through the middle of the fights, but they did so in straightforward fashion, showing clearly a punch here, a punch there, and the psychological war going on between the two men. The rapid cycling and color juxtapositions in this final fight are simply too jarring and hard to follow, and took me completely out of it. The fight would have been much better had Stallone lost the MTV stylingwhich was completely out of place with the rest of the film (and, for that matter, the entire series)and focused more clearly on the arcs happening inside both Balboa and Dixon as the fight progresses. You know, like the older, better films did. As it is, it feels rushed and the impact lost. I was very disappointed with the fight.But the final moments are nice, with Stallone getting back to the proper rhythm and tone, enough so that the disappointment of the fight is mitigated. If I seem overly critical, it's because of what's invested in the film. I grew up with these films and wanted this one to be great. Stallone had a tall task in front of him in this film, and it's a testament to his instincts that he got so much about it right. The film is a nice conclusion to a beloved seriesand era of film-making, franklyand whatever its faults, just like its hangdog, against-all-odds protagonist, it manages to stir the heart a little and make us feel better for having known it. Nowcue that music.",Rocky Balboa
281,cwilson-46,Unexpected - Very Good!!!,8,5 May 2008,"I thought to myself - oh no. Sly - your over 60 - you will surely die in the ring and look a little silly at the same time.Surprising enough, this movie was great. Great lead up to the fight and everything about it was entertaining.Sly looked good, except for the old guy veins that were bulging everywhere.You don't have to be a Rocky fan to watch this movie. This movie stands alone by itself.Good beginning, middle and the end is fantastic and worth the wait.Funny dialogue, funny scenes back and forth.Good flash backs. One thing through, I didn't catch what happened to Adrian. Did anyone else?",Rocky Balboa
282,conmech,It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward,9,18 October 2008,"Even though we all know Sylvester Stallone as an actor, in my opinion he's a better director than many directors in Hollywood. I had seen the ""John Rambo"" movie and also the trailer of this film, so I knew it was going to be a lot better than people feared it would be.In this movie you can see the core aspects of what makes a classic Rocky movie. It's not a boxing movie. It's a movie about life, and how to handle it. It's about facing the troubles of life, taking the hits, and still keep moving forward. It's an inspiration for the ""underdogs"", who have nothing in their hand but their will, their heart, and their determination. Believe it or not, watching this film made me wake up from my depression and decide to get back on my feet to fight again.And the ending was also very meaningful. I was expecting an ending like this, because what Rocky was after wasn't a title, or points. He was after getting over himself, his troubles, and getting back the love of his fans. He got up there and fought the way he wanted, and that was all it mattered to him, and he was happy just like he won the match. Even this ending should be a lesson for everyone. That doing something you like and live for doesn't rely on results. The only thing that matters is you go out there and do what you do best, and give your best to it.The shooting was beautiful. It had the ambiance of the old Rocky movies. Also, I loved the credits part where they show many people climbing the stairs where Rocky used to and doing funny boxing moves. Even that made me feel emotional. By the way, I didn't even know if Rocky was going to win or lose so I watched the match really excited like watching a real boxing match, shouting ""stand up God dammit!"" As a conclusion, ""Rocky Balboa"" is a beautiful-must see movie. Enjoy it...",Rocky Balboa
283,Egg_MacGuffin,Rocky...if it sucked.,3,9 March 2009,"I saw this for free in the theater and I have to say that it was definitely worth what I paid for it.I couldn't help but notice the very awkward change of pace that happened once the fight was set up. There's an hour or more spent on Adrian not being there, Rocky running a restaurant, characters that don't amount to anything, etc.It has a cool, leisurely pace at this point, but once the fight is set, there's a 2-minute training montage and the next thing you know, they're in Vegas. It felt as though someone hit fast-forward just to get to the fight quicker.And once the fight did happen, I didn't seem to care. There was no mystery at all. Rocky was fighting for personal reasons that were resolved regardless of whether or not he won, lost, went the distance, etc. He just wanted to let loose the beast inside, and it's never in doubt that he would do so with relative ease.He has no problems getting back into shape and fighting the greatest fighter in the sport that day even after a long furlough. During the fight, Dixon is the one who gets hurt and has to fight harder to survive, not Rocky. Hell, the computer even said Rocky would pound Dixon's ass, so where is Rocky's external struggle? There was no question as to whether or not Rocky would accomplish his goal because his goal was never displayed in any physical way. How do we know if he's vanquished the demons within if all we see is him taking a pounding, giving a pounding, and then taking another pounding? I didn't see any progress toward his goal from the point he stepped into the ring to when the final bell rang.The supporting characters were drawn very weak. Paulie is back for no reason other than because he was in the original film. Then he loses his job? What's that all about? Why did it have to happen and what did that amount to? Rocky's son quits his job but is never shown taking a second step forward after that. It's never resolved. Marie was semi-interesting, but clearly just pasted in because there had to be some kind of female interest for the male lead. But like I mentioned before, no mystery in this story. Rocky verbally states that Adrian is/was the only woman for him, so why bring Marie into the picture? She's obviously not going to hook up with Rocky, and it makes her seem like a fifth wheel (her son serving even less of a purpose).Even the dog didn't do it for me. The only reason the dog was there was because Rocky had a dog in the original, but in the first Rocky film, the dog served a purpose (a symbol of Adrian's love for Rocky). In the new film, the dog is there and gone again as though it wasn't even needed in any way at all.This film exists only as a paycheck for Stallone. It simply does not function on it's own merit, must rests entirely on the audience's love for the quality of the original Rocky. In other words, there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. You get nothing new from it. Just watch the original Rocky film instead.",Rocky Balboa
284,kingmonkey,"the circle is complete, once more from the heart",7,8 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa is a great film. If you have any doubts about seeing it, be they for the suspicion of a preconceived idea of Stallone and/or the character to be too old for a plausible plot or your disappointment with the sequels, V in particular, drop them.At heart this is a true follow-up to Rocky & Rocky II, insomuch as it goes back to a pure, heartfelt character driven plot. I would not want to give away anything, but what we get is a Rocky Balboa who has moved on in years and experiences, yet is still at heart the same guy we first met back in the very first film in the 70's. Older, maybe wiser, but still with the, as it were, eye of the tiger.In many respects Stallone and the rest could have done a nostalgic sleepwalk through a film, but what you get is some great performances. Stallone and Burt Young return to perhaps their most famous characters impeccably, and the new additions are great - ""Rocky Junior"" deserves extra special note here.Much as Rocky III personified the glitz, glamour and prestige of World Heavyweight Boxing in the 80's, so Rocky Balboa presents 21st Century Heavyweight Boxing - seemingly bereft of characters, passion and the huge attention it used to demand. If this film in some way can help the world of boxing recapture former glories and status, then so much the better.One can't see a seventh chapter in the life of the Italian Stallion, and nor would it been needed - should this be the last time we see Rock, what a great way to bow out. Take any chance you get to see one of cinema's true modern greats revel in playing one of cinema's greatest, most inspired and inspiring characters for one more round.",Rocky Balboa
285,JonTMarin816,Sly and script almost KO'd Rocky VI,7,23 January 2007,"16 years after the dreadful Rocky V, Stallone is back in the ring for the highly anticipated Rocky Balboa. This time around Balboa is brought back into the ring by hype stemmed from a fight simulation seen on TV pitting him against a younger and tougher opponent Mason Dixon. Best known for knocking out then champ Roy Jones Jr., boxer Antonio Tarver takes on Balboa in this installment. For people, like me, that aren't too familiar with previous Rocky films, this one has a very nostalgic feel. Most of the film you're sitting through flashback scenes and eager for the actual fight. This ordeal becomes dragged out and tedious quickly. Another minor problem with the film is the horrendous speech of Slyvester Stallone. Not only has he aged terribly but his slurred speech is the worst thing I've ever heard in my life. I can't go without mentioning the cheesy dialogue in this film. However, the entire film serves as great pre-fight entertainment for the actual fight. Minor distractions (Sly's speech slur, dialogue and overly dramatic flashback scenes) still can't take down this film and the incredible final duel between Dixon and Balboa.Rocky Balboa - **1/2 out of ****",Rocky Balboa
286,moviefan1725-1,Rocky Balboa....A Worthy Final Round,10,23 December 2006,"There are very few characters in American movie history that are more iconic than Rocky Balboa. Ever since 1977 he has been THE symbol of the underdog. He has been the personification of the never-say-die American spirit. No matter what anybody else tells you, the most important thing you can do is believe in yourself. The film series is a phenomenon almost unequaled in popularity. The first four films in the series all finished among the top 5 box office grossers of their respective years. The fifth film met with a substantially smaller reception. What was supposed to be Rocky's swan song, instead came across as a lame duck. From the stories I've heard over the years, I would put the blame more on the studio than on Sylvester Stallone, and those associated with the film's production. But regardless of where the finger gets pointed, Rocky V left moviegoers with a bad taste in their mouths, and it cast a shadow over what the series had achieved up to that point. But now, both Rocky and Stallone have both come full circle. When the movie was pitched to theaters, Stallone was nearly laughed out of the building. When the news came that there would be another Rocky film, audiences either groaned or laughed. Did the world need another Rocky film? No...but Stallone did. Rocky is the reason the man ever had a career to begin with. He shared people's disappointment with Rocky V, and wanted to make it right. Like Rocky himself, Stallone believed in himself, in his talent, and in his creation, and knew there was a deeply human chapter of Rocky's life that was yet to be told. In spite of all those that laughed at him, Stallone now has the last laugh. This is an amazing movie, and a fitting final chapter in Rocky's saga. The film opens with Rocky in a perpetual state of mourning. His beloved Adrian has died, his son is almost a stranger, and the throngs that once chanted his name seem to have forgotten him. He lives a simple life running a restaurant named after his late wife. He poses for pictures, and recalls his old boxing stories to his diners. His grief over Adrian, and peoples' insistence on hearing his stories keep Rocky living in the past. He feels there is nothing left but memories of the glory days. Then ESPN hold a computer simulated bout between Rocky (in his prime), and the current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. Dixon is a put upon champion who doesn't get much respect because his fights end too quickly, and the world doesn't think much of him as a champion because he doesn't fight anyone that possesses any real skill. When the simulated fight predicts that Rocky would be the winner, Dixon's people come up with a plan. An exhibition fight between Balboa and Dixon would not only provide a financial windfall, but might raise the opinion that people have for Dixon by fighting a legendary champion. Like the original film, this is where Rocky's story and Stallone's story seem to merge into one. When it is announced that Rocky is coming out of retirement, there is laughter and ridicule. No one thinks Rocky stands a chance, and more than a few jokes are made at his expense. But the doesn't dampen his spirit or his drive. He knows what he has inside, or as Rocky puts it ""in the basement"". When he shows up to fight, he shows that anything is possible if you just believe in what you know you can do. This is undoubtedly the same thing Stallone went through to get the movie made, and he pours that experience and those feelings into his movie. When the final fight gets into full swing, I dare you to try and sit still in your seat. One of the biggest surprises of this film is that it does not make Mason Dixon a monster. He is not out to destroy Rocky. In fact Rocky and Dixon aren't that different. Dixon knows what he is capable of, and has had it with people telling him he can't compete with a skilled opponent. He believes in himself, and only wants the respect he knows he deserves. Dixon is closer to Apollo Creed than Clubber Lang. But the movie is not about defeating the bad guy. It's about the power of the human spirit, and not ever giving up on the things that are important to you, even if the rest of the world tells you to. At an early part of the movie Rocky pleads his case to the boxing commission that refuses to grant him a license. He says that the older he gets, the more he loses. But that's life. But what he has not lost is his heart. He has not lost his passion. It was always there, but just needed the chance to be shown again. He only needed to make everyone else believe. My hat is off to Sylvester Stallone for taking such a huge risk on a project that he KNEW was going to get him laughed at from the start. Stallone is not the box office powerhouse that he was in the 80's. If this film failed, he would've been lucky to get direct-to-video movies made for the rest of his career. But like his creation, he believed in himself, and let nothing stand in his way. Rocky walks out of the ring with his head and his hands held high. Sylvester Stallone can do the same. Bravo Mr. Stallone!",Rocky Balboa
287,mjscarface,"Exactly what Rocky, Stallone and us Rocky fans needed!",8,19 January 2007,"I was never able to see Rocky at the cinema before this came out, but I grew up the these films and 'Rocky' is my favorite film. It's inspiring, truthful and charming - EXACTLY what 'Rocky Balboa' is! Stallone has cracked it! And good on him.Not so dissimilar from his own career, Stallone has shown Rocky at his most vulnerable ever. After having lost Adrian to cancer, the old boxer has trouble connecting with his son and is starting to feel like the same sort of nobody he was 30 years before. With his glory days long gone, Rocky's/Stallone's face tells the whole story - there is such a need for last hurrah that you can feel it.After the disappointing street brawl that was supposed to be Rocky's final victory, it's such a joy to see the old timer climb into the ring and prove himself to the world. Although Rocky II is a cracking follow-up and Rocky IV is brilliantly awful, it is 'Rocky Balboa' that has the thematic and emotional truth of the original.Thanks Sly.",Rocky Balboa
288,baz_trinity,Not bad at all,7,4 March 2007,"...And certainly the second best 'Rocky' out there.The story is pretty simple, one would expect for such a movie and there'd be nothing worse than trying to be over-complex with the subject matter. Basically, Rocky is pretty bummed in life, his son is annoyed with him for over-shadowing his own achievements, his wife Adrian has died and times are changing. Alas, when a computer-generated mock-up fight of current heavyweight champion, Mason 'the Line' Dixon, against The Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa, is shown on television, demands amongst boxing fans ensue for an actual fight between the two. Rocky regains his fighting spirit and a determination to take up the opportunity, which leads to an unforgettable Rocky grand finale.A lot of the movie however, is surprisingly slow-paced. Not necessarily a bad thing though, it does allow for intriguing scenes of character depth, especially in Balboa himself, but don't expect a fast, intense 'boxing' movie, as it primarily aims towards more of a sentimental story of Rockys fall and rise, which no doubt implies a strong sense of morality.The last quarter however, on the contrary, is an adrenaline fuelled tour de force shining Rocky's impeccable strength and determination, which is not only emotionally inspirational, but an excellent ending to the Rocky series.It is a great movie, not quite as good as Rocky, but I hardly expected it to be. Although flawed in parts, perhaps one too many clichés, it will definitely satisfy Rocky fans and movie fans alike.",Rocky Balboa
289,tony-camel,Okay if you're a fan...,5,5 March 2007,"n fact the most disquieting aspect of the film is that it was shot between 2003 and 2005, meaning that, however bad daily life seemed then, things have grown far worse since the camera was switched off. Director James Longley would no doubt concur but, cleverly, he never makes his own views explicit, preferring to let the images speak for themselves.And speak they do, whether it's the first section of the film in which 11-year-old Sunni boy Mohammed is forced to choose between work and education or, better still, a up-close look at the Shiite political/religious group run by Moqtada al-Sadr.The third strain of the film retreats from the extremes of the first two parts  by way of emphasising that these are ordinary folk unfortunate enough to live in extraordinary times  and focuses on rural Kurdish families and, in particular, fathers and sons.Throughout, it's shot so brilliantly that it feels less like a documentary than a superior drama. Best of all, though, is Longley's compassionate depiction of people to whom, crucially, we can all relate.",Rocky Balboa
290,JimS_8686,Sucky Balboa: Sly's Mid-life Crisis on Celluloid,1,15 March 2007,"After hearing rave reviews for this film, I decided to give it a chance. I suppose it was made about as well as it could have been given the extremely far-fetched premise, but Sucky Balboa is more about Stallone's vanity than anything else. The actor/ filmmaker obviously pines for the days when he used to one of the biggest names in Hollywood. After appearing in one flop after another for the past two decades, he has now decided to return to the big screen as one of his only two successful film personas - Ramblow being the other. The underdog story of the first five films is copied once again here, with the added twist of his beloved wife Adrian having passed away since his last remake of Sucky I. So, instead of countless scenes of Adrian begging Sucky not to fight, we are subjected to scenes of him talking to Adrian's tombstone. Fans of the first 5 Sucky films have of course already seen this and orgasmed over it, but obviously that crowd's very easy to please - considering every Sucky sequel has been nothing more scene by scene remake of the first ""Sucky"". Stallone has claimed his prime motivation for making this film was for his legions of Sucky fans, but the film seems like just another excuse to show off his well-oiled, waxed upper torso. This, his defunct ""Sly"" magazine, and failed reality show attempt to show the world that no matter how old you are, you can always be a 'contender'. Unfortunately, his botoxed mug and Jintropin bust in Australia undermine this point. Sucky Balboa is nothing more than an advertisement for steroids, hair plugs and botox injections for middle-aged men trying to turn back the clock. Drinking glasses of raw eggs will only cause your cholesterol level to skyrocket. The target audience for Sucky 6 are mentally challenged individuals who need to be spoon-fed their entertainment, much like Schiavo had to be fed her food through a feeding tube. Stallone's freakish plastic surgery is difficult enough to look at on the small screen. The maudlin ending where they show Rocky repeatedly come out and bow to standing ovations seems like it goes on for an eternity. This movie is grotesque on many levels. Rocky 6 can best be described as a chick flick for homosexuals. The razzie award winner for worst actor of the century has done it again. What a pathetic piece of garbage.",Rocky Balboa

I have loved the Rocky movies since I was a child and I can still watch them 100 times over and never get tired of them with the exception of Part 5. After reading some good reviews on the movie I went to the theater to watch it. I must say it is fabulous! It feels very close to the original. It it well written and a very heartwarming movie. I cried a few times during some parts. I actually forgot that this was a movie and not real life. I felt like I was experiencing what the characters felt. It's just wonderful. Stallone was great as well as Burt Young. If you are a fan of the Rocky movies you will love this, trust me, and if you don't then you really aren't a fan in the first place.

We all know what to expect from a Rocky movie after watching the first five, but this one went beyond them all for me. Being almost 50 yrs old, and seeing countless movies, it takes a truly inspiring movie for me to label it as ""incredibly inspiring"". Rocky personifies the wise man,the ""dumb as a fox"", icon in this great movie about overcoming. It is touching to see Rocky's interaction with Paulie, Marie, and Robert, his son. Besides being a warrior, Rocky paints the screen with compassion and strength of character -- the quotes are innumerable. ""Welcome to Rocky Land""",Rocky Balboa
295,heckchap,A Big Philly Cheese Sandwich (SPOILERS),4,14 December 2006,"I saw this movie at the charity celebrity premiere at Mann's Chinese in Hollywood.What a weird, schizophrenic flick, that really brings nothing new to the table. There are a handful of scenes with really good dialogue, that make you think ""yeah, Stallone really remembers how to do this stuff."" Sadly, just about every moment in the movie that rocks is in the trailer.The first half to two-thirds of the movie is horribly edited and slow, and all of the early stuff with Rocky wandering Philly bemoaning Adrian's death, and visiting just about every place he and her once went is maudlin, and frankly embarrassing. There's ""cutesy slapstick"" from Rocky that goes on way past its ""Best By"" date (any movie that has to trot out a ""loveable dog"" to make the audience go ""awww"", but then pretty much forget about it for the rest of the flick, is really clutching at straws), and underwritten characters abounding. A couple of shots hint maddeningly at a bond between Rocky's son (Milo Ventimiglia from ""Heroes"" and actually pretty good with material that doesn't require him to do anything) and the son of a waitress Rocky latches on to, but then does nothing with it. Characters appear, and are largely forgotten about. Stallone has little grasp at keeping the movie's elements together.Antonio Tarver as Mason Dixon has got to be the blandest adversary I've ever seen in a movie. The guy has no charisma whatsoever. Casting him was a huge mistake.Lowlight of the movie has to be a frankly-freakish Mike Tyson taunting Rocky's opponent from the ringside.The final boxing match? Oh, boy. Stallone should have been forced to watch ""Cinderella Man"" over and over to at least give him an idea of how movies in this decade are made.The movie feels like a low-octane remake of the first Rocky, complete with sequences basically lifted from that movie (the highlights of the film). It's not that it's a bad movie...it's just a ""Meh"" movie. You'll likely catch yourself watching it on TV. For me, ""Rocky IV"" is still the most enjoyable. In fact, meeting Lundgren at the party afterwards was the highlight of the night. He's still physically impressive: hell, I'd hire the guy for a movie in a second. He made himself accessible at the party, posing for pictures with anyone who came up to him. (Sly, on the other hand, was sequestered away on the raised MGM Bigwig stage, hemmed in by bouncers that refused admittance to anyone without the VIP Pass,and made himself available for photos only once or twice at the evening's very end. Considering all of the publicity mongering Sly's been doing on ""Aint It Cool"", he could have scored some points by actually working the party a little.) I love Stallone as a screen presence. I just wish he'd give up the directing and writing reins, stop shoving his nose into interfering with producers, and just let a talented filmmaker really play to his strengths while his career still allows him time, and give us one more powerhouse performance that shows what he's capable of.I have no idea if this movie will make money, because it lacks momentum and tension, and I just can't figure out who the audience is it's supposed to be playing to.",Rocky Balboa
296,joseph t,A good way to end the 'Rocky' series (hopefully),8,10 June 2009,"A lot of people seem not to like this film, but I liked it, primarily for nostalgic reasons. And, of course, the screenplay is heavily into remembrance of the past stories, touched with the circumstances and needs of Rocky's current life. He obviously grieves for Adrian, and that colors much of Rocky's outlook, but there are other demons that must be confronted and excised. And, for those who have been there themselves, this is familiar and real. For these reasons, Rocky the Fighter becomes Rocky the Everyman. And the two become synonymous.Stallone is his usual dominating presence, but his supporting cast deserves kudos, from old rival, later friend and trainer 'Duke', to seemingly minor characters like 'Spider Rico' and 'Marie'. Burt Young as brother-in-law Paulie presents a slightly more mellow and softer side than his earlier turns, which were more of the brutish and thuggish ""loser"". Rival boxer 'Mason Dixon' and his handlers are even offered in a somewhat sympathetic and appealing manner.In the end, Rocky is able to loose the beast within and find a measure of personal redemption, inner peace, and closure, and that is a fitting and satisfying way to end the Rocky saga. He does it his way, in the ring, engaged in the sport he loves that has shaped his life, but also in the quiet of his grieving and memories at Adrian's grave. We know that Rocky will endure and fight on, if not in the ring then in life, because it is what he does. And that is a fitting message to leave us with, because it is what we all do.",Rocky Balboa

It's very real the way it shows how life passes and people grow old but it doesn't means the end.And the fight ... oh God, I remembered again that ice rock inside the stomach when watching Rocky Balboa fighting on the ring with apparently little chance to win and then ... well, it's just very nice.It's one of the nicest movies I've seen in 2006.

299,ronnay_barkay,Inspirational Stuff,8,23 December 2007,"This is a very ""real"" movie. Perhaps because you get the feeling Stallone himself wants to prove himself as a film-maker and storyteller to the world so he won't be remembered just as an action hero. This translates beautifully in the movie, where he doesn't use big-name actors, but uses good actors who fit the rolls very well for this low-key but honest end to the Rocky saga.Now in his 60's, Rocky is doing well for himself. Still living in the same neighborhood he grew up in, now running a restaurant which he named after his beloved wife Adrian. He has one grown up son who is trying to make it in the world, but is reluctant to see his Dad because he feels everything he's got is due to him having the Balboa name.In one scene, when Rocky tells his son he's going to step into the ring one last time, his son pleads with him not to and Rocky tells him it's a nasty evil world out there and it will beat you to your knees if you let it, but succeeding is not about how hard you can hit, but how hard you can get hit and still move forward. He delivers these lines with all the emotion they deserve. The supporting cast are rock-solid and believable. Stallone gets back to his roots one last time and pulls it off superbly.",Rocky Balboa

And I thought this would be 10 times better than Rocky 5. But it was honestly very boring. And it did not feel like a Rocky Film at all. I think the main reason I didn't like it, was because it tried to be realistic. The Rocky films were never like that! Rocky 4 had a Russian boxer who could hit damage of 2,000 pounds for Christ sake. And this film tries to make it seem like it happened in real life, and that they were tougher boxers back then. It's so dumb, cause it leaves plotholes with the real life pro fighters like if Mike Tyson was always in this universe, why didn't he fight Rocky? And the final fight was very poor. Tried to look like a Television fight, instead of a classic all out Rocky fight. Dumb editing as well. So overall, I'm very disappointed with this movie. Rocky 5 was better than this garbage.

But one that saves itself for one good punch.Sylvester Stallone writes, directs and stars in all the ""Rocky"" stories.In ""Rocky Balboa"", Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is a retired former champion of the ring. He now owns an Italian restaurant and entertains his patrons with his stories of glory days. Remembered as one of the greatest boxer of all time, his fans love him. Days without boxing can be so hard for a former champ.The current boxing world has a new champion, young, fast, skillful, undefeated but unappreciated. He is a champion that never really proved himself. He was never really tested in the ring. They say he hasn't got the heart of a real champion. It was all too easy. Unloved, hated and booed, he's a tortured figure who is pained as much as he had anger. His name is Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver).Heavyweight boxing is becoming a bore until a computer simulation cast the two of them together in a virtual match. An old great vs a young champ proves to be highly marketable. Suddenly there came an opportunity for the two boxers to release what they had inside of them. One that says he still has one good fight in him, and the other to tell the world that he is worthy of the title.Sports films are always made out to be inspirational. Rocky Balboa is the inspiration.There is a lot of character in this movie. One can tell by observing the settings of this film. The scenes held deep meanings, if one is sensitive enough. The stories behind each character move the story slowly into a fitting end. Rocky is punching his way into the hearts of others. That punch gained strength towards the final showdown.The body ages but the heart remains strong seems to be the message. Life in itself is constantly throwing those punches at you, getting you down, putting you off track. Without realization you look in the mirror and maybe you cannot even recognize yourself anymore. Time to look within. Fall victim or pick yourself up and clench those fists? What are you made of?After all, fighters fight. Right?",Rocky Balboa
302,jtana1,Good ending,6,5 March 2020,"The great Balboa returned after being absent for a long time and he does well, this delivery is more mature and thoughtful so it is super to give it a good ending. In my opinion, Rocky 3, Rocky 4 and Rocky 5 are not good, they have been more of the same, with 1, 2 and 6 would have been more than enough to enjoy this great boxer.The good: Rocky's impetus to fight and prove that age is not a limit (although for this type of sports it can be high risk)The bad: the same sequences that have been seen in the other films, and his opponent who is not intimidating, seems like a rapper.Interesting.",Rocky Balboa
303,VincentBauer,Rocky Lives Again!,10,17 January 2007,"As I write this review in my apartment I listen to the famous ""gonna fly now"" song and I feel as if I have just seen the first movie. The first Rocky first introduced to what is now my third favorite sport (below football and basketball). It was where I realized what heart you have to have to be a boxer. A great one to say at the most.In this movie, Rocky has retired to a quiet life. He daily visits Adrian's grave with Paulie, and owns a restaurant called ""Adrian's."" He once in a while comes into his's son's workplace to invite him to dinner which he rarely comes even if accepted as his relationship with him is poor. He also continues to suffer from his age.Meanwhile the new championship heavyweight Mason Dixon is having trouble with the boxing press and audience as he is knocking out his victims too fast and he still hasn't lost making the game to be getting a bit too boring.Then in a ESPN special event involving a computer fight between Rocky and Dixon showing that Rocky would win. This gets Rocky thinking which causes him to want to fight one last time. While straining to regain a boxing license and train for the match people begin to say that the ""old man"" will die in the ring.I won't spoil the end, but I will tell you that the end is a bit uplifting. At the end you will be cheering (maybe in your mind) ROCKY! This isn't better than the first Rocky, but it's just as good and worth the view, unlike the other four movies.Rocky Balboa 10/10",Rocky Balboa
304,JKolman,Words can't describe...,10,11 June 2012,"...Just how much I love this movie. My father was 27 when the first Rocky came out, and I was 27 when this final Rocky came along. I've watched it hundreds of times and it never gets old. The character of Rocky is so timeless, so endearing, that you can't help but love him. Stallone does a fantastic job closing the series that so many of us felt was cheated with Rocky V.Kudos to Sly for getting this film made. Nobody believed in Rocky, and I'm sure there were many skeptics when he pitched this idea, but he did it, and it is a wonderful piece of film history.********** out of ten, no question in my mind.ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY",Rocky Balboa
305,pacieterra-1,It's Not Over Till It's Over,9,22 December 2006,"Having never seen any of the original five ""Rocky,"" movies, only short clips on different award shows and Stallone interviews, I can attest to this film's really fine writing, (dialog), plot, actors, (many from previous outings), and gritty South Philadelphia settings. Sly Stallone has re-invented the franchise in writing, directing, and sensitive portrayal of his hard-scrabble boxer. Even at sixty, he still has great presence, and a physique men half his age would die for. Two expositions of verbal passion are highlights. Most of the each characters' dialog is witty and appropriate. Rocky Balboa's last return to a charity exhibition fight, with a very strong African-American real boxer, humorously named Mason Dixon, is brutal, exhilarating, and redemptive. Nevertheless, the door is still open for Rocky to become a trainer in any future films, as Clint Eastwood's character in ""Million Dollar Baby."" Having met Mr. Stallone at his ""Cliffhanger,"" premiere in 1993, what you see of his personality in ""Rocky Balboa,"" is the man, himself! This should garner some award nominations, if not the various icons themselves. This is a perfect bookend to the first, acclaimed ""Rocky,"" and even has outtakes of ordinary humans running the steps of the Philly Museum!",Rocky Balboa

307,kreamykonez97,Rocky on Viagra.,5,31 December 2006,"ROCKY BALBOA 2006 (SYLVESTER STALLONE, GERALDINE HUGHES, ANTONIO TARVER) DIRECTED BY: SYLVESTER STALLONE ~ THE RUNDOWN: After bringing his career to all new heights with Spy Kids 3, Stallone gives us this pointless, predictable and far-fetched 'Rocky' installment. ~ Boy, ol' Sylvester sure is confident of his abilities, isn't he? After disastrous RAMBO and ROCKY sequels, he comes back again writing and directing this cute, happy-go-lucky piece of trash. And, yet, people like it. Why? I don't know...I do know that this egomaniac has no imagination and doesn't have the ability to make films. Here he too easily slips into a retired boxing champion who not only helps the poor and lovingly visits his deceased wife everyday but comes back and gives the modern Mike Tyson a run for his money even though he's almost old enough to be the guy's grandfather. Sure, and one day I'm going to beat Kobe Bryant one on one in basketball. ~ If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favorite and just watch the original a few more times, because that's how pointless this new one is. It's as if someone wanted to do a remake and Sylvester came in and said: ""Hey, that sounds like a good idea, except I want to be in it because I seem to magically not age, so I'll utilize my awesome writing skills and just make some alterations to the original screenplay...you know, give him a cane or something."" ~ Seriously though, I know there are many out there like myself who were rooting for the other guy at the end. Which is not a good thing. But, unless you're an aging Italian who is prejudiced against blacks and/or the youth of America, the movie really doesn't give you a reason to root for Rocky. Too often the screenplay sympathizes with Tarver's character, making him way too likable way too much. In the end, both Stallone and his ego go down for the count in this Hollywood-smothered bore.",Rocky Balboa
308,wyattej2000,Shockingly Good!,9,23 March 2007,"I saw this film (expecting nothing more than closure for a character that I, and we have watched for thirty years) in the theaters when it was released. Well, I walked out of the theater in absolute shock. I could not believe that Stallone, after all of these years could resurrect this character the way he did. At the time I thought the film was a very fitting finale to the series. Much better than Rocky's 3,4,5. After seeing it just recently on DVD, like the first two of the series, the film stands up very well on it's own. As viewers, we know the story, the characters, and the history. Stallone tells a new tale that is not only a logical conclusion to the series, but an emotionally fitting one as well. The movie looked pretty slick over all. I don't understand the statements by previous reviewers, that the film looked cheap and poorly shot. I guess they do not recognize or understand the way Hi-Def looks. This film looks very raw, the way the original did years ago on (dark) film. Critics of the way the film was shot have not substantiated their opinions. I thought it looked clean, and authentic. I felt that this film was greatly over looked by people overall. It is very easy to ""poo-poo"" Stallone, but I think he did a very honest job. For me the only ""commercial"" movie that I thought was a better film than this one last year, was ""The Illusionist,"" (by he way, ""The Departed"" is for the birds,)but that is my opinion, and we all have one. ""Rocky Balboa,like ROCKY will stand for a long time, I think it will do very well on DVD, and be very much appreciated.",Rocky Balboa
309,chubbylove,You can't go wrong with Rocky Balboa...,7,15 January 2007,"I really don't know what people were thinking about giving this film such a hard time. None of the other Rocky films were horrible, why would this one suddenly be? I agree, there were some cheesy things that obviously would have to happen to justify him fighting so old. But, he did a very good job writing in certain twists to make the story make a bit more sense how it could actually happen. I went into the movie expecting scene after scene to be cheesy. I was actually surprised by the lack of cheesiness, granted it had a bit.This was a very heartfelt film. It was definitely going back to the kind of movie the first one was, not spending too much time on the fighting part of the story. The fighting was toned down quite a bit in this one, probably so Stallone could acquire a PG rating.The film is rightfully rated PG, and I would recommend it to any age group. Just a touching story about caring, friendship and love. An excellent way to end the Rocky series...",Rocky Balboa
310,gothamite27,One of the most inspirational films I have ever seen,8,7 February 2007,"I have nothing but praise for Sylvester Stallone, a man I once likened to as an actor who is 'so-bad-he's-good' (a la Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme). This film isn't just inspirational because of Rocky Balboa's comeback, it's just inspirational because of Stallone's comeback as a serious, respected actor. The film shows Rocky pushing sixty following his beloved Adrian's death in a surprisingly undetermined year (most of the Rocky films are products of their time. This one was fairly timeless). Following a computer-generated simulation of what would take place in a battle between Balboa and the new heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon, Balboa wins the fight and a media circus as well as Rocky's instincts tell him to rejoin the world of boxing. Along the way, he bonds with his son as well as making new friends in 'little Marie' from the first film and her son 'Steps'. On an acting standpoint, the film mostly excels. Stallone perfectly portrays a wiser, grown-up version of the lovable simpleton he created in the original films. Burt Young returns as the troubled Paulie, Rocky's best friend and Adrian's brother. The best newcomer in the film is easily Geraldine Hughes, who plays Marie who is well into her forties in this film. Marie is a soft-spoken, pleasant character who has a positive attitude toward life, even if it hasn't been so good to her. I for one, hope Hughes breaks out into more serious roles in the future as she clearly has talent. Antonio Tarver gives a worthy and unique portrayal as Mason Dixon, especially considering the fact that Tarver is a boxer in real life and not an actor. A very nice touch to the film was the inclusion of Tony Burton, Apollo Creed's trainer in the original film and then later Rocky's trainer in subsequent films. From the promotional material, I was very afraid that Stallone was going to jettison anything positive that he generated from the Rocky sequels and just try and pay homage to the original (where Burton didn't really have that big a part) but he is clearly relishing the fourteen-year saga he created and Burton's casting further proves this. The only disappointments from an acting standpoint are the actor who play Rocky's son Robert and the actor who plays 'Steps'. In Rocky V, Robert Balboa was played by Sylvester's real-life son, Sage Stallone and while he wasn't stellar, he was decent and the father-son chemistry between the two was perfect. In this film, however, neither the actor nor the chemistry are particularly good and I spent much of the film wishing that Sage had returned. The actor and the character who played 'Steps' had very little to do in the film and I often wondered why the character was included at all. The film suffers from minor pacing problems, especially at the beginning where Rocky spends about fifteen minutes of screen time moping about in remembrance of Adrian. Also, Rocky only fights once in the whole film, and that is in the climax. Nevertheless, the fight is truly breathtaking and not since the second Rocky film have I been so excited and enthralled by a climactic boxing fight. Above all, this is a truly inspirational film that gives Stallone's most enduring, lovable, unique character, an exit worthy of a king. I recommend this film to anyone who has ever had a dream and anyone who has ever felt insignificant. It'll turn you around.",Rocky Balboa
311,brucewla,A Nice Surprise,8,25 May 2008,"Well the first ""Rocky"" of course was a classic, but the sequels suffered because they tried to add to the great (but standard) story, that was already so brilliantly told in the first film. So when this one was released, I thought, oh, no, ""Rocky VI? That will probably be, just, sad."" I was wrong-Stallone went back to the basics of the story, vis. the point of the story is not the characters themselves, or even the boxing, but that, if you aspire to something, no matter how unlikely, and work hard for it with all you have, you can attain it, no matter how tough life is you can be tougher, etc. It reminds me of what my mother used to say ""tough times don't last, tough people do."" This is the great thing about the ""Rocky"" story at its pure level, a guy with heart, being smacked down by life, keeps plugging and won't give up, and has everybody rooting for him, and when he makes it, we are all even more elated than he is. It's simple way to tell a story but hugely effective.Now, a lot of people make fun of Stallone for being a poor actor. In this role, though, he plays the part beautifully. This is the role for whatever reason he is natural at, I think because the ""Rocky Balboa"" is a lot like him. The action movies he was in, those characters are entertaining to watch, to a degree, but they don't have the realistic personality that Rocky does. I have often read that the easiest role for an actor to play is himself, a great example of that is Stallone playing Rocky.The other reason this movie fits so well, is that it is quite obviously the end of the Rocky story. Rocky is widowed, owns a restaurant (""Italian food cooked by Mexicans"" - CLASSIC) and meets a woman, who, it turns out he used to know when she was a kid down the block. She is sort of like Adrian, quiet, sad, not quite so bashful, and they sort of make it (not so) obvious that she might be a romantic interest, later. Rocky's son is grown up and works in some sort of yuppie high pressure executive position with a jerk boss. He loves his pop, but resents ""lving in his shadow."" Well, the fun starts when some big mouths on ESPN are contemplating what would happen, if a boxer from the past, could fight the current champ, a young guy called Mason Dixon (lol), who, of course, is smart, fast, agile, and fit-Rocky's opponents of course are always better athletes and more skilled, but that's never the point-they don't have HEART! Anyway, the talking heads blab about how an old school fighter can't beat todays stars etc, and they put up a computer simulation that looks like the xbox360 version of ""Fight Night III"" with fighters made to look like Balboa and Dixon (""Cartoony fight"" as Paulie calls it), and the Rocky PC wins, which leads to elation on the part of the Rocky fans, and anger in the Dixon camp. Dixon's handlers then try to get Rocky to actually go through with the fight, an ""exhibition"" bout for charity, with no belts on the line, they just want to see what will actually happens if the greatest of yesterday fights todays UDC (Dixon holds like 6 or 7 belts in the movie, they look like all the heavyweight belts, plus one that looks like the WWE United States belt, lol).I won't tell the rest, but I recommend this movie, even if you're not a Rocky fan, I think you will enjoy it; it's a great ""neighborhood"" story besides being a pretty good boxing movie.8 out of 10 stars.",Rocky Balboa
312,ninja_superstar-1,Better Late Than Never,8,26 December 2006,"With the first Rocky film, we are introduced to a decidedly American character. A true blue collar hero who inspires the quiet majority is certainly a great accomplishment. Sylvester Stallone merely looks outside at the real world and reflects in his film the squalor and the near-squalor surrounding and pressuring his main character. We watch as he struggles to be the right man for a woman. He struggles with his dreams and feelings of inadequacy, and through it all, we connect with him emotionally and we subsequently celebrate his victories.The second film is essentially a director's extension to the first film, and it continues and concludes much more storyline than Stallone probably intended. Stallone is so complete with the first Rocky movies that the third, fourth, and fifth movies have nowhere believable to begin, and it's painful to watch Stallone brutalize a character that he worked so hard to build.Rocky Balboa is interesting to me because it shows how poor and unnecessary the third, fourth, and fifth Rocky films really are. There's no need for Rocky to overcome the overly racial-ized Clubber Lang in Rocky III, or the Cold War Russian in Rocky IV. By far the worst of the series, Rocky V nearly obliterates everything human about Rocky Balboa, turning him into a selfish jerk; he's always self-centered, but only in Rocky V does he make that unsympathetic turn into selfishness.But with this final chapter, Stallone has attempted to own the mistakes of his Rocky series as well as finally writing a conclusion worthy of the character he created 30 years ago. Yes, the older Rocky lectures to us in clichés and he tells us ""something 'we' already know,"" but he does it in a manner that is believable and insightful within the context of the character. Stallone has rendered a good sense of desperation and pain for his older Rocky. It's likely Stallone himself is going through these very same feelings as he ages and looks back at some mistakes and missteps in his career as well as the moments of greatness.My uncle is 50 years old and in fantastic shape. After seeing the film with his kids, he thought the film didn't have enough action and that it was more about thinking and feeling than the Rocky he knows. His description of the film is accurate, but I'm not sure what else one can expect from Stallone. Stallone is 60 years old and in great, great shape for his age. He gives as good a physical display as possible in this final film, and he does not appear broken or apologetic because of his age. There are few movies out there that actually respect the aging and the elderly. Stallone has found a way.It's also great to see Rocky continue to learn and not settle on old prejudices. This struggle may be even more difficult than the physical challenges of the film. Stallone displays a matured tenderness in a Platonic relationship with a younger woman that I wasn't expecting, and I appreciated the gesture. Stallone seems to have touched on nearly everything in the Rocky world, tying up loose ends, finishing things. Rocky Balboa could easily have been the conclusion to a trilogy, instead of a disclaimer about what Stallone meant to say.In the end, the film works for me. Yes, we could have done without a cameo by Mike Tyson, and Mason ""The Line"" Dixon is a horrid, horrid name. But there's some good stuff here. Despite being sentimental, I actually believed Stallone's older Rocky, mostly because it's clear that Stallone believes what he's saying and doing in this film. Better late than never.",Rocky Balboa
313,fundaquayman,ROCKY's epilogue,6,15 September 2009,"To fans of the first ROCKY, basically anything post ROCKY II didn't need to get made, and all the subsequent sequels only turned the franchise into cheesy affairs -- think Rocky's roar and tight outfits in III & IV, and who could forget Talia Shire's teary-eyed exclamation of, ""You are a champion, Rocky!"" This HOPEFULLY final installment brings closure to the life of Rocky Balboa, and it could have been great - Rocky is way past his prime, and has basically settled, not happily, somewhere between his ambitions and limitations. Life in your autumn years can be lonely when those you love have basically left you behind, and Rocky needs to find a way to assert his own meaning in living. I say that this film COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT because it does contain moments that are compelling. Rocky's rebuttal to his son's lament about having lived his entire life under his father's shadow was the highlight of the film -- nearly as moving as Al Pacino's locker room speech near the end of ANY GIVEN Sunday. There were also scenes that no one would expect to actually work but did -- when Rocky talks to his new found love after Adrian's passing. He brings back all the awkward moments that made him the underdog we loved in the first ROCKY.But that is about all that worked with ROCKY BALBOA.The movie was shot in HD video, and graded film-like, not dissimilar to many TV shows we see today. In fact, so much so that there were moments I thought I was watching either WITHOUT A TRACE or COLD CASE -- the colors and textures, as well as the camera work ALL the same.They could have done better.Typically with any film of this genre, the 2nd act brings out the impossible challenges the protagonist has to overcome, and the 3rd act shows how he triumphs through the odds to victory -- there is basically no 2nd act to ROCKY BALBOA, unless you count the argument he has with his son to be the 2nd act, which doesn't have enough weight to engage the audience to where it is needed. Similarly in the 3rd act, the fight could have been handled much better -- and I kept hoping it would end similarly as THE WRESTLER did. Stallone should have realized that Rocky didn't really have any ambitions, but what came to him -- good or bad, defined him. It is his way of rolling with life's many knocks & pings that made him who he is -- not what he tried to make for himself. After his boxing career was over, the only things that mattered to him in life were his family, and sometimes his pride (which had to be coerced out of him through the likes of Mr. T, and other Rock-em--Sock-em humanoids). If anything else beyond his family had any value to Rocky the simpleton, it was boxing.In Christopher Nolan's THE WRESTLER, Randy ""the Ram"" realized that the only place he belonged was in the ring, and beyond that he had no meaning to his being. As tragic as life is, it carried the film into a great ending.2 years before that, Stallone wouldn't have had the chance to reference a film that hasn't been made yet. but he should have known better than to give us a Disneyland ending.As good as the 1st ROCKY was, that it was so successful not only at the box office and at that following year's Oscar's (it actually took best picture over ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN!), ROCKY became an inspiration for that generation. Grey hooded sweats was all the rage, and kids all over practiced their one-arm push-ups to be like Rocky. The fact that Stallone and John Avildsen (director of ROCKY) took much inspiration from SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME (1950's Oscar winning film starring Paul Newman as Rocky Graciano, and directed by Robert Wise) was never acknowledged or the original given credit to. If you've seen the Paul Newman film, you'll see how even the mannerism and attire Stallone's Rocky were cop...(cough) ""inspired"" by the Robert Wise film.If Stallone had the ability to see a film like THE WRESTLER, and take the same liberties as he did with the Robert Wise film, ROCKY BALBOA may have become a great finale to the franchise.",Rocky Balboa
314,xander34,Surprisingly decent,7,25 December 2006,"Since its announcement, the buzz on Sylvester Stallone's new installment in the Rocky Franchise has gone from painstakingly low, to surprisingly high. Everyone seems to be agreeing that Stallone has redeemed the franchise with a final, enjoyable film, Rocky Balboa. Stallone provides enough meat to the story that Rocky Balboa is easily accessible to old fans of the franchise, as well as viewers seeing their first Rocky film. Yet of course, Stallone throws in nostalgic throwbacks to the previous films.Stallone returns again as a writer and a director to the film. However, his writing reigns supreme over his plain, generally uninteresting direction. The screenplay brings about inspired monologues that somehow feel genuine rather than clichéd, providing the best acting Stallone has given in many years.The first half of the film starts out with a sad, lonely, and somewhat bored Rocky, who recently became a widower. His son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), is too busy trying to escape his father's shadow to care, and the closest friend he has who isn't dead is Paulie, (Burt Young) Rocky's brother-in-law. Rocky spends most of his time sitting by his wife's grave in a lawn chair, or telling stories to his customers at the small restaurant he owns.After seventy or so minutes of really learning about Rocky, and even loving him, Rocky earns his right to fight again. The story is so propelling that the ridiculousness of how Rocky's final fight comes about is left unnoticed. The fight against the current heavyweight champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is executed incredibly, and as always, the audience will root for the underdog.Stallone likes to provoke the emotions of the audience through the use of melodramatic music, underscoring scenes targeted out to be ""powerful."" This can make the scene feel sappy and overly sentimental, rather than sincere and true. Yet scenes like this do gel within the whole film. They don't stick out or make the scene incite unwanted laughter.By the end it becomes apparent that Stallone put everything he had into this final chapter of the Rocky Series, just like Rocky Balboa threw out everything ""in the basement"" in his last fight. . Except for the last seven minutes, it is not an action film, but a dramatic, satisfying character story. However, Stallone didn't take any risks to give his film an edge, something to make it great, rather than good.",Rocky Balboa

The film is written by and directed by Sylvester Stallone. The film also co-stars Tony Burton, Milo Ventimiglia, Geraldine Hughes, and James Francis Kelly III. Pedro Lovell also makes a special guest appearance as Spider Rico, who was Rocky's opponent in the club fight in the original ROCKY (1976). Mike Tyson makes a brief appearance as himself.When he loses a highly publicized virtual boxing match to 2-time former Heavyweight Champion ROCKY BALBOA (Sylvester Stallone), reigning heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) retaliates by challenging the Italian Stallion to a nationally-televised, 10-round exhibition bout. To the surprise of his son (Milo Ventimiglia) and friends, Rocky agrees to come out of retirement and face an opponent who's faster, stronger, and thirty years his junior. With the odds stacked firmly against him, Rocky takes on Dixon in what will become the greatest fight in boxing history, a hard-hitting, action-packed battle of the ages!ROCKY BALBOA features once again the phenomenal music score by Bill Conti who composed the music for the original ROCKY (1976), ROCKY II (1979), ROCKY III (1982), and ROCKY V (1990). This is the last film in the franchise that Stallone directed. ROCKY BALBOA had a budget of $24,000,000. The film grossed $155,000,000 worldwide, making it a great success financially. Overall, with phenomenal music, drama, acting, and the most realistic boxing fight out of the entire franchise, ROCKY BALBOA (2006) gives the franchise justice and marks the end of the series with a classic bang that'll have you cheering for Rocky once more in the final fight of his life. 9/10. Highly recommended.",Rocky Balboa
316,Squeele,The final round of the greatest hero in the history of Cinema.,9,9 June 2007,"Let's face it, last time we met him, Balboa was in bad shape. And so was Sly. Now, 16 years later, what could we expect from a last chapter of Rocky's story? The answer is: the best. Not the best the character had to offer, like in the first two movies. But the very best of Stallone's writing and direction. It may not mean that much to some cynical haters, or to those who grew disappointed by Sly's movies in the past decades. But let's never forget that Stallone created the most heroic, famous, inspiring hero of our time. How many careers in sports or arts were inspired and fueled by this tale of iron will and search for happiness?You may think it's only ""make-believe"", that it's sometimes forced, or awkward. It's not totally false, but not totally true either. And it doesn't matter, it's the way Sylvester Stallone does his stuff. It's got Heart. It's somewhat hamfisted. It's Rocky. Coming out of retirement for one last fight. To win back his fans, both in the movie's and the real world.After the death of his wife Adrian, a 50-something Rocky learnt to live alone again, recounting his fights to the patrons of his restaurant. Unsatisfied by his new life, he stays in shape and regularly tours his old spots with his brother-in-law Paulie (the criminally underrated Burt Young) in order to keep the past alive. But his biggest regret is his son Robert Jr (Milo Ventimiglia) who stays as far from his old father as he can, upset by his father's old glory and the side-effects it has on his life. Incapable to understand his son's grief and lack of self-esteem, Rocky tries to revive his boxing career in small, local events in order to win back the admiration and love of his son, and show him the way to fulfill his dreams. With the help of Marie (Geraldine Hughes, a great addition to the series) Rocky will face an astounding challenge when the actual Heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (real-life boxer Antonio Tarver, whose acting skills are surprisingly strong) wants to challenge him in an exhibition fight, in order to prove his detractors he's made of the stuff of the old champions...Forget the age, forget the previous mediocre films. Rocky scores big time in this wonderful little movie. It's definitely not a masterpiece like the first one, but it's a touching, flawed, sincere attempt from an almost washed-up boxer (and actor) to shine one last time.And above all, its the occasion for an artist to show his gratitude to the people around the world who made him what he is today. Rocky owed his fans a great final fight as well as Sly owed us a great finale.Yo Sly. You DID it. Thank you.",Rocky Balboa
317,Minstrelman,Best Stallone film in a while,9,18 June 2008,"Pleasantly surprised! Of course, Rocky is one of the great characters of American cinema, so it's always heartwarming to see him on screen. But this is definitely one of the best films of the series and a good capper to the story.When I first heard about this film, I had visions of the joke from Airplane II (you know, the poster in the airport of Rocky XXXIII). But I loved this movie! It's at least as good as Rocky II and almost as good as the original. Burt Young is great as usual and Stallone gives his best performance in a while.This one is worth the time. It's warm, entertaining, and flows well. All together now... ROCKY!! ROCKY!! ROCKY!!",Rocky Balboa
318,bamatommy,You Won't be Disappointed,9,1 January 2007,"If you liked the previous Rocky movies, you will love this one. It's the best Rocky movie since Rocky II. Sylvester Stallone knows how to pull on your heart strings, and he does it several times in this movie. One of the most moving scenes was when he was talking to Paulie at the meat processing plant, and he talked about having ""stuff in the basement"", that is, unfinished business.I really liked the lady who played Marie (Geraldine Hughes). She was a very lovable and believable character.One final thought: I hope they don't make any more Rocky films. This one was really good, and it will be hard to top. And Stallone is about 60 years old. That's why they don't need to make another one.He doesn't need to make a movie about him helping a younger boxer, because this is what he did in Rocky V and it wasn't very good. Rocky needs to be retired. I feel the same way about Austin Powers. You can go one too many times to the well, and if they make any more Rocky films, that's what would happen.",Rocky Balboa
319,mewmewmint-1,Exciting!,8,13 September 2007,"The build up in this movie has got to be the most exciting of the Rocky movies... the ending, however, is a huge let down. I won't go into it further than that for those of you who ignored the spoiler warning... those that have seen it probably know what I'm talking about.If the ending were different than this would be one of the greatest movies of all time. As it is, it still is a great picture, as are the rest of the Rocky films.I watched this the same week as a watched DOA... and it really made me realize how stupid those cheesy fake martial arts and hot babe with stories based on a video game movies are. Hollywood tries so hard just to be cool, with fake ninja fighting and techno music, but they really fail at making characters that aren't one dimensional. None of those crap movies will get your adrenaline pumping like this does! When Rocky gets ready to fight you really want the guy to win.What this movie was missing: in the previous Rocky movies there was always a flurry of blows that just looked devastating... when Rocky gets mad. They could have made one of his flurries about 5 times longer and this film really would have rocked. They had the flashbacks, which were nice, but doesn't make up for what this fight lacks. Also, the fight seemed too short. They showed the first couple rounds, then they flew through like 10 rounds in a few seconds and showed the final round.",Rocky Balboa
320,shanfan_14,Wonderful!,10,22 December 2006,"Rocky has always been a very special, emotionally engaging character to me and my clan. We were understandably disappointed at the travesty that was V and equally understandably skeptical, in light of that, when a sixth movie was announced. Would we still see it? Of course. Did we expect much? Well, we were reserved in our enthusiasm.Still, the critics (who hate everything real people like, it seems) were remarkably positive, to our delight. A Wednesday opening that was sold out for all showings in all theaters was even better.Last night we were so happy to see the wonderful conclusion that was Rocky Balboa. What a great way to tie in the high points of the saga. Although I was really impressed with the way the boxing was handled, my first remark to my kids was ""What a beautiful story!"" And so it was.Despite lapses in judgement about story lines in the past, can anyone not care about this man? One of the truly iconic American movie characters, with every wart, every brain blip showing, Balboa grabs the heart, no matter what else is going on. This was far more a real-people movie, with the pain of aging, loss, estrangement, the need to find closure.Loved it, loved it, loved it.",Rocky Balboa
321,i_know_i_die,A very powerful movie.,10,1 January 2007,"I'm not really into sports movies and I have to admit that I haven't seen much of the Rocky series. But one good thing about sports movies is that they always teach us something good. And this movie is a good example. My favorite scene has to be the one where Rocky talk to his son about life. The boxing scene is great. It'll get you to the edge of your seats. It's a great life lesson. Very few movies like this come by nowadays. Truly one of the best sports movie of the year. If you never seen any of the Rocky series (like me), you should check this out. If you been push around by people, you should also check this out. For whatever reasons, this is a MUST watch movie.",Rocky Balboa
322,GenXer,An overrated and unnecessary entry into the Rocky saga,5,30 December 2006,"This movie was expected to suck. It doesn't. And that seems to have sent critics into a state of euphoria.There is nothing in this film that is original enough to justify the artistic effort. In other words, this movie was made a) for commercial reasons, and b) perhaps to allow Stallone one last chance at a victory lap before hanging his spurs (gloves) for good. Knowing that Rambo is about to get the same treatment, I am inclined to think that both reasons are at play.The original Rocky was a complete and self-contained movie. There were no real loose ends. The message was delivered in the most beautiful and satisfying way. But there was great money to be made by creating a franchise, based on the characters of the film, that would appeal to the basest and lowest common denominator of the audience. The center-piece of the attraction became the violence and the vengeance, and sequel after sequel kept dwelling on the visceral side of resolving personal issues, friend/family honor, and world peace, by settling the score in the ring. This had NOTHING to do with the original premise of Rocky, but it sure made a lot of people very rich.Now Rocky Balboa is back with a bevy of recycled material from the first five films sewn together in a shiny quilt, and with Adrian's death thrown in to heighten the emotional effect which Stallone and Co. shrewdly recognized would be too low otherwise. It is a pretentious sermon that has nothing to offer that has not already been presented in a more dignified and artistically viable format.If you loved the heart and inspirational message of the original Rocky, then this movie is nothing but an inferior remake. If you liked the kick-butt fight scenes of the sequels, this movie does not even come close to that level of intensity. If you are not familiar with the Rocky saga, or if your expectations have been lowered in the past 16 years, you'll have an OK time.At any rate, this movie is not necessary. Just watch the original Rocky again and you might wonder why there was ever a Rocky II.",Rocky Balboa
323,loccomotive2000,Best of the series,10,13 September 2007,"Let's just say that I'm an old man trapped in a youngster's body. Let's just say that the 21st century setting was more identifiable with me. But...as much as I love the first movie, I'd have to say Rocky Balboa has truly triumphed over the original.It's been thirty years since Rocko went the distance with world heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, and things have changed a lot. He's lost his wife to cancer, losing his son who's tired of living in his father's shadow, and the boxing world, softened over the years, is slowly being killed by an unbeatable but disillusioned champion. In an attempt to find a new purpose in life, Balboa steps back into the ring, only to be given a surprising opportunity to contend for the heavyweight title, and become the underdog once more.It's nice to see how Balboa mirrors the original Rocky, complete with the build up to the fight and the training montages. Only this time, Rocky is facing mid-life crisis. What was originally seen as a joke in and outside the movie, of a 60-year-old lifting weights and getting back into the ring, turns out to be a truly inspirational and emotional process, and an incredible feat of physicality. Stallone's beefed up build and structured abs leaves everyone in the audience in awe.Cruel as it seems, but one of Sly's masterstrokes was killing off Adrian, Rocky's pillar of strength since the first movie. We see Rocko alone and isolated once more, losing directions in life...just as the first time we've seen him in the original. There's also a nice subplot of Rocky's reunion with lil' Marie, making connections with his past beyond boxing.After a lackluster conclusion with Rocky V, the greatest underdog of all time returns to set things right, and boy was this a worthy comeback. A fitting end to one of the most iconic film series of American cinema.",Rocky Balboa
324,henry_yan,An emotional and fitting end of an icon from an innocent era,9,10 June 2011,"Just saw this movie for the first time on local television, and it ranks on par with the original ""Rocky"" of 1976. I was only 6 when the original came out, and saw it too on local television, but didn't understand the movie's underdog theme until years later. This movie had that same resonance. Not only that, watching the movie as it unfolds, it also adds (personally for myself) another layer of angst, particularly of older Gen-Xers like myself, who are increasingly being marginalised at the workplace by the rash, brash and trash Gen-Yers represented by Dixon ""The Line"" Mason in the movie. Seeing an older guy like Rocky giving the younger man as good as he can give, and more, gave me enormous satisfaction, albeit, only for two hours. Still, it feels good to know that some us oldies still have ""it"" when the need arises. This is an emotional and fitting send-off for an icon from a bygone era, an era where respect actually means something.",Rocky Balboa
325,strtmanadammac,This Rocky movies are finally good again,10,18 December 2006,"I have seen all five preceders and I can say the first two were probably the best; then the carefully planned story lines hit a bump. Rocky 3,4, and 5 were shocking. But once I saw this one, I was amazed at how interesting it was. The acting was marvelous, the plot was the best one yet, although some fights looked unreal it was still a top notch movie.The only real problem there was with this film was the ending. I am not going to blurt it out but it just needing a bit polishing and it I would have given it a perfect 10.9/10 If you enjoyed the First two Rocky movies you'll enjoy this one. Don't miss out.",Rocky Balboa
326,m0ds,Rocky wins again,10,18 March 2007,"Rocky Balboa is a splendid film, presumably the finale to the entire series. It has only been in recent years that I've come to particularly appreciate the Rocky films - but without a doubt, Rocky Balboa is a true success story of just how superb sequels are when their original writers and directors are on board.Stallone brings out all of the old emotions with a limited array of effects, which work nicely. There is nothing over the top about this film. It's very down to earth & although it's cheesy in places - that I believe is exactly what you'd expect from a Rocky movie if you truly enjoy them.Paulie is back and he is the same as ever, which is wonderful, and Rocky's restaurant is such a lovely touch to the film. All the way through I was waiting for the cheesy flash-back of his original trainer, Mickey - but was pleasantly surprised with the way he re-appeared in this film. Seeing Adrian as Rocky once saw her was another beautiful touch.All in all, hats off to Sylvester. This movie really touched me!",Rocky Balboa
327,rawkidd,"And now, what's it all about ?",5,28 December 2006,"As a fan of the Rocky series i really was very excited when I went to the theatre to watch the Italian Stallion. So the first quarter of the movie let's us know that his beloved wife has died of cancer and he somehow tries to manage his emotional life and little restaurant business. Although in the end of Rocky V, when Balboa wins back his son we've been told in the new movie that after Adrian's death Rocky and his son split up again. Rocky junior can't handle his father's popularity which is still unbroken.The boxing-sports part in the movie is really far fetched and lame. The current world champion is being hated by the crowd and his managers try to get him sympathies back and make money with a folk-hero, who is thinking about doing a last last last fight. And because a software says ""that'll be great if the Italian Stallion would fight the Lion"". Come on, we're talking about the really last Rocky movie. There must be more than this.Of course, brave and strong as always, Rocky does well, although he's around 50 in the movie, and....what ? I mean, he loses the fight by 1 or two points and bids the crowd farewell. Good. But what does this movie tell us really ? I DON'T KNOW.There are some interesting scenes, like when Rocky meets little Marie and the get good friends and also there is a good dispute between Rocky and his junior but that's it. There is nothing more.The boxing scenes are boring and it almost looks ridiculous how Rocky or Sly looks. I really hoped that this last one, which is not called Rocky 6, no it is wearing that great boxers name Rocky Balboa would be the final firework of Rocky's amazing life and career.I really was disappointed when I left the theatre and had to agree to what a lot of critics said up front. But at least there is good news. It is not worse than Rocky 5, which was a disaster in my eyes.",Rocky Balboa
328,finitodistampare,This is an excellent movie,10,13 August 2007,"The last chapter of Rocky Balboa in film is an excellent movie .The screenplay presents characters of flesh and blood and the situations are believable. Actually I watch the the movie on DVD and I love it. This movie went straight to number 1 in the Spain box office .A total smash hit in the country and I think that it is deserved. Stallone have made a movie with soul and have fine scenes as an actor and the cast is very well made .One thing that I like in this movie is that it is coherent , the screenplay is intelligent and the scenes flow with logic. This movie truly recaptures the spirit of the first Rocky and it's a great final chapter to the series.",Rocky Balboa
329,Bandit1974,Growing Old Gracefully,10,22 December 2006,"I must say that it would appear that enough time has passed between Rocky Balboa and the last installment, Rocky V, that perhaps it afforded Stallone the opportunity to get in touch with what the original movie was really about.He's written a fantastic movie.In doing so he has also introduced us to a different side of the character he plays so well. Rocky was always a family man and always valued the truly important things in life. That theme was always obvious throughout the series. In Rocky Balboa Stallone plays the character exactly as I had hoped he would when I walked into the theater. Rocky is a man who was never terribly bright and often came off looking like a dufus. In Rocky Balboa we see a man who has been educated by life. He tries to keep things simple and understands that family and friends are the most important things in life. We also see that Rocky is a respected and truly adored man in his community.Aside from the first Rocky, this was probably the most sentimental to watch. This being the sixth installment in the series, the character Rocky Balboa is truly a part of many people's lives who grew up when I did (I'm 32).I know that this review hasn't said much about the movie itself. If you've seen the trailers you should have a good understanding of what to expect from the movie. It was a real treat for me to watch Stallone play the character that many of us have grown up with since we were kids. He did not disappoint or disrespect the legacy of the original movie. I've read several reviews that have stated that Rocky Balboa makes up for the mess of Rocky V. I would agree, and then some.Congratulations and thank you, Sly.",Rocky Balboa
330,liamkellybusiness,A pleasant surprise.,7,6 May 2020,"This film is better than Rocky III, IV and V in my opinion. Just from a filmmaking standpoint this film easily beats IV and V and just edges out III for me. The performances are much more believable and the direction takes centre stage as one of the best in the series. Easily the best in the franchise since Rocky II in my opinion. Stallone is at his best here and very motivational the whole way through. Very entertaining!",Rocky Balboa
331,PatoRonald,Rocky's return was good,6,21 November 2020,"With a beautiful plot, a beautiful narrative, ""Rocky Balboa"" or ""Rocky VI"" manages to deliver a film that not only makes several references to the classics of the Rocky franchise, but also carries much of the essence of Rocky's first film, focused a little more in the dramatization, Rocky VI manages to be good at everything, except in the main, in the fight, even if Rocky returns to the ring, I didn't feel any realism coming from his blows, much less from the opponent, the camera positions didn't help much either The fight is also full of flashbacks, punches without a will, it doesn't look like a cinematic fight, not even a real fight. These were exactly the thoughts that crossed my mind when watching that, even O SOCO, which when it came, reached the soul, was chilling.Rocky VI, despite making many mistakes in his main role, still managed to deliver a rewarding result, nothing so good, but it is good enough.",Rocky Balboa
332,jimanuel12,This one is as good as the Original!!!!!!,8,16 July 2014,"When this movie first came out - i said ""you have got to be kidding me - another Rocky movie?"" But man, i was surprised, i did not watch this movie until recently and i was blown away. I think this is the best Rocky movie since Rocky III if not better. It shows that Rocky had the heart of a lion, no fear, and was still a damn good boxer for his age. It also has some really good scenes about Rocky dealing with the death of his wife (Adrienne). It shows that the new heavy weight champ does not have the heart of Rocky, is too consumed with his own self and learns from fighting Rocky what is means to be a true champion. So the movie has allot of good qualities and values. It also shows that Rocky really loved Adrienne and how much he misses her and shows the love between them. Pauly is as goofy as usual and adds to the old original theme. It is well worth your time to see this movie - it was really a good one.",Rocky Balboa
333,tsakiridis1217,Rocky For Life,10,26 March 2015,"Rocky Balboa is not a movie for everyone, it's a mature and grown-up movie. This picture crosses the line from a simple boxing adrenaline film and becomes a psychological, incredibly-moving drama. I keep listening to people saying this film is ""so sad"" and ""dark"". Well, that's the point. This is my favorite installment in the franchise. I know most people watch the first three and jump up and down with the training and the running sequences but this one has something different. We get to see an older Rocky in a depiction that gains our attention. This is a once glorious man whose world has now fallen apart. His wife is gone, and the people who cared about him cannot stand next to him the way they used to. His way of life has changed and across time, he seems to have accepted the loss of his courage and any thought for attempting to reclaim his pride back has faded. He is sad and at the same time mad... when silent, seems unintentionally loud... his words are meant to be hopeful and yet sound desperate... trying to keep his world optimistic, even though he knows nothing is going the way he wanted to. But through a series of events, that small itch is now coming back. Everything is black but it doesn't have to be. He decides to go back to the ring for one last time. Apparently that's not okay with his son, who can't let go of his name and its impact. Around that time, we are drawn in Rocky's way of thinking and his struggle against the system and the people who stand in his way. Along the way we find out more than ever about his inner sides and his deeper feelings. Rocky is fully unwrapped and the last fight comes to show the determination, of this old legend, coming back to life for one last time.It is safe to say that this is the best performance of Silvester Stallone and for sure his best script. For me, both Oscar- worthy and undermined. His speeches (sometimes under-appreciated) are so truthful and captivating (drawn as he has admitted from his real life), that I don't see how they didn't get more recognition. Best choice in the world for Mr. Stallone to leave Talia Shire out of this movie. It achieved the emotional impact needed for Rocky and his return and prevail. That was the basic move for the general mood he wanted to be set. And even though I really don't think he is a good actor, Milo Ventimiglia is catching the spirit of his role as Rocky's son.When I watch this film, one word comes to mind: Nostalgia. The climate, the colors, the pace... it's all so withered and silent. Watching this movie is not happy-time and no picnic. But at times I catch myself wishing there were more of these types of films... where the struggle and endeavor of one man is shown with actual honesty within a world that ""ain't all sunshine and rainbows"". This is a thoughtful, noir picture, full of emotions and implied meanings for life. And its worth a whole lot more attention than what has gotten.",Rocky Balboa
334,galaxywest,Comment about movie Father Sons,9,31 January 2010,"Why is it that in the movies so many adult sons are shorter than their ""star"" fathers? Usually sons are taller than their fathers -- not always, but usually. In Indiana Jones 4 Harrison Ford was way taller than his son -- who was supposed to be a young adult. Why? Is it that directors or whoever think that the audience can't psychologically handle a son taller than a father. In Rocky Balboa, it is the same thing. Rocky's adult kid is about an inch shorter than pretty short S. Stallone. Come on, the kid grew up rich and Adrian fed him better than Rocky got fed as a kid. The IMDb just said I have to type some more. The good thing, otherwise, about Rocky Balboa, is the casting and overall demeanor of the film. It wasn't full of 'beautiful' people. The model-actors that fill up the TV tube these days.",Rocky Balboa
335,jagooch,Loved It,8,24 December 2006,"I just finished watched this wonderful movie, and recommend that other go see it. Its a mix of the past and the present, well-balanced and thoughtfully written so that the story moves along well while tugging at your heart. As others have pointed out, the Rocky series started losing heart at the third film, with the 5th one a feeble attempt to regain lost ground.This film success recaptures the spirit of the first, and gets and keep the audience caring about what is going to happen next. All the way up until the end, you will wonder how things are going to turn out, a feat often attempted but rarely achieved by filmmakers.While I am more geared to fast-pace, beat everyone up action movies like the Matrix, I am sure periodically view this film in the future.",Rocky Balboa
336,alexis_240,"""The last thing to age on someone is their heart""",10,26 January 2007,"A struggling actor who, as he said, ""also writes"", a low budget production and a great performance by Stallone were the ingredients that brought the first Rocky to the screen. Now the reason why I believe Stallone is so closely associated with Rocky is not just because he acted the character out so brilliantly but because he created him. There is much of sly in Rocky e.g. he said that he decided to add a pet shop to the first film in order to introduce the theme of pets seeking a new beginning, which is what he was trying to do with the movie. Plus there is a line in Rocky Balboa ""I'd rather do something Ilove badly than feeling bad about not doing something that I love"" which sly added to the script after his wife, so he says,begged him not to do another Rocky film. It kinda shows how much he loves the character and how much we adore Rocky.People go on and on about the Rocky franchise being overstretched into 5 parts, calling the 5th one pitiful. I say you are wrong, I personally love every single Rocky sequel, obviously including this one, plus I can't see any pitifulness in the 5th Rocky. It's a film about father and son and about Rocky wanting to retire and take up Mickey's role as a fighting coach, in order to pass his talent on to the next generation.It's a fighter's life that we witness through the Rocky pictures, and the 5th one demonstrates the point Sly made in Balboa ""Life is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take"" He's lost his money but not his courage, he gladly agrees to help Tommy Gunn train.Rocky Balboa, as Sly himself said, speaks against the commonly held view of life ending at 50 and actors being made fun of for reprising roles they played when they were a lot younger e.g. Harrison Ford in the upcoming Indy film. It's about wanting to go out in style or have a last stand at something you were once great at, fighting in Rocky's case.Except that, the first few nostalgia sequences echo Sly's own nostalgia of the character. He once said that hardly a day goes by that he does not miss playing Rocky. Another great personal addition to the film therefore.Overall Balboa is great comeback for a character that will live not only in movie history but also in our hearts and our memories forever. So let us all bid a bond farewell to someone who would not have come back if it wasn't for Sly's ""stuff in the basement"".",Rocky Balboa
337,ecko_47,'Rocky' Hits the mat,4,21 December 2006,"There's a telling moment in ""Rocky,"" the 1976 crowd-pleasing, Oscar-winner that launched the career of Sylvester Stallone.In it, Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia club fighter who's been given an unlikely chance to fight heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, wanders into the arena the night before the bout and glances up at a huge banner of himself hanging over the ring. Compared to that gigantic image, Rocky is a credibly small and human figure, a man thrust into something far bigger than he can comprehend.In the four sequels that appeared over the next 14 years, Rocky and the fellow who created and played him came more and more to resemble the steroidal cartoon on that banner and less and less to feel like flesh-and-blood people. The formula was always the same -- hokey melodrama leading up to a big, grueling fight -- but the reality had been bled from the enterprise. Rocky became a joke and a bore.Now an additional 16 years have passed, and Stallone, whose career has been something of a rumor since 1997's estimable ""Cop Land,"" has chosen to don once again the mashed-up hat and mashed-up mouth for ""Rocky Balboa,"" which we're promised is the old pug's last outing. While Stallone likely hopes to go out with a bang, this small, manipulative movie doesn't have any real punch to it. Yes, when Rocky finally gets into the ring, he provides a few visceral thrills. But so little rings true or real about the picture that you feel a bit suckered, as if you bought an expensive pay-per-view boxing package and wound up watching a first-round knockout.The textures of ""Rocky Balboa"" are redolent of the first film in the series. We join the former champ one wintry morning (it's always winter in ""Rocky"" movies) in his gloomy South Philly row house as he's preparing for the glum duty of commemorating the anniversary of the death of his wife, Adrian, by driving with his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young) to visit the places where he met and wooed her.He's a sad case, banging around the old neighborhood in search of traces of past happiness, sitting mutely in a folding chair at Adrian's grave site; telling tired tales of the ring in an ill-fitting jacket at his restaurant (named Adrian's); reaching vainly out to Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), who, smothered by his famous father's shadow, works in the financial world and rarely visits home.After we've been peppered with an overload of reminders of (and clips from) the previous films, an absurd series of contrivances arises.A TV boxing show uses a computer simulation to see how Rocky would fare against the current champ, the invincible (and idiotically named) Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (played by former light heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver).The ensuing hubbub inspires Rocky to apply for a boxing license, just to engage in a few club fights. Tarver's managers, recognizing that their fighter is waning in popularity, go further, reckoning that an exhibition between their guy and Rocky -- with proceeds going to charity -- could boost the champ's image. Despite the protests of Rocky Jr., the Pennsylvania boxing commission, TV boxing experts, barroom loudmouths, and Marie (Geraldine Hughes), his mousy new not-quite-girlfriend, Rocky steps up to face what looks like certain doom.Cue the training montage.Cue the big fight.In all three of his capacities here -- writer, director, star -- Stallone is wobbly. The script has a grinding quality: Again and again, somebody decides not to do something or to tell Rocky 'no,' and Rocky makes a long speech about inner character and heart and grit, and all is well again. The rest of the cast seems in place merely to give Rocky obstacles to overcome, particularly Tarver, whose Dixon has none of the menace or charisma of Rocky's previous foes.Visually, the first half of the picture depends too heavily on flashbacks, while the fight scenes are diluted by hokey effects (including black-and-white-with-color trickery stolen from ""Sin City""). Speaking of visuals, Stallone himself is a bit of a shock, his face a porcelain landscape of plastic surgery don'ts, his body saggy despite its evident strength. (Yes, I hope I look as fit at 60, but I also hope to have the wisdom to keep my shirt on when there's a movie camera running nearby.) ""Rocky Balboa"" isn't a catastrophe. Some of its rue and nostalgia seems genuine, perhaps a reflection of the vagaries of Stallone's own career. But the chief thing it's got going for it is its connection to past glories and emotions. Inadvertently, it proves that you truly can't go home again -- not even if you never left home in the first place.",Rocky Balboa
338,brentsoffcenter,"Less glamor, and more human drama",8,30 December 2006,"As in other comments you've read here, any Stallone fan will appreciate this latest effort. And by rights, any ""non-Stallone"" fan should appreciate this movie as well. While in past efforts Sylvester has been appreciated inconsistently by the movie going public, he should be recognized as an accomplished artist. This film should prove, once and for all, the highly artistic, sensitive, and skillful artist that Stallone is. His writing, directing, and acting are all superb. Did I mention athleticism? For a man of 60 to be a believable contender for a world boxing championship is a feat of accomplishment in itself, and Stallone delivers this believability absolutely one hundred percent. It goes without saying that he is in better physical condition than ninety percent of the rest of the world, young, prime, or older.In order to lend some level of credibility to the above statements, it would also be wise to balance this critique with a few other observations. In terms of the film being a human drama, it was nearly flawless. Rocky, the character, unable to come to grips with his wife's passing of four years ago, tends to be somewhat detached from the rest of society. His son, for example, has handled his mother's passing much better than he (Rocky) has. This portion of the script verges on the melodramatic, and yet is almost consistent with Rocky's personality. Mason Dixon is believable, also, and adds credibility to an otherwise slightly contrived set of circumstances.A close look at the actual boxing is an important part of this film, in that it shows the reality of age and experience versus youth and speed. For those who actually do understand the physical challenges and limitations age places on one, it is not difficult to pick out some of the speed editing or punching synchronization loopholes. It is also not impossible to see that, although still quick, coordinated, and strong, Rocky's age does not permit him to out box the champion. Not only does Rocky not out box the champion, there are some sequences in which he looks slow, out of focus, and missing the mark strictly because of the age thing. Although Rocky Balboa does pull off the believability of the match itself, it is hard to fathom this type of thing happening in real life.Also, for the benefit of the real profession of boxing, it should be pointed out that no amount of weight training, heavy bag training, speed bag training, and road work can make a complete training package. It was not shown anywhere in the story, where Rocky had any local bouts or practice sparring before the main event. The script would almost have us believe that Rocky, for all of his super human ability, walked into the ring for the main event in Las Vegas, on championship night, right out of the kitchen. George Forman, Joe Frazier, and Muhammed Ali might find that scenario to be showing just a little bit of wishful thinking. Never the less, Rocky somehow manages to pull it off, and make it believable.Anyone interested in a good human drama with sentimentality and emotion should see this movie. Anyone who is interested in real boxing should also see this movie, but just not be too overly critical.",Rocky Balboa
339,TwentyCalls,Another same Rocky movie,4,24 April 2007,"As I was watching this movie, I was wondering if Sylvester Stallone was propagating himself. Was he going to run for Major or what? He was in the movie giving all kind of life lessons. There was nothing original or special about this sequel as compared to the rest. Furthermore, I could not feel the inspiration that I felt in the first or even the second sequel. It was the same story retold again and again. This movie was a waste of energy and time. I remembered in the slapstick comedy, there was a poster that showed ""Rocky XXXVI"", I hoped it would not come to that. Nevertheless, I do admire Stallone's physic at his age. Acting OK and so were the rest of the crews. Overall, I give it a 4/10.",Rocky Balboa
340,pkhall1,Thank You Sylvester Stallone!!!!!,9,2 January 2007,"I hope Mr. Stallone visits these boards....There is something I'd like to tell him.I have never felt inspired to comment on a movie here before but after seeing Rocky Balboa I just couldn't let this opportunity pass. I know that I must have watched Rocky over 200 times over the last 30 years and seriously, although I am a fan of the series and always stop on the channel that any of the Rocky I-V movies are being shown on TV, I cannot tell you fellow IMDb members/visitors just how blown away I and my whole family was after seeing this masterpiece of writing/directing/acting. No one was expecting what we saw. The movie critics are mixed with their opinions, and after Rocky V, I think just about everyone was nervous when Mr. Stallone announced another installment was to come. I remember when film legend Kirk Douglas was speaking at the Academy Award Show several years ago he gave Mr. Stallone a bit of a jab at how movie making was more than about money and how he had advised Mr. Stallone to try to find deeper vehicles for his abilities and talent. Well I would imagine that Mr. Douglas would be pleased to give Mr Stallone a call if he sees this film! I found myself along with hundreds of others covered in tears literally 5 minutes into the movie and probably 4 times later in the movie. I couldn't believe the emotional impact on over 90% of those in the sold out theater I was in and as for the other 10% of those in there as you all know there are those that go to the movies and visit these boards that we all would love to just banish forever due to immaturity and stupidity. Sylvester Stallone simply had everyone in the theater in the palm of his hand and treated everyone there with a look into his soul. This was his baby in 1976---that over the years many in Hollywood eventually put his or her opinions and effort into which helped make Sly one of the biggest stars on the planet......undeniable style witnessed by all but often with questionable substance.....until now when he took over the reigns again and from start to finish placed his indelible fingerprint on one of the finest pieces of movie-making since Schindler's List. If you loved Million Dollar Baby, and many did, this will reach deeper. If you are a Rocky fan this will cut through your heart to your soul. I hope when Oscar nods are handed out the members of the Academy don't punish Sly for the commercialism and $$$$$$$ from years of the past but realize that the magic that happened 30 years ago which garnered a best screen writing Oscar and best picture for Mr Stallone and all involved, has somehow found its way to our lucky selves through an unbelievable effort by this very very gifted movie maker/writer/actor.Thank you Sly and I wish I could shake your hand for both my and my family's favorite movie-going experience we have had for many many years.",Rocky Balboa

Then 15 yrs later you take the same guy, and franchise, and comeback in the underdog story of the year, and you blow our minds with this movie. Leaving us wanting more. That's Rocky Balboa in a nut shell. Sylvester was seen as a guy grasping for one last go at the spotlight. Same with Rocky. The outcome was proof neither are jokes! and both deserve the attention they get. Im not sure it's cool to cry in a manly movie, but I'll tell ya, there sure are a couple parts where I had to start the nervous laugh so my eyes didn't water like a baby. We even got a ' yo Adriane ' I knew this movie would be amazing when I saw Stallone graciously taking his ridicule, and what were you thinking making another one. It would be a shame for anyone to not see this, because they think it was a money making ploy. I mean do people really think he would take this legacy and lay it out so people could laugh at him? He deserves such a great deal of respect as an actor, director, writer, and franchise pin cushin. They once said the Beatles were dead when they took a year to release a goofy titled LP called Sgt. Pepper. However as we all know now, it was the total opposite. Thats what Rocky Balboa is. It's Stallone's (wink, and I told ya so) movie. He may have been over exposed in the 80's, but he deserves a lot more credit then he has ever been given! Rocky 4 made me sign up to learn how to box, and I felt the same energy when this movie ended. If you don't see it, you'll miss out, on a true ending to the greatest underdog franchise EVER!!!

342,john-quel,Almost a Technical Knockout,8,23 December 2006,"To get it over with, ""Rocky Balboa"" works. Having been old enough to see the first one when it came out (29 years ago!), I find this a very good film to conclude the series. There is so much humanity on display in the movie. As I was watching. I kept wondering (and hoping): could a Rocky movie be done without a fight sequence? There are enough stories going on here, one of the film's disappointments is that many of the characters and their stories needed to be rounded out and deepened (which is why I am giving it an ""8""). It could have been significantly longer to do them justice. But of course, there is a fight sequence, further proof as if any is needed that I will never be a big studio executive. So while I think the film works best outside of the ring, nevertheless, the fantasy of the Great White Dope (and I mean that with utmost affection) continues to resonate powerfully. The guy takes fantastic punishment and just won't give up, a metaphor which unquestionably endears him to a much larger segment of the population than fight fans.How well will it do? Early box office returns indicate that the film will do well, not great however, and nowhere near the original, but well enough. Everyone will be happy (except for a few disgruntled film critics) that the movie was made. And those who love the series will get to see it go out in style.",Rocky Balboa
343,chrisward46,An emotional trip and a fitting end.,9,20 January 2007,"Had the privilege of watching this movie on the opening night, and having been a lifelong fan of Rocky and Boxing, did not leave disappointed.This movie is certainly a lot closer in style and execution to the first two movies in a way that didn't seem as deliberate as Rocky V did. Ignoring the politics of part 4 and the contrived part 5, this is Rocky (the character) back to basics - speaking from the heart, looking out for others, and always ready with a humorous remark but also with a sense of wisdom and sadness that only age and experience can bring (the speech he gives to his son when he is trying to justify fighting again should give Stallone an Oscar nomination - it certainly gave me a lump in my throat).One of the things that makes this movie work so well is not having the character of Adrian, who has died of ovarian cancer. It is this element that brings Rocky back down to the level he was at when we first met him, and with all the other characters in the film, I guess there wouldn't have been much room for her. It is his grief for her passing that gives him the vulnerable quality he shows throughout.As usual, Rocky is backed up by his best friend Paulie (I watched the first Rocky the other day - did Burt Young ever look young?) who, unlike Rocky, doesn't spend his time looking into the past and on the one occasion he does, he also offers a glimpse into a side of his character we haven't seen before.Other characters from previous films show up - Duke (just how old is Tony Burton?), Marie (who gives Rocky a sense of being needed, without being romantic) and Spider Rico (the very first boxer Rocky fights in the first film) - which gives the film a sense of nostalgia without resorting to the obvious, a la Rocky V. Mickey (his original trainer) is mentioned and given the briefest of flashbacks, as is Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. Apollo Creed is mentioned but not shown (apparently due to Carl Weathers not being paid enough - there's loyalty) and there is no mention of Tommy Gunn.Antonio Tarver appears as Rocky's opponent Mason Dixon who, like Apollo Creed, isn't exactly a bad guy but has his own reasons for taking on someone of Balboa's caliber. This is a champ who makes all the right moves and beats everybody but doesn't win the respect of the fans and can't understand why (who says the Rocky films aren't realistic? Audley Harrison, anybody?).The main strength of the film is the fact that the characters on screen are the same characters who we saw on screen thirty years ago, and there is a feeling of having lived their life with them. Usually when a film involves flashbacks and suchlike, we have actors covered in make-up to make them look young/old, or whatever is required. But here we don't need that. We have thirty years of footage to draw back on, and it is this that allows us to enter Rocky's world one last time and get as emotionally involved with the characters as we would if we were looking back at our own old home movies.The only thing that would have made this slightly better, for me anyway, was if there was more focus on his old opponents. Apparently Mr.T and Dolph Lundgren were approached but both declined. But like I said before, sometimes going for the obvious isn't the right way to go. As it is, we have a film here that can stand up on it's own and not be called 'another sequel', and it is certainly a film that stands proudly alongside the original. Stallone should be proud.",Rocky Balboa
344,cdoelle,"Yo, Rock..... you DID IT!!!",8,18 December 2006,"I went to a free sneak preview of the new movie, Rocky Balboa and BOY was it fun!! Put most of the sequels in the franchise out of your mind. If you like the original Rocky, you are going to LOVE this one.This was a return to the underdog story that American fell in love with back in 1976. It was a gritty tale of the little guy digging deep and facing a tough challenge. It was definitely a feel-good movie.I was especially impressed with Sylvester Stallone's ability to resurrect the feel of the original dialog, the humor, the background of a working class Philadelphia, and even the pre-cosmetic surgery face. Yo, Rock - you DID IT!!",Rocky Balboa
345,Zando777,"Good film, good conclusion",8,29 January 2007,"I saw Rocky I when it first came out as a young kid. While it some ways a dark film, especially initially, it was also undeniably inspiring and uplifting in many ways, which is probably why it won an academy award.I continued to be a fan of Stallone and Rocky as an adolescent in the 1980's, and enjoyed the following Rockys (3 and 4 more than 2). 5 was of course a piece of crap, and I felt I had largely outgrown Stallone and Rocky by that point.However, I heard good things about this film, and thought I'd check it out.I was very pleasantly impressed. This film captures the spirit and tone of the first film better than any of the sequels. While a bit cheesy at moments, with some scenes and monologues that go on too long, it is also genuinely moving at times. The movie brought me to tears more than once, and I actually broke into applause during the fight scene.This movie is about very basic elements: Love, loss, sadness, anger, aging, and yet, at the end, hope, determination, and being willing to fight for your dreams. And to be willing to stand up. As others have stated, there are two monologues here that that are genuinely stirring, with important lessons. And the fight itself is alone worth the price of admission, especially when we know the emotions that are driving it. Rocky is not fighting for money, or a championship -- he is fighting for self-respect, for a sense that he still has something to offer. And by the end of the film, regardless of the outcome, we realize he has won that.An excellent fim that in many ways is even more inspiring and uplifting than the original -- a film that reminds us that true victory lies in being true to ourselves, and what we feel, need, and believe in, regardless of others' opinions.",Rocky Balboa
346,YugoNinja,A good farewell,7,17 April 2007,"Rocky Balboa is a very solid film and in my opinion the best possible ending to a very successful series. Just like with the first Rocky this one has a softer tone, it focuses more on individual characters than on boxing and on the final fight. The changes to the character of Rocky also surprised me and at the same time I was very delighted. Why? Because as the series progressed so did Rocky's IQ. In Rocky IV and V he was almost as articulate as a Harvard professor. The more blows he received to the head (at least 200 blows in Rocky IV) the more he became intelligent. Well, in Rocky Balboa Rocky is again the good ol' Rocky. Simple, generous, a little bit ingenuous, but fair and with a huge heart. Stallone really surprised me, because this movie is not about boxing, boxing is just a tool here. It is about what you want to do in your life, with your life. It is about the struggle to obtain what you really want. Rocky's speech to his son is a very good example. Rocky never wanted to quit. Rocky loves to fight, he's all about fighting, in the ring and outside it. Forget about the exaggerations, the excess of the previous films (III, IV and V), Rocky Balboa is simple and beautiful. Never pretentious and never banal, see it not only if you are a Rocky fan. This movie is meant for everyone.",Rocky Balboa
347,yodaccm,A Knockout!,8,20 March 2007,"Rocky is back and better than ever! And although this is definitely his final outing, it is the best ending to a series one could ask for. I've always liked the character Rocky, not because he has a cast-iron jaw (although, that helps), because he is a big, lovable goof with a huge heart. And in this movie, it is no different. We find a lonely and retired Rocky still grieving for the loss of his wife and soul mate Adrian years after her death, a distant and conflicted son, and a city that loves the old champ, but has moved on. Rocky has always been about the human condition and the interaction of characters, where you could substitute anything for the boxing and you could still have the same story. It's been done numerous times, but something about Stallone's character makes it special. I highly recommend this movie to any fans of the series and anyone looking for a movie with a wonderful and inspiring message of hope and heart.",Rocky Balboa

349,clay_thompson,A Fittng Ending - Best since the original Rocky,10,21 December 2006,"What does an old fighter do? What does an old writer do? What does an old director do? If he is Sylvester Stallone, he writes the best script of his life, and does his best job of direction of his life.Stallone penned and directed a most human story, capturing the heart of Rocky the fighter and Rocky the man. When Rocky was forced into retirement, his life was full of ""what ifs."" The beast was still alive ""in the basement"" of his life. Rocky had not fought his last fight, but he had to make a life with what was left after the events of Rocky V.The Rocky films were always contained two stories that were intertwined. Certainly there were the stories of the fights: Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago. But there was also the great love story between Rocky and Adrian. This film delivers on both counts, but it may be the most life affirming of all the Rocky films.When we see the sixty year old Rocky Balboa, we see a face marked by everyone of the thousands of blows to the face, but we start to see that this Rocky is still a sweet caring guy, who hasn't forgotten where he came from. Before he came together with Adrian, he was merely a 'ham and egger' who lost as many fights as he won. After Adrian became the completion of his life, he finds something in himself to believe in, and later he sees her love transforming him after he thought he had everything to lose and nothing to gain. Adrian was as tough in facing life's challenges as Rocky was in facing his opponents in the ring.This is the most human of the Rocky films, and I am afraid that younger viewers will miss a very good message, although it is much more than a message film.It is just good story telling.",Rocky Balboa
350,gabbymoron,8...9...10... It Sucks!,1,20 December 2006,"I've had poops that pack more of a wallop than Rocky Balboa.Where to begin? Sylvester Stallone is NOT an underdog boxer who comes out of retirement after a computer simulation suggests he might have a shot at dethroning the Heavyweight champ. Here he's looking more like Robert Hegyes on a drinking binge, frowning at schoolchildren and getting orange powder from Cheese Puffs all over his fingers. I miss the Sly of old who would pop up out of nowhere and whack you upside the head with nun-chucks. The whole experience was like some bad rerun of The Crotch Chronicles.There are so many other flaws, it's hard to keep track of all of them. Rocky's opponent this time, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, is just plain poopy. Where are the Apollo Creeds, the Ivan Dragos, the Perry Brasches when you need them? I personally liked the idea of getting Bull the bailiff from Night Court in the ring. Dy-no-mite!What I will say is that Rocky Balboa has some pretty crazy twists and turns. Without giving too much away, the scene with the pants really threw me for a loop. Plus, the acting is actually pretty good. It's good to see Mr. T reprise his role as Clubber Lang, now a down-and-out addict roaming the streets of North Carolina. It's the human angles that make these pictures work.Overall, I do not recommend Rocky Balboa.",Rocky Balboa
351,imoan1212,I Loved This Movie,9,2 January 2007,"I have always been a huge Rocky fan, huge. Even if some of the movies were not very good, I would try to find something that would redeem them. A quote, or a moment in the movie that just stood out to me. I was never a hater like some people that claim to be Rocky fans. This movie was everything I wished that it could be. It was great. If you are a Rocky fan you will love this movie. The humor is there, the sweetness is there, and the sadness is there as well. We see Rocky as a fractured man, we see him simple and at times very sad. His heart is always true and we get what I think most of the other films lacked, the heart that Rocky 1 had. I left this movie feeling very happy and excited with a tear in my eye. I am a true fan and Stallone ended the Rocky series on a very high note. I recommend this movie if you believe in the underdog and if you have heart.",Rocky Balboa
352,KingAtor42,Falls A Few Punches Short Of A Knockout,7,28 December 2006,"The plot, scenes, and emotions are delivered in the same manner that the title character tends to speak. Short bursts of sentences that tend to get stumbled through, occasional flashy vocabulary usage, and a spare joke here and there. There are hardly any in depth scenes and even the ones meant to cause the biggest emotions and reflections fly by too swiftly. As a result this movie is a near hit but finds itself lacking in the types of places you'd not expect.First of all, let me throw out some praise where it is deserved. This movie succeeds in virtually every attempt that its most recent predecessor failed miserably. For first time since Rocky II we see Rocky as he originally should have been written. The glamorous Rock in Rocky 3, the undeveloped Rocky in Rocky 4, and the terrible ""street-tough"" Rocky of Rocky 5 are mercifully in the past. This movie captures Rocky's mannerisms, attitude and speech and Stallone delivers his best performance in the role in over 2 decades.Another surprising development was an impressively humanistic portrayal of his rival in this film. Rocky 3 and 4 featured completely hollow opponents whose past we had no insight into. Whose personality was rarely flexible and whose plot purpose was paper thin and transparent. I won't even get started on ""Tommy Gunn"". In this movie the rival, Mason Dixon, is the opposite. He's not a cold, heartless pugilist but rather has a sense of his own image. He's sold so well that by the end of the film I found it a struggle as to whom I wanted to win, the aged hero or the younger star.The narrative does an excellent job of setting up a Rocky protégé, Mason Dixon. As we find out, he has his own ""Micky"" whom he confides in. He's well aware of his own decadence and flamboyance. We even hear a speech from his coach in one of the better delivered moments of the movie that relates him almost directly to Rocky himself.The movie overreaches and overextends itself in regions though. At first its charming recollections from Rocky are well done (turtles, Spider, etc). But it seems the writers were so obsessed with that device that they soon start beating it into the ground for inspiration. Firstly, Little Marie is overused as a character. Her presence becomes intrusive to the point where she's nearly a love interest. It would have been more effective to lessen her role. Steps seemed out of place until the lack of connection between Rocky and Robert became more prevalent. Though the entire father-son dilemma was a good subplot, it got cast aside and fixed very poorly near the end as if they couldn't write a more complete resolution. Paulie on the other hand seems to bounce back and forth from comic relief and deeply emotional.What is definitely missing from this film is the heart pounding moments. The big, philosophical speeches Adrian delivers in Rocky 3 and 4 are not present. The best such lines in this movie are fleeting and easily could have been drawn out into better prepared scenes. The ""Little Marie"" and ""Rocky to Robert"" speeches could've been so much more splendid with a little more delivery. The ""Commission"" scene sure seemed like it was building towards bigger moments but it fizzled from there on. What once were deeply emotional exchanges in other Rocky flicks became 5 line statements and then another scene popped up. The movie does thankfully reconnect very powerfully with Rocky's emotional anguish, something we haven't really seen since Rocky 3.This movie ultimately manages to land its hardest punches in the right places. This time around they nailed the main character and poured in a big dose of humanity to both boxers. This story is more about Rocky himself than about yet another fight. The film has its reflective and solemn moments as well but short changes itself on the secondary plot elements. It would have been nice to see a little more boxing added in (possibly a warm up, 'local' fight) and especially see some ideas and scenes more elaborated upon. The movie had plenty of time to make it happen but instead it short changes us through a swift delivery.Overall I give it 2.5/4",Rocky Balboa
353,iambrdy,Surprising,7,1 January 2007,"OK, I wouldn't say this was a GREAT film, but it was certainly entertaining and completely caught me off guard. The writing is honest, the characters are believable and movie is a well articulated piece of film-making. Rocky 3 and 4 were such disappointments, and I had not seen Rocky 5, however this film had some real intelligence and a backbone of optimism that is not contrived or forced like most superhero or underdog films, the optimism is all character driven and really resignates much more fully than previous Rocky films. This film really taps the essence of what made the first film great, and is much more true to that idiom than the over-hyped film real-estate of the 80's. This film is free of forced moments and plays out as honestly as it could hope too. I really wish this film had of been Rocky 4.By the same token... Some elements of the story push to hard too quickly and attempt to force sympathy. I would have been pulled in more by seeing a less Hallmark closure to one of the series most vital characters, and the whole story doesn't come out as simply as it could if Rocky were to experience something more everyday, and then the aftermath would be much more of a tug n the characters direction. Good things happen to Bad people, much the same as bad things happen to good. I think if it would have been more signifigant to have written something more final, but less of an end for that character. So Rocky has some sense of failure that fuels him more that just his ambition, the other side of that coin would suggest that ambitions are enough, and should always be... But, I think for cinematic reasons he should have had less esteem to work from, and more to work out. If that makes sense.All in all, a good film, definitely worth a viewing.",Rocky Balboa
354,crow1701,Stallone goes back to his writing roots,8,29 December 2006,"Around ten years ago I remember that Gene Siskel was reviewing a bad movie that Stallone had written (prolly Over the Top), and he made the camera guy focus in on him and he said something to the effect of, ""Stallone, I don't know why you choose to write such crap. You have shown that you are a good writer because of the first Rocky. Please don't make us suffer through these kinds of movies any more."" It took a long time but he did it. This film is not about the fight or about the training scenes. It's about heart and depth of characters. At sixty years old (which is now considered the new ""Middle Age""), you see that he is writing about what he is going through, and what others his age must be facing. Did I do enough in life? Did I accomplish all that I wanted? How will history/family look upon me after my passing? These are questions we all must eventually face, and I hope we all take his powerful words to heart, ""Time goes by for everybody. Especially if you're standing still."" After leaving the film, I was so inspired by his example that it made me truly look at my life and I wondered if others got the same out of it.I think if myself and others are looking at how to enrich our lives from this point on Stallone did his job with his script.",Rocky Balboa
355,objesguy,"Nothing Great, but Nothing Bad either",7,28 December 2006,"Everyone pretty much had low expectations for this movie when it came out. And saying that, i can't blame them. I mean, after the woefully bad Rocky V, did the world need another Rocky? Well, probably not, but at least this serves as a better finisher than the previous finale, even if the subject matter is a bit past its prime like Stallone himself.First of off, Rocky is Rocky and it's either a love him or hate him kind of character. Surprisingly, I was enamored with his character this time around. No stupid conflicts here, no US vs. Russia, no trainer vs. student stuff, in this sixth version, just a simple character study, much like the first two. Of course, for those who are impatient with their movies probably won't like this, but then again, if a viewer can't stand all the Philly talk, Pauly's yapping, and Rocky's interesting take on life, then they shouldn't be watching Rocky movies in the first place. Rocky Balboa, the movie, reminds the viewer what it was like and brings it into a modern day world. Those who truly loved the series especially the first two movies, will like Stallone's choice to bring it back to its roots.However, despite the nostalgia of Rocky Balboa, the movie really fails to bring anything new. In fact, if anything, I can see why it is called Rocky Balboa rather than Rocky VI. It isn't a sequel, but almost a remake. A modern day remake of the first Rocky. With that being said, none of the supporting characters other than Rocky and Pauly make an impact because it seems as if they're being compared to the superb cast of the first Rocky. Mason Dixon can't hold a candle to Apollo Creed, the new trainer who helped him in Rocky IV isn't no Mick, and of course Marie ain't no Adrian. Granted, Stallone's intention probably wasn't for Rocky Balboa to be compared so closely to the first and best Rocky, but with it being so close in material and spirit, comparisons can't help but me made, and that's what ruins it more than anything.That shouldn't take away from one's movie experience though. If anything, Rocky Balboa, is worth the price of admission and furthermore, it should be a reminder of how great the first couple of Rocky movies really. It only took over 30 years, but finally Rocky gets the conclusion it rightfully deserves. Maybe not the champ, but with respect nonetheless.Final Analysis: Recommended.

I don't know how else to gauge the rating of a movie other than by either enjoying it from start to finish, or can't wait to go home, and if I can't wait to go home, then I didn't get my money's worth, and then I would rate the movie a one. If the movie was mildly entertaining where I'm able to muster up the patience for it to end, I'll give it a five. I just can't really seem to pick apart a movie so much where I'm able to rate it a 4.5 or a 7.1.I enjoyed ""Rocky Balboa"" from start to finish. It was a movie that actually tries to engage the audience. I enjoyed the nostalgia moments, and then appreciated Paulie even more for waking us up out of the past. I actually sincerely laughed at the various moments of humor that wasn't laced with sexual innuendo, cursing, or ridiculing another person. I got choked up at a few moments, probably for the wrong reasons. I felt the adrenaline rise during the few tense scenes and had to laugh it off (I loved it when Rocky grabs the thug on the street to put him in his place after saying, ""It's not alright""). I actually felt the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and the chills through my body when Rocky lifts the weights over his head. And after getting knocked down in the ring, Rocky convinces himself to get up, and the look he shoots at Mason was worth the ten bucks.I was 7 years old when I saw the original Rocky on TV in 1978.

What a great movie. It's right up there with the first one. A couple of surprises, good acting and some ""flirting"" with the previous movies and a great, realistically filmed final fight.Rocky is a movie that is mandatory to watch because it's a movie about real persons, with real fears and hopes.

358,gartner,I'd recommend it! no spoilers,8,22 December 2006,"Being in my 30's and being old enough to have remembered the original when it was kinda new, I was intrigued by ""Rocky Balboa""--- I assumed it would be a train wreck but warranted viewing if only because I had seen all the other installments in the theater and to possibly revel at it's mediocrity....well........perhaps I am guilty of getting caught up in the considerable nostalgia of ""Rocky Balboa"" but I was thoroughly surprised by the film.This final installment is not a gratuitous throw away at all but instead a surprisingly legit film that is easily the best in the series since III and I personally would rank it ahead of III. There are little things I could nit pick for not clicking right, but the movie got so much else correct, I won't bother.Rocky Balboa succeeds in doing what Rocky V tried but somehow failed to do effectively; bring the character away from the superhero he became in III (enjoyably) and IV (ridiculously) and back to the tough but sweet, dumb but so smart in his own way guy that made him so easy to root for.Don't expect the world, but if you enjoyed Rocky and Rocky II, you just might be as shocked as I was. 8 out of 10",Rocky Balboa
359,samuelthemovieman,Wonderful final chapter,9,29 December 2006,"I have always seen the Rocky films as kind of modern day fairy tales(the first one being one of my top ten favorites ever), but then I realized that they are not about a story, they are about a character, and Stallone does great justice to his character.To view this film as ""another rocky movie"" simply won't cut it. It takes place in the modern world of today, Rocky's wife Adrien passed away a few years ago and he still mourns her. He owns an Italian restaurant outside of Philadelphia where he tells old fight stories at peoples request, he helps Paulie out at the meat place sometimes, and his son who's in his mid twenties feels uncomfortable around his old man because of his celebrity. The current heavyweight champion is a young thirty two year old named Mike Dixon, who is outraged after a computer simulated fight between him and Rocky shows Balboa victorious. It's not as if he challenges Rocky after that, it's hard to explain you'll have to see the movie.One of the great things about the film is how the characters don't seem fake or played out, they seem real, and I loved the way Rocky has changed in this movie. He has gotten older, wiser, and him alone could make this movie impossible to dislike. There two scenes where he delivers speeches, one to his son the other to these judges who deny him a license, and they both ran shivers down my spine. Rocky's relations and interactions reminded me of some of my elders that I have outings with rather often. He doesn't make anything fake, all is real, nothing is played out.Stallone deserves an Oscar nomination for best director in my opinion. The fight scenes are so exhilarating, I felt my heart beating at a hundred miles a minute. There were people in the audience so exited they were calling out things like ""get him! Get him!"", or ""to the right! to the right!"" He gives it an awesome look, captures certain feelings of family, but most importantly of all, he lifts your spirit high.",Rocky Balboa
360,julie-james80,An amazing comeback from such a poor-ish fifth movie!,10,17 June 2008,"Rocky Balboa is about the most predictable movie there is... BUT its also a great film. I don't think its the best Rocky movie but it certainly beats Rocky V.Id have to say my favourite Rocky film is 4, this is because I'm more of an action fan and id say Rocky 4 was for the action but in this film we get to see the original Rcky again, sure he seems a little bit more intelligent but hes still a fun and loving guy, and with the loss of his wife he has a lot on his hands, but he gets by.Spider Richo came back, which i thought was nice, a lot of the original cast was part of this new movie, but thats what i liked!It was a nice movie and all but it missed the action but it made up with the emotion. Its a great Film 10/10. Fans will love it. Forget the age hype! SYVELSTER LOOKS YOUNGER THAN EVER!",Rocky Balboa
361,dada_neso,Great movie,10,25 December 2006,"Stallone is just perfect as Rocky, a ""bum"" who gets a shot at the Heavyweight title in Boxing. The script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well. This is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and almost feels very real. he characters here feel real and authentic, and most of all, completely human. Nothing spectacular about them, more or less lowlifes who wouldn't arouse any interest in other people than social workers perhaps.It ain't over 'til it's over...",Rocky Balboa
362,flyingcandy,"Nothing Gained, Nothing Lost",6,22 December 2006,"Well, it was okay I guess. Kind of boring, but had a nice little pace. Still it needed more corniness. Needed some of that cheesy stuff that made us wince enjoyably at part three and five (part four I won't even mention because it was so horrible). I mean, okay... if you're going to play it straight, that's fine, but not so slow. The first movie wasn't slow because the slow parts were involving, and interesting, and... original. Now to the actors. The champion ""Mason Dixon"" - the guy who played him - was boring. We needed an ""Apollo Creed"" type of villain that we love to hate, and that we want Rocky to clobber. Rocky's son lacked what even Sly's real life son Sage had in part five, that is, involvement and energy. This actor who played Rocky Jr was just like ""Mason"", boring as heck. As was the girlfriend, ""Marie"". Then again, I didn't mind her as much. It was nice that she was a normal looking lady, and not some supermodel. I wouldn't have put it past Sly to have that happen, let Rocky get a trophy girl. It's nice he went the realistic route for his main gal. And lastly, Burt Young, by far the best character in all the movies, and deep down, everyone's favorite. The poor guy though, now, is too old to even deliver his lines. Thus he couldn't be the comic relief that was needed. Now for the look of the film; the style. The edits were too fast. It seemed like something from television, like a ""Grey's Anatomy"" or one of those quickly paced cop shows. This is meant for an edgy feel, but came out more awkward, rushed. And the end fight seemed as if you were watching a pay-per-view, and was sort of a let-down. All in all though, this film was okay. Or perhaps, just okay enough. It didn't hurt, but didn't help much either. Nothing gained, nothing lost. Farewell to Rocky. More of a whimper than a bang, but that's okay. We love the guy anyway.",Rocky Balboa
363,dbuffalo,"A-Rockalypto --- before one more cheesy worn-out movie series begins, another one must end (and thank God this one doesI hope).",3,20 December 2006,"I was a huge fan of the early Rocky films (Rocky, Rocky II, and Rocky III). I was completely burned out with the silly excesses of Rocky IV. I was incredibly disappointed with what I considered a reasonably well conceived but poorly written and produced Rocky V (which audiences avoided in 1990).But like Rocky, I just kept coming back. Darn it, if I didn't get sucker-punched again.The movie, written, directed, and produced by Sylvester Stallone, still has that homey and comfortable feel of the original film. Sly is still Rocko, that lovable unpretentious, honest loser we knew and loved from the first film. What is missing in this one is that there is no emotional tension or adversity the Rocky of old has to overcome. That element is what made those phony-over-the-top Rocky comebacks so fun to forget as being completely ridiculous and yet fun to remember as being somehow overwhelmingly appealing.Who or what does Rocky have left to fight for? Adrian (its no secret, it's in the trailer) is dead. His son (played by Milo Ventimiglia) has turned out (as one might expect from the last two films) to be a self-absorbed metro-sexual-yuppie-geek who feels overshadowed by his has-been-turned-two-time-champion-turned-has-been dad. Rocky still pines for Adrian, the old days of fighting, and is just regretting his place in life (in his late fifties, though Sly in real-life is 61). And Pauly, well, what can we say? Burt Young still plays the overbearing amateur-alcoholic-and-meat-packing jerk that Pauly always was, with a little more gray hair. These two are really all that's left who could possibly be killed off to add some between-credits pathos over which Rocky could pump some testosterone before entering a ring to fight someone.Alas, nothing really happens.Even the champion (Mason 'The Line' Dixon, played by Antonio Tarver) is a likable guy, who is fighting Rocky because there is no one around who can give the champ a good fight. He's even pretty humble and loves his trainer and manager. He's no arch-villain or over-dog like Clubber Lange.At any rate, the entire idea of a computer match-up between Rocky and Dixon sparks the usual over-the-top discussion of a real boxing match, and you know the rest. The champ's agents do dinner with Rocky. Rocky thinks about it for perhaps 45 seconds, and there you go. There is a fight, but this time, only for charity. Again, no real tension is building.Does Rocky have a love interest in this picture? No. He has a ""like""-interest in Marie (a former teenager he walked home years before to keep out of trouble), played by Geraldine Hughes, who weaves into the story as the maitre d' at Rocky's restaurant, Adrian's (Isn't that a touching name?). Even the new dog that Rocky and Marie's son Steps (played by James Francis Kelly III) picks out is a cheesy mutt with a really cheesy name (you won't like it, so I won't spoil it by telling you the name). A stuffed replica of Butkus could have been glued to a skateboard and pulled for better effect. Any animal (even an opossum) would have been a better choice.There are some light-hearted and decently emotional moments in this film, but not a lot to really drive one to empathy. We have all been there before, and this time it just doesn't quite work. There are quite a few funny lines also, but not enough to keep you interested even in a film that runs only 102 minutes.The amazing thing about this film, however, is that the fight sequences (which are shown in a manner of an HBO PPV special) might be the best of any of the Rocky movies. Even that, however, is damaged by the use of black and white overlays, and a complete erasure of the middle rounds of the fight. For an old guy, Sly is amazingly apt to the task, even in simulated fight conditions. He is in fabulous shape, and because he is not trying to over-emote in the ring, the jab and uppercut sequences are amazingly crisp for a staged fight.The bottom line for Rocky Balboa is that it is a rather lame, staid trip down a memory lane that few will care about. In fact, no one in the film remembers because all of the characters save three who traveled down that road are deceased. The only thing that really dies in this film, despite the good production value, is the viewer's interest, assuming the viewer is like me.This one is a renter, most certainly, and does not belong in your Rocky collection. It could easily been a made-for-TV special, but clearly, even the networks would not have produced this one.I rate this one a barely a three. It scores one point for each of the first three 'good' Rocky films. Sadly though, this film is disqualified from the final ratings fight for lack of interest, and may subsequently be banned from the Boxing Film Commission (as if there were one).Don't fight the rush hour traffic to see this one.",Rocky Balboa
364,tksaysso,A Fitting End To a Great Series,9,22 December 2006,"Like many people I cringed when I heard the news that Sly Stallone was going to revive the Rocky series one more time. How in the world is he going to do this without embarrassing himself?I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie and by Stallone's performance. Rather than gloss over or ignore the obvious problem of Rocky's advancing years Stallone wisely pretty much wrapped the whole movie around that reality. Much like the original this film is more of a character study than a boxing or action film.Now a widower and being somewhat estranged from his son Rocky now spends most of his time running his small Italian restaurant named after his beloved Adrian. When a simulated computer match between the current heavyweight champ and Rocky ends with Rocky winning the stage is set for an actual match between the champ Mason ""The Line"" Dixon and the beloved Philadelphia underdog. The subsequent match is at the same time riveting and believable.I actually had tears in my eyes and a huge lump in my throat at the end of this movie. I think I was most sad that I was bidding farewell to a movie character who had carved a small place in my heart and mind over the years.Good for you Sly. You ended it beautifully and on your own terms. Thank you for the gift of Rocky.",Rocky Balboa
365,Hotwyre6,A Chick Flick for Guys,7,20 December 2006,"Although the title of this review may appear to denote a disparaging opinion of the film, Rocky Balboa is simply different enough from its predecessors that it ought to be noted. It should also be noted that the ring action in all the Rocky films is always the culmination of the fighters' inner turmoil and is representative of their internal challenges; of course this one is no different. The distinction is the emphasis upon which this film places the crises of the protagonist. Some may prefer the prevalence of the drama in this one, and some may prefer the older films' emphasis on the symbolism of the ring. Regardless, the film is a worthy effort, sufficient to stand amongst the other Rocky films, for good or ill.",Rocky Balboa
366,franco-10,Worth all the hype,10,24 December 2006,"Fortunately I had decided to watch the original Rocky a few days before seeing this last one, and I am glad I did since there are lots of references to characters and events from the first movie. So I would recommend seeing the original first. I actually believe Rocky Balboa is better than the original! One of the main reasons for this are the impromptu speeches he gives to the boxing commission and to his son, speeches full of real-life advise that really are coming from what Stallone has learned in his own personal life. Also the character of Rocky Balboa has obviously matured, but still retains his sense of humor and likability.",Rocky Balboa
367,mas_leo333,Miss-match,5,6 January 2007,"This is not a very good addition to the Rocky collection, apart from the way his life seems to have changed, which is almost believable. The story to me may have lacked any new input and seemed to be a replica of the original masterpiece. The worst was that Tarver is a recognised heavy weight with a few ring skills and Stallone has not learnt a bit of boxing in any of the Rocky's. So the Match-up was a miss-match to be kind. They should have made him come back to the ring in 5 if that was the plan and not wait so long. Foreman managed it with his height and strength but having a good jaw a 60 does not make for a heavy weight title fight. Nice but like Arnold in Terminator 3. No CIGAR (at ALL).",Rocky Balboa
368,booyatom,"You can rest now, Rocko. Thanks for everything.",9,23 December 2006,"While promoting ""Rocky Balboa"", Sylvester Stallone declared that his intentions were to redeem the Rocky series and end it right, once and for all. That makes perfect sense seeing as how every Rocky movie since the classic first installment was inferior. The fifth movie, which came out in 1990, brought a sour and abrupt end to the series. Stallone wanted his immortalized character to go out in style, the way he has to go out. With ""Rocky Balboa"" he does just that, and then some.Many people were down on this film, saying the plot is ridiculous. But the way I think of it, what better way is there to end the Rocky series with one of the greatest underdog stories ever? ""Rocky I"" is an underdog story, perhaps even more so than this Rocky installment, but nobody complained about that film. Stallone, at 60 years old, still looks as strong as an ox, so I see no problem with the plot.In fact, it gives way to great wisdom. Why is it that when the simplest of characters say the wisest of things, they sound so much better and ring so much truer than when someone else says them? I think back to Forrest Gump (""Life is like a box of chocolate"") and a whole lot of Joe Pesci characters. Here Rocky says to his son ""Nothing hits harder than life It's not about how hard you can hit but about how hard you can get hit."" That sounds so much more believable from Rocky than from, say, Paris Hilton.Rocky movies put Rocky up against impossible odds and more often than not, he succeeds. The reason they are so loved is that Rocky represents so well the everyman. Born and raised on the streets, he had nothing at all, and even when he made it, he was still the same old Rocko.""Rocky Balboa"" goes back to the basics. He is once again a simple guy with a painfully simple life, haunted by the same beast that lives inside of him and everyone else. This beast yearns for something more than it has, it yearns for the full expansion of the soul it lives in.The other reason Rocky is so loved by everyone is that he actually deals with the beast. Instead of just ignoring it (like a lot of people do) and being a bum his whole life, he goes to the top. But now that he's at the bottom again, with no Adrian and an absent son, the beast needs feeding again.It's no coincidence that the character Rocky Balboa is a fighter. Fighting is what he does on and off the ring, and so do we in a way. That's what I love about Rocky (I and VI, that is); that parallel it draws between fighting and life.Now we see Stallone at his best. This Rocky reminded me of the first one, which can only be a good sign. They take back a lot of the original Rocky landmarks like running up the steps and drinking raw eggs, but they don't feel forced at all. If you're going to wrap up a legendary series, why not give a little wink to the first one? In fact, most of the movie deals with the past. Or should I say Rocky deals with the past. It is my opinion that he keeps talking about Adrian and his past accomplishments in order to make sense of where he is at the beginning of the movie. It is as if he's trying to convince himself that his past was worth-while, so he should accept where he's ended up. But the beast wins him over.I think Stallone should at the very least be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award. He's got a kind of desperate intensity in this film that makes his character so believable that if I saw him in person on the street I'd probably say ""Yo Rocko!"" The film is masterfully controlled; nothing is rushed. Stallone takes his time showing Rocky's dilemmas and in showing why Rocky decides to go back into the ring, so much so that when the old Rocky-in-training music begins, I won't lie to you, tears started welling up inside me. The writing is great, and I really liked that simulated fight which jolts Rocky's decision.First class acting, a beautiful homage to the classic Rocky; go see this movie, it's brilliant.",Rocky Balboa
369,blaisepascal,Everything I could have hoped for and more,10,21 December 2006,"My review of this movie is going to be straight to the point and from the heart, just like Rocky Balboa. I had huge expectations coming in. The Rocky series is one of my favorites, but Rocky V was such a disappointing way to end it. When I first heard about Rocky VI I, like any sane movie goer, had my doubts. But from the time I saw the first trailer on (the one that was just the close up of his eyes), I knew in my gut this would be great. Sly took the only thing left that could make Rocky the underdog once again, father time, and used it to his advantage. And most of all for me, the reason why this movie hits so close to home is because I too once lost the love of my life. I know the crushing grief that follows you around every single day as a result and Rocky Balboa captures it with tragic accuracy. This is a movie for anyone who's ever loved and not given a damn what the world thinks about them because of it. This is a movie for anyone who believes in the human spirit and living life on your own terms. This is a movie that was for me, and if there's a pulse in your body, should be for you too.

But wait...somewhere between 2000 and 2002, rumors start that Stallone wants to go for a 6th round. Nah. He's way too old. But wait. A couple more years go by and he announces that Rocky will return. You're kidding, right. Dude, you're in your late 50s. Alright, we'll see. I saw...not in theaters, unfortunately, but the week it hit DVD, I grabbed it. WOW!!! He did it. Simply put, this movie rocks. The ""getting old doesn't mean giving up"" story is timeless, but Sly makes it his own. The first part of the movie is about what everybody's been doing, what they've become. Sly, sadly a widower(Sorry, Talia), still has Paulie at his side and is trying to maintain a fractured relationship with his grown son. Sly spends the majority of his time running his restaurant. When he sees an ESPN virtual boxing match between the current champ and himself from 25 years ago, the juices start flowing. He misses the ring. He goes before the boxing commission to re-register for his license. After a few more scenes, Rocky is in a gym with Paulie, Rocky Jr. and Duke talking strategy. Then, after waiting a little over an hour, for the first time in 16 years, you hear Bill Conti's award-winning theme. You almost get chills. The rest is boxing history. The actual fight between Rock and the champ is great. The energy, the audience, the spectacle. It's all worth it. Rocky Balboa is the best sequel next to Rocky 2 and the perfect happy ending to one of the best, longest-living movie franchises in film history. Mr. Stallone, I commend you.",Rocky Balboa
371,jrummerboy,all great until the final fight scene,5,7 April 2007,"i really liked the whole movie until the end where they went to this TV style video look for the beginning of the fight and it just didn't look good. they also used some really crappy overdubbed dialog, until round 10 when they went to audio they recorded on the set. it made no sense at how bad it sounded. totally distracting. so be prepared for some terrible ADR.i will say this, when the rocky theme kicks in during the training chapter, i couldn't wipe the smile off my face remembering how cool the original movies were. it was just like watching the new superman movie. when the theme song starts at the beginning i had chills for days. its too bad that movie sucked so bad. eesh.",Rocky Balboa

Paulie is still around, works in a meat house like he used to in""Rocky one"".during the film,a TV channel broadcasts this fictional fight made by computer, that sees the reigning champion Mason ""the line""Dixon go head to head with former champion Rocky Balboa.this fictional fight generates a lot of interest in public especially in rocky ,who then decides to came out of retirement and start fighting again.Mason Dixon's manager, in the company of a promoter,knowing that Rocky is back in the boxing frame,pays him a visit at his restaurant with an offer to fight the reigning champion in a 10 round exhibition match.The fight eventually materializes and takes place in Las Vegas.the film is good but its exactly the same as the first with only a much older Rocky.it has the same training sequence as the first,punching the meat running up the famous stairs,the relationship between Rocky and Marie,exactly the same as the one between Rocky and Adrian in the first and so on..... one thing that i don't understand is WHY!!why is THIS MOVIE rated higher than its predecessors.???(except the first).they were so entertaining and fun and in the true sense of word CLASSICS.i prefer more Rocky 5 than this one.OK is wasn't one of the best but it was original and emotional.I'm a die hard fan of Rocky,i grew up watching all the five films.I rank this sixth chapter not amongst the best or amongst the worst of the series but as simply ""FINE"".For me the story in this movie,has been told before and in a better way.""SLY,i honestly prefer the conclusion of the fifth movie.""my vote 6/10",Rocky Balboa

Rocky had somehow lost his vulnerability as he built bigger and better defined muscle mass in movies 2-5. It's only now, as he reaches the end of his career and realizes that he is pushing his aging body to its limit, that the vulnerable Rocky from the first movie returns. The loss of Adrian compounds this.I would have to say that the best scene is the confrontation with his son toward the end of the film. I was with a group of friends when I saw this, and the men in the group (not ""Rocky"" fans, but humoring we females) agreed to a man that it was the kind of talk that more fathers should give their sons, and a talk that they wish their fathers had given at various points in their lives.Absolutely a return to greatness, and a triumph for Stallone.",Rocky Balboa

This movie has a lot more heart than I suspected, and much more than previous Rockys. After I saw the trailer I thought this would be the same kind of self-ironic trash like Terminator 3 was. Well, not exactly 'trash' but, you know, just not a serious movie.I was so wrong and I'm happy I was! Stallone actually can act! There are two very emotional scenes (one with Paulie, one with his son), the first one almost made my (!very sensitive guy!) cry :-) This movie has everything it needs! Great cast (not a single miscast here, everyone fits perfectly), a MESSAGE to tell, heart, tears and action. I think this one is on par with the original Rocky. I'm very happy Stallone got the chance to make this one, struggling so long with wise-ass producers who tried to tell him that nobody wants to see this or that he was to old. Bullsht!

377,LionsLord,"Great, but the greatest?",10,23 December 2006,"I have just finished watching Rocky Balboa (in italics as not to confuse the character with the movie title) and really enjoyed it. I am a HUGE fan of the Rocky series and have watched the previous 5 many times. My friends say I am a living encyclopedia of the Rocky series, and I take that as a complement!I have to admit that originally I was worried that the new addition would cheapen the name of Rocky. Some people have labeled it a cash cow for Stallone, but I don't agree. It is a great movie in its own right and should be seen by any fan of the original 5.To compare Rocky Balboa to the original 5 I would have to say it like this: Rocky Balboa is the only real movie since Rocky to be able to compare the 'under dog' feeling. Yes I would agree that Rocky II also had a great under dog feeling to it, but not like the first. In the first, Rocky was a no body stepping into the ring with an awesome champion.I would have to say that Rocky IV had the best impossible fight. I don't want to say too much about Rocky Balboa or I will spoil things, but once you see the film, I'm sure you will understand. I would actually have to say the movie with the most feeling would be Rocky V. I know many people would not agree, but I think that is because people were expecting to see Rocky pull himself out of his bankruptcy, but he didn't. He did however pull himself out of the life problems of his family falling apart. And that's the golden key. That's what Rocky is all about, His life out of the ring. People did not watch Rocky V for the movie itself, which was actually great! The scene with Mick and Rocky where Mick gives Rocky the golden glove from Rocky Marciano's cufflink still holds the record for making my friend cry hardest!Rocky Balboa was/is great!

The cynical crowd will complain about the sappy nature of the movie and that is understandable. I personally enjoyed the sentimentality. Maybe I'm a sucker but I can't help but think every single ""sappy"" line of dialog Stallone delivers comes straight from the heart. I was moved by many of the ""moments"" and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I could have used a more hated or fleshed out foe but that is a a bit nit-picky. At the end of the day we want to love Rocky Balboa the character and the movie. People will sell the movie short but what more do you want? The movie had great characters, a great training montage (although nowhere near III and IV's) a ton of heart, and of course one more fight where Rocky tries to shock the world.I'm happy to see the series end on this note, I believe the character deserved it. The haters, the cynics, the non-Rocky fans may have no reason to be won over by the movie, but those that look forward to enjoying it should not be disappointed.I look forward to future projects by writer/director Sly Stallone and I hope he reads, and appreciates this review. He has always been a favorite of mine.",Rocky Balboa
380,MacKrazy,You Sly! You Did It!,10,26 January 2007,"One more round! Having grown up with the Rocky films, Seeing ""Rocky Balboa"" was like seeing an old friend. Amazing the last time a Rocky film was in the cinema I was 5. I think this film works better if you really know the 5 films before hand, especially 1 & 2.I really felt for Rocky, more than before. The sorrow of this old Widower who doesn't get the respect he deserves. And seeing Rocky close to tears talking about Adrian or telling his son he can do better really brought a lump to my throat.""Rocky Balboa"" brings this series back to its gritty roots from 1 & 2, something 5 tried to do, not very well. But Balboa makes Rocky V worth while as it had to happen for this tale to happen.As for those worried about the age factor, it's not a problem in fact the opposite. This film works because the fact Rocky is an old fighter with no chance, it brings to mind George Foreman's return to boxing.A lot of the familiar elements are their, I got so pumped as Rocky works out to that old familiar music and ran up those steps one last time.The final fight is one of the best, so realistic and I'm sure you'll find yourself yelling for Rocky to get up! And Stallone's physique is amazing for a 59 year old, hell it's amazing for a 39 year old. Clearly he's made of something different than rest of us.Sly deserves something for this film seriously, Writer, Director or Actor nomination but I'm sure Oscar officials will turn their noses up at the 5th sequel of a boxing drama franchise.Rocky Balboa doesn't disappointed and has shook up the way I look at the whole franchise I used to say 3 was my favourite but I can't say which is anymore.",Rocky Balboa
381,kinetsmac,No Need For A Numeral,9,5 May 2007,"As I watched the opening screen for ""Rocky Balboa"" slide across the dark background, a staple of the series since the beginning, I had to wonder to myself, ""why no number? Shouldn't this be 'Rocky VI?'"" I soon found out why Sly Stalone chose not to number this one. Because it's a fantastic film, one that he knew deserved to not have the lower quality rocky movies, like IV and V, attributed to it. With ""Balboa,"" you can watch it after only seeing the original ""Rocky,"" and still be filled in. The first movie, more than any of the others, has the strongest affect on this one, with plenty of classic characters, even the ""screw you creepo"" girl returning. And that's one of the things that makes it so good.What makes this Rocky truly special is that it has that classical air of humility that the original two had. With III and up, it was all about flash, about seeing Rocky beat guys who seemed a lot stronger than him. But if you recall from the first film, rocky even said that it didn't matter if he beat Apollo creed. Just staying in the ring that long with him was enough. It is this atmosphere that has returned with this latest installment, more than anything else, that makes it great. You feel Rocky's joys and sorrows as he delves in the world of the golden years, and it truly is a moving experience.I couldn't think of a better way for Rocky to come to an end. I know there will be movie execs biting at the bit to have Stalone make another, but something tells me that isn't going to happen. With this film, you not only feel Rocky's growth as a person, but Sylvesters to. I think the star has learned his lessons from the more money influenced Rocky movies. And for that, I am happy for him.",Rocky Balboa
382,CamMan618,A Very Well Done 6th Movie,8,16 July 2012,"I always have loved Rocky. His character, the stupid way he talks and how he can't read very well, and how he isn't the smartest guy in the world. Let's face it, the first Rocky was the best one. The 2nd was good, the 3rd was okay, the 4th was okay, and the 5th was pretty bad.When this movie came out, I had some doubts, but I knew I wanted to see it. So I saw it in theaters. I was quite surprised. Rocky wanted to fight one more time. He wanted to take on the best, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the best boxer there was. Dixon didn't take Rocky that seriously. Rocky trained for this fight like he had never trained, it was the most important fight of his life, because he wanted to prove that he could still do it.The acting in this movie was very good, I didn't like that Adrian had died, that really messed up the movie a little bit if you ask me. The ending fight felt like I was actually watching a real boxing match on pay-per-view or something. It felt very real.This was a great movie, watch it, you will see.I say 8/10.",Rocky Balboa
383,friedfysh,Brilliant!,9,18 January 2007,"If you have seen any of the Rocky series (as I'm sure anybody reading this has) you will have a fair idea what to expect. I went to see this film with a friend who pointed out that she grew up with Rocky, this is true for many of us. I was never a HUGE fan of the series but I had seen them all on television and yes I always did enjoy tuning into a Rocky film. The familiarity of the character lends the film an emotional weight, we know Rocky going into the film and we have seen him (and Sly) mature over the years, and now it's time for us to find out where life has lead him. The writing is excellent with some very human and touching moments and some great inspiring speeches; I was at the point of crying at several moments throughout the film. Yes, the plot may be a little far fetched but it is all handled in a very realistic manner. Sly may be 60, but when you see him get into that ring you will have no question about his physical condition (I'm 22 and have never been in a shape anywhere near that good). I defy anyone to see this film without feeling seriously inspired when they leave the cinema. This is by far the best of the sequels and for my money THE BEST Rocky film ever. This is what we, and Sylvester Stallone - who writes, directs and acts all with superior skill, needed most.",Rocky Balboa
384,dkw001,"Finally, he can walk away.",7,26 April 2007,"Okay. If you've seen me on the message boards I go to, you know that I'm not someone who just rehashes what everyone already knows (and has already written about). So I'm going to give you my unique interpretation of this movie.It's about a boxer who left the game just in time.Think about it. The undisputed world champ a complete joke. Everyone hates him. No real challengers on the horizon. Most sports fans don't even give a damn about boxing anymore. (Art imitates life!) Enter Rocco (Is that his actual first name? It could be...) Balboa. Despite being an amazingly simple man with hardly any real needs, he's been through a lot in is 58-odd years. Now that everyone he's been close to is either dead or...well, Paulie, he finds that there's one thing that hasn't changed. He's a fighter.And he despises that fact. That he's been pounding on guys for a living for so long, he just cannot let it go. And he desperately needs to let it go. Even that good-for-nothing lunkhead Paulie can see this.There will be one more fight. Against the paper champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. Even though it's not a title fight, the world will be at stake. This is Rocky's last chance to get all the junk out of his system, to leave everything in the ring. It's truly now or never. The sport is crumbling. If he doesn't get out, *stop* being a washed-up slugger clinging to the past, he'll crumble right with it.The manner in which the journey unfolds...from that stupid ""Looney Tunes fight"" to an angry confrontation with a group of ignorant stuffed shirts to the no-BS training sessions to the grand final battle itself...is simplicity itself. And it manages to completely avoid any kind of ""happy ending"" while still giving a resounding and highly satisfying conclusion.This is the end of Rocky, something we thought we'd never see. And for me, it was a privilege to see it.",Rocky Balboa
385,daviddavidlim86,beautiful film,9,8 February 2007,"Rocky Balboa has become one of my personal favourite movies.. was expecting a Stallone brash flick but it was far from it.. i've never actually seen the original Rocky movies but i have to say this should be one of the best 2, if not the best.. i actually shed a few tears during the scenes Rocky visits Adrian's grave or when Rocky is trying to fight his way out of his depression.. just really grabs your heart when ya least expect it.. Rocky Balboa is not only abt Rocky but also abt Dixon, a world champion who is unloved despite his success, and is desperate to find fulfillment which comes from the most unlikely of people.. it's also abt Lil Marie and trying to find new hope and glory.. it's also abt Rocky Jr. and finding a way back to the road home.. it's also abt millions of people around the world who run up those famous steps whenever they're in Philadelphia, and realising that you can be who you want to be as long as you believe it and you have to fight for it.",Rocky Balboa
386,harleysbatman,The Best Rocky Movie With The Perfect Ending!,10,30 March 2019,"I didn't really know about the Rocky Universe until I was about 20 or so. I knew of Rocky; I knew of the classic lines and images but I had never seen any of the films. Then one day, for whatever reason, my dad just started talking about Rocky and all the films and characters and I really wanted to see them! I remember the night he came home from work and presented me with the 5 DVD Rocky Box Set! I was very surprised and happy! To understand why this is special to me, or more so, is because my dad works more than an hour away from home. He stopped at four or five different stores, before he found it at a Best Buy. He made it home in 2 hours that night. Also, I had Chicken McNuggets that night. The perfect dinner to watch Rocky!That night, I watched the very first two Rocky films. Loved them! The next day I watched Rocky 3 and 4. Loved them too! The third night, I watched Rocky 5 and was let down, but still enjoyed it. I had grown attached to the characters in the Rocky Universe. I had grown attached to these characters and I was kind of sad for them at the end of the final movie. Rocky was always meant to be the underdog; to be the guy that life crapped on but even he deserved to go out better than that! So when Rocky Balboa (Or as I just like to say, ""Rocky 6"") was announced, I was thrilled!Many people say the original Rocky is the best in the series, and I can see why, and the films are close but for my money, Rocky Balboa is the best film in the series! I think Rocky and Rocky Balboa both have the emotional weight going for it. That's why they are the best in the series. Rocky 3 and 4 may have all the cool lines and cameos but they lack the raw emotional depth. Save for Mick's death. You could argue Apollo's death as well, but I feel his death came second to the fight. Rocky Balboa got the edge for me, though, because it ends on a perfect note...In Rocky Balboa, Rocky is retired, widowed and trying to live his life as best as he can. He loves and misses Adrian, who has died of cancer, and he uses work to numb that pain. On the flip side, he does not want to forget Adrian and celebrates their love whenever possible. Rocky also has lost his son, but not to death but to his shadow; to insecurity. The one person still left in Rocky's life is Paulie, the lovable but grumpy brother in law. Although he loves Rocky, he is limited in kindness and cannot always be there for him or comfort him. Rocky seems to be alone, and he doesn't like it...Meanwhile, the newest champion, Mason Dixon is getting bad press because, well, he's just too damn good! This may be the weakest part of the movie and my only real complaint. The character of Mason Dixon and the real life actor both suck. Storywise, the fans are turning against him because he wins too much; too fast and too easily. No one wants to see him box anymore. I think this is flawed because people would pay to either see their hero continue his streak or they would pay to see someone, hopefully, beat the crap out of him. Some sports show creates a dream match scenario, in where a virtual Rocky defeats the virtual Dixon, and based on this, the boxing people think that the real deal fight is exactly what needs to happen!Meanwhile, Rocky befriends an old acquaintance in Little Marie. Little Marie is the little girl from the first Rocky who called him a Creepo. She now works as a bartender and is alot more nice. Little Marie (played by Geraldine Hughes) is another reason why I love this movie so much, and the best part of the movie to me. Her portrayal of Little Marie is so real and vulnerable. Like Rocky, Little Marie has had it pretty rough too. Rocky, too, understands this but never takes advantage of this. They (along with her son) become closer and friends, all throughout the movie. Little Marie acts as the Adrian of the movie. She isn't a love interest to Rocky, and that's how it should be. Little Marie is the heart that Rocky lost. She is the drive that will keep him going, just as Adrian was. Again, I love the character of Little Marie in this film!Rocky jumps through some hoops and gets his boxing license back. He has a very emotional talk with Robert, Jr. and gets his son back. Paulie gets laid off from his job and after a heart to heart with Rocky, his brother is back. Hell, even Duke comes back to train Rocky! Rocky is getting lesser and lesser alone. The eye of the Tiger is returning! Meanwhile, Mason Dixon is learning that not everyone who says they care for him actually means it. He goes back to his old trainer, whom he left for more money and fame. His trainer says he needs to learn to fight for the right reasons; to fight when you can no longer fight. To push himself to his absolute limits! This signifies his face turn but honestly, like I said, I disliked the character so much, that I didn't really care if he was a good guy or a bad guy...Rocky and Dixon fight. Both are getting the upperhand. Both are showing their weaknesses. Rocky is shown as being slower but more knowledgeable, while Dixon is shown as faster but more arrogant. Both have fallen to the canvas and both are not giving up. The match ends, and Rocky and his new family (his son, Paulie, Little Marie and her son) leave the ring as Michael Buffer announcers the winner of the match. This is shown, I believe, to show Rocky's frame of mind, which to me, is who cares if I won or lost?! I have everything I need! The end shows Rocky talking to Adrian, at her graveside, finally accepting her death and accepting that life goes on...It's beautiful. It's my favorite Rocky movie. It's damn near perfect!",Rocky Balboa
387,K_Molen,An excellent and fitting finale to the series,8,26 December 2006,"""Rocky Balboa"" is excellent and a very fitting finale to the series. Everything about it, including its poster, pays tribute to what's come before while at the same time carving out a piece for itself in the Rocky mythos.I really can't recommend it enough and if you're even a casual fan of the series you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't check it out. Preferably while its still in theater. If for no other reason than to simply hear Bill Conti's bombastic score again the way it was meant to be heard.

Rocky. i went on to watch the rest of the series and grew to like and even love those too. however when i went to go and watch Rocky Balboa i was expecting it to be the perfect ending to what has been a classic run of boxing movies.....how disappointed i was. the story is predictable, the acting is predictable and the fight result is again predictable (so i will not reveal the result as it is predictable). The only good factor was the hot guy playing Steps. However, in light of all these factors against the movie, i stress that any fans of the Rocky series watch this as it will perhaps give the closure needed. p.s. if you go and watch this at the cinema be sure to drink some coffee, it put my friend to sleep...zzzzzzz",Rocky Balboa
389,anzaldua,A last chance for the new generations to root for Rocky!,8,19 January 2007,"When rocky V came out a few years ago I said: ""you got to be kidding"". 5 years after rocky IV, Stallone's character is retired but still willing to fight. Weell, that was in 1990. Last year when I found out that a Rocky VI was about to come I said: ""no way, Stallone really needs the money.I'm writing this just as I arrive from the Theatre and I'm still whistling the Rocky tune, thats right. All the people that came out from the cinema were singing, whistling and even trowing punches.When I sat in my chair I was waiting for something crappy, when the credit for writing and directing appear I knew I was going to see a very bad movie, I could'n have been more mistaken.The story is: you know, a Rocky story. He was remembering those good old days. Well the story is good, as those good old days when the first part of the six-o-logy came out in 1977, thirty years ago. But there is something about the movie that is better than the story itself, the phrases Rocky tells to his boy. Those are worth for writing them down. Those phrases are good to say to your own son even if you are a former two time champion of the world.As we were used to in the Rocky movies the fight is great, fine film-making by Stallone who was as stubborn as his character to film this movie as rocky was to fight a final fight.A film worth seeing, that gave a chance for all the people who were born in 1990 or were to young to see a Rocky movie in those days, to root for the first time for the boxing idol!",Rocky Balboa
390,bowtiecinema,Rocky's back and he's never needed steroids more.,1,21 December 2006,"After seeing this film I'm eagerly awaiting the next rocky film. You know, the one where he's eighty-two, using a walker, has completely lost his hair, needs a diaper, and is still somehow in good enough shape to kick some young whipper-snapper's butt! Now being a film buff, I surprisingly have never seen a previous Rocky film, so I can't comment on it's relation to the other films. All I know is that Sylvester Stalone is no screenwriter, no director, barely an actor, and that he must really like boxing. I found the behind the scenes story of the first Rocky film very interesting. Stalone couldn't sell his script because no one wanted him to act in this film. Some people even offered to buy his script on the basis that he not star in the film. However the Italian Stallion didn't give up in the boxing ring of Hollywood and eventually got his film made. And then he made a sequel and then another sequel and then another sequel and on and on until we got what this film is here. Rocky CXXIV!!! Watching this film I couldn't get over the absurdity of the dialog spoken by every character and the meaningless scenes that filled most of the film. In fact the audience is completely bored and the film doesn't even get to the plot until the third reel (each reel is twenty minutes)! In my opinion this film is the biggest laughing stock of the year. It's not that the editing and/or cinematography is bad, but the most important elements of a film- the acting, directing, writing- all are so terrible and that's what the average movie-goer is looking for a good story. Just like the lead character in the film asks, ""why can't I fight again"", I'm sure Stalone asked, ""why can't I make another Rocky movie""? And the answer to both questions is the same, ""Rocky is too old to believe in!"" It's to the point of pathetic and isn't the slightest bit heartwarming. This is not the true story of what a has been boxer goes through.",Rocky Balboa

The sixth installment of the Rocky series was overall entertaining but nowhere near a masterpiece. Stallone freely admits he wasn't happy with Rocky V and wanted to go out on a better note and I think he did that, This film wraps everything up in a nice bow and I think that's exactly what Stallone wanted. The way this film ends don't expect a Rocky VII. Rocky fans will be happy but left wondering why it took 16 years to finally put a tidy end to the series. This film ranks 4th in my book of the films in the series ahead of Rocky IV and V but still behind the first three.",Rocky Balboa
392,haythalk,Fantastic Finale for Iconic hero!,9,24 January 2007,"When Rocky Balboa was announced, my immediate reaction was: ""Yes!Fantastic!""...I then started to have other thoughts...16 years is an awful long time after Rocky V, that movie flopped, fans didn't like it, how will this will turn out..etc etc...basically i was getting worried. My fears were beginning to go away when i saw the trailers in the summer..i could just sense Sly had done the character proud. And so finally, on Jan 19, i was finally able to complete the saga.The movie is everything a Rocky fan could have wished for. It's an emotional, funny, motivating and above all, a very personal movie. The first half of the film is very reminiscent of the first 2 movies. A gently paced human drama with great character observations. The scenes where Rocky goes to the ice rink, the flat, the pet shop maybe be sentimental but are very powerful and emotional. The characters around Rocky's life are also varied and well acted. These range from his son,Paulie,Marie and even Spider Rico. We get some really funny scenes from Paulie and even Spider comes up with a few funny moments.When Rocky decides to fight again, there are some very well acted scenes from Sly. The pain of losing Adrian, the need to get the hurt out, the feelings of his family/friends all come out.And just like the other Rockys...once the fight is on..the drama subsides and its time for the montage! Duke may not feature as much as I would like BUT he delivers what surely must be one of the best lines in the whole saga - Lets start building some hurtin bombs...Yeah!The fight is shot in HBO style and is directed superbly...lots of colour changes..lots of great slow-mo...real thrilling stuff.The ending was very fitting and in my mind concluded the series perfectly.Of course, there are always a few gripes...but i loved the movie so much, i can't be bothered to discuss them!Sly wanted to give the character a noble end and to give the fans the Rocky film they didn't really get in part V.Yo Sly, you did it!",Rocky Balboa
393,swest2,A true winner,10,19 March 2007,"I was 24 when I saw ""Rocky"" for the first time so I grew up watching and loving ""Rocky"". The characters, casting, settings, costumes, and let us not forget the MUSIC were perfect. To me the movie was a love story that happened to have a fight at the end. It also appealed to men and women. There are so many themes in the movie - love, redemption, family, forgiveness, humor, conviction, character, etc. The Rocky character was so relateable for a lot of people. Every time I watch it I always see something else. To me ""Rocky I"" was a perfect movie. ""Rocky"" was nominated for an Academy Award in an impressive group of movies for best movie in 1976. I watched all the movies nominated, but I watch Rocky repeatedly to this day. I think the Academy got it right that year by giving ""Rocky"" the award for best movie. I still use the old body language to help Rocky in the first fight, and all the subsequent fights.As a die hard Rocky fan, of course, I had to see Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV and Rocky V. I found them all to be enjoyable. However, although there was something in every movie I enjoyed, I felt the ""heart"" of the ongoing story was missing.When I heard that there was to be another Rocky movie, I was curious to see what had happened to ""my old friend"" in the last 16 years. (I think a lot of people think of Rocky as a friend because as far as I know this is the first time a character had been presented in ""real time"" over a span of 30 years.) Since my son works at a theater, I can watch movies for free whenever I want so over the course of last year, I saw a LOT of free movies. I saw ""Rocky Balboa"" on December 20 and hands down ""Rocky Balboa"" was the best movie for me in 2006 by far. I loved it so much I even paid to see it several time at another theater. I even made a point to recommend this movie to every body I came in contact with it.The ""heart"" of the movie/story was back. This was the Rocky I fell in love with. This is a ""rich"" movie, great from beginning to end. This is how movies are suppose to be, they are to touch you, make you think and feel. You are suppose to talk about movies like this, analyze them because you have a vested interest as a viewer and you care about these characters.SPOILERS: I cried at Rocky's heart ache at the loss of his wife. I felt his hurt and confusion over the relationship with his son --as if he (Rocky) had done something wrong when all he had done was love his son unconditionally. I felt his loneliness. I laughed at his bad jokes and puns. I saw his attempts at ""flirting"" (albeit unconsciously) with Little Marie using some of the techniques he used with Adrian. I appreciated the fact that Little Marie was a lot like Adrian - shy, quiet, always in Rocky's corner. She became his touchstone when he was contemplating fighting again because her opinion (like Adrian's) matter to him. I also liked the fact that since Marie had life experience, she was mature enough not to be intimidated by Rocky's love for Adrian and that she appreciated his feelings for her (Adrian). I think since Rocky had a big heart, he could, in time, probably find room in it for someone else. Besides who isn't a sucker for a man who loves animals. Let us not forget his relationship with Paulie which has always been odd to me.I like the fact that not only were some of the characters back (Spider Rico, Duke, Little Marie, etc.) but some of the references from the other movies were worked in. Some of the dialog was a twist of dialog from the other movies -- which is something you do in real life, you reference events, conversations, stories, people, etc. Very real, true to life.This was a great final chapter for Rocky and I will miss him. You just know that for the rest of his life Rocky is going to be okay because he has the love of his family and friends and was, is and always will be a fighter and, more importantly, a TRUE WINNER. Again, for me, this was a love story with a fight at the end.",Rocky Balboa

But for us old horses that grew up in the 70s and the 80s, seeing this movie was like a return to innocence. Rocky, Paulie and the old horses standing their ground for a last fight. The characters are just as wonderful as any of the Rocky movies (even Rocky V had some redeeming character development moments) and Sly performs better than any movie he's been into in the last 10 years. We see real drama in this film!

The dialogue is human, the acting for the best part is extremely good and the overall pace of the movie is just right.After the devastating fallout from Rocky V settled, I personally thought Rocky Balboa was going to be a cash-in that sent this series to the grave. How wrong I was. Some 20 years after watching the first instalment, I still found myself screaming at the screen and willing Rocky on with as much enthusiasm as ever.If you're old enough to remember the original Rocky, you will be in tears of joy after this - if you're not old enough, then it's a taste of what made the original such a resounding success.I felt a genuine sense of pride after watching this - Stallone has redeemed this series above and beyond anything you might expect and it's a testament to the premise that a good story doesn't go down without a fight.Rocky Balboa, or Rocky VI as some would have it, is the best since Rocky II - perhaps better. At times flawed, drawn out and full of nostalgia - but hell, you'll feel so good after this it wont matter a bit.Get ready to be surprised, this one is a knockout.7.4 / 10",Rocky Balboa
397,schwannomin,boomers get over yourselves (spoiler),3,8 January 2007,"I spent 14 hours Saturday with lots of friends and lots of beer watching the entire Rocky saga from I-V at my friend's place ending the day at the theater for Rocky Balboa. Yeah, we watched V in spite of Stallone acting like it never existed in Rocky Balboa. None the less, we heard great things about Balboa. I thought perhaps, just perhaps, Stallone had something left in his writing. Basically, what he gave us is a big ""You're still valid"" to the 50+ set. WHY, WHY did we have to watch a 60-year-old man fight to a decision with an actual boxer? Let me take that back. If he fights to the decision, he has to die at the end. His death shows that while you cannot do all the things you did at 25, you can at least go out doing what you love. The entire movie was leading up to that death-by-boxing ending. He's constantly depressed and haunted by the ghost of his wife. He is a successful restaurant owner who is not happy because he's living in the past. He wants to relive his glory. Death-by-boxing is exactly the way the Rocky I always knew was going out. Boxing, like life, has an ending. It stinks that that's true for all of us. We all know it's hard to produce any big budget entertainment that tells baby boomers that, but that's life. That's reality. I'm tired of seeing 60-year-old men acting out fantasies the boomers have of some late life resurgence. I don't want to see Naomi Judd on the Today show after several face lifts telling us we'll live forever. 60 is the new 30. NO IT ISN'T! 60 is 60. It stinks. You're body does fall apart. And if Sugar Ray Leonard got in the ring with Floyd Mayweather Jr., he'd be killed. Actually killed. The Rocky we fell in love with throughout the 70's and 80's wanted to die in the ring. It was his love, just after Adrian. Since she's dead, he had to go meet her performing what he was born to do. This movie was a cop out. Baby boomers, your time is coming soon. Like it or not.",Rocky Balboa
398,aparup908,Best in the series,8,9 March 2020,"Unlike the revered first part, this movie is not just a David & Goliath story. A movie about a player coming out of retirement, at the age of 50, could have gone wrong in many ways given the track record of the latter movies in the franchise, but instead this has better action, direction and gives a sense of closure to fans of Rocky movies.
The movie is not inconsistent, which was the issue with the previous Rocky movies. The plot is intriguing right from the beginning. It is slightly better than Creed I. Creed showed the unintentional funny side of Balboa, but Rocky Balboa has more gravitas to it and is the most inspirational of all.",Rocky Balboa
399,rterrell2,I had a good time,7,19 December 2006,"I just got home from screening Rocky Balboa and I must say I liked it a lot. It was not the greatest film ever made but what is anymore. The sixth entry in a franchise that should be dead after the fifth one, should be crap. But it is for from that and Sly's passion can be seen all over this flick. Being a major fan of his it has been hard to watch his career go down the tubes. He is very underrated and belongs in better flicks than the straight to video action crap he has been doing. He has given us some great flicks in his day and I think he has some left in him.Any major Rocky fan owes it to themselves and to Sly himself to check out this film this week. It is much better than a lot of the crap out right now and just uplifting to no end. it's got the feel of the original and a lot of the heart.",Rocky Balboa

Just as the first film in the Rocky series, Sylvester Stallone has worked hard to create his vision, and the end result is that this legend of the cinema is once again fulfilled. For Rocky fans especially, this is as he (Stallone) stated, a love letter to those who have backed the character.Much like Rocky I, II, and V, this film is a drama - character and story driven, with a solid script, and a captivating story. There are strong performances by everyone, with Stallone in particular, as talented as he was in the first film. Furthermore, the story is actually stand-alone, though it helps to know the character prior to this film. Aside from that, the scenes of boxing are remarkably well-done, and the classic music of the series returns and pulls the heart-strings at all the right moments.I don't want to tell any of the actual story here, but don't listen to anyone who says this is ""just another Rocky"". Fear, depression, growing old, loss, love, family, hope and redemption are covered here with unmatched dignity. Stallone himself is an underdog in Hollywood, but this film will stand up to all criticizers and just like the Italian Stallion, the man, say ""I am.""",Rocky Balboa

402,dimlim77,Much better than the last but lacks something extra,8,23 December 2006,"I must have seen every rocky at least 4 or 5 times. I am addicted to them. They are the perfect movie for anyone who loves the underdog and loves watching movies that make you feel energized. Rocky Balboa was definitely a movie that tried to accomplish that and for the most part it did.I know that Talia Shire and Stallone both agreed that she did not want and should not have been in the film but the tributes to her throughout the film were very well done. Rocky even stays loyal to her despite having much interest from and towards little Marie. That was a nice touch.There are a few reasons why i did not give this movie a perfect rating (based on rocky movies of course and not movies in general). One major hole that everyone remembers is that in Rocky V, we find out that Rocky has brain damage suffered from years of abuse in the ring. In Rocky Balboa he clears all his medical tests and they give him a license to box...come on. An other slight problem is that the training montage was slightly too short for my own personal tastes but on that point...to each his own. Finally the final fight completely lacked the Rocky magic of all of his previous fights. They filmed it as if it was a real fight on HBO and personally, it did not work. I felt it was badly choreographed as well but perhaps some people like both aspects.Those minor problems aside, I did enjoy this one. The acting was surprisingly good, from everyone in the movie. The ending was a very good one because it was truly believable. Plus I was convinced that he would kill himself off in this one but thank God he did not.great movie for all Rocky fans!",Rocky Balboa

405,rlwjr-68970,The speech!,10,16 May 2021,Rocky Balboa is a beautiful heartbreaking masterpiece. His speech to Robert in the street is one of the greatest I've ever heard. The raw emotion in this movie is simply unrivaled. He had a once in a lifetime love and losing her was earth shattering for him and you feel that pain deep in your soul. Stallone was absolutely brilliant and I truly believe it is his finest acting performance. I felt the sense of loss and loneliness so deeply that it was as if we had all lost her. It made me hug my own wife just a little tighter.,Rocky Balboa

It's a piece of whimsical, illogical overblown nonsense. The notion that a seedy over-50s man who used to be a boxer twenty years earlier, could last ten minutes, let alone ten rounds, with the heavyweight champion of the world is just too preposterous for words. Now if Stallone had written a film in which Rocky is flattened within a minute of entering the ring and is carried off to hospital it would not only have been realistic but would have given the writer/director a unique opportunity to explore the effect that this type of humiliation would have on his character. As a result, we might have ended up with a remarkable human drama instead of another dreary, uninteresting and completely unbelievable sports film.",Rocky Balboa

Back then in 1987, when I left the city I lived for the past 8 years, there was a family who were a friend of my family. This husband and wife got a baby daughter whom I used to carry around. Not long ago, I met this family again in the city where I live now and guess what? That baby I used to carry around had become a mother of a baby girl. And now I carry her daughter around.And I am still unmarried yet.I had a good time watching Rocky Balboa, brings back old memories. The first time I watched Rocky is when he fought that big Russian guy (Dolf Lundgren) in Rocky IV and then I watched the rest of Rocky movies in backwards succession (III then II then I). Then came Rocky V which was not very satisfying, and now this Rocky Balboa as a finale.Good ending. Gonna fly now!",Rocky Balboa
408,rhinestone_cowgirl,As good as the first....,10,2 January 2007,"I, like most of my friends, was a little wary when hearing Stallone was making yet another Rocky film, but I could not have had less to worry about.Stallone is fascinating, he's got this wonderful ability to emote almost silently that has been glossed over in many of his ""shoot em up"" features. He totally and completely blew me away. His performance is so real and raw, I'm sure it will be a testament to the politics of the academy when he is passed over for an Oscar nomination, in that, he joins a thousand other unforgettable performances.As for the story, as my mother said, it made her laugh and cry, so she gave it a thumbs up. But more than that it makes you want to fly out of your seat and scream for Rocky, cheer him on. (and this is coming from someone who refuses to watch organized sports). I have never been so fully enveloped in a film that felt so substantial, so real. A thousand standing ovations for Stallone, and a huge pat on the back for whoever took the chance on this last Rocky film, please, please go see it, it's proof that sometimes wonderful, meaningful movies do get made.",Rocky Balboa

It's hardly Stallone's best work. But, that's not the point. Stallone made this film for himself, as a labor of love, and for the all the people who've ever yelled ""Yo Adrian!"" It's a very touching and appropriate tribute to Rocky and his fans. It properly and effectively brings to a close a legacy that will forever live in the hearts of movie fans, sports fans, Stallone fans, and Americans alike.The film is peppered with nostalgic iconography from all Rocky history. From his now-grown turtles, ""Cuff"" & ""Link"", to a character cameo from ""Spider Rico"", the first ""bum"" we ever saw Rocky knock out.Stallone is as true to his career character as ever. He's funny, sweet and endearing...yet still the toughest s.o.b. on celluloid.What else can I say? It's Christmas...it's Rocky...what more could anyone ask?

410,stonecoldmark,Great final chapter for one of films greatest underdogs,8,21 December 2006,"Wow! This was a surprisingly good final installment of one of films greatest characters. It's a fitting ending to a great series (except V).The movie is paced a lot like the 1st one. We get to see where the former 2 time Heavyweight Champion of the World has gone. I enjoyed the slow build to the fight. You needed significant time to cover what has gone on with Rocky, in the 16 or so years since we have seen him last.The story is truly believable and even the fight has a ""real life"" feel to it. The first 2 rounds are shot is what appears to be real time. The fight seems more real than past Rocky fights. Taking nothing away from those awesome fights. The signature music during the training is still there and anything that made past Rocky movies great are all here to make this a very enjoyable film.Rocky Balboa shows a lot of heart, and emotion in this film, and of course you want to cheer for the guy. At the very core I am 34 and I ran to the theater to see a ""Rocky"" film like I did all those years ago. I was excited and giddy like a kid again. I was not disappointed and Stallone to be praised for ending this chapter with the dignity and grace that Rocky himself deserves. It's a tremendous cap of a great career for both star and character. Rocky will indeed stand the test of time.",Rocky Balboa
411,lanzig138,Quite Simply The Most Enjoyable And Moving Film Of The Year,10,21 December 2006,"It really irks the s**t out of me when people refer to the original 'Rocky' as a ""sports"" movie. It's not. Boxing is used a a metaphor in that film . Basically what I'm saying is put yourself in Rocky's shoes, replace boxing with whatever your dream is (or was) and that's what the spirit of 'Rocky' is all about. It's the story of an underdog (I'm sorry to use that word because I know it's been beaten to death this week but honestly no other word fits) who overcomes all the obstacles facing him to have his moment in the sun. It's an endearing classic with a timeless and simple message. Don't ever give up. 'Rocky Balboa' starts off on the same note as the original did. Rocky has fallen back to square one. His boxing career is over and he now owns and manages a restaurant named after his beloved late wife, Adrian. That's right she dies and no spoiler warning is needed because it has been made public in every newspaper and magazine I've read in the past three months. Rocky is pretty lonely and his relationship with his son(Ventimiglia),who has chosen to go in the opposite direction of his father by climbing the corporate ladder, is not good. One thing Rocky still has is his brother in law, Paulie, played by living god Burt Young. True story: Young is the only person I have ever been too intimidated by to go up to at a horror convention. He smiled at me and I smiled at him but I was just too damn nervous to approach him. Anyway getting back to the movie, Young rocks this movie. He gets the best lines in the film. Example: Stallone takes Young to the ice skating rink where he and Adrian shared their first date. The rink has since been torn down and the mangled pieces of it look depressing. Rocky starts to wax nostalgic about the connection he felt with her that night. Young, who can't take much more of Rocky's wallowing since her death snaps out with what I thought was the funniest line of the year.........""Ice is stupid! People standing on ice are more stupid!"" In addition to his hilarious one liners, Young also shares some of the most moving and tear jerking moments of this film with Stallone.Young clearly deserves a supporting Oscar nod for his role though I doubt he will get one do to the snottiness of the current Academy members.Moving along, Rocky also develops a very sweet friendship with a bartender named ""Little Marie"" (played by Geraldine Hughes). What's great about this relationship is that is does not go the predictable root and develop into a romance. It's more of a father/daughter thing and it works beautifully.Okay so one night ESPN pits Rocky against the current lightweight champion, Mason Dixon(Tarver), in a computerized/televised fight. The simulated fight sparks interest in the now has been Balboa. Dixon is looking for a challenge himself due to the fact that he seems to knock all of his competitors out in the first round. He has become bored a a tad bit lazy with the sport. An exhibition match is arranged between these two. Not only does Rocky have to get his body back in shape but he has to deal with backlash he's going to receive from pretty much everyone about being ""too old"". The underdog story now transforms into a fight against ageism (and could it be anymore timely with America's increasingly alarming and disturbing obsession with youth?)The night of the big fight comes and Stallone does some great work with photography and choreography here. Actually, I think this film contains some of the most satisfying fight sequences I've seen since 'Raging Bull'. The blows look gritty and real, no CGI, no bullshit. As for the ending, this is not an M. Night Shyamalan film. It does not take a rocket scientist to know that there are only two possible endings this film could have. Stallone chose the right one. Trust me you won't be disappointed. I wept like a bitch and if you are a fan of the series you probably will too. Speaking of Stallone, this is the best performance he's given in quite some time. He deserves an Oscar nod too but probably won't get one either for reasons I have already mentioned. Before I end this review I would like to talk about the end credits. As the 'Rocky' theme music blares we are treated to the sight of Philadelphians of all ages running up the art museum stairs and doing their little Rocky dance. I found it cool as hell for these homages to be put in the film. I am from Philadelphia and my friend and I use to run up those stairs all the time back in the day. The best time to do it was at night. When we got to the top we would just sit down at stare at the city. Philadelphia is a gross and dirty city but it sure did look beautiful up there at night.'Rocky Balboa' is by far my favorite film of the year.",Rocky Balboa

After 1 hour and 42 minutes, I got that and more. I truly believe this was Stallone's best performance of his career. In my mind, this movie was a modern version of Rocky 1. I didn't go into it expecting it to be about fighting, but more about Rocky's life, and his moving on in his life past boxing, and past the death of his wife. His speeches in this movie gave me goosebumps, and he once again showed that at 60, he can play Rocky as well as he did 30 years ago. Anyways, this movie had dialogue, supporting cast(including a good performance by Tarver), and the traditional Rocky music. The ONLY problem I had was that they didn't play Eye of the Tiger, but that's OK. This is a must see for everybody and I will be among the first to get the DVD when it comes out!",Rocky Balboa

Some would argue that the beginning of the film just takes you back to the same familliar material of the first films but I personally felt it gave you the understanding of what was going on in Rocky's psyche. He's lonely and he's still living in the past when Adrian was alive, but he needs to move on. He needs one more fight, not just because it's what he loves doing but for him to release the grief, pain and sadness he'd been carrying for some time. Another great performance by Burt Young as Paulie, Geraldine Hughes as little Marie, and Milo Vintimiglia as Robert, Rocky's son.",Rocky Balboa
414,newfunk-2,"Welcome back, Rocky (and Stallone!)",8,21 December 2006,"What really impressed me about the story is how art reflected life. The odds were against a SIXTH Rocky film succeeding, much as many characters in the film are dismissive of Balboa's bid for one more fight. Stallone has always been smarter than the characters he plays, and it shows in his witty and poignant script for this movie. Like the character he was born to play, Stallone gives it his all in several key dramatic scenes. There's also quite a bit of humor (much of it self-deprecating). Only the most cynical moviegoers won't be cheering for the Big Guy by the time this one's over.No one expects to see another Rocky movie after this one. It's a fine send-off for a classic character.",Rocky Balboa

For the first hour or so it works clips of the original in to the new movie to the point of being vastly over-self referential.The movie deals with Rocky's burning grief for his dead wife, and how he exorcises that grief through, guess what, more fighting!I can understand the premise - but it all seems too easy. Rocky fights the world champion - surprisingly doesn't get totally destroyed and then proclaims that 'the beast' (his destructive feelings of grief) has gone.Unbelievable mawkish tripe. The big fight itself is poorly choreographed and suspension of disbelief was virtually impossible.The various narrative devices used - the computer simulated fight, Rocky's son's distance, the poorly judged 'romance', et al.; never come to fruition in the story - simply providing impetus to get to the big fight.Rocky's 'powerful' speeches are full of 'ordinary guy' bluster, but lack substance.Watch the original Rocky - it's a superb movie.

The scene where Rocky lets his heart out in front of Paulie in the meat-packing room was emotional. Also, the speech given by Rocky to the boxing license officials and to his son were great. They could have shown more training footage, but nonetheless Stallone at 60 was in great shape. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD next year in April or May.

418,guirunkaryyk,Rocky is back on top...,10,20 December 2006,"I went into this movie really wanting to like it, especially after the less than stellar Rocky V left the franchise in a place it shouldn't have been. Fortunately for me and everyone else, Sylvester Stallone has come through in a huge way, creating a film that thoroughly involves the viewer and has you rooting for the aging champion, just as you did in its predecessors. The use of flashbacks and cameos are key (I especially liked Spider Rico's inclusion), and really take you back to the humble beginnings of the original Rocky.Everything is character-driven here, and the cast delivers. Stallone's performance is impressive (especially when you consider how he is often unfairly ridiculed), Burt Young is as great as ever as Paulie, and Tony Burton (Duke, Rocky's trainer) is as energizing as ever. New cast members Geraldine Hughes and Milo Ventimiglia also turn in convincing performances of characters you're vaguely familiar with, but who have grown up an awful lot since you last saw them. Finally, Antonio Tarver also turns in an adequate performance as the champion who has in a way lost his own ""Eye of the Tiger"" and learns what he's made of by the aging Champion and comes to respect him.If you'll give Stallone and this film a chance, you'll be entertained. Stallone shows that he still has the heart and ability to make an engaging motion picture, and in that regard, his achievement with this film closely mirrors that of the Rocky Balboa character. When it comes to Stallone, critics and comics abound, but this should silence them, at least for a time. If you have to give credit where it's due, it's time Stallone got his. Whether this happens remains to be seen, but for fans of Stallone, Rocky, and honestly, film as entertainment in general, you'll have to agree that Rocky is indeed, back on top...",Rocky Balboa

Stallone directs and performs in one of his best Rocky films with a strong storyline and some of the best fight scenes of any of his movies.The story line has some interesting and complex elements, including Rocky struggling with what is motivating him to return to the ring and his son struggling to find his own identify under the 'shadow' of his father's success.The dialog in the film is quite tight and there are a number of moving scenes where Rocky talks about what it means to pursue his goals and the sacrifices it takes to accomplish your goals. However, if you're looking decent, hard hitting action this movie has it too. If you watch HBO Boxing (and I do) you'll feel like your watching a Pay Per View fight right down to commentators like Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman calling the blow-by-blow action.This is a slightly more introspective film that some of the original Rocky's but this fits Stallone's age. One of the most impressive elements of the movie is the tremendous shape that Stallone is in considering he must be almost 60!

So before going to see Rocky Balboa, I read many of the comments here on IMDb both good and bad and really didn't know what to expect but decided to spend the money to see if it was as good as the ratings on IMDb indicated. It seems that people either loved it, or hated it and most loved it. While I gave this movie the highest rating, I am not going to say that it's the best movie I have ever seen. I am not even sure I would say it's the best Rocky movie but after having seen it tonight I have to say I it is up there with the better ones. And I would like just give Sly credit in that he closes out the character and the series with grace and dignity that it deserves. Something that was seriously lacking from the later films.The story of Rocky Balboa comes full circle. It's the story of life and how things change. The most striking part of the film for me was when he returns to where the roller rink was where he had his date with Adrian. It's been torn down and is just a pile. It seems to symbolize how the past gets torn down to make way for the future and sometimes that is a bitter pill to swallow. I've had the same feelings when visiting places in my life that have changed over the years. I like how Sly brings the character to grips with the present and with change and that living your life in the present is what it's all about.If you liked the Rocky character, I recommend you see this film. I think you will come away with a good feeling about the series as a whole.",Rocky Balboa
425,zzmasta,A Lovely Surprise,9,20 December 2006,"9/10 for the greatest Rocky since the first.""Rocky Balboa"" touches on the emotional side of the two-time former champ. With his wife dead and his estranged son pushing away from him, Rocky is slowly finding his life is becoming empty. Current champion Mason Dixon is undefeated and hated by the public because all of his fights are against duds, and he hasn't had a real challenge yet. See where this is going? Rocky is searching for something in his life. A computer simulation ran a test between Rocky in his prime and Dixon, and showed that Rocky would win . Controversy begins, as people differ in opinion. Rocky wants to start fighting again, though he mentions ""Small time, local"" we all know there's no room for small time in this final bout.So an exhibition match is scheduled between Dixon and Balboa. We get the classic training scenes, the wildly famous Rocky theme and Stallone showing us what he's got left.My only complaints where that the things that everyone looked forward to in this film - the training and fighting - were a bit short in comparison to the introduction where Balboa is seen going to his wife's grave several times. Stallone as director wanted to emphasize the emotional state of Rocky - he did not want this to be about just winning. It got through, but I think it overshadows the exciting and explosive nature that we all paid admission price to see. If anything, extend the training scenes a bit more.The fight was excellently done in my opinion. It was filmed during a real boxing match - hence lots of people in the audience commented on how similar it looked when watching a boxing match on TV. Only unrealistic parts where that both fighters beat the hell out of each other practically every round, which doesn't happen but this is Rocky. This is what we came to see.I don't often cheer at a movie, and I don't think many of you do either. But as soon as the letters ""Rocky Balboa"" came on the screen in large gold, appearing one last time, the audience gave it the applause it deserved.Well done Stallone.

426,weingartena-819-142661,Really Good Drama,9,1 September 2018,"I wasn't expecting to like this film when I finally caught up with it on TV: I was very pleasantly surprised! I probably liked it better than all the previous Rocky films. The reason is simple: it is not really a ""boxing"" film per-se, it is about relationships between people, who - for the greater part - are dazed and confused. Rocky himself allows himself to be swept into a match that he knows full well he shouldn't be performing. Without giving away the ending - I liked the ending: both protagonists are dazed and confused. I rated this movie 9/10, I should probably be giving it more.",Rocky Balboa
427,grantmalf,A brilliant film that is a fitting finale to a hero.....,10,18 February 2007,"WARNING SPOILERS Its been just over 24 hours since I had the privilege of attending the Australian premiere of Rocky Balboa at the open air cinema in Sydneyand I'm still reeling.Is it the fact that I got to ever so briefly meet Sylvester Stallone, an idol of mine since childhood, that is the reason I'm still buzzing, or is it the fact that his latest offering his by far his best work in years, possibly ever? Perhaps it's a bit of both. But despite the obvious bias created by the crowd, and the creative force behind the movie being in attendance, Rocky Balboa is still a stunning movie.What Stallone has done so perfectly in this film is capture the essence and the magic of the original character and story that he first did over 30 years ago. The themes that made the first film so special are once again present here; Courage, will, determination, and spirit in the face of insurmountable odds is not a new or novel theme, but is compelling and moving in this film. Added to those themes here is the loss of Rocky's one love and pillar of strength; Adrian, and the emptiness of aging, and being perceived as nothing more than a relic or has been.Stallone manages for the first time in years to present his story with humility and honesty in his writing and direction, as well as genuine passion and even an off beat humour in his performance. It truly is the best acting of his career together with Copland and of course the first Rocky. One thing is certain. The magic is back.As mentioned before, it is the brutally honest approach to the story that makes it successful. In contrast to the machine like, cartoonish villains of Rocky III, IV, and V (whom I still love and are brilliant entertainment) Balboa faces two enemies in this film, one is the opponent he actually fights: Mason ""the line"" Dixon who retains the humanity and vulnerability of Apollo Creed, and the other is life itself; particularly the doubts, weaknesses and disappointments that fill everyday. Where the Rocky story is unique in this film and in the very first is that the overall theme is not victory, but is self efficacy; taking the opportunity to fulfil ones own potential even if the result is a foregone conclusion.The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Burt Young who shares a great deal of screen time with Stallone and is amazing in all of it. The inevitable training sequence felt short, but was as rousing as ever, almost bringing the crowd into hysterics as he climbed the steps in Philly one last time.Finally, the fight is presented in true pay per view ESPN style that really manages to capture some of the reality that made Balboa's first battle with Creed so special. The fight itself is possibly the most believable of the whole franchise. The punches aren't supported by gargantuan sound effects, but with the realistic thud of actual body contact, and the choreography to its credit even manages to capture the scrappy realism of actual boxing. At the end of the 2nd round however, Bill Conte's rousing score kicks in, as does some inspired direction from Stallone and the fight is elevated to the battle that every Rocky fan loves to see.I'm sure I could say more..but in all honesty I could never say enough. This is the most essential sequel I've ever seen that nobody thought needed to be made. Never again will the sixth instalment of a film franchise come along and almost retain the power of the first. The mere premise of the film seemed laughable, but in his infinite wisdom and intelligence, Stallone turned those doubts and reservations into the core of the movie. In doing so he has once and for all created a fitting ending for a heroic, yet human character that in some way is a part of all of us.",Rocky Balboa
428,joshzancan,"Remember that feeling you got watchin' Rocky when you were younger? Yeah, it's back.",10,20 December 2006,"i cant put this movie into words. it was dramatic when appropriate, comedic when appropriate, and even corny when appropriate. it wasn't ""cheesy"" corny, but amusing corny. example, when rocky starts training, he goes running...well he takes his dog with him on a leash, also wearing the gray sweatshirt. corny? yeah, but it was still sorta funny. there were times when the movie took itself seriously, which is how it started off, with rocky over-coming personal issues, which was demonstrated very well by the Stallone, with acting, writing, and directing all on account. however, the mood was lifted a bit by a slight, sarcastic comedic relief--the great Burt Young as Paulie. he was funny, likable, all while still being a bit mean and surly. and he didn't get annoying as i thought he did in the past.the best thing about this film though, was that it wasn't about boxing, it was about the characters. thats how the first Rocky was. come Rocky 5, however, it was all about fighting and the movie, in my opinion, was awful. i wasn't sure what to think of a 6th film, but it definitely went back to its roots, and it was a movie about certain characters, whose lives were set in the sport of boxing, and not a movie just about boxing and the people who got beat up during the fights. awesome, awesome film. probably my favorite Rocky (although, i'll admit, i haven't seen the first one in forever haha).",Rocky Balboa

432,naqvifaheem,Fantastic JOB... Thanks you Mr. Stallone,10,11 January 2007,"WoW... Just saw this movie and it was Awesome...I've only seen Rocky series till Rocky-3. and liked the first part very much as despite of fact the lead character becomes American Hero but his rise and enthusiasm is what we people in third world country sees a lot..It was not about some DREAM come true it was all about RESPECT and thats what excellent in it.. see He was a fighter with some abilities and was alone so his life was passing-by, I didn't see any ambition in the first movie for Rocky to become World Champion all I see that he wanted to Get Respect , get people seeing his point of views etc etc Now just leave what happen after wards in this film.. the Old Rocky is again the same Man,.. Glory days over .. wife died of cancer.. Son grown up and Life of his own... pretty much just going through with life .. than again the RESPECT thing just comes up and he got determined to go to ring in his late 50's and face new heavy weight champion...The movie is great struggle for RESPECT of elderly hero and is motivating enough to neglect that line ""Come-one 60 year old in SHORTS taking over young champ..."" recommended to everyone who wanted to Prove themselves After a long time I've seen Stallone doing some real acting... and no nomination in golden globe , Oscar for acting, writing or direction is surprise for me as this movie is much much greater than Borat.. is in line with Departed and The Queen... Come-one guys you gave Capote Oscar last year.. didn't this movie is better than that one.. i term of forbidden choices and struggle etc etc etcfrom many things I learned from this and earlier movies one line to sum-up ""If you want something badly just release your inner demon and get it....there's nothing impossible..""",Rocky Balboa
433,sevenyearhawk,Pleasantly surprised,8,25 December 2006,"I am not a big fan of Sly Stallone, I can't recall having seen even one Rocky movie in its entirety. This said, the previews and early reviews of this movie intrigued me. In particular the father/son elements in this movie. I've never had a particularly strong bond with my father, but he IS a big Stallone/ Rocky/Rambo fan, and being the Holidays, I figured what the heck! Because I am not fluent in the Rocky mythology, I definitely came into this with fresh eyes ... The movie pacing was great, I enjoyed the flashbacks, Rocky's reminiscing didn't bore me, in fact it was essential for my understanding.All in all, my dad and I shared shed tears, and this film made me want watch the previous installments (as well as try to run some stairs and drink raw eggs, yuk!)",Rocky Balboa

I went and saw it Christmas Day 2006 with my father and sister. My father had seen the first Rocky back in 1976 and loved it. The new Rocky had that same emotion like the first one. People were in the theater making fun of Rocky saying, ""Oh, so when is Rocky XIX coming out?!"" ""Come on you old man!"" But I think anybody who liked the story and could relate to it would actually walk out of the theater and say, "" That was a darn good movie"" It had a lot of the silent sort of scenes where that early morning Philadelphia song would come in.

435,Giuffra316,A fitting ending to the Rocky series,7,21 December 2006,"Going back to a formula similar to that of the first one, Rocky Balboa is a fitting end to one of the most popular movie series of all time. If you are seeing this movie, you have an idea of what the movie is centered around. The ending was a fitting way to bring this story to an end and was done in a realistic manner rather than leaving you sitting there in disbelief wondering what the writer and director were thinking. Sylvester Stallone and Burt Ward did a great job reprising their old characters. While the old elements were there, the story also allowed them to evolve and not be stuck completely in their character traits of the past. Most of the time, a sequel or a long awaited conclusion to a series most people thought was done is just a way to capitalize on name power and while a lot of people wouldn't see this if it wasn't for the previous movies, it is also a movie that can stand on its own and doesn't make us regret throwing out our hard earned money on it. And people who may have never seen the previous movies can still follow this one and not be lost. Congrats to Sylvester Stallone for bringing this series to a believable, acceptable and wonderful ending.",Rocky Balboa
436,pksoze22,Rocky is Back,8,28 December 2006,"As a Rocky fan this character has always been dear to my heart. When I was a kid Rocky IV was on & I loved the fights. As I grew older I began to appreciate the other movies and heart that went into the first two.Now we get to Rocky Balboa.... a movie that puts Rocky in the ring 20 years after his epic clash with Drago.We see Rocky as a somewhat successful older man who isn't quiet happy with his lot in life. The warrior burns within. When espn runs a computer simulation it gets people curious about Rocky again. And sure enough Rocky is back to where he was in part one... being offered a fight with the Heavyweight champion of the world while the world is in disbelief.Many media pundits & fans in real life think the movie would be a joke & Stallone wisely uses that. He has commentators, the boxing commission, and even his son question his sanity for fighting at this age. And when we get to the fight his age isn't ignored. The champ makes Rocky look bad until Balboa gets a break & capitalizes on it.The movie however isn't just about fighting its the end of an emotional journey with a man even cynics can grudgingly embrace. Rocky has become tempered with age but doesn't put up with the bs of our age. Rocky proves his critics wrong in & outside the ring and we all remember why we cared in the first place.",Rocky Balboa
437,tmchacko,Best of the Series -- A Heartwarming Final Reunion With an Old Friend!,10,20 February 2007,"Sylvester Stallone's training regimen for this film may have included toughening his hide against possible ridicule from critics and public alike. After all, the current crop of young filmgoers might only know him for ""Spy Kids 3-D"" and his short-lived reality TV series, ""The Contender."" And after the collapse of his men's magazine, SLY, and the failure of his fabulous exercise book, SLY MOVES, to hit the best-seller lists, he was in need of a lift.The Sly Fox (all of 60) is back, I'm happy to say, putting his heart, soul, and every bit of his physical prowess into ROCKY BALBOA, the sixth, final, and best film of the series. Stallone has now brought his best-loved character to a graceful retirement. Sixteen years after ROCKY V, Stallone is refusing to allow that inane, incoherent mess to serve as the last word on his very personal creation. Stallone has matured as a filmmaker, offering the most tightly-controlled, heartfelt film since the original. He also applies this maturity to his portrayal of Rocky Balboa: smooth but not smug, likable but not cute, sympathetic but not maudlin. He brings with him an excellent supporting cast. Certainly this film stands head-and-shoulders above ROCKY IV, a desperate, hastily-made homage to the dime-store patriotism of the Reagan years (complete with an ugly ""Russian"" opponent).Having been fleeced of his fortune by crooked accountants (in the previous film), Rocky has returned to his roots in a rundown part of Philadelphia. He has, in the interim, lost his beloved wife Adrian to ""woman's cancer"" and opened a restaurant. (""Adrian's,"" what else?) His son (Milo Ventimiglia) clambers for a foothold in the corporate world, while his insecurities compel him to keep his father at arm's length. Burt Young returns as Paulie, Rocky's cynical brother-in-law, saddled with guilt about his late sister but always supportive of Rocky.As Rocky struggles to make ends meet and manage his grief, the boxing world has moved on to ESPN, HBO/Pay-per-View, snottier, know-it-all commentators and, most significantly ... computer animation! The reigning heavyweight champion, the marvellously-named Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (real-life boxer Antonio Tarver), is not the one-dimensional villain of previous contests: neither the angry sadist of III, nor the giant Marvel Comics automaton of IV. Despite his success, he has yet to earn respect on the level of say, a Rocky Balboa. Even his managers are tired of his petulant, chip-on-the-shoulder attitude, as they make clear in a superbly played scene. Go easy on the old guy, Dixon is advised -- it still means a fatter paycheck, bigger crowds, greater prestige, and finally, respect just by being linked with the name Balboa. ""You're one crazy old man!"" he tells Rocky, who replies, ""You'll get there."" Rocky's charm hasn't diminished with age. He develops a pleasant friendship with a young single mother -- nicely played by Irish actress Geraldine Hughes -- and reaches out to her grown son (James Francis Kelly III). He even gives new life to a scruffy, abandoned mutt -- subsequently named Punchy -- who ends up accompanying Rocky on his training runs. His restaurant is filled with boxing mementos, while the customers are regaled with anecdotes of the good old days.My quibbles with the film are minor: firstly, the lack of a proper reunion scene with Tony Burton (veteran of the earlier films), who plays Duke, Rocky's trainer. He appears suddenly for the press conference, and then for the training montage. Perhaps some scenes were cut by the studio; regardless, Burton deserved a bigger role. Secondly, I might have done with one less flashback or photograph of Talia Shire, as Adrian. And finally, even two seconds of Mike Tyson is too much!Clark Mathis's cinematography captures the grittier, no-frills quality of Rocky's current life, casting aside the comic book colours perfectly suited to ROCKY IV. Bill Conti's original score returns to stir the blood and quicken the pulse, especially when the well-known theme ""Gonna Fly Now"" flies out over the training sequence. Some of my fellow filmgoers were groaning, too, watching Stallone strain against those Olympic-sized barbells! (There's a flash of Rocky's ""nutritional"" preparation, inspired by the first film.) The match is tough and realistic but not overly graphic, presented as an authentic HBO/PPV event set against the glitz of Las Vegas. In fact, it is one of the best boxing sequences ever created for film, without excessive slow-motion shots and leaden 1980s sound effects being shoved down your throat. The conclusion is dignified and credible, as is the film overall, absolutely uplifting for those of us in the 50-plus range! Even the end credits are fun to watch, a fond ""Thank You"" from Sylvester Stallone to his fans. As Rocky takes his final bow, only the hard-of-heart could refuse to cheer along with the crowd in this sequel that can proudly stand on its own. During this past Christmas season, ROCKY BALBOA had the warm feeling of one last reunion with an old friend.So welcome back, old friend -- and farewell!",Rocky Balboa
438,ianrthompson,A Worthy Addition To The Series - Inspirational!,9,28 January 2007,"I would have given this film a ten, but no film I have ever seen deserves a ten... yet. I have long been a fan of the Rocky films although less so with Rocky 3. What I enjoy about the films is that Rocky is a gentle, and simple person, an underdog, who wins the hearts of the people. Granted in Rocky 3 he was a millionaire and a bit more civilised and that is probably why that isn't my favourite. Anyway, I digress. Rocky Balboa sees our hero in familiar surroundings, being thrust into the chance of a fight that has shades of Rocky 1 and 2. I sat there watching it having deliberately not investigated the plot on the 'net. I knew that Stallone had planned for Rocky to die at the end of Rocky 5, would this happen at the end of Rocky Balboa, I wondered?The editing is fantastic, with good use of archive footage. The training montage is there, as expected. There is humour and there is sadness.Stop reading this now, and go and see it. You won't be sorry.",Rocky Balboa
439,jc2ar,Rocky fans will be delighted....,8,23 January 2007,"Sly Stallone returns as the humble character we all love! His character is very much like what we depict in Rocky and Rocky II which is a very good thing because it brings you back to the underdog story that we all believed in.It was great to see old faces and new faces playing old characters that were minor in the previous films. I'm on about the character of Lil Marie (Screw you Creeeepo!) who is now an adult and has a son of her own, played by Geraldine Hughes. She was lovely throughout the film and I couldn't take my eyes off her for a second. She brings the sense into Rocky, telling him 'that fighters fight'. Great performances also by Paulie, played by Burt Young. I actually sympathised with him in this one because he realises that his treatment of Adrian was wrong and that he doesn't want Rocko to bring up the past. Great to see Spider Rico - it just brings in the nostalgia.The movie is heavily based on dramatic aspects and not too much emphasis on boxing. Think Rocky I and II again...although there's boxing in them, the story was actually the important thing. Nonetheless, Sly Stallone was in great shape for the movie. The training montage and the boxing scenes just makes you wanna sream Rocky at the top of your lungs. Sly's performance deserves an Oscar at least. Throughout the film, you see him interact with the characters in different ways - be it angry, happy, joky etc - and he makes his point. He doesn't overact or act the tough guy - he's just....well he's Rocky. We all love Rocky.Well im getting late for college....so watch Rocky Balboa.

440,trigger_jam,Rocky Balboa Hits Hard,8,20 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa Hits HardFirst, let me get my personal motivation out of the way. For me it was just enough to see Sylvester Stallone on the big screen. For whatever reason I'd never had the chance to see one of my favorite actors on the big screen. I have seen just about all of his movies but none until now on the big one. Old as he maybe, he can still deliver just as well. People never gave him a fair chance at acting or for anything other than action flicks. I'd ask such people to have a look at ""FIST"" and ""COPLAND"". To the movie.Don't go out to watch Rocky Bablboa to watch an action movie. If you want boxing action you can find it in Rocky 3 and Rocky 4 - well executed. This movie returns to the core of the first one. It digs in, once again, to say the same thing. It's only about getting to the fight that matters. If you stand up till you have nothing left you have won far more than anything you could put a price on. I loved the melodrama, I enjoyed the dialogs. The best scene was the talk he had with his kid outside Adrian's*. That scene summed up the entire series. The fight is as expected. I was left wanting more but that's when the message hit me harder than anything else. For once, I feel, we are getting to see a proper farewell to a series. Alien series got screwed up. Terminator series got botched. Rocky 5 tried to mess this up but this here returns to end it well. (Everything about it is old. The loneliness. The training montage. The fight. The old Rocky. The Old Sly. The old message.)It touches those that care. It begs to fight. Hell I loved it. The audience cheered at the end. Some might have missed the subtleties but I bet they can't get those* words out of their minds.",Rocky Balboa
441,metehan711,May upset you after watching the entire series!,5,15 October 2018,"After reading all the comments giving 10 out of 10 I started thinking whether I was the only one who actually liked Rocky series but not this one. Maybe this wouldn't be the case if I haven't seen this film right after watching the 5 precedents. However this is how it went on and I can definitely say that this movie lacked a lot that the five preceding, let alone the fabulous first two, films had. I think its most crushing lack was Rocky's cause or motivation for the fight. Please don't tell me ""'cuz Fighters gotta fight"". No, they don't, particularly after their 50s and against a world champ at his 20s!! In all those first five movies, there was such a cause, such a logic behind those fights that would make you get into the movie and fight in Rocky's place if he ignored the challenges. This is apparently not the case in this one. I am sorry, but no, I couldn't feel it.Another setback is references to previous movies. I was expecting more hitting, provocative and somewhat modernised references to past movies. To begin with, the training scene had nothing original! I was going for a run and even about to sign up for a gym each time I saw any of first four movies - RB can only be compared to the fifth one in these terms. As with the music, I would expect some changes to the original tunes which would make you feel like you're listening to a 2000s version of, for example, ""Gonna fly now"". Listening to the same song over and over again after years passed would simply mean that you couldn't add anything new on what you wonderfully did years ago.Finally, the opponent. In most 21st century movies, when an actor is not artistically talented, he is at least expected to be handsome/beautiful or have a good body, as a consolation. This guy however lacked both criteria. In terms of script; he doesn't have a real story behind or an interesting connection to Rocky (please don't tell me that you bought that a world champion would ever accept to fight a senior legend just because he lost to his shape from decades ago in a video simulation).All in all, if you want to drop your Rocky addiction for a while (until you start again in a year or so), I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. But if you want to stay in the loop, just keep watching the first two or four or even five of the series and skip RB.",Rocky Balboa
442,ariitanywhere,A Rousing Encomium!,10,20 December 2006,"Like many Rocky fans, I was a little apprehensive with what to expect going into the last Rocky saga. I always prayed that Mr. Stallone made one more Rocky after the very disappointing 5. Let me just say that...it was well worth the wait. Sly doesn't disappoint his fans and gives us a befitting and very satisfying conclusion to the greatest underdog story of our time; arguably all time. This movie focused more on character development and takes us into Rocko's lonely life as a widower, running his restaurant Adrian's. Estranged from his son,who is struggling with his legendary father's legacy and trying to carve out his own identity. Paulie is back with his acerbic one liners and makes you laugh like old. The story is simple; Rocky wants to prove that age doesn't take away the fire inside and agrees to go one last round with the current heavyweight champ, Mason Dixon.I had lumps in my throat for a good part of the movie. The only complaint I had was Rocky's overzealous worshipping of Adrian's memory. Her picture in his van, many pictures in his restaurant and visiting her grave everyday was a bit much. But that's minor. Anthony Tarver does a fine job in underplaying his part and lets Stallone take it away gloriously as Rocky. Sly does an excellent job as the aged warrior Rocky and proves that it's not age but attitude that shapes our legacy and how people will remember us.I actually found myself enjoying the latter day life of Rocky more than the fight itself, until the last three rounds which were in one word-- unbelievable. Intersperced with flashbacks, the fight had zippy camera-work, b&w images, and fast jump cuts which made it all the more real looking.I bet Sly could beat Tarver in real life, he was that convincing as a 60 year old heavyweight. And oh yes, he would knock out a Foreman in the first round easily. I know you guys are dying to know how the montage and music is. It was understated and more believable. Rocky lifts 270 pound plates and does medicine ball pushups. And the best of all-- Conti's ""Gonna Fly Now"" comes soaringly alive in it's 21st century avatar.I won't give it away, but watch out for the new addition to it. I simply love this version even better than the original.Rock's old friends are all there--Cuff and Link grown ups now, and a new lovable mutt called ""Punchy"". Marie's role was essayed well, though I felt her son had little value to add. The only time I felt like cringing was when Tony Burton comes on. Age hasn't been good to him at all. He looked wizened and when he utters the ""hurting bombs"" dialogue, it felt corny and cheesy. I wish he had risen to the occasion and done a better job. This movie is full of inspiring quotes. I remember top of mind the ""sunshine and rainbows"" speech to his son and another one where he tells Marie that ""you don't need to owe anything to give something"". The last run up the stairs with Punchy was beautiful with snow falling and was a great cinematic moment.I would like to say that rest aside all your fears and go see this movie and spread the word to family and friends. I would like to thank Mr.Stallone for not disappointing us and giving us a very satisfying conclusion to our favorite hero's fairytale story. Go enjoy this movie and I am sure many of you will see it again. I definitely will. The triumph of will and the human spirit lives alive and well in this world. The movie proves that in spades. And it's all the more believable because you see a real 60 year old man proving that ""It ain't over till it's over"". If I had to compare, I'd say this movie is on par with the original. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. But most of all, it will inspire a whole new generation.",Rocky Balboa
443,cshokraii,Great ending to the most beloved movie of out time,9,21 December 2006,"I loved the new Rocky, it had much of the old Rocky 1 flavor with todays humor and atmosphere. It was drama filled with the passing of Adrian and flashbacks of her. In a way i'm glad that they didn't show her passing in the movie itself because most true Rocky fans such as myself would've been weeping like school children. There were little tid bits of humor that really made the movie special. The only thing missing was a buildup to the fight, there was none other than the training montage!! Oh and the training was mediocre compared to the Rocky movies of the past. I think they should've had the spider character help with the training a bit, that would've made it pretty cool. Overall though it was great to see this movie end this was as opposed to the last one which made Rocky look like he lost his mind in a way.

It's not that I want to knock the franchise or Sly per-se it's just that the whole idea does seem preposterous as well as simultaneously intriguing. Nostalia & cynicism at the same time. How the hell can Rocky/Sly do it at 50 or 60 or whatever he is etc, etc...Well, whilst I could smile wryly at Sly's transparent ""please love me again"" performance I also had to admire the man's physical commitment to the project and even speaking as a big boxing fan, I had to admire the way he's (just) plausibly engineered & executed the grand finale's fight.If you're new to Rocky, you're probably not interested in this film one iota but if you're familiar... well, it has a curiosity value & restores a bit of a dignity to Mr Balboa. God help us, Rambo's next.",Rocky Balboa
446,MCorpsShredder,Great movie,10,6 February 2007,This is the the first rocky film i have seen and i was great i watched the film and would certainly want to watch it again.It is one of the best films i have ever seen and i hope to watch the other rocky films.if you want to watch a boxing film i would recommend this would be one of the films that you should watch. I enjoyed it so much i am going to get the DVD and watch it a couple more times. and it was great of Sylvester Stallone to finish the Rocky with a great ending.This film does not disappoint and it gives it all with a great ending. Watch the film and you would be grad you did and see what you would have missed out if you didn't,Rocky Balboa
447,GeNioS,Rocky Recipe = Stale Ingredients.,5,8 January 2007,"Haven't I seen this before? Let's see....recipe for a Rocky movie..* Bruised relationship with family to be mended with emotional fight. But this time Paulie needs to get fired to attend and son needs to quit job to attend.* Depressed Rocky wants to fight again because somehow still has something to prove.....even after beating the Russian giant in IV and HIV in V. Isn't that enough? Guess Not.* Training session including the one-armed push ups and a run up the stairs....again. Don't forget to have him hit some meat. Of course he has to get snuck into the meat factory because Paulie already got fired - see A. Also, this time add a basketball to push ups and an orphan dog to the run. (Seriously, if you couldn't laugh at Rocky picking up the dog, named Punchy, at the top of the steps you need to see it again without the music.* During fight, slowly make Rocky look more beat up until at the end he doesn't look human. Sad part is that this time around it didn't take as much makeup because he's way too OLD.* Fight goes the distance, even after both fighters get knocked down 8,000 times and Tarver....er....Mason Dixon, breaks his hand. Wasn't Rocky always the one that got injured and battled on? But this time we're going to add a couple of (strange) twists....* This time to really make it interesting, have Rocky fight a guy you actually empathize with. I actually wanted Tarver....er....Mason Dixon to win. His own trainer was telling him to let Rocky have a chance. If that doesn't suck, what does?* Add HBO PPV and HBO's announcers and a real referee. Have him fight against a real fighter. Make the fight actually appear to be an actual boxing match on HBO pay-per-view. By doing this you make the fake fighting look even more fake. At least the fake fighting wasn't so bad in the surreal environments of the first IV....er...V? There was five before this right?* Have Rocky pick up an orphan dog just before he takes in a single parent child who happens to be black because he has a Jamaican father. Give the kid a job and have him hang out in your corner....right next to your real son....have them not say two words to each other the whole film....this was a film, right?* Add a new girlfriend that isn't really his girlfriend because he's still spending more time at the cemetery then with the living. But make sure you have her attend the fight so she can chant Adrian's former lines,""Get Up!"" and ""Win!"" and ""Rocky...Rocky...Rocky."" Then, when the fight ends, don't show her again.Lastly, a question? Did anyone else think the people in the restaurant looked extremely bored listening to Rocky? Look, I wouldn't bother writing any of this except I had to go 12 pages to find a negative review of the movie. I only have one question. Did I go to the only theater that didn't pass out crack at the door? This movie was so bad that if they sold it as a spoof I'd preorder the DVD.I kept waiting for Survivor to make a mid-fight concert appearance, with a plug for their new ""playing songs from the 80's while we're in our 80's"" cassette tape. I think GoldenPalace.com must have bought up all the shameless plugs and there just wasn't any room left.P.S. You think this is the end of Rocky? Please. This movie serves as nothing more than to get his son, by the way now unemployed, into adulthood so he can follow in dad's footsteps. If anyone has any pull with the man upstairs, please ask him to not let this happen. Rocky should have retired on top, and Stallone should have retired on....well...let's just say he should have retired.",Rocky Balboa
448,slem76,"ROCKY ""hits"" the theaters in Germany!",9,11 February 2007,"First: ROCKY is the greatest! And after all this years i was afraid to see a hero of my childhood in pieces. In his own blood so to say. But Stallone saved the myth and made a touching movie about growing old without fading away. ROCKY is almost 60 years old, but hey: It's still the Italien Stallion! The guy that beat Apollo, Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago and you don't mess around with a legend. Is the first half (for a Rocky movie) a small and quiet film simply about loss and relationships, so is the second half pure ROCKY. I think if you don't like the character anyway you won't start to by watching this part of the series, but if you loved ROCKY all the years like i do you won't be disappointed. It's like in the old days, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat screaming: ""ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!"", ""Hit 'em!"" and ""Stand up!"" All that kind of stuff. Well, at least inside yourself. So to speak with the fist in your pocket. So watch it! It's the last chance to see a ROCKY movie in a big theater! They never come back! I want to close with the already famous dialogue from the movie:ROCKY: ""To many people came to Las Vegas to loose. I'm not here to loose."" DIXON: ""You've already lost."" ROCKY: ""It ain't over till it's over."" DIXON: ""Where is that from? The 80s?"" ROCKY: ""Probably the 70s.""Goodbye Rocko. We had a great time...",Rocky Balboa

Would it be an embarrassment to Sly, would it be OK ? Well let me tell you I don't think I have in my life ever been so moved by a movie. Its not just the boxing in this film...its much more than that. There is a deep emotional line running throughout this film that I guarantee you wont find in any other film.They are some scenes in this movie that actually earned a few tears out of my eye each time...and I'm someone that is rarely moved emotionally. This film will give you a lot to think about. Is it good ? No its ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC... Knowing that the film you are about to see was written, directed and starring the same person makes it all that much more special to me. Rocky is Sly's and this film shows that Stallone is an excellent film maker and storyteller. If you haven't seen this movie, go watch it. I promise you that you will be glad that you saw it.

I was surprise to see a very good quality movie, I didn't expect so good photography and also I was stunned by Stallone's acting (it was not flawless nor extremely good but certainly great) the movie has this melancholy air that really make a master piece out of Rocky. The script was actually good and with a lot of content (I expected something stupid to be honest) and that one was one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.

The emotions captured by Rocky (Stallone) are superb it sums up all the rocky films and really emphasises what rocky is all about, which is how anything is possible and that the underdog can always win. The acting from Paulie (Young) was also touching. Rocky is a film which can change your life it is seemingly magnificent. Rocky is shown as a more wiser person in this film he is a lot more matured and he is a successful respected person who everybody loves. If you want to see a film which will most certainly touch you forever than Rocky is the one, though i would advise that you watch rocky 1,2 and 3 first. All in all Rocky Balboa is definitely worth the watch!!!",Rocky Balboa

Probably 5 rounds of applause and people yelling ""rocky rocky"" during the fight! Once the training sequence started people were cheerring from then on until the end. Really liked the acting (very subtle)and all of the characters, paulie stands out. Very much like the first one but witha much more exciting fight sequence, and extremely well edited fight sequence. Great music, and once it played the crowd got going. I would highly recommend this movie, especially to all you naysayers out there. GO AND SEE IT BECAUSE THERE WILL NEVER BE FILMS MADE LIKE THIS EVER AGAIN, OR HAVE A STAR SUCH AS STALLONE EVER AGAIN.

This film is Sly/Rock'y way of finding his redemption.Acting-wise I think that Sly brought a very strong dramatic and comedic presence in his performance, very heartfelt, dignified and believable. And man I gotta say he looks good for being 60! The training montage was great and very inspirational! Milo Ventimiglia brought an interesting blend of resentment and pride in his character. The role of Paulie, played by Bert Young we dead on! He hadn't changed a bit, actually his character was THE comic relief of the film. Antonio Tarver did quite well his first time around as an actor. The smugness and arrogance of his character was believable and it reminded me of Apollo Creed in the 1st film.I won't say a thing about the main event... that's for you to find out! Rocky Balboa delivers and the saga came to full circle perfectly!",Rocky Balboa
455,Prophet797,Just As Good As The First,10,2 December 2006,"I saw this film at a test screening a few months ago. While I am a fan of all the films I think this one is the most on par with the first one. While two thru five were good films they had more to do with Rocky as a public figure and his fame. In this film he is not that distanced from the guy he was in the first, maybe just a little wiser. The film doesn't focus so much on boxing as it does on the actual character of Rocky and the trials he faces having one day been on top of the world and now he leads a simple life and thrives on his memories.I am a huge Stallone fan but I realize his career has been in a slump lately, but this film would be a perfect resurrection for him. The acting is great and it has some of the best writing I've seen in years. Two very powerful scenes are when Rocky tries to get his license back and probably the best scene of the film is when he confronts his son.Any Stallone or Rocky fan will love this film. And I'm sure a lot of people who had doubts about this film 30 years later or even Stallone being 60 years old will be very surprised and pleased. And it does not hurt that Sylvester Stallone is in better shape at 60 then half of Hollywood under 30.I've already seen the movie but I plan to be there opening day to see it again.",Rocky Balboa

Great storyline, respectable acting, and a great ending to one of the greatest underdog stories of all time. After the steady downhill from rocky 2-5, this movie makes us forget there ever was rocky 2-5. The first Rocky was still the best for me, but this comes in a close second. The crooked jawed mumble talking bruiser from Philly has done it again. Now, he's going back in the ring, just to finish the itch. This one great fight that is still left inside his stomach. It was a good storyline to follow and how Stallone brought it to the screen was remarkable. Seeing ""Paulie"" in the meat house was even more classic.

458,basslinemacho,Hero of the people,9,19 November 2021,"T seemed that we had truly at last come to the end of the 'ROCKY SAGA' with the release of Rocky V. Who would bring the series up to the high level of Box Office Apeal and ,yes, Cinematic Artistry. Well we were wrong! Stallone went to the well just once more and succeeded in breathing some new life into the series by going back to the basics. In the story's opening, we find Mr. Balboa is back in the old neighborhood, running a restaurant (looked like a pretty nice place, no greasy spoon or hash house it!) The bar/cabaret bore the name 'Adrian', after Rock's wife. We also find out that she has passed on, leaving a huge gap in both Mr. Balboa's life and that of their son.Rocky finds that he misses the sweet science and slowly gets re-involved in training and, after some very typical Stallone/Rocky musical interlude training montages, we arrive at the point of a big fight, this time being billed as an ""exhibition"". The fight was a natural for what locale? Why it would be great in Las Vegas, of course.As in all of the Rocky series, the fight scenes are first rate and truly exciting, especially when they're viewed with a good sized, theatre audience. Director Stallone gives touch of extra authenticity by having the bout covered by real fight announcing personnel and by framing the the visuals by real HBO TV screen titles. Real life former Champ, Mike Tyson is on hand for some trash talking with the new Champ. The total effect is that of being a feast for the senses, visually and in the original incidental music.All of what has been described up to now is mainly what we all expected in a Rocky film. What is it that elevated this installment of the saga above the previous episodes? Maybe Sly has developed a new perspective on life, both Rocky's and his own. He seemed to approach the screenplay with both a rejuvenated attitude and a respect and affection for the early days of the story.It may be the return of characters from the early days such as now all grown up Neighborhood girl Marie, and old opponent Spider Ricco and Apollo Creed's old Trainer Tony that provide us with a link to the original concept of Mr. Balboa as a true man of many contradictions. He was a club fighter and a collector for local juice loan man Garza (the late Mr. Joe Spinnell). He was at once brutally crude and yet he was a picture of innocence.No doubt that screen writer Stallone's ability to paint us a picture that is realistic enough, yet providing us with enough laughs via his subplot incidents and a good handle on some comic relief. I mean what other author could have pulled off such a literary pun as naming the new (fictional) undisputed World's Heavyweight Champ 'Mason ""the Line"" Dixon'.Sly says that this is the end of the line the Italian Stallion. If so, it's great that he's going bout on top of his game.! But on the other hand,if Mr. Stallone returns to the well just one more time, well.......... who knows.",Rocky Balboa
459,mn8335,Taking It Too Far,3,7 January 2007,"This film is mediocre. I think the Rocky series has taken it a little too far. The acting is average, the plot thin and characters underdeveloped.Rocky gives a couple of dramatic speeches in the film, but they were contrived and overacted. ""Little Marie"" and her son are supposed to be germane to the plot, but neither character is explored in-depth to make them seem necessary. I think Stallone going for the emotional impact just made everything seem cheesy. The storyline would have been better served with Talia Shire playing ""devil's advocate"" against Rocky going to compete for a final time. Some type of conflict that way would have moved the plot along better than what we see in this film. Their on-screen chemistry was what held the previous Rocky movies together anyway. Also, Rocky drawing strength from his wife's memory was a bit dramatic, once again, and it felt as if the viewer is being dragged along a very uncomfortable Memory Lane.Basically, with the disjointed flashbacks and archival footage, combined with incorporating old characters (can you believe Paulie is still around?!) plus the opening song, this film seemed more like a nostalgic E! True Hollywood Story than a Rocky movie that can stand on its own. The ending isn't even inspiring.Stallone is in great shape for being 60 years old, but I didn't need to pay $9.00 to find that out. Save your money and get this one on PPV.",Rocky Balboa

It had everything, action, great acting, comedy, sadness, suspense etc. etc. This film should be nominated as well as Stallone and Burt Young for best actor and best supporting actor respectively.

This could have very easily been a nostalgic vomit fest...but, I think it pulled off what it was trying to do quite well.First and foremost...the fighting seems so much more realistic than the Bobble head fighting the the previous films.Of course I love the line ""Its not about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get it, and keep moving forward.""Anyway, I'm still a huge fan of Ep4, and the original 2, but to me, this one stands apart.btw--- I don't understand the hype around Creed.

It was also a delight having two of my firmest predictions about the story proved wrong.Sly writes himself a lot of speeches, and the self-referential stuff piles up, and a few new characters don't get much to do or say (insert other nitpicks of no consequence here), but it's still a very good time at the movies.",Rocky Balboa

His interaction with his son was something any parent could relate to. I got all choked up at one part and my girlfriend started to cry because we could really relate to it all on a personal level. There was great life lessons in this in that no matter how many times life knocks you down you're only out if you don't get back up and keep moving forward.Paulie was really great in this and the whole cast did a terrific job. There was a lot of intense scenes and enough humor to balance it out. This is a must see especially for the over fifty crowd.,Rocky Balboa
466,Chris Ronson,Rocky Balboa hooks and jabs his way back to the Big Screen!,8,5 January 2007,"The year 1976 saw 'Italian Stallion' Sylvester Stallone jab and hook his way into the hearts and minds of millions worldwide as the boxer Rocky Balboa. Fourteen years and four sequels later Rocky fought in his last bout, a street-fight (Of all things!) in the fifth and sadly the worst film of the series. Stallone, unhappy with the way things were left with his work and now at the age of 60, recently decided to finish what he started with a sixth and final chapter in the Rocky saga. Since the announcement of the project, critics and fans alike have debated and questioned whether Stallone, at the age he is, could pull off a feat of such magnitude, not only completing the story of Rocky but also saving the legend of his character.Well, the wait is now over. January 19th 2007 sees the return of Rocky Balboa in arguably his biggest challenge yet, and quite frankly this does not disappoint.The majority of the film centres on the relationships between the series' remaining characters in some well performed and somewhat moving scenes and effectively ties up any and all loose-ends from the previous stories. However the best portion of the film is when Rocky comes out of retirement for his 'one last fight', to prove to himself and everyone that ever believed in him that he still has what it takes to be the best (Or at least stay vertical with the best!). After a brief montage of training shots mixed with the infamous 'Eye of the Tiger' track from the previous films, the action switches to the main event, Rocky Balboa VS Mason Dixon played by athlete Antonio Tarver, in what has to be the finest filmed fight scene I have witnessed in a long, long time.. It looks and feels like a 'Big Fight Live' match on TV and definitely manages to capture all of the energy and excitement of a real-life main event.The only downside to the film is in the scripting as it contains some of the worst dialogue to make it to the 'Big Screen' in years. It is redeemed however by the fact you can't help but laugh it off because after all, you have just been given a chance to see another Rocky movie, and one that certainly does stand up to the quality of the other films.Stallone took quite a gamble with this project, but I think he has pulled it off with a level of finesse that should prove to everyone that his career, just like the career of his creation Rocky Balboa is definitely not dead. YO ADRIAN.

In the film, Rocky is aging and is the owner of an Italian restaurant called Adrian's. It's a heartfelt story with Rocky back in his neighborhood revisiting old characters. When ESPN broadcasts a computer simulation of a fight between Rocky and the current champion, where Rocky wins. Hence an exhibition fight is organized.A movie filled with positive messages to keep moving forward well acted all around. To this day I think this film is one of the best comeback of an actor but also his character. Big props to Stallone, he knows how to make a classic. The only problem I have writing this review is I can't say something that hasn't been said. I felt Stallone should have earned this Oscar nomination for this one instead of Creed",Rocky Balboa
469,TheWakingFalcoln,"Wow, this film...is actually wonderful!",10,20 December 2006,"I laughed like everyone else when I heard that ""Rocky VI,"" was going to be made. I thought there was no way that sixty-year-old Stallone could possibly make anything but a bad film...lo and behold, I was wrong. Just like Rocky is the underdog boxer, Stallone is the underdog filmmaker, and both prevail against the odds. This is an absolutely wonderful film, and the best of the Rocky movies since the first one.Are there things that don't work? Yes. Most noticeably, Talia Shire is dearly missed. I don't have a problem with--- SPOILER --her dying, actually I thought it was a great emotional element of the film, the problem is, she is replaced by a different character that should not have been featured as prominently as she was. Also, Stallone's monologues can get a little on the cheesy side at times, but then again, what ""Rocky"" movie hasn't had those? You end up loving them in the end, anyway, because the character of Rocky is just one of those rare characters in cinema nowadays that are just purely and unreservedly good.Yeah, Rocky's had a lot of different films. Yes, he may be overdone. But if you don't get a ton of chills upon hearing, ""Gonna Fly Now,"" as the training montage starts, then something is wrong with you. I was disappointed to hear that the ""Rocky"" franchise would end on V, because it didn't go out with a bang.

470,xelalex73,Great movies,10,15 January 2007,"There have been some truly magnificent movie franchises, 007, The Godfather, Harry Potter, but none that conjure up so many emotions as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Rocky. For as great as James Bond has been over the years, you can't really shed a tear for any of the characters, same can be said about the Corleones, and Mr. Potter, but not for the Skywalkers, Hobbits and the Italian Stallion. I will address the Rocky franchise in this comment, the Balboa story was born out of uncertainty, it grew into a commercial success and it ended in an extremely high note, even Stallone's most bitter critics have recognized that the sixth and final installment is quite a good picture. Rocky was and is still considered one of the greatest movies ever, an original story, with a very believable development and finale, Rocky II followed in the same line, with, however, a typical Hollywood ending, nonetheless, a great second part, and at some levels, even more passionate than the first one. Rocky III was a full blown three ring circus, more entertaining, but lacking the heart and emotions of its predecessors. Rocky IV was a cold war motivated vehicle, don't get me wrong, I'm no commie, but let's face it, it was made in the same way Moonraker was made for James Bond, taking advantage of the late seventies space films craze. In 1985 it was the right move for Stallone, and I also have to say that aside from the USA vs. USSR issue it's an extremely spectacular chapter with some of the best training montages of the franchise. Rocky V is the weakest link in the series, Stallone and Avildsen tried to make a comeback to the original two, but the result was just awful, much in the same light the first two prequels of Lucas's Star Wars had miserably failed. The movie pretended to have the heart of the original and the action of the latter, it had neither. But Rocky Balboa is a true savior for the saga, it's one of the most emotional films I've seen since the Lord of the Rings, and Stallone gives one of his best performances, like he said , he was and will always be Rocky Balboa, and that's a wonderful legacy, because Rocky is what we all, deep inside, want to be, decent, good, be an example to others, and give all our heart in whatever mission, job, or dream we pledge ourselves to. The Italian Stallion lives on in each and every one of us, regardless of how much we have parodied his legendary existence, and Rocky Balboa, the movie does just that. Finally, my eternal thanks to Mr. Stallone for creating such an endearing epic saga to enjoy and appreciate.",Rocky Balboa

Still living in the past, Rocky is restless, wanting a meaning to his life.This film, I treated it as another Rocky movie, a Rocky movie that I was glad to see didn't disappoint.Every thing was perfect, it seemed a bit slow in places but that was needed, it gave the film dimension.I would recommend anyone to go watch this film, even if its for the fight scenes alone. Its a must see!",Rocky Balboa
472,silversprings-1,"What a beautiful love story, and oh yeah, there's some boxing to keep the men entertained too!",9,21 December 2006,"If only Sly had done Rocky I, II and Rocky Balboa as the final film of the series, he would have had so much more respect in Hollywood. (But of course he'd have about $100 million less in his portfolio too...) Without being too spoilerish I can say it's a great flick that stays very true to the spirit of the first film. I think why Rocky I was such a universal hit is that while guys enjoyed the sports/competition aspect of the tale, women recognized that it was actually one of the best love stories ever filmed. In Rocky Balboa, Adrian is physically gone, but still ends up being the heart of the movie. One thing I admire is that Rocky still loves her so much even in death that Stallone didn't try to just create another substitute love interest in her place. There is a woman (Marie, the smoking teenager from the first film, now a 40-something mom) who he cares about and in post Rocky Balboa-land, you feel could even end up being another Mrs. Balboa, but never another Adrian. And I like that Marie respects his devotion to his late wife's memory and isn't threatened by it. She knows Adrian was the love of his life and she wouldn't even attempt to go there. There's a very touching pre-fight scene that demonstrates this and brought tears to my eyes. Rocky Balboa does have the monumental boxing bout of course, but it's not just a typical macho sports film, just like the first one wasn't. I honestly think this one is just as much a love story as Rocky was, only in this one the love interest is deceased. If anything, I felt this one was more touching and romantic than the original. I really, really loved this movie.",Rocky Balboa
473,wjbates3,Rocky was knocked out since Rocky III,3,9 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa, what can I say. If you want to see a Rocky that is a reminder of the first then watch the first half of this film. If you want to see a political load of crap trying to support what America is doing in Iraq watch it all. Rocky is the freedom ideology of America, he represents the American dream, what could be, but what never is. In Rocky Balboa we see the man back as a bum, a widower. Until he gets another chance to prove himself to the world. Before he fights he must overcome the fighters licensee commission (UN in Bush language)who refuse to him, until he makes a riveting speech that ended up like Swiss cheese. He finally gets his chance to fight but his son is against it, (all those Democrats and there non violence ways). Again another speech how the heart and soul allows us to go on and fight for what we believe in. The film doesn't climax the last fight is a mess, using a more realistic approach which never works. Anyone who watch's the Rocky films is expecting the in ring action CU of punches but here we are left untouched from a safe distance outside the ring. no civilians get hurt in the ring only the trained professionals, just like the army - BULLS**T. The film never takes off and certainly doesn't know how to punch. No more please Sly and stop making more patriotic crap in the form of Rambo, another destined failure no doubt.",Rocky Balboa
474,rcgrad,One of those movies you can put in your (mind's) pocket!,10,22 December 2006,"I love movies that can sincerely reflect a part of yourself in some parallel way. Many feel good movies are so phony that even though they try to portray the average guy and form some kind of empathy with you, they fail miserably.Rocky does not. If you are a human being, you will find yourself hiding in one frame or the other, if not for the duration of the movie in Rocky series.You'll witness the hopes, frustrations, love, unfairness, occasional miracles that you yourself felt or lived through.I don't cry in many movies, I can count them with the fingers of my right hand. 2 of them were Rocky 1 and 2, now I need to use my ""south paw"" for Rocky Balboa. There were so many moments that I related to, so many moments that reminded me of my own lost love, my own sorrows and disappointment with the world that I cried openly, not ashamed at all as the people sitting to my sides were doing the same.A good movie can make you cry for stuff happening to the characters. Only a great movie can make you cry for the paths you took in your own life. Make you reflect back, cherish for some of the choices you made, feel pain for the others.Rocky was always one of those movies. This last and sadly final installation delivers perfectly in this respect. As a person who saw the first movie as a 4 year old, it's been one hell of a ride and my immense gratitude to Slyvester for his great story and acting. You're my foremost runner for lifetime achievement award.",Rocky Balboa

Good for a cheesy evening of entertainment, with Adrian shouting for Rocky, Rocky shouting for Adrian...etc. Always got me in the cockles of my heart, if you know what I mean.So I expected much of the same from the new flick...I was overwhelmed with the raw emotion of this film. I don't want to give anything away, but this movie is definitely not the same-ol' Rocky. This film is so emotionally charged, it brought me to tears fairly early on.If you've always liked Rocky movies, go see this one and be reminded why Rocky is such an endearing character.If you've never liked Rocky movies, go see this one and be shown why so many people do, and be prepared to have your opinion changed. :)",Rocky Balboa

I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but let me say without giving anything away, that Sly does not disappoint! If you like the original, go check this out. It has heart and will leave you jonesing to run up the Philadelphia Art Museum steps. Not sure what else to say, but I can't submit without a minimum of 10 lines. It definitely has a classic feel to it and brings back many of the characters you've come to love. I've heard that Stallone was disappointed with number 5, which I've never seen, but this definitely redeems any shortcomings and is a great way to bring the story full circle. Way to go champ!",Rocky Balboa
477,acehit,Not the rocky film I hoped it would be!,4,28 January 2007,"As a huge rocky fan, I was very excite when I heard they were going to release a sixth film. I really wanted this film to take rocky to the next level and had high expectations. Since Stallone is nearing sixty, it needed a really good script.After watching the entire film, I have to say I wasn't impressed for a number of reasons. The tone of the movie is set to match that of the original rocky film, which I don't have a problem with but there are some issues which bothered me.1. To start off I was never happy with the title Rocky Balboa, It should have just been Rocky 6. Mainly because re-titling makes it out to be almost a standalone movie and not a continuity of the series. The original was called Rocky, so I didn't like the fact that this was called Rocky Balboa.2. My interest in the movie died after just three minutes into the film. Isn't a rocky movie supposed to start with the last fight of the previous film? As a purist I don't like it when traditions are broken, I was really hopping for a short rocky vs tommy fight montage at the beginning it would have opened the film up nicely.3. The absence of Adrian really brought the film down for me, For me she was a great character and the rocky movies wouldn't be the same without her.4. I have a real problem with the script. Rocky goes back in the ring to fight mason dixon, but without any real reason except to prove he still has what it takes. However there is no reference to the fact that in the previous movie he suffered severe brain damage, it's almost as if this never happened.5. The score is my next concern. The music used throughout the movie is just a recycled mix of the first three Rocky movies. I would have liked to hear a fresh score but still somehow relating to the old one. This is how each rocky movie evolved, each had it's own individual score, but still not going too far from the theme.6. Displeased with most of the film I hoped that the final fight would save it from a complete disappointment but I have some further criticism to make. The fight wasn't uplifting for me and lacked the magic of the previous rocky fights. I really did feel that something was missing here.Overall it wasn't a terrible film, I did enjoy some scenes and there were some great lines especially when Rocky had that argument with his son. I just think that it's a film that came too late, the idea of Rocky 6 has been around for years, and they should have started something when the idea was first conceived.",Rocky Balboa
478,paukenmeister,The best of all the Rocky sequels.,10,23 January 2007,"I'll be brief and try not to repeat what others have said before me. ""Rocky Balboa"" is, IMHO, the absolute best of all the ""Rocky"" sequels.""Rocky II"" - He wins the champeenship (Yay!) but is no longer an underdog. - Not bad.""Rocky III"" - He loses his original desire to win, loses his title to Mr. T, loses Mickey. Training scenes border on homo-erotic. Rocky re-gains title. - Sliding downhill ""Rocky IV"" - Apollo dies . . . at the hands of a Russian boxer. Rocky gets revenge and makes a dumb speech at the end of the movie. - Sliding further downhill.""Rocky V"" - Hoooooo boy. Rocky's broke. Rocky takes in a ""be-mulleted"" boxer and trains him, becomes a rotten father to Rocky Jr. in the process. The film *tries* to capture past elements from the previous films at an attempt towards an homage to the franchise. Rocky is told he can never fight again due to getting hit in the head a zillion times - and he gets in a street fight at the end of the movie. - What were they thinking when they made this POS? I agree with someone who posted that one should see ""Rocky"", ""Rocky II"" then ""Rocky Balboa"".",Rocky Balboa
479,caladin,Rocky and myth and truth,9,23 December 2006,"No doubt this was a Rocky movie. Sylvester Stallone, like the character of Rocky, had to dig deep down inside to make this movie a winner. It just made sense this is where Rocky ended up. I think everyone who is truly a Rocky fan disregarded Rocky V. And this is the follow up to Rocky IV which had great themes and should be played in history classes when talking about the Cold War. Rocky VI is a great example of Art imitating life. Stallone represents us all... he always has. A man who built himself up physically, mentally, and financially when the whole world said no to him. We could all learn from him. The Rocky character is an American Icon and it is fitting he goes out this way. Forget that he is in his late 50's... he still looks like he could kick some ass. But it's not the fight at the end that makes this movie because we all expect that... it's is the humanity of this character... and Stallone has not acted with such pathos and emotion for a long time. He was truly inspired in this movie. This is not in the realm of Rocky I and II but it's close. If you love Rocky... you must see it and put the character away in the pantheon of other great mythological heroes as Hercules, Robin Hood, and Arthur, but with all these characters there is a a little truth and history; and Rocky has that substance... how many times has this character inspired you?",Rocky Balboa
480,zushen,A superb triumph to the series...,10,21 December 2006,"I'd be willing to bet that most people that went to see this movie didn't have high expectations. Those people probably figured, ""well, Rocky 5 sucked so this one can't be any better"", but curiosity got them to go to the theatre anyway. I was one of those people. I was partial to Rocky 5 but my favorites were Rocky and Rocky 3. They seemed to get worse as time went on. To my surprise, this one is my favorite Rocky movie by far. It's simple, it's realistic, and it hits on so many levels... but you won't find what you want to know in any review, you just have to go see it yourself. A lot of the reviews jumped to the conclusion that this movie was bad, horrible, terrible, etc. Of course, those reviewers get paid to rip apart any movie because they are sell outs. Then again, more reviewers praised this movie than ripped it apart so respect goes out to all of the ones who actually wrote what they thought about the film rather than ones who wrote what a paycheck told them to. The bottom line is, this is a movie about a man who has lost the thing he loves most in his life (his wife), lost connection with his son, and finds a sense of redemption by re-entering a world we all have come to know him from, for one last time. I'm actually looking forward to seeing the new Rambo now. 10 out of 10.",Rocky Balboa

Regardless, the most important thing is that Rocky still has the magic. It moved me many times and inspired me completely, as Rocky is supposed to do. My only somewhat major criticism is the number of unsatisfied subplots and supporting characters. The whole Adrian aspect was very touching, if a little over done. Stallone does a helluva job. Burt Young is as good as always. We even feel a connection with the opponent, for once. Rocky Balboa does as well in the theaters as he does in the ring (this is not a spoiler).",Rocky Balboa

I was dreading this movie since I first read about it on IMDb, and expected it to be a joke, but then I heard it was actually good, so I decided to go see it and give it an honest chance. This movie was slow for the first half hour, Rocky crying, Dix showing how fantastic he is, Rocky being kinda' charming, the son being a jerk, Rocky crying.

483,reinholdfilm,The streets of Philadelphia,9,18 January 2007,"Finally, after so many years of waiting, it's here! ROCKY BALBOA! I have always been a huge fan of Rocky - especially the first three films, so I have been looking forward to this film for a long time.After watching it - when the credits rolled over the screen to Conti's now classical Rocky-score, I felt good - really good! I was satisfied. ROCKY BALBOA is a great film about a great man and it goes back to the roots of it all. Some elements are missing though (Adrian) but I learned to live with it half way through the movie. Sylvester Stallone is back in his ""character-for-life"" and does it perfectly. He IS Rocky. Adding Little Marie and Spider Rico from the first film, could have been a bit dangerous, but surprisingly, it worked out fantastic. The friendship that evolves between Rocky and Marie means everything to the film, and is a real pleasure to watch. Thumbs up! To me, it seemed that Rocky and Paulie is not that close anymore - they seen to have some sort of distance between them, that I can't really figure out. Maybe it's because of Adrians death, maybe Paulie is just too distant to the viewer. We could have gotten closer to him and his friendship with Rocky - I don't know.There are things I am disappointed about. The whole training-sequence is happening way too fast. All of a sudden he starts training, and Duke (Tony Burton) is all of a sudden in the film - no introduction. Another thing is the whole look of the film. I had hoped they would have gone ""back-to-basics"" and shot it ""Rocky-style"" - like the first film. Slow, dark and less colorful. That's one of the things I LOVE about the first two films - the whole visual style. But this new film is very modern in it's colors and the final fight is shot MTV-like with a lot of fancy visual effects. That's disappointing to me. They should have gone back to the original in my opinion.All in all - Rocky still rules, and Sly has made a really great film that he can be proud of. No doubt about it! ROCKY BALBOA is a great and powerful movie, that especially Rocky-fans will love! Go for it! It ain't over till it's over!!!",Rocky Balboa

Not only does Stallone look young and in shape and does an actual great acting job, the story line of the movie is awesome. Great to see Burt Young acting again, but this movie is awesome, the best since the first one, no corny gimmick, no over acting, no nonsense storyline, just a wonderful movie with a great moral of how your only as old as your heart tells you. Once again great movie, I recommend to everybody, I suggest to you go watch it because there will never be another Rocky movie because there is no way Sylvester Stallone can improve or better this one.",Rocky Balboa
485,MattsMovieReviews,Sylvester Stallone comes back swinging!,8,23 February 2007,"When I first heard that Sylvester Stallone was going to bring back the Italian Stallion for another round I found the news to be rather unsettling. ""Rocky V"", while not the best film in the franchise was still (in my opinion) a fitting finale to the series, and the fact that it has been 16 years since the last film (making Stallone 60 years old) did not make things any easier. But I was wrong. Dead wrong. ""Rocky Balboa"" sees the aging southpaw still living in his house in Philadelphia. Long retired from the sport of boxing, Rocky is now widowed and alone after his beloved wife Adrian (played in previous films by Talia Shire) passed away a few years previously due to cancer while his relationship with his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) is fragile to say the least since Robert feels he can't be his own man due to his father's celebrity. The owner of an Italian restaurant named after his late wife, Rocky holds court re-living past glory's while once a year on the anniversary of Adrian's death he along with brother in law Pauile (Burt Young) tour the places where he and Adrian had met and fell in love which angers Paulie who does not want to be reminded about how he treated his sister, and tells Rocky that he should let Adrian go. Alone and depressed Rocky goes back to his old stomping ground for a quick drink where he finds 'little' Marie ( the girl from the first film who told Rocky to screw himself now played by Irish actress Geraldine Hughes) working as a bartender. They become fast friends and Rocky offers her and her son Steps (James Francis Kelly III) a job at his restaurant. Around this time ESPN host a simulated computer fight between Rocky and the current undefeated yet disrespected champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) which Rocky wins by knockout. After watching the fight something awakens in Rocky who decides to come out of retirement and box again but only in small time local fights. Receiving the go ahead to box again by the state athletic commission, Rocky is approached by Dixon's managers who want to capitalize on the popularity of the computer fight and set up an exhibition match in Las Vegas. Rocky accepts the challenge only to be faced with a public backlash and the ire of his son, as once again the underdog must go against the odds and unleash the beast that has built up inside of him. A compelling and emotionally touching film that reminds of the first two Rocky movies, ""Rocky Balboa"" is an excellent finale which reminds just how good an actor Sylvester Stallone is when given the right material. Having played the character five times before Stallone doesn't phone in his performance as he gives Rocky a depth we haven't seen before thanks to his great script which contains some excellent monologues, with Rocky's breakdown in front of Paulie and confrontation with his son two of the better scenes I have seen this year. With Stallone getting older I can't help but feel this movie is more than autobiographical. Indeed this is a man exorcising his demons on screen through his alter ego as Stallone does not shy away from the main issues that have drawn criticism from all corners (myself included), with the biggest issue of his age being met head on with both humor and sincerity. Burt Young is great as Paulie, firing away the often humorous one liner's with ease, while Milo Ventimiglia is a vast improvement when compared to Sage Stallone. Geraldine Hughes absolutely shines as Marie, with Stallone making a wise decision by not having Marie and Rocky fall in love. Like Rocky says, ""My wife may be gone, but she is not gone"", and I'm sure the fans will agree. The only flaw casting wise lies with Antonio Tarver who not only doesn't have the intimidating presence needed to strike fear in the hearts of the audience (much like Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago), but also lacks character. Now many would say that fault lies within the script, but I must disagree. Are you going to tell me that Ivan Drago was a well written part? That will be a big fat no, yet he was still affective. Direction wise Stallone is on top of his game. Granted there are pacing problems (especially at the start of the film) but once the Rocky theme hits and training montage begins it is pure bliss. The best scene has to be the excellent boxing match between Balboa and Dixon. Starting off as your average HBO covered fight, Stallone creates an emotionally charged slug fest complete with slow motion, black and white color palates mixed with crimson red ala 'Sin City', images of Adrian and Rocky's former trainer Mickey giving encouragement from the grave and Bill Conti's excellent, driving score which in all honestly had me a complete mess at it's conclusion. This is great film making which grabs you by the heart and does not let go. Rocky fans will know what I'm talking about. With six films in 30 years Stallone has created a world which we have in trusted ourselves emotionally. From running up the steps at the Philadelphia Museum to his re-match against Clubber Lang to Rocky kissing his wife's headstone, we have watched the evolution of a beloved character from the highest highs to the crippling lows and back again. Cheers to Sylvester Stallone for the ultimate send off and making it all worth while.",Rocky Balboa
486,twk00,Stallone finally brings Rocky back to respectability,7,4 March 2012,"I didn't think it was possible but Sylvester Stallone made a decent movie out of this the 6th (!) Rocky film. He succeeds because he returns to what made the first film great which was a touching drama featuring real characters and an uplifting story. It's a nice little movie about family, getting old, and standing up for the things you believe in. It's utterly predictable but it works thanks to the heartfelt performance by Stallone. It's the best in the series since Rocky 2 and a fitting end to the Rocky story. Who knew a movie about a 60-something Rocky could actually be pretty good?

In Rocky V she was looking decidedly haggered and that was 15 years ago.I would actually give it 6.5 out of 10 not the best in the series, I like Rocky IV, but definitely better than III and V but its a good watch and a fitting end for a true movie legend.",Rocky Balboa

There are so many emotional aspects of this movie it would be difficult to name them all. Basically, if anyone is a real Italian Stallion fan, you must see this - especially in the theater.

But, hey, this is the movies, this is ROCKY and you believe this could happen! Hearing the Bill Conti score build throughout the movie is a great Blast From The Past, as well.

Basically, if you saw the trailer - you saw everything that this bore of a movie has to offer. Obviously if you have the slightest idea about what Rocky movies are about, you won't have any doubts that final 20 minutes would be the actual climax but honestly, before final fight there's absolutely nothing to watch, which means over an hour of waiting for R.B. to just get his old, HGH-pumped-up body to the ring and give you something for your money! So you just try to wait through some meaningless events and dilemmas from retired boxer's life, knowing that anything interesting can only happen in the ring. But there's only one fight, which result you're not really interested in because you deeply know that no matter what's going to happen, Rocky will be the moral winner... And anybody who knows anything about boxing will tell you that it's not quite the authenticity of boxing sequences that make Rocky films watchable, it's the drama. Don't look for it here though because there's none. The screenplay looks like it's been written very quickly by not a very talented person or somebody who just doesn't care.

I went expecting something better than 5 but not as good as the rest. I came out thinking it was better than 3,4, and 5. It went back to Rocky's roots. They tried going back in the 5th movie but it didn't work out. I think people needed to be without Rocky for a while so they bring him back more like the original. This movie was exactly like Rocky ( the original) but 30 years later. The end was the same and the story is very similar. I think that this movie is a great way to end the Rocky Saga. Stallone may have saved his career with this performance. Rocky Balboa is one of the Years most entertaining movies, although it is shorter and there isn't as much hype before the fight as in the rest it is still great i give it a 10 out of 10.

If you are an 80's child, and you were there in 1976 when Rocky first stepped in to the ring and captured your heart with his courage, faith and unrelenting persistence against the odds, then you know that ROCKY is simply part of your cultural DNA. If you were raised in a cave and are going out to see Rocky Balboa as a stand alone movie, and you are not connected to the emotional history most of us have with the character, then you are going to feel that this movie is an overdone, sentimental, not very realistic story of a over the hill boxer. You won't really ""get"" it, and you won't be nominating it for any Oscars. However, if you have ROCKY in your blood, then instead of being turned off, you will feast on all the nostalgia and heart-felt speeches, you will glow with pride to see the Italian Stallion in his gray sweats charging up the steps once again with his mangy mutt, you will look lovingly upon the lines and wrinkles in Stallone's 60 year old face, and when he steps into the ring with the younger, stronger, cocky champion, that ""Go Rocky!"" feeling from long ago will rise in you once again, because you know he's not going down in the first round. You know the young buck is about to get a lesson in GOING THE DISTANCE. The point of this film is not to showcase critically acclaimed acting, writing or direction. It's more an emotional tribute to the original spirit of the Rocky movie - a visit with an old friend, an ode to all that Rocky stands for in our culture -- to believe in yourself, to follow your dreams against the odds, that the true meaning of heart is not in the getting knocked down but in the getting up again. In this, it succeeds beautifully and if you love Rocky and wanted more, you get it and leave the theater very satisfied.Some will say it's cheesy. Whatever. Go home health food nuts. This cheese is DELICIOUS, who doesn't LOVE cheese?",Rocky Balboa
496,MrBlonde01,Rocky kicks arse,10,19 January 2007,"I just saw this movie in the cinema, it is awesome, and not just because its a Rocky film, cinematographically its actually quite an achievement for Sly Stalone. If your a Rocky fan or not, (I my self must say that i am not the biggest Rocky fan) this is still an amazing movie don't be put off because its boxing, some of the scenes actually show a human side to Rocky, he's not just a hero wrapped in an American flag, he's an emotionally unbalanced man, but the fight scene still rocks, it seriously kicks arse. Sly's not the best actor in the world and he never will be, but he plays Rocky perfectly. I say bring on RamboIV!",Rocky Balboa
497,alex_83132,Just great!,9,12 January 2007,"This movie is really about Rocky Balboa's life after his boxing career. No doubt that even as a sixty year old man, he's still the same old Italian Stallion.If you enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this one as well. Although, there has been some bad films between the two, this one is truly what I will call a great Rocky film. They focus more on the story this time, and Balboa's speeches actually makes sense compared to the previous ones. Sylvester Stallone has done a good job, not only for his directorial work, but also for his marvelously acting. Best I've seen him, ever! I always love the music related to the Rocky Balboa series, it makes you feel like you're part. As mention above, ""Rocky VI"" is different from the other Rocky movies (exept the first one). However, they also have a lot in common. For example, all the classic moments and theme/soundtracks are included, witch I think Rocky wouldn't have been much without.Well delivered ROCKY!",Rocky Balboa

She became a black belt a year ago but never quite found the ""heart"" that she needed to be the great Sensei she could be. Once again, Sly has given us a film to inspire us. I shed a few tears over both of us getting older (smile) but I'm so thankful for the legend of films and so happy he made the finale one that is touching, loving, and full of hope. I've coveted boxing and the martial arts since I was child. My father taught me to understand the soul of a fighter even though I was a girl. I grew up watching Ali and Sugar Ray. I'm also thankful for the Contender series because it gives a new audience an understanding of a sport that is generally misunderstood. Even if you're not a boxing fan there is something for everyone in this picture women and men. Enjoy!",Rocky Balboa
499,chrshindle,excellent - Stallone's best for years,10,11 January 2007,"I've been itching to see this film since hearing Sly was making another. at first i was a little worried that we'd be getting another Rocky 5 but how wrong was I.I've always been a Fan of Sly, he is one of my childhood hero's, his last few films have been a little crappy and i was preying that the Rocky series would end on a High.Stallone has pulled this off, the story continues after the death of adrian, Rocky is a very unhappy man, missing Adrian and spending his nights at his restaurant Adrians telling punters Fight story's and posing for photo's. Rocky is a lost soul, deeply unhappy and feeling like he's living in the past.I won't tell anymore of the story, but the writing and acting is superb, the fight scene at the end has real atmosphere and really does Rocky justice.This is a fantastic Film, see it, see it today.",Rocky Balboa
500,antoniofnikolai,"Rocky, is one an only",9,28 March 2007,"My comment for the movie is that the last Rocky Balboa movie was the best I have ever seen. I also liked the episode that Rocky goes to fight in cold Russia against a boxer who is like a machine. Sylvester Stalone in an age that is difficult to do such movies showed why he is a great actor of Hollywood. I liked also in the movie the realism that was in the fight of Balboa against Mayson Dixon. It was like a real box fight. The only thing negative about the movie is that, it's been created after years. I wish I could see Stalone face to face because like an actor is one of the best. Keep Going Sylvester I 'm with you and good luck with the movie of Rambo.",Rocky Balboa
501,tonyibrahim,Rocky Balboa brings the audience so much closer to the character.,10,23 January 2007,"Sylvester Stallone puts a great story line to work in Rocky Balboa! With age, Stallone has matured and has managed to soundly add a level of realism foreign to the previous Rocky installments. In Rocky Balboa, we see a much wiser Rocky whose humility reaches out and touches the audience on a whole new level.The film's evocative nature is nurtured through the implementation of appropriate stylistic techniquesa feature not as effective in his previous films. Cinematographically, the film is composed so much better than the film's predecessors. However, he never once floods Rocky Balboa with excessive CGI, leaving room for the film's beautiful storyline to simply resonate with its audience. . Rocky Balboa is presented as the most realistic Rocky film. Stallone positions his aged character against a withering body, a media frenzy aiming to dishearten our beloved champion and the death of many loved characters. He is in a position where his opponent in the ring fights just as hard as life does, however he still has the heart to fight back.Overall, Rocky Balboa is a great success. It is a film that will entertain a wide range of audiences, and will resonate with each person for a long time to come.Tony Ibrahim",Rocky Balboa
502,bunkerforever,Stallone pulls it off!,9,30 December 2006,"Up until recently most people considered a sixth Rocky to be a huge joke due to Sly's age and the series decline with the previous two films. But he manages to take Rocky back to his roots way more successfully this time with Rocky Balboa.Right from the opening scenes Stallone lets you know that this film will be more of a character piece. We find Rocky still grieving over the loss of Adrian from a few years ago. He now runs a restaurant called Adrian's and on the anniversary of her death he visits many of the sites that meant something to the two of them. Its in these scenes where we see Rocky at his most vulnerable. He's lost the most important person in his life and he still hasn't learned how to cope with it. Shortly after that he runs into the grown up Marie who was the 12 year old Rocky lectured in the first film.Stallone and Geraldine Hughes(Marie) have pretty good chemistry together. Marie becomes more of a new companion for Rocky and not necessarily a new love interest. Rocky also befriends her biracial son Steps. We also see some scenes dealing with Rocky and his son Robert. The two have a bit of a strained relationship because Robert feels like he's living in his father's shadow. This part of the film is a little clichéd but thankfully it doesn't take up too much time.As usual Rocky's brother in law Paulie(Burt Young) pops up for the comic relief. Paulie's a bitter old alcoholic in this film but he's still there for his pal Rocky in the end.About half way through we are shown a computer simulation fight aired on ESPN which has an in his prime Rocky facing the current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon played by former light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver. The results are that Rocky would've won by knockout in the 13th round. Once Rocky hears about this he gets the urge to come out of retirement to fight in small time bouts again. Of course this leads to Rocky facing the current champion for real in an exhibition bout.The second half of the film is the best where Rocky has to decide whether to accept the offer from Dixon's promoters or not. There is a great scene between him and Marie which results in him making his decision.The training montage is easily the shortest of the Rocky series but still manages to get you all pumped up for the fight.The fight itself is probably the most realistic of all the Rockys. Sure it has its over the top moments but Stallone sets it up to look like it's actually being shown on HBO. And you can clearly see on several occasions that both Stallone and Antonio Tarver did connect with some of their punches.In the end Rocky Balboa gives a similar message to that of the first film. It is winning isn't everything but what matters most is that you just do your best to succeed in life.I'd rank Rocky Balboa along with Rocky II as the best of the sequels. I consider myself a big Rocky/Stallone fan and this film surpassed my expectations. It may not be an Oscar contender but it is still one of the best films I've seen this year. Even if you are not a fan of the Rocky sequels but do like the first film this one is a must see.",Rocky Balboa
503,itjchawke,It's not often that the end of a classic series is complimented as greatly as this.,8,26 June 2008,"Rocky Balboa is a great movie, after so many sequels, some good, some bad, everybody has their favourites and those they bought just to fill the collection. But Rocky Balboa brings the meaning back to the films that got lost throughout its many sequels and focuses on the feelings and mindset of it's main character.The legendary career Rocky is over, the glamour is gone and he is left owning and running a small restaurant reminiscing over past glory. The story is that of the urge for one last match, the last chance of getting in the spotlight and its irresistible attraction to a former world champion. Stallone delivers a remarkable performance perfectly mimicking the character of Rocky he first played 30 years ago. The story line is simple and predictable; you know what's going to happen before you even put the DVD in the player, but that never stopped any of the Rocky sequels before and should not be used to criticise this film either.I would recommend this film to anyone; however I would recommend watching at least the first Rocky film in order to appreciate Stallone's performance and the effort that has gone into making this film an excellent conclusion to the series.",Rocky Balboa
504,chisum2,The best of the Rocky films,10,22 January 2007,"I expected to see ( in this day and age) another dreary pointless sequel, but being a fan of Rocky the last 4 sequels were great. My two eldest boys wanted to see this film after watching all the other Rocky films on DVD and after watching the half hour special of the U.K premier, I thought why not, let's go and I wasn't disappointed. Sly Stallone stated in this half hour special that this one was more emotional and he wasn't wrong. Usually when I watch a film it takes a while to get into and then if something emotional happens it's halfway through or near the end as a pick me up for the main character, but the emotions hit right from the start. When Rocky was visiting old haunts he and Adrian used to go to, through to Rocky's speech to the boxing commission to the actual fight, This film is the best of the Rocky films, shame it's the last. Excellent movie.",Rocky Balboa
505,british_bpm,Sly - Talents wasted here,3,4 December 2006,"I recently saw a sneak preview of this film and it left me with an overwhelming sense of being cheated out of a good movie. It struck me at how good an actor Sly is, but how much he wastes his talents acting out clunky scripts of his own making, with absurd story lines directed in a cumbersome manner in which his co - stars seem fixed in an apparent state rigid confusion. There are so many ways this film could have been better. But I feel it's main problem lies in it's absurd, and dare I say it laughable pretext. I fear the script may succeed at one level of analysis however; An exploration of how much Rocky Balboa & Sly Stallone's careers seem to echo one another perhaps? In turn, I hope this move has exorcised SS's ""beast within"" as well as RB's. No amount of feeble under nourished sub plots playing out dubious story devices can get this film away from being a total pantomime by the end. Imagine a story of Rocky coming out of retirement and playing in seedy local fights inter cut with footage of the brilliantly executed fights in the first film, his new triumphs no less than what went before. Imagine Rocky fighting brain damage, or Parkinson's like Ali. How gripping that would be? We've all grown up, we can handle it.... But this one plays out a limping personal journey encumbered by an ocean of sentimental syrup coming to rest finally on a denouement that left jabs direct to the brow.... the low brow. And herein lies a problem; I fear even the hardest core of Rocky fans will find this movie painfully slow. With no real embracing of the franchise construct occurring well into reel 4, only one fight, and oddly enough, a painfully poorly shot presentation therein. For artistic reasons understood, but badly executed in both it's lighting, edit and grade, the entire film switches to video for the final fight and instead of this coming across as edgy it just gives the whole thing a cheap, understated, and anticlimactic feel. With poor sound, and an oddly mixed score that gives nothing to the scale of the surroundings. It sadly sets a bar so low it's off the radar with fight sequences found in the likes of Raging Bull, Rocky, Fight Club and Snatch (I'm sure I'm missing many others). I saw this at arguably one of the best screens in London with a second to none sound system running DTS, and it was not good. The final shot in Las Vegas, a poorly selected video still that looks messy and plastic compared to it's predecessors. Which, for me is indicative of how this film feels compared to the first brilliant outing all those years ago. I am left with one hope however, that a really fantastic writer and or director will see this movie and see the potential untapped font of acting talent Sly Stallone has bubbling away under his boxing belt and gets him a project that affords Sly the recognition he deserves for services to the movie trade and reverses all the damage he has done to his own career through misguided adventures in auterism.",Rocky Balboa
506,JeffIrvin,Excellent,9,30 December 2006,"When I first heard Sly was doing another Rocky I was pretty sure it would be a massive pile of dog pooh. Was I ever wrong. It totally captured the spirit of the first two films. It felt raw and real. They even brought back the original music! I've read a few reviews that said the first hour of the movie was slow and that they should of had more boxing and more training. I have to completely disagree. Seeing Rocky as an old guy running a small restaurant, grieving over the loss of his wife, just wanting to be part of his son's life ... it makes Rock real. Many of us can relate in someways to what he is going through. He is everyone of us in someway or another. And I think that is why the first two Rocky's are far superior than 3-5. If you loved Rocky you have to go see this. It gives us fans the closure we never got from Rocky V.",Rocky Balboa
507,farhans,"The most over used word ""Incredible""",10,10 March 2007,"Let me first start by saying, I've watched any of the Rocky movies until this one. All I knew about Rocky movies was the sound tracks like ""Eye of the Tiger"" and ""Burning Heart"". Anyway, coming to the point, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I mean, if you see it like this, it should be just a boxing movie...or a any other movie based on a sporting event, in which there is a underdog side, and the more up-to-the-challenge one. So, there will be no change in the formula. Well, that is right. The same goes for Rocky balboa. But there was something else. I read the reviews and most of them were good, but all that couldn't prepare me enough for what I was about to witness in that movie. This is the movie with a heart. Something that you'd like yourself to be reassured time after time. It was basically a boxing movie and the climax certainly was the fight. But there was a build to that. There was nothing new to really, just some new reassurances and affirmation, that they keep projecting in almost every other movie these days. But don't be fooled by that. To me the most important thing in this movie was its characters. They all stood out. Not only, that there were some exceptionally good performances from Sylvester Stallone and the rest of the cast, but there were these dialogs, witty one-liners and all that. And though the score was a little off-base (and sometimes, just plain irritating), it didn't take away a lot from this beautiful movie.Its a movie that you want to watch over and over again and you wanna watch it with your friends and family. I watched it last night and watched again this morning and I'm planning to watch it again with my best friend and my girl friend.My opinion, watch the movie with high expectation and all of those will be rewarded.",Rocky Balboa
508,UCFMan29,A perfect ending to an inspirational character!,8,14 December 2006,"Hey guys, I had the pleasure of attending the Orlando screening of ""Rocky Balboa"" last night and I'm still in awe this morning of how good the film actually is. This is the perfect ending to a series and a character that has embodied the American and ""underdog"" spirit.Let me first start off by saying this is probably Sly's best performance since the original 'Rocky.' The flow of emotions he goes through is incredible. His performance is definitely Oscar worthy, however we all know that is going to be a long shot. The three major speeches he gives throughout the film nearly brought tears to my eyes because you can see the genuine ""goodness"" in this man's eyes.The movie itself is a great examination of the human spirit and the how a man goes about putting his life back together after having lost the one he loves the most. Burt Young gives a great performance and delivers some of the best and funniest lines in the film. Milo Ventimiglia is good as Rocky's son with the little material he has to work with. Geraldine Hughes is very good as Marie as is her son played by James Francis Kelly. The only negative thing I would say is that I thought there could've been even more character development between Robert, Marie, and Steps.Antonio Tarver is a decent opponent and seems fairly natural as an actor. Like most people have said, he's not the typical Rocky villain. There's purpose to him wanting to fight as well and although he's not a sympathetic character, there's not that hatred you had with Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago.The training sequence was awesome, although it was a bit short. The fight itself was different than any other Rocky film. It was broadcast like a real HBO fight and Sly uses some very cool camera angles and shots to stylize it. Very entertaining.I won't give anything away but I think you guys will be all be satisfied when you see this film. Sly has done Rocky justice and brought him full-circle.

509,GroovyDave1973,A must see! (very-minor spoilers),10,22 December 2006,"When I first heard of this project I thought ""Oh no, not another like Rocky 5!"". How wrong I was. This film is so unRocky like and indeed, probably unAmerican, in that it is very understated. We see Rocky come to terms with Adrian's death, a new romance that we can see blossoming or maybe not, we see Paulie and how he copes with redundancy, a heavyweight champion who is struggling for respect and how Rocky junior lives in the shadow of his fathers name. Funnily enough even though we are expected to believe that Rocky in his 50's is fighting the world heavyweight champion I found this the most believable Rocky film. The fight scene's like the film were understated and fairly true to life and he is not fighting an unbelievable monster like Clubber or Drago.Fans of the Rocky series should definitely see this film and even people who are not Rocky fans will like this as it's so character driven. The acting performances too are reserved and believable, Geraldine Hughes as Marie is fantastic. The film I can only describe as comedy-romance with a decent bit of boxing thrown in at the end. A great film to take your girl to, a sentimental trip and a great way to round the Rocky series off.It's the best film I have seen this year, and I was not expecting it, I love when films do that!

510,Gazza77,Great Final Round to a classic series!,9,29 January 2007,"After the debacle that was Rocky V, many Rocky fans had a bitter taste in their mouths. Stallone decided that V was the final word and by God, it was an ugly way to go.So to make up for V, Stallone decided to give it one final go. To give an icon like Rocky a goodbye he deserves it not an easy thing to do since the older Rocky gets, the less believable his character would be when he gets back in the ring, right? Wrong.Rocky Balboa is an introspective ( and retrospective) ending to one of the true great icons of the 80's. Stallone deserves all the credit for writing this movie. Sure, it is about boxing. But more importantly, this movie is about loving life. 'Don't let anybody tell you what you are worth. Go out and get what you're worth.' The character Rocky lives by this credo and in this concluding chapter, we open our hearts once more to the Rocky we have all come to know and love. This movie is a movie from the heart.

511,Wolfman1181,A Poetic Conclusion,9,22 January 2007,"I was two years away from entering the world when Rocky was originally released in 1979, but in the twenty five years since my birth I've probably seen it at least 50 times. My attraction to these movies is not the action, its not the cheesy 80's training montage music (which is incredible by the way), its a connection I have with the main character. From the very first time I saw the film I felt this bond, and its only grown stronger over the years, he is like a close friend of mine, and I am always wishing for the very best for him. No matter how cheesy the story lines may have gotten over the years, the bond with the character was forged in the first 2 hours of the saga. No matter how great, or how poor the sequels were, they would never stand next to the first, and I happen to love the sequels also, II and IV in particular. That is until December of 2006, 27 years after the first movie created a bond with people on so many levels, Rocky Balboa delivers in the only way it could've worked. It is a character piece focusing on his struggles with all that he's endured, and all; he has left. That lovable ""big dummy"" that we all fell for in the first film is back, and I would be honored if I could have a friend like Rocky Balboa. As for the fight in this film, it was pretty standard Rocky material, but that wasn't what this film was about, it was about closure, finishing out the right way, and not the way he left our minds in the 90's, all punch drunk and completely unrecognizable from the Rocky we all knew. He is back to finish it off the way only Rocky knows how, and thats with love and compassion, if you would all look back at the first film, you will see what I mean. Congratulations Sly Stallone, you've finished a great story the only way I could've asked for.",Rocky Balboa
512,joshbails,Rocky Balboa...why?,6,21 December 2006,"I heard Stallone comment that he wasn't happy with V ending the Rocky series so I guess that is as good a reason as any. This film almost treats II-V like they didn't exist with almost all references and flashbacks to the original. I actually think Stallone went a little overboard with memories and characters from the first film.The beginning is slow and sad but it really communicated where Rocky was in his life, a man holding on to the past. The middle of the film picked up some speed based on Rocky's new motivation, and the fight was as good as any other Rocky movie. Some long scenes with angry speeches worked and some were kind of dumb. Rocky's opponent Mason 'the line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver) did a much better job than I would have suspected from a boxer trying to act which was a welcome surprise.I still don't think this movie was needed to conclude the series (I think Rocky V is a good conclusion and underrated) but it was entertaining and worthy of a look.",Rocky Balboa

Stallone put forth a lot of effort to get this movie out and it shows in the final product. the movie was great and possibly the best since the original. it's a great movie for the entire family to see. but please, whatever you do, don't knock it until you have seen it. it is a pleasant surprise for a movie franchise long thought dead.",Rocky Balboa

I wasn't moved by them but neither did I wish them off the screen. Burt Young and Sylvester Stallone had tears coming down my cheeks in some parts of the movie because of their stirring performances, and that's really hard to accomplish with me.

Sylvester Stallone finally did a phenomenal job here with Rocky Balboa. He really put his heart and soul into this project. I have always been a huge fan of the series except for Rocky 5 of course. Many may think this film isn't necessary but after seeing this film I'm sure many people opinions will change. The Rocky saga needed to end like this, so I'm very happy to say I loved this film.Rocky is the charming guy we all remember from the first time he steps on screen. His age is a huge part of why this film is successful because he becomes in his own way a wise old man in a world where heart and soul are hard to come by. Rocky has never been the smartest or the strongest but it's his heart that keeps him going.Stallone has never been known for his legendary acting chops but does the best he can do and its enough, you will love him and root him on. Everyone turns in a good performance with the only weak link being the challenger Mason Dixon. He just doesn't have the presence that Apollo Creed had or the intensity and strength of Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago. Now Burt young has always done a great job and really bringing life to the character of Paulie but in this film he really out does him self and sometime even outshines Stallone himself. Rocky Balboa isn't the best film in the series but it has just as much heart and soul as the original.

If you enjoyed the previous films then this is unmissable.Truly a triumph!",Rocky Balboa
521,rz_sain,"The true great inspirational work of the century, ROCKY",8,14 September 2007,"The true great inspirational work of the century, ROCKYThough there are many contenders to the given title like Rushmore or The Lord Of The Rings, ROCKY is the only one we've all seen happen, or rather not happen, to almost each one of us. I call the Rocky movies noble. They incite hope in us. 'Keep going' they say, 'keep going'. I think that the reason for it's greatness is that besides the actual boxing, it has little to do with boxing. It's about the boxer, it's about the guy. So these movies are not about something, they're about someone and they're about all of us. They're about human kindness, compassion, persistence, the longing to be recognized, acknowledged. They're about one man's dream and what he did about it. Now about his great finale, where all things finally come to a close. It's like a walk down memory lane. It's like revisiting your childhood home. It's personal. I, who missed all the movies between 1 and 6, felt deeply saddened by Adrian's loss, and in Rocky's few private moments by her grave, or that scene by the side of his house, I felt his loss too, almost like a loss of my own. This story is one about his final quest to, whatever he may say, do justice to himself by finding out what would otherwise haunt him till the end. I'll explain. Rocky is old now. All those wins from his past are just memories. Can he still do it now? Is he lesser a man than he used to be? So rather than condemning himself into remembering and wondering, he goes out for one final shot.So does he have to prove it to himself? Is that all? Yes. And no. His victory would not be his alone, but shared with all who matter so much to him. So would his defeat. But why doesn't he just not fight? Because he doesn't want to rot away in doubt, and because there is so damn much to fight for, and as his old friend Paulie points out, with. As a film, of course 1 was just pure brilliance, but this is not 1. This is 6. And it's still standing. Full of pleasant old surprises. I seriously recommend anyone who has not watched 1 NOT to watch this first. And of course, the score brings back memories of its own. Thank You, Mr Stallone.",Rocky Balboa
522,Siverus,"Predictable, Bad Acting....... Rocky , overall decent.",5,2 January 2007,The movie was no surprise as I knew exactly what was going to happen. Just as all of the Rocky movies it is extremely predictable in what is going to happen. The acting is not very good. The story brings in way too much irrelevant relationships with people. Overrall the movie is decent. Follows through with the other Rocky movies very well. Nothing I didn't expect. As usual he had an over confident cocky opponent. Rocky gets the hell beaten out of him at first but then starts a comeback. Only problem I had with the movie was the scores at the end of the movie. It should have been unanimous but it turned to a very close split decision. We all know Rocky got completely clobbered and the only chance he had of winning was to knock out Dixon. Overall a decent movie that any Rocky fan should enjoy!,Rocky Balboa
523,tonystalloney,Balboa shocks the World,10,14 December 2006,"Balboa is gonna hit so many people in different ways.I suppose you can look at any great film and see a message in there, but the Rocky franchise is so inspirational, even the 5th one.This new film has had me thinking, and though some reviews have said it's a trip down memory lane and a rehash of the 1st, well the point is, as reflected in the film, that Rocky IS living in the past, like so many of us do for one reason or another.The message as stated in the film ""you gotta keep moving forward"", I don't know if its me or just pure genius, but if you LOOK you will find something that touches your soul throughout the franchise ..So i wont drag this out...........I left the theatre kind of stunned. Its been a long while since Rocko got back in the ring, and I, like everyone else, wanted a better film than Rocky V. Sly has wised up a lot over the years, and all I can say is....THIS FILM DELIVERS BIG TIME !The fact that its the 6th one, and to be honest, its no sci-fi film where you can really go to town on the plot, there is only so much you can do, and Sly has done it. Yeah, you could say that the plot mirrors Sly's life over the last few years, but all the Rocky's have done that in one way or another. This is Rocky back to his sweet and charming self, stunned with what life has thrown at him, and just going through the motions of, well, growing old, but still having that ambition to kick life in the balls and say ""it ain't over til it's over"". He looks great for 60, and doesn't over train for the final bout, he's kept it very realistic, and the fight itself is handled very well, and looks different to the recent wars we have been used to. The film isn't just about boxing, it's a drama, which will inspire you, if you can put your ego to one side and let it.Paulie is fab, he calms things down and stops certain moments turning into what some people may call cheesy. Unfortunately people with no emotions call things cheesy, but they are the ones who have yet to learn what life can throw at you.This film is up there with I & II, and I need to see it again!!!!!!!!OverallA perfect ending to the saga, and an amazing turn around for the franchise.",Rocky Balboa
524,Jonny-Utah,The near perfect final bell!!,9,2 February 2007,"I have to say that I'm perhaps one of the biggest fans of the Rocky franchise, and the character is up there along with Indiana Jones for me.But having heard that sly was to make a sixth instalment however filled me with a certain amount of apprehension. First there was the concern about his age, the time elapsed between the last film i.e would the character work in 2007? How the story ended the last time around i.e where would it go from there? Saying that i did like the pathos of rocky v in that it was a rags to riches to rags story and yet rocky learns a valuable life lesson about family affection and winning that back in sacrifice for his own glory.All my concerns and apprehension about the film have been laid to rest after watching and I have to say to rocky fans you will love it and to none rocky fans you will like it more than you would expect. The first thing sly gets right here is bringing back the fundamentals that made the first and best movie so revered and loved, i.e essentially about life's hardships and own personal anxiety's, dignity and pride this is none so more evident than in the scenes between rocky and his son(milo ventaglia). After his wife Adrian has passed away, his only connection of family is with rocky jr who has become a city slicker yuppie type, embarrassed by his fathers downfall. These are quite heartfelt scenes watching rocky win back his affection.Mason 'the line' Dixon is a surprising breath of fresh air in comparison to past adversaries. Unlike the cartoon type villains Dragos, Langs etc(who do have there place in rockyland i must add) Dixon is kinda a victim of his own success, having knocked out everyone put in front of him the crowd don't aspire to him because he hasn't fought a real fighter yet. There is even a mutual affection and admiration between the two fighters without it turning into a buddy movie.The toughest thing for sly to turn around, and he does so very cleverly is the seemingly ridiculous premise of the plot. Rockys character is actually in his early fifties( as opposed to sly being 60) and Tarvers Dixon is around 34 making this a more feasible match-up. Anyone remember George Foreman making his comeback around that age? Then there's the whole idea of using real life commentators and pundits from ESPN who actually sell the event in the film as kind of a circus cum exhibition, like they would with anybody making a comeback at that age, so the film kinda makes fun of itself giving the audience a reality check which makes it all the more believable. As one pundit so blatantly snides 'its gunna be more of an execution than an exhibition' The fight itself is possibly the most realistic of the series, a testament to slys hard work on the choreography( he himself gave and took some real life hits) looking like a boxer who hasn't put on gloves in years. By the time the final bell music sounds you will have a smile on your face (even though i didn't see the ending coming)as you watch rocky depart the ring and arena for the last time. I can honestly say i had a lump in my throat. Can you go the distance for a sixth time - and believe me yes you can!! i dare you to not be entertained..",Rocky Balboa
525,star-88,Hard Truth was missed by the Youth,5,29 December 2006,"Having just seen this movie, my comment will not be appreciated by those under the age of 30! In today's world, there are just too many younger people who have no substance, preferring quantity over quality. In this movie, mostly everyone appeared to be young and exuberant. The problem is when they don't comprehend the meaning of Rocking having plenty of ""stuff"" left in his ""basement"". I liked the advice from the Champion's old-school manager in regards to self-respect. It's like the old Rocky movies where Rocky was always over matched, over powered, under skilled or ill experienced, YET, he found a way to win! I recall a line from ""Rocky 5"" where Rocky's wife, Adrian, said Rocky didn't win with physical power but with heart. Today's youth, they completely missed this part in ""Rocky Balboa"". It's not about one's age or one's physical strength but about heart, about what's in one's ""basement"". Today, many an athlete alone acts on SKILL and skill alone, never realizing to ENDURE, one has to have ""something in the basement""! As the old saying goes, that which you have INSIDE can NEVER be taken from you. To the youth who watch ""Rocky Balboa"", learn to ENDURE based on the PASSION, not just on the skill, that you may have.",Rocky Balboa

527,hitman7000,It had what Rocky embodied.....heart,8,27 December 2006,"It is still hard for me to believe that there is yet another Rocky movie out. However, the way they went about doing this movie couldn't have been a more fitting end to the franchise.Rocky, was portrayed as a lovable lunkhead, never the smartest person, but always trying to do right by people. He is a legend, a piece of Americana. If you visit Philidelphia, you would see his statue, no one embodied the human spirit, and the indomitable American will like Rocky Balboa.The movie ends believably. I won't give it away, but you walk away feeling like this could have actually happened. Therefore you aren't left with a cheesy ending, but a believable scenario which, oddly will leave you wanting more. However, this is one tale, that is better left ended this way.One more time....ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY",Rocky Balboa
528,imcamel,Stallone is back on type,10,18 December 2006,"Rocky is back! Fantastic story with the same nail biting fight scenes as the rest of the series. I was fortunate enough to be able to preview this movie before the release date. I have grown up with Rocky and have seen all of his movies in the theaters. The scenes with Rocky and his son are heartwarming, they have an amazing bond. As usual Paulie is there to add a little comic relief. Is the story realistic? Of course not. But if I wanted to see realistic stories, why would I be in a movie theater? Movies are supposed to entertain and this one does, gloves on and off. This a fantastic film for the whole family. I for one am glad that Rocky Balboa is back and on top!",Rocky Balboa
529,Joey_Sasso,everybody should know this!,10,20 December 2006,i just got back from seeing this movie. everybody was applauding during this movie and it had a 15 minute applaud after the movie ended...this is deffinitley the best rocky of all time. the story is true and this was the right time to make this movie. i don't know why everybody wants this film to fail. everybody should know that this movie is the movie from the greatest under dog saga of all time. in this movie rocky faces difficulty with everything that a boxer goes through in his life at his age...between loosing Adrian and his son being mad at him rocky faces difficulties that every day people go through. not many people get a second chance in life. rocky is the best saga of all time. people go see this movie and you will like it.who agrees with me?

530,wdonovan-3,Inspirational,9,3 August 2007,"I rented Rocky Balboa on DVD last night as it had been about 6 months since I saw it on the big screen. My initial review, having seen it in the cinema, did it a disservice. At the time, I reckoned that both the acting and script were very poor, although I enjoyed the film immensely and loved the nostalgia of it. Now I have to confess that they were just pure ROCKY through and through. This has been a fantastic franchise with all bar one (No. 5) legendary stuff. I even clicked to the Special Features on the DVD to get some of the insights of Stallone and came to be fully convinced that he is not given enough credit for his intelligence and talent as both a director AND actor. The scenes in Philadelphia during the making of the film epitomise the legacy of Rocky worldwide. People everywhere love an underdog and this character has been able to transcend what is essentially fiction to become more real than any other movie character in history. For all Rocky fans this was a fantastic way to leave the series and a masterpiece of film making. Rocky- you are a living legend.",Rocky Balboa
531,oldskoolmj,Rocky goes out swingin',8,25 March 2007,"Rocky: ""Ah come on, Adrian, it's true. I was nobody. But that don't matter either, you know? 'Cause I was thinking', it really don't matter if I lose this fight. It really don't matter if this guy opens my head, either. 'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance. Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed, and if I can go that distance, you see, and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood."" When it comes to Rocky movies, you won't find many bigger fans than me. My favorite Christmas gift this year was the ""Rocky Collection"". Unfortunately it includes ""Rocky V"", oh well! When I first heard that Slyvester Stallone was going to do another Rocky movie, I was skeptical to say the least. How could he try and do another Rocky movie? Even a big fan like myself, doesn't want to see another sub-par Rocky film. As previews started to play on TV and I heard more about it, I started thinking ""it might not be that bad!"" To get myself pumped for the release, I watched the previous five all over again on OnDemand. I even dug out my Rocky soundtrack on vinyl and blasted that to get excited about seeing the new one.Wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and sporting a black winter hat- just like ""The Italian Stallion"" I went to see it. Man, I really liked this movie!!! I liked it so much, I changed my 2006 best movie list to include it (sorry Marky Mark, you got bumped, only room for one movie about an underdog from Philly!). ""Rocky Balboa"" feels like the first two, kinda low budget and very grainy. What made Rocky such an icon is the fact that it felt so real, so relatable. That's what makes this new and last installment so good.Rocky is back in the old neighborhood and owns a restaurant named after his recently passed wife Adrian. It was weird watching a Rocky movie without Adrian. He's retired, doesn't have a close relationship with his son and only has Paulie to keep him company. His conversation with his son about ""Sunshines and Rainbows"" speaks to why everyone loves Rocky. He's one of the more endearing characters ever on screen. Of all of the Rocky movies, the boxing ""villain"" in this movie is the weakest. Mason ""The Line"" Dixon is champion and has alienated boxing fans by not beating talented boxers. I don't need to tell you what happens next.Without saying to much about the movie, Rocky regains his pride and gets back in the ring and proves he is still a ""fighter"". It's really a fitting end to a great movie saga. Sly, who wrote and directed ""Rocky Balboa"", went back to the roots with this final Rocky movie. To bad George Lucas didn't use this formula for his ""Star Wars"" prequels.If you like Rocky, you should really enjoy this one. This movie made me want to go and run up some stairs afterwards. There is nothing like that theme song. Once you hear that ""Rocky Song"", you know it's time for Rocky to get in shape and whoop some ass! It's just awesome to see him on the big screen again! Big up Sly for bringing back Rocky and giving him some dignity on the way out. Rocky, you're not ""just another bum from the neighborhood""!",Rocky Balboa

533,simduf,Just like an old leather jacket!,7,20 December 2006,"Alright, I can hear it from here. There's a little more talk and a little less action than we would expect from anything bearing the ""Rocky"" name. I think if you limit your perception to that, you won't enjoy what's really going on.The first hour of the film is like slipping in that pair of jeans or leather jacket in the back of your closet. It's a real treat to go back to basics. All the characters basically need to be re- introduced cause new faces show up and old ones have been around the block since we've last seen them. Not quite a build up for the climax, just like chatting with your friends at a school reunion. I suppose some could squirm in their seats, missing the excitement of a younger Rocky pounding Ivan, but trust me, the battle is worth the wait. You know it's a film but the visual aesthetics almost give it a feel of reality that makes it exciting. People were cheering in the audience! Awesome!!My main negative comment is that I found the overdid the whole ""living in the past"" thing, making the intro stall a bit. I would have skipped some of the flashback sequences and one or two or Stallone's soliloquy to add a bit of sparring in a greasy gym before Rocko takes on Vegas. I think they wanted to keep the revelation of Stallone's physique for the showdown but it would have been cool if there had been a bit more progression between aging restaurant owner, cut to 5 minutes of lifting weights, cut to a major event in Sin city. Just my .02$Really enjoyed. Not perfect, but we forgive cause....well....cause it's Rocky! A conservative 7/10.-S",Rocky Balboa

535,Dave_Gledhill,Rocky Balboa - A Review.,8,25 December 2006,"Who is the greatest? Who is the best of all time? This is the question that pulls Rocky Balboa out of retirement one last time.Thirty years ago, a film about an underdog fighter from Philadelphia rocked the world with the heart, grit and determination of its namesake's desire to succeed.Now, the bell chimes for the long awaited final round of the Rocky saga. Many, including myself, were disillusioned by the lazy and tired outing of Rocky V. Stallone himself was as nervous as his audience to learn how his redemption piece would be received on December 20th this year at its premiere.As a true fan of the Rocky series, I am pleased to say that the sixth installment definitely goes the distance.In stark contrast to the latter Rocky films, ""Rocky Balboa"" heads back to its Philadelphia roots and concentrates on character development and dialogue rather than flashy training sequences and a barely concealed morale showcase.Stallone - Sixty in real life, does not receive the Hollywood make-over treatment and this serves to add gravity and emotion to the ex-champions last outing in the scarred and weary face of Rocky Balboa. Rather than suspending disbelieve, the film focuses on reality and makes no secret that Rocky is past his prime.Where this film shines through is in the excellent script (again written and directed by Stallone) and its emphasis on its characters. A strong supporting cast (Pauly, Duke, Marie) add much needed depth to Balboa's story and Stallone himself plays the haunted, grief filled, past-obsessed widower to great effect.As the film builds to its dramatic conclusion, the comparisons to the original 1976 blockbuster are apparent to both the casual viewer and hardcore fans alike and as such should appeal to both movie buffs and Rocky followers in unison.In addition to its excellent script, character acting and ability to once again capture the imagination of its audience, ""Balboa"" also has the powerful original score from Bill Conti, and it is this, along with the emotionally charged dialogue that will keep you hooked until the very last punch.Whether you are a fan of the original, or, are merely curious as to whether Stallone can resurrect a legacy after sixteen years, I urge you to see this film.Stallone has managed to carry the Balboa story to a dignified and human ending, and for that, I say ""It ain't over, till its over"".Are you ready for a rematch?....Dave Gledhill 2006.",Rocky Balboa
536,joepc3,An Emotional Farewell,10,20 December 2006,"A couple of years ago, I started hearing the rumors. I started seeing and listening to the whispers on the internet. Like most things on the internet i took it in and listened, but did not fully believe, even though I would give anything to believe it was true. Slyvester Stallone had finished writing a sixth installment to his rocky series, and he was looking for buyers. As a life long fanatic, I could'nt have been more excited about the posssibility. Years went buy. Rumors came that is was a done deal and there would be another one, then those were squashed with rejections and jokes about the idea. Then last November, Christmas came early. Stallone finally sold his script, and it was on for one final round. The next year felt like one of the longest of my life, as i fantasized and dreamed of actually sitting in a movie theater watching a rocky movie. Those months were well worth the wait, as i just got home from opening night.I was surprised to see all the rocky fans at the movie theater. It seems they were touched just like me, and were just as anxious. I don't want to get into full details of the movie, but let me just tell you, I have never felt so moved walking out of a movie theater. As you sat there you experienced every emotion you could feel in a movie. I laughed, I cried, I felt joy, I experienced nervousness, and at the end felt hope, but also a happy emptiness that i knew this would be my last rocky experience in a theater. Rocky has been a huge part of my life, and I don't think I will ever feel emotions, as I felt for Rocky Balboa. Thanks for the memories Rock, We Did It!",Rocky Balboa
537,BonX,They saved the worst for last!!!!,1,25 December 2006,"After watching Rocky Balboa I was in awe. I was speechless. I could not believe that a movie praised by critics everywhere could be so disappointing. I know all of you are going to see this movie regardless of this comment simply because the Rocky franchise has yet to disappoint, but please bare with me. If and when you do see this, I strongly recommend you watch it on DVD or download it off torrent spy when it becomes available for the following reasons: This movie does not come close to the caliber of any of the previous Rocky installments. Unlike all of the other Rocky movies, there is little, if any, actual inspiration in this movie. Rocky Balboa is filled with horrendous acting and terrible dialog. Stallone's acting is atrocious. Half of the things he says you would often find yourself laughing at how stupid they were. The plot line is also awful. There was absolutely no need to make a lousy 6th Rocky movie, besides the obvious reason of making money. Rocky did not need to fight again to prove ""something"" to himself. He already beat his protégé in the 5th movie, what more is there to prove? In conclusion, I found this movie terrible in all aspects. Lousy acting and inadequate dialog contributed to the failure of this 6th and final Rocky movie.",Rocky Balboa

That order has changed now that I have seen such a triumph as Rocky Balboa. Superbly acted by all involved. Only a few slow portions of the film. Go in to see this film geared for a drama because, at its heart, that is what it is. Refreshingly, that is what most Rocky films are. This film demonstrates heart more than might. Heart is something we all need to be reminded of in our gessellschaft existences. It is an entertaining hour and a half that you will not be sorry for spending eight dollars to see.

539,austininsonoma,Embodies the Rocky spirit.,10,22 December 2006,"The first thing i need to say is that i'm a Rocky fan. I could go on and try to explain how much those movies (especially the first one) changed my life. And i need whoever reads this to understand how much it meant for me to be able to see a Rocky movie in theaters. The last one came out when i was 1 year old, so i missed it. But when i heard about this movie, which was about three years ago, i was overwhelmed.So, about Rocky Balboa. I was nervous. I've grown to have such a connection with the Rocky character, that i was worried the movie might not leave the series on a good note. But once the trailers and reviews started coming out, i became more relaxed.I just saw the film about half an hour ago. And overall, i'm very satisfied. I'm pleased to see Stallone was able to truly capture the message of Rocky, and apply it to this movie in a way that the other sequels couldn't.It has heart. Lots of it. And Stallone does the best acting job probably since the first Rocky. However, there were some parts of the movie that i'm disappointed about. Believe me, it pains me to say it, because i truly do love these movies. But i can't let that overshadow the fact that this movie wasn't perfect. The music at times is not what it should have been. Don't get me wrong, Stallone does use it for the better at many times in the film, but sometimes it's a bit overkill, and i felt that he really should have stuck to the complete original scores by Bill Conti. Not newer versions of them. Then there's the fight. I won't give anything about it away, and it does end in a satisfying way. But overall, the ending fight, which was usually the strongest part of the movie, is the weakest. It's filmed like an actual HBO match, which in my opinion, isn't a good idea. Stallone should have made the fight more like the fights in the last movies. They were void of distracting crowd shots and focused more on what was happening in the ring. Here, the camera work is distracting, and the cut scenes aren't very Rocky-like. But like i said, overall it's satisfying. And it really does hurt me to say that, because i'm a very big fan. But i can't lie about it and say it was great.So overall, the movie is good. Good acting, good revisiting of the character. And a great overall message which ends the series on a much better note than Rocky V. (which i don't think is as bad as people say...still not good though) So fans of Rocky, see this movie. You'll be happy.",Rocky Balboa
540,talcol,Rocky Should Have Stayed in Retirement,3,17 January 2007,"I didn't go into the movie with great expectations but I was hoping for a little better than what I saw. In addition to a depressing and unimaginative story line, the whole movie drug on to an unremarkable closing. Most of the younger viewers in the theater, a majority of which weren't even born when the Rocky movies premiered, had trouble staying interested in following the movie. I was diasspointed with the movie overall and wouldn't recommend it to anybody. I was bored through most of the movie and felt that it could have been better written to at least provide the spirited entertainment of the previous Rocky movies. It was a tough job to begin with,attempting to make another sequel, but I found it lacking from start to finish. Sometimes it's better not to keep beating a dead horse and just go out on a good note. It's time for Rocky to hang up his gloves and leave old fans to enjoy good memories Rocky's glory days. Sorry Sly, I just thought it was a disappointment!",Rocky Balboa
541,pnikari,A Whole Lotta Tears,7,29 January 2007,"My goodness this movie made me cry! All the other Rocky movies with the emotional scenes almost got me but I seriously cried when Rocky is looking back at his memories with Adrian...I give this a 7 out of 10 because there wasn't a huge training scene like most of the movies but it was very good. I liked it a little better than 5 because you see how hard Rocky is trying, and what really got me is his love for Adrian. When Adrian died of cancer I thought, this is so retarded! Adrian is the best character!! But then I realized that there is a reason why she's gone, although it's still depressing. The best part of the movie is, how much Rocky dedicates his time to see Adrian. I thought it was absolutely cute to see him create a restaurant named, ""Adrian's"". It just made me feel so happy that he put up pictures so of her everywhere. Paulie is still the same ol' guy, but he doesn't' like to here Rocky talk about his sister and him together. I'm a huge Rocky fan so seeing it come back to light is a great thing for me. I'm also very impressed how Sylvester Stallone (Sly) kept his shape, I mean the man was like 59 in that movie so he's in great shape, I don't know if he only did it for the movie but I was really impressed. Overall, the movie will make you cry, laugh, and smile. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Rocky Balboa
542,ldr321,A truly hollow flick,3,7 April 2007,"There was nothing to this movie except a retelling of all of the other Rocky films with just an older Stallone. The relationships with his son and the new Adrian-type gal were clichés, and everything else was formulaic: Take a fighter who's frustrated, shape him up, get him in the ring, etc., etc. The one truly outstanding thing in this movie was Stallone's face. Yow! He now really looks like a monster. How many injections and surgeries has this guy's face endured? At certain angles his face honestly looks like cadaver shots at crime scenes, absolutely no lie. Sad that the guy can't just put it all to bed and rest on his past achievements, and take his aging in stride.",Rocky Balboa
543,ImmortalBJJ,Rocky Balboa is back in the best movie of the year,10,20 December 2006,"This was such a good film. It was seriously one of the best out of all the Rocky movies, coming second to maybe only the first one. It had everything you could want from a Rocky movie and filled the what was missing from the fifth film. There was never a dull moment and not once did I find myself drifting away from the screen. It was AWESOME! I went in the theater anticipating a great movie and left considering it to be the best Rocky of the entire saga. It was so well made. Stallone seriously brought his A game for this one. It had a nice mix of old school with a new mix of something else. It was very dramatic, and never over the top. And the thing I really love about the Rocky movies is that they bring true inspiration to its viewers in a down to earth way, and ""Rocky Balboa"" fills that standard with true class. You have to see it.",Rocky Balboa
544,inquisitortam,Impressive,9,21 December 2006,"Unlike the cookie-cutter styles of Rocky III and Rocky IV (patterned after Rocky II), Rocky Balboa goes back to the roots of the series. The original Rocky was about life. It was about a guy trying to make it in the world. It was about a guy who may not be the smartest guy on the block, but at least he always tries to do the right thing. This is the route Stallone goes the new one.There were so many scenes where I sat back and said ""Good. This is something a parent should do."" or ""Good. I'm glad someone else sees that there are problems like this in today's society."" Stallone not only addresses problems but uses Rocky (in a way only Rocky can) to show that there are real solutions to these problems.This movie successfully mixes the ""heart"" with some of the stuff we all grew to love with Rocky II. It's got some incredibly funny scenes (and 1-liners) and it's got the beloved boxing match. In addition to all of that, it has a very modern feel - so something that I think helps people relate to it a bit more.As someone said (and I can't possibly put any better), the movie is ""uplifting"". It shows us that there are good people in the world with good solutions, rather than the angry solutions we saw out of many 90's movies. The flick is definitely one to watch.",Rocky Balboa
545,ladyjackhammer,back to the old Rocky......,10,28 December 2006,"I loved this movie. It was sad in parts and very realistic. It had some very funny lines and it was just great to get back to the beginning of where Rocky started and come full circle. It was very cool how Sly Stallone added in everything to complete the movie(such as ""little Marie"" and showing faint old clips from the past.) It ended on a good note and was a great movie all together. Rocky 5 wasn't the way to end the whole set of movies, it just wasn't the way to go. this movie was the better choice and had a very great fight in the end, this is who rocky is. Sly Stallone is Rocky. I also enjoyed his relationship with Paulie. They always butted heads but in the end they were family and loved each other. I also enjoyed his interaction with Steps, he was hanging out with him like he wanted to with his own son. Finally when Robert came around it was like the old days when Rocky loved to impress his son, and his son was proud of it.",Rocky Balboa
546,sentro1,"Rocky, better than expected....",7,31 December 2006,"Rocky was able to make the sequel with a realistic outcome. My initial thoughts were, jeez this guy is going to be out of shape and somehow whip his competition out of the ring and this sequel will be horrible. It took a different perspective, delving into the character's feelings and emotions throughout his trivial times in the past episodes. Then he took action, acknowledging that he is not in his prime but can still do something. As a true man would do, he has learned from his past and has developed a new perspective for the current times of his life. I would recommend this movie if you have been wondering, how has Rocky been doing all of these years. He will certainly let you know.",Rocky Balboa
547,marcusfranke,This seems to me like a tribute to the First - Original - and outstanding Best,7,31 March 2009,"Rocky Balbao has more than one little Moment, that reminds you of the First one. Spider Rico, Marie, not winning, but not giving up either. It's OK Adrian is dead, this is one step more on the emotional journey of the Character of Rocky, which never was made such good since the Original. The First is the best, there is absolutely no question, but Rocky Balbao is a worthy End and reminded how good Rocky really is and that he can reveal Inspiration on more than one level. After a mess like Rocky V (now forgotten) Rocky can retire without any regrets. This is an emotional good bye to a sportsman with the biggest heart and the strongest will, who i seem to know my whole life. Your fans will miss you.",Rocky Balboa
548,jacksilverz09,The Lion Heart is Back!!,8,29 March 2010,"Perfect sequel with the perfect climax continuing Rocky's legacy to the 21st century. Kudos to Stallone. To give this kind of a performance at his current age portraying a boxer shows how much the man is determined to pass to on the message that ""it ain't over till it's over!!"" I believe the 6th Rocky movie brings out the fighting spirit in Rocky the best. The other veterans have reprised their roles just as well. And I think, Rocky's son backing his father in the ring gives that extra feeling of respect for the Rocky character. This is the same Rocky we saw in 70s and 80s but this time he has seen it all, has a ton of life experience but somehow decides he has still more to see, still more to challenge, still more fight left in him, still has the lion in him to go the distance once again.Another all time gem in sports movies by Stallone and company centered on pure and never say die human spirit.",Rocky Balboa
549,PaulWFranklin,TKO,3,22 October 2021,"The film itself is weak.But what's most noticeable is the terrible cinematography. It's absolutely horrendous. It looks AWFUL. Like someone shot it on an old pocket camera with some poor lighting. Like an over-exposed social media video, it's just awful. Terrible.Just do yourself a favour and watch Raging Bull instead.",Rocky Balboa
550,Glengarry76,Er..am I missing something?,3,29 January 2007,"Caught this over the weekend and must confess to feeling disappointed and slightly perplexed. I am by no means anything other than a big Rocky fan ( with the exception of 5 of course ) and I love the resounding theme of a guy drawing on inner reserves of strength to overcome these superhuman almost insurmountable challenges to the backdrop of some of the best training tracks and montages to ever grace the screen.This, to me at least, had none of those components that made my pulse race and make me genuinely think about taking up boxing for the 150th time... Instead it smacked of a pure vanity project for Stallone who although in undoubtedly great shape for a guy of 60 is starting to bear an uncanny resemblance to his mother.The script was shockingly bad, the delivery of some of the lines worse. The sub text of Rocky Junior having strained relations with his father was woefully unexplored and as to the whole character / relationship development of L'il Marie and her son it was just plain odd. I guess Mason Dixon's character was credible but he had none of the charisma nor malevolence of previous foes like Clubber or Drago.Add to this a very sketchy training sequence with a falsetto trumpet ruining the ""Getting Stronger"" theme and a poor climactic fight and we have a film that in my opinion doesn't close the Rocky chapter satisfactorily at all.Sorry Sly - way off the mark for me and based on this I am certainly not holding out much hope for the next Rambo instalment.",Rocky Balboa
551,av6637,A worthy final chapter,10,21 December 2006,"I have been a fan of the Rocky series ever since my father introduced me to them. There are so many life lessons in these movies and they are far more reaching than just boxing.This final chapter, ""Rocky Balboa"", was an appropriate and fitting way to end Sylvester Stallone's life-long legacy of Rocky. Sylvester Stallone is an actor unlike no other. There were parts of this movie where I was in tears and there were parts where I was jumping out of my seat saying, ""Get him Rocky!"" I have seen so many sequels and trilogies that I have become very doubtful to any movie that is a part 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. This movie proves that you can come up with a great character that can speak to any age and make a movie that is just as good, if not better than the first.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",Rocky Balboa
552,thevoyces,Knockout Punch,10,6 January 2007,"One of my very favorite movie memories is this: I am eight years old, sitting in the theater with my cousin completely captivated by ""Rocky II."" We saw it in the theater about four or five times, returning home each time to discuss, recite lines, and fake-box each other until our parents yelled at us to finally knock it off. I went to see Rocky III on opening day, was similarly thrilled, and basically acted out in the same way ~ only it was all about 'The Eye Of The Tiger.' I saw the film in the theater about ten times. I saw Rocky IV once ~ it was okay. I never even bothered seeing Rocky V. But I've re-watched the first three on video and DVD over and over, as they are all just part of my very makeup now.When I saw the poster for ""Rocky Balboa,"" I got excited. It reminded me of the poster I would stare at for ""Rocky II."" Same font; same feel. But I was nervous about seeing it. Would it be lame?REVIEW: I just saw it for the second time last night, and I am going back again tomorrow. I have to say, I haven't wanted to return to see a movie in a theater since, well, since ""Rocky III."" ""Rocky Balboa"" is amazing and here is why: that feeling that I get when watching the first two, that feeling that I am holding back tears almost from the opening credits, just waiting for that moment in the film where I can just finally let it all out, returns in ""Rocky Balboa."" Why? Well, first and foremost, I think because its subject matter, not unlike the first two films, has little to do with BOXING and everything to do with LIFE ITSELF ~ the human spirit; the soul. It is written and acted beautifully. The plot is realistic. It is a strange thing that, upon leaving the theater, I had the thought that I just saw a movie that was ""too good"" to be in the theater; it is so inspiring, so pure ~ I feel I hardly deserved the right to see it. But this is just a personal thought that is neither here nor there. I guess I do deserve it, because there it is. I told everyone I know to go see it. And, like I said, I'm going to see it again tomorrow night. In short, it feels like the first movie anyone has made for me in decades. Thanks, Sly. If I lived near my cousin, I'd fake-box him into the ground before sitting down for a recap and a dinner.",Rocky Balboa
553,Baan,Rocky Begins,8,27 January 2007,"The movie begins showing Rocky's life after his boxing carrier. Director Stallone manages to pull off a rather slow drama, without the movie getting cheesy or boring. The interesting thing is that most of the character are pretty normal, and most of the situations displayed are not overly dramatic, yet the movie remains watchable. After tying the ends of Rocky's life we're quickly transported to the expected match between Rocky and Dixon, where no time is wasted on trivial details.In general this movie has most of the stuff that made the first (and partially second) movie as good as it actually is, a display of Rocky's everyday life and as a second part Rocky fighting for his boxing dream. All this is also seen in this new movie, but cleverly converted to the new situation that Rocky is in, thus the transition never feels repetitive or unimaginable.Of course there are some obvious illogical things in this movie, like for example how such an old boxer even can think of going into the ring with a champion, or why not mention how the brain damage that was discussed in rocky 5 suddenly has disappeared. None of this actually matters if you don't take the movie too seriously.8/10 for bringing Rocky back to life.",Rocky Balboa
554,rockadoo22,I loved it!,10,17 January 2007,"I was hesitant to see Rocky Balboa as I thought it was an absurd premise,a fighter nearing 60 years old getting in the ring with a young champion However,after viewing the film,I think it is on par with the original.The performances were heartfelt,especially by Stallone and Geraldine Hughes as the little girl who dissed him in the original Rocky.The use of flashbacks,although I am not a big fan of them,was so tastefully done.If you remember how the original ""Rocky"" made you feel,you will be delightfully surprised with this film.If you want to see a good film,especially one the whole family can watch,go see Rocky Balboa.You won't be disappointed!",Rocky Balboa
555,lukusbennettus,Should've thrown in the towel long ago,5,25 February 2007,"I saw this last week and was horribly disappointed. What a pointless film. I came away with the feeling that they shouldn't have bothered. I'm a fan of the originals, apart from 5, for various reasons, but this was probably on a par with number 5. That's how little I thought of it.It just retreads the same old stuff that has already been covered in each of the other films, but wait for it, this time he's older, a little lonely and obsessed with his dead wife. Great.All other characters were completely underdeveloped. The son of his new lady friend in particular may as well not have been in the film for all that his part contributed.His opponent had all the charisma of Wayne Rooney, but none of the thuggery. I didn't like him or dislike him. That was the problem. With the other films the opponents each had a thing. Carl Weather's character was a cocky, flamboyant, fast talking showman, like-able and tough looking. Mr T's character a bad-ass lunatic, and Dolph's a pumped up experimental Soviet giant. To the detriment of this film there's no easily identifiable attributes that Rocky's opponent possesses. He was boring, like the rest of the movie.As for the fight itself, there was absolutely no sense of achievement whatsoever upon Rocky's split decision loss. They made it pretty clear early on that his opponent wasn't taking it seriously, hadn't trained and that he bust his hand up in the first couple of rounds. Woo bloody hoo. The much talked up realistic physical action was pretty poor too. For the love of God learn how to block Rocky! The build up to the fight also lacked any real sense of anticipation, excitement or decent pacing.Anyway I must stop ranting, this wasn't meant to go on so long. Much like the Rocky series.",Rocky Balboa
556,r287,Best film of the year!,10,19 January 2007,This has got to be one of the best movies of the year! It really has a lot of heart and emotion as well as some scenes that will pump you up! Sly Stallone has really given the character a great send-off and I think this great American tradition that is the Rocky saga lives up to its pedigree. It is really up there with the original as well as including elements from some of the sequels. Although Rocky V was watchable it did miss the mark somewhat and this instalment really rectifies the situation and I'm sure the messages will ring true and inspire millions of people worldwide for generations to come.Most reassuringly we have a great soundtrack! Keep Punching!,Rocky Balboa
557,jrcook,Don't miss this one,9,21 December 2006,"I was not expecting ""Rocky Balboa"" to be as good as it was, I'm glad I was wrong. After the original ""Rocky"" movie, this would finish a close #2. This movie really reminded me of the original. ""Rocky Balboa"" is not an action/fight movie, so if you're looking for a lot of action, you won't get it until the fight at the end. This is a great Sports Drama film. This movie devotes a good amount of time to character development and gets this by looking into Rocky's past and to what matters most to him. If this is the last of the Rocky movies, this is a great way to go out. This is a must see movie for Rocky fans. If you have never seen a Rocky movie, I would not recommend this one as being your first. You really need to watch the other movies so you know the history going into this one. Overall, this is a great movie that I will definitely watch again.",Rocky Balboa
558,julio_v27612,Definitely worth it!,9,31 December 2006,"I was prepared to hate this film. I mean, how many times could Rocky get beat? Of course, curiosity got to me so I went to see it and was pleasantly surprised. The film was great! It spoke to me like nothing has in the recent past.This movie is more of a man coming to completeness than it is about boxing. It shows, in very clear terms, what a man should really be and how he should deal with the world around him. It's really the appropriate homage to end this franchise. I can imagine that there will be dozens of motivational speakers who will use this film when they speak.The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is it does get a little sappy. :D************ WARNING SPOILER!!! ****************** This is the way Rocky should go out, beaten but not defeated. A wave of his hand, a smile to those fans, and a kiss to his dead wife, the proud man feels complete and moves forward.",Rocky Balboa
559,toyguy01,Night at The Museum was better,1,19 January 2007,And apparently I am not the only person to think so. Rocky stalled out at 60 million while Night is closing in on 200 million and is still one of the top two movies out there. Dang!!! Sly just got whipped by three ancient janitors and the Frat Pack!!! It is a long fall for an Oscar winner like Stallone when Mickey Rooney can beat you well into his 80s. One thing for sly though. He can still be doing Rocky when he is 85 too. It will be just as believable as it is now. Can't wait for the Night At The Museum DVD. Ihope they pack it with lots of extras. As for Rocky? There is a guy at the local flea market that sells DVD rips for 3 bucks a piece. It might be worth that much anyway.,Rocky Balboa
560,artylrobb,"You can lick your wounds or paint with the blood. Brilliant, encouraging film",10,3 June 2007,"Regardless of whether you have appreciated the series, Sylvester's acting skills or boxing movies generally, this film is very special. Yes, seeing the first Rocky film is beneficial, but no. 6 stands in a class of its own quality-wise.Sylvester Stallone has this in common with Rocky; he will take a great deal on the chin to get where he wants to go and this time it really paid off. Why? Because it is so down to earth, relevant and encouraging. It deals with breakdowns in family relationships, expectations we may or may not have of friendships, loss, hurt, life's unfairness but most of all, the benefits of a positive attitude despite adversity. Probably the most memorable quote in the film is ""It ain't how hard you hit, it's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward..."" It has left an imprint on my life because it is so relevant to everyone's life. Lick your wounds or paint with the blood. (That was mine:) Acting-wise, Stallone really comes into his own when dealing with things, which are on his heart. I think the whole cast does well, but I want in particular to point out that Sly cannot be criticised here. It is so convincing that it is hard to distinguish between real-life and story as he is so passionate about what he wants to say but don't worry - it doesn't get preachy.Story-line: I went to see the film not having followed the series and not really knowing what to expect and after seeing it, I wasn't sure I understood it, but one thing I did know, was that I wanted to see it again. Second time and after having seen Rocky 1, I understood the significance of so much dialogue and so little action and it has become one of my favourite films to watch again. This is an intricately woven story that cannot fail to impress.There is something larger than life about this film and I think you should see it, and if you have, I think you should see it again:)",Rocky Balboa
561,ntomchesin,The perfect ending after 30 years,9,26 December 2006,"It is now three years after Rocky's wife has passed on. Rocky owns a restaruant in Philly, sees very little of his son, and takes the death of his wife hard. The current heavy weight champion Mason Dixon, is not liked by the fans, and is boo'd when he wins a fight because he has no heart, and he is not challenged. One night ESPN does a simulation fight by computer of what would happen if Rocky (from 1976) and Mason (in his prime) could fight and duke it out. The computer sees Rocky as the champion, which only infuriates Mason. Long story short, Rocky still feels he has enough left for one round. The boxing commission in Philly denies his request for a license, but is able to obtain one in Las Vegas, where the fight is held. We see Rocky train with Duke, his son, new found friends and uncle Pauly, just like in other Rocky movies, and it brings back memories. Rocky and Mason duke it out, and the fight scenes are wonderful, but not like the first or second Rocky where you jump out of your seats.This movie is written by Sylvester, who touches on real events that people deal with everyday, events we can all relate to in some form. Rocky struggles just like we struggle, which is how it all started out in the original Rocky.A must see!!! 9/10",Rocky Balboa
562,kikioreekee-1,Dignified and Satisfying End for Rocky Fans (Spoilers),10,23 December 2006,"I am a 40-year-old rabid Rocky fan. I saw all the films in the movie theater and have thought of Rocky as my hero for a long time. As a kid, Rocky represented overcoming the naysayers and doing what you want and becoming a winner. This message continued through all the Rockys except Five, which left us fans sad and disheartened that our beloved Rock was on the outs. I am glad Stallone waited so long for this film, it has made it all the sweeter.I have admired Sylvester Stallone for many of the same reasons I do Rocky and although he has made some questionable choices with some films, I find him fascinating. How he is as a person or an employer is not in question- as a writer and director, and as the creater of Rocky, he is amazingly talented. Rocky is an American icon and this film solidifies that fact. This film was made so Stallone could end the series with a high note, make up for the disappointment the fans felt for Five, and leave Rocky on top. This film does that and more.Altogether I think fans will be pleased to see Rocky is thriving. He has his restaurant, he has a home, he has his turtles back (YES!) and seems comfortable in his own skin. The scenes at the outdoor market were heartwarming and made me happy that Rocky has finally found his place in life after boxing. The scenes dealing with Adrian's death were mercilessly tragic. Again, an excellent choice to have her pass. The son was solid, not really feeling his place in the world with his dad being so famous and well known. And Paulie- ever-present, bitter, killer one-liner Paulie. I hand it to Stallone for bringing so much of the past for us fans. Spider Rico and the original boxing commissioner were back, as well as Little Marie. There were references to many things that happened in the past in the script that made me believe Stallone respected us fans enough to know we'd recognize that. I found only two shortcomings, which was the training scenes were too short and the fight was edited too close. As a fan, I needed more long shots to really see the action. I enjoyed the flashbacks during the fight scene, though. For anyone who says the fight was ""unrealistic"", lets please remember-it was supposed to be exhibition and then turned into something else when the champ realized Rocky could still dole it out. The fact that it was a draw instead of a win was good. In fact, Rocky could have technically LOST and it wouldn't have made a difference. Rocky won in all of our hearts.Thanks to Stallone for this film. It is a gift!",Rocky Balboa
563,PorkChopExpress70,I hate to say it but I liked it,8,5 January 2007,"I hate to say it but I liked ""Rocky Balboa"": I think that it could not be done better. Sylvester Stallone has succeeded in an event more difficult than to become the new champion of the world of the heavy weights: he has succeeded to involve the spectator. Plot is simple but it works. Some quotes are weak but some are really memorable: Dixon: ""WHERE IS THAT FROM,THE 80'S?"" Rocky: ""THAT'S PROBABLY THE 70'S."". There are a lot of good ideas and good acting (Burt Young is great). The match that concludes the film has a new television style and an intelligent ending result. After Rocky V finally a perfect ending to the saga. OK Sly, you did it but stop you now",Rocky Balboa
564,KarthikStallone,It Ain't over till its Over,10,16 January 2007,This is a perfect ending to Rocky's career.Winning is not only winning the fights but also winning the hearts of the people. Rocky showed a lot of heart even outside the ring. Over the years he has matured and now giving that legacy to the younger generation. This movie is very meaningful and artistic. This movie brings everything in place.If you haven't watched rocky 1 to 5 then its highly recommended not to watch this movie because you wont understand the True Rocky. I am planning to watch this movie more than 100 times. A true Rocky fan will enjoy this movie. It has sentiments and the movie is shot with so much of logic in it. He has gone into the depth of the human nature and psychology before writing and directing this movie. ROCKY IS THE MAN.,Rocky Balboa

He did it because he knew it wasn't over, because he felt he had something to prove. Because he wanted Rocky's curtain falls to be as true as his birth had been. We welcomed it as it deserved to be welcomed, with applause, with tears. This is what he wanted, and this is what we wanted. But the only thing I can regret now, is that it's truly over. Whatever people say, or may have said in the past, I think I'll always consider the Rocky Movies as a major achievement in the History of Cinema. First because it arrived at a time where people needed to believe in their dreams, and because it gave to a wonderful person, his revenge on life. Now wiser, stronger... He gave us the opportunity to read his mind again, to share his fears and aspirations, to share a real piece of life, sweat, blood and tears. This is what is Rocky to me, what is Sly. True, complex, and beautiful.",Rocky Balboa
566,mactionY2K5,An Emotional and Heart-warming End to the Rocky Saga,8,20 December 2006,"Let me start off by saying this movie was not what I expected. I walked in, thinking we could be in for another helping of the garbage we have been served 4 times since the original came out in 1976. With my expectations low, I came out feeling good about what I just saw.Rocky Balboa does something for the audience for the first time since the original: delivered a knockout blow of heart and emotion. I am ashamed to admit I found myself holding back tears during several points of the movie, from beginning all the way to the final credits.As everyone already knows, its the story of an aged legend, out to prove to himself one last time that he still has the fire inside of him to compete in the ring with the best. Along the way, however, the audience gets drawn into the emotion of the movie, as the aged southpaw mourns the loss of his late wife, Adrian. Throw in his son, Robert, who has made it clear to his father that he is tired of being in his shadow. You even have the opportunity to show sympathy for Paulie, the one character you never got tired of from the beginning of this franchise to the very end, played by Burt Young to perfection.The final bout was also one of the better we have seen in the franchises 6 films. I won't give anything away, but the way it was presented gave it a more realistic feel that any boxing fan has grown used to. Antonio Tarver, who plays Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, may not be one of the most hated opponents in the franchise, but definitely believable and well deserving of some recognition in this film.In the end, this will go down as one of the better films in the franchise. If you have negative expectations going in, I recommend you give it a chance. You might just come out of the theater chanting the name ""Rocky"" one more time...",Rocky Balboa

I was thinking Rocky was gonna come out in depends but he came out with the ""lighting and thunder"" once described by Micky in the previous movies. The fight was well choreographed and i enjoyed the flashback scenes. Way to end the year @ the box office.

First saw the trailer at the Casino Royale opening and was so inspired I wished it was playing then. The reviews on Rocky seemed to reflect the age of the reviewer; those old enough to have seen the original when it opened were ready for this movie and rated it highly. Younger reviewers could only remember Rocky III/IV/V and were not as excited with this addition. As for my review, the fact that Stallone had $100 in his pocket when he tried to present the first Rocky script, refused $350,000 to sell the script and walk away, and instead, demanded to star in the movie, gives him a free ride for life. The new movie, Rocky Balboa, ranks right up there with the original. Winners include Sly himself, his son, Marie and the Champ; great jobs by all. Don't miss this movie.",Rocky Balboa

You do NOT have to be a Rocky fan to enjoy this movie. You don't need to have seen any of the previous 5 films to enjoy it.Sly said he made this film for the baby boomers and that's pretty obvious throughout the movie. However, most people can relate to this movie and almost everyone will enjoy it.I won't give too many details, but I will tell you that the movie starts out a little slow with some retrospect (but not flashbacks, so forget about anything like that).The movie really shows how so many things change over the years, but some things never change, like heart and human spirit.The movie of course centers around Rocky Balboa, but it is not about his fighting. It is about issues he is having at his age. His wife, Paulie, his son, just about everything and he takes it all in as life gives him just about all he can take. His wanting to get back to fight is quite metaphoric, but Rocky really delivers some strong lines and acting, as does the rest of the cast.For those who enjoy the old-fashioned Rocky fighting, you won't be let down either.Bottom line, this is a good film in and of itself and a great film for the Rocky franchise. Highly recommended.",Rocky Balboa
571,night_silviu,A great movie by all means,10,29 December 2006,"I saw Rocky I,II,II,IV and V when i was no more than 10 years old. It impressed me very much, especially the first one. In this summer i managed to get the entire series and i realized i made one of the best deals of my life. These movies are like solid gold. The send a clear message to everyone's heart. They tell a story of a good man, a role-model, someone to look-up to. Rocky may not be a smart or wise character, but he sure has something to say that could later come as an inspiration to anyone that watches the series without skepticism. I waited a lot for Rocky VI(Rocky Balboa) to appear and i must say that the waiting has payed of. It is a great movie and i hope it will get many awards. All i can say is : Bravo, Sylvester Stallone. Good job!Go to the cinema, buy the DVD or whatever.. just watch it! You will not be disappointed.",Rocky Balboa
572,paul-bevan,not the same without Adrianna,7,6 January 2007,"This is an okay film but it suffers from two main things. Firstly, the guy who plays Rocky's son in this film is a very weak actor. There simply wasn't any depth to his performance at all. It was terrible actually, he was wooden. The worst thing you can do in a followup film is to change actors for the same part. I know it was not possible for his real son to reprise his role but for me it didn't work and ruined the film.Secondly, a Rocky film without Adrian just isn't the same. This simply did not feel like a Rocky film to me. Even Sly didn't seem to play the part the way he usually does. Burt Young wasn't in the film much, although he did his best with what he was given.I thought the end scene was rushed....Adrians death didn't really carry as much emotion as it should as we are transported to a time when she is already dead. I thought she could have been in the film briefly for the first half.I hope this film does well at the box office because i think Stallone is a terrific actor and person in general, but this film could have been so much more.",Rocky Balboa
573,LoganJSmith,Too much,7,24 December 2006,"Overall it was pretty good, but it just wasn't believable at all... well, not that fighting a Russian Superman to avenge your friend's death slash score a victory in the Cold War was... And not like street fighting a kid named Tommy Gunn was... and not like losing to Mr. T and then training to beat him again was... But there were WAY too many impassioned monologues for one movie. I'm pretty sure every main character got at least one, and Rocky had 3 or 4 I think. The fight (yeah there was basically only just one) was pretty good, but I felt there could have been a lot more there. Good enough to see once, but no more, and definitely not worth buying the DVD.",Rocky Balboa
574,texuspete,Goosebumps!!!,9,15 January 2007,"It was Christmas Eve when I was handed the 7 inch shiny beautiful disk. A real gem. A REAL Christmas treasure. Wow. I stood there. Shaking. Knowing that I was one of the lucky few who was going to see Rocky Balboa in its entirety way before the UK premiere. I couldn't wait for the next morning to arrive. And it wasn't to see if Father Christmas had been. He already had.From the moment I pressed play I was transported back in time. 15 years in fact to 1991. The year the last (and worst) Rocky movie came out. Talk about nostalgia. And the goosebumps. Whoa. ""Take me back, do do do doooo, take me back......."" That's the first words in the film from the new film score. And take you back it does.The film is gritty and much more true to the original than the later instalments. This is a proper, gritty movie. With a great story. It begins with Rocky checking out his old haunts and reminiscing about his late wife Adrian. As ever with Rocky films, there wont be a dry eye in the house! Paulie is here. As good as he ever was. We also find out more about Spider Rico who Rocky fought in his early days. He has a minor role in the film. But the other 'lead' character is a girl that Rocky told off in the original film. Telling her to go home and be careful not to become a 'Crack Whore'. To which she replied ""Screw you Creepo!"". Remember her? Well she's all grown up and unlike Adrian, encourages Rocky to fight.Anyway, Rocky decides to fight again. He's got all kinds of demons still and needs to get them out. He wants nothing more than a few local bouts, but after a ""computer fight"" gets people talking, he's talked into an exhibition bout with the current Heavyweight Chanpion of the World, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon.Watch out for the AWESOME Balboa speeches. Notably to the boxing board and also to his son. And the best bit of the film, when his trainer delivers those rousing words made so famous by the trailer, ""Let's start building, some hurtin' bombs"".The fight scenes are great. Stallone looks fantastic. The story is brilliant. This is a great movie! Does Rocky win, loose, draw or die?! You'll have to watch it to find out! 9/10 Chris GrovesIf you like my review, be one of my friends on myspace at www.myspace.com/texuspete",Rocky Balboa
575,wyckeddreamz,simply put,10,21 December 2006,"This film is Rocky's knockout punch.... from start to finish, this film was every minute better than I could have ever hoped for. It had the drama, the heart, the action, and the humor that Rocky films had become famous for. Then there was the training montage, no rocky film is complete without it, and good old Sly didn't let us down there either. I absolutely loved it, and am going to see it again tonight with 4 of my friends. Tarver was surprisingly spot on in his role in the movie, he didn't have the usual ""athelete acting"" you see so often. My hat is off to him also on a job well done.And no Rocky film is complete without Paulie and his tough as nails sour outlook on life....he delivered the goods too.Do yourself a favor, go see it.",Rocky Balboa
576,SoSTL,Rocky Balboa is a must-see!,10,20 December 2006,"Hey all who read this, I just saw Rocky with two of my friends and it was the correct ending to a movie with such a long history. This film was so great it completely demolishing the image of Rocky V which a fair but not so great movie. I loved this film, it took you back to the days of the original the way it was written. It was about more than a man trying to have one more fight, it was about a man who was fighting himself. I loved the way this film payed homage to the original. If you are a Rocky fan you should really see it because it is well worth the money. Even if you are not a Rocky fan, it's a great movie that does for anyone what the first one did. It makes you believe in the underdog. The only sad part is that the greatest underdog story ever written truly does come to an end in this film. You'll understand once you see the movie. I am such a huge Rocky fan, once it was over I didn't even want to leave the theater (and I wasn't alone). This film was the picture perfect ending to an era. Sylvester Stallone gets kudos from me because it was a well written film, and Sly directed it phenomenally. What was the most inspiring was the fact that everyone in the movie theater clapped when the training started and cheered when the movie ended, and no one I mean no one left until the lights came on and they knew the film was over. If nothing else, his acting was superb and he gave some very inspiring speeches that'll move anyone whose ever been through some hard times. I love Sly and I want to thank him for making this movie, it erases the fifth one out of your mind and it gives you a look at Sly's acting ability and shows why he was and still is a great actor. In closing go see the movie, I promise you won't be disappointed. Kara",Rocky Balboa
577,bogdan-al-geana,Stallone at his best as a director!,8,7 January 2007,"I have seen the all 5 Rocky movies, from III starting to get bored because of the recipe. The latest, ""Rocky Balboa"" is by far a nice study on Philadelphia night feelings and regrets. Such a pity this movie had to explode and to fulfill the spaces of a not important boxing match, Stallone could have go on with his study without any explanations. Not wanting to praise too much Stallone as a director and script writter, it's impossible not to notice an European direction towards analysis and human feellings. Balboa is a good friend and sportsman. He is the leader of the pack, and not a VIP. He is not a lover, and no trace of Rambo, thanks God.I hope there will not be a Rocky Balboa II, but I strongly wish Stallone could film a sequel, on his son and on his nowadays problems, just a simple European movie. It would be fabulous. Stallone is now a mature director and the best is yet to come.",Rocky Balboa
578,GaryVidmar,Stallone's best sucker play yet....,1,14 December 2006,"With all the other reviewers detailing the picture's schematic, I'll just say you'll be hard pressed to find a more unnecessary piece of sentimental trash than this movie. Here's a film as messed up as the current state of the sport it personifies - and for those looking to re-capture the spirit of the first - well, that product-of-its-time has seen it's day, as has Stallone. There are a couple of Stallone speeches here that will induce vomiting. ROCKY is a role model for losers - it's constant attempts to reincarnate the character is proof enough beyond any detailed opinion I can offer. Those paying for this will get exactly what they deserve - but I'm doubtless Stallone is going to find milking this cash cow once again is as futile as him regaining his youth. A piece of advice: watch RAGING BULL - a masterpiece that gets better with time and has more honest emotion in a single minute than all the ROCKY films put together!",Rocky Balboa
579,mallrats69420,Why do people like this movie?,2,24 January 2007,"This movie was weak. Good reviews prompted me to go and see a sub-par movie that was poorly written. I believe that Stallone was trying to cash in by making a half-assed movie.The dialog throughout the film is terrible. It is almost painful to hear Stallone deliver his speeches throughout the film. This movie goes through lame, lagging character development to build up to a fight that lacks almost everything.I was most disappointed by the lack of montage. There was one training montage before the fight and it was bogus. Past Rocky films have followed a formula that barely works, this one was made in its own horrible way.",Rocky Balboa
580,Jim-223,Heart warming,10,21 December 2006,"I know I'm giving Rocky a high score / rating, but I guess it's because I've been waiting a long time for a movie with real feeling. It's a trip down memory lane for all of the Rocky fans out there. There are a lot of moments of sadness and longing, but that's what makes it ""real"". Most of us spend most of our time struggling and fighting to get ahead and make a difference. When we get to the end of the line we want to be able to look back and feel like we accomplished something and that the journey was worth it. Rocky does this in fine fashion. You will find yourself wanting to cheer his name as you watch him try to beat the odds one last time.",Rocky Balboa
581,Coyote23,Could Be The Best Rocky Yet.,9,27 December 2006,"Okay, it may not beat out the first Rocky, but it definitely comes close. In fact, the two films could be bookmarks to one another - they're certainly the only two films in the series that should ever be taken seriously. Compare the training montage in the first film to the training montage in this one: in the first, you see a young, tough underdog, preparing for his first major fight and the one that will make his career. Here, you see an almost identical montage, only Rocky is older, much older, preparing for his comeback fight, and the context has changed: he's older, he may be past his prime, but he's still tough. The question of ""Is he good enough to win the fight?"" is present like it hasn't been since the first film, but it means something different here.Sly's direction is solid, probably better than any of the past Rocky films he's helmed: contemporary, self-aware, genuine and totally down to earth. The relationship between Rocky and his son (Milo Ventimiglia) is well-handled, although the inclusion of a surrogate son seems out of place and unnecessary at times. And the final fight lives up to the best of the fight climaxes of past Rocky films. Everyone on-screen makes the best out of what could have been a weak script, and while it never blows the audience out of the water, it is what Rocky is: solid.Solid, solid, solid. That's the one word that characterises this film more than anything. Nobody drops the ball, in what could easily have been an embarrassment to everyone involved. More than that, ""Rocky Balboa"" makes you forget the multiple low points of the franchise over the last couple of decades. Forget everything in between: if you're interested in Rocky and have never seen any of the movies, you owe it to yourself to watch ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky Balboa"" back to back.",Rocky Balboa
582,vixwatts,Surprisingly good.,10,29 December 2006,"OK - so the 10 rating is a bit of an exaggeration, but I really want people to see this movie. I went with a friend as a joke, expecting to giggle and mock throughout, but we were both stunned to silence in the first ten minutes. It's really good. The script is tight, the characterization is plausible, it's beautifully shot, and really quite moving. It's a shame it has to end in the big fight, but even that is handled pretty well. Dixon's broken hand and lack of pre-fight training makes it slightly less incredible that Balboa doesn't get totally mashed, and all in all I think Stallone deserves some credit for making an honest film with a stack of integrity.",Rocky Balboa
583,henryv-2,Re: A True Crowd Pleaser!,8,12 December 2006,"I don't really go on message boards but I just came back from a screening of the film and let me tell you that ""Rocky Balboa"" kicks ass!! It's just the type of positive movie the public needs right now. Stallone strips back all of Rocky's character and takes us back to the grassroots character he created in the first film. The story is very creative and Stallone really digs deep to create a well rounded character facing many dilemmas in life. The rest of the cast is great as well. This is a true crowd pleaser for all ages and a great film to see with the family during the holiday time. Its positive message of ""Never give up"" and that ""you are never too old to achieve your dreams"" will resonate with you long after you leave the theater. Stallone spoke after the movie and the first thing he said was how disappointed he was with ""Rocky V"" and that it hit him really hard at how bad it turned out. Thats why it took 16 years to bring Rocky back to the screen.I don't want to give anything more away but I will tell you that during and after the film, the crowd was cheering! A perfect way for the ""Rocky""saga to come to an end. Way to go Sly!!",Rocky Balboa
584,ProfessorGriff,Rocky Balboa is a Knockout,10,23 December 2006,"Before this movie was released a lot of people were skeptical and people often went as far as to make fun of this film because of the terrible fifth installment of the series. Rocky Balboa is however what this series needed as an amazing and heartwarming finale to this series.Rocky Balboa is a film that takes place in the usual type of underdog setting and feel that the original films had. This movie which I managed to see opening day had the people in the audience pleased and even got a standing ovation.It was also extremely well edited with black and white flashback sequences and round transitions that were done in different almost ""Sin City"" like fashion. The movie also brought back characters Little Marie and Spider Rico from the first film. In all honesty I would say that this movie was probably just as good as the first and a perfect end to a great series of films.",Rocky Balboa
585,mrstefanprice,Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!,10,21 January 2007,"As A massive fan of Rocky (and by that I mean I used to pull my eyes down everyday to train them to look like Rocky, I used to wear clothes like he wears in Rocky 5, shape my eyebrows to look more like him and do the mannerisms.) I have been very affected by his journey, its his ""heart and fire"" that really gets me and I cry and shiver Every time, like in Rocky 3 where he shouts ""I'm afraid"" on the beach. Rocky Balboa is a VERY VERY fitting end to his journey as a fighter. Its not about physical victory but emotional ones, and I thought it was fantastic.The fight scenes are VERY realistic, there were not in the other films but they suited the melodrama of the 80's ear. This is more like the fights in the contender where they are explosive and exciting but REAL.",Rocky Balboa
586,jssnw,What another great underdog story,9,27 December 2006,"This movie is great. It goes back to the roots of Philly where Rocky is from and brings back the classic style that we are use to. It is a GREAT way to make up for how terrible the fifth movie was... Rocky has quite a few monologues and they make him out to be smarter than what I remember him to be... however, that is all fine and dandy because this movie is great! Paulie is back in his old ways as well... he keeps it rough along the edges and still has his ""old school"" feel. The way they include as many actors from the past movies, such as spider the guy he fought in the first rocky... really shows how great of a final chapter this movie is on the rocky series. If you do not like to get pumped up watching rocky get the snot beat out of him and keep coming back for more, don't go watch this movie, but if you are the opposite of that, you MUST go see this flick!!!",Rocky Balboa
587,Bruski2006,I Don't Know What To Say!!!,10,21 December 2006,"Wow, I never thought I would get the chance to see a Rocky movie in theaters! The movie was more the I expected. It had the right amount of Rocky oriented humor, It had deep moments and of course one heck of an excellent fight. The average Rocky film was a little less than two hours, so, the times line up very well. Stallone was able to become Rocky Balboa with ease and did an excellent job. In my opinion, it made up for Rocky 5. As always, Rocky signified the true underdog, American spirit. Rocky has told to the world is that perseverance is everything. He is a true hero and a legend. No one will ever forget Rocky Balboa.Thanks, Sly, Bruce",Rocky Balboa
588,lovagirllucy1986,I liked the movie.,10,6 April 2007,"I really loved this movie & thought that it was the best out of all of the Rocky movies. I have seen all of the Rocky movies 1,2,3,4,5, & obviously this one. I thought that this was better because it focused more on his life than his career which I think made it better because the other one's did the opposite. Also, Stallone's body was in pretty good shape for a 60 year old man & it was even better than the other guy he had to fight against in the movie. Bringing the character Marie back was also cool because it was someone who wasn't a stranger to the movie that nobody had ever heard of, if that makes any sense.If you don't know who Marie is, she was the girl in the first Rocky movie in the beginning of the movie who Rocky walked home after seeing her hanging around some guys & smoking. I suggest that everybody should watch this movie if you're a Rocky fan & even if your not, you should watch it anyway. If you haven't seen the other Rocky movies it would probably be a good idea & a fun one to watch the other one's too.",Rocky Balboa
589,xxkimshixx,Disappointed,6,3 January 2007,"I was waiting for this movie to come for such a long time. Since the last Rocky was not that great, I wanted this last Rocky to be phenomenal! After watching this final make of Rocky, I was truly disappointed. First off, I felt like everything was cut short. The ending match between Mason and Balboa was...weak. It was way too short for a Rocky film and all the other parts didn't have enough leverage. Although it wasn't awful, it just didn't live up to the final Rocky. Of course all the past Rocky fans should go see the movie since it is the last of the saga, but I still feel like it didn't live up to its expectations.",Rocky Balboa
590,ThatCuteTravellerGuy,Such an inspiring movie for me personally,10,22 January 2020,"That inspirational monologue about it not being important how you get knocked down, but its how you get back up again that counts......

My heart has been bloody freezing recently, but I won't give up and hope one day I will see her (emoji) smile and she will get back in touch!My friend Viktoria also knows a lot about not giving up and being positive in her own life, which completely resonates with this movie's message.This movie has given me the inspiration to try and try again. Fingers crossed!",Rocky Balboa
591,blankout59,The idea for a great movie...,5,22 December 2006,"was there. I recently saw the movie, was excited to see the previews and could not wait. Well the movie starts. First, it was great to see Stallone and all the characters(sooo nostalgic).I like the first hour of the movie. It had good acting and so much emotion. Quality scenes! Now, the problem with the movie was the lack of build up. Getting the characters to properly meet Rocky. One issue was Spider Rico. He just pops up by eating at the restaurant. They should of had his character reintroduce himself in the movie...Just like Duke the trainer. He comes out of nowhere and starts saying his lines without an introduction. I mean it's been at least 16 years since the last Rocky! I think if they spent more time introducing the characters the movie would of been better. Let me give an example based on my idea: Duke is doing something(reading or watching TV) and Rocky stops by his house and talks to him about his dilemma. Rocky then persuades Duke to train him; that's what i'm talking about!! I feel the first hour of the movie was worked on with tender loving care. And the last 42 minutes were rushed to disaster. I truly love the Rocky series. I have all of the movies. I'm even going to buy the sixth movie just to have it.Now with the last minutes of the movie... What a let down. I hated to hear the Rocky theme modified from the original(sounded too new age). I know we are in modern times, but if it ain't broke don't fix it. His training scenes were OK, they should of trained at least 2 times within the movie like in part 4(with different music). The fight was just plain clumsy. I didn't get that emotional feeling like previous movies. I guess I was expecting the same style as of the older movies.The ending was the worse. Ending like a sequel was in the works. In my opinion it didn't feel like this was the last of the series.",Rocky Balboa
592,Jon Weedon,Why this was my favourite film of the year,10,31 December 2007,"When I first found out there was going to be a sixth Rocky film, like a lot of people, I cringed. How could the character possibly be resurrected, especially at this late stage, I wondered. I made a note to myself to avoid it like the plague.A review in the newspaper changed my mind however, and prompted me to go and see it the day it was released here in the UK, and (much to the amusement of the guy at the counter) I was back to see it 24 hours later and I've watched it countless times on DVD since. I like it that much, and here's why.The background is well explained in the first few scenes. Rocky is still living in Philadelphia, running a restaurant. His beloved Adrian died of cancer a few years back and poor Rocky misses her dreadfully. His son, Robert Jr, is trying to make his way in the commercial sector and resents the fact that people accept him for who his father is and not for himself. Paulie is still working at the meat factory and is, well, still Paulie.The heavyweight division is in a terrible state and the current champion, Mason Dixon, is unable to win the respect of the fans simply by dint of the fact that there isn't anyone out there who can give him a decent contest.Rocky is still living in the past and on the anniversary of Adrian's death visits some of his old haunts. In a bar he meets ""Little Marie"" who he tried to help in the first movie. He befriends Marie and also strikes up a relationship with her son, Steps, after they visit his restaurant in South Philly.The film has some nice humorous moments and the scene where Rocky wrongly assumes that Marie's son is his white friend is just one of them.While Robert Jr is drinking in a bar with his co-workers, a TV programme stages a computer fight between Rocky in his prime and Mason Dixon. The champ is outraged when he sees it as it will only reduce his popularity further and it is only a matter of time before Rocky see it himself. When he does, some old feelings return, and he comes to the conclusion that going back in the ring may be the only thing he can do to get rid of his grief and anger.Meanwhile, Dixon visits his old trainer and in an excellent scene, reminiscent of Rocky's relationship with Mickey, the wise old man tells him what he needs to do to earn the only respect that matters - self respect.Rocky gets himself a licence after a meeting with the boxing commission and only after he has made a powerful speech when his request is initially turned down. As soon as this becomes public knowledge, Mason Dixon's promoters visit him to set up a showdown with Dixon. True to form, the only interests this serves is not Rocky's or Dixon's, but their own.Before he starts training for the fight, Rocky has the most important showdown of the film, with his son Robert. Robert is dead set against the fight as it will only make it harder for him to step out of Rocky's shadow. Rocky gives another great speech, telling Robert that he has to be his own person, and not look for someone to blame when things aren't going well, and most importantly, ""it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward."" Robert takes the advice to heart and leaves his job. The scene where the two men meet in the cemetery the next day is one of the most touching in the film. Robert realises that it is time to figure out who he wants to be, but for now he just wants to help Pop train for the last fight of his life.The training montage is suitably brief as the film is more about characters than it is about boxing. It simply focuses on Rocky getting stronger, and meeting his own goals.The fight scene is much more realistic than most of the previous ones in the franchise, and the casting of real-life boxing champion Antonio Tarver proved inspired. Instead of Rocky taking a beating for 15 rounds or turning the fight around unexpectedly as in previous movies, there is an interesting twist early on which means Dixon is finally granted the ""baptism of fire"" that he has needed for so long - he just never expected it to be against an ageing ex-champion.The film ends beautifully, with Rocky visiting Adrian's grave one last time and saying goodbye to her. One hopes he will now be able to move on, and this is a poignant reminder that the whole franchise was, like all the best stories, ultimately just a love story.",Rocky Balboa

If i had to describe this film in one word it would be EMOTIONAL but as i have said i will let you find out why? If you want to see the film of the year then this is it and i would finally like to add for Stallone fans he is just as fit as ever - Stallone at his very best!!!",Rocky Balboa
599,smugwimp,I didn't think it was bad. But I could have waited for the video...,7,20 December 2006,"I liked it. I did.I don't recall much of the other rocky movies, other than I either liked them, or didn't.I liked One, Two & Three.The rest were lacking in both decent story and editing.This one brings back a bit of the emotion and personality that made you root for him in the first few. Stallone made a decent job out of making an elder Rocky believable, the supporting actors supported well, and the overall presentation was realistic enough to get lost a little.That being said, If you don't go to see movies much, and are looking for the ""One"" for your buck, unless you're a real Stallone fan, you can live until the DVD release.But Stallone fans will enjoy his acting, the story, and all of the things that helped make the ""Rocky"" machine what it is today.",Rocky Balboa
600,justiceryan,Best one since the original,10,25 October 2006,"Had the opportunity last night to see the World Premier of Rocky Balboa two months before it will be released. A great movie. I was impressed with it, in fact the storyline is something we will all appreciate. I am looking all over the internet right now to see if I can find the two speeches Rocky gives in the movie, that gave me chills. One was to the commission, when he tries to get his boxing license, and the other to his son. The acting is great, the storyline as stated before is great, the cast is well put together as well. This is Stallone's best acting ever. The only downfall, I thought was the soundtrack, as Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) entrance music to the fight is great, and of course the theme to Rocky is great, but other than that the soundtrack was not good at all. However as we all know we cannot judge a movie by its soundtrack. This is a must see!",Rocky Balboa
601,NickB911,Rocky Balboa was a hit!!,8,20 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa was a very good movie!! A fitting end to a long lasting franchise that got soft with the last picture. I liked the premise and the story, I liked how the film was nostalgic and also the drama of the story. Stallone did a very good job with this and I was pleased with the result. Any fan of the Rocky series would love this movie and any fan of just the first film will enjoy it as well. Good Stuff!! The best Rocky film since II in 1979. Stallone has his one liners as does Paulie, they jump right into character and the end fight sequence is filmed more realistically than the other films. The movie hits on many levels and has the underlying theme of ""putting your heart and soul into it"" and believing in yourself that the first two films had. All in all a feel good movie and a great way to spend a couple hours at the theater this holiday weekend. Rocky!! Rocky!! Rocky!!",Rocky Balboa
602,michael-r-kirkpatrick,"Rocky Balboa, a movie to remember",10,28 December 2006,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Now, I've heard many negative remarks about this film, but I've realized that most people bash before they've seen it. Rocky Balboa is a heartfelt film that is directed with care by the aging Stallone. Not only is Rocky Balboa a good end to the series, but it's also like Stallone is capping off his career. Him and this character have been through a lot, and he shows that with this film. The speeches are inspiring, the acting is pretty good, and the film itself is directed delicately by its lead actor. He knows this character and where he's been the last 16 years. Stallone is exceptionally great in this film because he's played the roll six times now, and slips back into the roll like he never left. This is a film that people need to see. Rocky part one and now part six are two films that tell the great American story. A down on is luck human being, whether he's a boxer or a car's salesman, Rocky is a man that you can route for. Sure he has his problems, but who doesn't. Rocky is that average guy that you see walking around, and your first instinct is that he looks like a bum, and perhaps he is, but Rocky shows that he has more character and respect than anyone. He's the lovable loser that you route for all the way to the end. The best thing about this movie is that the story itself is compelling. It follows the same pattern as the first one, and succeeds in it's goal to show how age is just a number, and that you should never count the underdog out because hes always got something left in him that will surprise you. While people may have their doubts, they should set them aside and go see what could very well be the most inspirational movie of the year, and one of the top five of the year as well. A great end to the series. People are too worried about this movie, that they forget Rambo IV will be out in 2008. Now that scares me.",Rocky Balboa
603,Belle892,Adrianne!!,10,25 December 2006,"First of all, if I could give this movie more than a ten, I would!! Rocky Balboa was By Far the Best Movie This Year. Coming from a highly social-able 14 year old who goes to the movies every weekend, thats pretty darn good. It inspired me to go home and watch all of the other Rocky's ((which I did in a marathon with my family today)) that I had never seen. My whole family has always been really into them, but I never had the patience to watch them. Last night my sister talked me into going to see this and it totally changed my opinion on everything. This is an awesome story of growing old and keeping your chin up--even when those around you try to drag you down. I give it twenty-five out of ten!!",Rocky Balboa
604,j_miller805,Really enjoyed this one!!,8,20 December 2006,"Just got back from seeing Rocky Balboa with my sons. My youngest is about the age I was when I saw Rocky in 1976. This movie had a lot of the same type of qualities that made me enjoy the first movie. It was respectful of all that had been done in previous movies and paid tribute in a way to Adrian as well. I am glad I saw it and thought it was a pretty great movie. I will probably see it again this weekend! The story line was very well written and I thought Stallone did a great job knowing what he might be up against making this film. I think it played well to all audience ages and it was nice to see a movie with my boys that was not only one of my favorite characters growing up, but one that my boys have grown to like as well.If I could have changed anything... I would have added another 10-15 minutes of actual fight scenes since it was his last movie and I really enjoy the way Stallone does his boxing scenes (Rocky III was my favorite). But as it was, there was PLENTY of good boxing scenes and I only hope I look as good as Stallone does now at 60!! So this movie is definitely worth seeing! As with most of his movies, I left the theatre smiling and feeling good! I recommend it!",Rocky Balboa

607,milorad-jovanovic,The absolute best Rocky movie,10,21 December 2006,"I cannot explain just how good this movie is. The crowd in the theater made it even better. It was about 100 people, 90% guys. Those 10% girls were dragged there by their boyfriends or husbands just like I did with my girlfriend. She was planning on sleeping during the entire movie because she never saw any of the first 5 and we went to see the late opening at 10:20PM. However, not only that she didn't sleep, for most of the time she didn't even blink how deep she was into the movie. I was re-living everything with Rocky as he is going thru irreversible changes in his life. Speeches he gives to the boxing commission and his son are amazing, they gave me chills. Stallone looks amazing at his age. He is quick, buff and fast. It was a very emotional experience for me as I have grown up with Rocky. At the end of the movie, entire theater and me (who NEVER did that before) applauded. I was overwhelmed by how good the saga ended. Rocky 5 never really did a good job and we've been waiting for 15 years for this. It paid off all the way. It was by far the best movie of the year, without a doubt.PS It wasn't just us Rocky fanatics, there were few couples maybe Stallone's age and there was 3 families that I saw that were there with little kids. Movie is OK for all ages.Rocky fan forever.",Rocky Balboa
608,DroogRETURNS,AMAZING! Only two words can explain it. Yo Adrain.,10,24 December 2006,"It was a heartfelt explosion. It was meaningful and delivered a lingering taste in your mouth for more. Out of all the Rcoky movies, this one is by far the best since the original. Stallone you have outdone yourself.The acting was superbe, the characters were realistic, and it was amazing how he was so build at 60. Stallone took this movie and made it a master piece. I swear, with the body he has at that age, he is like a tank.So, I only have two words that can sum this movie up right, and they are, Yo, Adrain.",Rocky Balboa
609,jmpmaztr,Go Rock,10,24 December 2006,"I saw 3 movies this weekend (We Are Marshall, The Good Shepherd, Rocky Balboa). Of the 3 I expected Marshall to be the best from the heart flick and Shepherd to be the best serious flick and Rocky to be the best popcorn flick but surprisingly Rocky was the best in all those categories. I was pleasantly surprised that Stallone went back to his roots on this one, but he did and it works. Sly is in great shape for the film and really gets the audience back in touch with the Rocky that we fell in love with in mid 70's. While Rocky II,III,IV were feel good popcorn fluff and Rocky V was an embarrassing money grab, Rocky Balboa puts the Rock back to his humble beginnings. There is probably an entire generation that has never seen the original but I believe if they see this movie they can get a feel of what 40something year olds like me felt in 1976. This was a true holiday surprise!",Rocky Balboa
610,jinpilar,"Great movie, great acting.",10,21 December 2006,"The movie is excellent. Usually, I'm not a Stallone fan, but now I am. There is a really good plot, Stallone is acting very well, whit intensity, and he is also in great shape e we can feel the conflicts, the pain, the tension during the hole movie. At the end, we leave theater with a smile in our face and a example to our lives. About Stallone's acting, I ca assure that he surprised me, because he is acting really naturally, without doing hard faces and ""cliches"". The rest of the team is also really good. The fighting scenes are truly remarkable, with real intense hits, jabs and all. The training sequences are really inspiring as we see the effort and resilience of the character. As I said, I was not a Stallone fan, but now I am, and I'll see Rocky Balboa again, and wait with great curiosity Sly's Rambo IV.",Rocky Balboa
611,mothepro,A reserved 'thumbs up' for this last in the series...,6,25 December 2006,"GENERAL - POSITIVE1) Significantly better than Rocky 5. A much better way to leave the series than with some weird street fight with a crazy kid. 2) More true to the original characters, spirit and the 'underdog' nature of Rocky Balboa. A masterpiece when you think of the level of difficulty involved to create a real reason for Rocky to return to the ring for a 6th time at his age. 3) To continue from point 2 - the idea of digital fight remastering of the hypothetical Rocky and the current champ? great idea!! TV interviews etc.. all this works great to help establish a motive for Rocky to return to the ring. 4) Paulie was a great success and added a crucial part to Rocky's performance. 5) Last but not least - Stallone's acting at times (in line with the Rocky character of course) was great. The best scene for me was with Paulie in the meat house with Rocky referring to his basement etc- gr8 stuff....Negatives...(yes there were some!!)1) Let's face it - Adrian should have been in this film. I recognise all the efforts were made to fill her void with restaurants, pictures, scenes by her grave, etc but it was simply a huge gap to leave open in this great series - especially at its conclusion - where the heck was she??? 2) What on earth is with this sub-plot with 'little Marie' and her son 'Steps'? If you are not going to have Adrian then you clearly need to spend all the time available building up the relationship between father and son - but this was woefully underplayed in the film with only a few scenes between them of real note. This got so bad that in the end there was a real weird scene when Steps and Rocky Junior acknowledged each other. So unnecessary and so irrelevant. 3) Apart from number 2, Rocky Junior was poorly played by Milo Ventimiglia. No real depth given to his character, much more could have been made from his role. To his credit, there was not a great deal he could have done with this weak part given to him. 4) Should have had a couple of initial bouts to authenticate his readiness for such a high-profile fight. Its one thing to refer to it as 'underdog' to fight the current world champ when you are a retired, 50+ year old fart, who hasn't trained in nearly 20 years. It's quite another to go into the ring without a single warm-up fight. That's just stupid. Overall - good.",Rocky Balboa
612,onehotmotherf,Nothings over till its over!,9,25 December 2006,"So now i have seen it, am i impressed? Absolutely!! Im a huge Stallone/ rocky fan my favourite movies of all time, was kind of dubious walking into the cinema wondering what to expect with this. I read some comments on here prior to seeing it and they really helped whilst watching this. One comment from a user read "" really good way to end the Rocky movies, does he live or die, watch it and find out"" obviously i am not going to tell you, but thinking that going into the final bout will have you thinking so much its unreal.This movie is like so many people have said back to the roots of Rocky, now this movie is not perfect but its a really good film none the less, i felt while watching it some scenes were a little too short and some were a little too long, none were bad at all but i felt there could have maybe been a little more Rocky/Paulie scenes. Was great to see Spider Rico and Marie from the earlier movies back in, which has always been a huge plus point for these movies, same cast over again awesome stuff, i see the idea behind the story but i feel there was still something missing without Adrian and Mickey, OK Burgess has passed away now R.I.P. But i still think the movie would have been perfect had Talia taken up her role of Adrian once again.From a huge Rocky fan though, a very good film back to roots of Rocky and totally worth a good viewing by any Stallone/Rocky fan. Long live Stallone and the legend of Rocky!",Rocky Balboa
613,ali_jawad21,A less than adequate conclusion to the series.,6,5 January 2007,"ROCKY, we all know who he is, but this film could have been something incredible, memorable and remarkably inspiring, but do you know what? I felt the the plot had not teeth, it was too elongated and there were parts that did not mean anything to the film or the man Rocky. It had its ups but mostly it was a let-down of such incredible potential. I completely respect Sylevester Stallone for making this film his and in his own way, but even though he tried his best i think that another director would have brought something new to the series. It was repetitive, over-hyped and in no way original. When I was younger Rocky used to be one of my inspirations and something that motivated me. I did not enjoy the story as it was very predictable and lacked the real motivation that it gives it to people.Nice try Mr Stallone,but this film did not please my eyes.",Rocky Balboa
614,you_win,Impressive Show by Stallone,9,2 January 2007,"When I first heard that there would be another Rocky movie, I thought it a joke. Was this really going to be another action hero trying to come back for one last go before they were put in the nursing home? However, after seeing the previews, my mind started to change, I found myself interested and even excited to see Rocky on the big screen again. Last week, I had the pleasure of seeing one of Stallone's best performances. As well, Stallone should think about directing more in his old age. Other than the fact that I did not like that the fight was filmed the same way that HBO does it, and the soundtrack lacked big time, the story was interesting and Rocky was as lovable as ever. Rocky gave some great inspirational speeches that made me want to take on the world. Good work all around. I look forward to more work by Stallone - I can't believe that I just wrote that.",Rocky Balboa
615,stef_VH,Stallones' uppercut places sixth establishment in old good feeling. Not many directors as actors could achieve that is in a industry drowning of remakes.,9,6 January 2007,The many Roman numbers that took the Rocky-series took al lot of character neglect of what was in the first Rocky saw as one moment in a lifetime of a underdog struggled boxer. But Stallones charismatic performance en Bill Conti's 'Gonna fly now' build out a iconic figure that would stand through the 80ths. The final episodes where execrable striped down to empty bodycounts that the dialogue-poor Rocky took in his ring. That first script had that ugly nesty streetlook that could be written by Paul Schraders hand. Most Americans define it as an Transatlantic classic but as this nonconvential film could stand out in the European region than i would be forced to write Mr. Stallones two thumbs up to accomplish the final en most satisfied round.,Rocky Balboa
616,MorganJones_33,It was a pretty good movie.,7,7 January 2007,"This was a good movie. But it never played eye of the tiger and i am pretty upset about it. The person over the music should be batch slapped just because he did not play eye of the tiger. But hey it's still cool. I am not complaining because I just like the song, but because it belonged on the movie. Yeah that's right i caught you. Yall thought that y'all could make a rocky movie without eye of the tiger without anyone noticing. But hey your wrong. LOL I have to say that it is still good and people should go see it.

The movie teaches people from all generations and ethnic backgrounds that life is a battle and it is not what you CAN do but how MUCH you can do to stay standing victorious..I thought Sylvester Stallone was not the best of actors after watching Demolition Man and Judge Dredd but watching this movie brought tears to my eyes.. because his acting was simply fantastic. There is a speech in the movie in which he really brings out his emotions and it is one you'll never forget it...if you are in two minds about watching this movie.. go see it.. you wont be disappointed.. it is a film for all the family..,Rocky Balboa
619,filmkid-6,Final Round for Rocky Can Go All The Way,8,11 January 2007,"In the latest and hopefully last instalment Rocky Balboa is worth seeing. But i will have to admit to appreciate this film just a little bit more you must see the original. For Sylvestor Stallone writing,and directing this film he should get as much recognition as possible. When i first saw the trailer i couldn't believe it that they would really do this,i mean see a 60 year old man box agaisnt a undefeated professional boxer,the set up is kind of a joke but i was very wrong. This film which is rated pg is good for everyone to see,its a good, fun movie which is rare nowadays in movies. I don't like giving away anything in movies but just know this if you don't appreciate the film for a 60 year old man being in great shape fighting,then go because you'll be entertained somehow.",Rocky Balboa
620,matthiasbeebe,i loved this movie,10,9 January 2007,"The plot itself could probably have done with some improvement, for example more detail regarding Rocky's desire to go back to fighting might have helped. I guess the movie perhaps should have been longer to prevent a bit of a rushed feeling to some of the segments. But overall this movie has a lot of the same atmosphere a the first one, and there are moments in it that are just as touching and uplifting. I think Sylvester Stallone really poured his heart into this one, and the emotions are infectious enough that you can't help but be drawn in, not only to the movie but to the whole concept of Stallone making this movie. I suppose I'm a sucker for the early Rocky movies and this one really evokes the same kind of excitement and magic charge. Definitely a good movie for Rocky fans.",Rocky Balboa

It is not a cash cow for Stallone! If you grew up with Rocky, if you went to school having seen it and spent days acting out what you'd seen, if the der derr der der theme music makes you get goose bumps, then this is going to be one of the best films you have ever seen!It is sad for first 20 mins or so, as Rocky struggles with the loss of Adrian, and there was a point i was really worried there was going to be a love story develop, with the excellent Geraldine Hughes, but the film was above that. But through his struggle with life, his son, and of course paulie, Stallone makes this the film of his life. Will it repeat the Oscar win of the original? Not sure, but, it is a great film, and i don't award 10 out of 10 lightly. Enjoy.",Rocky Balboa

I really enjoyed the virtual fight scene. How much can you cram into a five minute long scene!?! But if Sly did it then it is possible. The music to it was absolutely phenomenal! I wish I could write music like that. But probably the most outstanding scenes have to the fitness scene (i wish i could run that far or not get out of breath that fast) and the actual 'rematch'. Not a brilliant script but I don't think that really matters as long as there's action, humour, drama, romance and not forgetting SPORTS!!!!! Please make a Rocky VII (7). If you did I would be your biggest fan!!!",Rocky Balboa
626,Jeremywa,A Powerhouse 10!,10,24 April 2007,"This movie without a doubt is a true Rocky movie. There's heart, pain, fighting, humor, and it's very entertaining. This movie really pulls you in on a emotional stand point just like number 2 does. This is definitely the best Rocky since Rocky II. It's just hard not to feel for Rocky America's hero who's living a lonely life, and who struggles to deal with his wife being gone everyday. Stallone delivers powerful heart felt acting, and created a movie truly based on someone's heart, and how that carry's them through possibly the roughest part of life. Rocky is happy with life, except he struggles without Adrian. Paulie cannot help Rocky in this matter because of the simple fact he feels bad for treating Adrian bad, and it hurts for him to think of her being gone as well. Rocky wants to be close to his son Robert, but Robert is reluctant because he feels his father casts a big shadow, therefore making his life harder than what it should be. Rocky begins to once again befriend Marie, a young girl he met 30 years earlier. She and Rocky become close as he also becomes sort of a male figure for her son Steps. Rocky runs a restaurant named ""Adrians"", which is full of pictures of Adrian, Rocky's media coverage, pictures and awards, and them together. Really basically its a mural of his life. Paulie begins to tell Rocky about a computer fight that had him winning , and it comes on TV. Although Rocky wins the computer decision most sports announces talk badly about him. This really hurts Rocky from an emotional standpoint, and makes him feel as if he has more to give, and something to prove. Rocky tells Robert, and his son about how he wants to fight locally and they both think it's a bad idea. Now Rocky is stuck as if nobody believes in him. Rocky gets a boxing license after giving a heart felt speech to the Pennsylvania boxing commission. This really doesn't make Robert happy, as it does his friends. Mason Dixon doesn't want the fight, and is tired of being disrespected by the people, and the media. His managers knowing that Rocky is still very popular with the people think its a good idea that can help Mason get respect, and make a lot of money. He agrees, after arguing with his people about the match. So the match is set and many announcers begin to taunt Rocky, but Dixon as well. This is where the movie really gets good. Paulie after thirty years gets fired from the meat house, and only has one person to turn to his best friend Rocky. So Rocky gets some motivational words told to him from Paulie, and now there back on the same side of things. Stallone (Rocky) delivers a wonderful heart felt father to son speech to Robert about how he isn't going to have a life until he starts believing in himself, after Robert tells him not to fight, and its to hard living under his shadow. After Rocky sits his son strait, Robert goes to visit him at the graveyard. Robert tells Rocky he quit to be with him. This is so heart felt, and truly touching, as Rocky has his son with him to push him through what he's going to face. Rocky trains much like the old days. Tony Burton (Duke), Rocky's old trainer, and Apollo's returns. Rocky runs to the truly inspiring ""Gonna Fly Now"", lifts weights, beer kegs, and other exercise to the song. At the weigh in Dixon who doesn't want the match tells Rocky not to press him, and he will carrying him. Rocky isn't accepting of the idea. During the fight Dixon isn't taking things serious as Rocky, and his people are. Much like Apollo wasn't taking his first fight with Rocky serious. Rocky has a hard time keeping up with the champ in the first round, and takes a complete beating. In the second round, Dixon still pummels Balboa until he breaks his hand on Rocky's body after knocking him down twice. Rocky comes to life and begins pounding the champ with body shots, knocking him down, and beating him in the face as well. This is a wake up for Dixon and the war is on. Throughout the fight Dixon and Rocky beat the crap out of each other, and Rocky doesn't quit. This is proved in the last night when Rocky gets up after a veracious hook that nearly knocked his head backwards. During the fight you are also treated to the song ""Conquest', and flashbacks of Mickey, Adrian, and Robert. Rocky loses in a decision by 1 point. But to the fans, Rocky won. Rocky leaves the area for one last time, while thousands chant his name. This movie isn't about winning it's about heart, and never giving up. It's basically about going for the distance even when most people already count you out. This is a classic Rocky film, and has all the required elements needed to be a powerful touching movie. Im giving Stallone praises for making this magical film. Well done, very well done Sly. This is something anybody can relate to. We all feel the fire to prove ourselves, go the distance, and this helps us realize when we get a shot to do so we can't pass the opportunity up.",Rocky Balboa
627,Reg682,Stallone a bit rusty directing,7,21 March 2007,"The positive about ROCKY BALBOA is that it brings a closure (one would hope) to a character that seems more alive than fiction, even for us Brits. Even tough we wrongfully love when films leave endings a bit up to the audience.Europeans connect with the Rocky series because we were more enamoured with America back in the 70's, when the first Rocky was released, than we are now, in general. It was something new, and the average foreigner really had never been to the USA, therefore it was a connection to see how the country operated from the downtrodden slums to the grand stage.The negative remarks are really regarding film-making, in that it is obviously re-tread material, and there is not much else to talk about script-wise, other than the past.Today, after 6 films of the series, I'm glad to see what happened to Rocky and I do hope Mr. Stallone has no plans for a seventh, but you can almost feel that its possible.How about his son becoming a fight manager, a family struggle ensues when Rocky finds out he is managing his fathers worst enemy? On second thought.",Rocky Balboa

All credit to Stallone who has again given us an uplifting tale.All performances are great and the way the final fight has been crafted (a departure from the other Rocky films)is just brilliant and refreshing and made me smile and cheer throughout.It's great to hear the famous Rocky music and to see him pounding the steps once more and if this really is the end fro this underdog character then it's a magnificent way to go out. The lower budget just gives this film a creative edge and I for one would love to see it up for an Oscar just like the original all those years ago.",Rocky Balboa

If you are down on your luck and are looking for a movie to inspire and push you forward then you must see Rocky Balboa.The moral lessons told through these characters are incredibly powerful and relate to human values within people of all ages. Rocky Balboa is a symbolic character that represents spirit, hope, confidence, power, and love. He rises above all odds to accomplish a goal that many think is unthinkable and illogical.I encourage families and individuals from around the world to look away from the Hollywood critic viewpoints and instead at the simple truthsthroughout this movie.

How can you critique some movies and say ""its too fake and never would happen"" but you watch a movie about people fighting on another planet. You people are just haters against Rocky movies, and don't have a life. I mean goodness come up with a better reason why this movie is awful besides the fact that ""rocky is too old and he could never do that"".

I consider 5 a necessary part of the cycle no matter what the SPORTS GUY (ESPN) thinks of it. It showed how Rocko came full circle and still was on top. The movie was more like the original dark and serious. It almost seemed like Stallone was making it autobiographical at times by showing what he's going through now as a 61 year old. Stallone has two of the biggest and best characters ever from Cinema's Past. Besides Harrison Ford and a select few others who else has two strong characters such as him.

632,awdrwr143,Rocky Balboa,10,27 October 2007,"Rocky Balboa was one of my favorite sports movie. It shows that just because you have had 50 or more birthdays it does not mean you can not follow your dream. Also I am also glad they kept the same actors. Because I have seen all the other Rocky movies and I might not have seen this movie if they had changed up the actors. All the other Rocky movies were great but this one was the best because in this one Rocky Balboa went up against the odds and followed his dreams. The amazing part was when he was in the court room and fighting for his right to be a professional boxer again. But, I thought it was very sad that they had Adrian die thought. I thought it was great though that Rocky named his new restaurant after her. I also thought it was great that Rocky helped out that girl that worked at the bar and her son. I also liked how Rocky stood up for her when that drunk dude was being a ass to her. I thought the beginning of the movie was great but when I so Rocky Balboa the Italian Stalian I just got so exited. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was when they decided to end the natch in a draw. I mean seriously. That is a pretty weak ending to end a six movie series. If they had had Rocky win I would give it a 9/10 but since they ended it in a tie I am giving it a 8/10 because it showed me that you don't have to be twenty-three chugging steroids to be a legend. And also you should be nice to old people. You never know what's gonna happen to you.",Rocky Balboa
633,bunny_tz-1,An ants look into Rocky Balboa.,8,3 December 2007,"Sylvester Stallone brings yet again the fighting warrior ""Rocky Balboa"" for another couple of rounds of boxing, which brings one of the most long loved/hated sagas of all time to the conclusion it deserved.I don't like to write any comments that may contain spoilers or even try to redirect readers to any kind of reaction to a movie, reaction that has already been hot brewed by all kind of criticism towards the actor, the director, the writer and the movie itself.So, why did i rated 8/10 this Rocky Balboa?I long wished for a decent ending for this saga and, since i was heavily disappointed with Rocky V, my hopes were not that high for this final movie. I know that it was going to be more of the same, and here resides the turmoil of this movie: critics and haters say this Rocky Balboa is more of the same...and well they say it right. But lets face it: was anyone expecting something else? I mean, when you face a movie saga do you find anything different from the first tittle to the last one? Maybe someone out there thinks that all ""James Bond"" movies are original and different from one and another...i hope not.So ""Rocky Balboa"" will remain, nonetheless, as the final chapter of this saga, where the viewer will be presented to some of the aspects of Rockys life, his current job, family relations, etc, all of them told in a rather ""cheesy"" way which i found to be not very far from what i would expect from Stallone direction. The acting is not very good, although i liked yet again the fine small role of an powerful Burt Young, and to be honest about it even Sly had some fine moments in the movie. The small role presented to us of Rockys son was filled by a solid Milo Ventimiglia that, although not being able this time to move objects with his mind, he was still able to pull an somewhat believable performance. Plot is very straightforward, some nice ""cheesy"" moments that will let the more sensible viewers cry a tear or two, some holes on it also, plenty of life history lessons too, well the full Stallone package of all the other Rocky movies. The sets, score, clothing, photography are just more of the same.So, the answer to the question is simple: this takes a score of 8 out of 10 because as a film its better than i expected, it beats other Rocky films (except 1st one) by miles, its more mature and if we could take all 6 movies, cut them open, split all of them to pieces and put them back together to 3 movies of 1h30 each...well, what a great trilogy we would have with a somewhat powerful ending like this ""Rocky Balboa"" is.The Good: low expectations turns into a nice, pleasant smile as you watch the movie. Stallone at his best mature acting. (almost ""Copland"" part 2). Rocky saga is over.The Bad: more of the same acting, plot directing and cheesy lines.The Villain: the guy sitting next to me crying all the time.Fans: go watch it. Movie watchers: rent DVD. Movie haters: why be so angry all the time? Come on give me a smile. :)",Rocky Balboa
634,enigma511,A nice end to the series and lots of modesty from Stallone.,10,21 December 2006,"When I first turned this movie on I was almost expecting sever hours of training followed by rocky beating the hell out of someone. Instead I was nicely surprised by a continuing story line more about Rocky's life than his career.Considering the movie was written by Stallone himself I felt he wrote his role very modestly and in a way it made the movie a lot more enjoyable and realistic. The realism was also nicely complimented with small features such as an actual timer in some of the rounds of the end fight.Overall not the best movie in the series but definitely a nice finish to the story. If your just watching this movie for the action I suggest you fast forward until you hear Rocky's trainer say ""Now lets build some hurting bombs!"".",Rocky Balboa

636,cookcolin1,The Real Rocky 5,7,13 October 2008,"The Rocky series holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. Seeing a Rocky movie connects me to other favorite movies from growing up, those films you've seen by now countless times, and still can enjoyably watch. Such films Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Terminator. Despite the backlash of some critics for the continuation of such series after so many years have passed, why not continue something that is proved good entertainment. Hollywood is remaking perfectly good and not very old movies these days, so what's wrong with continuing a series after many years. In Rocky Balboa's case it works! Would you have preferred a remake? After watching the original Rocky, and I mean really watching the original Rocky as a film, you can see the essence of what the series continued on as. It was a cool boxing movie yes but, it made us emotional and attached the character. The overcome the odds, underdog tale, about a guy who's a guy and he works his ass off and gets it done. Brilliant right? It's tried and true but not automatic and the first Rocky was something above the other ones. Why? Because the first Rocky could have stood the test of time without the others. The 2,3,4,5, and Balboa could have never existed, and there, on your TV, to your excitement, is Rocky on a cable TV channel at 11pm on a Tuesday. The end of the movie was unique. The end was there was no end. That being said, the trilogy continued on, with some pretty cool fights and a similar underdog theme, each with outstanding characters and new challenges.Rocky Balboa should have been Rocky 5. If Stallone could have played a 50 some year old fighter who steps into the ring one last time in 1990 then it should have been done. It took these years to close the chapter of Rocky. We learn valuable things with age. The once mixed up, shy and poorly spoken Rocky of old yields to the older, wiser, more independent Rocky of the new. He has proved himself and no longer wonders what it would be like. Instead, he has other challenges. The fight is a physical part of Rocky's life that he must train for. But life itself is what Rocky really battles. A life that is relentless in its challenges. One that always takes and despite who you are or what you have done, you always will have challenges to meet. It just never ends.So Rocky meets the final challenge that we will most likely see. And it's fitting. The series that is so special to many of us, or exciting, or cool, has finally found its closing chapter. Not only is it another boxing movie, with similar themes of the underdog and the nice regular kinda guy. It also develops the theme of Rcoky further. The movie focuses on one man, and seeing his progression, and the knowledge he has gained, who he has become and what he knows as true is something that surpasses a cheap remake of something we already know. A sigh of relief and some closure.",Rocky Balboa
637,aldebaran4523,Best Rocky ever,10,6 January 2007,"For fans of the franchise who grew up watching Rocky, this film makes so much sense, it brings so much warmth that only the bitter sweet nostalgia of the past can do. I'm a kid of the 80s and i just couldn't help being immersed in that nostalgia. Finding myself being stuck in the past just like Rocky is. There is no shame in that. The past has always been warmer, wiser, richer, the past has nothing to be afraid of the present, only thing to be afraid of, is not to deliver the hard earned knowledge and experience, as heritage to the new generation.Rocky, in his 60s, still has that burning fire in him. Not only to fight one last fight, to prove that he is more than just a mind, stuck in the past, with a bunch of old stories to tell, but to teach his son some hard learned lessons about life.Yeah, Rocky matured. He became wiser. And it was wonderful to see him finish his life story at a peak, full of respect and acknowledgment for who he was.I found myself crying through the powerful dialogs that Rocky had with Paulie and his son. Probably Stalone's best performance in his whole career.To conclude, I give it a 10 cause it just couldn't be any better. Thanks for believing in this movie Sly. It was really worth making.",Rocky Balboa

Yes, there few movies, which were able to make me drop a scoop of a tear from one eye, but this film... it's something incredible. Its mood, Stallone's performance, the feel of how short and fast life is, the genuine feel of nostalgia, it was just.. wow. It kept me crying like an emo girl through the whole film. I have never experienced this before. This film is made for men, it is made to make men cry.

You HAVE to see this movie, this is the greatest surprise of the year. I'm glad to see that Sly still can surprise us ! The only great miss was the song Eye of the tiger, for me, like no other original song. The fight against Mason is not like the fight against Drago, for me, the best fight of the series, so far, or the 1st movie fight, but it's the third best.

I hated 4 and 5.I had no interest in seeing this movie. Zilch. None. 5 was so horrible, there was no way I was going to see this movie.There's my back story.It's Christmas. I didn't know what to get my best friend. He is a die-hard fan. I know his girlfriend was not going to go see Rocky Balboa. I figured i'd suck it up and take him to the movie toss in a few drinks and food and that would be his Xmas gift.He was shocked cause we already had a talk about how i was not going to go see this movie under any circumstances.Now I'm shocked. I enjoyed it. I really actually liked it. I'm sure my low expectations had something to do with it, but people cheered when the movie was over. Lotta applause and cheers.Gotta give props.

It's as if my grandpa could suddenly become a pro tennis player 2006(Yeah he was good at tennis back in 1976).""Balboa's age is never stated in this film. It is mentioned that he is in his 50s, but nothing more is said. Stallone was 59 while filming Rocky Balboa,"" and was 60 years old by the time of its release. Since Rocky was ""pushing 30"" in the first film, and this film takes place a few years Adrian's death in 2002, it can be assumed Balboa is in his late 50s.""Perhaps people who watch the film are either nostalgic sly/Rocky fans and shut their eyes for that fact,or doesn't know anything about boxing. , the rest of the film considering Sly is writer and director surprisingly good except for the standard cliché tricks to gain the audience hearts.",Rocky Balboa
642,mjpooch,Powerful film on many levels,10,23 December 2006,"At the surface, this film is simply nothing more than a Rocky film, a fitting end to one of the best sagas in film history. Then, after you see the film, you start to see and appreciate the film's depth - just as was the case with the Oscar-winning original.The film is not about boxing, so much as some of its weaker predecessors, it's about believing in yourself, staying true to who you are, and never giving up hope.A heart-warming movie that will have you cheering from start to finish. Another interesting note about this film is the way that the antagonist, Mason Dixon, was portrayed. he is not a villain, an opponent we are supposed to hate just because he is fighting Rocky, a la Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. Instead, he too is a man struggling to find his own way and to overcome his own adversity as well.This movie is obviously a must-see for any fan of the series, but it's a must see for any movie fan who needs a reason to believe in the power of the human heart.",Rocky Balboa
643,merc14,Rocco,10,22 December 2006,"Just got home from seeing Rocky Balboa. What a great movie. Sylvester Stallone has really redeemed himself as a beloved icon. In his older years he has gained a bittersweet humility and it comes through in Rocky's soul searching answers to Paulie about why he wants to fight again. Those of us in our older years can certainly relate to the melancholy remembrance of the past. Some of us are uplifted by it, like Rocky and his love for Adrian. Some of us are burdened by regret which is expressed so tragically by Paulie. Sly gives a wistful, sweet, and nuanced performance which I can't help thinking comes from the heart of someone who is trying to reclaim his self-respect. Burt Young returns to great form as the caustic Paulie. There are colorful scenes of the street market in Philadelphia, and stay for the credits which has a montage of people running up the famous steps. Go see this movie.",Rocky Balboa

Because Rocky wins a computer-simulated match against the current champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, an exhibition is set. Rocky's trainer, Duke, makes no bones about Rocky's deficiencies, and Rocky adjusts his regimen to maximize his odds for another impossible fight.Does he go the distance, or does the obvious physical disadvantage finally work against him?

So it weighs out to be about an above average movie to me, especially since I felt a little left out from not seeing the other five movies.

Some good support, too and the story isn't as far fetched as it might have been, considering the basis of the film. A good mixture of story telling and action from a convincing cast.If you take out the guff of Rockys 2 to 5 and simply look at 1 and 6, they are two very powerful tales of a fighter's rise against the odds. Credit to Stallone for having the faith to put out a sixth movie in the series, he must have had his doubters and in this return to the original theme, sees a re-birth of a legend.However, I hope there isn't a 7th, this is as good as it gets, any way is downhill from here.",Rocky Balboa
647,dpm-5,A grand close to a grand series of films.,9,20 December 2006,"Having seen all five of the previous 'Rocky' films, I awaited the release of 'Rocky Balboa' with eager anticipation, but also with a sense of trepidation: would this be another glorified music video, as some say 'Rocky IV' was? Would this be another movie that made me cringe, as 'Rocky V' did? Fortunately, the answer to these questions turned out to be a resounding ""no."" And I, as a fan of the series since childhood, am ever so grateful.'Rocky Balboa' starts not with a bang, but a whimper (but in a good way); a lot has happened since we last saw Rocky knocking Tommy Gunn into a Philadelphia city bus in 1990: he and Adrian started a restaurant in 1995, son Robert Jr. matriculated and went into the business world (apparently with little to mixed success), and most sadly to the audience, at the beginning of the film we learn that Adrian, the heart and soul of Rocky's conscience, died on January 11, 2002.Almost five years later, Rocky seems to be going through the motions of his life - he runs the restaurant, he tells stories to the patrons about the good old days - the kind of thing you'd expect from any sports celebrity that takes a crack at being a restaurateur. But its evident that Rocky has pain bottled up inside him - pain from Adrian's death mostly, but pain from within as well.On the anniversary of Adrian's death, we see Rocky and Paulie (played by Burt Young, who gets second billing this time around) visiting the old haunts that Rocky shared with Adrian: the pet shop, which appears closed; the ice rink, that's now been felled by a wrecking ball. Rocky's living in the past, and while Rocky's memories of it are somewhat comforting to him, they are a source of pain to Paulie.Enter the reigning heavyweight champion of the world, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, who despite his cartoonish name seems like a decent enough guy. Played by former Light Heavyweight kingpin Antonio Tarver, Dixon isn't so much an unpopular champion as he is dominant - his fights aren't bringing in the dollars because, like Roy Jones Jr. for most of his career, you pretty much knew the outcome, and didn't really care about the opponents.ESPN moves the storyline along by staging a computerized series of bouts between heavyweight champions in an effort to determine who was the best of all time. The network pairs Dixon and Balboa and, of course, Rocky wins by knockout. The fight has Rocky thinking that the way to get his inner demons out of his system is to fight again - just local, small fights - just to get through his anger and pain.Rocky gets his boxing license despite allegedly having brain damage in 'Rocky V' (a departure from the canon that isn't explained in nearly enough detail), but before he does much else Dixon's promoters (played by A.J. Benza and real-life promoter Lou DiBella) visit Rocky at the restaurant, named ""Adrian's"": would he be willing to take on the champ in a 10-round exhibition? Rocky's no dummy. He's an aged warhorse, Dixon's a stallion. Rocky worries about ""getting mangled,"" but after the promoters assuage his fears, he's on board. Meanwhile, Robert's not happy with Dad's decision, pleading with him not to go through with the fight (Robert's a lot like his mother, apparently). Rocky tells his son that he's scared, but that (in essence) life isn't about your successes, but how you overcome adversities: ""It ain't about how hard you can hit, but how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward."" Robert doesn't get it initially, but eventually it sinks in that his old man is more wise than he gives credit for.I won't give away too many details about the fight itself, other than just one: you either think you know what's going to happen and are surprised, or you guess right and think to yourself, ""interesting."" Either way, this is no re-hash of 'Rocky III's' battles between Rocky Balboa and Clubber Lang.Also, credit to Sylvester Stallone for doing something in this film that he hadn't done in any of the previous five - aimed for realism. Now that sounds bizarre when you think that this is a movie about a guy in his 50's fighting the reigning heavyweight champion of the world, but the fight scene looks as if it were straight out of an HBO pay-per-view event. Another nice touch was to see Rocky's belts hanging on the wall at Adrian's - not ""The Ring"" belt worn by the Rock in 'Rocky III' or placed on Apollo Creed's coffin in 'Rocky IV,' but replicas of the current sanctioning body belts.As pessimistic as I was about the concept of 'Rocky Balboa,' I have to say this is the second best, if not the best, of the series. You don't leave the theater chanting 'Rocky! Rocky!', but if you were paying attention, you not only left with an uplifting feeling in your heart, but you might just have learned a thing or two to boot.",Rocky Balboa
648,EviL-DoeR,The best Rocky movie since the first!,10,27 December 2006,"And in some very brilliant ways it out shines the first! I will say that I have been a big big Rocky & Rambo fan since I was able to even speak! So I got all gitty with geekness when I heard that Sly was making a comeback, and was going to do 2 sequels. I hated part 5 but in this movie they fix the mistakes from the last movies, and sly actually made a movie which was as touching as the original, and as emotional as the first. Sly should win an academy award for both ACTOR & Director! Great job, and this is by far the best movie of 2006! I hope that he does a good a job on the new Rambo movie as he did on this one because if he does man I swear I will be forever happy! Anyway awesome movie, and hope everyone goes to see it at least 3 times! This movie is not only a worthy new entry into the Rocky saga but it also does what a lot didn't think could happen! It does a magical job of wrapping the entire thing up. Stallone who has had a lot of critics on his acting over the years silences them all with how he plays the role of Rocky Balboa. Every time you see him sad it breaks your heart because it's a character we have invested 30 years to, and in this movie they play up to that nostalgic feel. Unlike the last one which was flat from start to finish. Rocky 5 had a great story behind it, and the only thing that stopped it from being a good movie was the shady directing, and the way over the top characters. Felt more like a movie which had the entire production staff just going thru the motions instead of really putting their hearts into it. Now with Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) we get a real ending to the saga, and a movie that leaves you in tears. The Rocky character is one which will be in our hearts for ever! Its part of pop culture just like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and a few other films. To end this short review id like to thank Sly once again for sticking to his guns, and getting the movie he wanted made, and didn't bow down to the big studios which would have made trash. This is the most worth watching Rocky movie since Rocky 1.... Thank you Mr Stallone.Can't wait for John Rambo! lol",Rocky Balboa

I have to admit, the emotional scenes got me, well, emotional. They were well done, very well done. The acting was great, and, in my personal opinion, Sly did his best performance yet.Rocky 1 was the original, a great movie. The follow-ups were good as well, but as we all know, sequels, etc, aren't always as great as the original.

650,RevelationXRed,Fans of 'Rocky' will find a sense of closure here.,8,21 December 2006,"'Rocky Balboa' is as much about closure as it is about telling a new story, and to that extent, this sixth and final (?) installment works extremely well. Fans of the series will notice after the first thirty minutes that this movie uses the formula of the first movie to draw (ie Rocky is pulled into the ring for what is largely a publicity stunt). More than that, the story is not based around Rocky's actual fight, but the struggle that Rocky faces as time begins to catch up with him. Though it may be less glamorous than the souped up, grandiose characters that brought 'Rocky III' and 'Rocky IV' to life, the characters and their struggles make this installment a far better film than movies II-V.The film is, of course, not without its flaws. Stallone seemed to have a tough time crafting the story around extraneous characters, while certain characters were criminally underused to the point that their presence was really unnecessary. Yet if you consider yourself a fan of the Rocky series, you really owe it to yourself to watch this movie. Easily the second best film in the franchise, it adds a sense of closure to not only a character, but really a staple-pin of a generation that has since passed on.",Rocky Balboa
651,David_C_Frison,Some negligence kept this film from being AWESOME!,10,14 December 2006,"CONS: - Week story. - All the messages the audience are supposed to get throughout the movie are not subtly divulged, they are thrown in your face by verbal explanations of the characters. - Some acting performances. - The dog. - The lack of development and depth of key characters like Paulie, Rocky Jr. and Duke. Instead that very irrelevant dog took some precious minutes that could have been used for that purpose. - Rocky's motivation not showing well or not enough.PROS: - The emotions the viewer goes trough are TREMENDOUS*; the more familiar or the bigger fan of the Rocky persona you are, the greater the impact. That alone redeems the movie a heck of a lot. (So much so I voted 8/10) - The soundtrack! - The messages though, are wonderful. - The humor. - Rocky (Sly) is back, and AGAIN, he brings out the best in us.*I am in the movie business, I hardly ever cry... Let alone 4 times in one movie!!! Fans will understand.",Rocky Balboa
652,Tomatoman5,Fans of the series will love this film!,9,21 December 2006,"I have been looking forward to this movie since the first talks about it began and there's no question, if you love the other Rocky films, you will love this film. And a much better way to end the Rocky saga then Rocky 5. This movie will have you cheering as hard as you did in the first Rocky. Stallone did right by his legacy and his fans. Its evident he wanted to go out with a little more punch (no pun intended) than we received (or didn't) from Rocky 5. The emotion is there, the cinematography is there, the characters (minus Adrian) are there. Its the full package. Rocky left fans hungry for more. Rocky Balboa is the main course. See this movie, you'll want to stand up and cheer!",Rocky Balboa
653,CASJDS,Bring a box of Tissues to this one!!!,10,27 December 2006,"BRAVO, BRAVO I thought Rocky Balboa was a great film and a sentimental send of for that Character, The critics that call it cliché or have reviewed it in a negative light, Just don't get it and never will, I feel you are underrated as not only an Actor and writer but a director as well I hope one day you get to film your Edgar Allen Poe film, Rocky Balboa the movie moves extremely well, it wastes no time I feel you hit every moment, especially the scenes with Burt Young. The movie captured me right from the start it effected me along with the character I was moved throughout the movie and yes I wanted to cheer Rocky,Rocky,Rocky,Rocky at the end, You pulled it off Mr. Stallone I just wanted to say ""thank you for creating the character Rocky,"" Your writing and performance of that character should go down in the annals of cinema as one of, if not the greatest characters EVER! (Ok so maybe ever is a little much) But there is no way any critic or industry insider can ever take away what you have created.Rocky is what ever American or human should aspire to be the best that one can be,",Rocky Balboa
654,fletch2594,Rocky Balboa - back to His Best,10,20 January 2007,"I went into this rocky film and thought that it could go wrong being that Stallone was 60 and I was told that the shots on the fight wern't very audible and it was a little boring.these rumours were wrong, the film was fantastically done and the fight was realistic and the shots still sounded good like older films (just a tiny toned down).The fact that Stallone decided to come back and not let Rocky win (against all odds yet again) was a good thing, he was in it to make Rocky last the distance, he did, and lost by decision, this helped say goodbye to Rocky and helped Mason Dixon's career like this. A good fight to end the Rocky franchise (hopefully, it should be the last).Many scenes were touching and especially the first few when he is looking at all the places he saw Adrian. He takes us on an emotional trip which some of the other Rocky films don't take us very far into. It matches the original for drama and emotion and very much holds its own in the fighting scenes.The training montage wasn't the best but still was pretty good. It was helped by some funny moments like Paulie trying to lift some weights unsuccessfully. And Duke at first with some witty comments ""a shot which would make him feel like he just kissed the express train"" (cracks his neck).the fight looked very much like a pay per view and it was very realistic, it looked good, professionally and well done. And having the crowd there with a great atmosphere and the announcers, ring attendant with the immortal words ""ladies and gentlemen and millions watching at home, lets get ready to... RUMBLE!!!"" added to the spectacle.the fight was a little short for a Rocky fight but that didn't stop it from being a good one. the first round is Mason's and it looks well choreographed, and during the second when Rocky gets going, it is just marvellous watching the performance form the two. As it skips to the final few rounds the weariness sets in but still has some good shots. when the final bell went I felt relieved that rocky made it to the end and was elated that he had done it.the fact that he didn't win dosn't matter and is almost irrelevant. rocky Balboa is an emotional journey with a great fight to boot. One to watch and one for my DVD collection when it comes out!",Rocky Balboa
655,predator123,"Good, not great",7,29 December 2006,Just seen a advanced screening of Rocky Balboa and left wanted more. Usually that is great in a movie but not in this case.Reason being Sly said this was going to be the last ever Rocky and there is no coming back from this one. But without spoiling the film for those who have not seen it this is not true. I could think of several story lines for rocky 7.As far as cinematography goes it is the best of the series and looks very sharp with some great scenes.My only gripe is Antonio Tarver. Now I've never liked him as a boxer anyway so when i heard he was casted for this role i knew he would bring it down. His acting is poor (yes worse then Tommy gun before people ask).Overall this movie has that great Rocky feeling and emotion that fans will love.7/10,Rocky Balboa
656,nab1,Actually very moving! A wonderful closure to the Rocky series. NO SPOILERS!,10,7 January 2007,"I had the chance to see the movie this week and I have to say it was an excellent Rocky movie. A great way to end the series. It's bittersweet seeing Rocky's last fight. A word of advice, if you have not seen the Rocky movies or it's been a long time since the last time you've seen them, try to have a little Rocky marathon before seeing this movie. The new movie will have a greater emotional impact on you if you do. I actually did this with a few of my friends that knew who Rocky was but never really saw all the movies. Be warned that Rocky V is the weakest sequel though. We watched that in double speed. In the end though, we really felt that Rocky Balboa was an excellent ending to what was a thrilling ride. So if you get a chance see Rocky on the big screen one last time, it will be well worth it. Sly still can direct some of the best boxing scenes in movies.",Rocky Balboa
657,road_warrior1313,The Final Chapter of the Greatest Underdog Ever,8,22 December 2006,"Rising up from the streets of Philadelphia to being world heavyweight champion of the boxing world was not easy for Rocky Balboa, as seen in the early Rocky movies. With Rocky V being very disappointing, the skepticism for Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI) was quite high.In the early stages of the movie, we see Rocky Balboa as the 60 year old man who is in mourning and unable to let go of the past. With the help of his best friend, Paulie, Rocky begins to attack his inner beast and release it to the world.With Rocky's son, Rocky Jr., feeling he lives in the shadow of his father, it is very touching to see the pain that goes through Rocky's face when he realizes the shadow he has cast. However, Rocky Jr. has to learn to make his own decisions and not rely on what everyone thinks.With Mason ""The Line"" Dixon world champ and beating every opponent with seeming ease, he is quickly losing fan support, and the boxing world is losing interest. However, a computer simulated fight of today's Dixon vs. yesteryear's Balboa sparks up interest when the computer Balboa knocks out Dixon in the first round.The only way for Rocky to release all of his aggressions is to get back in the ring and see what he has. With some persuasion, Rocky gets his boxing license and is ready for his chance to be back. Billed as an exhibition, the match the world has been waiting for is going to happen: Balboa vs. Dixon. New vs. Old. Does Rocky still have what it takes to spur with Dixon? No movie can match the feelings generated like Rocky I, but this movie does provide a good closing to the greatest underdog story ever. Whether it be with your family or your friends, this is a movie everyone needs to see. It brings back the great emotions I felt watching the original Rocky movies and makes me miss the old time movies. Watch this movie!",Rocky Balboa

I like the quote ""If you're willing to go through all the battling you got to go through to get where you want to get, who's got the right to stop you?"" Rocky tells his son who loses the courage of life that when you in trouble , do not blame ,it is cowards done. Rocky is a spirit on behalf . It is a spirit that a man keep moving for his love and dream. We will always get problems in common life. As Rocky said,we should not blame anyone.

All of the movies, including 5, gave me the will the better myself. And this one lives up to that! The movie starts with the traditional scrolling across the screen ""Rocky"" and the opening credits plays ""Take You Back"", it got a good reaction out of the audience on opening night. The movie then goes and shows a day in the life of Rocky, which was a real tear jerker. The rest of the movies goes a lot like the first one went. But when the training and fight came, everyone in the theater was cheering. The movie has the magic of the first, second, and fifth one and has the action of the third and forth one. It was a good wrap up to the series and the Rocky fans across the world will be sitting on the edges of their seats. This is a must see, no doubt about it! Good job Sly, you did it!",Rocky Balboa
660,xxzerohopexx,Best Rocky Yet!,10,25 December 2006,"I normally never write reviews... in fact this is my first one.. and only doing so because the one i just read for this page was nothing but a blabbering rant of useless information, that did nothing to render an opinion about the movie.. Thus here's my little rantI personally thought this was the best Rocky movie, because this is the first Rocky, (since the first one) to go into grave character detail.. I learned so much more about Rocky then I ever expected. And I am a die-hard Rocky fan!!! To see Rocky as a father figure, and watch his character throughout the movie without his wife, was simply amazing..Also the speech he gave, when he attempted to get his boxing license was amazing!! and the one he gave Paulie, about ""still having something in the basement"" and the one he gave his son about ""it ain't how hard you hit"" were not only Oscar worthy, but just completely moving, and compelling.. it was the most ""humanesque"" rocky I've seen since the first.. however it out did that character by leaps and bounds.I disagree very much with the previous comment.. I think the beginning of the movie was incredible, and absolutely important. It gave an in depth insight into just how great Adraian's death effected Rocky, and Paulie.. PS (I think Paulie played an outstanding role, and honestly should be considered for best supporting actor!)The only thing I feel this movie lacked compared to all the others is the fight scene, although it was the best one yet, as for as being the most realistic.. was a little shorter then I had hoped.. other then that it's an instant classic, 10 out of 10 stars!! worth seeing more then once!!",Rocky Balboa
661,FLVRTM,"Rocky Balboa is a must-see for any fan of the original, as the Italian Stallion truly ends the series in a defining, remarkable, and new way.",7,22 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa comes out of retirement to get into the ring for one last final match -- Can you get more clichéd than this? But Sylvester Stallone, the Italian Stallion, has managed to do it, yet again. And without speaking too soon, admittedly, the Rocky series has taken a downhill course through every additional film. But this newest, and reportedly final, addition to the series has done something very, very right.Hammering that nail in the coffin of the Rocky series may come to mind as the only possible thing that Stallone could have done with his new Rocky Balboa; but putting all jabs aside, Stallone, who both wrote and directed, managed to bring the greatest addition to the series since the original. For the better, Stallone also managed to ""trick the books"" with his storyline and twists by bringing something very different in terms of feeling and flow versus the majority of his earlier films.Family, romance, nostalgia, violence. Oh but nostalgia! If there were any films of recent memory that provoked more nostalgia than Rocky Balboa, please speak up! I am proud to say that the original theme song lives on and the upbeat-style borrows heavily from the predecessors. One cannot help but get excited when the theme sirens throughout the cinema and the crowd (of theater patrons) stand up and chant along.The psychology of the release of Rocky Balboa, though most likely not premeditated, is quite brilliant. The original generations that dwelled on the first few films are old enough to hold said films in distant memory, possibly even in the brightest of positive lights. The younger generations may still be caught having seen the originals or having only heard of them. Surely Rocky is one of the better additions to the greatest of boxing films, and surely Rocky has stylistically defined the genre itself, but for both those who have not seen any of the originals and for those who have, Rocky Balboa ends the series with the perfect mixture of both past and present.Plagued with fans on all ends of the spectrum, Rocky Balboa and his son, now grown up, are living out the consequences of the ""early years."" Autograph signings and shout-outs are a common occurrence, and even Rocky himself takes to telling stories in his own hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant. The straightforward story takes a turn when Rocky starts to feel his age and ponders about the possibility of getting back into the ring.Sylvester Stallone dreams of flashbacks. Throughout much of the film, you are exposed to flashbacks, among other things. Additional references to the earlier films are made in the introduction of a romance stigma, which also feeds off of nostalgia (the characters are all back-referenced). Other familiar faces also include Burt Young, back as the ultimate trainer and coach, Paulie. Both Young and Stallone, however, exhibit a peculiar chemistry, almost too-perfect -- Which leads me to point out that Rocky Balboa should not only be classified as a character drama, for its portrayal of retired-and-famed boxer Rocky Balboa, but also as a comedic drama! In this ending of the ""Rocky Saga,"" the punchlines are worth writing down, and they provide a very pleasant backdrop for the mostly dramatic and even more lax fight-intensive plot; even I find myself tempted in reciting a few on a day-to-day basis. The comedic aspect ties perfectly to the nostalgia, for which this latest arrival owes tribute to the predecessors, as many of the jokes are both references and quick pokes at the past and present.But in the end, the final laugh may be shared not by the pesky moviegoers who unjustly write-off Rocky Balboa, but by Sylvester Stallone and his production team. Rocky Balboa is a must-see for any fan of the original, as the Italian Stallion truly ends the series in a defining, remarkable, and new way.",Rocky Balboa

It looked like a sequel to a dead franchise, but it was quite on the ball.Its about the norm...pensioner Rocky Balboa steps back into the ring and fights....and wants the championship.So watch it...It's pretty good for a rocky movie, but overall a helpless remake. The film has good cgi computer graphics and stunts but stallone is a bit old for it..he needs a long break...maybe a death one. so if ur a rocky fan..by all means watch it..but if ur not then avoid.

A perfect capstone, it captures the themes and emotions that all 5 movies did on their own. With a 21st century touch, I was filled with emotion from the start and couldn't keep the tears out of my eyes.If I may invoke the Limbaugh echo syndrome, this movie taught us what real men are, what the American male should be. This was cap stoned by the little touches in the movie, and especially at the end when Rocky didn't stick around for the decision.The supporting characters were amazing. Burt Young added a great element especially. This is a movie done right...it must be seen.Congratulations Sly, you outdid yourself.",Rocky Balboa

It will touch your heart!,10,24 December 2006,"A lot of people may be afraid to spend money on this film because of the bomb that ""Rocky V"" was. I was a bit skeptical at first of a new Rocky movie, but I put my cash down for this film and was not disappointed at all. I thought Stallone's age would be a problem for this film, but while I was watching the question of age never came to mind. The underdog story and watching Rocky slowly return to boxing form come to the forefront of the film and I was so engrossed that I didn't care how old Sly was. The acting is decent, but then again Rocky movies are not known for their superb acting. The story is very heartfelt and echoes the original ""Rocky"". So, if you are skeptical about putting your money down for this film, forget everything and just take a risk. You will NOT be disappointed.",Rocky Balboa

Stallone has called it a love letter to Rocky fans and it truly is. I can't wait to see it again. The audience I saw it with clapped and cheered at all the right moments. I haven't had this much fun at a movie in ages. This is a rare anticipated film that lived up to the hype for me. I am too often disappointed in films that should be better than the final product. Technically, the film is amazing. The fight scenes, video and real, feel authentic. The editing is great. There are several muted almost hidden, images that will reverberate with fans of the earlier films. This film has real heart like the first one. I hope it makes money because it is a quality project. Don't let your prejudices against Rocky V or Stallone in general deprive you of the pleasure of this inspiring film.Thank you Stallone for a great holiday gift to movie fans!",Rocky Balboa
666,imjustatroll,A Dear Friend Returns,10,12 February 2007,"I went to see Rocky VI expecting to laugh, Stallone at age 60 expected me to believe that he could put on a pair of trunks and fight another super-man of an opponent. I was wrong, on the one in a million chance that someone who knows Sly is reading this, pass on both my apologies for doubting him and my heartiest congratulations for turning in one of the greatest movies of the last decade. When we last saw Rocky, he was down on his luck. He'd lost everything he'd worked so hard to get, all the money, all the cars, the big house, the cars, and seemingly the respect of the general public, all of it taken away by some bad financial decisions of Uncle Pauly. His attempt to break out of the mire of the fade-out that most athletes have by training an up and comer backfired and led to a fight with the young lion, and in the process he nearly lost his family. But through it all Rocky still had heart, he managed to get his priorities straight, and save his relationship with his sun. The intervening decade and a half have had their ups and downs. Rocky Jr. (real name Robert) has graduated college and is working for a business firm, Adrian has died of ""woman cancer"", in her memory Rocky has opened a restaurant named ""Adrians"" and business is doing well. He is quietly growing old, trying to keep in touch with his son, still grieving for his wife, and enjoying a certain level of nostalgic respect from the public who like to get pictures, autographs, and to hear his stories of the glory days. But Rocky's life is missing a few things, as his son grows into a man of his own right, he pulls away from his father. All Rocky has anymore is the need to love and be loved, and Rocky Jr. isn't giving it to his father. Enter ""Little Marie"", the last time we saw her was in the first film as a street-wise girl on the path to being another lump of gutter trash. The years have been up and down for her too, she and Rocky become friends. He needs the project, and the warmth that comes from caring about someone, so they become friends, he does for her and her son like they are his own blood. In helping to give them a better life, he feels better about himself. It seems as though the glory days are still over though, and Rocky will quietly go out, until a computer simulated fight pits Rocky against the reigning champ, and it is predicted that Rocky will win. That gets people talking, and it makes Rocky wonder, maybe he isn't completely out of it yet. Life is tough, but we don't have to let it cripple us. Rocky is challenged to a fight, and against all odds and the doubts of everyone who knows him, he proves that there is no such thing as ""too old"", and that the biggest muscle of all is the heart. Here we have the Rocky movie that had to be made. Rocky was never supposed to end on a sour note, and the majority of Rocky V was sour. Two generations have grown up on Rocky, he was the role model of role models, he was honest, he showed love and respect to everyone he ever met, and proved that hard work will pay off. He became a friend, an older brother, a father, and an icon. Going into Rocky Balboa, and seeing that Stallone and everyone else were taking it seriously creates such a flood of emotion. My friend, my idol came back for another round, and I am inspired. The writing is excellent, after the last two entries just coasted on ""Yo Adrians"" and stereotypical street accents. The acting is great from all the principals. Although shot on a very low studio budget, it doesn't show, the film is full of great cameos (look for Mike Tyson) and authentic location shots. Never does it look like corners were cut, and it's clear that everyone gave their all to go just one more round.",Rocky Balboa
667,timberstorm,Not as good as the original. . .BETTER than the original!,8,20 December 2006,"I got to see this movie today. Even though I've only been a Rocky fan for the past five years, I feel as if I've been waiting fifteen years for this movie.The film revisits the former champion, who is living a fairly quiet life in the old neighborhood, while grieving each and every day for his beloved wife Adrian who died four years earlier. Rocky is, as his ever-witty brother-in-law Paulie states ""living backwards"", something Paulie is not willing to do. Rocky's son is distant, while not ignoring his father. Stallone portrays the conflicted Rocky with incredible prowess and class, far exceeding even his brilliant acting in the other films. Meanwhile, the current champion Mason Dixon is literally booed out of rings due to the easiness of his victory, When ESPN broadcasts a simulated fight between the two, Rocky is awed into getting back into the ring, just to kill the ""beast"", the grief he has inside. Stallone shows a level of heart in portraying Rocky that was even absent in the first two films, especially in the scenes with the Boxing Commission and Robert. Rocky;s inner struggle is brought to light in a way we never understood before, beneath the obvious bits of humor thrown in, which really reconnect us with an old friend. It all makes you feel good, and it's all very familiar. Rather than simply make Rocky an ideal or inspiration like he did in Rocky I, Stallone, along with his supporting cast, has really made us find a piece of Rocky within each of us. Somewhere in there, all of us still have ""some stuff left in the basement."" The movie is far from flawless. The pacing was off at times, as the movie starts very comfortably, and then accelerates at the end. There is hardly any re-introduction of the character of Duke, which bothered me because if there had been any focus on the relationship between Rocky and Duke, this might have been even more emotional. Duke and Steps are just sort of tossed in, not contributing anything substantial to the power of the film. Perhaps the training montage was too short, but it still left you gasping for air, wanting to go run up some steps. Perhaps the extremely well-choreographed fight was too short, but you can't help but feel good about the flashbacks of Clubber, Drago, Adrian and Mickey, remembering ""the good old days."" When Rocky went down near the end, I wanted to get out of my seat and scream ""get up you son of a bitch cuz Mickey loves ya."" This movie makes you feel good, something that very few Hollywood movies can say they do in this day in age. Despite its flaws, ""Rocky Balboa"" leaves fans and non-fans, old and young, feeling inspired, and re-invigorated,in a way that even the first movie didn't do as you stand up to the glorious end credits and give the greatest underdog of all time one last ""hurrah."" 8 or 8.5 out of 10.",Rocky Balboa
668,fallen_one_9,Nice closure,10,2 February 2007,"It has been a long time that a movie got to me but this one did. How true were rocky's words: Nothing is going to hit harder than life, ... . In the end when they're both fighting. I was acting along, hoping that Rocky would hit Dixon K.O. It's just such a fitting end to a wonderful series of movies which are a part of movie history just like the godfather and more. Nice acting, nice story and especially the music that sucked you into the story and to feel along with Rocko. Some may find this movie far to emotional but it's not only the end of Rocky for us but also the end of Rocky for Stallone which is proved in so many ways throughout the movie. You can tell that Stallone made his peace with this movie and can finally let go now. Great job Rocko",Rocky Balboa

And that's what making films is all about. Telling a great story in motion pictures with excellent dialogs. This story of Rocky Balboa is thin. So thin, that it absolutely not worth telling to anybody, let alone make a movie of it. But they did (WHY for crying out lout). We end up with movie that tells a pathetic sentimental no-one-wants-hear-story about a guy who used to fight, stops ans start again. The dialogs in the movie are horrible; the plot is terrible; and these two things combined make everything very NOT credible. The only reason for not scoring it a 1 is that the acting is not too bad the scenery is nice to look at.DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE. IT IS EVEN WORSE THAN ROCKY5",Rocky Balboa

It made me wanna go pump some iron or kick somebody's ass. If you are a fan of Rocky you'll love this final flick. It was slow going but it was gripping the slow pace was perfect. Adrian had to be gone i felt that from the very beginning of the movie cause she would'not have let him fight.When he was fighting Dixon and you heard the Mick and Adrian man it was a rush and when he almost went down and he said something along the lines of ""not how hard you get hit but keep going forward "" something like that just an intense feeling i thought he was gonna knock Dixon out.The draw was predictable but it would have been awesome if he ko'd him .",Rocky Balboa
671,RogerMalcolm,Got to love Rocky,10,23 December 2006,I feel that Sly did an amazing job with this movie. He put so much emotion and power into it. Maybe I just like the Rocky movies too much. It's just he really brought this story back to the beginning of Rocky where you can feel it inside and really feel for the character and relate to the story. I was really looking forward to this movie and kind of felt that he wouldn't be making another film unless he planned on making it better than the last at least. And I feel he does by far make a better movie than Rocky V. I also feel that you need to watch all the others to get the feeling of the legacy he has and to not only understand but feel the story. Great job Sly!,Rocky Balboa
672,the-rahmeister,A great exit.,9,22 December 2006,"I really loved this film, it was emotional and moving...an inspirational piece of cinema, something movies these days don't do. Stallone has outdone himself with this, it's up there with the the original Rocky. using some of the old soundtrack and images just made it that more special. And the ending was brilliant, the fact that winning is not everything and that it's ""not about hard you can hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward"". This is a movie to show to someone if they doubts in their life and don't know what to do, it's not just about the boxing, it's more about the heart. And this is one of the year's best films.",Rocky Balboa
673,coleal2,"Truth, Strength and Myth",10,23 December 2006,"In a media that is obsessed with youth, where ""fashion"" is obsolete after months instead of years, and people are considered old by 40 and ancient by 50, ""Rocky Balboa"" has a great deal to teach. This movie is a blessing to people of all ages. Despite the tasteless jokes about celluloid and all the typical elder-bashing that America's entertainment industry devours like some putrid dish, I'm pleased to say that Stallone has returned to the silver screen with incredible grace. Yes, there are the endless one liners throughout the film, but they are words forged through blood, sweat and years.Though I am by no means a fan of boxing or fighting, I am a fan of respecting the dignity of people. Unfortunately, respect in this ignorant world is often earned and not immediately conveyed. We have a lot of growing up to do as a society. Our dreams do not perish by the age of 40, and we should not slip gently into that good night, as though all our personal worth is something that has passed. The greatest accomplishment of ""Rocky Balboa"" is to give younger people the lens to view their elders in a greater light of wisdom, compassion...and STRENGTH.",Rocky Balboa
674,benbigwig-1,Faithful to the spirit of the series,9,21 December 2006,"""Graceful aging"" is the modus operandi for Racky Balboa, the final installment of the Rocky legacy. Not only has Rocky himself aged gracefully, remained a gentleman yet having never lost the fighting spirit, but Sly Stallone has shown there was indeed more of Rocky's story to be told. The Rocky series deserved to go out in the ring, and any bad taste left by Rocky V is thankfully washed away in this film.In Rocky Balboa, we join the champ in his waning years, tending a restaurant named after his late wife, trying desperately to connect with his distant son, and, in many ways, still stuck in the past. When a computer simulated fight predicts that Rocky in his 1970s prime would defeat current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, Rocky decides he has one more fight left in him.The Rocky series has always been best as a series of inspirational works. The underdog story of the first told us that anyone has a shot at greatness. Rocky Balboa reminds us that we must be true to ourselves, to do what we believe to be right despite what others might tell us. The purity of that inspirational message carries the film. Rocky remains a hero for all of us, one of those few examples of what is best in all of us. He does good things for others because it's right, not because he will get some profit from it. Even in his fight with Mason, he gives the heavyweight champ a ""gift"" of dignity and challenge.Rocky Balboa loses one star for Bill Conti's repetitive score, but that's all. On the whole this is a terrific heartwarming film. It will bring back great memories of the previous films while also carving its own well-deserved niche in the series. It's the best of the new and the old.",Rocky Balboa
675,bordaz,Wow...terrible Rocky film!,4,19 August 2007,"I understand that Sylvester Stallone missed this character, and really wanted a closure to the saga that he felt he didn't have with Rocky V seventeen years ago. For an actor like him, the chance to keep playing the one character he was made for will always be tempting. However, Rocky Balboa was not the resolution to this series that, in my opinion, was already complete. The great feature of the previous Rocky films was the element of doubt. The original film inspired people because a bum from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa, was given the chance to become world heavyweight champion by Apollo Creed, and he very nearly succeeded. In Rocky's II, III, and IV, Rocky had to battle not only increasingly superior fighters, but the temptations to pursue another way of life and to ease up and bask in his fame. More importantly, he also had to deal, in a compelling way, with his own fears and doubts about his actual ability. When I watched each Rocky film for the first time - and I have seen them all quite a few times - I always had to wonder if Rocky was really going to make it. Apollo Creed was too accomplished, or too driven; Clubber Lang was too strong, and Rocky too emotionally weak; Ivan Drago was a frightening physical freak who should have put Rocky in his grave in two rounds. Yet because the story succeeded in making us doubt, the greatness of Rocky's victory was so much sweeterThis film had none of that. Mason Dixon is a presented as a half-hearted champion who has never been tested (yeah, what a great challenge), and Rocky is fully fit after two minutes of a training montage. No questions to be answered, no issues within Rocky to deal with, just ""here we go again"" as a determined Rocky predictably pushes the champion to the limit. There's just nothing new here, no new wrinkle to make the story interesting, to make us wonder if Rocky is really going to make it! And the characters! Bereft of three of the original main characters, this film brought in some new ones - Marie, Steps, a totally different Rocky Jr. - but then did almost nothing to shine light on who they were - especially Steps. Heck, even Marie's ""Rah-rah"" speech in the van is an exact paraphrase of Adrian's speech to a frustrated Balboa in the third movie on the LA beach - and that with much less elegance. The series should have ended with Rocky V",Rocky Balboa
676,Sniipe,2nd worse rocky,6,25 January 2007,"Unfortunately there was a few things for me that let this film down. First of all, The poor sound on the fight screens. Its probably a case of it being filmed live then they had to do voice overs. Another thing with the fight scenes is that the close ups looked too fast and awkward... switching angles very quickly to cover it up. Next, I didn't understand the idea behind steps and the dog... next, I thought the son was pretty good until the fight scenes. Overall, I don't know what I was really hoping for in this film. I did enjoy it but thought it lacked. I loved the scene in the gym when he was training but found that it was too short. I thought that this film was better than the last one but does not rank as high as the other Rocky films. I am looking forward to his next film, Rambo :)",Rocky Balboa
677,daltonandsusan,Wow...Stallone did it!!,10,22 December 2006,"I must say that when I heard about this film, I was not only extremely skeptical but upset as well. Rocky Balboa is not just a film character, he is an icon of American cinema. He represents the common man in a very emotional and sincere way and to tinker with that is to risk destroying a bit of that character. Unfortunately, Stallone did nearly unrepairable damage to the character with the introduction of the fifth installment of the series. An unfitting end to one of the greatest prize fighters to grace the silver screen, but, wait a minute.... 16 years later.....Rocky's coming back for one more fight?? At Stallones age, that seemed an impossible feat, but maybe, just maybe he could pull it off, and pull it off he did.Just like the best installments of the series, Stallone weaves a gritty, emotionally charged human story around a heart pumping, adrenaline rushing training montage and finally a crowd rousing fight sequence. Not only did I find myself enjoying this film, I was cheering from the audience when Rocky floored the champ with a flurry of body shots. I was pumping my fist in the air every time Rocky connected with Dixon's jaw, sending shock wave's, not only through Dixon on screen, but through the theater audience as well. This movie accomplished what most found impossible- it brought the Balboa character back to stunning glory, leaving the audience in a state of breathless wonder and joy, knowing that this beloved character has a fitting end to his incredible story. Thirty years after the south paw from Philly was first introduced to audiences around the world, we get to see him bow out gracefully. Going toe to toe one last time and leaving everything, or the ""beast"" as he calls it, in the ring. I can't imagine a better send off for the Italian Stallion than that.This movie is not only a must-see for any Rocky fan, it is a must-see film period. It instill's the same feelings that I got watching the original for the first time. You can't help but cheer for Rocky, even when his heart and determination seem to be outweighing his reason and common-sense. I give this movie my sincerest endorsement. Go see it, you won't be disappointed.",Rocky Balboa
678,mike-2923,DO NOT PAY FOR THIS MOVIE!!!! Wait for cable.,5,27 December 2006,"I honestly do not see what this 8-10 votes are about, this people are insane.Jokes are beyond cornie! Story makes no damn sense! Movie effects are horrible, the boxing match is much less believable then the old fights.The sad part is they way the story goes, I think there will be another Rocky, especially if this makes money because it looks like it cost about $1000 to make.The interesting part about this movies is it makes you think WHAT'S next and what's next is rocky talking about the past, all movie long, ""I REMEMBER"" blah blah blah",Rocky Balboa
679,brianthomas,cleaning out the basement can sometimes be a really enjoyable thing.,8,20 December 2006,"it was exactly what i thought it would be and i still shed a soft tear at the end. it was inspiring, it was sincere, it was cheesy, it was nostalgic, IT WAS ROCKY! i had zero apprehensions going into this because i just knew that sly wouldn't let us down and he certainly didn't. who cares if sly is 60 and who cares if the film is completely unrealistic. it was about sticking it out there in life to get it chopped off and having the balls to take a beating for the sake of living a dream. in a time when films so often rely upon special effects, sex appeal or outrageousness as their motive to entertain this film relies simply upon the audience's ability to sit back relax and enjoy riding shotgun while a guy lives one last trip through the ring. sly's? rocky's? who cares. it was awesome and anyone who liked the first one and hated the 5th one needs to revisit the character in this one, the final one. yo rocky, thanks!",Rocky Balboa
680,supersweet-1,Rocky - the latest copy,1,4 January 2007,"This movie is scary and sad in many ways, i actually wish i had never seen this. I'm born in the seventies and have old memories, good ones too, from this series of films, and now these memories came to look more like nightmares, you got away with these directing skills 30 years ago, not today. As for the acting, i'm guessing Stallone is getting old, but so is Anthony Hopkins And Sean Connery. Comments seen like ""as good as"" makes me wounder... If you are going to watch this, don't hope for nothing else then Deja Vu leaving. I'm fed up with nationalistic crap like this, just trying to milk a few buck out of a genre already filled with masterpieces, watch Cinderella man or Million dollar baby instead.",Rocky Balboa
681,rbuonomo27,how is this movie getting such rave reviews?,3,22 December 2006,after all the great reviews i expected some great movie...i didn't see a great movie... better than 5 but nothing great1st of all the 1st hour or so was so slow and boring. his speech to the commission almost had me laughing out loud.also wasn't he all broke and out of money and in rocky 5? so how does he own a restaurant now?the ending was so predictable.. you knew he wasn't gonna get KO'd you knew he wasn't gonna win . so the ending was gonna be a decision loss... (also with all the knockdowns how was the scoring 95-94?) the ending of it was good though the way he left the ring to cheers and it kinda ended the whole thingthe last 40 minutes was pretty good. good fight if you could suspend belief that tarver wouldn't just beat the living hell out of himalso why were people in bars cheering the computer fight?Paulie had some funny lines i cant decide if i really hated it or just kinda didn't care for it a little or maybe i was expecting too much from it,Rocky Balboa
682,pontix13,Nice ending to the Rocky series........,8,22 March 2007,"I think this film is the best of all Rocky's because I think it had a stronger scenario and it show's all the sides of the Rocky character as a boxer,husband,father,friend e.t.c. Comparing it to the other 5 films that where almost the same just the ""bad guy"" would change I think it's a more completed film.I'm not saying that the other films are not good , they are really good for their time all of them, besides rocky 5 ,that I think after rocky 4 they should have made rocky balboa and never had made rocky 5.Anyway Rocky Balboa is very good film to see ,and it ends in a sad nice way ...........................",Rocky Balboa
683,LouManEntertainment,A fantastic conclusion to the Rocky Saga!!!,10,19 January 2007,"I saw this film at my local cinema and what can I say, this is a fantastic Rocky movie. I had been waiting for this too come out for about 4 years so I was more then ready for it to come out. It is a truly outstanding film which will be appreciated by about everyone. The training montage was great, the music was great, the fight was great and so was everything else. All people that doubted that he could comeback as Rocky, will be in for a real surprise as the old Rocky we all love is still there. This is definitely one of the best Rocky movies out there just like the original. Most of all, this is an outstanding film that will be loved by all people especially Rocky fans. 10/10 AMAZING!!!",Rocky Balboa
684,geezeratwork,I've been waiting 17 years for this,10,25 January 2007,"There are many people who will say ""This film sucks"" and ""Sly is too old"" but they do not understand the Rocky saga. This film is a MUST for any rocky fan. for those who grew up watching Rocky and that have been let down by Rocky V. Balboa wraps up the story and I left the Cinema without the bitter taste of Rocky V that I've had for 17 years.A lot of the people who don't like this film tend to expect 90 minutes of boxing, lets not forget this is the 6th Rocky movie, the story focuses more on Balboa than the fight, Sly looked great for his age. The fight was not the longest but by far the best of all the movies. Sly was born to play Rocky and does so perfectly, Paulie added humour with many funny lines. If you have not seen Rocky 1-5 you may not appreciate it as much has someone who has. Thanks Sly for finishing a great story. Fantastic movie, 10/10",Rocky Balboa
685,mstodge,Rocky Rests In piece,8,23 December 2006,"Having been a fan of rocky since it began in 1976 and always waiting in anticipation for the next installment like a child waiting for Santa, i'd like to think i know a bit about the rocky franchise. When rocky V came out and it was stated that this would be the last Rocky movie, i was very disappointed. It didn't do justice to Rocky himself and to the previous movies. It left a lot of questions unanswered and seemed to just stop dead in some empty space. With Rocky Balboa though it answers all those questions and more. Watching the movie it does at times tug on your heart strings, it's a roller coaster ride of emotion watching rocky go through these emotions himself and not knowing how best to deal with them. (Myself not having a father, Rocky was the role model i grew up with and when watching him go through these troubles and not knowing how to deal with them allows me to in some way relate) I think this is the best acting Stallone has done since First Blood, YES first blood, the scene were he is cornered and crying describing the Vietnam war. I like to think I'm a tough guy, but watching this did make me cry. The reason being that Rocky is going through a rough time, he knows this will be his last shot at glory(for Rocky at proving himself as a fighter and for Stallone to prove himself to those doubters as a fine actor) I now await the next Rambo along with other movies Stallone will be getting thrown at him.",Rocky Balboa
686,suavegroover,Not just for Rocky fans,10,23 February 2007,"Okay, I'm a huge Rocky fan and it's difficult to be totally objective about this film; however, I do think this is a film anyone can enjoy. I'm not only a huge Rocky fan, but a film buff in general. As much I as I love the series, there is no way that any of the sequels would make my top 100 - and yes i have a top 100.This film has what the sequels cry out for, realism. While the realistic moments are quiet and subtle, this is the way they should be. That may turn off fans of the sequels. Fans during the screening I went to a few days ago said, ""where is 'Eye of the Tiger?'"" So if shallow and fast is what you want, this is not the film for you. Rocky and Paulie have matured so much in this film, their aging is spot on and that's the core of this film. It's a drama about aging, and a fine one at that. It doesn't shirk away from the potshots many take at someone past their best. It's easy to write off this film before seeing it, but it truly is a credible piece of cinema.Sylvester Stallone gives a wonderful performance and his direction has also matured. No more of those clumsy zooms or still into cross fade shots from the sequels. Burt Young is, however, the highlight. I think he's been robbed of a supporting Oscar nomination here, this is his finest work. The script is poignant and it certainly has some funny lines too.Th fight scene has some thrilling and nicely stylised moments, as well as a realism that we haven't seen in a Rocky movie for a long time. This movie is more than the fight scene, it's a fantastic nostalgic trip with a theme that is relevant and resonant.",Rocky Balboa
687,metbub,better than expected,8,12 December 2006,"I saw this film at a screening last week and was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly I did not have high expectations but I found the film to be loyal to its original characters and actually quite heart-warming. If you get over the whole concept of Rocky being 60, fighting a young champ, you will also find this film entertaining. The way the film deals with his grief over the loss of Adrian, the estrangement from his son, and the expectations from the world around him, who stills thinks he is the reigning champ are very delicately portrayed. My friend and I also got so involved in the film that we found ourselves ducking for the punches in the fight scenes. All in all, a good solid film.",Rocky Balboa
688,leechapman,An incredibly emotional return,10,21 January 2007,"I loved Rocky Balboa and spent almost half of it fighting back tears. I have no idea quite how this film managed to get to me the way it did, but it left me awestruck and thoroughly blown away. A wonderful central performance from Sly left my wife and I reeling and I have no shame in admitting that I couldn't speak for a good twenty minutes after the film had finished. Also, Sylvester's direction deserves a mention; creative, fluid, and rich with subtle invention - he is seriously undervalued in this area. Go see it. If you're a fan of the original Rocky, this is the perfect bookend. Seriously, believe the hype. A deeply affecting character piece with real heart.",Rocky Balboa
689,Richard_Sargeant,"Great film, Can't believe he actually made it!",10,29 May 2007,"So. OK. Where to start? This film is GREAT! I have already watched it 5 times, and will continue to do so. The film is well acted especially Stallone, who I think gives an awe inspiring performance - close to what he gave in 1976 for the original. The music by Bill Conti of course is pitch perfect creating the right feel and emotion.After the lame Rocky V (which is quite painful to watch) this is a great ending to the series and a real treat for Rocky fans. I only wish it was a little longer although Stallone does mention on the DVD that he will be releasing a Directors Cut at some point. Anyway if you have not seen this film yet and you are a Rocky fan this is must!!!",Rocky Balboa
690,life_m2000,Rocky Balboa still at the top of his game.,10,21 January 2007,"Rocky comes full circle and ends the series in style. Rocky Balboa stands shoulder with the first Rocky which was made back in 1976 over thirty years ago!To anyone that has only seen the first Rocky film there is no need to see parts 2-5 as Rocky and Rocky Balboa fit better with each other than the other films in the series. In Rocky Balboa Stallone conjures up that inspirational feeling once again and you just can't help yourself but feel like a child watching Rocky for the first time.Overall this is an easy, enjoyable and still inspirational movie, well worth a watch!!",Rocky Balboa
691,dino06,have you seen it?,8,20 December 2006,"it definitely fits right in with the other 5 .... he goes out exactly how he went in ... the movie is very well done, they give you a nice dose of nostalgia as well as give you some new things to think about... the only quarrel i have with this movie was that the fight only lasted for like 10 minutes total... it was over before it started ... i was disappointed about that but overall i definitely enjoyed it and recommend it to any rocky advocate... basically i could go on forever but i don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet because that would be a crime... so just pay the damn $8 and watch it .. its worth it you cheap bastards ...",Rocky Balboa
692,mike_mich29303,Awesome Movie,10,19 December 2006,"A truly great movie. I went to see the sneak preview last night. I wont give anything away. The story rates up with the first Rocky. While I have read other comments and noticed the complaint about the lack of a top flight soundtrack, I believe that the movie did not need one. It was also nice to go to a movie that delivered in under 2 hours. Rocky Balboa wasted no unnecessary screen time with side stories and really left no opening for a Rocky Balboa 2. The crowd was into the movie from start to finish. Stallone should get credit for writing in Oscar consideration, although in this day and age it his highly unlikely that will happen. If you get a chance to see it, DO. I will be seeing it again this weekend.",Rocky Balboa

But it really didn't matter at the end of the film Rocky won his own personal fight - i swear at the end of the movie as rocky left the ring i was just thinking why doesn't the ring announcer shut up already, it's irrelevant !! Anyways i walked out of that theatre with a big big smile on my face thinking if i bumped into Sylvester Stallone in the foyer right now i would take him by the hand and just say ""Thank you""...The perfect way to end the story of a legend When you usually go the the theatre you know what you're gonna get, and boy was i wrong, so wrong! Mr Stallone - Thank you x",Rocky Balboa
694,ben-byrne,a return to form for the ageing Stallone,8,31 January 2007,"The real Rocky returns in the sixth installment of the series, whereas Rocky 2-5 appear to have been produced purely for economical reasons, Rocky Balboa recreates the working class passion of the Oscar winning original. Once again we find Rocky in a time of his life where he feels he has something to prove to the world, obviously not content with the life he has lead, he strives for one last shot at glory; this is perhaps reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone himself, whose career has faultered in recent years but he has now completed a fitting obituary to the classic Hollywood career. In this film we see a return to the portrayal of human retaliation which is apparent in the first film, however,in the first Rocky, where the title character battles against the odds of being an unknown against the popular champion Apollo Creed, in Rocky Balboa, the established hero of the films battles against the timeless angst of ageing and loss making this film both enjoyable and poignant",Rocky Balboa
695,simbo94,Rocky Balboa is what it is,8,20 December 2006,"As a fan of this series, this movie does justice to the wrong made by the fifth installment. The movie hits home, heading back to what made this series so special in the first place. Plus, there are some decent cameos for the boxing public who enjoy the sport. A good family movie for those interested. If you are not a fan of the series, you should probably stay away. You only come away with critical comments and may even feel slightly jaded. The movie is what it is. It's the rightful ending to a great series that inspired a nation. I have always enjoyed the character of Paulie Panini and he does not disappoint with some classic one-liners.

Well it would've probably been a bad movie if it was called Rocky 6, but Rocky Balboa made me think hey ! it's Rocky ! and that's all. It wasn't at all the bad movie I thought it would be.This movie made Rocky wiser, of course older, but still kicking. It was good to see a somewhat different set of values that thrive Rocky to go on. The ending I enjoyed a lot, it might be different than most of you think, but I doubt it makes the movie bad, on the contrary it makes it unique.I wasn't a Rocky fan, but I enjoyed the movie a lot. I recommend it to anyone. I only gave it a 9 because I didn't like something about it - but no spoilers from me !",Rocky Balboa
697,hovster_13,Better Than Most,8,22 December 2006,"I watch Rocky for Rocky. Not for the blood, sweat, and tears. Nor for the soundtrack that brings back fond memories, although that is a great touch. Rocky is my favorite character of any film of all time, and I absolutely love this series of films. This film is a much more fitting end to the series than was Rocky V, although Rocky V was still a great film in my opinion. His character is always tested, and he comes through with the heart of a champion and a general understanding of goodwill to all. Unlike most Rocky fans, I love the story more than the action. I appreciate all movies from that regard. If a great story is told and a strong message can be taken from it, then a film has the potential to be great. First I will give my order of favorite Rocky movies from this measure: 1, 2, Rocky Balboa, 5, 4, and 3 comes in last. This goes against the majority, as 4 is near the top for most it seems. I appreciate the story, and I admire the character of Rocky. The first two set the story of an insignificant person with a lot of heart doing something great not for glory and not for riches, but to prove his worth to himself. Three and four fall away from that and become just action movies with the characters, but little of that character value of the character of Rocky Balboa. Rocky V has the struggle of going back to insignificance, and showing the difference between Rocky's heart on less talent and less heart and more talent from other fighters. That movie brings the character of Rocky back, and Rocky Balboa does not disappoint. He is now in his upper 50's, and is wiser for it. He is significant in his world and wants/needs one more shot to prove his worth to himself. It brings back the desire to be significant and to prove one's worth. He does it through wisdom, leadership, caring of those around him, and the heart that made the original so significant a film.",Rocky Balboa
698,optobob,perfect ending,8,28 December 2006,"I won't give away the ending of the bout but if you have seen all of the other Rocky's, especially the first, this was the perfect ending. As for the rest of the movie, it was very good. Stallone had to walk the line between too much story about the son and the girl and whatever else and not enough. He goes on the side of not getting too deep into his son's story which might bother some but I'm O.K. with that. He is also vague about his age which was smart. There are some plot holes but there have been throughout the series just as there are in most movie series. As a long time Rocky fan, I liked it and thought it finished up the series very well.",Rocky Balboa
699,edmundodfp,Rocky is the best,10,24 February 2007,"Rocky Balboa is an excellent film. It is not better that the first one, but it is, with certainty, as better of the series. It is impressive. The script was very good and Stallone better made its performance of the career since the second film of the series. Rocky now is a man who fights does not stop knocking down adversaries, but yes to continue its life without being forgotten and to prove for sí proper that still it is capable to obtain what wants. Without vision of future, living only of passed it needs to fight of new obtaining to free its person of a torment obtained for the death of loved its. Moreover, the glory of the past does not mean more nothing for other people, this still more leaves disappointed Rocky. It fights not to be forgotten and to prove that while something total was not finished, he is not possible to live carried through.

Although it is fictional, when your watching this last great Rocky, it will all feel real. This movie is all heart and it is a really emotional film. It has a good amount of flashbacks from past Rocky's and it uses some of the old elements from the films and puts them in here which not everyone will know, only the ones who have seen them all once or twice...ha ha! Sylvester Stallone gives a very heartfelt performance, besides Rocky number 1, probably his greatest ever and one of the greatest period. Burt Young as always delivers with a magnificent performance of Paulie. I hope this has helped you guys.

That could have been something beautiful... But it can't be, as the intervening money spinners can't be undone. However much this may upset die-hard-""I have the box set...I know my film... Don't mess with the formula""-fans, this movie isn't so much about what ""we"" want (""David and Goliath!"" they cry) but about what Stallone wants to tell us. The fact he didn't win the last fight is a blatant admission of his own mortality. A brave act, even if unconscious. Sadly though, it also so betrays signs of his artistic mortality.But will the big man himself admit the latter to himself, eh? We'll see.",Rocky Balboa

I definitely do not think it was better than Rocky or Rocky 2, however it deserves to stand next to them. I think it was by far much better than Rocky 3, Rocky 4, and Rocky 5.The characters of Rocky and Paulie were kept in line with the previous movies and they were enjoyable to see again. Stallone was also smart for incorporating the great songs from the prior Rocky movies, such as Take You Back, Eye of the Tiger and Gonna Fly Now. It was also nice to see that Rocky seems to have smartened up a bit in the years, with his witty comments and arguments. The movie also stayed true to the theme of all the other Rocky movies, which was to ""follow your heart"" and to ""get back up when you've been pushed down"".",Rocky Balboa

You must watch it go see it!!!I tell you it was the best Rocky in my view, having growing up watching Rocky I must say this makes the others with it priceless. It was so great that I actually dropped just a few tears at the end. I'm however still a man I must say I just had a sensitive moment, however at the end Rocky said a few words to Paulie that really is a powerful part of the movie and if you watch it carefully you will see what part I was talking about.

It's hard to believe, but the story line is believable, and Rocky maintains the respect, dignity, and values we've all grown to love. This movie could've easily been Rocky banging a much younger chick showing that he still ""had it"" but it didn't. I loved the fact that he called her ""Little Marie"" throughout the movie; there was potential for romance, but she was too young for him, and Adrian was still in his heart. My only complaint is that they could've found a dog that could keep up with him while running up the steps; it was painful to watch him drag the pooch up behind him!! I get the ""old dog with heart left in him"" reference, but please!! But that's a minor point...I'm already ready for the next one. :)",Rocky Balboa

A great example for young and old how to live life with heart and with dignity. Very unassuming movie. Matched up very well with Rocky I and Rocky II. Classy.Saw it with my older son, and we both liked it a lot. It was a family movie we both could understand, without the roar and blast of CGI and amplified special effects.Wish more movies were made like this!

706,falk25,rocky 1... too many maybe,5,23 December 2006,"I actually had gone into the viewing with reasonably high expectations, since there was some critical acclaim for this movie. In the end, I was disappointed, but because of the great legacy of the Rocky movies, I relieved my feeling of disappointment by the statement to my fellow movie goers that this was like a great band's ""farewell tour."" Rocky showed more of his compassionate side than ever before- the quintessential big hearted warrior who expects nothing from family and friends, but gives so much to everyone. He is truly in despair after the loss of his wife, and so much of the movie is dedicated to her memory (Rocky's restaurant is named after the late Mrs. Balboa). I enjoyed getting to know Rocky more, but I felt it was at the expense of the always anticipated training segment and fight. I didn't like the video graphics that were so prevalent during the fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon. I certainly felt this episode was better than the fifth, but it still falls far short of I and II. In spite of this, thank you to Sylvester Stallone for extending the experience of Rocky and giving the movie audience 6 episodes in 30 years!",Rocky Balboa
707,store183,I am devastated,10,4 December 2006,"Oh man I don't know where to start. Let me just give you my back-round and I know its a bit overused but I am a HUGE ROCKY FAN!!! I pretty much memorized the lines from every movie. My friends and I talk on the phone all the time and constantly use phrases from the movies that we love so much. Most people didn't like Rocky 5...but I did. I loved it. I've been such a huge rocky fan for so long and as most of you feel , I couldn't wait to see the movie. Born and raised in Detroit but now I live in Houston Texas so when my 3 buddies called me and let me know that back home their was a showing at the star theater I immediately purchased 4 tickets and hopped on the first plane to Detroit. I don't remember being this excited for anything. We purchased the VIP tickets and didn't get what was advertised..but who cares! All I wanted was to see the movie and maybe even get to shake Sly's hand. The passion of the crowd from the moment the movie started was amazing. Everyone including myself wanted to badly to see this movie. Most importantly it pretty much could have been mediocre and I would have still loved it. But with all of my heart I am sorry to say to all of you that this movie is a complete bust. I know how much static I will receive for posting this review. Heck it might even be taken off of this board. But here's the real story... The movie has a very slow start finding Rocky pretty much miserable with his life. he's surrounded by people in his life that are getting older and probably a little senile. Pauly, Spider Rico these guys are like whack jobs now. Its depressing, and sad and very slow paced. Allot of this film is also a stroll down memory lane. That you people must admit is a bit dull. We watched him as he walks back to the ice rink, 3 trips to Adrian's grave, the apartment in which they first hung out blah blah. You get my point. The whole time I'm thinking please sly pick up the pace. lets also make another thing clear this movie is a drama. Its very much in the shape of Rocky 1. But only the actors aren't up to par. I'm sorry. The character stepps, spider Rico very much so characters with no depth. Why even introduce them? The training montage. Come on guys how can you mess this up?? But the truth is..it was very short and didn't have anywhere near the heat of rocky 1, 2, 3 or 4! Not even close. And the fight was terrible! Yes it was I'm sorry very slow paced, didn't have the punch or drama that any other fight has. And the decision at the end??? Come on are you serious its a movie! You have to have a knockout! Rocky or Mason one of these guys has to win on a knockout. Lets be honest, sly can knockout drago and Mr. T and Apollo but he can't knockout Antonio, skinny as hell Tarver? Antonio Tarver was a HUGE disappointment. Not that he was a bad actor and its not that he was good either, but they didn't build him up enough! Remember Apollo in the first one oh my god then the second! He was flat out scary and mean as hell! I thought Rocky was gonna get killed in part 2! How about Mr. T??? How scary was he. I remember thinking about what a tough and crazy guy he was! Apollo saying you though I was tough this chump will kill you! That builds up a bad guy! And we all know about Drago ...he killed apollo the guy was so tough! But Mason. No heat. No intimidation at all! I'm sorry but he wasn't built up as a guy who was tough or impossible to beat and thats what a movie needs. The guy in Cinderella man was tougher! I'm sorry but am I wrong guys??? Please tell me! Also I don't remember Rocky ever smiling during the film! He never told one of his corny jokes or really acted like rocky does (shy, nieve slightly corny) The fight didn't have the heat, the training was way too short! Rocky looks old and I thought I could get past it but I couldn't. All of of people are gonna be upset and think I don't know what I'm saying. I'm no writer guys I'm just a fan. But I am a fan who was let down in every aspect and it hurts me deeply to tell the truth. Please forgive me for being honest. This has to be the toughest thing I have ever written.",Rocky Balboa
708,kungpowelvis,Much better than you realize,9,20 December 2006,"Rocky V never happened, and that is a good thing. Most people think this movie will be a joke because V was a joke, but for Rocky enthusiasts V never happened....never. This movie is good, the ploy of using tangential characters from the first movie is a nice touch. You will be very surprised at how good this movie really is. I laughed out loud a few times and got the old fashioned chill factor during a few scenes. What you want out of a Rocky movie is a connection to the underdog, it delivers. You want a speech that makes you want to take up jogging, done. You want a training montage that makes you sign up for next seasons biggest loser and change your life for the better, mission accomplished.",Rocky Balboa
709,primoz-krajcar,Rocky is back!,10,22 December 2006,I had the honor of watching the movie early on before other people had the chance to tell me how they saw it. I saw it as a great inspiring story that will find a path in all of our harts and minds. I do sincerely believe that a Rocky in this movie is like many true champions of the past. The resemblance to the first Rocky is quite big but let me tell you the story is great and some speeches and wise words Rocky gives to his son or Pauly or any other person are just great. In todays world those words fall into the right place. Rocky franchise is bigger for one more great story and one more great fight. And after all don't you think Sylvester Stallone worked really hard in the gym for this one? Da.. if I will look like him when I'm 60 than I to will pass the medical with flying colors.,Rocky Balboa

In my opinion it's the best movie of the year, the critics will never agree with me, but if you look back on all the series ever made, never has there been a series quite like Rocky. Rockey Balboa is not just another Rocky movie, Rockey balboa is the story of rocky, a story of the heart of men. It's the story of sly Stallone, it's a great film big story, this story goes back 30 years. And the message it gives is simple, but so very powerful. It's incredible. A combination of so many great things. A true knockout performance by Stallone. A great closure to the rocky series. A real winner. A must own!!",Rocky Balboa
711,jonesybaby,Orr....,7,31 January 2007,"I thought this movie was good for the very end, for Rocky getting his wish and putting all his demons behind him and bowing out with grace and his reputation in tact.I did think some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy but hey its a Rocky film. I did laugh my ass at the feeble attempt of little Marie trying to chant Rocky near the end of the fight.Its a good end to the series and i thought, as it should be, the fight at the end was realistic in terms of effect, obviously not in terms of the fight. If you saw that many punches in a real fight there would be a death every bout, but again that is the enjoyment of Rocky.Put it this way, i think the final Rocky film is a bigger hit than the Rambo film will be, a chuckle will be had.",Rocky Balboa
712,dominuche7,Bring back the same style and feeling as the original,10,23 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa bring back the same style as Sly gave to Rocky 1. No matter what people want to say about being realistic, any true Rocky fan will receive that same feeling that we all know so well by watching this perfect ending to a perfect series. The only thing I would have changed in this movie is making the work out scene a little longer. For those true Rocky fans out there...I want you to think about how the fight ends and think back to past Rockys and realize why Sly did what he did. This is truly a great movie that takes you back to memories that is the only way they should end this series. Rocky Balboa doesn't even compare to Rocky 5.. it blows it out of the water. I am so happy that he chose to make this and allow us, the fans, the enjoyment of one more round.",Rocky Balboa
713,banshee-irish-messenger,Rocky Balboa Is Best Rocky Movie Yet !!!!,10,20 December 2006,"WOW, is the best way to describe Rocky Balboa. Sylvester Stallone shows true heart in his best Rocky performance of all time. My wife, son and I are all huge Stallone fans and this movie shows why. Stallone has a deep passion for his work and in our opinion the best there ever has or will be. Stallone shows off his writing and directing skills to prove he has the brains to go with the brawn. If you are looking for a movie filled with a great mix of emotions than make Rocky Balboa your movie to see this Christmas season. It is great for all ages. Stallone should be up for another Oscar Award for this terrific movie. At age 60 I hope to still be in as fit shape ( or even half as good) as Stallone shows he is still in. Rocky Balboa shows that Stallone is good at whatever he does from action, drama, comedy or Sci-Fi. My family wants to thank Mr. Stallone for all the great hours of entertainment he has provided us over the years and we look forward to Rambo 4 in 2008. banshee-irish-messenger",Rocky Balboa
714,shazyde,Worth watching,6,30 January 2007,"Good movie and fitting ending. Though had the potential to be a lot lot better than it was. Similar to me and my school grades. Closer to the original Rocky as opposed to Rocky III and IV. This was more of an emotional movie as opposed to great action and fight scenes. It is not a typical Rocky movie in which you get a great rush of adrenaline but it has all the emotional elements of Rocky which you would expect such as his struggle of everyday life. The main thing about this movie is that it can be described as a fitting ending to a quite incredible collection of Rocky movies. Though the movie could have been More penetrative with more tension and adrenaline rushes, fortunately it has not been a let down (i.e Rocky V) and is well worth watching.",Rocky Balboa
715,nothingelsematrs,Sly's Best Work In 30 Years,9,22 March 2007,"I heard mixed reviews about this movie when it first came out - some people saying Stallone was doing it because it's the biggest commercial success he's had. Others said he simply wanted to make a great film. Well, I agree with the latter on this one. Sly has absolutely perfected Rocky Balboa, and this movie proves it. Sly was right in thinking that it wasn't over yet; he put the final chapter in the legacy the best way possible. Sly made the movie as real as can be, and it's certainly the most emotional since the original. The way you'd expect Rocky to be living these days, the emotions you'd imagine him feeling, the thoughts that must be going through his head; everything was portrayed perfectly. I felt like it was more of a reality movie than a fiction one, that's how real it felt. The characters and the actors who portrayed them did magnificently, and you can clearly see the intellect and maturity that Sly truly has through this film. The movie was some of Sly's best ever work, one of my new personal favorites, and the film managed to bring you back to when Rocky truly was your hero - and how he still may be.",Rocky Balboa
716,gerryhenderson2,A triumphant ending,9,24 December 2006,"I was born in 77, so I watched all the Rocky films when they came out in the 80's as a kid. I loved them back then, fighting my brothers as the minute it ended. As an adult going back to them, I saw Rocky I and II where really beautifully written and had a true heart felt story. The boxing was secondary to the real story of the man. I became even more engrossed by them. Truly the greatest underdog story of all time.The next three installments in the saga where a big let down and, in particular, Rocky IIII and V where a let down. The final V was not a good way to end the series. This is the biggest reason for Stallone making this new film.He put the series to bed with this film and gave it the send off it really deserved. The story is gripping and moving, you feel for Rocky in so many ways and he becomes more lovable and likable the longer the movie goes on. The boxing hardly matters till the last 20 minutes as Stallone takes you along for a ride in the life of someone that is tangible and more real than the usual Hollywood movie. Everyone in the film seems natural and the settings and interactions are more like life really is. Thats why it is so easy to buy in to the story.",Rocky Balboa
717,bya-2,Still the champ,8,22 December 2006,"Im sick of the bad press the final Rocky film is getting. I really don't know what to make of it. Honestly,how often do we get to see films where the audience cheers at the opening score and again at the closing credits? How often can we really see movies with a message than can make us feel good, that make us feel like we can do anything? Can we just take it for what it is, a decent film with a good heart? I'm willing to believe there's a little bit of Rocky in all of us, and that little bit, that underdog spirit, the fighter, is exactly what is best in people, and what should be rekindled. Bravo to Stallone for making us believe we can beat the odds one more time.",Rocky Balboa
718,incrediblem,Rocky has come full circle,10,17 July 2010,"When the first Rocky came out in 1976, I was 4 years old. About ten years later I saw that movie, together with my now passed father. Ever since, watching a Rocky-Movie, no matter which part, has been more than just watching the movie, it is part of getting older, you could say a little part of my life.Well things have to end at some point and letting a legend like Rocky end with the not nearly as good fifth part always felt wrong to me. But Stallone came back and did this sixth and final part of the Rocky saga and it is a worthy end.Rocky Balboa connects to the first part in so many ways and it shows us the fragile part of Rocky. It shows us, what we all know, that life is neither simple nor nice. That you have to stand up to get what you want.I am really grateful that Stallone did this last part and I can only recommend this movie to anyone who liked Rocky and to anyone for whom Rocky is a connection to his childhood.",Rocky Balboa
719,joemama22,"If your a die hard Rocky fan, you will be a little disappointed",5,22 December 2006,"i am a 10 out of 10 on the rocky fan scale. I am 24 years old. So this review is coming from someone who has been waiting to see this movie and isn't a 50 year old who just is go ing to see it so i can get a rejuvenation in life. I didn't have high expectations so that is probably why I am going easy on it. To start, the first 45 min. of this movie goes nowhere! Absolutely Nowhere! in the past Rocky's all of the outside the ring drama was there for a reason and made sense. This time it seems as tho Sly just needed something to eat up some time. Another thing, The whole computer fight thing just made me feel awkward. Nobody would ever be at a bar watching a computer fight. The co-stars of the movie were not great either. The training montage was horrendous. Its like they just decided to add ""gonna fly now"" to him working out and that was it! They didn't get into the period of time between Rocky accepting the fight and the actual fight. It was almost like, hes the press conference, meet with his son. Off to Vegas. Those seem like the 3 consecutive scenes that were done. The good things I liked about the movie, the Fight scene. It obviously went with the template for all Rocky movies. Show Round one. Show round 2. Montage of all the rounds in between. Last round. (if you didn't see this going to the last round, i feel sorry for you) I did get goosebumps towards the end of the movie. Had to fight back some man tears. Chilling scenes. The end was great. If I was going to see this movie, every thing you need to know about why the fight is happening can be seen on the previews. The fight and the ending is the reason why you watch this movie. If your a die-hard rocky fan, then you hae to see this movie. Don't have high expectations. If your interested in seeing it, wait for DVD. Or if your leaving the movie theater, just stick your head in the rocky theater on your way out. If the fight scene is on, then grab a seat and check it out. I know I will be peaking my head inside all Rocky showings trying to see if it is the fight scene. If it is there is no doubt in my mind im watching the end of this movie again. Just for the goosebumps!",Rocky Balboa
720,gabuawad@yahoo.com,Outstanding,10,3 January 2007,"Sylvester Stallone has stunned us one last time!! The movie, plot, comeback and ending of this astonishing franchise is OUTSTANDING :-) I've always believed that in the end of Rocky V there was just something missing, it's not over, he can give more and this is not the ideal way to end this story!! But with Rocky Balboa I'm now satisfied and convinced that this story, this epic, this remarkable piece of work throughout over 30 years will live forever and the character of Rocky can now find peace within. I can't deny that it's sad to see him go away , but with the completion of this last part I'm sure that Rocky Balboa will always remain in our hearts and minds as one of the most famous, outstanding and remembered characters the film industry all over the world will know . Thank you",Rocky Balboa
721,boeing46,The second best of the Rocky Movies,7,27 December 2006,They could have left out the conflict with his son in my opinion. The movie had a similar build up like the first Rocky concluding with an exciting ending. It is time for Stalone to hang up the gloves though. I am hoping to see one more Rambo to end that series. I would have liked to see that Rocky had learned to protect his face. I've never seen a boxer lead with his face as is in all the rocky movies i've seen. The rocky movies are always better when Stalone has most of the control of script and direction. Stalone was in better shape for this movie than he was for the first Rocky. He is in unbelievable shape for a man his age. Stalone looked almost exactly the same as he did in the first Rocky. It's good that he has found the Rocky and the Rambo theme movies because i really haven't enjoyed much else that he has done.,Rocky Balboa
722,ep142614,Very Good Send Off,10,7 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa First off this film is very good. It is definitely not a classic like the first Rocky but it is just as good as the second film. It is very slow paced and is more dialogue driven then the other Rocky films.Spoilers The film begins showing Mason Dixon beating X-Cell for a title defense. He is getting booed as people do not think he is a real champion. The camera then goes to Rocky getting out of bed in the early morning. He feeds his turtles and visits Adrian's Grave. He sits and stares at the grave with Paulie by his side.Rocky now drives a large white van. He owns a restaurant named Adrians. He spends his nights telling old fight stories of him and Apollo Creed and telling stories of Mickey in the gym. His regular patron is Spider Rico, played once again by Pedro Lovell. Lovell plays the part wonderfully and actually has a fairly large supporting role.In a very emotional scene Rocky and Paulie visit Adrian's grave on her anniversary and also visit the remains of the ice skating rink. He also goes to the pet shop and looks at Mickey's Gym, saying ""How You Doing Mick"". He has flashbacks of Adrian going into his apartment on there first date. This scene plays with a great score by Conti and is so touching.Following the anniversary Rocky goes to the Lucky Seven Tavern which is operated by Little Marie. Geraldine Hughes and Stallone have excellent chemistry and she was an excellent choice for the role. Rocky is hassled by some punks outside the tavern and he ""takes care of business"". Hughes is fantastic in these scenes. James Francis Kelly ""Steps"" is shortly after introduced. Although the character meant well it probably would have been better top use his screen time to something else. The character was mediocre as was the actor who played him. ""One scene when Rocky picked out his new dog with him kind of dragged on a bit"" There are many emotional scenes in the film with Rocky and Paulie. One scene is absolutely heart breaking as Rocky completely breaks down. He says about Adrians death ""I never thought it would be this hard"". Stallone and Young could win Oscars for this film. Young is absolutely brilliant and Stallone is excellent. They have never been closer. One of Young's most memorable scenes is when he is fired from his job at the meat plant. He looks so depressed and plays it excellently.Some great Stallone scenes include when he is attempting to get back his boxing license and those numerous scenes with his Son. Milo Ventilimia does an OK job in the role but in my opinion appeared to be intimated by Stallone. He was a weak character choice and didn't appear to be to convincing.Following getting his license Rocky must convince his son that it is OK for him to fight. He then goes to Vegas for a press conference with Dixon and his trainer. ""By the way Harry Sanders is terrific as Dixons trainer"" We then go into the training montage which got a clapping applause by the crowd. It was short but very sweet. On the eve of the fight Marie visits Rocky in his hotel room to give him Adrians picture. It was very touching and extremely emotional.Following this the much anticipated fight takes place. It is shorter then the others and yes Rocky does come out to ""High Hopes"". The fight was very real but also very different then the other films.The fight hit its pinnacle in the last round when you think Rocky might have been killed, he gets on one knee and then it happens, he sees Adrian and Mickey tells him to 'get up"" in a flashback. It is terrific and is a great piece to this training montage.Don't wanna give to much else away. But this film is superb. It is not as good as the original but who really thought it would be. It is very similar to Rocky II and I would rank it as ties right now as the second best entry of the series. Those expecting Rocky III or Rocky IV would be extremely disappointed. The acting is very good by all involved. Sanders, Tarver and Burton are very good, Young, Stallone and Hughes are excellent and Milo and Kelly are mediocre.Overall 3 ½ out of 4 stars!!",Rocky Balboa
723,trentglenn,Rocky Balboa -OSCAR worthy!,10,23 December 2006,"I saw Rocky Balboa on WEDS. night....what an excellent film! This is about aging.What do we do when we wake up one day and we realize we're old?Do we let it go or do we do something about it?Rocky spends 3+ years trying to figure out how to do that after Adrain passes away,but it takes new friends, a restored relationship w/his son,a hard hitting 10 round fight,and faith in not only himself but God to overcome his personal tragedies and move on into the last phase of his life.I teared up when Rocky was talking to Paulie and started crying.I cheered when Rocky jacked that guy up at the bar for talking trash on Marie.I couldn't move when the fight started....and btw,it was one great fight!So real,i could not take my eyes of it for a second!The final scene in the movie also had me tearing up too!The music was good too,I know there were a few flaws to this movie....but not enough to say anything negative!I give this movie a 9 for being wonderful!",Rocky Balboa
724,LinkinPark219,This movie left me speechless,10,22 December 2006,"Sylvester Stallone is back and hasn't lost his touch. Rocky Balboa is a must see film and is one of the best of 2006. Stallone, once again, has another brilliant performance as one of the most iconic characters in film history. Although he is aging, it's very hard to tell considering the phenomenal shape that he got in for the film. This movie really displays why we love these movies and this character. Rocky Balboa brings much back from the original movies with characters, scenery, and much more. The supporting actors and actresses also do a great job with Burt Young, Milo Ventimiglia, and Geraldine Hughes. Also, Antonio Tarver does a solid job of portraying Mason ""The Line"" Dixon"", a cocky yet disrespected boxer fighting for support and pride. I would highly recommend this movie to all Rocky fans out there and definitely recommend this movie to other people who haven't seen these movies or who might have only seen one or two of them. Rocky Balboa gives audiences a great in-depth view of who Rocky Balboa truly is, inside and out. Don't waste your time sitting on the couch.

It is not that I didn't appreciate ""Rocky"" but honestly I became one of those disappointed fans with the bad taste of Rocky V still lingering in my palate. So I fought tooth and nail against being sucked in by the hype...but I happily failed and was lead sweetly back to 1976 with that gentle Rocky nature that captured me from the beginning. There is an opportunity for the audience to go down memory lane with Rocky as he comes to terms with his past, his memories, and how powerful one individual can be. This is a tale of an underdog who finally wrestles the beast and comes out from the basement wholeremember, a fighter fights. Actually it really doesn't matter what number of stars this film gets because it will bring in the fans who made Rocky a cultural icon. It will also bring in the curious that want to see if Stallone can pull magic out of the Rocky bag just one more time. Perhaps I should have started this with, ""Dear Mr. Stallone...I am, once again, a believer!""",Rocky Balboa

It's a movie folks, leave a little to the imagination here. After all, Rocky is the symbol of a man who is all heart, someone who pushes himself to greatness no matter what obstacle is in front of him. If the objective of a good movie is having audience members leave with a better insight on the human condition, ROCKY BALBOA Succeeds. As a people, we tolerate the joy with the pain, wins with the losses, ups with the downs BUT WE KEEP MAKIN MOVES. Don't ever let others place your ticket in society. Everyone has crazy dreams, Stallon was born to an average middle class family in PA with a lazy eye and a speech impediment. There were times he was frustrated with the cards he was dealt but he countered his physical drawbacks by hitting the gym religiously and becoming a top action film star.

I don't remember ever laughing as much in any other Rocky movie like I did in this one. Stallone was vintage Rocky. He played it to perfection. The writing was great, the acting was great, and the fight was amazing. It was shot so much differently than any of the other fights but none the less and was a great experience. The realism was second to none. I'd see it again. I'd rank this as #1 or #1a to ""Rocky"" out of the six installments.""It ain't about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.

Luckily I was proved wrong, good acting, great training sequence and felt that 80's movies magic back on the screen (especially during montage sequences ;). Some of the speeches felt quite cheesy, but they were great in they own awkward way. Burt Young was great as always playing Paulie and it was a real shame that Adrian was not on this one. During the first hour or so was mainly just plain drama, but it was well written and when the training started I personally was very moved about the way the whole thing was made. Also extra plus for Six feet mafias song for Mason Dixon entry. Hopefully Rambo would continue the Sly's comeback, but once again I doubt it....",Rocky Balboa

I liked the rocky series for what it was...an underdog series. This movie is so much more...If u don't want to see a Rocky movie imagine it with a different name and go watch it nonetheless. This is the best movie Stallone ever made so far...it made me accept him as an actor and as a director just like Clint did when he made the unforgiven. Stallone does not make another boxing movie here......he makes a documentary...he makes a movie that brings life to a fictional hero...he makes a movie that makes you see balboa as a real life fighter and person, with his past, present and future...he makes a wonderful movie. My advice to you is don't judge a book by its cover...Give Stallone a chance and you will not regret it.

This movie is unforgettable. The artistic talent absorbing the viewer into this movie.This movie will bring tears down your eyes, and will paint a smile on your face. It was more concentrated on the new image of Rocky, his love in something he does comes from his heart.As long as you have heart, you have everything. The ending proved that.Amazing movie! Unforgettable ya Stallone!",Rocky Balboa
732,Skywalkerbill,Excellent!!!,10,27 December 2006,"Sylvester Stallone did great. I remember reading when he started writing this film and got mad and threw it away. I think he gave up at one point but I could be wrong. The producers did great to. Bill Conti's score was great and I'm a dude but I cried a few times. What memories the film brought out, Stallone did an excellent job acting. The writing was terrific, the story concept was strong and most of all real. All I can say is enjoy it, cry if you must, you won't be disappointed, I haven't seen a heartfelt, sentimental film this good in years. Great cast as well. Go see it. I was especially impressed at the directing. Stallone really knows the style and knows how to bring the story to it's full authenticity. God bless Rocky Balboa!",Rocky Balboa
733,pamelamozuch,Confused,10,25 March 2021,Can't understand why so many comments were made by this movie not any one person mentioned Little Marie character. Rocky supported her as a child now that she is all grown up it's her turn to be there Rocky. Marie to me had huge impact for Rocky in this movie ty,Rocky Balboa
734,scelentano-3,Rocky Balboa shows us the meaning of a true champion!,10,22 December 2006,"Sylvester Stallone hits a knockout in the best Rocky since the original. He takes you back over his 30-year career as a fighter and shows us a Rocky that is vulnerable yet has not and will never give up. For me it was the most emotional one of all. Adrian is gone and you can feel the emptiness in Rocky as he tries to maintain his relationship with his son. Paulie (Burt Young) has his biggest role of all the previous Rocky's and does a great job. Also, Geraldine Hughes is wonderful as ""little Marie."" Stallone keeps it real and I felt believable. It's definitely an emotional roller-coaster. Don't miss this Rocky!",Rocky Balboa
735,kimc-17,It's Not Rocky 6,10,21 December 2006,"Loved Rocky Balboa! Loved Sylvester Stallone in Rocky Balboa! I didn't go with expectations of it being Rocky VI. I've seen all the other Rocky's and wanted to see this one as well. Rocky Balboa explores more of the human side of Rocky. It delves into relationships he has had in the past...it touches on the current troubled relationship with his son. It also re-introduces ""Little Marie"". I was hoping and happy to see that they did not take this into a ""romatic"" direction because I think that would have been viewed as disrespectful of his wife Adrian's memory. Don't go and see this movie hoping it is another Rocky. Go see this movie to be inspired, feel uplifted and for nostalgia. Sly's body looks awesome in this movie and the boxing scenes are as good as ever. Stallone is an amazing writer, director and actor. He took Rocky Balboa to a whole other level with this movie. I give it a 10 easily.",Rocky Balboa
736,dtrout-3,"No Oscar Nominations, but a Good Trip Down Memory Lane",7,29 November 2006,"Just 2 hours ago, I exited an advance screening for ROCKY BALBOA in downtown Chicago. I had a few of questions going into the theater: (1) Why wasn't this called ROCKY VI? (2) Will this stop the downward trend in quality of the ROCKY series? (3) Why is the movie being specifically marketed to faith groups? And (4) Will Sly Stallone be there in person? First, if anyone saw ROCKY V, you know that it was one of the worst movies of the 1990's. That alone is good enough reason why not to call it ROCKY VI. Also, ROCKY BALBOA is a really good cap on the series. There is a lot of quick flashback moments to scenes in previous ROCKY'S, but it's not overdone either. This definitely stopped the downward trend, and was more of a character piece on the thoughts and decisions of a retired, widowed boxer. It is a slow moving dialogue movie, with only the last 20 minutes containing the training and big boxing match, so don't expect an action-filled adventure. It is a closer resemblance to the original ROCKY. There were some acting flaws with some minor roles, and the hokeyest part was how the crowd was one-sided pro-Rocky. Las Vegas is a gambling town, so there are always cheering for both boxers. Even with the cheesy moments, it was a very inspirational movie, and overall clean with a PG rating. Anyone who grew up with ROCKY or enjoyed the previous movies will find this a very good trip down memory lane. FYI... Even though there were a few faith-filled lines in the movie, I think the faith-driven marketing is more financially driven than anything else. Also, Sly was not at the theater, but he was doing a press conference later that day at a Chicago hotel (but I couldn't make it).",Rocky Balboa
737,tennistoody,Rocky still has the heart of a champion,10,24 December 2006,"Rocky, of course, has been an American icon for over two and a half decades. I remember being so excited as a kid when each new installment was released. Never once was I disappointed. There is little that can be said to take away from the inspiration which is contained in each and every movie. Rocky Balboa wraps the story up nicely while never losing sight of the old Rocky which we all grew to love. It was yet another inspiring tale with much uplifting dialogue and, as always, a fantastic fight at the end. Sylvester Stallone is to be commended for creating such a memorable figure and skillfully portraying him acrossed a span of nearly three decades. I'll probably go back to the theater for at least two more viewings. It's really a great movie!!!",Rocky Balboa
738,robin_r_hollenbeck,"""Rocky Balboa"" does not disappoint!!",10,4 December 2006,"I recently attended a pre-screening for ""Rocky Balboa"" in Denver. This movie was so powerful, that I went through every emotion imaginable while watching it. There are some very humorous parts in the movie, there are some sad parts of the movie. However, the message of the film is moving. This particular ""Rocky"" movie focuses on Rocky's life after boxing. It really develops his character in ways that the other movies have not. The trailer that is out does not do this movie justice. If you want to see a movie with a deep message and a whole lot of heart, you will not be disappointed. Don't think ""Another 'Rocky' movie"" and brush it off. This movie is well written, the acting is great, the characters seem like real people. Even though I have already seen it, I will be back on opening day to see it again. It is an instant classic. So keep an open mind and give this movie a chance, you will be glad that you did!",Rocky Balboa
739,blackcyrax,Rocky Balboa better than the original,10,21 December 2006,"I saw the movie 2 hours ago.While watching it,I passed through every emotion that a human can have, sad ones and good ones, i cried lots of times, i felt like that was happening to me, it was like a part of me.I watched 1000+ movies, but i never had the feeling i had when watching Rocky Balboa.I'm speechless. In my opinion this is the perfect movie.It's the best from the series,it is the cherry from the cake.The storyline is unique, and unlike other rocky movies is based on the ""heart"" and on the human spirit. Rocky didn't go the distance, he didn't had the eye of the tiger but he proved to himself and to the others that he still got the burning heart of a warrior. The soundtrack was excellent,my compliments to bill conti.I've seen all of Sly's movies and i can say that this is one of his best movie, if not the best, and his acting was great and it all seems so real, that you actually think you've seen that in some other time and you'll later see the movie like memories of your own.Instant classic.You shouldn't miss this movie by any means.",Rocky Balboa
740,craigtrickett,Excellent Conclusion To The Series,10,22 January 2007,"Well done Stallone on this excellent conclusion to the series of films. After being a fan of the previous movies I had been gagging for the chance to see Rocky on the big screen and Rocky Balboa didn't fail to impress.Stallones acting throughout is flawless and the camera work, story telling and methodology behind the film all tie in perfectly with the other movies. Some sentimental moments looking back at people, locations, and scenes are effective however those of you that haven't seen the other films may not find this significant.In true Rocky fashion the final scenes rouse the audience in a way that only Rocky can.Five out of five",Rocky Balboa
741,prawaltong,"stunning, powerful, punchie!!",10,13 March 2007,"Best of the Best movie for 2007.I expect nothing from this movie, but gain full respect for Stallone.The movie offers total entertainment while providing the inspiration, cheerful for me.The rhythm songs, undoubtedly, play important part and always come at the right time.Do not miss the movie.. If you are getting older and looking for the turning point of your life, heres the right one.If you are dad with the grow up kids, you will learn how good dad should be.If you are greedy man, you will learn that giving away with no objective is the best.there are so many sensational parts of this movie, I love it",Rocky Balboa
742,vinbuuren,rocky rocks,9,22 December 2006,for those of you that grew up believing the rocky legacy and was sorely disappointed by the rocky 5 film.this should reinstall your beliefs.Stallone looking good with or without plastic surgery . this is the film he should have always made and 4 the rocky purists i hope this rings true.cos it pulled my heartstrings and thats enough.the film for me was totally plausible.5 is the film that Stallone should have never made.same as the Rambo trilogy.oh and besides my points of interest on IMDb.taken your bullshit ten lines of interest and ram them up yourYankee arses you pricks.but what can you say about A FILm BASED SOLELY ON LEGACY because this has it all.this film is 9 out of ten without biased opinion,Rocky Balboa
743,tylerdorais,A Movie for all Ages,10,15 December 2006,"This movie was worth waiting for! It is full of life lessons - all worthwhile for people of all ages. This movie touches your every sense. It made me feel as good as I did after watching the 1st Rocky years ago - hopeful, grateful - it made me believe in myself & others!Kudos to Sylvester Stallone for fighting like a Lion to get this film made the way he wanted. He fought hard to make sure the last chapter on Rocky, his Rocky, was presented the way he wanted! Rocky is a real live man..not an inaccurate Hollywood plastic ... but a character we all can relate to. This movie was written and presented the way Mr. Stallone wanted ... thank God!! Its a movie to see with your kids ... your dad....your mom .... those you love...its the kind of movie this country needs more of.Thank you Mr. Stallone",Rocky Balboa
744,bpreyss,a heart-felt and meaningful end to the Rocky series,10,15 December 2006,"Now this is how you put to bed the greatest underdog story ever told. Rocky Balboa deserves to be taken seriously because it really is a well-made film. Powerful acting, an uplifting message, and of course, some classic Rocky boxing fireworks make this film one my favorites of the entire year. GO SEE IT - YOU WILL NOT BE Disappointed! (I saw an advanced screening in Chicago - Sly introduced it - He came off as a real humble, decent guy. He said he wasn't happy how Rocky V turned out. Well, he wasn't the only one. I tell you what though - He definitely made amends with this one because it may be the best, even better than the first. )",Rocky Balboa
745,gopinsc,WOW This was a Great Ride,10,19 December 2006,"I know that Rocky 5 did not do to well at the box office but that should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. I was able to go with my father in law to see a screening of the movie last night and all I can say is WOW! It was so much better than I expected. I would place this movie at the top of the Rocky movie film list. It is more in the lines with Rocky 1 than 2-5. It really is not a formula movie like 2-5 even though it keeps what made those movies great. I will tell you this, the boxing only comes in the last 20 or so mins of the movie. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. I would dare to say its one of the years if not the decade's best movies.",Rocky Balboa
746,cjw_55106,True Fans says thumbs up,8,19 December 2006,"I must admit, I am a bit biased as I have been a huge fan of the series from it's onset some 30 years ago. That being said, I thought it was a very touching end to the legacy that is Rocky Balboa. Paulie revised a role that only Burt Young could play and was very good. This film is not about boxing, but about the human condition. I would assume those of us over the age of 30 will get more out of it than our younger counterparts. Losing someone so close to you and realizing that you cant live in the past, nor can you just let life happen, Rocky Balboa shows people how to live life, how to quiet the beast down inside of us all, that yearns to get out. The flashbacks were beautifully done. In fact, they were so good, I wished that Adrian could have made an appearance. It was a nice touch bringing back some of the characters from the past movies.",Rocky Balboa
747,Wookielover95,The Champion of All Underdog Stories,10,23 December 2006,"Saw Rocky Balboa the day it came out. There's not much to expect from it. The movie can be upsetting once you've seen it. Adrian died and there was no heads-up to that. When Rocky lost the match to Mason ""the line"" Dixon, I was shocked. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Everybody was waiting for Rocky to win, but my dad said that would've been cheesy if he did. He had to struggle just to get his boxing license back from retirement and it wasn't even worth it. He still lost. It kind of made me feel better when I remembered he named his restaurant after his wife that passed on. My favorite quote from the movie was: 'It's not about how long you get through life. It's about, how much you can take, and keep going.' I very, very strongly suggest that you go see Rocky Balboa.'EYE OF THE TIGER'",Rocky Balboa
748,animatorgod,The best Rocky since the first two (hands down),10,19 December 2006,"I was extremely skeptical of this film (I thought it was laughable at best when I learned of the plot), but I was completely floored when I saw it. If you have ever enjoyed Rocky (especially the first one), you simply must see this. Not is it just a great Rocky film its a great film, period. It demonstrates the best humanity has to offer and the undying will of the human spirit. This movie also has some surprises so big you have to see it yourself.Sylvester Stallone and supporting actors give heart felt and surprising performances. You'll be standing in your seats screaming at the screen! The theater was completely nuts by the end of the movie. I haven't witnessed people get so riled up in a movie since he beat Apollo in Rocky 2.This movie is a complete left hook out of the blue. I was totally expecting this movie to stink. Go to the theaters now!",Rocky Balboa
749,disruptor-17286,Not as good as the previous movies.,6,1 August 2021,"First of all Rocky V had rocky have brain damage which we clearly saw at his fight vs Tommy Gunn. But in this movie it was a misdiagnosis. Second of all Paulie seems to be more annoying every rocky movie he's in. Third, I feel like Mason Dixon doesn't get enough screen time. We barely know anything about him. He's been in this movie for maybe 15 minutes (and that's counted with the final fight) while other fighters had way way way more screen time in the previous rocky movies. And this movie is kinda slow which makes it boring. The whole little Marie thing is just not working for me. And leaving Adrian out of this movie i don't know how i feel of that.",Rocky Balboa
750,blondienaturally,one more round!,10,20 December 2006,"I have seen all of the Rocky movies and own them. I have been a fan from the beginning. I suffer from pulmonary fibrosis/coped and I have used Rockys line ""one more round"" every time I have to go into the hospital, I listen to that music and it gives me a lift and a little more fight to go on. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched them. He tells it like it is. I am so glad he came back again because we all need that inspiration. I just got out of the hospital in November and I may have to be back in before Christmas so this movie came out just in time and now when my family looks sad because of my illness not only will I say I got one more round but also it ain't over till its over!!!",Rocky Balboa
751,silentech,Good movie,8,23 December 2006,"Well,After watching, it didn't gave the sensation the previous Rocky's did, not at all to be honest. But that's not why this movie was made I suppose.It's really more down to earth and giving a realistic look at things when someone gets older. It's a good movie and a worthy end to the Rocky series. Eventually time catches in on all of us.Little thing I don't get is that his brain-damage suddenly has healed over the years? Worth the ticked though. Good acting by the entire cast.",Rocky Balboa

753,acornoaktree,A shame that this masterpiece had to end.,10,20 December 2006,"Thank you Sly! This movie was exactly what I would have written if something had to be written. It is scary how similar this movie and the one that I wrote in my head really are (Minus the whole dead Adrian thing, of course). I really would like to know why she was not in it, and moreover How she died. The only thing wrong with the movie is that the saga is over and not much has been left to the imagination. I cherish all of the Rocky movies and I often find myself modeling my life based on the lessons that are contained in them. Rocky is a perfect role model for anyone. Every time I need a boost in order to overcome a challenge all I have to do is think about Rocky 4 and that training montage and there is no stopping me.12/21/06 I was just thinking about the whole Adrian thing, and I realized that if she was alive in this movie he would have never had the ""Stuff in the basement"" and this movie would never have happened.",Rocky Balboa

The movie doesn't just serve as a nostalgia trip, it further cements the legacy of Rocky Balboa as a character, and re-captures the spirit of the first 3 films. Talia Shire is missed (though seen in flashbacks) but reuniting Stallone with Burt Young (Paulie) and Tony Burton (Duke) is fantastic!! There are a few surprises and some references to the original film, as well as some scenes that may remind the viewer of scenes and instances from the previous ""Rocky"" installments, in particular the first three movies.

Rocky is a movie for all generation to watch and relate to. It will continue to be an epic movie for times to continue. If you have not seen a Rocky movie then you have not experienced life, I would recommend seeing every Rocky movie before you see this one to get the full effect of the experience. Rocky Balboa continues to have all of the familiar qualities of all of the other films. Its a true inspiration, every fighter know that everyone has that one last fight in them if there willing to give it there all.

Although you may call my biased as I'm a fan, I am a fair and honest judge about movies.Though it's like any other Rocky movie, an underdog who shows the world otherwise, this one is better written with better actors and a spectacular fight scene with the entire HBO camera crew filming the final fight. What I loved most about the movie was that it felt real, like it could have really happened if Rocky Balboa was a real character. It's a heart pounding, adrenaline rush and will leave you loving Rocky yet again (or start to if you never have).I can't express enough about how excellent the movie was without spoiling it, so I'll just say this, give it a shot and I promise you'll at least leave with a better opinion than when you went in.",Rocky Balboa
757,sethahester,The best Rocky film in the last 15 years!,10,20 December 2006,"I have been awaiting this movie for months and went to see it the first day it came to the local theater. It was an amazing movie that left me on the edge of my seat for every second of the action scenes.Most of the movie is not action packed but an emotional drama. However, the action scenes were fantastic. The fight fight between Rocky Balboa and Mason Dixon is shot to look like a PPV fight and makes the viewer feel like they are watching an actual HBO PPV.Most people had a misconception that the movie would just be about Rocky doing nothing but fighting. However, Rocky Balboa shows ""it's not how hard you punch, but how hard you can punch and keep moving"" In my opinion it was one of the best Rocky films ever to be made.",Rocky Balboa

(I was under ten when five came out) All in all... I loved this movie! The only complaint that I can make is that they focus a little too much on Lil Marie during the fight. She can never replace Adrian. Other than that a sure winner that I would love to see again. A lot of people have said that Rocky 5 left a sour taste in their mouths (I disagree), but I must say this movie is an excellent end to the long-loved series.

""Rocky Balboa"" was GREAT. Sly Stallone did this franchise the proper send off in this sixth installment. Taken back to the feel of Rocky 1 & 2, Sylvester nails the part he was born to play. Lets be honest this franchise is not about theatrics and effects but about emotion and heart, and thats exactly how it was captured in the final film. It will make you laugh, cry, believe in yourself and want to kick some butt.

This Rocky has all the music, drama, and excitement as the collaboration of Rocky 1-4. It of course isn't by all means the best rocky. I thought that rocky (1-2) 1.5 was the better, but this one touched my heart. It was very dramatic and inspiring like the other four rockys. I went into the theater expecting the worst but instead I got the chills! When the movie was over everyone clapped, like I had expected! This movie was a very good ending for the series.

He gets beat up through most of the movie comes back and wins blah blah blah .. the series started to taper off all the way up to 5 ... Everyone thought it was over But Sly brought it back ... A lot of people were expecting this movie to fail miserably and be a joke. I, myself was expecting it to blow. But i was very impressed i think this was the Greatest way to end the Rocky Saga .. i wasn't expecting it to be such a depressing movie, but it played out really well. I watched People in the audience and there emotions were taking over .. who was tearing who was laughing who was getting nervous and then the excitement for the final bout people jumping out of there seats and cheering .. i think this was a great movie ... definitely worth the price ...

Well, today I saw Rocky Balboa and it was fantastic...no shame with this one...""ABSOLUTELY"" a perfect ending. It was that good kind of predictable, of course you know what is going to happen, but you can't wait. I will see this again, this time with my skeptical wife and not with my two kids who were familiar with the Rocky series and loved it too! The training and fighting was realistic and age sensitive...nothing was superhuman or save the world kind of stuff.

His character was right on target, and I was amazed after over 15 years since the last film, all the characters fell right in place. This may be the finest in the series, it came back to what Rocky was all about and just finished his career. I must admit, you will need to appreciate Rocky to truly understand his character in this film. I will definitely be watching this again along with the rest of the Rocky collection.

I'm not normally a softy for movies but I cried 5 times during this movie. I know everyone is skeptical as to how they pull this off without it being cheesy or dumb. Trust me, they do it perfectly.

Surprisingly 2/3's of the movie did not have him training or fighting at all. I was entertained the whole movie and it had a little humor to it as well. Definitely doesn't disappoint all of the other Rocky movies, I thought it ranked up with the rest of them. This is worth seeing. I thought Stallone did a nice job in this movie as well. They do a nice job of making this movie as realistic as possible to make the movie seem more real. And this time, I really had no idea who was going to win the Rocky fight which was kind of cool as well.

If you can relate at all to the fighter from Philly and his life through Rocky I - V, then this movie will either reach or exceed your expectations. Anyone not familiar with the series before this still can enjoy it, however this movie is definitely geared for the Rocky fans. There is a new plot line but is is drenched in flashbacks and memories. Cameos abound and subtle references from all the movies are throughout.I have never wanted to go see a movie a second time in a theatre - 'Rocky Balboa' has changed that. I will go again this week.",Rocky Balboa
769,boonabanks,Please see this,10,21 December 2006,"If you haven't seen it, go see it! Rocky Balboa reminds us what the American Dream is all about. Trying and failing and getting back up again. It is so touching and moving. You will love it, your kids will love it, your parents will love it. I laughed, cried, got out of my seat. There were people in the aisles sparring at each other during the fight scene. You will be so uplifted by this. Kudos to Stallone for getting this through. Rocky went back to being that man that was more in tune with his heart and his gut than anyone else. This is the Rocky who loves Adrian more than anything in the world, no matter what. This is the Rocky that we love to love, the reason Stallone became a star. We even see that familiar hat and the glasses when he's reading again. In Summary, see Rocky Balboa.",Rocky Balboa
770,joestyle01930,Yo Adrian!!! He did it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,21 December 2006,"Thank you Sylvester Stallone for bringing back this franchise to it's proper status. I loved the first Rocky movie. The second one continued the characters story lines well and had a hell of an ending. The third one was where things got a little bit too flashy, but it had the emotional death of mickey, Mr. T's Clubber Lang, and a great twist of Apollo backing up the Italian Stallion. Part 4 was a generic movie with lots of music and flashbacks, a formidable but cartoonish villain in Ivan Drago, and the shocker of Apollo's death. Part 5 was a bit of a downer, I appreciate the mickey flashbacks and going back to the streets approach, but tommy the Gunn was annoying and it just didn't seem it should end with rocky fighting in the streets. Rocky Balboa brings all the elements of what made the original movie so great. The look of Philadelphia, original characters (Paulie, Duke, Little Marie, Spider Rico, Cuff & Link), a heartwarming father/son story, and an emotional message of a man who feels it doesn't matter what age you are, if you have a dream, you gotta go for it. I'm happy that Stallone can show everyone who has been mocking him for ever thinking of doing another Rocky movie, that anything is possible. Thank you Stallone for bringing this great series to a perfect conclusion.",Rocky Balboa
771,mareidxi,Good final and redeeming chapter to Rocky story,8,22 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa is just what you want and expect from a final chapter in the Rocky story. It's not stellar theater, or any sort of classic in the making, but it's entertaining and brings good closure to Rocky. It plays to what fans want to see: the traditional training and fight scenes while bringing back old characters and flashbacks. Stallone also does a good job returning to the original Rocky feel of an independent movie while adding in everything that is current about TV, Philadelphia, boxing, and culture. It's a good movie and one that any Rocky fan should see. A very good end, and redemption for the horrible Rocky 5 movie. Besides, Sylvester Stallone is HUGE yet again in it. Props for training that hard at age 60.",Rocky Balboa
772,bobbyj-11,Good and worth the wait,7,21 December 2006,"I found the film to be a decent way to end the career of Rocky, if that's what they intend to do. The film ended but not in such a way where the franchise is totally done. Either way, if Rocky comes out of retirement at 75 and wants to fight a giant robot from outer space my ass is going to be in that theater.Back to the movie, I found that it was just too short for all the characters and sub-plots. Geraldine Hughes pretty much replaces Addriane, but she plays the opposite than she did in Rocky 4 and 5 and somewhat Rocky 3, she's all about Balboa kicking' ass. Which is good, but I felt that this character was a very obvious replacement. Her character just seemed to be a way for a female to support the leading man not really that she was necessary. I can see her being in the movie and not being in the movie and the story still going on (minus a few scenes) This one is ranks up there with Rocky 2, and beats 3,4,and 5 out the water. I don't think it was better than Rocky, but its hard to shoot the same bullseye twice.",Rocky Balboa

774,oscarmarroquin20,Rocky Comes Out Swinging,10,21 December 2006,"Excellent movie! Brings back fond memories of the first one. Great story in an age of mindless action and lackluster storytelling, Stallone crafts an endearing story that grasps our attention and allows us to embrace the real world. This is truly a return to form for Stallone and it's great to see him back in action! This movie will bring box office gold as the 1st day's receipts show. Stallone IS BACK! All Hail, ""Rocky Balboa""! Skeptics and trash talkers should see the movie first before opening their mouths! As far as Stallone's age,60,he's in better shape than most of young Hollywood. Stallone's persona is definite inspiration to us all!",Rocky Balboa
775,shadow6-1,As Good as 1976's Rocky!,10,21 December 2006,"First, the IMDb plot summary is just wrong. Rocky does not return to the ring because he needs money. He returns because he feels incomplete, and is dealing with the loss of his soul-mate Adrian.I remember being inspired by ""Rocky"" in 1976, and I was inspired by ""Rocky Balboa"" in a similar, but different way. For the old fans, there are plenty of nuggets, like the return of Cuff and Link, and Spider Rico, of all people.When the movie begins, Rocky is clearly still grieving over Adrian. The interaction between Rocky and Pauly is more than comic relief this time. When Rocky goes on what appears to be his annual remembrance of Adrian, Paulie expresses his pain and discomfort at being there. Once he gives his reason, you finally understand why Paulie acted the way he did during the entire ""Rocky"" series of movies. The bitter comments, the alcohol, it all makes sense now.Rocky makes a great statement to his son about life, and another one to the Boxing Commission.The ""Rocky"" was a testament to will, hope, determination, and desire. ""Rocky Balboa"" is a reflection on life by a man who has experienced the highs and lows. I loved this movie.",Rocky Balboa
776,RCchicago,He did it right.,9,22 December 2006,"I always wondered how Sly could write such deep and meaningful movies like Rocky I and II and then end the series with such lame and campy flicks like Rocky 4 and 5. That being said, it is INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE to see Mr. Stallone recapture the magic of the first Rocky films with this final installment. Rocky Balboa (6) returns us to a movie that is based on STORY and CHARACTER. It is a fine piece of work that doesn't rely on long training sequences and corny scenes. Stallone has delivered a heartfelt piece that is defined by the story and enhanced by the fight. Sly, if you bother to read any of this, I commend you on Rocky's final bow. You did it with style, heart and class and I cannot wait to see it again. Thank you for creating one of the best movie characters of all time, and treating us all to a gem of a closer.",Rocky Balboa

778,akeod99,It was the perfect ending to the Rocky character,10,22 December 2006,"I went and saw this movie opening night and came away completely satisfied and impressed! I have long been a Rocky fan, even though some of the movies missed the boat on the Rocky character shown in the first movie. This movie went back to the roots of who Rocky is and was, and was a perfect conclusion to the character, Rocky Balboa. The movie wasn't about the last fight. It was an ending to a character we've watched since the 70s. Sly was effective in portraying the part and giving fans an ending to the story. The movie was passionate, and the essence that made fans cheer for the Rocky character was brought back. The movie was great, but I also knew there would never be another movie, so after the movie was over, there was almost a bitter sweet feeling. It was an amazing ending to the Rocky story. GO SEE THE MOVIE! Well done, Stallone!",Rocky Balboa
779,Miamidolphinspimp,A great ending to a great series,10,22 December 2006,The rocky series hit a brick wall when it made rocky 5. The end result of Rocky 5 wasn't what the average fan wanted in a movie series that had been such a success. Rocky Balboa really solidified Rocky as one of the best sporting/drama series collections of all time. If you are borderline on whether or not to watch this film i would suggest seeing it. I finally feel that the series can come to an end. The previous movie left you with the feeling of wanting more. Rocky Balboa is a good story that end the fighting career of fictional legend in the boxing world. The movie was made with the utmost class and practicality. In conclusion if you enjoyed the rocky collection you should really go and see this movie. It's ending finally makes sense.,Rocky Balboa
780,abeauty1102,Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to others especially die hard Balboa fans!!,8,22 December 2006,"I have always been a Rocky Balboa fan but, when I heard part 6 was coming out, I thought it was going to be cheesy. Turns out I really enjoyed this movie. I thought Pauly played his character like he always does. For some strange reason he was my favorite character in the movie.I missed Adrian though!! Rocky I thought was pretty funny and a bit different, he was a lot more emotional in this movie and laid back. Also Rocky and Pauly are real close in this movie, they have a strong bond. It would of been a bit better if the son and Rocky had that bond. One thing that kind of got me was it didn't seem real with the whole father and son situation. They should of followed more closely to their relationship. It was also sad because I am so use to seeing Adrian and Rocky together and since they weren't together in this movie, it made it very sentimental. Rocky's component also kept the movie interesting. I think it would of been a little better if maybe they would of got more involved with his character. My boyfriend and brother enjoyed this movie as well.I feel I would recommend this movie to others, especially die hard Balboa fans.This movie was entertaining and sentimental. I wish I could of been in the crowd at the end of the movie shouting,""ROCKY""!!",Rocky Balboa
781,yelisbilim,Portrays the human heart and soul!!,10,22 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa is A movie that sheds a light to all of us, in our everyday lives, right into our hearts. His story reflects the human heart and the life-process and crisis that we all go through. Personally i think that Sylvester Stallone IS Rocky Balboa and he is one of the best role-models that's ever appeared on screen. It feels like Stallone was meant to be Rocky and there for he did not succeed as well in other projects. This only states the fact that his heart was where his own beliefs were, just like Rocky. It also proves that everybody has a place in the world and it is not about being famous or about making money, it is about finding that place and stick with it, no matter how hard it can be to follow the road of ones heart.The simplicity and dogmatic feel that the first film had to it, was according to me, once again portrayed and that is one of the things that makes it great to watch. The feeling of almost filming everyday life and ''ordinary'' people is beautiful. To me and to many other people out there Rocky (and Stallone)is a tremendous inspiration. Everyone can relate to him and even if one doesn't make a living as a boxer, everyone needs to be a fighter. Stallone is a fighter, and has great courage to pursue his dreams, especially since his failures in his career has been, i think, tough to take. He inspires us all to find the fighter within ourselves and have the guts to set it free.I recommend everyone with a cold heart to see this movie, since i believe that there is here, a chance to warm it up.....",Rocky Balboa

Though there were a few mistakes, like in Balboa record, the movie was heartfelt and excellent. Balboa stayed true to Adrian throughout this movie and went on as a humorous, just normal guy with respect and manners. Out of all the movies, I think this movie is at rank with the first movie. I really loved it. Just an overall great ending for all of the Rocky movies. He went out with pride and dignity with his reputation at it's all time high. Will watch over again. It definitely surpassed my expectations on the film. Will recommend all Rocky fans to see it. A great watch.",Rocky Balboa

Rocky Balboa , the movie for the most part is expected. No real surprises. However there is more emotion than action here than anywhere else (1-5).The things that I did not like about the movie are obviously the lack of any groundbreaking soundtrack and a short training montage (I love the training scenes in 3 and 4). Im also glad to see Tony Burton and Burt Young back in the movie. Would have been nice to see Adrian (BTW The Adiran mourning scenes are very moving ....)Finally, Stallone is a real inspiration - as himself and Rocky.I really enjoyed the movie and I'm sure you will too.

Within two minutes you're hit with the equivalent of an emotional right jab and you know in your gut that it's on. Like his beloved fictional hero, Stallone's not going to back down. He's going to give you everything he has in this film, and God love him, he does. By the end, you're emotionally spent and beaten, but you're a better human for it.I have been a Rocky fan since I was a kid. The first one still always chokes me up. This last one made me weep.

787,orange_tk2004,Rocky Balboa,9,23 December 2006,"If, like most of America, you have become wary of the Rocky series, due to a perceived increase in mediocrity with each film, understand the following:Rocky is an undeniable classic, a stand-alone film that earned Academy Awards... Rocky II is continuation, a film that works in combination with the original to complete an original story... Rocky III is a substantiation, a film that seeks to legitimate Rocky's world title... Rocky IV, while oozing a propagandic tone, is an apex of the series in which Rocky has climbed to the point that he has not much left to prove as a fighter or as a character... Rocky V is a falling action, in which, from the great heights, the character and the story must receive their natural (though I assume less than intended, at the time) decline.......Which brings us to our present topic: Rocky Balboa... True, we can imagine Rocky is simply an original classic and hope to ignore the subsequent series... If we watch each subsequent film separately, as an individual work, we lose sight of the story as a whole... and slight ourselves into perceiving each film as a lesser work... But we cannot, for we know that the story rolls on, like life, sometimes brilliant, sometimes not... If we are to stop at V (as was originally intended), then we are hard pressed to reconcile the falling plot and characters to ourselves, with the memory of the overwhelmingly classic original. However... we must no longer stop at V... We now have a final chapter to this silver screen novel, and our second classic.Rocky Balboa completes a classic film series, a series about life. Watch Rocky... Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, and Rocky V... And THEN... see Rocky Balboa... This is the only film this year... and the only film I have ever seen... that not only creates in itself a classic, but serves also to masterfully raise up the previous films so that the entire series can stand on high ground. Higher now, perhaps, than any other film series... Jaws? Back to the Future? Star Trek? Star Wars? Bond? The Godfather? Which of these can claim to be a sound body of work through and through because of its final chapter? Is the series simply a collection of brilliant films? No it is not. But neither is life. And Rocky Balboa is a film about life, not a film about great films. Watch I - V... Then see Balboa... Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I'm wrong.",Rocky Balboa

While viewing the advanced screening in the US, we did not know what to expect ! We walked out and felt for once in years that we have seen a great movie with powerful acting and a script that was well written. A huge thumbs up goes out to everyone who was involved in this film and most of all we give our big thanks to Sly Stallone who proved that he can give a world class performance ! The acting was emotional and I just wished actors of today could give similar performances ! For reviewers/critics who have given this movie negative comments, then you must be on a different planet !!! You obviously have not seen many movies to give a proper review. There is a lot of rubbish out there and it's not very often a decent movie comes out well worth waiting to see ! Stallone's performance was excellent !

I thought to myself (and like many other people) when i heard of another Rocky movie, how the hell can he do another. He is to old!! How is the story gonna go? Another comeback Rocky movie? Not here!

This movie made me want to jump out of my seat, there was definitely suspense. By far, one of my new favorite movies! It's hard for me to not think of Rocky as an actual person, he is just a character. After I saw the movie I played the Rocky theme song about 30 times dancing around. Rocky has made me become more ambitious and it has made me want to reach all my goals. If Rocky can do it as an old man, so can I! I recommend everyone who has seen the previous movies to watch this one. Without a doubt, I vote 10 out of 10 for this movie!",Rocky Balboa
791,annobutterworth,Don't judge Stallone by his age. Rocky Balboa rocks!,9,23 December 2006,"I didn't even know that another Rocky movie was coming out until I was at the movie theater looking for a movie to watch. The fact that Rocky Balboa was not really advertised on television worried me, in addition to the fact that it appeared to be another overdone sequel. However, as a devoted Rocky sentimentalist, I find Rocky to be very nostalgic. It brings back memories of watching it with my father as a child. Let's just say...""It ain't over till it's over."" Rocky Balboa is extremely well written, the acting is great, and, most importantly, it remains true to the older Rocky movies. A small portion of the original cast is in the new Balboa movie. Now some may automatically criticize Stallone's age and feel that it is unrealistic for a late 50 something-early 60ish man to be fighting in the boxing ring. You'll be happy to know that Stallone's age is a major point within the movie. Stallone's age is not glamorized or sugarcoated. In fact, the ""new,"" older Rocky is depicted as being weathered and aged. Yet, his experience and passion for boxing ultimately drives him back into the ring. There is sense of closure for Rocky Fans and the ending is significantly better than the last Rocky movie where he was mentoring an upcoming boxing star. I would recommend Rocky Balboa for anyone who enjoys the previous Rocky films, any one who is an admirer of Sylvester Stallone, or anyone who looking for a well done movie about an older man coming to terms with the idea that his boxing days are soon numbered.",Rocky Balboa
792,richcyrs,Ambitious letdown,6,23 December 2006,"""It ain't over till it's over!"", says a nearly 60 year old Rocky to his much, much younger opponent Mason ""Line"" Dixon in the 6th and most likely final installment of the Rocky series. No it ain't over, though it should be after this film. Rocky Balboa the film ties up every loose end in Rocky's life from a now dead Adrian to his fully grown son that is forced to live in the shadow of his father. Rocky tackles several subplots with an uppercut of righteousness and at least 4 inspirational speeches. He inspires a street thug, gives an old opponent free meals at his restaurant, saves an old dog, replaces a blown light bulb, wins back his bitter son, and after being rejected from receiving a boxing license he refreshes us with a lesson about the American dream and convinces a committee to award him his license. Yes there seemingly is nothing that Rocky Balboa can't do in this film. Sylvester Stallone pulls every cheap, sappy gimmick in the book to make us feel bad for and love Rocky and it eventually starts to work. The promise of a great fight allows us to bear the attack of clichés that make up the first hour and fifteen minutes of the film. We sit there and wait for the great music, the training montage, and then yes , the fight! We watch as Rocky nearly snaps his back lifting weights and we think, ""He can't possibly win, can he?"" The debate that rages in our brains is a battle between common sense and the fantasy that is Rocky. Not since the first Rocky has he actually been an underdog, Stallone makes us actually worry for his wellbeing. Rocky feels out of place throughout the movie, standing up for a long forgotten sense of good! This cynical world has left him behind but Rocky doesn't know this and therefore he is able to still fight. He enters the massive Las Vegas arena and says, ""Imagine having to clean this place?"" His priorities have changed, but Rocky still possesses that dumb charm that won our hearts in the first film. Overall Rocky Balboa falls flat, with too many moments intended to inspire that just feel forced, and an overly edited fight that hides the impact of the punches and therefore removes all drama and danger. The film's strongest moments come when Rocky isn't lifting a weight, punching an opponent, or giving a lecture on the importance of a good dog name, it's when Rocky is being himself. It's the sincerity of a man that means well but doesn't quite know the right words to say that makes Rocky a great character. It's the pain we feel for Rocky as he describes in an almost inaudible rant how he misses his dead wife and that there's something deep inside him that has to get out one last time. This movie lacks a lot of things but it certainly has heart, it was made with honesty and love! How many sequels can honestly say that?",Rocky Balboa
793,expandingseconds,Stallone Did a Great Job,10,24 December 2006,"I'm giving this a 10 for both the film's own merits and what Stallone had marshal to even get it all to go--and go as greatly as it did. It could have been average. It could definitely have been disastrous. But the man did it. Rocky came back for people. Saw the first Rocky tonight before seeing Rocky Balboa a second time; though it's not necessary to do the following to enjoy this film, I think revisiting the first one, as well as reading reviews (even negative ones . . . even by reviewers who seem to be arguing that the human heart is a mathematical equation) and checking interviews with Stallone would definitely enhance first viewing. I didn't do all these things before my first visit with it, and I still wanted to see it again right when it was done on 12-20 (saw it again tonight (12-23). For next to no budget, you get a great script, good acting all around, some classic shots, chills, suspense, and another memorable training scene and fight. The genuine heart--manifested in the film and in his interviews--that comes out of Stallone is moving. I find a lot of the critiques of it to be cynical and off base. With the focus being so much on Rocky, it's not about Stallone indulging himself--it's about really looking at Rocky himself as a means of conveying struggle with haunting history, ineffable burns inside, and saying goodbye. And people knocking it as if they've seen it but haven't, w e l l dot dot dot Go for it. Take friends. Take family. Get inspired. I hope you dig it as much as I did.",Rocky Balboa
794,par-karunakaran,Brilliant...,8,24 December 2006,"This one definitely made my top 3 movies of the year. Let me add that i am a little biased on this one being a huge Stallone fan. But on a neutral standing i'd still give it a 7/10 if you have seen rocky then its a 9/10. I watched it just so that i could say i was right , that Stallone was off his rocker to make another sequel after part 4(which was just plain bad as far as i'm concerned) and part 5(which ruined the rocky series).... but i kept wishing for a good ending, after all the original was brilliant and i wanted to see the series end in a good way.... Rocky 6 just made me a Stallone fan again.Definite must see for anyone who has seen the original, Stallone's direction has improved though its not brilliant he manages to keep hold our attention throughout the movie. And though the ending of the movie is never in question the way the story is narrated and the style in which the characters are reintroduced to us makes it (for the lack of another more appropriate word) nostalgic. To be reminded of what the original movie was about and what it meant to people like me is what made Stallone such a big star... now almost like starting back at the beginning Stallone in the twilight of his career(before this movie) comes up with another brilliant performance(unlike his direction his performance is brilliant as rocky and you end up rooting for rocky once again by the end of the movie). Its obvious that he's taken some ideas from the TV show he produced but its used in a very effective way, the well choreographed fights the rebuilding of the story, the depiction of the characters.... especially Paulie just catches you off guard. overall these are my views : Is the movie worth watching ? Definitely YES. Is it the best movie of the year? no Is it Stallone's comeback? maybe . but he's on my favorites list again",Rocky Balboa
795,murdock1908,Welcome To Rockyland,10,27 December 2006,"""Welcome to Rockyland"" That is the quote the announcer says in the 2nd round break. He is not right, he should have said: ""Welcome back to Rockyland, Sylvester"" I never was much of a Stalone fan. I actually have only partially liked the previous Rockys. I never considered him as a real actor, more of an action entertainer. But ""Rocky Balboa"" is not really an action movie. It's a man's struggle with his own daemons, and a true example to those who give up easily.Sylvester had a big slump in the last... decade or so. But, as so poetically was put in ""For love of the game"" by the commentator, ""he managed to push back the clouds, and get one more day in the sunshine"" Stalone turned me to a fan with this movie. I just hope he can get just one more day in the sunshine, one more great role like this one, and maybe retire with the pride he deserves.At least he started playing roles closer to his age. That is huge for a guy like Stalone, because you don't expect a man like him to stop fighting time. But in his case time caught him up, and stood still.I'm almost certain that this movie will be how we will remember Stalone. It is the first movie he showed acting potential, and in my humble opinion, this movie is his own story. He had to kill the beast inside him so that he can move forward.Sly killed the beast alright, but in the process he found a new self, a new actor...""Welcome to Rockyland"", Welcome back Sylvester!",Rocky Balboa

I think that through Rocky Balboa many underdogs have a chance to see that they can do something in life. It is a message to all of them that they can achieve great things if they work hard and believe in themselves. The cast is great. Sly has done a great job with picking a true former boxing champion to play Rocky's opponent.Ithink that everybody should see this movie because it is great. I am expecting a lot. And i know that i will not end up disappointed.",Rocky Balboa
797,larrz-1,Great movie left on the editing room floor,6,24 December 2006,"Rocky's back and it's... well, okay. Like most people in my audience, we wanted to love this movie and see one of American cinema's great characters again. We were mildly disappointed. Why? The Rocky storyline is old and well-worn. What had more potential was the side stories: Rock's son struggle with his father's fame and his identity, Paulie's story - his life of regrets with no ability to see a future after he is pink slipped; The bar maid Marie and her son - and how Rocky inspired each of them. But each of those story lines went nowhere. This made for a one dimensional film with too many loose ends. I'm pretty sure,Stallone wrote and filmed these story lines but the studio pinheads probably forced him to cut this material. This is a shame because, at least to me, Rocky has been about how others react to and find their inner courage and strength from Rocky. I'm waiting for the DVD.",Rocky Balboa

799,sonysrai,Idea for the Rocky Balboa DVD,10,25 December 2006,"The movie was great. It gave me more fuel for the fire inside. All I ask is that when the DVD comes out will you please create a ""Philosophy by Rocky"" because he says some of the most enlightening things. I thank you for that Sly.I loved it in the film where were you were in the cemetery and all you could see was Rian Boa, it made my think of a Rainbow. I've watch all the movies many times, sometimes films are the only thing you can relate to in your life. Rocky was a huge part of my young life. Still is and he went out a champion.Sunny Rai",Rocky Balboa
800,adamix13,Unbelievably great film!!!!!,10,25 December 2006,"I cannot believe what Sylvester Stallone managed... I am probably the biggest fan of Rocky Balboa. I watched all of the films uncountable times, and it has helped me through life.When i just think of the film a fire in me starts to burn. Rocky Balboa is a idol that should be remembered. He manages to get a draw even though he is very old and has a young and powerful opposition.Rocky unleashes ˝the beast˝ from inside. This is a very common factor in almost each and everyone of us. Not many have the chance to release the beast inside. I just CANNOT believe how he managed to get all the real life guys in there, the referee, ring call-man, Mike Tyson, etc. The film is the best, it connects to the first part, with everything, Back to the Roots.The best thing i find from the film is, the dedication to something, his heart and soul to win and survive in this cruel world. I find this most inspiring : It ain't about how hard you can hit, its about how hard you can get hit, and still keep moving! Trust me i have all kinds of problems, and i appreciate everything i have. I love Rockys hospitality, friendship, he is truly a respect-worthy man.Rocky Balboa= Idol of heart, soul, fighting for the right to survive, making new goals and succeeding in achieving them, friendship, respect, and everything else.Rocky Baloba, For Life!",Rocky Balboa
801,konedog4,The Last Rocky Film Wraps Up Series,7,27 December 2006,"Rocky Balboa has much of the flavor of the original Rocky (1976) release. The emphasis is not on the fight, rather, it is on the character of Rocky, and how he is struggling to maintain himself after the death of his beloved Adrian. The first 3/4th of the film is devoted to developing the character of Rocky and his interactions with old and new characters. Th ""old"" characters are Paulie (Adrian's brother), Rocky's son (now a struggling businessman, Spider Rico (a former opponent, and now Rocky's friend and confidant), and ""Little Marie"" a now grown woman who Rocky walked home from a street corner in the original film (Marie was perhaps 12 years old then).I would be remiss not to mention Adrain, as ""Rocky Balboa"" is perhaps a shrine to Adrian. Rocky cannot escape her death, and he spends a great deal of time sitting in a chair beside her grave, bringing her flowers daily, and talking to her.As the film progresses, the current heavyweight champ is beaten in a computer simulated fight with Rocky (in his prime). Since the current champ has something to prove to himself, he is convinced by his handlers to engage Rocky in a publicity-garnering exhibition fight. Rocky accepts the challenge despite the disapproval of his son and Paulie.The fight itself is anti-climactic to the character development of Rocky and where he goes after the fight. Thus, the fight has less drama than the previous Rocky opponents (such as Appolo, Drago, Clubber Lang, etc). Suffice to say that both fighters give it their all in the ring and both achieve what they set out to do.For me it was a very pleasing film, and I give it 3.25 of 4 stars. I think it could have been a bit longer, with further development of Rocky's trainer (who most people do not know who he is - he is Apollo's trainer), and perhaps more on Rocky's training. After all, he is in his late 50's and it is hard to imagine a man at that age stepping into the ring with the champ. Rocky is incredibly ripped in his musculature, but I would have liked to see the same sequence that was done in the first film, showing how out of shape Rocky was, and what he had to go through to get into shape.You will like this film if you can accept the preposition of a man in his late 50's fighting the current champion. If you can get past that, and is credible in your mind, the film works. If you can't accept that preposition, the film can still be enjoyed for the development of the Rocky character, and the hope he has in his future with his son, and Marie as a potential future love interest.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig.",Rocky Balboa
802,marcus_04,Near Tear Dropper,10,27 December 2006,"I have been a major Rocky and Sly Stallone fan for a long time now and I must say that this is the best or one of the best movies that I have seen Sly do.I must say I felt the energy, emotion, and inspiration from the film and I recommend to anyone. Even if you have never seen a Rocky film, this one is as good as the first and that one won best picture.For those people who think that Sly Stallone isn't a good actor, well I say that this movie will make you change your mind some and for those of you who don't want to see it because it sounds ridiculous remember: Don't judge a movie if you haven't seen it.This is a must see film, please go and see this movie, you won't be disappointed because this movie and character has an effect on every person.",Rocky Balboa
803,herzlich,"awful movie, very slow bad writing and filming",1,26 December 2006,"not sure where all of you people are coming from with your comments, but im not sure if you saw a different movie than i did. i feel like i just wasted almost 2 hrs of my life watching a poorly made film with terrible writing and almost as bad acting. there was no point in this movie. you all say it was inspirational? for what to go do something you were once good at? he didn't even have a reason for it he just had a ""feeling"". there was no plot other than to show he can fight one more time which didn't happen until the last 10 minutes or so of the movie. the whole movie was soooooooo slow to develop and didn't keep me interested at all. when something finally happened it sucked. the cinematography and all the black and white and flashbacks and crazy colors during the fight was very unnecessary and added nothing to the movie. didn't make me feel more excited for rocky or interested to see what the outcome of the fight would be. you guys all need to watch this movie again or get your heads checked out. this movie was really bad.",Rocky Balboa
804,odlegend,Awesome,9,26 December 2006,"I thought this movie was awesome. I loved it. The script was very good. It was much better than Rocky 5. I think if they went from Rocky 4 to Rocky Balboa and never made Rocky 5-the series would be much better. This does make up for Rocky 5 and it leaves you wanting a Rocky 7 (even though that will never happen)! The ending was a little predictable for the die-hard Rocky fans (that is why I gave it a 9). However, the story does make it believable. Sylvester Stallone did a great job. He is still an incredible actor! Rocky is like a fine wine-it gets better with age! Rocky is just as good in 2006 as in 1976! See this movie! I plan to see this movie again before it leaves the theater-it is that good!",Rocky Balboa
805,kjgoode-1,Rocky Balboa is a KNOCKOUT,10,26 December 2006,"I am a huge Rocky fan, so I could not wait to see this movie. I loved how this movie tied in several details from the 1st Rocky. I would suggest that you watch Rocky before going to see Rocky Balboa, unless you have seen it a 1000 times like me. Rocky Balboa was great from start to finish, and well worth the cost of admission. I would have a hard time rating where it falls in the Rocky series, again because I am such a huge fan of all, and because it has not had time to grow on me like the others. If I had to put it in order I would say: RockyII, Rocky, Rocky Balboa, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V. Rocky V would be last, but the others could be in any order. Anyway GO SEE ROCKY BALBOA, it was EXCELLENT!!",Rocky Balboa
806,compact_error,"The perfect ending to an epic, modern story",10,27 December 2006,"This flick deserves a 10 for one very valid reason: this is the last installment in a long line of sequels to Rocky. That being said, we all know that they don't measure up to the original, even if II and III had some moments that really brought you back to part I. IV and V were just terrible, I couldn't even believe they were supposed to happen in the Rocky time line. Though the director of Rocky came back to do part V, that by no means makes it feel as close to the original in anyway.When I heard that Sly was doing part VI, a wave of disgust washed over me simply because they'd gotten so bad; part I seemed like it was so far away and all of the sequels lost the snowball effect the farther the story was pulled along.The trailers for Rocky Balboa surprised many of us because they were so promising of a GOOD movie. I decided that even though the trailers were well cut and DID present a decent flick, I'd keep my distance and not bother getting excited... because, as we all know, the sequels seriously plague the great and forgotten first picture.When I came out of the cinema on opening day, I could not believe that Sly pulled it off; he'd brought heart back into Rocky and pushed the character through the same arc as the original flick.As far as I'm concerned, Rocky Balboa is a great final installment and easily the most faithful sequel to the original Rocky. The terrible in-between movies were worth the wait to get this mature and well made film.",Rocky Balboa

If you are or ever were a Rocky fan, YOU MUST GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm not sure how Sly did it, but all I know is I left this movie feeling good. All told, this movie will not win any awards for its acting, writing, or direction. But toss out all that meaningless junk, because you will absolutely love this movie anyway! Simply toss out and forget Rocky V, and insert this movie in its place. Thank God Rocky V stunk, or this movie may never have been made. Balboa marks a perfect end for this series.

809,sales-796,"Flawed, devoid, dull and boring... Shame on you Stallone !!!",4,29 December 2006,"This has to be the biggest let down that I have ever felt. I was soooo looking forward to this movie. Immediately after watching it I felt so let down. There's the brain damage issue from 5 which I found was not dealt with in the movie. There's the issue of Balboa's son looking the same age as Maries son which is absolutely ridiculous. I found it slow, dull, boring and devoid. The montage was extremely short and very monotonous (that's the same for people who don't know). The fight was filmed in PPV digital style which I disliked. It seemed as though someone had performed a survey of all the things that people remembered and liked from the previous movies, and tried to fit them all into this one, like the crushing blow that sends Balboa hurtling down the side of the ropes, almost falling over but managing to get up, the Mickey shot in the corner and the double knockdown in 1 round. Also didn't like the Raging Bull black and white rip off shots. It was riddled with crude sponsorship deals which Paulie conveniently covered with his tag line from the restaurant entrance. This wasn't the case with the other movies. Flawed beyond imagination is the only thing that I can say. A real disappointment, and possibly a sinister echo of what the new Rambo may be like. Maybe this is a wind down for Stallone before he takes his retirement. A shame to go out this way.",Rocky Balboa

The acting was great, The message inside the movie is reachable , the fight scene was fantastic..It is really touching the heart and soul . The scene when Rocko cries described his suffering after Adrean's death and the amount of pain that was left inside of him . when the fight started, you feel the beast inside Rocky arises He fights to release the pain inside of him and to overcome the pain of the years .For those who didn't see that movie, Please go and see it ..

811,finessedfilms,Best Heavy Weight Fight in Ages!,10,29 December 2006,"This installment of the Rocky series is excellent and had me on the edge of my seat throughout. There were all the classic components to a great movie and a strong story line that held it all together. As a fan of the sport of boxing, especially in the heavyweight category, I could not help but shout aloud when Rocky got down to business. The flashback aspect was surreal and kept us rooted into the history of this wonderful boxing champion. But the emotion that ran through this prompted a grown man to tears. Your expectations will not go unmet and if a fan, or even if not - you will rejoice! From start to finish I found myself rooting for Rocky, in his new life, in his relationship with his son, and in his reliving of the past. This is touching, stirring, motivational, and as Rocky has always been, extremely inspirational. You will leave the theater wanting more. Some may say this is a last hoorah for Stallone, but it is actually a masterpiece and a segment of this story, this saga, that had to be told! My perspective is that of a female fan. But I know that the guys will relate in much the same way. Mine did! He loved it. I could see it again!",Rocky Balboa
812,dhanono,"Rocky Balboa rocks, great messages",10,29 December 2006,"Just saw the movie. I grew up watching Rocky movies and this one ranks way up there. Great messages, a must see very inspirational. I think we can all identify with Rocky, from being told what we can and cannot do. We should all take a lesson and learn that with heart and passion we can do or achieve whatever we set out to do. The critics say that the movie starts out slow and tries to take you back with cliché spots from the old movies. I totally disagree. I believe the movie begins and ends perfectly. The first beginning of the movie is setting you up for all that you can learn from the outcome. Great writing by Stallone, great music a must see. The fact that Adrian is not written into the movie is not a draw back since most of the movie hinges on her memory and what she meant to him.",Rocky Balboa
813,hugo-182,One of the best Rocky movies,10,1 January 2007,I think that this film truly is one of the best Rocky movies in the series. It have the old magic from Rocky I-IV which we all missed in Rocky V. Sly is Playing fantastic and you can see how he loves playing Rocky again. And Of course the fight is fantastic and has the drama that it should have to be a Rocky fight. I already love this movie as much as I love the others. I grew up watching the first five Rocky movies and I am really glad that the last film now has come. It also makes the fifth movie more acceptable than it has been until now. I think that the only thing wrong with Rocky V was that he didn't fought in the ring against Tommy Gunn. But as far as Rocky Balboa goes: 10 stars out of 10 from me,Rocky Balboa
814,Shalnar,"If you have seen the rest, read this",8,31 December 2006,"I've grown up with Rocky, and I'm sorry, but when I heard that Stallone was making another movie, I had to roll my eyes. However, I've seen every movie and I wasn't about to let this one slide.Let me start off with saying this, the movie is slow to pick up. You can see the ending a mile away, and you can definitely tell that Stallone has aged. If you have never seen a Rocky movie, then skip this one.However, if you have, the fight still gave me chills, and the hits still hurt me bad. I like the movie, and I applaud how well it has been done. This is a great farewell to Rocky, and a good way to END the series. It didn't pack as much punch as the times when he fought Apollo Creed, or laid out good old Mr T. But it did make me want to get up and throw punches to ""Eye of the Tiger"" one more time and inspire me to buy the movies.To sum it up, if you've seen the others, and you are a Rocky fan, see the movie. If you haven't, skip it and rent it at home. Good movie, just not worth the huge box office price if you don't know what you are getting into.",Rocky Balboa
815,sammysultan,"Rocky Balboa, a great finale!!!",10,31 December 2006,"I thought this film was superb, a true testimony to the man who has made the whole series. The tragedy of Rockys wife, coupled with his sons inability to emulate or even cope with his fathers fame was brilliantly portrayed. These the two factors, which, culminated in him picking up the gloves again in an attempt to release the ""beast"" which plagued him. Typically, in true rocky style, he even had to battle against the sports tribunal, who were opposed to him otaining the boxing liscense. From then on, its classy Rocky, only this time; he is the real underdog, fighting an opponent who although he has reached the pinnacle of the heavyweight game, has lost all respect in the public eye. I got shivers down my spine watching it.",Rocky Balboa
816,barclayn71,If you have not seen this movie go see it.,10,31 December 2006,We could discuss what the point is on having another Rocky movie. When I first I heard about this movie being in the works that is the first thing that came to my mind. I wondered what was left after Rocky V. Let's face it that movie was not a very good way to end a series like Rocky but I was afraid for what they would do next. Now that I have seen Rocky Balboa I can say that I was right. Rocky V was not a good way to end the series and I am glad that Stallone decided that he had one more Rocky movie in him. Rocky Balboa is a great way to end this series on a high note. The movie ends up being not only a lot of fun but it also manages to be inspiring. It had the same grab that the first movie had if not more. If you have ever given yourself an excuse why not to do something then go see this movie and see if you can't come up with reasons why you should do something now.,Rocky Balboa
817,awake-9,unexpected surprise,10,1 January 2007,"This movie was an unexpected new year surprise. The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, but once it took off; it was terrific. I loved seeing the old Rocky movie clips.I loved the scenes that were shown at the end of the movie of all the different people climbing the ""Rocky"" steps. This said to me we can all get out there and try to do what we think we should be doing; we may not win, but we can at least try and not sit on the sidelines wondering ""what if?"". This movie was inspirational and you left the theater feeling terrific! Rocky Balboa compared with the other holiday film of an underdog making good (the pursuit of happiness) is a 100 times better. It is a shame that it has not received as much pre-release publicity as other holiday movies. I hope word of mouth sends people going to see this movie.

Anyway, I like this Rocky the best of all of them. But Only because it ends the saga in a way as if he's growing old as we are. I really connected with his way of portraying a kind of silent fear of aging and being alone. I noticed the same type of thing in my dad before he died. I could tell he didn't want to give up fighting and that he didn't want to get old. This is a really good movie and it concludes the Rocky series in the best way I could think of.

The thing I like best about this movie is that the fight sequence is filmed in a realistic manners (definitely a departure from the franchise), as though Rocky and Dixon were actually sparring and they had an ESPN crew there filming it live. The first half of the movie is almost too sappy to stand, but it's still perfect thanks to the fact that it's a ROCKY MOVIE. The movie really only has two acts; pre-fight and fight. There may be a disappointing lack of montages, but it's still Rocky, so who cares.My early prediction for this movie was that he would win the fight, but he would die afterwards. I was also hoping for a KO, but Rocky still goes out with class, and I guess if you're like him and Pauly, that's all that matters.",Rocky Balboa
821,kingali_18,Rocky VI the best rocky yet?,9,2 January 2007,"I'v been lucky enough to see rocky 6, and wasn't disappointed! I don't think it matches up to the previous Rocky's such as rocky 2 and 3 which are my favourite. And Rocky's training scenes are too short and lacks the will to make you run down and use your gym membership for the second time in three years! The acting and cast is superb, the characters seem realistic. The movie focuses on Rocky's life after boxing, rocky 6 is the more emotional movie out of the rocky anthology, it is very funny and sad at times. But i thought the best part of the movie is the fighting scenes near the end, it is truly incredible and well directed. Stallone is in such good shape for 60! When you think the fighting will be calmer less powerful, you are proved wrong when the fighting heats up. having a real boxer to fight rocky makes the fighting scenes better than any other rocky film! You will not be disappointed with this film if you are looking for a deep hearted and emotional movie or an action extravaganza! Rocky balboa is a must see for 2007!",Rocky Balboa

Now, I was able to introduce my son to Rocky! He enjoyed the movie so much, that afterwords I had to go buy the other Rocky movies, that I did not already own, for us to watch together. He is still humming the tune to Rocky and saying ""ROCKY BALBOA"" over and over. This movie was excellent! We all laughed, cried, and cheered during it. It was as if we were at the match.

Just a thought . . .It's a shame I have to bore you with more to fill my 10-line-minimum quota to be allowed to post.

I think baby boomers can relate to this film and all of us who are younger get a peek into what we might experience in our future. Robert Jr is a guy still trying to find his way and Steps is a kid in need of direction and although this film is about Rocky and his journey it shows how he affects their lives. I was expecting a puff piece about an over the hill boxer coming out of retirement, but this movie was a life lesson while still being entertaining.The flashbacks brang tears to my eyes, the fight is amazing, I was not ready for the movie to end. Yo Sly, you did it!",Rocky Balboa
826,jayblais,What movies are supposed to be!!!,10,5 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa delivered what every movie dreams to... connection with the audience. Very few movies are successful at generating empathy from the audience, but Rocky Balboa NAILS it! Emotion, excitement, passion, hope, frustration, and caring. A total roller coaster and an achievement for Sly Stallone. What a great way to close the door on Rocky. I will definitely be adding Rocky, Rocky II, and Rocky Balboa to my collection, for a truly great trilogy. If only every movie left the viewers feeling uplifted, excited, and empowered in their lives... Well, as John Lennon wrote- Imagine...As for more in depth analysis, the first scene scared me, I thought it was a little cheesy and seemed a bit awkward. I was not sure what to expect from this last installment, but the first scene had me ready to be disappointed. Ten minutes later, though, I was all in. The mix of flashbacks and current day emotions causing the turmoil and anxiety of Rock, came across as genuine and true. It carries this movie, which spend very very little time on the actual fighting.",Rocky Balboa
827,marlonwalker,The film was great and a well done completion to the story.,9,5 January 2007,"I personally enjoyed the film. I did notice that it slowed down toward the middle, but that can be expected at times. For the last several years (especially after I became aware of the film's production) I had asked myself the question ""If Rocky Balboa ever got the chance to get in the ring to compete in today's version of professional boxing, how would he fare?"" This film more than adequately answered that question for me. I was thoroughly impressed with the HBO PPV presentation of the event. I legitimately felt like I was watching a PPV fight via satellite, and the auditorium was dead silent. For fans of the character this is a must see. For curious onlookers, you should give it a shot. For boxing fans, enough said. Stallone put in work to prepare, Burt Young was as great as ever, and Rocky has officially passed on to the next phase. Great journey and I have enjoyed the ride!",Rocky Balboa
828,griffse,Everyone should see this!,10,5 January 2007,"Pros:Not about boxing, about self and accountability. Sly really delivers as an actor in this film. The scene outside the restaurant with his son is stunning and brilliantly done. The scene with Paulie at the meat plant is almost as good, I was blown away. I couldn't believe how caught up I was in the acting instead of the typical training/fight aspect. My wife has never seen a rocky movie and dislikes ""guy"" movies; she loved it! Rocky is an American Icon, thank you Mr. Stallone for sharing him with us. I felt my throat get a little choked up right as the film wound down, You could tell it was the end of an era.Cons: The camera work is somewhat goofy, especially during the fight. The development of the lesser known characters is poor. Some could argue that there is a ""typical"" underdog element, but it is a Rocky film.",Rocky Balboa
829,henri_soccer2005,This movie is simply amazing! Way better than the first Rocky!,10,5 January 2007,"The previous Rocky movies have inspired me and I am proud to say that ""Rocky Balboa"" is amazing. The actors do a terrific job and Sylvester Stallone is in an incredible shape.I really liked the fight scene. I would have liked it if Rocky won instead the match because when he says ""I didn't come to Vegas to lose"" it means that he is determined to win, so basically him losing means that his dream is crushed, but still Dixon has much respect for him in the end, and so does Rocky. Overall the movie was very emotional from the beginning to the end. Sylvester Stallone did an amazing job at bringing back this character in the big screen. Thumbs way up for the movie!",Rocky Balboa
830,ossiman82,Yo Sly,10,6 January 2007,"I have to say that that this last Rocky movie was great. I have been a Rocky fan when I saw the first Rocky movie. I think we all can identify our selves a little bit in Rocky's character. By this I mean that we all can feel the same burning sensation in our hearts when we feel that we should do something right that we want to do, even tough it sounds ridiculous to our selves or others. Only many of us can't do it like Rocky, because the fear or our made up reasons are too powerful for our guts to go trough with it. Eventough Rocky movies are fictional and the fights we have seen seem impossible and even funny, especially in Rocky IV, I give my gratitude and respect to Mr. Stallone for making Rocky movies with guts. I think Mr. Stallone has made Rocky movies with the same burning heart we have seen in Rocky's character. Even that now Sly is 60 years old, he has proved me that his heart is still burning. You did it Sylvester! Best lines in movie: ""You've some calcium deposits in your joints and knees so sparring is out... Let's start building some HURTING BOMBS!"" ""It is not about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward."" From huge Rocky fan of Finland. Ossi",Rocky Balboa
831,stephen-stockwell-1,Rocky Balboa is a Movie not to miss,9,8 January 2007,"Now I will say I was a skeptical about seeing this movie especially since I was only 9 when the last movie came out. When I did go to the theater I was planning to see this movie for about 3 or 4 months by then. It was worth the wait and out of every single time I have ever been to the movie theater it was the only time I've EVER HEARD 100+ PEOPLE CLAPPING, SCREAMING AND STANDING in a movie theater. It's like it took people back when hope and the dreams of the smaller people mattered. It was brought out through these series of movies. I guess people looked at it like they always understood where Rock was coming from and a sense of familiarness. Maybe a movie but, movies are something you watch at Theaters or T.V. When it affects people and the way they live it is not a movie. Rocky Balboa is a full circle end to what Rocky the Movie has started from. Bravo, plenty to be proud of here. Great story, Paulie makes sure the dialog is never dull. Although its not a 10 I gave it a 9 because of the effort to make sure that the age was in there to make it realistic dealing with middle age, dealing with the loss of a loved one, what time can do to a person and the challenge to get back in the saddle for one more round. But I will say it was border line 10 or 9. It's a movie I'd see again for sure.",Rocky Balboa
832,supertopoyilla,ROCKY BALBOA just for fans!,8,14 June 2007,"I think Rocky Balboa is a movie that is very pleasant for fans. It is focused on every detail: the color of the house, the whole environment in the neighborhood (you are almost smelling the urban breeze) , sounds, even it does not transform or modify the spiritual essence of each character in the story.Rocky Balboa is a character that is already in people's mind. You can talk to anybody and I am sure they will know who Rocky is. You can listen the incidental music, the ""Eye of the tiger"" track, and you establish in your mind immediately to what movie they correspond.This movie is not excellent, but at least it accomplish its duty: Fans are happy again seeing Rocky after 16 years.",Rocky Balboa
833,rickdennie,Great movie if you like Rocky I,9,11 January 2007,"I was expecting very little from this movie as my tastes have changed so much since I was a kid. I really enjoyed Rocky and Rocky IV (I won't even talk about the others). I really feel that this movie accomplished what the first one did, that is, it manages to tell a heart warming story in a way that is believable and not overblown.There are no miracles and no perfect endings, just a true to life journey that allows us to appreciate the Balboa saga and Sylvester Stallone after so many years of disappointments.We don't see a cut and unrealistically built Rocky or a Rocky that couldn't possibly exist in real life. We see a Rocky that that manages to do the impossible on heart and guts which is what made this story so great in the first place.",Rocky Balboa
834,survival_consultants,REAL Computerized SuperFight,9,12 January 2007,"""REAL SuperFight"" Hello, My name is David Woroner. My Father was the creator, producer & director of the original Superfight 1970 between Ali & Marciano. I would first like to thank Mr. Stallone for treating the overall concept of the computerized fight with respect. I applaud you Sir.I do not believe it is a far stretch at all to say that without the original computerized fight, there would have been no vehicle to tell the story as laid out in Rocky Balboa. The Melville Group & Mike DeLisa while having a contract with myself to ""manage the new 2005 Superfight"", does not own the copyright to the original computerized fight that was created by Murry Woroner.I worked equally with Mr. DeLisa to rerelease the new version, that includes a 1 hour documentary. I was listed as everything from Assoc. Producer to Producer depending upon what data base you look at.I am proud to see my Father's work have a resurgence. I also have stated that I believe my Father was the true originator / grandfather of all opponent based computer games. It would have been nice to have seen my Fathers name on the screen, as well as my Mother and finally myself. Because I fought with the LoCongress for two years to acquire my own Father's Film.Bottom line, I hope you enjoyed the film. I hope you will look at the NEW version, its available at amazon and many other outlets.Again, Thank you Mr. Stallone for treating my Fathers memory with respect. You do so by basically emulating the original story and the truest flattery one can bestow is to retell the original story in an updated format.I also believe the film did a fantastic job at bringing the the greatest underdog story of all time to a respectful and meaningful end.

Rocky inspired me throughout my childhood and Rocky V so derailed an otherwise perfect American fairytale story. Well, the fairytale is back. Thank you, Sly! This is the first movie I have seen in 20 years, more than twice in the movie theater (actually I just got home from seeing it my fourth time). It's like a good book that you want to share with all of your friends and I seriously will drag each and everyone of them to the theater one at a time if I have to. This is a very enjoyable movie. Seriously, everyone else has said this already. I don't have much to add here other than my thanks once again to Stallone for fighting to get this movie made the way he wanted it. Bravo! Suspend disbelief folks, this movie is the real McCoy and honestly, I think it's my favorite in the series.",Rocky Balboa
836,gtcjeter2,disappointment,1,13 January 2007,"rocky balboa was a complete disappointment...i think the plot was so boring and it made me want to fall asleep, and the fight wasn't even that good. the fact it was a payperview fight was stupid also the only thing that was even semi good was the when it went black and white and showed the blood that was alright but the rest sucked. Also the hole movie was about how rocky was all upset about adrian dieing, i mean come on rocky get on with ur life don't live in the past, they also could have at least got more indeph about how she died and not had rocky sit at the cemetery for half the damn movie. i hope that stallone can bounce back with his new rambo movie being good cause this was a HUGE letdown!",Rocky Balboa

Now is alone, without Adriana, the son holds the distances because live behind the shadow of the father, and also his friend Paulie feels overwhelmed from the figure of the sister Adriana! So, Rocky has passed to the life trying to be someone for everyone, now he wants to feel someone for him! and it is this its big victory! because at the end of the film they all will win!!! I must say that who is nostalgic like me of all a series and the history of Rocky, this film is full of emotions, to see again all the places of the past, see again the history between Rocky and Adriana, some characters of the past (es: the woman that in the 1st was the girl...) really beautiful! Dense of emotions!!! Memorable then some phrases, and you remember the old episodes! The most famous ""I must break you"" who Rocky says joking to his son! I vote 10, because from rocky you can learn a lot as human, sport and educational that we would have to teach to young people today, by now they lacking in these values! No more to say, but I only recommend to you to go to see it to the cinema! it is the worthy conclusion of his saga! The cinema was full and at the end of the movie all applauded, I never see it before at the cinema!",Rocky Balboa
838,trjordan007,"ROCKY BALBOA...ROCKS....Loved It, please check it.",10,14 January 2007,"I had the privilege recently to see a very inspiring picture. It not only kept me in suspense. It kept me laughing. It had me tearing. It was what a movie is supposed to do. It moved me. I wanted to take my daughters however, they didn't want to see it. Mind you we have the previous movies but this might be the last time we can enjoy something as movie as this. I receive no money for this, but since we all need something to encourage us sometimes. We are all having trials and tribulations to overcome. I believe this is the best movie of all time that starred Sylvester Stallone. Yes I said it. It is ROCKY BALBOA. If you haven't seen it, it is worth seeing. I am 34, the first was shown in 1976. OK I admit I grew up watching him in all of the Rocky movies. And I admit I am a fan for life. But this movie in my book was all of that and a bag of chips. It is something the whole family should enjoy.I love all of the Rocky collection but this was the cherry on top. Definitely worth going to see. You will laugh, cry, cheer and be inspired as I was all over again as a child. Rocky inspired me back then and I am sure he will do the same.I have gotten into debate about this movie with coworkers, but trust me, you will feel like it was worth every penny spent. ROCKY, ROCKY, ROCKY I was sad to see it end.I loved it and I am sure you will too. Some people think once you reach a certain age you lose that zeal or passion for life. In this movie, Sylvester Stallone, was young Rocky all over again, he had that passion, the eye of the tiger and that love for the game. I guess if you love football or basketball you might be able to relate to what I am saying. That passion was there. I was rooting for him throughout the movie, especially in the end. I am so glad he brought it back. I love his work, always have always will. I am just glad to have seen it one last time before he rests those gloves for ever. I want some ROCKY gear. Just like you have Tupac gear everywhere. When will they sale ROCKY gear. I would buy it and I am sure so many other people would too.I loved that move!!!!",Rocky Balboa
839,wdeoliveirajunior,One of the best movies I've ever seen!,10,15 January 2007,"Two Thumbs Up! He did it again! ROCKY BALBOA went the distance once more and is simply superb! Great performances from Sly, Burt Young and Milo Ventmiglia. The unforgettable musical score written by Bill Conti still works as an inspiration. It's amazing! Fantastic! Spetacular! ""The surprise of the season!"" His whole life as a million-to-one shot... But he showed to the whole world he is one in a million. A very good final chapter for the legendary story. This movie is more than just two men punching each other. This is more than just a boxing movie. The spirit of the character is synthesized by Sly in this lines: ""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward."" Enjoy!",Rocky Balboa
840,hazza191,a well,1,22 January 2007,"Well personally i do believe that anybody who is totally fixated with Sylvester Stallone in general most definitely has a problem, and i think that anybody who is as fixated as some of my friends is borderline homosexual. i have seen my three friends go down this one way street over the past three or so weeks. Sylvester Stallone is a brown nose and he shouldn't have the right to act in these films if it is the case that he makes innocent young teenagers become batty boys. in a number of the films he comes across as a person who is so full of himself and he is a all round ***ker. my friends keep coming out with comments that worry me and they are most definitely on the gay road.",Rocky Balboa
841,Cletus-Vanne-Damme,May just be the best Rocky film of all time,7,21 December 2006,"When I first heard that a ""Rocky 6"" was coming out I couldn't believe it. I grew up with Rocky all of my life and I was finally gonna have a chance to see one in theaters. Who knew that it would be among the very best of the series? Unlike Rocky's 3, 4 and 5...the antagonist is represented as a human being. Mason ""The Line"" Dixon isn't an over the top character who has a 2000 psi power punch, he's a human being. This is something Stallone tried in ""Rocky V"" with Tommy Gunn but he still came off as a powerhouse. This film serves as a true reminder of how great and affective the first film was. The final fight is the most realistic fight since the original. This is the first Rocky film that I almost came to tears in. From the nostalgia to the final fight, to an aging Rocky Balboa, this film is truly touching. It almost seems like a restart to the series because these characters that we've seen for six films seem new again. But the best thing I can say about this film is that it's simple. The people next to me were displeased after it was over. I think they were looking for something that they had seen in Rocky 3 or 4. An over the top Rocky film. This is the farthest thing from Rocky 4 that I can think of. Stallone gave Rocky back to us. And he didn't butter or sweeten him up. He gave us an older, wiser, down on his luck, soul searching Rocky Balboa like we've never seen before. Trust me, it's worth every penny to go one final round with the Italian Stallion.",Rocky Balboa

But I still want to show my support (thumbsup from this overseas connection).didn't expect Rocky VI could be such a fascinating and encouraging movie. It is not perfect. But at least it has excellent tone, excellent spirit & above all, excellent Rocky the star! highly recommend all to watch this in cinema, if not buy the DVD when available (i'm no agent either).no more pirated DVD...at least, some of us have been educated, ultimately.",Rocky Balboa
843,brian-hyman-1,Turned out to be better than expected..,7,7 July 2007,"I remember reading that there would be a 6th Rocky film, and recalling the abomination that was rocky 5 and the fact Sly is nearly 60 my hopes were not high. But through some clever film making and at times some good dialogue, this film manages to portray the ageing process well and throws in a good rocky training montage and fight, just as all rocky fans would hope. This film attempts to get the Rocky movies back to there routes and although some of the montage sequences do try to proclaim the rocky films as being more iconic than they are, the film is well made and succeeds in portraying an ageing Rocky in similar ways the original portrayed the young and reckless Rocky. To me if your a rocky fan like myself this is a must see and leaves the franchise with a much better ending than 5. For those who aren't a rocky fan I would still recommend but the film is well shot and the soundtrack as ever is always a winner. 7/10",Rocky Balboa

It was a 'sweet' movie, and I would have happily sat through all the emotional stuff if I had been rewarded with a brilliant montage and an awesome fight at the end. Nope. The montage was mediocre (they even sapped that up with a puppy!) and the fight was... well, a draw. And WHAT was the deal with Marie? Did Rocky like her? Did she like him? What was that relationship supposed to be symbolizing? I'm gonna go watch Rocky 4 to make myself feel better.",Rocky Balboa
845,giusiof,Rocky is back ..........,9,20 January 2007,"this film makes to forget the ugly Rocky V and prepares the DVD case for the next Christmas. Stallone confirm to us that he's the best director of himself. A man who believes that what is within us must at all costs be pulled outside, otherwise it can suffocate us. A son that can't run out from the shadow of his father. A gentle woman, who remember us the Rocky I's Adriana, and the great Paulie complete the solid cast. The Rocky of this film, like the first Rocky, is not interpreted by Stallone, but he is Stallone. And this is the true force of this film. This is the right end of one of the best movies saga.

What can I say? it's beautiful and very well made. I also cried a bit in the middle of it. Am I stupid? I don't think so. It's just that I have grown up with Rocky. I was six when the 1st one went out, nine with the second one, 13 with the third one and so on. I want to say that the movie is ""believable"" (if it is a spoiler, it is very limited anyway). I suggest people should go to watch it. When I watched ""Rocky 5"" the end was a bit disappointing for me; with this movie I am happy that I found again the original Rocky that I had watched when I was a child (another spoiler, but very limited).If you are fond of the Rocky saga, this movie won't disappoint you.

Rocky V, you will say, tried to detach from the saga's tradition, made basically business...no. That's not entirely true. What Rocky V lacks is what Rocky Balboa happens to have: something to teach to us. Rocky Balboa, independently from Stallone's acting ability to reinterpret a character last played 10 years ago, independently from the entire crew's ability to shot this movie, manages to teach us a really important thing: you don't have to care if you are old, if you have to suffer, if your life is difficult...if you really have will you can succeed. ""We already know that!"" many of you will say...right, but Rocky Balboa succeeds in telling that to the viewer in very strong and touching way.

I remember when Sly Stallone first announced it on the View, I've been waiting anxiously ever since. It's not just a story about an underdog, it's about a 30 yr old actor who believed in himself enough to write the story and star in it despite being up against Burt Reynolds.....who? I also love the fact that as I get older, I get to watch an icon mature as well. Most of us don't live happily ever after, we tend to live out our lives with the ebbing and the flow that get thrust upon us. Happily ever after is being able to say ""I forgive"" and ""good bye"". Thanks Mr. Stallone, we appreciate your vision,A Canadian broad!",Rocky Balboa
849,boringtwdog,A really nice surprise,10,22 January 2007,"I went to see Rocky with my girlfriend, who is Not A Sylvester Stallone fan and or a boxing fan ! And, she like me, was nicely surprised about the story angle. Looking at it from his point of view, as an ""old"" man, trying to keep a grip on his glory days and not willing to give up. That, with some small really hitting the point jokes, to break the realistic drama trip, that this movie takes you on, from the start, is really nice ! It was for me, the most realistic Rocky movie so far, because for sure, Sly showed a new, (old) down to earth person, in Rocky, and the people surrounding him. I Think think acting, in combination with the story was really good and kept me many times, from eating my popcorn. The balance, in the movie, between drama, training, the actual fight, was also really nice. Not to much of anything. Maybe a little to much surprise, but in a positive way and or direction ! This is/ was not a fight movie, but a good emotional ending to a very long story.",Rocky Balboa
850,weecheats,What a fantastic film,10,22 January 2007,"Recently I have watched the Rocky films from start to finish and apart from Rocky 5 found them to be really enjoyable even although the genre is not my usual cup of tea...in saying that Rocky Balboa is such a brilliant film with the same spirit of the first film. Originally i was dubious about a now sixty year old Stallone returning to the role, I thought it was a bit pathetic, however the subject matter of the ageing, recently widowed boxer coming to terms with his loss and his age was dealt with fantastically. The training based on his age was realistic and the struggle during the fight was brilliantly done. Well done Stallone you have laid Rocky to rest in style.",Rocky Balboa

853,iqbal_s_channa,Disappointing,4,24 January 2007,"To begin on a lighter note, this film would have been much better if Ivan Drago came back for a rematch and instead of Dolph Lundgren, cast Arnold Schwarzenegger and both the oldies could have fought it out. Now I'm only guessing here but who thinks this could have grossed 100 times the amount of money and been an amazing film! I'm a massive Rocky fan, owning all the films (discounting Rocky V's existence of course) and when i heard another Rocky film was coming out i could hardly contain my excitement. Couple this with an impressive looking trailer and, although unrealistic, an intriguing plot line, i was looking forward to 2007.I have often wondered what could/should have happened after Rocky IV. Of course a film depicting Rocky continually winning fight after fight wouldn't draw in the masses and so i can see the reason for Stallone resorting to some form of hardship however i found myself depressed seeing Rocky in his new form. His character seemed to regress back into his more ""dopey"" days of Rocky and Rocky II as soon as he put his hat and leather jacket. (witchcraft i hear you ask, perhaps this would have made a more interesting film than Rocky V in which his hat and jacket were cursed and he struggled against a new form of heavy weight champion with magical/wizard like powers!!) OK, I've strayed here a little. I think the thing i hated the most about Rocky Balboa was the cheese factor and i can only draw parallels to a desperate Rocky and a desperate Stallone, both eager to regain some pride, in Stallone's case for making a string of horrendous films and in rocky's case continually trusting the fool ""uncle Paulie"".Also, i can understand trying to set a tone of nostalgia, the legacy of Rocky is great, but this theme dragged on for me and for some reason the writers thought they'd make this film into a form of comedy with way too many jokes, all of which made me feel like crying rather than laughing.Had it not been for my pride when talking up this films chances with rocky critics i would have walked out the cinema after the first 20 minutes.If your a rocky fan who hasn't watched rocky V and the new film, i envy you. For those who are fans of Rocky i suppose you have to check it out, the rest shouldn't bother.Oh, and why was the scenes where he trains for the fight so short? Its the one thing i look forward to the most and it was the most disappointing.",Rocky Balboa
854,edlingm,Almost scored a KO....but in the end dropped the ball.,7,25 January 2007,"Almost scored a K.O. .... but in the end dropped the ball. I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to see this movie. If you're a Rocky fan, this movie is a can't miss. If you've spent some time reading the comments about this film, it has probably become clear that it provides a much more satisfying conclusion to the series than Rocky 5.The movie was for the most part excellent. It felt like I was watching a real Rocky movie, a feeling that I didn't get in 3, 4, & 5. I didn't see the place for the character Marie, but it didn't really hurt the movie.The feeling that I got while watching this movie was that Rocky was sad from not having Adrian at his side, and that he was tired of telling stories to the customers visiting his restaurant. This leads to his fight with Mason Dixon(Antonio Tarver). As far as i'm concerned, Mason Dixon was clearly the least impressive of all of Rocky's championship opponents. Rocky's body had far more definition than his. Not only that, Mason Dixon's string bean body type made him look like a middleweight. This was actually the only opponent that didn't make me fear for Rock'e life. That said, the only logical ending for this movie was for Rocky to go out on his shield and die. I would have preferred a ending where Rocky actually wins the fight after taking a brutal beating, accepts the applause from his fans, and collapses in the locker room with his son and Paulie at his side. During the final exchange of words, Adrian appears to be reunited with Rocky forever. In the next scene Rocky's son appears at Rocky and Adrians grave site, pulls the chair from the tree and sits for awhile. He then repeats what Apollo had told Rocky in Rocky 4 just before he goes out and gets killed by Drago, ""We're the warriors, if we don't have a battle to fight we might as well be dead"". With that, Rocky's son puts the chair back in the tree, takes a few steps, then starts running. As he pulls his hands out of his running suit, it is viewable for the first time that his hands are wrapped. As he runs he throws punches in the air following in his dad's footsteps.The real ending to the movie wasn't a happy one for me. Even if he continues fighting and wins the championship again, he is still alone for the most part without anything in the world that will make his life satisfying.",Rocky Balboa

Bad acting, slow story and the worst fight scene since punch out back in the 80's.The dog Punchy is the only one who gets away with his honor. The directing is almost even worse then the acting. The classic training scene is the one part that at least feels like a real Rocky but again the visualization of the warm up as well as the press conference is platonic and without the accurate feeling.There is no real connection between Steps and Rocky and the argumentation between Rocky and his son is somehow more awkward then necessary.",Rocky Balboa
859,g-glover,A fitting tribute,8,5 February 2007,"When it was announced Stallone was making Rocky Part 6 most people ran for the Hills. They expected a Turkey of epic proportions. How satisfying therefore for Sly to deliver such a slick and worthy piece of cinema to perfectly top and tail Rocky.For acting and story it was similar to Rocky and the most substantial Rocky film since Rocky. The story was well thought out and believable that a man of nearly 60 years would come back into the ring. Clearly some time and thought had been put into the screenplay.It paid off with Stallone delivering his best "" Rocky "" acting performance since the first film with 2 particularly profound and moving speeches in the film.The boxing scenes were superb and realistic and Stallone was in superb shape shaming 40 somethings such as myself.All in all a very good effort Sly.8 out of 10.",Rocky Balboa
860,sharkattack01,Completely baffling,2,23 March 2007,"This movie was nothing more than a bunch of long winded speeches followed by the most boring boxing match ever put to film (or HD as is this case), yet in here you'd think it was the second coming of Citizen Kane. I've never seen more great comments for such a bad film in my life.Absolutely terrible direction (you can see Sly has watched a lot of other stuff and just threw it all in here; the hand held camera - it was like watching an episode of NYPD Blue, the quick overexposed flash cuts, the idiotic, pointless black and white with one color shots during the fight match which had no purpose other than I assume Sly thought it was ""neat""), awful dialog and predictable plot points make this just as bad as Rocky 5 and a completely pointless film that was only made for money and no other reason. Sly's terrible plastic surgery does not look good here (he's had a lot done over the years and it's really showing) and his ego shine on camera. There was a time when he was really a great actor but now, it's as if he's going ""I'm a big star and I can't get past that"" anytime he tries to act now.I just can't see how so many people liked this movie. Am I in the Twilight Zone? I like a good movie and I give any movie a chance, but this...it was terrible. Just awful. What happened America?",Rocky Balboa
861,justin-bellamy,enjoyable to watch,8,4 May 2007,"This is a movie that could have been too ambitious with its scope, but it wasn't. The story kept me engaged throughout as I watched a man struggle to cope with the grief from losing his wife and the monumental efforts made to restore his relationship with his son. The advanced level of maturity of Rocky is fascinating. From the first five Rockys, one gets the impression that he is just a ""dumb"" fighter. However, Rocky Balboa peels back the layers of the man and reveals a ""street smart"" person who has been beaten up by the world at times and has learned many important lessons and has had the courage to get back up and move forward. The moments in which he shares his accumulated wisdom are very touching (of which there are many). Although I would like to have seen justice done to the promoters who were interested only in profiting from the match, what happened to them more closely resembles what happens in real life which doesn't look like its scripted in Hollywood, and thus makes the story that much more impactful. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Well done!",Rocky Balboa
862,brandonjg06,Horrible...Stallone reaches new low..,1,26 March 2007,"With all the doubts I had going into seeing this film, I had to say I wanted it to be good...but when the credits rolled it just re-affirmed my initial thought, that this movie sucked and shrivels in comparison to ROCKY.Sly probably gives one of the worst performances of the year...the story itself wasn't good... and the relationship between his son was pretty pointless, his son didn't want to live in his father shadow but SOME HOW over 30 years after Rocky's prime, he is still getting recognized everywhere he goes.His love interest actually made me laugh when you think about the first Rocky... it was the same girl that called him a creep when he walks her home in the first one...wow... great... on top of that her son is half black and looks nothing like her, the relationship between him and rocky is stiff and boring..My favorite scene in the movie is where the love interests son and Rocky go to the pound to look at dogs... as they are looking at dogs the young kid picks out a young dog, as rocky picks out the old one..(most obvious metaphor in all of film) and goes on about how he still has something left in him...blah blah blah..The movie is in no way different from the previous ones: Rocky sucks at boxing, trains hard, gets better, fights a good fight... with the same old score playing in the background....Overall...just a bad movie I can't believe it is rated this high.",Rocky Balboa
863,shickman82,Great Movie,10,27 March 2007,"Seeing this movie has done a lot of things for me as far as wanting to go out and do more for myself, not giving up and fighting that extra round to get to where I want to be in life. I have watched all the Rocky movie's through out my whole life and seeing this one has had a huge impact on me and I'll tell you right now that none of the other Rocky's have ever made me cry until this one. After really being sucked into this character and being involved in the character's life and experiences it was really sad to see you go Rocky. So yes... Sly, you really did a great job on the farewell effect, very powerful lol. In my opinion this should definitely have a very good chance for best picture it would be one of hell of a way to go out. -Steve",Rocky Balboa
864,himamohamed15,The Best movie in Rocky Trilogy,10,13 February 2008,"Before watching this movie you can ask yourself about How Stallone can risk by another movie to Rocky?It's a great risk but he already success to enjoy us with this great movie. It's a great movie for a great actor because it's not only a fighting movie it's included also Drama and great feelings.After I have watching this movie I said to my self only one statement. The statement is you are a Great Champ Stallone!!Great actor, Great Director and Great Writer and finally Great fighter.We can say that this movie is the best in Rocky's movies. You enjoy us by this unexpected movie. Thank you Stallone.",Rocky Balboa
865,wordlifer3000,The way the Rocky Series should have ended...,9,26 April 2007,"after the infamous Rocky V, who honestly thought that any Rocky movie would be viable or worth it. First the critics got behind it then people like me, who stop and watch any of the first four movies no matter the time or reason. They say that Roy Jones Jr. was suppose to be Dixon but I am glad that it was Tarver since he brings more credibility to the character then Jones ever could. If you seen the other movies you definitely will like this one and be glad it ended on this note. If you see this first with out viewing the rest of the series you will like it, but I think seeing the full series will give a better perspective and appreciation of this movie. Enjoy it.",Rocky Balboa
866,lil_sicilian_wog,A Fitting Farewell.,9,15 July 2007,"There was much hype about this movie, all my friends were anxious to see it. I on the other hand really didn't look forward to it has i was unhappy with Rocky 5 and didn't have much expectations going into the film. Much to my surprise, it was a fantastic movie, definitely one of the better Rocky's made.The acting is great, the story is great, and Stallone looked great.I was unhappy with Rocky 5, it didn't provide enough closure to one of the greatest underdog stories of our time. Rocky Balboa provides this closure. Worth seeing, and is likely to make new fans along the way.9/10",Rocky Balboa
867,kmarcello,Thanks Sly for taking me back!!,10,20 January 2007,"I went to the movies yesterday for the Swedish premiere of ""Rocky Balboa"". First off, I'm a fan and had been waiting since Rocky V - I was not disappointed. I cried and laughed as I followed Rocky's final(?)adventure. Everybody in the audience seemed to enjoy it and in the end you didn't want to go home, you felt like you wanted to go one more round... The fight scene in the end really gets your blood pumping, can Rocky really stand all 10 rounds against this Dixon character? God I live for times like these, yesterday I was 15 again, helping Rocko out with my punches from row seven. He still taught me some valuable lessons with his numerous little speeches also. Rocky has a way of seeing things crystal clear...Thank you for the memories - but most of all, for creating the new ones!",Rocky Balboa
868,robkent,"Not perfect, but so much fun",8,21 December 2006,"Okay, so the movie isn't perfect. In fact it's many rungs lower than perfect but this is what going to the movies is all about. It's fun. There is real humanity. Simple, no BS humanity. Is it sentimental? Yup. Is it believable? Nope. But who cares? My disbelief was suspended for two hours because I like Rocky and I want him to keep being him. The whole thing is put together in such a way that we can all embrace the silliness that is the Rocky franchise. The five minutes where the theme song and the insane training footage takes place is worth the $12 no question. When people speak of eye candy and fun movies, this is what I think of. Simple characters living out archetypes the rest of us would never dream of considering. I loved it. Would see it again.",Rocky Balboa
869,ua77,Excellent movie worth adding to your personal collection,10,3 January 2007,"It is after a very long time that I have caught such an excellent movie without the CGI & other effects that have somehow taken over everything at Hollywood. I am not against effects or anything it's just that too many great movies could have done with less of them & more of the real stuff. This is definitely one of the best movies from Mr. Stallone. The movie is perfectly paced, has a great story & feels real most of the time. The reason I have given a 10 is simple, I cant seem to recall many better movies in the similar genre & I really don't think that this could have been made a great deal better. Hats off to everyone who made this movie possible.",Rocky Balboa

Defantly watch this if you are a fan, and if you are not a fan of the Rocky movies then you are an idiot with no taste in films :). Thats really all i want to say but IMDb says that your submission has to be at least 10 lines of text so.......... There had been some rumors about another film ""Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge"" but this is just a mith altho I do wish this would be an actual film that will be released but he said on British telly (TV) (The Jonathan Ross Show)that he would not be making any more but might consider making another Rambo movie.

Rocky Balboa was on last night and after reading the comments i gave it a go. I loved it a very easy going film fit for anyone. I'm sure i have seen at least one of the other Rocky films but i was never prepared for what i got. i fell in love with Sylvester straight away as he played his role so well as if all his lines came straight from the head and heart and not from the script. i would recommend anyone to give this film a look.",Rocky Balboa

The look and feel of this Rocky installment is back to the roots that made it great. Gone are the gimmicks of the 80's that ruined Rocky and long gone is the Nightmare Sylvester Stallone deserves an Oscar for best writing, Directing and Acting for this movie. I highly recommend seeing this movie in theaters with people who are also Rocky Fans. I am afraid of giving away to much but i will say at one point I caught myself yelling out, ""Get up Rock""!

I respect the film more every time I see it, and I thought I'd write something about it and send it along. Rocky Balboa reminds me a lot of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of my favorite films of all time. It's about one man overcoming his own sense of nostalgia, the negativity all around him, the false authority of bureaucracy, and finally finding peace within himself. The film depicts Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the snow, much as Kurosawa used the weather, and specifically a snow scene, to depict the moment when his main character finally gets in touch with himself in the present. I wonder how much of an influence Ikiru was on the film? Rocky Balboa is truly a masterpiece film, both for its screenplay and execution on film. It will stand the test of time as a classic, along with Rocky I.",Rocky Balboa
874,sarasola-joseph,inspiring,9,26 April 2008,"i found it to be a genuinely uplifting movie but i would have preferred to see rocky win the world title instead. the rocky character is very believable and does show that if you want to succeed at anything you do you can. i just hope that sylvester stallone reprises the role just one more time and wins his final fight, what does everybody out there think, so if you are reading this sly, go on just one more.just make sure that paulie is in it. what about if rocky does a comeback and by sheer luck wins, wouldn't that be a fairytale ending to rockys character. after all, in real life, george foreman did in fact achieve the ultimate championship win twenty years after first winning the title.",Rocky Balboa

Like the first it captured me with its message, the screen writing, the acting, and the realism. I think sly has to be congratulated on this work, like most people here, his work over the years aren't ones to harp on about, but this like one again will be a classic.the 2 speeches given by sly, the one where talks about getting his license back and the conversation he has for his sons are life lessons, it was well roundly written. I was saddened though not to see Talia shire aka Adrian. The 2 characters had great chemistry, she was the rock in Rockys life. The camera work was also well done, especially in the fighting sequence between Rocky and Mason Dixon.it was good to see Paulie back, and Milo ventimiligia(don't know if i spelt his last name right)is something to watch in the future. well done sly and well done Rocky.",Rocky Balboa
876,Dzon011,A cheap piece of sh%it,2,2 November 2008,"I have delayed watching this film for a year or so just because I was afraid it might turn out to be junk, but never did I thought it could be so awful, so cheap, so shallow and quasi-sentimental. Just to mention so some of you wouldn't get the wrong idea, i love Rocky films. The first is the best, in my opinion, but they all have something that makes them special, even if not of the highest artistic range. But this... Characters are, besides Stallone, who is his usual self, unbelievably shallow. Nothing happens in the film besides the fight and the same fight like a video-game preview. Everything else is just static talk. Rocky's relationship with his son is just a run through. All the dialogues are written monologue-for-monologue, totally unreal and all in a completely static setting. It's like 30 seconds one character talks, then 30 seconds the other one, and they just spit it out, like TV hosts. I don't mind it's a trip down memory lane, but a do mind that it's such a miserably pathetic trip, cheaply sentimental and just plain old awful. It just doesn't have any of the Rocky magic. I just couldn't believe it was so bad, far worse that the fifth. Didn't finish it, either.",Rocky Balboa
877,veejaish,Surprisingly very very good,8,1 January 2009,"This is for all those that are YET to watch this movie.I have always been a big fan of Rocky.Loved the first two parts and was OK with 3 and 4. But i never saw the 5th what with people giving such poor reviews. So when i heard the sixth was coming i never bothered to watch it, even though couple of my buddies who saw it said it was really good. I just got to watch the movie yesterday when it was showed in a movie channel and i must admit i really regretted not seeing it in theater. I had the idea that it would be all about a long time retired boxer fighting and winning a young ,talented fighter. Well,i was only partly right.But i was so impressed by the way the story was handled. It's the same Rocky that we saw in the first movie,someone you can identify with and root for. I had to fight tears at many points when watching the movie.In the end i was at the edge of the seat, cold palms praying ROCKY,ROCKY,COME ON. What a fitting end to one of the greatest characters in the movie history.Am gonna get the DVD for my collection.",Rocky Balboa
878,angelomcm,Decent movie.,7,21 December 2006,"While the rocky franchise has managed to keep itself very stable in the sports drama's, this movie maintains its own self very well in the genre. Most of them symbolize some kind of topic, like the fourth had an emphasis on the cold war, the 6th has the subject of change. A lot has changed in Philadelphia since the previous movies, and it is emphasized well. Rocky gets depicted as a very modest man, as usual, but has a hard time coping with distinct changes that have occurred in the near past. The movie itself is very varied. From emotional scenes to funny ones, many flashbacks to the past and the signature fight at the end of the movie. An aging Sylvester Stallone that gives a great performance and stays on-par with his role as Rocky Balboa. The movie lacks quite some character development, and runs at an high pace, however.",Rocky Balboa
879,ArnoldFan,Rocky Balboa,8,9 January 2007,"Although at first I did indeed pay attention to what the ""so called"" critics said.And now i guess I do know the term ""critic"".I watched the movie and as an unbiased film fan i arrived at a scale vote of 8 out of 10.The movie did show many times of emotional and maybe depressive scenes.But it was to represent real life happenings of the character.This made me appreciate the movie even more.I have seen and followed the character of Rocky as if it were a true life series.Too many movies these days I think take us out of the everyday reality.They don't seem to fit the genre of the people who view them..yet they make millions and millions.Although these movies do grant us an escape of our everyday lives,the Rocky series keeps things maybe a little more closer to home.In the end I review this film as a triumph and great improvement over the previous 4 sequels.If on the board serving the ""Oscars"" I would make motion to have this film series receive some kind of nomination for achievement.Compare apples to apples.Anybody who judges this movie based on what they just saw in say ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" stay home.Take the movie for what is or was in the series.I stand and applaud Sylvester Stallone for his work.And say thank you.",Rocky Balboa
880,marcusjamesus,Loved it,8,24 May 2009,"A lot of people I have talked to about this movie thought it was a real stinker. I thought it was a very good film. Obviously it won't win any awards but still a very heartfelt moving story. This one is definitely for the ""true Rocky fan"". If you know nothing of the previous Rocky movies, a lot of the stories references will go unnoticed though. Sylvester Stallone shines once more in that lovable character-Rocky Balboa. Although, perhaps a little unrealistic, the story is still nearly as inspiring as the original in my opinion. Every hardcore Rocky fan should love it, while non-Rocky fans will miss a lot of the stories sideline stories. The only thing stopping this film from getting the highest rating from me is the role of ""Baby Rocky"" was poorly acted. I wasn't impressed by his acting ability or seemingly one dimensional facial expressions. Still though, you can sense the range of emotions Stallone was going for and a very interesting movie. Rocky will never fade from my memory.",Rocky Balboa

With all the crazy reviews i was expecting it 2 be as good as rocky 4 or something. but what a load of lies that was! From the begging of Adrian being dead to the fact that the whole movie is about him applying for a boxing license! he also supposedly gets with some 20yr old when hes like 60! Also, what the hell happened to his son being cool. For god's sake what the hell was rocky 5 about when he was full on cool and fighting.Also, everyone is depressed and sad. Paulie looks likes hes a coke addict and wants to kill himself. I, in all that is good, hope sly will make Rocky 7 where he makes up or this hellhole.",Rocky Balboa

However, the Rocky fan will enjoy it a whole lot more than a regular movie goer. That said it is a movie for everyone.Right from the beginning of the film you lost into the Rocky character. Maybe Sly isn't the world's best actor, but he is Rocky, and you are quickly swept off your feet by Rocco's charm.Burt Young as Paulie was one of the highlights as usual. He plays a great sidekick to Rocky and as always, he can be counted on to supply some good laughs.Check out the film you won't be disappointed, I know for certain I'll be there again, a few times.",Rocky Balboa

884,danesgs1,well as a final casting call for the movie series,8,8 February 2015,"It was OK, what can you do about an aging fighter that has seen so much love and pain but in Hollywierd respect the writers that made this another of this last good film. More towards the man than the image i think. He had one last fight left in him. It was not for glory or fame or all the all other things younger fighters dream of, but to get rid of demons of the past. It showed a personal side beyond the fighter. I think in the long run one of the best of the Rocky series. He did not win but drew a draw. and later in life all that is what you can expect I win.Good film",Rocky Balboa
885,superbas_van_hulst,Rocky gives you that weird gut-feeling. again...,9,22 December 2006,"First of all, let me start off by saying this movie does not even come close to what I would normally consider to be a ""good"" movie. The acting isn't all that great. Casting -apart from the inevitable regulars of course- could have been better, and the storyline is cheezy as ever.But I gave it 9 out of 10. Now why is that you ask. When I was a little kid I used to tape all the rocky flicks and watch them when my mom was out (cause she wouldn't let me). I used to really get into these movies and get that really crazy feeling in my stomach hiding away from my mom. That is exactly what this movie made me feel, even though my mom approves it now I guess :-).I find that quite an accomplishment, especially considering the fact that I have not seen a Rocky movie in 10 years or so. In my opinion this particular gut-feeling is what movies should be all about. Give me atmosphere and nostalgia over current-day ""polished-up CGI multi-million dollar productions"" any day! And that is exactly why you should go and see this one, if you liked the predecessors. If not... stay away",Rocky Balboa
886,dittohead0875,do not listen to the critics!!!!!!!,10,27 December 2006,"This film, is on an emotional basis a fitting and honorable way to ignite, yet extinguish the film franchise of rocky. One word... Incredible.Stallones direction of the film brings back the basics of film making with subtlety, grace and charm. His portrayal of life, the lessons, loves, and morality of life make this a special portrait of what the rocky films started as and finished as, as well.Now to all those that have stood before... pissing on the last couple of entries in the film series, this breathes such a fresh breath of air, into a film franchise that could have worn its welcome out.Stallone has reached a new high, yes he was the action star of 80's and early 90's but i think that his roles were built on a little more depth than say Schwarzenegger, or van damned of the same era... this is by no means an exception to that role.interestingly Stallone's writing style and need for mood and atmosphere, have never been more apparent. you laugh and you cry, and you feel the pain and loneliness and loss, and discomfort in his life, yet a little piece at a time through the film you cheer for him, but not in the ring this time, but in his own life, the relationships he has... it is not a story of boxing, it is a story of life.Granted part 4 and 5, were a bit too dramatic... loved them, but there was something missing from them, the spirit of the first two films.... well folks, this one brings it all back. the only spoiler i can say is that of course the main course is at the end of the film with the main event, yet by that time, you are in the ring with rocky and you don't care whether he loses, because no matter what you know that he already won.",Rocky Balboa
887,jamescrome10,Rocky's back on top!!! :D,10,28 January 2007,"I have discovered that Rocky Balboa went to the top of the UK box office over the weekend, and have to express my happiness for this great result. When you consider that it's the sixth instalment to the Rocky series, that's a great achievement. It also went to Number 3 in the USA, I am very pleased with this :D When you consider that Stallone hasn't had major box-office success since Cliffhanger, this is a great moment for him, he's back! However, despite the success of Rocky Balboa, and it's great reception from fans and critics alike, I do not think that a fourth Rambo film will benefit Stallone. He needs to do other things, he's clearly a talented man, and having been a fan of his for a long time (even through the flops) I just think Sly should spread his wings and try different angles while he's back in peoples good books...What do you think?",Rocky Balboa
888,pdanbrown,Rocky returns to the beginning,7,20 December 2006,"This is the way Rocky should end. Stallone has returned to story telling and allowed us to care about the character again. I found myself almost cheering during the fight and touched by the final scene. Just as the original Rocky was character driven so is this one. As Rocky faces aging he also faces the fact that he is a fighter before anything else. The movie is also surprisingly realistic. I don't think it's plausible in everyday life, but it is not as unrealistic as I thought. The movie also has an almost independent feel to it. It is missing some of the ""slickness"" of Rocky 3 & 4 and emphasises substance over style. The odd thing is that this movie also makes Rocky 5 look better since it is not the end of the champ.",Rocky Balboa
889,muviefan02,Stallone proves he's more than a stereotype.,10,23 June 2007,"I just got done watching Rocky Balboa for the second time. I think I actually liked it more on the second viewing. The film is richly textured with great characterization and acting. I have to say that I think it was the best film to come out of 2006. When Rocky Balboa was announced people rolled their eyes stating Stallone was trying to capitalize on a film franchise that was worn out. I've been a fan of Stallone for a long time and I never once thought this when I heard the news. I won't lie and say that I knew it was going to be good, but I had faith in Stallone creating something more than an easy paycheck. The film he created delivered.. tremendously. It has so much heart and emotion behind it. The character of Rocky is a very simple man, he doesn't have all the smarts, but what he does have is heart. I think the world would be a better place if we all had a little bit of Rocky's character in us. Stallone has created a bookend to a series that has seen its ups and downs. But one that will live on for a very, very long time.",Rocky Balboa
890,scottishpaulsweeney,Doesn't matter if your are 5 or now 35 a fitting finale.....!!!,8,26 December 2006,"I was 5 when Rocky Balboa first hit the streets (I was probably about 8 by the time I saw this on Betamax, remember betamax they weighed about half a tonne and had a remote control on a cable). Never mind the details ,lets face it Rocky 1, 2, and 3 were classics and proved sly too be a great actor and director. True the sequels get weaker the paycheck gets bigger but even Rocky 4 was watchable... Forget Rocky 5 .Forward too 2006 and Rocky Balboa , I think the name suggests dropping the number i.e 6 and placing ""Balboa"" suggests a new start if not a closure too the series. Rocky B goes back too its roots and brings us back too the reason we all loved these movies . Sly Stallone and Burt Young roll back the years and you feel like you did rooting for the underdog (who you know will win if not do well).Forget your prejudices you know you don't want too like it. But remember the reason you loved Rocky (you could substitute boxing for football, baseball ,every day life) and you will see this is full of compassion and has been well produced, acted and directed....Finally if Sly can end the Rambo series as well as he has done our favourite underdog of all time , good luck too him..Adios Amigos Sweeney",Rocky Balboa
891,cburkos,Depressing and disappointing to series.,2,1 April 2007,First of all I semi respect this movie because it is part of The Rocky series. But this movie was just depressing unlike the excited full of action other movies in the series. The main problem was that the character of Adriennewas killed off. She did not die in the movie before it. I don't know why they had to write her off dead. If the person who played her did not want to be in it they could of found someone else to play her or just not have her in the movie. The second thing is Rocky was kind of involved with this younger girl who was the cocky teen in the first Rocky. Then the Ice rank where Rocky and Adrienne had there first date was knocked down and Rocky went to his bar he use to go to but hasn't gone latley and there was totally different people there. Also his son who was a cute baby in Rocky 2 and a nice kid in Rocky 3-5 is an older unpleasant adult. Than to top everything off Rocky lost his fight at the end of the movie. The only other fight he lost was in the original Rocky but he rematched and won it in Rocky 2. So they could of written this movie better or to make the series as good as it was they should of not made this movie.,Rocky Balboa

893,flomp83,Please don't tell me anyone actually took this movie seriously!,2,7 January 2007,"GD Stallone always makes himself look like a bad ass in all of the movies he directs, it's disgusting. An hour of this creepy old guy hit'n on a young girl who he used to walk home? And then all of a sudden he decides he wants to fight, so there's less than four minutes of training and then maybe 15 minutes of the actual fight which he used different camera techniques to make it look like it was actually on ESPN or something. OMFG this movie should not be rated so high - WTF is everyone smoking? It wasn't even a real fight, it was an expo. and he had his ""crew"" (old-ass Paulie - ""I've got two watches!"" and the son of the girl) up there with him.....just plain awful!",Rocky Balboa
894,cjmarques,Loved it.,9,21 December 2006,"I never get sick of the Rocky movies, but if asked before this movie to rate the series I would have said it peeked at Rocky 3. That is no longer the case. Not only did he return to his true form but this one ranks right up there with the best of them. This series has finished off in style. Upon hearing that there was going to be another Rocky movie I was surprised and a little worried. Rocky 5 was watchable for me but just barely. I couldn't figure out how he was going to pull this one off. Suffice it to say that he did and I'll be paying the 7.50 to see it again.Great movie.",Rocky Balboa

It brings back memories & details from the old films & still continues Rocky's legacy & story... What is really funny if i recall, people said that this movie as gonna bomb... & yet, the irony is... Even as a movie, people thought of Rocky as a 'Hasbeen' 'A joke' when they found out he would fight again...& all it just did was come around & kicked them in the ass HAHA!even for Stallones age, he still has kept the character of Rocky the way we have always known rocky for... Kind hearted, Yet pulls up one mean of a punch...I HIGHLY ADVISE YOU GUYS TO SEE IT",Rocky Balboa
896,pdelw00,A Very Fitting Ending To A Great Franchise,9,20 December 2006,"This movie was well made with excellent direction and this was a truly fitting ending to the ""Rocky"" character. Sly gave a wonderful performance as an overage boxing legend. The way the movie inter-twined everything that was going on around ""Rocky"" was well done also. The problem with his son and his brother-in-law's troubles.The main point of the movie was not about ego, not about money, not even about fame, the main point was how you can release your inner demons so you can move on with your life and start living again, instead of continuing to live in the past and dreaming about what your life once was.This movie has drama and action put together brilliantly and it also has the one thing that defines ""Rocky""..............heart.",Rocky Balboa
897,KayneWest,Rocky Strikes Gold,9,23 December 2006,"Stallone has done it again.I can't even count the amount of times I had watched the trailer for this movie. That's how excited I was. I had very high expectations for this movie. And Stallone hit every single one of them.Music: Music was excellent in this movie. Each and every song was used correctly and defiantly made the movie touching and inspiring.Writing/Movie: Wow. I was completely amazed at this. Stallone couldn't have done a better job. The movie was inspiring, emotional, funny, powerful, and meaningful. Some parts gave me chills. There were also many life lessons in the movie that were fantastically put in.Actors: Not much to say, but all the right people were chosen. All of the actors are very talented.There are more, but just too many to even list here. The movie absolutely blew my mind. Stallone has ended the series with a bang, and I'm sure this one will go down in the history books with Rocky I.",Rocky Balboa
898,Cato76,Learn when to stop,1,27 December 2006,"In Hollywood many people should learn when to stop. or is that in 10 years we going to see Rocky training his grandson to fight against an Iraqi boxer (United States doesn't have anymore problems with Russia). also, if Stallone is ""such a good actor"", why all his characters/movies are the same? can he do anything else. Rocky Balboa is just boring. and after this I doubt that I'm going to see any other of his movies, I feel I wasting money, because going to the movies in New York is quite expensive, plus if you buy pop corn and a drink you easily expended 20 dollars, and in a movie like this that is a waste. I really hope that Hollywood do movies more interesting and that stop making those movies of happy endings that doesn't give you anything to think about. Again Rocky Balboa is just boring.",Rocky Balboa

Because there is not much displaying of exercise performed by Rocky Balboa. Then during the match, I am very sorry to see this in details Sly does not seem to master boxing techniques, such as when Dixon did not hit or making attack Rocky moving away tried to avoid the attack (Scared to get hit perhaps). And the attacks did not seem real (Except the last rounds), and also Dixon make fake attack (seems so..). And when Rocky attack Dixon, he always holds Dixon's shoulder. It's more like MMA fight. Little disappointing for me. Sorry...But still I like Rocky I, II, III, IV and V better.",Rocky Balboa
900,darren034,very good movie,9,26 December 2006,"My god I did not believe it Stallone pulled it off, A very good film, worth all the hype. It was one of the best rocky's of them all. I do believe that he went back and dug it out of himself and remembered where it originally came from cause he took me back to the time when I first watched the rocky (1976) for the first time. very inspiring, compelling, driving, motivational, and last but not least damn if stallone can ACT. I give it a definite 9 of 10 only due to the lack of adrian. I want to personally thank MR. STALLONE for a very good view... Thank you very much MR. STALLONE. It was very much worth the money I paid to see it. I will buy it on DVD when it comes out.Now if he can do the same with RAMBO.",Rocky Balboa
901,Captain_Creampuff,A very nice movie...,8,12 March 2007,"I have always been a fan of the character of Rocky Balboa. To be honest I don't even think they needed the boxing scenes to make this movie good. I like how they didn't make Mason to be the bad guy. They made him just a guy who needs a challenge. The characters of Marie and Steps are a nice change of pace. I hated to see Adrian go, but honestly, how many times can you see her telling Rocky that he can't fight and then change her mind at the last minute. I liked the restaurant angle, Rocky Jr. kind of bugged me because why couldn't he have been proud to be who he is. But honestly, those are small quibbles. It's a nice movie to end the series starring the ultimate nice guy",Rocky Balboa

It was a good movie and worth the price of a matinée admission.It had good acting,a decent story,and sowed up some loose ends. I would rank it as follows among MY favorite Rocky movies as 1). Rocky III 2). Rocky 3).Rocky II 4). ROCKY BALBOA 5). Rocky IV 6). The Abysmal Rocky V. It was an excellent and fitting end to the Rocky legacy,but most of all it takes the bad taste of Rocky V out of your mouth!",Rocky Balboa
903,fiver1971,Awesome!,9,26 December 2006,"I saw Rocky Balboa the day after it opened and was floored by how good it was. I have been a fan of the Rocky movies since I was a kid and this movie had all the heart warming aspects of the first installment of the series. The audience in the theater was cheering for Rocky by the end of the movie and it seemed that everybody had a huge grin on their face as they left the theater. With this movie, Stallone has proved once again that he knows how to write a movie that will touch and inspire! One last note, this movie all but makes up for the terrible ""Rocky V"" which was a black mark on the whole franchise. It gives the series a respectful resting place. See it with someone you love!",Rocky Balboa

The messages and inspiration from the movies are unmatched and once I heard about this movie I, like most fans was pretty iffy on the whole idea but once I stepped tonight and saw that movie it was a whole different story. The movie is very well written and came straight from the heart, there was no half-assing this story and with that came a gripping story which really shows Rocky not at all like i thought he'd be at this stage as even though he's punch drunk he still has the same innocence and wisdom to put things perspective for not only the supporting characters but also the viewer which so few movies are able to do nowadays. In the end it will leave you doing the same thing you did when you first saw rocky one, cheering.",Rocky Balboa
905,htviusa,Welcome to ROCKYLAND!,8,30 December 2006,"If you liked the first Rocky movie, you will definitely love this one. Personally, I'm not especially fond of the first movie  just to put it lightly - but I enjoyed watching this one. It was great once again to listen to the well-known Rocky tune, which you encounter several times during the movie. However, you will have to wait about 65 minutes until he put on his gray training outfit, as he was still living in the seventies. I can only say that it is a great tribute to the Rocky saga finishing it as it started. A great story once again written and directed by Sylvester himself. Will Rocky win or lose this time? I can only say: ""Watch it!!!""",Rocky Balboa
906,fergus-13,They think it's all over... it is now,10,5 August 2007,"What an experience watching this movie. Having grown up on Rocky, each film in the series has something about it that sticks in the mind.With the typically 80's excesses of the genre, I'll be honest and say that elements like the increasingly outlandish opponents (Ivan Drago, Clubber Lang, etc) and supporting characters (the lowest point probably being Paulie's robot in part 4) meant that by the time we got to Rocky V the series was punch-drunk, with nothing left to give.For me, this film changed everything. I stopped smirking at films and began believing again. Stallone brilliantly gets back to the roots of the first movie. The tone, look, pace and feel of the sections in Philly are spot-on. You can feel the heart that Stallone has put into this (As a comparison, contrast this with the approach and results that George Lucas had when revisiting his franchise).By the time we get to the fight, it's really a done deal. I felt won-over completely. Stallone / Rocky realises that 'It ain't about how hard you hit, but about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward.' Rocky takes the punches life has thrown at him, finally moving on from his wife's death.The references to the earlier film, use of minor characters, music and locations feel just right, without being forced. Stallone was right to kill-off the character of Adrian as it provide the drive for the character with her shadow hanging over every frame of the film.Just like Rocky in the final round of his career, the series ends on it's feet, still giving all it's got, in a brilliant rounding-off of the saga.",Rocky Balboa
907,ianthefist,What a swan song!,8,1 February 2007,"So here we are, exactly 30 years after the original movie. About 20 years have passed in Rocky's world, placing him in his early 50's. His beloved Adrian has died of cancer 5 years previously, and we find Rocky in a state of permanent mourning and anger that it ""wasn't supposed to be like this"". Rocky is now host at his own Italian restaurant in his old neighbourhood, where he still lives in the same house used in Rocky V. He spends his days stocking the kitchen and his evenings regaling diners with tales of past glories. It is left unclear to the audience, I think, whether he does this for his own interest or only on request of the customers. In the streets of his hometown, he is constantly called to and asked for autographs and we see him politely dole out the rote response that presumably most famous people have to deal with.The Rocky in this movie is subtly different, too subtly for most viewers to notice, but a treat for fans to pick out. He is more articulate and we imagine that the deceased Adrian will have encouraged him to improve his reading over the years. His relationship with his son is somewhat strained owing to his son feeling overshadowed by his father's legend, but with an underlying closeness still present that one would expect them to have given Rocky's devoted fathering in earlier episodes.Rocky is deeply unhappy. He seems to be going through the motions of a life alone that he never expected and hasn't learned to cope with. As we expect, an opportunity to fight the current heavyweight champion presents itself just as Rocky decides he wants to fight again on a small scale. The question of why he wants to fight is an interesting one  Stallone has long used the Rocky character (sometimes unwittingly so) as a metaphor for his own life, and as we hear his son ask him ""why do you want to do this?"", we are aware that the response is Stallone's justification for making this movie.The inevitable training montage and showdown, accompanied by Bill Conti's stirring score, happen as we know they will. Stallone knows we are expecting it and does not pretend that he has anything other in store  the opening scene effectively sets up the whole idea so that we can get on with seeing the film's real purpose: revisiting an aging, familiar character who still has a passion for life, but does not know how to go about pursuing it. The movie starts slowly, with Rocky demonstrating his pain at the loss of his wife by re-visiting all of the places they went to in earlier movies with her brother Paulie. This is a slow and frustrating exercise and Paulie reflects the audience's frustration with this in his acerbic comments. But gradually and quietly the tale draws us in to Rocky's life as he, like most of us do, tries to find continued purpose in life.As to how it all ends - Rocky wins? Rocky loses? Rocky dies? We are left guessing, or left with the assumption we walked into the cinema with, until the very end. Ultimately it is of little consequence because this is a movie about life and life is not about the destination, its about the journey.",Rocky Balboa
908,Beeslo-1,Rocky Returns to Us and Reminds Us Why We Fell in Love with Him...,10,12 December 2006,"I caught this movie recently at Butt-Numb-A-Thon 8 in Austin, TX and I couldn't have picked a better place to see this movie. We cheered through the whole thing and loved every moment of it. I grew up with Rocky and I share all of his journeys, his victories and his pain...but never have I truly bonded with this character until now. Some would regard its predecessor Rocky V with ill-will, calling it a waste and a horrific movie that should be forgotten...and I would agree with them up til that last comment. Yes, it was bad. But it shouldn't be forgotten, just like any horrible experience we go through life. It should be remembered and we should take the moments that are important to remember and carry them with us. While a bad movie indeed, Rocky V still showed a man who had lost his passion and what he wanted to get it back. Rocky Balboa could be unofficially titled Rocky V, Part II mainly because it is a further extension of Rocky's life after loss. At the beginning of Rocky Balboa, we discover that Rocky has lost something more important to him than boxing and it is slowly tearing him apart. He owns a business and it is very successful but he has no one, not even his son who has distanced himself from his father's life. The movie hardly centers on boxing and more on Rocky as a person. We learn the daily habits and regimes he goes through each day and we see how he views his local community and how he hopes to help it. We see the people's lives that he touches and we see how they love and admire him. However after all he's given and all he's loved, there is something that is eating away at his soul, something that he hasn't accomplished. He craves the ring again and this is no longer the tale of a man who wishes to become a somebody in the boxing ring, this is the tale of a somebody who wishes to become a man again in the boxing ring. He craves it to prove to the last person in his life that his existence means everything: himself. The writing is Stallone's best and his acting is Oscar worthy. His supporting cast is memorable and incredibly well made including TV's Heroes star Milo Ventimiglia, who wonderfully portrays a person whose own existence echoes in the shadows of his father. The movie is wonderful and it brings Rocky's saga full circle so well, that it is one of the most peaceful yet triumphant finales of all time.",Rocky Balboa
909,amholten,Surprisingly Good and Almost Nearly Great,7,20 December 2006,"I thought this was a very tight, well acted movie that retreads some old areas and breaks new ground. Stallone embodies this character so well and delivers some amazing acting. There is a scene in the meat locker with Pauly that was truly terrific. Rocky starts to break up and can't talk. Stallone is smart enough to let it build to that point and cut away. It is damn-near masterful, especially when you remember/picture Stallone crying in First Blood.I think the filming of the fight scene in television quality rather than motion picture frames was distracting and unnecessary. It looked like you were watching ESPN rather than a movie. Roger Ebert has noted that the flicker of motion pictures induce a dream-like detachment from reality. You only notice when it is missing and here you really notice it.It's hard to believe, but for me the training and fight scenes detracted from the movie, whereas in the past, these were usually the best. I liked watching Rocky tool around Philly and his interaction with old and new characters. His relationship with the grown-girl who once called him a freako is played perfectly. There no sexual tension, just sweetness. I even liked the return of Spider Rico (sp?). His boxing commission speech posed major pitfalls but it also lands lightly and on target. On the whole the movie was fraught with dangerous pitfalls and the potential for enormous mistakes. This movie threads the needle and comes out as a very well done closer.",Rocky Balboa
910,mirkp07,great end to the rocky collection,9,15 December 2006,"this film really has nothing to do with boxing, its more about rocky getting over his wife's death, connecting with his son, and ""letting the beast he has in the basement out."" The music is great and has the feel of Rocky 1. The movie is sad at times and funny at times and sly gives some very deep speeches about life and life's lessons. His son is upset cause of the shadow that his father cast on him. He can't go no where without someone saying he's the great Rocky Balboas son. Rocky cant get over his wife's death as he visits her grave every day and goes to the places they used to visit. I like how sly used the flashbacks, very good production idea. This is def. Stallones best acting job, he doesn't over act, moan as much, and he doesn't appear as dumb as the Rocky character was in the previous films. It's great how he brings characters such as Little Marie, Spider Rico, and Apollos trainer back into the film. I liked how they called the fight an ""exibition"" and not a title fight and Stallone didn't make the ending corny. Overall, Rocky fans will love it, some people might hate it...remember the moral of the story was his life was a million to one shot..this is a bout a man from the bottom, a man who wasn't smart, who couldn't sing or dance, a man most people could relate to, and most importantly a man who could just fight. You will clap at the end of the movie",Rocky Balboa

If you're a fan of the first one, Rocky Balboa is the must see film of the year. If you are new to the franchise you will understand why everyone loved the first one. It has the same spirit as the first. Stallone's directing is flawless. His writing is flawless. His characterization of an underdog just wanting to go the distance, the pure heart of Rocky mostly lacking from the sequels has returned. But as I marveled over this film I realized the others were necessary to tell the entire story. This one is so great not because the others aren't, but because we the audience have gone the distance with him as well. This is rare film making. I guarantee you will fall in love with Rocky all over again. Sylvester Stallone is a national treasure.Tommy Jay San Diego, Ca.",Rocky Balboa
912,hiredhand,Mixed emotions,7,28 February 2007,"Rocky Balboa is a weird movie. Strictly as a movie it's quite bad but you just can't hate it. It's filled with overemotional speeches, forced cameos from previous films and unnecessary montages but still you like it. Maybe it's nostalgia or the seriousness of Stallone's devotion but I enjoyed it far more than any of those other new sports movies(Invincible, Glory Road, Coach Carter...). Rocky Balboa is a movie I really expected to fail. Even when the positive reviews started coming I remained skeptical so I was pleasantly surprised when I finally saw it. In the end I give it 7/10 because not very many movies(let alone sequels) have this much heart.",Rocky Balboa
913,yzzman1,An incredible film....,10,6 December 2006,"I just attended an advance screening of Rocky Balboa. This film is a truly beautiful character piece that deserves tremendous praise. For those of you who have written off Sylvester Stallone as an actor - you are in for a re-awakening of his talent. The writing is phenomenal as is the truly inspirational feeling you will get watching this - much like the first Rocky movie. Stallone wore three hats during the filming as screenwriter, director and star. Burt Young makes a terrific return as Paulie. Another highlight is Geraldine Hughes as Marie. Personally, I couldn't have hoped for a better conclusion to this legacy Sylvester Stallone has left for American culture known as ""Rocky Balboa.""",Rocky Balboa

But I wasn't bored out of my mind or sitting in the theater wondering if I should leave or wait till then end cause something good might happen. I thought that it was nice that he wanted to go one last round of his life. Something that he really loved to do, he could go out with honor instead of being known as a has-been.

915,jhooker10,Shoulda left that little bit down in the basement.,6,20 December 2006,"This film missed a lot of the things that made past Rocky films great and even good. The little quirks and nuances that made Rocky so fun and lovable were missing from much of the movie. It felt flat and the script felt uninspired. The highlight of this flick was Paulie who delivers one great performance. For some reason, Rocky never has the same son twice. Why that's so hard is anybody's guess. Antonio Tarver (Mason Dixon) looks out of shape for this one and precious little mention is made of it. While the trademark theme is there, it would have been nice if the score made more of an impact. They stray from the plot a good bit. The boxing scenes felt so utterly unbelievable that boxing fans like myself may feel a bit slighted. Aside from that, it felt like an excuse to print money. So many holes were left in the plot that you could drive Rocky's van through it. Hopefully, this will truly be Rocky's last a-yo.",Rocky Balboa
916,bjlovel,a very well movie,10,20 December 2006,This movie was really well done. It was as good as the rest of them if not better.I remember talking about Sylvestor Stallon three years ago since he was trying to get this movie done for the past seven years with my friends. We thought Stylvestor Stallon was only trying to bank off of the Rocky movies success. Now I believe we were all wrong. He truly is Rocky. I was finally glad a studio picked up his script.

Many will argue the first is the best simply because of awards and acknowledgements, but look past the hype, and look into the deeper message that Rocky Balboa sends. Never quit, try your hardest to be someone, and love conquers anger.From Sylvester Stallone to Burt Young to Antonio Tarver everyone played their role perfectly. Is it entertaining as part IV?

920,wog_to_envy,Rocky Baboa goes the distance once again....,9,23 February 2007,"This movie is exactly how a rocky fan would expect from a sixth installment, it has minor glitches but at the end is a winner.The movie is the most emotional from the series and fits the story as Rocky lost Adrian and has a broken down relationship with his son. The acting from Stallone and the rest of the cast is excellent and adds true quality to the movie. The movie does well into bringing the original feel to the Rocky series with trademark rocky music and many characters from previous rocky films.Now for what the movie could have improved upon. For starters Micky left the gym for rocky in his will, why instead of the restaurant couldn't he run the gym it would make more sense. secondly a big part of the Rocky series is the training which this movie does not have enough of, if that was lengthened we would have had a better Rocky experience.Overall Rocky is a quality addition to the series and is a pleasure for any fan to watch.",Rocky Balboa
921,BryanScott886,Simply Super Ending to Franchise,9,22 January 2007,"Rocky Balboa is certainly the most satisfying since #4. And yes, Stallone wanted to remove #5 from the memory banks. Here he's crafted a fine script, key actors such as his son, and Burt Young as Paulie has Never Been Better. In most of the films, as you should, you really get inside of Rocky's head, and in this you feel like he's alone. He doesn't have Adrian, who has passed five years before. He has Paulie, which isn't saying much, though Burt Young is terrific in this final chapter. And he has his son, where the story line could have been a bit tighter; however they have a great heart to heart in an alley scene. Excellent speech by Stallone that reminds me of Pacino in ANY GIVEN Sunday. The training scenes will make you wanna get out of your seat. The music is just as great as the original, updated with some guitars and sax. He uses real time HBO PPV camera angels, and the ending is just wonderful. You feel good for Rocky himself, you feel good about your Rocky, and you'll wanna have that inner beast to fight like you did back from the first one. A true underdog story, Stallone wins with his final chapter in one of the best stories of all time.",Rocky Balboa

I originally made fun of the Rocky series, but after seeing the first one, I understood why it became such a hit. This last one brings us back to the spirit of the first one. No flashy house, no tired relationships...just Rocky, and his last fight. Sly brings back the mumble mouth full of awkward laughs and charming spirit. It has elements of every one of the films, just enough of each. I saw a quote from Stallone that said something like I just want people to think it's not too bad. As a harsh critic, it was way better than that, it was a great movie. Perfect end to the series.",Rocky Balboa

I saw a special sneak preview in Detroit at a Kronk Boxing Gym benefit. Although the first 45 minutes kind of dragged, and at times the dialog made me cringe, its at least as worthy of Rocky II or the original Rocky. A lot of flashbacks, but it definitely wraps up the series a lot better than Rocky V did. It won't win best picture, or any great acting awards, but the cinematography was better than I've seen in a lot of the previous 5. As far as the big question in the blogs, does Rocky die in this one, you'll have to wait till Christmas and see for yourself. The music was great, the final scenes were great, and Paulie was great! It was also interesting to reintroduce the characters of Little Marie and Spider Rico from the first movie.",Rocky Balboa

The way Rocky goes down in the fight is really realistic and the punches seem real. didn't really like Rocky's kid in the film though and the dog is a bit crap but other than that its awesome!!! Paulie is awesome in the film as well, he's proper funny! Antonio Tarver plays a good part as well! I think it's very good and realistic film. Stallone plays an awesome part. Amazing comeback for Rocky!The fight seems like we are watching a real fight because of the timer on the screen which i think is really good, and the fight is one of the best. the film seemed to be over too quickly though. One of the best things about the film is the flashbacks of the other films, like the flashbacks of Adrian and Rocky's fights are awesome.",Rocky Balboa
925,imakefights,Beautiful.,9,22 December 2006,"This movie is beautiful! It completes the series perfectly. Many theater-goers erupted in applause at the end, and understandably so.I especially liked the way it introduced the problem boxing faces with commissions deciding who can and cannot box as if they have the right to tell people what they can and cannot do with their own lives. Even though Rocky passed a barrage of tests, the commission still ""couldn't grant a boxing license in good conscience."" The point is, he shouldn't have to pass any tests if he wants to box, no one has the right to tell him what to do with his own life. Other real life fighters have had the same difficulties with this, the most famous being Evander Holyfield and Joe Mesi.Over all the movie was inspiring and a perfect finish. Where the 5th movie left Rocky penniless and brain damaged, this one left him with a sense of completion. He was on good terms with his son, he finished a final fight with pride and satisfaction and the final good-bye to the crowd was also the final good-bye to Rocky. The classic end with ""Yo, Adriane, we did it,"" was perfect. This movie takes us back to the way we felt after the 1st Rocky movie.",Rocky Balboa
926,bobby-cat,closure,10,23 December 2006,"I'm a Rocky fan from day 1. This is truly one of the best in the series. I really enjoyed watching it. Stallone proved he still is Rocky. The movie starts slow, as every Rocky movie does. He builds up the way Rocky is living and dealing with every day life. Rocky Lost Adrian years back to cancer. It's obvious Rocky didn't found his peace yet. Also the relationship with his son could be a lot better. Stallone showed to me that he can act. A lot of people say he can't but I think otherwise. Just watch and judge for yourself. A must see for every Rocky fan.Bob",Rocky Balboa
927,kemal_evrim,Very very surprising!,6,11 March 2007,"When I first heard of a rocky 6 movie, I thought: it must be a joke. But I watched the film anyway and it was inspiring. Especially the first part. The dialogues were incredible. And it was not a film just about box, just like the fist one. Good job Stallone! The only downside of the movie was after the match was started you hear all the comments that have been made by the broadcasters and you see the graphical representations like watching a real fight on TV. I think that it was an easy way to dramatise this situation. It felt like a copy paste style from TV. That was the only reason why I don't give 9 points for this movie. Anyways, thanks Stallone for not messing this up and bravo!",Rocky Balboa
928,PretenderNX01,Character driven film serves as a great conclusion to Rocky series.,9,3 January 2007,I thoroughly enjoyed this film! I congratulate Stallone on creating characters that have endured over the course of thirty years! This is a great companion piece to the first Rocky! Rocky himself is such an enjoyable character. This movie confirms my belief that Rocky is someone we all can relate to. Balboa may not be bright-but he has heart-and plenty of e.q.!This film can be enjoyed on its own-since the story of Rocky is so much a part of our popular culture...for the best understanding it does help to have seen the first Rocky!I think Stallone has been underrated. Not too many film makers can boast of creating such and enduring and popular character as Rocky Balboa!,Rocky Balboa
929,DDBURG-1,A Must See Movie,8,20 December 2006,"I have just seen ""Rocky Balboa"" and must say that I was extremely impressed and pleasantly surprised. I must admit to being a ROCKY fan, it was the reason I went to the theater in the first place, because the trailer sure does not do the movie justice, but even if I weren't, I would have enjoyed this film anyway. It has everything a person could want: gut tightening drama; laugh out loud comedy; and of course, the knock down, drag out action only a good fight movie can give you. For those of you who think Sylvester Stallone can't act (some of his earlier films makes one wonder), it is my belief that this film will prove you wrong. There are many poignant moments that have you believing Stallone really is a washed up fighter struggling with the ghosts of his past while looking to relive the glory days of his career. Although this is not as good as the first ROCKY movie, Stallones' back to the roots writing and directing style mixed with his excellent acting and a great supporting cast makes ""Rocky Balboa"" a very close second. Some people may think this film is ""corny"", to that all I have to say is; ""Bring on the butter, I love corn!""",Rocky Balboa
930,manny-dounias,"Yo Adrian, he did it!",10,22 December 2006,"I was raised in the 70's and I whenever I see a new film based on one of my old childhood heroes (all 3 Star Wars prequels, Superman Returns, etc.), I immediately get those butterflies in my stomach as soon as the film begins. Yet by film's end I walk out of there angry at the fact that well these new films were a waste of celluloid and their characters carbon copies of their former selves. Not so with Stallone's ""Rocky Balboa"". It is simply not only the best Rocky film since the original, but Stallone's best film since the original.Stallone crafted a story which brought Rocky back to his Philly roots and put him in a situation we can all relate to. People telling you ""NO"" and you going out and giving them all you have to finally hear a resounding ""YES"". If you thought that it was hard for Rocky to accomplish this when he was 30, then he will really amaze your eyes and soul at 60. Sly acted and directed in ""Rocky Balboa"" with pure confidence, didn't take himself too seriously, and just had fun. In the end, he made a modern day masterpiece. The movie script is also very sharp and sprinkled with some poignant speeches by Rocky that have a greater impact on your belief system than anything the world of sports or entertainment has given us in years. Sly was also supported by an excellent cast who made it all look very realistic, and even the boxing scenes are more reminiscent of Raging Bull than Rocky 2-5. I just loved it! In a day where it's all about cash, pure image, steroids, and celebrity gossip columns, Stallone shows everyone who ever ridiculed him what he was capable of. And in the process blows all of these plastic stars out of the water. For tonight for over 100 minutes on screen he reincarnated a man who makes us all believers; and the sweat and courage he placed in this film are much more than what any of the charlatan stars of today have done in their entire second rate careers. I was afraid that the passion, hunger, and class that Rocky Balboa, Indiana Jones, Christopher Reeve's Superman, Don Mattingly, and Michael Jordan all exuded was gone. But tonight I left the theater knowing that it's still here, living and resonating in the heart of a 60 year old Italian American boxer named Rocky Balboa.In short, Stallone has created a timeless film, and along with the gems made by Scorcese and Eastwood these past few months, I know the Hollywood of today is a pale joke to the days of past. Stallone, it's good to see you are back. Bless you my friend and thank you for making me really feel like I am 5 again; that's what great pictures are supposed to do to a man. But it is something I cannot say I have experienced in quite some time.",Rocky Balboa
931,xxx_dx_,Yo Sly You Did It!,10,23 December 2006,"Everybody had given up hope of ever seeing a good Rocky movie ever again, but Rocky Balboa sure made fools out of a lot of people. Not only was this good it was on the same level with the original, based more around the drama that is life than the actual fight. Good to see Spider Rico return, and the character of Marie. Not to mention a great fight at the end, and a touching tribute to Adrian.The only faults with the movie is that we do not get much in the lines of flashbacks from past events at times when they were needed, especially a moment where we could of easily heard Mick scream out the words ""Get up you son of a bitch, cuz Mikey loves ya"" Definitely worth a showing and nobody will be disappointed, this will have you jumping up and down chanting ""Rocky, Rocky, Rocky"".It proved that Sly is not middle aged and crazy, more middle aged and brilliant. Yo Sly, you did it, you did it!",Rocky Balboa
932,renny-9,Worst movie ever,1,20 January 2007,"I grew up with the Rocky movies and used to love all of them, until I saw this. I had to force myself to finish it hoping it would get better but instead, it got worse, a lot worse. Some type of soapie meets pooh bear. Ouch This is not the way I would like to remember my childhood movie days. Mr. Stallone you are banned from making any more movies, please, pretty please. I can't remember when last I saw such junk, you insult our intelligence. Don't bother watching this no matter what you're age or preference in movies is. Who would like to see an hour of Stallone drama followed by a 60 year old climbing in the ring with the current world champion and almost beating him with his Hollywood style boxing. Mr. Stallone you are trying to cash in one last chance too many. IT'S Over!",Rocky Balboa
933,ntsoromokos,A Critical Analysis from a Major Fan,8,21 December 2006,"Last night I was able to watch Rocky Balboa with a bunch of friends, both men and women, most of which were past Rocky fans. After exiting the theater, I turned to my friend who is not a Rocky fan and asked him what he thought. Without saying too much, he told me he loved it.I have to first qualify my statements by saying that I am a huge fan of the Rocky films and was extremely disappointed by Rocky V as it clearly didn't ""fit"" with the other films, both in style and in tone. After viewing the film last night, Sylvester Stallone has re-entered my good graces. He has made a thoroughly enjoyable film worthy of its predecessors. It successfully recaptures the heart and humanity of the first two Rocky films like no other film since part II. Without going into detail, Rocky had devolved into a almost robot-like character who simple got a challenge, trained and won in the final moments of the film. This movie was not so much about the fight itself but about Rocky's voyage to this part of his life, where he basically is a broken man, and where he goes from here. The fight scenes are not what we are used to. They're not the polished and model looking ones that Stallone choreographed in the 1980's with the help of the music video generation. They have a realism to them that the other films did not. Stallone also knows the physical limitations of Rocky at this stage of his life and incorporates them into his fighting style very well. The packed house loved the boxing scenes and the training scenes as well. Next, one cannot speak of this Rocky film or any other Rocky film without discussing the tearjerker aspect of the film. All I will say is that this author fought back tears several times over during several scenes. Finally, while there have been a myriad of critics of this film and Stallone especially for making it, both positive and negative, in the end, I think we all must admire a man in Stallone's position for making a film where he was capable of falling flat on his face after a decade of being a non-player in Hollywood. He's made a winning film and I for one am glad to have Rocky Balboa back in my movie life.",Rocky Balboa
934,cobretti28,First time I cried in a movie theater,10,20 February 2007,"I would just like to say that anybody who dislikes this master piece doesn't have a heart. What's the matter with those people? This movie is just brilliant and heart warming from the start. It ranks right up there with the original. To be honest, when I heard that a sixth installment was coming up like most people I was really skeptical. But Sly really proved us all wrong. Thank you Sly for this movie! I'm so anxious to see Rambo IV! I'm sure Sly will bring this franchise to a worthy ending as well! ""If you know what you're worth go out and get what you're worth - but you gotta be willing to take the hit!""Stallone continues to be the most underestimated actor/writer/director of the world!",Rocky Balboa
935,nemo_2057,"Very good idea, Sly!!!",8,6 July 2007,"Well done Sly!!!! This movie is hugely better than Rocky IV and V, a series with the first 3 and this one should have been a real legend. I can admit, considering the political and historical moment, Rocky IV, but the V was really terrible. The beginning is really sad. The risk was to be pathetic but it did not happen. In the rest of the movie we can find all the irony, the dignity and determination of the first Rocky Balboa. I liked very much all the reminders and the quotations (i.e. when he drinks eggs in the glass!). The movie is not too long and the part of training and match is not exaggerate. The end is well made, definitively not out of bounds! Just one thing to do, perhaps making this movie some years ago should have been a little bit better!",Rocky Balboa
936,bjp727,Hey Mr. Stalone...,9,29 December 2006,"I loved it. Thanks for making this movie. Of course noting is perfect but the spirit of this movie is huge. A bit of a bumpy start which, quite frankly, reminded me of the first Rocky. It was that roughness that was part of the magic of the first movie and, in my opinion, brilliantly recaptured in this last Rocky movie. What I find ironic is that the character Rocky is laughed at in the movie for being an older man trying to fight one last fight. No one respects him until he gets into the ring. Its kind of like the movie itself. Everyone I know was saying, ""another Rocky, oh please..."" But after they saw the movie... well, no one I know was laughing. A truly touching story that, perhaps like the first Rocky, will stay with me forever. Thanks for taking the chance on one last Rocky.",Rocky Balboa
937,czlapaj,It was just great !,10,25 December 2006,"I saw this movie today, i just couldn't wait till march (Polish premiere). And 4 words: It was just great !! Yes my fav Rocky movie is still Rocky IV (i just love the montage, the mtv-styled fight, and Stallone look in RIV), but this one now belongs to my 2nd fav. Rocky movie.I shed some tears (like in the previous movies), had a couple of laughs and a couple of ""ouch!! Damn that has to hurt"" moments. Seeing Stallone crying and how everybody tried to take him down was really touching. He had to fight with everyone, not only with Mason ""the Line"" Dixon, but also with his son and some of the public.Most of the movie concentrated on how Rocky feels after all these years, and after Adrians death. The training sequence was short, but this movie wasn't only about boxing (like the 4th part :D). Well i wont say anything that wasn't said before. Just go and watch it. I think it was a very good movie.",Rocky Balboa
938,OldSchool77,Probably the truest sequel to the original...,9,20 December 2006,"...in terms of style, plot, and pacing. It just feels like the original. For those who grew up with the Rocky who beat Mr. T and Ivan Drago, this could be a bit of an uneasy fit. Mickey's death notwithstanding, III and IV were more action-oriented overall. His interactions with the other characters, rather than any actual boxing or training, are what truly drive this film forward. However, Stallone positively nails the main monologues and lends Rocky the same heart that made all of these films (except V) classics of one kind or another. He deserves high praise for Rocky Balboa.Easily worth the price of admission, but if you go over the next couple of days, expect to miss a line here and there because of audience cheering.",Rocky Balboa
939,misterfrench,Rocky Balboa Delivers!,10,22 December 2006,"Just saw this movie at a preview screening. Being a fan of the series I had hopes that this rocky would close off the series better than Rocky 5 tried to. Balboa starts out rather drawn out and slow but i realized this builds emotion for the fight to come. You cant but help get attached to the characters of this movie, including the new ones. This Rocky moves along the lines of the first one, which is a very smart move on Stallone's behalf. A few minor issues i had with this rocky is that what ever happened to the brain damage rocky got in part V?? But apart from that it was a great film. The end bout between Dixon and Balboa delivers some great intense moments that only a Rocky film and Stallone could deliver. Burt Young's character returns as Pauly doing a once again great job. The one part I also found a tiny bit weak was the training sequence. I usually get goosebumps around this time, but for some reason it didn't pump me up. I still think the best training sequence was Rocky 4 in Russia.Overall this was a stunning piece of cinema and a great conclusion to a fantastic saga!Rocky Balboa Delivers!",Rocky Balboa
940,sonicdynamite,Fantastic finale to the Rocky saga,9,4 December 2006,"I had the opportunity to see a screening of this movie. Having been thoroughly disappointed with Rocky five, I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I am very happy to say this movie brings the Rocky series to the rightful close that the fifth left so empty. This movie isn't so much about the boxing itself, but getting back to the roots of the Rocky story...that determination and courage with the love and help of others makes Rocky a winner no matter what.This movie is rated PG, and parents will be happy to see that the graphic nature of boxing has been toned down quite a bit in this movie compared to others in the series. If you're looking for a touching family movie with a powerful message, Rocky Balboa is definitely a movie to see. I think adults and children over the age of 10 will throughly enjoy this movie.",Rocky Balboa
941,shortstacked77,"Great movie, way better than expected",10,21 December 2006,"I must be honest, I wasn't expecting much after seeing Rocky 5, but this was much improved. The dramatic aspects and the character development were on point for a successful sequel. I'm really glad that they came back and ended the series on a positive note especially since the last installment was Sooooooo lousy. Thanks for doing it the right way!!! This movie made me laugh, cry and cheer and again, it was much more than expected. If you loved Rocky 1 thru 4 you'll love this movie. I hope they stop at this movie and end the series... as it is totally necessary. Overall, I think that viewers of all ages will enjoy this heartfelt story that needed to be told.Brian Liberatore",Rocky Balboa
942,cpkrunt,Welcome Back,8,9 November 2007,"I saw the original Rocky on a birthday dinner date with a roommate. I was so impressed that I went back the next night(this theater was about 35 miles from my home, by the way)with a friend who loved boxing movies. I liked the next two installments quite a bit, too, but number four just didn't do it for me. There were too many ""music video"" style moments for my taste. I was so disheartened by it that I didn't even bother with number five. But I'd heard good things about this one so I gave it a look. I enjoyed it very much. It didn't reach the level of the original or numbers two and three, for that matter. But I think the best thing I can say about ""Rocky Balboa"" is that it reminded me of why I enjoyed the first three pictures so much. It had heart. It felt comfortable and familiar. I knew these characters and it was good to see them again. I think ""Rocky Balboa"" redeemed the franchise. When that movie ended, I had a the biggest smile on my face. It was good to have Rocky back.",Rocky Balboa
943,anywho_1,"At 60, Stallone finally gets deep.",8,20 December 2006,"I just saw this movie, and I must say I was impressed. I had heard what people were saying about it, for instance, Sports Illustrated said the best part of the whole movie was the clips during the credits showing random people imitating Rocky.Well, I personally think they were wrong.I went into this movie with low expectations, expecting it to be a good action movie, that makes me want to go kick someones butt after I see it, but I got something even better I think it happens too fast. The first half of the movie is spent showing Rocky rebuilding his life after his wife's death. The training is actually almost too quick to get you excited for the fight, but you get excited just the same.I don't want to ruin it, but this film is full of great quotes. The thing I liked best about this movie, though, is its message. It teaches us to look beyond winning and losing, and reminds us, once again, that what's really important is self-respect and honor.As Little Marie tells Rocky, "" You don't move for nobody until you're ready to move."" I still wanted to throw someone down after watching this, but I also left remembering the importance of honor and dignity.",Rocky Balboa
944,dwp-5,Pathetic,1,22 February 2007,"I can not understand anyone actually scoring this lame piece of junk anything over 1. It really was awful. Awful wooden characters, poor acting, over use of music to make us feel sad or happy. It starts slow and continues in a sad, lingering way, delving into the past, encounters and flash backs that are there to make us more involved with the film and give it some deeper meaning. They only serve to show that really there isn't a story here, not much direction and 90 minutes to use up. Can I say anything good about it, erm well, to be honest I am struggling and personally am very glad it is the last. Come on people, what were you thinking. There are lots of excellent films out there where you come away with something. This really was not one of them.",Rocky Balboa
945,ghallium47,A Truly Worthy Send-off for all but the purely cynical,10,21 December 2006,"If you're like me and thought that all the Rocky films since the second one stunk, you'll really enjoy this film. Rocky 6 is about the nature of a man's existence, what makes it worth living, and what should and should not determine a person's worth. It's a film not about boxing at all - but about characters that truly come across as human beings, not personalities form a script. All of the schmaltz and sappiness you've already seen in the previews, so just grin and bear those 30 seconds.Also, this movie is the antithesis of flashy. Most of the scenes are shot so realistically I was almost pinching myself. I went into the film looking forward to the final fight with great anticipation, yet ultimately it was just the cherry on top, while the emphasis and what made the film worthy of viewing is what transpires before the supposedly climactic event. Don't see this film just because you liked the previews. See this film if you have respect for the original Rocky movie and would like to see an appropriate, thought-provoking conclusion.",Rocky Balboa
946,marc-marinelli,Rocky Balboa,8,5 February 2007,"I have just seen Rocky Balboa for the second time. A better movie the second time around. Stallone and Burt Young really deliver in this last installment. I felt the first hour of the movie was done extremely well, good tempo, comparable to the first movie in terms of it's mood and tone. The Little Marie character played by Geraldine Hughes was done excellent, the perfect casting choice. Knowone can replace Talia Shire as Adrian but this character really hit home and I'm very proud of the fact that Stallone understood how to write for this character. Stallone is running a restaurant in this film and the part actually suits him quite well. Stallone plays on his age in this one which is refreshing to see. He's still in great shape mentally and physically with this character and for anyone who might be doubting themselves personally in life right now this is a film you will want to embrace.

948,steve-2600,A fitting end to an iconic series,7,8 February 2007,"The Rocky series was, in my opinion, a bag of mixed successes. Stallone has decided to go back to the roots of the Rocky Formula on this one, and the result is not unpleasant. It would be unfair to call it a remake of the original movie, though it does contain some elements of it. There is nothing wrong with the production value and the movie looks quite polished. The script is typically Rocky-ish, relating to issues of friendship, love, self-worth, and the like.On the other hand, the plot arc of the film was slightly off, and the characters were never fully explored and developed. I felt that the first half of the movie was overdrawn, relying on flashbacks to the previous entries in the series. I never felt that I hated Mason Dixon as much as I was supposed to, and his motivations were not entirely clear. Stallone clearly had much more money for this film than some of the previous ones, likely helped by the gratuitous advertising for the Golden Palace Casino.And now for the training montage. I felt that it did not have the oomph of the previous montages - my favourites would have to be from Rocky's I and IV - the dichotomy between Balboa's and Dixon's Training felt artificial.The final fight stuck to the tried and true Rocky Formula. However, I felt it was a bit unrealistic, in that in reality an older fighter would try to end the fight before his stamina ran out, as it inevitably would before the younger fighter's.Despite these drawbacks, this movie stands at least as good as the later Rocky's, but not quite as good as the first.",Rocky Balboa
949,marsh76,Great flick... probably second best Rocky made,9,21 December 2006,"Stallone doesn't let you down with this last episode in the Rocky series. I don't know for sure, but it seems like it was filmed literally in the streets of Philly. Definitely not your typical set. The camera work is awesome too... it gave more of a feeling like you were right there watching like a fly on the wall.Like always, a moral story to be told, but this one had a lot more meaning than most of the other Rocky movies that came before this final one. I don't want to spoil the plot, but I'll just say that the writing and acting is so superb, that the message transcends all ages, genders, etc.My wife watched it with me and was worried that she wouldn't get it or enjoy it, because she had never watched any of the previous Rocky movies.

The new version of ""Gonna Fly Now"" was good. It Was good to see Tony Burton And Burt Young Back as Duke And Paulie Respectivley. the flashback were excellently presented. i liked how the computer animated rocky was based on his rocky 2 appearance. it was sad that Adrian had died in the film but the Adrian's restaurant kept the character alive. 2 Thumbs Up Rocky********",Rocky Balboa

I must admit after first learning of 'Rocky 6' I was a little apprehensive yet remained upbeat and positive about it (although occasionally filled with dread at the thought of another Rocky V). However after watching the film any fears of another shoddy sequel were completely dispelled. In my humble opinion, this is the greatest Rocky film since the original all those years ago. It has a similar 'low key' feel to the first one and for the most part is realistic unlike the other Rocky sequel pantomimes (c'mon, Thunderlips!?), this has a believability that hasn't been present since the original movie. The script is well written and well delivered by all the actors, the cinematography is good (there is a scene mildly reminiscent of Sin City) and overall this is a great movie that I highly recommend. After the film is over Balboa walks away with dignity as does Stallone. This is a fine piece of writing, direction and acting on his part and will do no harm to a revival of his career. Of course, he will still have his critics (it's hard to forgive films like ""Stop or my mom will shoot"") but this is certainly one of Stallone's finest hours that rates right alongside First blood and, of course, the original Rocky.The feel-good hit of the year. Overall, two big thumbs up - a success has been made out of a project that could have fallen flat on it's face.",Rocky Balboa

A computer simulation between Rocky Balboa (Played by Sylvester Stallone) and Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) was created to see who would win if Rocky fought him when he was young. In the simulation, Rocky won. Dixon's managers approach rocky and offer him an opportunity to fight Mason Dixon, the current Heavyweight champion of the world. The reporters called Rocky a has been and even his own son didn't want him to go through with the fight.The story in the film was very captivating and inspiring. For example in the film, when Rocky was training for the fight, you can feel how much he wanted to win and that he was willing to go to any length to get there. The film had a lot of action too! The fight between Rocky Balboa and Mason Dixon was very intense and it's almost as if you can feel Rocky get hit as you get more attached to the character,Overall, I would recommend this movie because it's an action-packed, inspiring homage to an awesome series.

They basically destroyed a legend.The bit with Adrian was a travesty (Was there any reason to kill her off)and i didn't like the weird sexual tension between Rocky and Marie. The conflict with his son was never really explained. And there was just too many gaps in the story for my liking. This is one of them movies that can only be watched once and then maybe again if its on TV and you have nothing better to do!I know 90% of us thought if Stallone was going to ever make another rocky it would have involved him training his son and so on..... But no he wanted the lime light one last time.,Rocky Balboa
956,JerzeyFinest20,Rocky Balboa: A Microcosm of the American Downtrodden,8,21 December 2006,"Reflection is ultimately what human beings have to look forward to in a world succumbed by war, poverty, and chaos. The ability to smile through the hardships and cherish the fondness of memories is potentially the only guarantee to savor a positive outlook on life. From the opening throwback ""Take You Back"" theme, Rocky Balboa truly ventures through the experiences of Americans of all socio-ethnic backgrounds. The constant display of Philadelphia's decay, formerly one of America's most prosperous cities, is a reflection of the downgrade America is taking today. The movie manages to stick to its Philadelphian roots, exploring the blue collar South Philly Italian neighborhood where Rocky is worshipped, to the mean streets of Kensington where he can find himself lost in the shuffle like most of its lower class citizens. As he travels to a familiar bar where he once commended Apollo Creed for taking his best shot, he finds Little Marie serving him a drink. While she seems to have matured into a loving mother who is caring for her interracial son, Steps, the destiny of a whore is essentially the outcome she faced as Rocky drops her off at her dilapidated Kensington row house. However, Rocky seemingly finds that he must look after a woman who once berated him some thirty years ago. Now that Rocky Jr. is grown, Rocky essentially finds Steps to be a new son he can support. It almost seems like the teenager is what Rocky saw in his own self: a humbled youngster on the streets trying to find himself. The scenes with Marie and Steps show that despite all the glitz and glamour Rocky had lived throughout his life, he comes full circle into his own with his people: the everyday American struggling in a nation that praises the glories of wealth, progress, and competition.Rocky's son is the prototype of a young blue collar American trying to fit into the corporate world. After arguing with his father that he only got a job because of his last name and constantly had to live under his shadow, Rocky Jr. realizes that his strive to find his own identity simply shed his own pride. Rocky Jr. tried to mold himself into a mindless drone in Philadelphia's yuppified Old City neighborhood, only to find that his own roots were a better fit for him. Paulie's role as a disgruntled employee of the Shamrock Meat Factory is about as realistic as it can get for an old timer who still has to work to live. His spiteful and disgusted comments can be seen among many ""old school"" Americans from an ethnic European background in working class America.Even though Antonio Tarver seems scrawny in the movie, his character Mason ""The Line"" Dixon is perfect for boxing and sport's current transitional period into a wasteland of hopelessness, much like the Philadelphians Rocky interacts with such as Marie, his son, and Paulie throughout the movie. While Mason Dixon finds himself in a depleted world of heavyweight boxing and a lackluster period of sports in general, Rocky finds his own people to be caught in ancient world that entirely neglected them. Caught between worlds with the grittiness of his old mentor at his rundown gym and the glitzy high life of a rap culture, Dixon finds himself unable to find his own identity. Essentially, he is merely a flashy resemblance to Rocky's humbleness. While Rocky struggles to go about his life without Adrian by his side, Mason Dixon struggles to find the respect he feels he so rightfully deserves in his bubble of fame, fortune, and his own inner pain of having to wake up every day as a hated champion. The movie is not about a miraculous training montage or Rocky winning the fight against Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. Rocky Balboa simply is doing what every does in the latter years of life: reflect. In his case, he so happens to have the will-power and stamina to compete in one last fight just to prove that he still has the heart of the champion. The heart of the underdog is something every American struggling to simply survive on a low end job in a depressed atmosphere has inside of them.",Rocky Balboa
957,haggisholder,Rocky Fans Must See,10,28 December 2006,"This movie blew me away. I saw the trailer but waited awhile to see the film. I read the reviews. Then I watched the film and was totally surprised.The most surprising thing to me is that I had heard that the film had all these religious overtones and that it was being marketed to the religious crowd. This would have been fine, but I wouldn't have seen the point in doing that. Nevertheless, I found both to be false.The film is definitely a ""modern"" Rocky. Except for a few of the old cast members, everyone else seems to be new and modern characters. But just when you start to wish for the old scenery and characters, the film begins to change. On a whim, Stallone is perfectly back in the Rocky character - the only role he perfectly fits (IMO) - and all of the sudden it feels like an early Rocky film.It is so well written that most should be able to identify with it. It deals with what life really is. It will evoke your emotions when you find things in the film you identify with. It will make you sad and then happy.Most would probably agree that the film develops a bit slowly and accelerates during the last 20 minutes. While this is true, I think this is a major reason the film is so good. I think the high ratings on IMDb are because of the quality of writing and how cohesive the film plays out. You really get to know the characters and really get a feel for the environment because of this. You get the understanding that life can find the weak links in any warrior's armor; yet in the end, there is always a way to move on.Of course the fight is awesome. It is different because it has a ""Contender"" - type feel to it. The fight wasn't filmed in some studio gym, but was filmed in Vegas where modern boxers fight. This was a bit disappointing to me, but yet, this is another way this film works. Don't read the spoilers - just see the film.This film is all about heart.If you liked and identified with the earliest Rocky films, this one is for you.If you hated Rocky 5, you will love this film.I wish Rocky 5 was never made, but after watching this film, I wish for more. But... if it has to end, I don't think they could have done any better for a final film.",Rocky Balboa

960,izquierdista,Overall,10,24 December 2006,"This movie combines a nice father/son story, and all that came with rocky and rocky II as well as surprising landscape cinematography and ring shots. Overall, Rocky Balboa was surprising. In a few weeks period of the release of THe Good German with Clooney, Blanchett and Maguire and The Good Sheperd with Deniro, Damon and Jolie I think this movie will hold its on. Despite the names and talent, I think hearing that Rocky Balboa will surprise will not only attract the middle-old age men I saw at the theater but also young men and women, couples and other people as well. The spoiler, if any is that I certainly enjoyed the stupidity/lovebility of Rocky with his traditional sense of humor.",Rocky Balboa

It makes you want to stand up and fight for what you want. I went in thinking that this was going to be just awful. What a very very nice surprise. If you want a good way to pass 2 hours it is well worth any money spent. Its more than just about boxing. It is about standing up for what you want in life. Working your butt off to get it, and that great feeling you have after you get it or get there. Just my poor opinion of things but hey this is my first review.How many hits can you take and still keep fighting. Any time I need inspiration this movie will hit the spot.",Rocky Balboa
962,JayFree33,Perfect Ending (Rocky V Do Over),10,22 December 2006,"I admit I wasn't really chomping at the bit to see it, but upon a friend's recommendation yesterday, I decided to check it out. First, there IS a very slight cheese factor (it is #6, remember, but we're not talking Mighty Ducks 3 when Goldberg switches from Goalie to defense because he's good at ""picking up garbage"").At any rate, you get past the c factor pretty quickly and I promise you that you will enjoy the rest of the movie immensely. It is a very perfect and fitting end to an amazing series. We all know that Rocky V was terrible, and I think Sly must have decided, ""Yo, We can't go out like that, ya know :)"" I think when this comes out on DVD, I am going to buy it, throw out Rocky V out of the box set, and replace it with this one. I promise you'll enjoy it and you will leave saying, ""Yep, that's how it was supposed to end."" Definitely go see it!!!! -Free",Rocky Balboa

I must say that I did not expect much because of the idea of it all, but Stallone found a really great story to tell. He managed to circumvent the ridicoulousness of the situation with excellent dialog and ingenious plot progression. The characters and acting were all wonderful and Tarver gave a surprisingly good performance. The only thing I would have done differently is to trade the entire movie (time, everything) for Rocky 5, but at this point that is neither here nor there. Wonderful movie!",Rocky Balboa
966,icekareem43,As bad or worse than Rocky 5,5,22 December 2006,"There are different levels of disappointment in life: 1) Mild Disappointment: ex) Getting a burger or steak overcooked at your favorite restaurant 2) Medium Disappointment: ex) Your dog poops inside the house 3) Hot Disappointment: ex) Auburn is served a massive helping of humble pie against a Georgia team that lost to Vanderbilt 4) Fire Disappointment: ex) You're an Alabama fan 5) Tongue-Torch Disappointment: You find out your long-term girlfriend is actually a dude on an anniversary special of Ricki Lake 6) Nuclear Disappointment: ex) Rocky VI After viewing this movie, I felt it was a civic duty of mine to get the word out that Rocky Balboa is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. You are thinking one of two things about this movie: 1) Dude, Rocky is awesome! I don't care if he's 60! Or 2) Dude, Rocky is 60, I absolutely refuse to see this movie! Those of you who agree with #2 are right. *Spoilers Ahead* I'll go ahead and get the good things about the movie out of the way. For a 60 year old, Sylvester Stallone is ripped. He's ripped for a 20 year old. They kind of used the same advertising tactics that they used for Godzilla for Rocky Balboa. No one knew what Godzilla looked like until they saw the movie, and people would go see the movie just to see what Godzilla looked like: A giant Iguana (AWESOME!). Similarly, I saw this movie primarily to see if Sly could still pass off as a threatening boxer at the age of 60. What was a little disturbing about Rocky's physique was not that he's muscular or in great shape, but he has become completely engulfed in VEINS! In this movie, Sylvester Stallone looks like a giant leathery heart: Okay, that was the good thing about the movie: Sylvester Stallone is actually still in great shape. Now onto what is horrible about this movie.I couldn't understand half of the things that Sylvester Stallone was trying to say. My friends and I were wondering if Sly was actually supposed to say something specific from the script and he just aimlessly butchered the English language by muttering ""muhrurohrooo,"" or if on the script they actually just put: Pauly: He's a Bum! Rocky: *Mutters indecipherable Stallonian-Italian gibberish* Adrian is dead. Rocky spends over half the movie teasing this chick he met at a bar. But the relationship goes nowhere, because Rocky still has Adrian in his heart. Awwww. Each Rocky movie needs something to kill time leading up to the training montage and the huge fight. In the first Rocky we enjoy the pleasant clashing of personalities between Rocky and Adrian as they develop a relationship. In Rocky 2 Adrian has a baby and slips into a coma. In Rocky 3, Rocky is caught up by pride and is humiliated in the ring by Mr T, and also has a wrestling match with Hulk Hogan. In Rocky 4, Apollo Creed is killed by the Super Russian Ivan Drago. In Rocky 5, Rocky becomes a manager and has to deal with his punk underling and then is forced to ""Stall-own"" him But in Rocky 6, Rocky teases a chick and never does anything about it.The fight was awful. In each of the Rocky movies, you have some sort of fear that Rocky is going to be beaten to death. But in Rocky Balboa, despite the fact that the 60 year old Rocky could kick the bucket due to wearing soggy socks outside, you never get the sense that he is about to be punched so hard that his already permanently bruised brain might finally detach. In fact, according to the fight in this movie, the 60 year old Rocky is the least likely to be hurt.The villain was weak. Mason Dixon was portrayed as an overrated champion in the first place. The fight between Dixon and Rocky was dubbed an exhibition, and was supposed to be a ""glorified sparring match."" Dixon even says before the fight that he wasn't going to try unless he feels threatened! The announcers in the movie even mentioned that Dixon looks like he's out of shape for the fight and he wasn't taking it seriously. During the match, Dixon BREAKS HIS HAND! They could not have made this fight any easier and less meaningful for Rocky. And despite having every single lucky 'break' (pun intended) going his way, Rocky still loses in a split decision, but takes home a moral victory I already saw this movie earlier this year when Alabama lost to Florida.So the moral of this movie was supposed to be that no matter what everyone thinks, ""You gotta do what you gotta do."" That no matter how hard you might fall, don't let anyone talk you out of chasing what you think is right. I wanted to go see this movie because I love the Rocky franchise. I have been yelled at for wanting to see this movie, I have been hounded for being interested in seeing a 60 year old Rocky return to the ring, I have been ridiculed for even giving this movie a chance! But I applied the lesson that I was yet to even learn from this movie, I ignored everyone's negative comments and followed my own dreams. And what was my reward? Watching an old leathery organ lose to an overrated chump with a broken hand in a meaningless fight. The real lesson: When everyone gangs up on you and tells you that your dreams are stupid and fruitless, listen to them and stop chasing your stupid dreams, you bum!",Rocky Balboa
967,ponyexpress-1,I saw Rocky Balboa twice last night,10,21 December 2006,"That says it all. What an amazing movie. Last night was a very moving experience for me. I felt every emotion possible. Tears of joy and sadness and of memories and of pure exhilaration. I couldn't control my physical excitement when that music started. I could feel the pumped energy from everyone in the theatre. We needed a Rocky movie. I felt like I was watching real people, people I have known forever (I was born in 1975) a credit to directing and the acting and the writing. Stallone's performance was his best. I will go see it again, and again, and again. I want to witness the joy and the emotions of the audience. I want the feelings I felt last night to come over me again. It was a catharsis. It lit a fire in me that I haven't felt in a while. Thank you Sylvester Stallone for your vision. You did it.",Rocky Balboa
968,urockstar,Disappointing.,5,21 December 2006,"I went to see the new Rocky movie tonight....I was pretty excited because, well, I am a pretty big fan of the movies. Now, I wasn't expecting much. Actually, I was expecting this movie to suck. After seeing it, I can't exactly say it SUCKED, but yes it was seriously disappointing. It so terribly lacked the drama that all the other movies had. Of course, it never would have been able to compare to the other movies (at least, 1-4) as a whole, but my god, it could have at least had as much drama in the final match, or even in the training. But no, nothing. No damn drama. Every now and then that familiar dramatic music would start up, which made you think some serious ass kicking was about to occur at the hands of the Italian Stallion...and it got people in the audience cheering and applauding in anticipation of what was to come....but it lead to nothing.Besides the lack of drama, there was a serious lack of character development (always a problem for me), and basically just a lack of characters! I know some actors may have been available for only so much, but then why put them in at all? Tony Burton, the guy who played Apollo's trainer, and then eventually Rocky's trainer...he shows up for the training in this film, is only in about 2 scenes, and then has a minimum amount of face time for the final match....he's basically pointless to this story...which is sad because he could have added so much more to the film if only he had been given the opportunity. And what about more from Burt Young, aka Paulie? He too could have contributed so much more....and seriously they could have spent at least five minutes showing what was going on with these characters over the past 5-10 years. It just didn't feel like enough...? I think more than anything I'm just sad to see the actors getting so old. See, now I just want to go watch the original again. I'm just sorely disappointed, as I think many people will be, because Stallone had a real chance to do something great to bring closure to this series, and instead just kind of let it end on a boring, although slightly touching note. (slightly being the keyword) As much as I worried this movie might suck, I still expected more than this. I get what they were trying to do with the end, but MEH.Being nice, only because I have a love for the older movies, I can say this one was okay. It almost felt unfinished. Nice starting off point but should have gone through a few more revisions before getting the final stamp of approval. It left me wanting more, and not in a good way.",Rocky Balboa
969,ricky_suave716,Rocky Balboa scores a Knockout,8,20 December 2006,"Thirty years ago, Sylvester Stallone gave us the first installment of an epic drama about a down on his luck, punchy boxer named Rocky Balboa who learned to win matches with heart rather than muscle. Since the debut of Rocky in 1976, many tourists traveled to the fame museum steps to run up just as the local Philly bad boy Rocky done many times before while in training.Flashing forward thirty years later, Sylvester Stallone gives us the final chapter in the saga of Rocky Balboa. Going into the film with some skepticism since it has been ages since Stallone has had a hit movie, could this sequel possibly taint the memories of the underdog hero for so many, now adult, fans of the series? Would many fans come barreling out screaming for Stallone to give up acting and get a hobby like his action hero counterpart, the ""govenator,"" or would they be cheering once again believing all odds could be overcome? Rocky Balboa gives a familiar feel of compassion the way the first film did, rather than the poor attempt of Rocky V. Never really getting over the loss of his beloved Adrian, who is the one Rocky draws his strength to overcome the odds, Rocky decides to come out of retirement to infuse hope back into his life. When current champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, learns of his return a match is quickly set up to capitalize on a fictional computer simulated fight that announces Balboa as the winner. Whether or not Rocky wins the fight is not the important image of this film, but rather the feeling Rocky leaves the audience when he leaves the ring for the final time. He inspires the hopeless to never stop giving up hope; that overcoming any obstacle is possible. Rocky again instills even those now older of fans to still dance around the parking lot, after the film has ended, throwing punches.When the credits role, fans will be left with satisfaction of a proper send off for the Philly fighter, once again proving ""Nothin' is over 'til it's over.""

973,Shadow_Storm,Rocky is a Knock out,8,21 December 2006,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This movie stays true to the Rocky franchise's roots and feels every bit as much like a Rocky movie as the first few did. It's actually quite nostalgic and blows all other nostalgia style movie adaptations out of the water. When the theme starts the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.But what makes this movie really good is the heart it shares. The theme is about remembering the past, savoring it, but moving forward taking what you've been given and becoming your own person. It's about heart. Or to sum it up best, as Rocky himself said....""It's not how hard you get hit, it's how hard you can GET hit and keep moving forward!"" The movie was SUPERBLY written. From start to finish it dove deep into Rocky's character. And make no mistake about it, it was ALL about Rocky. Pauly was back to his old habits again, and really made the movie feel like all the other Rocky's. He had his issues, but was still Rocky's best friend and right hand man. Pauly was also good comic relief at parts.There were some things I thought could have been done better. I thought that they could have portrayed Rocky's new opponent Mason ""the line"" Dixon with a lot more depth. That's not to say they failed by any means. They gave him just barely enough characterization. But still, I kind of felt like I didn't know enough about him to root or cheer for or against him. But there were little tidbits about his back story just enough to make him an opponent for Rock.Another thing is that I thought Rocky had 3 sons and not just one. And I also thought that oldest son wasn't named after Rocky. I was confused with that. I would have also liked to have seen more of Rocky's training regiment and gotten to know his trainer like we had gotten to know and care about Mickey. I believe that portion of the film was cut way short. Possibly for the sake of time.But otherwise it was a GREAT movie. There are a lot of morals in the film that we can all take from in our daily lives. That is what gives this film it's passion. It's passion and it's heart is the best attributes it has to draw on.There is also some excellent cinematography that is used during the final fight. I believe after this movie, we will begin to see a lot more of that kind of cinematography show up in other films. It is a fabulous effect that is not only eye appealing, but also adds intensity to the scene.The actors were pretty good in their performance. Sylvestor Stalone and Pauly's actor were so good that I expect them to have another Acadamy Award each by the end of the year.It's a definite must see, especially for any kind of fan of the Rocky series.

The crazy thing is that I had never seen any of the Rocky movies walking into this film, and while I may have missed some inside things here and there, I could still totally follow the film and was able to enjoy it completely.

The movie WAS very well done when it comes to the production aspect of it, i'll give Stallone that. But as far as the entertainment aspect, and the movie itself, it was just boring. Aside from a few moving moments, the movie really had nothing going on. Even during the final fight of the saga, it basically just skimmed through the whole thing. The training for Rocky was basically a 30 seconds of nothingness. Also, this film copied wayyyyy too many things from the first film.

Sly can act and nails Rocky Balboa with genuine emotion and realism.I have to admit my eyes filled up at one point. I consider myself not to punk out when watching movies but this one got to me.Rocky Balboa is all about heart. It holds a great message for dreamers and people with ambitions.This movie shows us that although our goals and dreams may seem impossible to people around us, they are very much achievable dependant on how determined you are in wanting them. Compose yourself, do not be afraid, prepare for the obstacles, stay strong and hold enough fight in your ""basement"" and you will get there.Of the great speeches Sly delivers, there was one that was particularly personal to me. It helped me with a real life problem i am faced with - I am going through a tough time at work and have been ""hit"" hard by the crappy management. By watching this movie i have learnt to take the hard hits and not to do the thing I've been doing thus far - pointing the finger and blaming it on somebody else.""Life will beat you down to your knees but its not about how hard we hit but how hard we can get hit and move on"" .............................Brilliant.",Rocky Balboa

His son, Robert Rocky Balboa Jr kinda lives in the shadow of his father, he is not doing so well in the business. And he only get jobs because he is the son of Rocky.When Rocky sees an animated fight between him and the World Champion, where Rocky actually wins, the spirit and passion for boxing gets brought back. He decides to fight again. He gets mocked and laughed at, so Rocky decides he wants to prove that he is still capable of boxing, and fights Mason ""The Line"" Dixon,which is the world champion in a Exhibition fight.This movie was very inspirational, Sly probably made the best movie of 2006. When you you've done something you love almost all your life, and decides to retire, the passion still wont go away, rocky carried a passioned beast inside him and the animated fight woke that beast to life. He felt he had no other choice than fight Mason.So what I think this movie was about is that you can't just give up something you've done all your life. You just have to do it, and you don't give a damn if your getting mocked at for doing an bad job, you will still do what you love. -Do what you love, and never quit.9.5 out of 10.Ulrik.

Stallone is actually able to convey the key message of the movie with just one phrase that sticks. He manages to avoid many of the so typical Hollywood plot patterns that would have cost a lot of the movies credibility. Instead he shows great skill in understatement and concentrates on drawing the characters fine lines. This is a movie worth of getting on DVD I think. It is perfectly suited as an occasional motivator on rainy days. The Fight is never over.Sidenote to Mr. Stallone if allowed: Please don't ruin this incredibly unexpected good saga ending with another bad scripted box office motivated piece of embarrassment.

As an avid Rocky fan I have to say that this is a much better way to end the Saga of Rocky Balboa. It is the same formula that built the empire. Emotion plus hard training = victory of the spirit. Somehow it works again; Rocky VI reminds us that it is never too late for ""one last round"". At first when I had heard the premise of the movie I was a bit wary, due to the advanced age of Stallone, I was hoping much more that his son would step into the ring, and Rocky would coach him as in Rock V, however I believe that this made a much more touching and pertinent story. Characters from the previous Rocky movies show up, and it is a real treat for the true Rocky fans that will get more out of this movie than the casual observer. Going the distance, is a term that is used in boxing, meaning going all the way, 10 rounds, (used to be 15). It is important theme to remember. One obvious thing that I noticed surprisingly left out of the film was the reasoning that Apollo died in the ring when he tried to make a comeback in an exhibition fight, one almost the same as Rocky's in this film.",Rocky Balboa
980,kuhlio13,Heart Filled Glory,8,19 January 2007,"Sly truly hit a home run with this movie. It was full of positive emotion throughout the film that had me laughing, crying, and on the edge of my seat. Although I think the training montage could've been better, overall the movie was brilliant. I thought bringing back Marie was a good touch and helped Rocky develop a good male/female relationship (not romantically) that was missing from his life. Paulie was his usual self with great humorous one liners and a little heart thrown in as well. Everyone should see this remarkable film and watch it for what it really is.....magic. Good work Sly. I never doubted you for a second.",Rocky Balboa
981,dan-knight-1,Balboa is Victorious,10,23 December 2006,"Beautifully filmed and acted Balboa takes us to places in Rocky's life that go well beyond a clichéd love story, well beyond a good vs. evil boxing match, it takes us to the darkest spots in an aging mans soul and shows us truly what this guy is made of. It's a story of loss, it's a story of courage and more than that, it's an insighful and moving statement of the human condition. Stallone has written and epic ending to a legendary film franchise and he's more than done it justice.Being written and directed by Stallone, Balboa is truly one mans vision come to life. Some say rocky is actually Stallone, that he has projected himself that much onto the screen, injected himself directly into the character. Perhaps he has, that would explain that exquisite connection Stallone has to this character, and maybe Rocky is so popular because there's a little of everyone up there. Rocky manages to tap into a part of his soul that we all have but just can't seem to access as readily as Balboa does.So strong is the story that Stallone doesn't need to invent an evil nemesis. His rival, Mason Dixon, is a youg, cocky and a little misunderstood, but he's not a villain. None the less Balboa manages to create a nice, believable underdog story. All this while examining his complex and fractured relationship with a son that does not seem to have inherited Rocky's world view or tough streak. All this while examining his ongoing relationship with his departed wife, while examining Paulies sad and miserable last days filled with regrets.",Rocky Balboa
982,JesseRDumas,You gotta just let yourself get into it.,7,25 June 2007,"I watched this movie knowing full well that I wanted to like it. However, I must have been in a funny mood or something because I just couldn't look at the screen and not see a 60 year old Sylvester Stallone when I should have been seeing a grizzled but consistent portrayal of Rocky Balboa. Upon first glance, I saw a lot of hammy acting, some pretty awful lines, and largely just another systemized Hollywood Movie. What I was forgetting though was, if any movie is allowed to follow a system, it's this one. Sly all but invented the underdog makes good story in this way and when I watched it a second time, I enjoyed it much more. I focused more on the character and not the actor, and I notice much more of the consistency Stallone brought back to him. The first two movies in the series I consider to be the true interpretation of the boxer, the 3rd and 4th were more about posturing the character as an American hero than further growing the original character. In the 5th, Stallone attempted to ""dumb-down"" Rocky again and even though the film was not of high quality, I appreciated him trying to take Rocky back to his roots. I think he does a much better job of it this time around though in the 6th (and presumably last) film in the series. The production values were very good, I especially liked the realism of the final fight in their using of the HBO format and camera angles, and even though some of it was a little ham-handed, Stallone still knows how to inspire some emotion in watching this character of his overcome all the odds.So, in summary, if you're going to watch this movie, do so as a believer and try to ignore some of the cornier things and focus on the ""what if this really happened"" aspect of the story, and it will deliver on all fronts. Rocky is a great character in the history of American film, and when he came out for his curtain call after the last fight, it definitely brought a tear to my eye.",Rocky Balboa
983,muaddib9,Movies like this are why I became a filmmaker,10,21 December 2006,"I don't normally go out of my way to send out reviews of movies...but I have to say if you haven't seen Rocky Balboa yet...you MUST! First of all, it is rated PG...and it actually was....I mean, I didn't have to worry about hiding my children's eyes because of a gratuitous...whatever...ya know? Okay---so, It was THE BEST film I've seen in a long time...since...geez...maybe since...I don't know...maybe since Braveheart! If Stallone is ignored or doesn't win an Oscar for this movie, I'll never watch, vote for or speak of the awards again. The film harkened back to the original with a great script and character development...I can't say enough about the writing. Do you remember how the first one made you feel? Like you were in the life of the characters in Philadelphia? The simple wisdoms and UNscripted feeling you got...that which was lost in the later films...just great language. Stallone's acting was fantastic...yes...that's right...Stallone can act! In fact, Stallone wasn't there...just Rocky. This character has lived in Stallone so long, there wasn't anything or way in which Sly didn't know exactly how Rocky would feel or move or think...total character. Burt Young who plays ""Paulie"" was great as well, showing how all the crap he's dealt out over the years has haunted the character in very deep ways...along with quirky character habits and some surprises that are presented in such a tertiary way that you walk away from the film and only later giggle about them because you didn't realize it at first...like a relative in your own family...like, ""eh--that's just Pualie..."" only realizing later, ""Wait, I'm not related to Paulie...no one is!"" lol. Old characters are integrated into this film so smoothly and without pomp as to crate a fluidity between the first and last film that seems effortless for the audience. For example, does anyone remember the references in the first film to ""Spider Rico"" or who said, ""Screw you, Creepo!"" ??? These little things are tugged out of our memory like a childhood pal and brought to the fore of this film in way in which the familiarity brings a smile to your face. The clothes are great. Just pay attention to Rocky's suit coat. This is not an action movie...so those of you that want to see the Stallone blowing stuff up, should rent Rambo III (A great social commentary in its own way). But for those of you who like STORY and CHARACTER, you will love this film. And here is how broad the films appeal was, I went to see it with my 4 year old, Meadhbh, and she loved it. We've both been humming the theme song since we saw it. It took me all night, thinking about the script to realize the deep social commentary that Stallone has made with this film. There is much on how each one of us can affect changes that reach our far beyond our own lives, how we've lost that which made us great as a nation when we would connect with each other by making the most of what we can in our own little part of the world. Like, buying from local merchants and grocers, restaurateurs and retailers, instead of Mega stores, employing people from character rather than qualification (showing them the ropes and mentoring, instead of always hiring ready made employees), the inter-dependence we have on foreign workers and the GOOD balance that can create... the need for a man (in the case of the film) or a woman to work for self-esteem, pride for what you can do with your own hand, not taking the easy way or accepting handouts because you feel like the world owes you something...how having love is so, so precious and ...and how we should express and acknowledge that fact every day to those whom we love and who love us...how we cannot live by mere existence, that we MUST be challenged and if we are not, we must make challenges for ourselves that may seem unattainable...I'm not talking about conflict, rather, the defiance of complacency...There is an overall theme about how we should, and can, conduct ourselves in the world, everyday, in every way that is so gently presented as to not offend or feel forced. Rather it is given as a gift, a reminder of our better selves...even for those that are living that better path, it is a confirmation and reassurance that those actions, though never easy, are righteous. The movie is so good to look at and conversations so great to listen to, you almost forget that the movie has to end with the big fight. But then the music comes in...but then that trumpet comes in and when THE music kicks in, the whole audience was yelling, ""Yeah! Go Rock! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"" When was the last time you heard the audience engaged with a film at all? I sometimes feel like I'm in a theatre with the walking dead, where nothing goes on between the screen and the seats, no one leaves the theatre talking about the film. People left this movie smiling, crying, punching the air, doing the Rocky, victory at the top of the stairs dance...it was awesome!",Rocky Balboa
984,KryptoKO,Nominate Stallone,10,24 December 2006,"I can't imagine a more emotionally honest and vividly resonating performance than what Mr. Stallone gave us.The man captured our hearts, so how 'bout giving him the Oscar.But is it impossible? No, certainly not. Paul Newman did not win for ""The Huster,"" but rather for ""The Color of Money."" So why not Stallone for ""Rocky Balboa""? Stallone deserves the award. Not because he put so much time into crafting the character, but instead because he explored the depths of of a decent, genuine man, and in the process broke our hearts and built them back up again better than ever.He made us believe, made us cry, and made us feel good about being human. So how 'bout we support him taking the award he deserves.",Rocky Balboa
985,Skidogj,Do not wait this movie out see it in the theaters,7,21 December 2006,"I would consider myself i very big fan of Rocky, but Rocky 5 was, well not so good so i was a little nervous that this movie would just be the same thing and beat all the things that made rocky special by exaggerating those aspects. But don't worry this new movie was made and written extremely well, it had me rooting for Rocky just like I did in the first one. Stallone does not force the character and makes many interesting ties to Rocky 1. If you haven't scene Rocky 1 it may be good idea to see it before you see this one, and just because it is an amazing movie. I would recommend not waiting this movie out, its worth the 10 dollar ticket price.",Rocky Balboa
986,dpancoast,Very tender movie. Worth seeing if you are a Rocky fan.,9,21 December 2006,"This movie was a moving tribute to the life of Rocky Balboa and Sylvester Stalone is moving in his betrayal of a man who is aging and has lost the woman he loves and is trying to live life to the best of his ability without her. It sums up the aging baby boomer and that just because you get older doesn't mean you have to live without pride or respect. Rocky IS Philadelphia and the spirit of an American. Standing toe to toe and saying ""I am,"" will be one of the great movie quotes to be remembered. The fight was produced perfectly. It showed the vulnerability of Rocky but that the determination of the heart shines in the end. Americans have always overcome the odds and ""Rocky"" shows that you can overcome even the greatest of odds if you are determined enough.",Rocky Balboa
987,ram225,Back to the basics,10,25 December 2006,"Stallone does not give you a chance to figure out the plot like we did not already know what it was going to be. He nails it down in the first scene and allows you to sit back and watch the story unfold. Very emotional up and down like a hard breaking roller coaster it left no feelings on the table. Excellent ending, nothing to be ashamed about but I would like to have seen an alternate ending where he fights and wins but his heart breaks and he dies in the ring a winner. This would not give anyone the chance to try another Rocky movie because you can't beat this last movie. Great job especially with the surprises, it's a knockout. True Rocky fans will love this movie, it reall takes you back to the beginning.",Rocky Balboa
988,dercampb,"As a longtime fan of Rocky, a fitting end to a great icon",9,20 December 2006,"As a longtime fan of the Rocky Balboa movies, I have always admired and loved this character. He brings the never die, never quit attitude into our society that I truly admire. I have seen every movie more than a few times and this one lives up to the expectation that I had for it. It adds in the nostalgia needed with Adrian and a little of Mickey but brings along the new way of life for Rocky with his restaurant and dealing with growing older. It has it's truly great moments and quotes as do all the Rocky movies and the final fight is shot in remarkable fashion. This movie gives hope to everyone that first saw the movie back in the 1970s and is beginning to grow older and moving on to a new stage of their lives. For me personally, as a 22 year old college student it effects me as I'm moving on to a new part of my life as well, with graduating college and facing the real world. Stallone did a great thing by bringing Rocky back for one more round after the 5th installment was such a disappointment. I recommend this movie to everyone who is not only a fan of Rocky, but a fan of a true underdog story. This movie will obviously be dealt with great criticism but I believe that for everyone who sees it, there will be a happy and satisfied fan on the way out.",Rocky Balboa

Did I buy the DVD? Yes.

Did I watch in the Big Screen? Hell yeah!
Do I understand what Sylvester Stallone says? Never.It is hard to describe how a movie with such slow pace moments keeps my attention for so long, to the point I just come back and watch again, still, Stallone empathy gathers the audience hearths to the point you begin to hope for him to win even knowing it is impossible due to his age, injuries and years out of the ring.The feelings return as I write, Rocky dealing with his daily challenges, teaching his son about life, reminding of wife and fighting, all the time.This is of the best movies I've ever seen, even with the extra endings, not necessary since Rocky wins even when defeat.",Rocky Balboa

(haha, I know, it's cheesy)",10,20 December 2006,"Everyone told me that this wouldn't be that great...well as an avid Rocky fan, I went to the first showing anyway...it was worth it! This movie is great and has the same style as the first two movies. The beginning lays low, telling a story up until a training montage and then the fight. It was amazing...they handled Rocky's age (and Sly's for that matter) perfectly. They also handled the absence of Adrian very well. Even though she is dead and not technically in the movie, the character of Adrian still plays a major role. Everything is there...this really was the best thing that could happen to the Rocky series...a much much better ending than Rocky V!!!! GO SEE IT!!!! Besides, how can you go wrong with quotes from the movie like the following: ""The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very rough, mean place... and no matter how tough you think you are, it'll always bring you to your knees and keep you there, permanently... if you let it. You or nobody ain't never gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... how much you can take, and keep moving forward.

While not necessarily a 'bad' movie, it wasn't exactly 'good' either. It definitely brought the Rocky series to a better-than-humiliating close, as was desperately needed, but in all reality the movie just wasn't too good. The script had many useless or boring scenes, for example pretty much everything concerning Rocky's son and another tangent that is half pursued for little to no reason (Marie and son). While the first fifteen minutes seemed like to-be-expected character development, the next 45 seemed to run the first fifteen over three times in different locations - the movie would have been much more watchable if it had been edited down to about 50 minutes and cut loads of the junk out.",Rocky Balboa

Sylvester is the one that should be nominated for an Oscar folks. Sylvester put his heart and soul into this film, and it shows. One of the best movies that I have ever seen, in all honesty. I can't think of one single bad thing to say about this film. I hope it does very well at the box office, because it deservedly should. Great script, great plot, great acting, wonderful surroundings/great camera shots & color of the city of Philly, the list could go on for days. $6? I would've paid twice that to see this film.

995,Chonwangsm,Properly ends the saga of Rocky!,10,21 December 2006,"To simplify the plot, Rocky is now the official owner of Adrian's Italian Restaurant (named after his deceased wife, respectively)and lives a humble life as a regular citizen in Modern Philadelphia. He struggles to cope with the loss of his great love Adrian along with his son Rocky Junior, who slightly resents Rocky for inadvertently making Junior live in his shadow. All of this occurs while Rocky transitions his life into helping others and their urban struggles within the 21st century. The story progresses when Rocky is than pitted in a cartoon fight against the current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon and is declared victorious, this hypothetical victory compels Rocky to enter the ring for one final bout against The Line in an exhibition bout staged by Dixon's publicists.The premise is a great homage to the original Rocky and properly ends the saga of Rocky with dignity and grace, which seemingly lacked within the last Rocky film back in the 80's. In terms of the acting, Sylvester gives a strong performance as everyone's favorite underdog, certain scenes so powerful it would probably make even the toughest of men get teary eyed. Milo Ventimiglia completely aces the role of Rocky Junior and convincingly plays the loyal son of the aging Rocky. Burt Young plays the character of Paulie no different than he did so many years ago, the same old' wise-cracking, slightly envious, and short-tempered Paulie (which isn't a bad thing). Can't forget Tony Burton's tough performance as Duke either, despite how brief it was compared to ""Rocky III"". Last but not least, Geraldine Hughes plays Marie, a character who substitutes Adrian as the leading female supporter of the franchise in a well rounded performance that should merit her some decent praise.With that being said, the rest of the newly added cast doesn't quite measure up to the acting ability that was most notable within the first Rocky's supporting cast and extras. Antonio Tarver was pretty good as Mason Dixon, his performance was more convincing to me especially if you compare his acting with that of Mister T's Clubber Lang (Although he wasn't that bad, since his acting was quite fitting for Clubber.) Certain scenes were filled with horrible acting and completely unnecessary dialogue (EX. the Bar scene with that disrespectful teenager and her band of pimps and whores). The whole ""Steps"" kid really couldn't act too well either, but it doesn't really bother you throughout the rest of the film if you maintain focus on what's really important.(Rocky...Ahem...)Aside from this, ""Rocky Balboa"" is a heart-filled drama that arguably stands side by side with ""Rocky"" as one of the greatest underdog films of this generation. ""Rocky Balboa"" isn't a film solely about the potential of will as it's predecessors, it now stands as the same film that also encourages self-respect and that the last thing that ages within a person's physiology is his heart, which can propel you beyond your physical limitations if you allow it to. This film is worth checking out in theaters and you won't be disappointed by the outcome of this fight.",Rocky Balboa

Now, after seeing this fantastic film, I can now have the last laugh. How wonderful, that Sly has gone back to his roots and given us a terrific storyline, direction, and performance. Bravo, Mr. Stallone, for giving us closure in a bittersweet, and championship way! In times when there is not too much to cheer about, we have been drawn right into the cheers for the underdog, again! How wonderful that felt. It is definitely a must see, and I highly recommend you do. The sentimentality of Rockys faithfulness to Adrian, his speech to his son, his very astute message, all falls into place at the end of this movie. Life lessons, from a simple man. I cannot wait for its release on DVD..........I will be first in line!",Rocky Balboa
