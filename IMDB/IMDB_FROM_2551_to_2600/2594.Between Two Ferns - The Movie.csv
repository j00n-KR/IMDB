It is crazy and it is ""behind the scenes"". And it is supposedly real life - but that is the essence of the original too. So if you are a fan of the show, you'll like this too. As quirky, crazy and out there as it can be.Obviously not for everyone, especially the uninitiated. This really is for Fans of a particular thing. You may think this boring and bad. And others will love it and be surprised by your view of it. Taste - it's a funny thing, quite literally.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
1,thesar-2,Where Zach's Ferns Glow,8,16 September 2020,"This is the Darker Roast I've always wanted to see.OMG, I haven't laughed this hard in SOOO long. Probably helps that I've never seen one of the clips this is based on. So, all these absolutely hilarious insult/interviews were all fresh for me.Zach Galifianakis plays himself, kinda. His normal annoying albeit oblivious nerdy character in which he absolutely, intentionally or not, insults his mega-media star guests on a local East Coast TV station. Whelp, he's given an opportunity to turn it into major L.A. TV show, but he must film 10 more of his bits while driving cross-country in two weeks.It's not the first time I've seen stuff like this, not exactly, but similar. In regards to movies, I'd categorize this with Private Parts, AL TV, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Wayne's World and Borat, but it was still 100% hilarious on its own. I kinda knew it was fake, but I believe part of the fun is to imagine this as ALL REAL. I did the same with Blair Witch, even though I knew it was fake...before the people did.If you're like me, this felt like a Muppet Movie but with live actors. It's that kind of zany road trip they normally took with exact resolutions. Highly recommended.***Final thoughts: Now off to watch a bunch of his shorts on the Inter-net. I didn't want to before I wrote my thoughts down on the movie. So, now, I'm released. Cheers!",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

3,ThomasDrufke,"Largely Unnecessary Plot, But Laugh Out Loud 90% of the Runtime",8,6 October 2019,"Not that there's a whole lot to review about a Between Two Ferns film, but at the very least it could be in the discussion for best comedy of the year, with Booksmart, Good Boys, and Long Shot. It's hard to believe there's only been a handful to choose from. The best thing to say about the film is that it's basically non-stop laugh out humor from beginning to end, with a plot around the jokes to be less than stellar. But if you're a fan of Galifianakis' dead pan humor, then the film is just for you.8.0/10",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
4,Floated2,Enjoyable but not great,6,1 October 2019,"Was thinking that the main premise of the film would have more interviews than a typical plot. Though it's a short film and there are some decent moments but not everything is funny. The interviews with the celebrities were roughly short and possibly the best part of the film. The bloopers at the end were good too.Wasn't expecting much, it was decent but what it was but could have been a lot bette given its hype.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
5,matthewssilverhammer,Worse than every episode...but still pretty fun,6,19 June 2020,"The wonderful internet show gets the Christopher-Guest treatment. The interviews are (of course) hilarious, and they let us know which celebrities we can like because they are willing to laugh at themselves. The story, however, is not nearly committed enough to the absurdity of it all; instead, it seems to be going for the ""Baskets"" style of drama-comedy, which plain doesn't fit. Still, there's enough joy to be mined here for fans of the show...and the outtakes are gold.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

7,jtindahouse,Terrible cast with no plot makes this a disappointment,5,24 September 2019,"Zach Galifianakis is a bit of an anomaly to me. He can be absolutely hilarious in a movie, or he can be atrociously unfunny. And the key to which isn't usually the writing, it's the supporting cast. In 'The Hangover' for example (and don't get me wrong that movie did have fantastic writing) he was acting with not only brilliant actors, but actors who knew how to work off him. In 'Between Two Ferns: The Movie' the cast he is given to work with on the road trip section of the story is about is as bad as they come.The movie really is rocks and diamonds. When he interviews celebrities it is comedy gold, the rest of the movie though is bordering on garbage. I mean there really isn't anything apparent in terms of a plot and so all the movie has to go on is jokes, and then Galifianakis is the only one who even tries to say anything funny. It's almost like no one wanted to upstage him and so basically they did nothing. It makes for some extremely bland viewing at times.The fact that this isn't completely unwatchable is down to just how good the Two Ferns concept is. If you enjoy the skits then you are going to at least semi enjoy yourself. You'll basically just be like I was, which is frustrated waiting for the next one to come along. With some more care and effort and a better cast this could have been something decent.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

9,aidanratesmovies,"Nothing too grand, but an enjoyable romp",8,25 September 2019,"Nothing is great about Between Two Ferns, a film based off of a popular youtube sketch series from Funny or Die, but at times the film does prove to be a rather funny- even with its struggles along the way. At times the film definitely seems like a large scale excuse to make as many Between Two Ferns segments as possible, as it seems they are truly the highlight of the movie. But be that as it may, it is the film itself that somehow manages to make each segment funnier, even if the film in a whole is not grand itself. Its an enjoyable romp, with mostly fine and some overdramatic but fun performances. The cameo's of John Legend, Keanu Reeves, and Paul Rudd shine greatest in the film, with others falling rather flat. In the end however, Between Two Ferns is certainly worth a watch, and without a doubt will prove to at least make you laugh.

Based on the TV show where celebrity Zach Galifinakis interviews other real famous celebrities between two indoor plants, this movie depicts the (fake?) attempt of the actor and his crew to keep the show running. I guess it borders between reality and fiction throughout the movie.It's some funny stuff here. Lots of surprising cameos, including Keanu Reeves and Will Ferrell. This movie will definitely please just about everyone out there. And of course, Zach Galifinakis is definitely one of the top comedians in the game.

I know Zack's supposed to be a comic genius but it's the same joke over and over and if it was ever funny the first time it sure isn't now. He needs to be unemployed of come up with something new. This isn't cutting it at all.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
17,HabibieHakim123,The Ending Is Very Fatal,8,5 July 2020,"""This movie actually has an intention, the comedy here is pretty good and I really get the comedy, Zach Galifianakis is really funny, this movie is really really fun to watch and very enjoyable, but unfortunately this movie is not concerned with the ending, honestly this movie for me it's just wasting your time, the ending of this movie for me is very fatal, maybe this movie is only suitable to be enjoyed but not to taking seriously""",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
18,kjproulx,Hilarious! At Times...,6,27 September 2019,"Prior to his work in 2008s The Hangover, I really hadn't been following Zach Galifianakis' career. In my mind, that was the only version of him I could see when watching him in other films since then. Surprisingly, through films like It's Kind of a Funny Story or Birdman, he proved to his viewers that he may have a little more range as a dramatic actor than one might believe. Soon after his breakout role in The Hangover, Galifianakis turned to this little short-form internet show called Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis. While I was never interested in it, I looked back on a few episodes when I realized a movie was about to hit Netflix. Now streaming on Netflix, here are my thoughts on Between Two Ferns: The Movie.Promised a primetime television talkshow for conducting ten high-profile interviews with celebrities around the world. Between Two Ferns: The Movie follows Zach Galifianakis and his crew as he continuously makes his guests feel uncomfortable. That's the entire premise of the movie and if you're not into these interviews or find the dry humour of it all that funny, then this film will be a massive turn off for you. Personally, I busted a gut on multiple occasions throughout the duration of this film, but I also don't believe it really works as a movie.At a mere 82 minutes, this film comes up with dumb side plots to keep the movie moving forward, simply to eventually have you laughing during his interviews. The problem is that the interviews are very spread out and the narrative portion of the movie (which isn't all that funny) takes over quite often. As I said, I did laugh pretty hard a few times, but I was also bored in between each great joke. These short-form interviews are absolutely hysterical on their own and this movie makes me want to go back and watch all of them, but the structure of this movie just didn't work all that well for me.From Matthew McConaughey to Brie Larson, this is a film that relies on funny celebrity cameos to hold everyone's attention, and for that reason alone it gets a pass for me because everyone is extremely committed to the joke. In particular, there is a segment involving both John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen that was both awkward and hilarious at the same time. How far Galifianakis is willing to take some of these interviews is what truly made this film worthwhile.In the end, it's hard to recommend this movie as a movie, but if you just want to sit back and enjoy some nonsense to get a few good laughs, then yes, Between Two Ferns: The Movie is worth checking out. This would have worked better as a series of interviews stitched together to form a 90-minute run time, so the way this film is put together is the only real detriment. Filled with great cameos and en enjoyable main cast, this movie earns a pass from me. Check it out if you're in need of a laugh.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
19,nicholls905-280-546911,Funny film,8,20 September 2019,"Not a bad film, but it struggles to expand a brand that is short. Simple story with some very funny cameos in the mix. Sadly it struggles early on and it has a lot of work left to redeem itself. Flawed but some of the humour is funny, much like the shorts it is based on. You'll either hate the concept or enjoy it, no middle ground for the central character. The film should have been crazier, it feels slightly safe. I thought is good overall.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
20,Headturner1,Disappointing,3,22 September 2019,I love Two ferns and saw this. watched the trailer and thought it looked silly. I was right. it was awful. I didn't laugh once! Not even the interviews were funny imo. I watched a scary movie after and laughed for crying out loud. And they could have made the road trip funny at least since there were little celebrity interviews. Ya know I loved Reno 911 and was hesitant to watch a movie ut that was funny! It's hard to make a movie out of a short skit show but come on. Ruined me for teo ferns and I haven't watched it in ages so I don't even know of there are new episodes. But anyone who is a true fan will be disappointed. Ok edit to add to the guy saying this is dry humor like Larry David. That's an insult. David could do no wrong in my eyes. And yes the online two ferns is funny but this had no dry humour..I have to edit again thinking about it the David Lettrman bit was sota funny. That was my favorite part and he was unrecognizable.,Between Two Ferns - The Movie

23,johnnymonsarrat,"Funny in places, Not much of a story",6,20 September 2019,"I'm sure they could have made Zach a really good guy deep down in this film, who's just incompetent on his TV show, but they didn't.I did not want to root for him, or for his team, who are not given interesting backstories or a plot purpose.I sense that Zach sometimes chooses to play unlikable characters on purpose, and that must be a kind of comedy that others like, because it doesn't appeal to me.Make the protagonist likable. Set a clock ticking (the one in this movie doesn't count, because there's no real tension). Add madcap antics. End with something spectacular.To me, this film is like how some people insist that jazz is music. I guess dark comedy is a valid kind of comedy. I guess that appeals to some people.I'm sorry, it didn't work for me.Just off hand, I have a better story idea. Zach needs to sneak into the TED conference or a Comic Con to interview a famous woman. You begin thinking that it's just an obsession, but then it turns out that they recently broke up, and he wants her back before she marries Evil Celebrity. It's a reason for him to trek across country alone, but along the way (like The Muppet Movie, or The Wizard of Oz) he picks up unlikely companions.There's a lot of back stage antics, with traditional comedy not in the Ferns format. At the last moment, thanks to his new friends, Zach breaks into the conference, Oceans 11 style, and gets on stage to interview Evil Celebrity just before he proposes. Using his Ferns ability like a superpower, Zach nudges Evil Celebrity to admit to something illegal or have a breakdown (think Tom Cruise freaking with Oprah).

The premise was pitiful (Zach *owes* Will 10 interviews, so how is he able to negotiate something in return for them?), the plotting pathetic (see the instant reunion at the gas station), and there's virtually no themes or character development to speak of.

28,stevenrotherforth,Ali G did it much better,4,22 September 2019,"Between two FernsBetween two Ferns starts out promising but soon runs out of ideas very very quickly.
Starring Zach Galifianakis as a online celebrity talk show host, this movie reminded me of 'Da Ali G Show' from the early noughties.
However Sasha Baron Cohen's offering was much more cerebral.
There's even a subtle nod to Baron's work but this film pales in comparison.
In 'Da Ali G show' it appeared that the interviewed participants weren't in on the joke.
Here everything feels terribly staged and obvious.Galifianakis and his oddball crew travel across country interviewing and insulting celebrities along the way with the promise of making it big time if they deliver ten interviews.
The novelty soon wears off and the jokes land few and far between.
Sure there's the odd laugh out loud moment here and there but much of this movie is just too silly to laugh at.
I found this movie tedious but stayed with it just to see which celeb would pop up next.

Bang!"" star Scott Aukerman, ""Between Two Ferns: The Movie"" combines a number of ""Ferns"" celebrity interviews, with a bizarre plot involving Zach and his production team (Lauren Lapkus, Ryan Gaul, and Jiavani Linayao) interviewing celebrities across the country so Zach can have a coveted late night network talk show, as promised by ""Funny or Die's"" Will Ferrell, after the old ""Ferns"" studio is flooded.Celebrities interviews/appearances include: Matthew McConaughey, Bruce Willis, Keanu Reeves, Rashida Jones, Adam Scott, John Cho, Brie Larson, David Letterman, Paul Rudd, Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, Jon Hamm, Hailee Steinfeld, Tiffany Haddish, Benedict Cumberbatch (with the usual jokes about his impossible name) and Gal Gadot.The interviews follow the usual ""Ferns"" formula: incredibly awkward, with the guests deeply uncomfortable with Zach's questions (though most are willing to play along with the joke) and his lack of professionalism.Stick around for the in-credit bloopers, which are as funny as the movie, if not funnier.A must-watch for fans of ""Between two Ferns"", Galifianakis, or comedy fans in general.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

36,hunter-friesen,"""Between Two Ferns"" thrives in the limelight",6,25 October 2019,"What started as a joke and over the years became an even bigger one, Zach Galifianakis's long-running web series ""Between Two Ferns"" has been given the feature-length treatment via Netflix.Just like the show, the premise of the film is simple: Zach Galifianakis has been doing his web show for Will Ferrell's ""Funny or Die"" for over ten years now, making Ferrell millions in the process. Zach's true dream is to have a late-night talk show with a live audience and guests that appreciate him.To achieve this dream, Zach enters into an agreement with Ferrell. If he can get ten more episodes of ""Between Two Ferns"" delivered within two weeks, Zach will have his show. With no time to spare, Zach and his team set out on the road to interview all the celebrities they'll need for their final episodes.""Between Two Ferns: The Movie"" is directed by Scott Aukerman who co-created the original web series with Galifianakis and won two Emmy Awards for his directing.Making his feature directorial debut here, Aukerman does a respectable job. He keeps the story flying with a rapid pace, resulting in an 82-minute runtime that doesn't overstay its welcome.Even though the length of the film isn't the problem, sometimes the structure of it is. Just like the web series, the interviews between the two ferns are excellent and easily the best part of the movie. They're so good that you wish there were more of them and they weren't so dispersed between the other narrative segments.The whole thing feels like a ""Saturday Night Live"" movie from the early 2000s. The running gag that anchors the movie isn't enough for a feature film, so a few subplots and throwaway scenes are cobbled together to get over the hump. Most of ""Between Two Ferns: The Movie"" falls into this trap as most of the material is needless filler to pad the time. It's not an unforgivable sin, just one that could have been easily avoided.Written by Aukerman and Galifianakis, ""Between Two Ferns: The Movie"" follows the typical road movie plot. It's the one where the group heads out together to achieve their goal, some obstacles get in the way, the group splits up for a bit, they all get back together again after learning something about themselves, and everything ends on a happy note.Now, there are a few shakeups to this cliched narrative, but it isn't enough to make you care about what happens. The whole time you'll be wondering when the next celebrity interview bit will be.Fortunately, the interview segments are worth waiting for. The writing is top-notch and gives off the perfect mixture of deadpan awkwardness and hilarity that make you laugh both at and with those involved. Even as the jokes get crueler and the interviewee looks more uncomfortable, the self-parodying energy in the room will make you laugh every time.Despite being a role he's been typecast in for about a decade and has somewhat become a retread at this point, you can't deny that Zach Galifianakis is great as a lovable loser. The one thing different in this role compared to his rest is that he plays and pokes fun of himself instead of a character, making the jokes more real and edgy.The support group that makes up the production crew for Zach's show is comprised of Lauren Lapkus, Ryan Gaul, and Jiavani Linayo. They each are all pretty good and bring an improvisational group vibe to their performances that play well off each other and Zach.The movie may have the most star-studded cameo list of all time as it strolls out celebrities such as Matthew McConaughey, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brie Larson, Paul Rudd, John Legend, Keanu Reeves, Jon Hamm, Chance the Rapper, Tessa Thomspon, and several others. They all do a great job of reacting to the various insults hurled at them in their brief moments of screentime.""Between Two Ferns: The Movie"" is a small experiment that somewhat does and doesn't justify its existence. As you would expect, the interviews are the best part and the rest kind of just goes by without much fanfare.But, if you have to sit through sixty minutes of decent material to get twenty minutes of comedy gold, I'd suppose that's a pretty good deal.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

40,theredsky,Between Two Ferns: The Movie Review,4,21 September 2019,"Between Two Ferns: The Movie is unfortunately, a forgettable comedy film. Here are the positives. The best part about this movie is that most of the celebrity interviews are pretty funny. The segments with Matthew McConaughey, John Legend, Paul Rudd, and Peter Dinklage are pretty funny while the other celebrity interviews are entertaining at best. There are some outtakes during the end credits that are funnier than most of the film. That's kind of disappointing that your outtakes are funnier than most of your film. I think Zach Galifianakis does a good job with what he is given and helps keep this film afloat. The film has this mockumentary feel for it and the camera work compliments that. It's shot in a way a mockumentary would be and it's refreshing. The film can be self aware at some points and doesn't try to make itself bigger than what it is supposed to be. The film does what it needs to do and then it is over. Here are the negatives. The story is kind of lame. It's another one of those ""redemption stories because a character did something embarrassing"" that has been done to death. The film doesn't do anything to establish itself as something different. Everything other than the celebrity interviews is incredibly boring and starts to drag heavily. Fortunately, as it starts to drag even heavily, it switches to another celebrity interview. This also leads to a weird structure issue though. It does start to feel out of place when it changes so suddenly but it does lead to better scenes. About 75% of the jokes aren't that funny which is unfortunate since it is a comedy film. Like I said earlier, I got a bunch of laughs out of the outtakes than I did most of the film. The editing for this film feels very amateurish. It has a bunch of quick cuts that are distracting and obnoxious. This also leads to a pacing issue. It's weirdly paced due to the quick cuts and awkward structure. It's these issues that really drag the film down. Overall, Between Two Ferns: The Movie has some funny sequences but is held back by a cookie cutter story, lots of boring moments, and awkward pacing. I give Between Two Ferns: The Movie a 4/10.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
41,Wililjam,The best thing about the movie are the interviews....,6,20 September 2019,".... unfortunately, the movie lacks interviews. The plot of this movie is simple and kind of boring, not going to lie about that. What makes it watchable and funny are the interviews as well as the blooper reel at the end, other than that there's basically nothing funny about the movie.I thought the idea of making a Between Two Ferns movie was a good one, and it was, in theory. I just expected something else. I expected more interviews and The Office vibes, but this was just a mess.If you like the web-series, you'll probably enjoy the movie, maybe. I'd suggest just skipping through to the interviews, instead of watching the whole thing. 6/10, just because of the interviews and the blooper reel at the end.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

Some of them are funny some are really flat.This is really basic road trip movie with a conflict and resolution. If it wasn't for a few really short interviews it would be a total dud. 75% of the jokes are flat as hell they even do the gag where a driver gets distracted and almost hit a truck like that unoriginal. Haha she can't play the trumpet funny noise, funny right? No. It's just full of very average jokes like Funny Or Die can do way better.The ending makes absolutely no sense instead of being funny as hell with the resolution and small time left in the movie they do an other small conflict subplot for no reason that resolves in 3 minutes and they try to make up for this absolute unfunny ending with bloopers.Very dissapointed.

54,andrewburgereviews,Laughing with him,8,23 September 2020,"The best thing about Scott Aukerman's ""Between Two Ferns: The Movie"" is the fact that if you decide that you don't like it, you come out as a high-brow. Taking Zach Galifianakis' FunnyOrDie web series and turning it into a full-length feature might not seem like an obvious idea, but it's biting humor is smart enough to be offensive only to the ones to stiff to join in its laughter--it is a brilliant exercise in passive-aggressiveness.The movie expands the stand-alone episodes into a cinematic universe of sorts where Zach is challenged by his FunnyOrDie boss Will Ferrell to bring him ten interviews in two weeks and he will give Zach what he always wanted. An actual late night talk-show--suits, studio band and the New York City background included. A show where people will laugh with him, not at him. Because like Ferrell explains: ""this works because the people are laughing AT him"". This depreciation is what fuels Zach and is also what makes us feel good watching him stoop so low like when he is picking on the way Benedict Cumberbatch looks.What follows is Zach taking his crew--who are almost as awkward as he is--on a road trip to get this thing done. The pace is blistering fast. This movie is constructed on small set-pieces and the focus of each one is nothing more or less other than delivering a brash, sudden celebrity insult. The victims include Matthew McConaughey, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brie Larson, Tessa Thompson, John Legend, heck even David Letterman joins in. But the best thing about his interviews is how they are a challenge to the guest to arrive with a comeback. I mean, come on, Zach paints himself as an easy target which he is, but he is also direct in its insults up to the point where it's scary.The movie is not too concerned with continuity. That might be annoying but it is also its way of being unpretentious--it does not take itself seriously. It is more or less a rotation. Get in the car, get in contact to a celebrity, make fun of said celebrity, rinse and repeat. It's repetition is obvious but it's also brutal and efficient. This is not about the plot as much as it is an excuse to have some fun. The moments I loved the most were the actual interviews which do nothing to advance the plot but are nonetheless the heart and soul of this movie. It's also refreshing that the repetition does break its predictability occasionally, like when Jake Gylenhaal couldn't make it to the interview--something about his last name, I won't spoil the joke here--or when Zach meets Chrissy Teigen in a bar.While I feel I could spoil some jokes because their poignancy comes from the delivery rather than their construction, it is still better I won't only to maximize their effect. Comedy is all about timing and this movie is an example of that. So many of these jokes are obvious, but if he wouldn't have done them, it would be a waste. In a way, you feel Zach speaks like an average Joe meme-ing celebrities straight to their faces.This is not a cinematic universe--obviously. But it is quite the fascinating alternate timeline. One where TV shows are still delivered by tapes, there is a TV station called FPATV--which is not pronounced how you might expect by the way--where being friends with Kanye West is a sad joke and John Legend is actually scary.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
55,alexqueens,Surely everyone's capable of better than this...,1,30 October 2019,"Having watched most (if not all) celebrity interviews between two ferns within the last decade, it would seem that a feature length movie taken on the road, interviewing a series of celebrities, would have been a natural progression to revitalise the show for the mainstream.
Unfortunately, it stinks of comedy desperation.
Despite this been written by a seasoned comedy writer and comedy actor, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was written by a couple of young film students aspiring to be comedy screenplay writers.
The junk filler 'movie segments' in-between interviews was just so ridiculously bad that it cancelled out any enjoyment I may have gotten from any of the interviews.
The best interview by far was with Matthew McConaughey, and that was featured in the opening scenes. Everything from then on went downhill.
I honestly forgot everyone else that got interviewed until the end credits rolled with all the interview bloopers, which was the only second highlight of this hour-long trash. I laughed out loud at that Paul Rudd joke.This is basically poor and sad writing for someone who gave us golden comedy interviews with Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, Jerry Seinfeld, Charlize Theron, Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, etc.At least Will Ferrell was in it for some comedic relief here and there.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
56,LProductions-837-667666,Strictly for fans,4,22 September 2019,"I think you have to be a huge fan of Galifianakis to enjoy all 82 minutes. While I find him generally quite annoying, he does have a strong supporting cast which provides much of the humor, even with a hit-or-miss screenplay which just stops rather than have an actual ending. The cameos vary from undetectable (where the hell was Bruce Willis, whose name appears in the credits?), to truly disappointing (a waste of time with David Letterman and Jon Hamm), to some truly funny episodes, but few rise to the opening sequence with Matthew McConaughey. Personally I found the Benedict Cumberbatch segment the best, particularly with the various distortions of his name (i.e. Benefit Lumberjacks). Will Ferrell, another love-him-or hate-him guy, really drags things down in his few scenes. As stated elsewhere, the outtakes which run over the last few minutes of credits provide some of the best moments. Best viewed with your finger on the fast-forward button (you'll miss some of the cameos, but many of them amount to little more than a few seconds of screen time).",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

The thing you won't like about this movie is the relationship between people, you could add 20 minutes more and develop the characters more and their relationships, in that way, we as an audience we are more into the movie.
Zack was great and everyone was, they knew what he should do.
And yes after 70 minutes of following zack dream to get his own show, in the last minute he left his dream for his friend. Ohh how clichéd this is.

And it's not particularly an enjoyable mess. Just left me scratching my head because it feels like Zach himself knows it's not that funny, but he put it out there because he doesn't care. But the subject matter of movie also hints that he does care deep down despite how stupid and silly the entertainment business really is.So watching this was like having cognitive dissonance for an hour + but thinking it's kind of funny to have cognitive dissonance for an hour + when you think about it.

The same can not be said for the movie, which was just plain not funny and a complete waste of time unfortunately.This movie followed every single cliche you could possibly imagine from a Hollywood movie. You know exactly where the film is going the entire time. The main driving force for the story is that they have to go cross country to get 10 between two ferns episodes shot so that Zach can get his own network talk show, so its a roadtrip movie... How fresh. The characters are bad, forgettable and unfunny. There is zero special about the filmmaking. One of the aspects of the movie is it's shot like they are making a documentary about the making of the web show, similar to something like the office, but unlike the office, it has zero value within this movie. It serves no purpose at all and was just another lazy excuse for a few gags. It also is completely inconsistent, the whole movie isnt shot in this documentary style, they make a point of Zach asking the make believe filmmakers to shoot everything, but then there are scenes presented like a normal movie. which begs the question why even bother in the first place?At one point in this movie, Will Ferrell (Playing the manager of funny or die) says ""people like to laugh at Zach, not with him"" in reference to what made the show so popular. As if to suggest that is the driving force to what makes the web series so popular, is the fact that Zach is such a goofball. But that's not the appeal at all. The appeal is it's Zach making personal jokes about real stars careers and just plain being rude to them, having Zach shush the president of the United states, telling actors how terrible they are, in one episode he even asked hilary Clinton if email is the best way to reach her. Brilliant. It may be staged but undeniably it's still funny to see these things that you would never see happen in a more traditional interview, the show provided something unique and somewhat daring, and funny. So it's so bizzare to me that the writer and director of this movie (who is the same as the web show) didn't seem to understand the aspects that made the show so popular in the first place. I never saw Zach galifinakis as a character in the original series. More as a spokesperson for these jokes, jokes that people would make between there friends except Zach was directly speaking to them. not the Zach we see in this film, this bumbling goofy idiot type character who has a dream of making it big and becoming a real talk show host, Errm, who cares!!The best part of this movie is of course the interviews themselves. But even they are not nearly as funny. They just feel more ""polished"" and some of them are less than a minute long. The movie was also not self aware in the slightest. I think it would have helped this movie along if they got alot more meta, you know have actors play up the way they are perceived by audiences, but they dont. Instead they just chose to go the absolute laziest route possible and have the actors just sit there quietly and take the abuse. The scenes between the interviews could have been filled with birdman like self awareness with actors mocking themselves. Such wasted potential here.Overall this isn't a movie I can recommend, maybe for the ferns episodes within the film but you can probably just watch them online. In total they probably take up like 15 minutes of the film.Honestly this movie kind of ruins between two ferns going forward. When the show chastises actors for there bad choices on making bad projects from nownon. It's going to be really hard not to see the hypocrisy considering they were the same people who thought this was a good idea.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

However, the ""Between..."" clips are as usually great. The best part of the movie though is the outtakes during the credits at the end. It's a long outtake sequence during which I laughed uncontrollably for several minutes.So, even though the ""movie parts"" of this movie are substandard, the movie is still well worth a watch if you like Galifianakis humor.

This fictional behind the scenes look at how it's made doesn't break new ground or even highlight what makes the series so funny. There were a couple of decent laughs, but too much of the film mined backstories and introduced new characters without coming up with enough to justify the premise of the film. The best scenes in it were those that featured interviews with celebrities. But you could just watch the series for these. Will Ferrell, whom I'm also a fan of, played one of his stereotypical characters as well. This is basically that comic-documentary we've already seen a thousand times (The Office, Modern Family, etal). If you've never watched the original series, do. It's cringeworthy comedy at its best.

106,lewismillican,If you get Zach you'll get this!,7,1 October 2019,"Between two ferns was a throwaway sketch show in which small time interviewer Zach Galifanakis conducted a series of obscenely insulating interviews with Hollywood stars. It was never a show in particular that was destined for a feature length movie. Not because it couldn't necessarily be executed, rather because there was no glaringly obvious potential plot line. However, Zach (writer and lead) and Scott Aukerman (Writer and Director) managed to muddle together a seemingly decent plot. Although slightly baggy at times, at the core it still holds its own - as Zach and his crew shine through.Zach's pipeline dream of becoming a mainstream late night television host is the driving force behind this movie. Due to Zach's internet success producer Will Ferrell gifts Zach his own late night tv show in return for 10 more interviews in current format. The only caveat is that they have to be conducted within two weeks, leaving Zach and (predominantly) his crew to go about sourcing and interviewing within this ludicrous time frame.Needless to say Zach's truly bizarre character creation is at the heart of this movie; and he is at his very best. Literally anything can come from this mans mouth, like verbal diarrhoea, Zach cannot control himself. From his obscenely out of place food and beverage orders, to his senseless lack of common sense he is utterly hilarious. It would always have been difficult to tap into comical themes other than the interviews themselves within this movie - and at times it was indeed baggy. However, the saving grace besides the already existing Zach Galifanakis are the support cast who needs just as much credit, with their stoney looks and physical acting without their stellar performances - the jokes would have stood up.Running at only around one hour and twenty minuets, it's not exactly a Greek odyssey - but it doesn't intend to be. It is still a laugh fest, with its physical humoured quips. So if you are in the mood for a late night comedy trip - Zach Can provide. A prerequisite to your enjoyment is that you have to like or at least be onboard with Zach's character, If you buy into his awkward, desperate or dare say slightly autistic persona, it's a must see on every level.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
107,adamgill-45012,Many Yucks Ensue,7,31 August 2020,"I never saw the original series, so I had no preconceptions for this ""show"". I was actually drawn to it by the bloopers reel that does the rounds now and then. This actually smacks of British humour - the back and forth on clearly inane comments and thinly-veiled insults is up there with what the Pythons were really good at. Unfortunately, it also comes across as a bit ""The Office"" - scripted, unscripted segments and segues work - most of the time. The one-liners are good and the premise that Jake Gyllenhaal mis-spelt his own name - with too many A's - that was worth a chuckle. I actually preferred the interviews than the interlocking elements - they are too staged and too corny. As mentioned in other reviews, the fact this is only 75 minutes works in it' favour. A solid 7 out of 10 for the premise - the 3 that's lacking is in the presentation and execution.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

So before the movie became available on Netflix, I literally scoured the YouTube for all the available episodes of Between the Two Ferns and thoroughly enjoyed them, sometimes laughing so hard while recalling some questions later that Zach throws at the celebrities with amazing deadpan delivery. I just couldn't wait for the movie to be out. And what a disappointment it is...When Zach 'temporarily murders' Matthew M and destroys the set, he agrees to do 10 episodes on the road with celebrities and in return would get a TV show of his own. So when he hits the road with his crew and I was expecting fun to begin. But it only ends up being another self realisation journey movie laboured with cliches like never give up, don't lose your friends, believe in yourself type mushy stuff. There is some episodic fun only when Zach is recording the interviews and well the rest is just a 'sanitised by hollywood so you can have happy endings' (to quote Zachy B himself from the movie).So if you are expecting ROFL type fun, stick to the YouTube episodes or fast forward the movie all the way to end titles.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

2. How are they making this idea a movie?After finishing the movie, these questions weren't answered, and I am annoyed that i wasted my time on this movie. The plot made no sense, the script was awful, it was INCREDIBLY boring to look at, there were multiple continuity errors, etcetc. I feel as if this would have been decent if it was at least funny, but the jokes were so awful that I had to pause the movie MULTIPLE times to comprehend how awful a joke was.This movie lacked any heart from everyone involved, and it shows by just watching it. I literally cannot find any positives within this film.

I was about to switch it off at what I thought was the end, but noticed an additional 7 minutes to play remaining.Letting it run... the bloopers accompanying the credits are the best part of the entire movie. Laughing out-loud on the plane for the first time in the experience, the interview out-takes were by far the funniest part. Not completely sure if it was a result of watching the full movie or if they would be as funny going direct... but the casual candor and genuinely funny exchanges between ZG and his stars is hysterical.The movie is watchable, but if you are tempted to turn it off, jump to the last 5 minutes for some genuine laughs.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

157,lolordpro,Why the bad reviews?,9,20 September 2019,This movie is hilarious. One of the best comedies ive seen this year,Between Two Ferns - The Movie
158,adhdawesome,A deep dive into the shambling reality of capitalism,7,16 December 2020,"This film, while seemingly non-ideological and an attempt at absurdist humour, actually takes up acknowledging the absurdity of liberalism itself. It follows Zach's life, in which he braves the anarchic wasteland of celebrity. Along with his crew, he deconstructs the american dream. His friend and producer has to suppress her emotional trauma in order to maintain productivity. The ""dumb"" cameraman and coded autistic (I think?) boom operator create a love story that's deeply fluid, illiberal, and the denial of typical film's form. The group gawk at the absurd wealth of the rich and famous, constantly playing a game with working people, who in one great revolution in the final act, grasp at some power. While this film is rather funny, it's comedy doesn't necessarily lie in the performances or direct assaults on ideology, but rather, its subtext. I believe that with a certain perspective, we can admire the cynicism exemplified by denying the form and crushing the peaceful ideal of rugged individualism. 7/10.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
159,omranagurgaon,Zack steals the show,7,21 September 2019,"The film adaptation of the popular internet show ""Between two Ferns"" is quite entertaining. Zack Galifianakis's character of ""Zack Galifianakis"" is a mixture of Michael Scott and Brick Tamland. Zack is hilarious, wicked, childish and amusing. No doubt the guest appearances of all the celebs is a delight to watch. There are many one liners in the movie that make you roll on the floor. Apart of Zack's brilliant comedy, Will Ferrell keeps you entertained throughout his appearances in the movie.
After the movie is over and the end credits are rolling, we can see the amount of fun the celebs and the creaters of the movie had while filming it and how hard it is to keep a straight face while you being interviewed by one of the funniest guys in Hollywood.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

163,peterlemass,The funniest movie I've seen in a long time,10,25 October 2019,"They don't make many comedies like this anymore. Great combo of the at times slapstick-absurd while also having many really clever jokes and writing.
The movie adds quite a few more layers on top of what was already a very funny show. Some great performances from Zack and Lauren Lapkus. Plus lots of amusing celebrity cameos.
I've watched it 3 times at this point and each time it has made me laugh. I also notice some new thing I hadn't spotted in the previous viewings.
Congrats to all involved. Well worth checking out if you want a good laugh.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

Even better than the show & I don't think anything would top that but this movie did. It also has a office vibe. It's a nice surprise to see all big hollywood stars in a movie. I think we need more movies like this. 😍,Between Two Ferns - The Movie
170,PuddyWoody,Mildly amusing,6,3 October 2019,I'd never heard of this as a show before but thought I'd give this a go. I quite like awkward comedy and there's plenty of that on show here. Lots of big stars involved and Will Ferrell pretty much steals the whole thing as he has a habit of doing. But in reality it isn't that funny. Couple chuckles is about it. In fact the bloopers at the end is the funniest part of the movie which kinda tells you what you need to know.,Between Two Ferns - The Movie

172,paristsim,Really enjoyed it despite my expectations,9,20 September 2019,"I was expecting it to be mediocre, as happens often when a successful original transfers into something else. However, this was really good and I enjoyed it and laughed hard many times. Will Ferrell was awesome too. As was the inclusion of behind the scenes of between two ferns in the end. At least giving everybody a glimpse of what has been happening behind the scenes of the original legendary internet show, pure joy and laughter. Zach is a genius in his simplicity. I hope this somehow goes on, even though it seemed like Zach wanted to leave that behind with this movie. As far as I see he achieved quite the opposite, people wanting even more! p.s. all actors were great in this and seemed to enjoy it",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

176,infodaveklein,Not funny tho,2,7 January 2021,"I love Zach, so this is kinda sad.Even if it says that it's not scripted,it is obvious that it is when you watch this movie.
Since the celebs never really take part in the conversation or answer anything, how is this supposed to be funny?
I love more subtle comedy that makes you think but this was crap 🤷‍♂️ SorryThe connecting parts that make this the ""movie"" is also more or less unnecessary, then I'd rather watch the show",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
177,jacksonwhindman,"Fun, funny interviews and a forgettable plot",7,24 September 2019,"I feel people are expecting way to much of this film, I found it to be one of the funnier comedy movies of the year. This was a fun watch, the interviews had some of the best B2F bits ever in them, lots of great one-liners that had me in stitches. The plot wasn't anything new, the old ""odd friends taking a road trip with a deadline to save it all"" has certainly been done before but the addition of people like Lauren Lapkus as side-characters kept things interesting enough to not drag the whole film down, and the interviews were kept as the main focus which also worked in its favor. I thought the parts with real actors playing characters of themselves were quite funny, especially the depiction of Will Farrell and his over the top Funny or Die empire. Overall a fun film with lots of great guest stars, some really funny writing, and a forgettable but not irritating plot.",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
178,yahia-40372,"It's a comedy, and it was damn funny",9,1 October 2019,"I noticed most of the reviews are annoyed about the plot, and yes it should've been a bit more complex, but anybody who understood the jokes would've had a blast, and a lot of quality humor is what anybody would expect from a comedy",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

There was no sense of comedic timing which absolutely killed a huge comedic aspect of Betweeen Two Ferns, and the Interview scenes are impossible to compare to the internet between two ferns series as the editing is much different and takes away the magic of the awkward comedy.

183,snseinfr,Not what you expect,4,20 December 2020,"Why make a movie called ""between two ferns"" if the story has nothing to do with it? I was a fan of the original show just because the interviews were so funny. This however was just....boring. Really really boring. I mean...they had such great stars there and we had probably 10 minutes of actual ""between two ferns"" from an hour and a half of the movie!! In the movie thay said they did 10 interviews and actually met the celebrities. Where the hell are those interviews!?? Why not actually show them? The blooper trailer was the only funny part. This movie is just a sad boring ...thing",Between Two Ferns - The Movie

is this America's answer to Extras?",Between Two Ferns - The Movie
196,billyhewison98,"Watch it, but watch while you're doing something else",5,24 September 2019,"HEY! Are you ready to put something on in the background that you don't have to pay attention to because there's absolutely no plot to speak of?
If you answered no, then why are you reading this review? But if you're not being contrary just for the sake of it, then this is the film for YOU!Look, its not that great, its not that bad either. Have you seen ""Between 2 Ferns"" before? Because if you have, its just that premise for 80 minutes. Does it get tedious with the parts where the interviews aren't happening? Sometimes. But guess what, you're not meant to be that invested in it, just whack it on it the background while you do something you ought to have done a while ago but haven't because the task seems too dull. Like organising your tax returns. I would 100% recommend having this film on in the background whilst you file your tax returns. Its got to be done, may as well have Zach Galifianakis asking his celeb mates dumb questions playing on ya laptop on the other side of the desk while you do it.
The basic premise of the film is that Galifianakis needs to do ten ""Between 2 Ferns"" interviews in the space of 2 weeks or Will Ferrell (who, in a brand new direction for him, places a bit of a nutter) won't provide him with his dream Late Light Talk Show. Not exactly winning an Oscar worthy winning script. but it's light hearted comedy.
Directed by the guy that hosts ""Comedy Bang Bang""- Scott Aukerman, all the cast put in good performances- however- the real fun is seeing the bloopers at the end where the celebs react genuinely to the ludicrous interview questions.
To elaborate on the cast performances (as to reach the 500 word minimum. Seems like a lot doesn't it? I mean nothing I'm going to mention from now on will convince you to watch Between 2 Ferns: The Movie starring Zach Galifianakis, the part about tax returns is where its make or break for you- the dear reader) the 3 supporting cast members all put in solid performances, you honestly would believe they detest Galifianakis at parts. Admittedly, I remember not the actors names nor character names- only that of ""Cam"" the camera operator. An example of the type of light hearted humour Auckerman and Galifianakis bring to this film.
Will Ferrell does his usual performance where he portrays a fictionalised version of himself as a psychopath. No surprise here, Will Ferrell plays the role of Will Ferrell very *Fer-rell* (its meant to say well, but pronounced phonetically. Yes I am counting the words. Honestly there isn't that much to say about the movie. Just watch it. Or don't. Do whatever you want. And that motto doesn't just apply to ""Between 2 Ferns: The Movie starring Zach Galifianakis; dir Scott Aukerman"", that motto applies to your life as well).
Yeah all the guest interviews are great too, especially the one starring your favourite celebrity!To conclude, watch this film if you want to- or don't.

The story and some jokes seemed really predictable, but they were still fun nonetheless. The run time of only 75 minutes helps the movie not get boring as it is paced pretty fast. The celebrity interactions are the strongest point imo, but they felt rushed because of the fact that each celebrity was there for like 2 minutes at a time.Overall, if you are a fan of the show, you should give it a try and see what you think.
