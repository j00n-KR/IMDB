0,SnoopyStyle,Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger have chemistry,5,21 October 2013,"Charlie (Jim Carrey) is a meek Rhode Island state trooper. His wife cheats on him and he refuses to acknowledge it. Even when she leaves with her lover, Charlie still raise the kids as if they're his own. One day he just snaps, and a new alter ego named Hank emerges. Charlie is assigned to escort fugitive Irene (Renée Zellweger), but all kinds of chaos follow Charlie and his alter ego Hank.The Farrelly brothers are trying to merge multiple personality with their usual gross out humor. The multiple personality bit isn't that funny by itself. When Hank goes off at first, it was mostly stupid, inappropriate, but importantly unfunny. Jim Carrey does get a few workable jokes in when he's with Renée Zellweger. She's great reacting to Carrey's insanity.I'm tempted to say that it would better if Jim Carrey would just be Hank. If Irene was forced to rely on Hank, I think there's a funny movie in that. The multiple personality is really just forcing the stupidity onto the movie.","Me, Myself & Irene"
1,mark.waltz,You know his revenge is going to be good.,8,12 January 2021,"This delightfully crude comedy is the perfect revenge film for those of us who were too nice growing up who finally just had enough. That's just the first 20 minutes when we learn the hard facts of motorcycle cop Jim Carey's life, avoiding confrontation, losing his wife, being treated with disrespect in his community, and finally being diagnosed with a split personality. The only ones who respect him are his three loving sons who obviously aren't his.He is sent out of town where he encounters runaway Renee Zelwegger, on the run from mobster Daniel Greene. It'll take a wacko like Carey's second personality to protect her when violence breaks out. They end up on a journey that combines the best of both sides of his persona, although he has an interesting way of stuffing a chicken, not to mention tenderize beef.This is the type of comedy that you laugh at in spite of all its absurdities, slapstick that combines the styles of all the greats and utilizes Carey's often irritating ability to contort his face into odd positions to perfection. Rex Allen Jr. provides a fascinating narration, reminding me of the narration of those fabulous Disney documentaries from the 50's and 60's. The film goes all over the place as it starts off in one direction and moves to several others. But once you get the gist of what is going on, it's a sensational journey that requires a lot of popcorn.","Me, Myself & Irene"
2,kosmasp,Two Face Carrey,8,1 February 2021,"Wait a minute didn't he ... in Batman? No he didn't! It was Tommy Lee Jones! Carrey was the Riddler! But at least you got the movie right, if you though that. In this case it is not a two face as in literally, but more in a schizophrenic kind of way. Having said all that if one can pull it off, it is Jim Carrey.And we have another movie with the former Bridget Jones star. She was the it girl for a while back then. Not sure what happened, but it seemed Renee Zellweger went missing for a long time. Saw her in something recently, where she is superb again. This of course is a comedy where there is not so much acting one would say. Still she does a solid job supporting the madness of our lead actor. As do the others, a solid cast all around. Fun little gem that is now over 20 years old ... was nice revisiting it and some of the things it made fun of (you people/racism, discrimination, wrong notions about an illness and so much more ... and all packed in a comedy! Kudos!)","Me, Myself & Irene"
3,lee_eisenberg,Oh ack,5,21 February 2006,"""Me, Myself & Irene"" is the sort of movie at which you die laughing the first time, but after that you're not sure whether you want to laugh. I wouldn't know whether or not it makes fun of mentally unstable people. Basically two hours of Jim Carrey pulling off various and sundry gross stunts as a schizophrenic cop, it's not a bad movie, but not one of his best either (for gross-out humor with the Farrelly brothers, he reached his peak in ""Dumb & Dumber""). Renee Zellweger had only recently come into my conscience when I saw this, but she's done better since. All in all, this movie is harmless, but not one that I'd recommend above others.","Me, Myself & Irene"
4,jboothmillard,"Me, Myself and Irene",4,12 September 2005,"An interesting idea for a comedy, a man's constant struggle to struggle with schizophrenia. Basically Officer Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey) has lived a long while with the loss of his wife sleeping with a midget and lots of other stuff. He has held in a lot of emotions over the years, and now he has had too much put into his head that he has created a new personality in his head. He has created a monster opposite of himself, Hank Evans, who does everything that Charlie couldn't, and wouldn't. Worst thing that happens is that Charlie falls for troubled Irene P. Waters (Renée Zellweger). Soon enough, Hank takes a fancy too. Also starring Chris Cooper as Lt. Gerke, Massena PD, Robert Forster as Colonel Partington and Tony Cox as Shonte Jackson. Two of the most amusing scenes are when Hank is first created, and the battle between him and Charlie, but the rest of the film is just cheese. Adeqaute!","Me, Myself & Irene"
5,ccthemovieman-1,"'Not For All Tastes,' As They Say",6,23 October 2006,"What a wacky movie! It gets most of the ""stars"" in the rating here for the entertainment value of the film. As low-brow as it is in spots, you never get bored watching it. In a nutshell, Jim Carrey plays a schizophrenic Rhode Island state trooper. There are lots of outrageous scenes in this film, most of them in the first half. Some, such as with the cows or Carrey taking a poop on a neighbor's lawn, are memorable in a perverse way.Rene Zellweger is too profane to begin with, but she settles down as the story goes on. She and Carrey sure make an ""odd couple.""We get the PC baloney here of the black characters all being smarter than the white folks. The black kids cannot speak a sentence, however, without some profanity it it. The people who made this film are known for their sleazy comedies.That overall sleazy feel to this dark-slapstick comedy makes me hesitate to recommend it, but if a lot of ""language"" doesn't bother you - or dildo jokes, believe-it-or-not, this will entertain you.","Me, Myself & Irene"
6,BA_Harrison,The poor taste didn't bother me; the lack of decent gags did.,4,27 July 2019,"A comedy about schizophrenia: in very poor taste? Of course... but this is a Farrelly Brothers film, and being low-brow and unpolitically correct is what made them famous. But where their earlier films - Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, and Dumb and Dumber - were side-achingly funny, Me, Myself & Irene is desperately devoid of genuine laughs, with only the occasional giggle to be had throughout the whole film.Jim Carrey plays Rhode Island state policeman Charlie, whose wife has an affair with a black dwarf limo driver (Tony Cox, the funniest person in the whole mess); Charlie lives in denial, even when his wife gives birth to three black babies, and is heartbroken when she finally runs off with her lover. Suppressing his feelings and avoiding confrontation for years after, Charlie finally snaps, becoming alter ego Hank, who is the exact opposite of his mild-mannered persona. This causes all kinds of problems when Charlie has to protect pretty Irene (Renée Zellweger, looking mighty fine) from corrupt policemen working for her criminal boyfriend Dickie (Daniel Greene).Carrey goes through all his tried and tested routines in the search for laughs, pulling silly faces and performing some impressive physical gags, but the whole thing smacks of desperation, the star trying too hard to compensate for a lacklustre script. Zellweger is very likeable as always, but isn't really given much to do other than be the woman in peril.4/10 for Zellweger and the cameos from hotties Anna Kournikova and Shannon Whirry.","Me, Myself & Irene"
7,paul_haakonsen,Average run-of-the-mill comedy...,5,9 June 2014,"If you watch ""Me, Myself and Irene"" without any expectations, then the movie delivers well enough, because this is certainly no milestone in American movie history. That being said, then this is a fairly average Jim Carrey movie, that have several similarities to ""The Mask"" in ways.The movie itself is entertaining for what it is worth. The storyline is good, consistent and has a good flow to it. And it is the type of movie that requires no brain activity from the audience - so just sit back, switch to autopilot and be mildly amused for about an hour and a half.Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger do have good on screen chemistry and they make the movie work.The characters in the movie were unique and well portrayed on the screen, most of them being eccentric and quite out there. Which worked out nicely, because their oddities and eccentricities were a main driving force to the movie.The jokes in the movie are straight and to the point, and the comedy is often bizarre and semi dark humor. It is a movie that will have you smiling and put you in a good mood, but hardly the type of comedy to have you in tears from laughing so hard.""Me, Myself and Irene"" is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy if you also enjoyed ""Dumb and Dumber"".","Me, Myself & Irene"
8,Quinoa1984,Black guys talking German,8,18 June 2000,"This film is not only the funniest film of the year (so far), but one of the best of the year (so far). Jim Carrey's comedy antics (not seen this good in 3 years) makes a come back thanks to the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) who make their 2nd collaboration. Here, Carrey plays a gentle police officer who gets screwed in life so many times, he grows a new personality that is incredibly bad. Carrey plays 2 characters here- 1 (Charlie Baileygates) is a little funny, but the second (Hank) brings out one of Carrey's best performances yet. Renee Zelwegger is a good co-star for Carrey (coincidentally, Carrey dated Zelwegger off set just like how he dated Lauren Holly off set of Dumb and Dumber). The best scenes include the hilarious sex scenes, and Carrey's kids, who are straight A black guys who curse in every other sentence and yell German at each other. Split personality is at it's best here.","Me, Myself & Irene"
9,edwagreen,"Personality Minus-Me,Myself & Irene **1/2",6,23 March 2013,"This picture would have been even funnier had it concentrated on the theme that was depicted at the film's beginning: a woman runs off with the chauffeur that drove her and her husband to their home after their wedding. When she had given birth, the children born were black. He keeps the kids as she rides off into the sunset. How he raised the three black kids would have really been hilarious.Instead, the movie goes downhill quickly as Irene, Renee Zellwegger, enters as a young lady falsely accused of working with someone in cheating the EPA. There are corrupt cops and all in this farce.Jim Carrey, our Rhode Island police officer, has a split personality. Much of the film is devoted to his hitting himself as he assumes a double identity. When he is the slick Hank, he sounds like Clint Eastwood with that gravel voice.Then, there is Whitey, a young guy who attached himself to Carrey and Zellwegger, claiming that he hacked his family up. Thank goodness that was a bogus story as is the rest of the film.","Me, Myself & Irene"
10,sunwarrior13,Charlie And Hank,8,15 October 2012,"Six years after Dumb and Dumber, Jim Carrey reunited with Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly for this anarchic comedy with a hint of romance.Me, Myself & Irene is a comedy starring Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger. Chris Cooper, Robert Forster, Richard Jenkins, Daniel Greene, Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon, and Mongo Brownlee co-star to play key supporting roles. It is about a Rhode Island state trooper named Charlie who, after years of continuously suppressing his rage and feelings, suffers a psychotic breakdown which results in a second personality, Hank.Charlie is a good-natured Rhode Island state trooper who likes helping people. But years of internalizing his frustrations about his work and his family have caused Charlie to develop an alter ego: Hank, an abusive, violent, sexually compulsive police officer. Charlie can keep Hank at bay with medication, but just barely. When Irene finds herself in legal trouble through a series of misunderstandings involving her ex- boyfriend, Charlie must escort her on a long drive to New York for questioning. After Charlie loses his medication, he and Hank wind up vying for her affections: Charlie wants Irene to marry him, while Hank has more brutal intentions.Me, Myself & Irene will satisfy Jim Carrey fans eager for a return to the contortionist slapstick that made him a star.It does deliver enough laughs to merit a recommendation although the Farrellys' usual attention to disability that will surely be misread as insensitivity to disability.But the big shock here is how flagrantly unoriginal the movie is.That is why a viewer may not totally enjoy it as a whole.","Me, Myself & Irene"

12,Theo Robertson,Very Funny Film,7,31 March 2003,"This is an unPC very funny film from the Farrelly brothers which gets off to a very funny start with ethnocentric gags about a black midget called Shonte and then keeps up the pace . As you`d expect from a film like this cruelty to animals and physical handicap feature highly on the laugh list .
Perhaps the most surprising thing is Jim Carrey who normally wants me to throw my TV out of a window everytime he appears on it , Carrey is good in the role of the meek Charlie and I can`t help thinking if he toned down his "" Jerry Lewis on speed "" act he`d be a very accomplished comedy actor in the same vein as Ben Stiller . In fact Carrey is better than just good as Charlie , he manages to bring pathos to the part . Of course as soon as Hank appears Carrey does go OTT slightly but never enough to make me want to kill the television So a good comedy by the Farrelly brothers , not their best ( That`s THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY ) but it made me laugh , and I`m someone who normally hates Jim Carrey","Me, Myself & Irene"
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Jim Carrey, the Farrelly brothers & a disaster of a film",6,15 November 2004,"We all(well, most of us, at least) know Jim Carrey... the master of physical comedy and facial comedy. We also know the Farrelly brothers, who've done a lot of R-rated crude comedies lately, and who directed Carrey earlier in Dumb & Dumber. Now, imagine that these meet, in a movie that's typical for the Farrelly's, with Jim acting the way he always does(which is usually funny, even in bad movies). Sounds great, right? Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. The film has virtually no laughs at all, as it's taken to the extremes and beyond... constantly. The humor tries far too hard to be funny and shocking, and winds up being disgusting and embarrassing. The only laughs come from the three black teens in the film, one of whom being the nearly always funny Anthony Anderson, probably better known from Scary Movie 3. Their characters talk like black rappers or kids from the ghetto(swear words, yelling) but are very intelligent, at the same time. This has a bit of a comedic effect, even though it's just a gimmick and it does wind up getting old, about half-way through the film. Carrey himself has some funny bits, but too much of it is just not him; he's supposed to make funny faces, say funny noises and jump around. That's him at his best. The first Ace Ventura film is a good example of this, as is Liar Liar. However, in this film he doesn't get to use his talent for physical comedy all that much. Half of the physical comedy is just him being beaten up... it was good to see him fight himself, but there was too little of it. And why does half of the humor center around Carrey being humiliated? The director of Ace Ventura 2(Steve Oedekerk) made the same mistake, and look how (un)popular that film was. In conclusion, the only right director for Carrey is Tom Shadyac(Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty), at least in my opinion. The plot is daft and poorly paced. The acting is nothing special. The characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes. The dialog holds very few memorable quotes, though there are a few. All in all, the film is just bad, by Carrey's and the Farrelly's standards(and all other standards, for that matter). I recommend it only to the biggest fans of Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers. 6/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
14,view_and_review,Carey Starts Sliding,4,12 June 2014,"You know... as hot as the Farrelly brothers started with Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, I don't think this movie was nearly on par with those. I know I may be in the minority here, but Me, Myself and Irene didn't strike a chord with me quite like the two movies prior to that. Jim Carey was on top of his game at that time but maybe on the down slide. Bruce Almighty was the only real hit he did after Me, Myself and Irene. Could it be that MM&I started the downward slide? Or was it him taking a role of God that started it?Back to MM&I. The jokes just fell flat and I've never been a fan of Renee Zellweger. There were some funny scenes but nothing memorable. Hey, it could have just been me. I think that the late 90's-early 2000's was a transformation of tastes for me. At any rate, I wasn't impressed with MM&I.","Me, Myself & Irene"
15,anaconda-40658,Jim Carrey As Two-Face.,7,2 July 2015,"Me, Myself and Irene (2000): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Chris Cooper, Anthony Anderson, Robert Forster: Twisted and vulgar comedy featuring a scene where a chicken is seen penetrating someone's anal track. Gimmick title regards two personalities of one factor and the obvious presence of another. Jim Carrey plays a Rhode Island state trooper who gets married but loses her to a black midget limousine driver. He fathers the three black children but viewed as a joke when his neighbour's dog craps on his lawn. When he snaps his aggression forms Hank who retaliates by driving an illegally parked truck through a window, and craps on his neighbour's lawn. Central plot regards his transporting Renee Zellweger across state and the bad guys that pursue them. Great background story gives way to typical road movie and bathroom humour. Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly address split personalities but this isn't a masterpiece like their Kingpin or There's Something About Mary. Carrey is hilarious but subdued in road movie clichés before his heroic climax. Zellweger is a prop with the personality of a rock. Chris Cooper is wasted as a villain. Robert Forster came off an Oscar nomination for Jackie Brown and is greatly underused here. The black children display some growth and intellect. Vulgar yet amusing take on today's headaches. Score: 7 / 10","Me, Myself & Irene"
16,FlashCallahan,"Just because I rock, doesn't mean I'm made of stone.....",2,22 August 2015,"Charlie is a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality. He is otherwise mild- mannered and non confrontational until somebody or something pushes him a little too far. That's when his maniacal alter-ego Hank takes over. Charlie is assigned on a routine mission to return alleged fugitive Irene back to upstate New York, but they wind up on the run from corrupt police officers. And their escape would be a lot simpler on everybody involved if Hank didn't keep stepping in at the most inopportune times....The kings of bad taste are back with another inane comedy, poking fun at ethnicity, disability, and mental health problems, all for the pleasure of you, the viewer.The Farelly Brothers have had one of the luckiest careers in Hollywood, because with a lot of hindsight, they only really made one decent film, Dumb And Dumber, and I believe it was only successful because Jim Carrey became the biggest comedy star in Hollywood at the time, and it didn't hurt that his face was plastered everywhere.So they try to recreate the pseudo magic of their initial movie and fail, miserably. And it's because they don't listen to the cardinal rule, less is more.So they lay on the smut, racism, misogyny, and innuendo as thick as they can, and instead of raising smiles, it raises eyebrows in the fact that this was a tent pole release in the summer of 2000.Carrey gurns and gurns as if his life depended on it, Zellweger looks bemused throughout, and the rest of the. Farrelly regulars do the same thing that they do in every one of their movies, do random things because it seems to be funny.It's a shame that people with real life disabilities, whom appear in these 'films', whether they suffer from spina-bifida, or albinism, don't realise that they appear in these movies to be mocked by the moronic fans of this sort of unfunny trash.There are good comedies out there, but they are few and far between. It's about time we turned our backs on so called comedies trying to push the taste boundaries to give us all a laugh.This didn't. It offended me, and no doubt, several others.","Me, Myself & Irene"
17,Aaron1375,"Has its moments, but like most Farrelly brother movies it has a lot boring scenes.",7,6 May 2003,"For my money, Dumb and Dumber was the best Farrelly brother movie.  It was nonstop comedy all they way through and they maintained it with almost no scenes that didn't have any comedy.  This movie has some really funny scenes, but it also has a lot of pointless scenes where no joke was made or if it was it fell flat.  Carrey is great, but he is always good in comedy. Rene is okay as his love interest, but for the most part she isn't very funny.  This is the story of a guy who suppresses his anger after his wife leaves him for another man.  She also leaves him the kids who are obviously the children of the other man.  His anger reaches an explosive level and finally comes out in the funniest scenes of the movie.  After that he has to escort Irene (Rene), and there are people after them.  The jokes after the great coming out scene are hit and miss for the most part.  Some of the jokes are great, others not so good.  This movie is also a bit to long, another Farrelly brother flaw and this movie really runs ten or fifteen more minutes than it should have.  For the most part though it is a rather good comedy to watch.","Me, Myself & Irene"
18,Wuchakk,"Unnecessarily crude, but funny and entertaining",7,10 September 2013,"Released in 2000, ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is a Jim Carrey comedy about a Rhode Island motorcycle cop (Carrey) who has a mental breakdown after allowing people to walk all over him for three decades. He develops a split personality consisting of Charlie, the nice guy, and Hank, the take-no-crap dude. After going on meds, he's given the assignment of escorting Irene (Renee Zellwegger) from Rhode Island to upstate New York. The two become fugitives as Charlie/Hank falls for Irene. Meanwhile Charlie's three black sons get involved in finding him.The film works because Carrey gives the schizophrenic role all his heart and the Farrelly brothers (the directors/writers) go to extremes with the gags, as usual. There's quite a bit of crudeness and cussing, but I was able to overlook it and laugh. Most of the cussing comes from Charlie's three black sons who are veritable geniuses, but maintain their homey lingo. It's not meant to be offensive, but funny; you either get it or you don't.The film also works because we can all relate to the struggle within between wanting to get along with people and not wanting to be taken advantage of. It's somehow enjoyable to see Charlie morph into Hank with his take-no-sheet attitude. I also like the way the film ties up the schizophrenia issue. The answer is to maintain a balance between being overly nicey-wicey and overly forthright & intolerable. The ""middle road"" is the key.This was the first film I saw Renee in and she really shines here -- petite, sassy, smart and beautiful. I also like the funny three black sons and the addition of the dubious albino dude.FINAL WORD: ""Me, Myself and Irene"" loses points for being unnecessarily crude, but -- if you can overlook that or laugh with it -- it is entertaining and funny. It places well with Carrey's funniest movies, although the first Ace Ventura film, ""The Mask"" and ""Liar, Liar"" are better.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Rhode Island and Vermont.GRADE: B+","Me, Myself & Irene"
19,Mr-Fusion,"A lot of this is so dumb, but I laughed harder than expected",7,8 August 2015,"""Me, Myself and Irene"" doesn't deviate from the Farrellys' trademark scatological humor, but that works to a surprising degree here. It'd be unfair to say that Jim Carrey is the cog that makes this all work (seeing as there are so many other necessary pieces to this puzzle), but he's playing his physical comedy to the hilt, and it's some entertaining stuff. The guy even gets into a convincing brawl with himself. It's beautiful. But it's not just Carrey; Zellweger fits pretty well, his three sons steal every one of their scenes and it even has space enough for a persistent dildo. As a road movie, it's not nearly as focused as ""Dumb and Dumber"" (really tends to wander), but there's some genuinely funny material here.7/10 Oh, and the music that plays when Jim Carrey snaps is priceless!","Me, Myself & Irene"
20,whpratt1,Jim Carrey Was Great,7,28 April 2007,"Have not watched very many films of Jim Carrey and this particular film had me laughing through out the entire film. Jim played the role as a Rhode Island State Policeman who lives in a very modest home, a box, and just got married to his bride and carried her over the threshold and things started to happen which I would never have dreamed could happen. It seems that after their first, second and third son was born that the marriage went down hill for some odd reason. Renee Zellweger,(Irene Waters) meets up with Officer Bailey Gates/Hank Evans) played by Jim Carrey who has a split personality and is constantly fighting with himself and Hank Evans. The rest of this film is filled with a great comedy situations in motel rooms and cars being pushed into gravel pits and unbelievable train rides and some way out comedy skits. Enjoy","Me, Myself & Irene"

Carrey owns this film & its his performance that never lets the momentum go down. Its amongst Carrey best works! Also charming & irresistible is Renée Zellweger.

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Funny some moments, and somewhere they loose it",7,11 January 2004,"Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie. But there was just something wrong. I'm not sure what. I always get a great laugh from Jim Carry. And this had more of a cute and sweet side. ""Liar Liar"" was a great comedy that I nearly died laughing at. It was more physical humor than in ""Me, Myself, & Irene"". Maybe that was the problem. I don't know. But it's watchable.7/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
23,=G=,Quantity over quality and a giant step back for Carrey.,4,11 January 2001,"""Me, Myself, and Irene"" is a lame road trip comedy with Carrey and Zellweger wandering into one silly situation after another. The film fails as a romantic comedy, relies heavily on crass shock humor, is devoid of sophistication, has a paper thin make-it-up-as-you-go-along plot, lacks cohesion, runs 30 minutes too long, wears itself out, and makes Carrey's performance look like a bad impression of a young Jerry Lewis. In short, the flick is very passable and will play best with young audiences. Not for the jaded.","Me, Myself & Irene"
24,MovieAddict2016,The Farrelly Brothers' Worst...,6,9 October 2003,"""Me, Myself and Irene"" is the Farrelly Brothers' painfully unfunny and inconsistent follow-up to their smash hit ""There's Something About Mary."" They seemed to be on a roll--""Dumb and Dumber"" was a hoot, ""Kingpin"" was a blast, and ""Mary"" was outrageous. Now they've sunk into what they so marginally avoided in their previous films--downright crudeness and stupidity.This isn't to say that their previous efforts were lacking crudeness. But what made the films funny were the characters and their good intentions (or bad intentions in the case of Pat Healy). ""There's Something About Mary"" is a strong R-rated film, no doubt, and the hair gel scene would turn off almost every viewer, I think, if not for the innocence of the characters and our attachment to them--by the time we come around the scene we already cared for them. The characters in ""Me, Myself and Irene"" are given little background, and when they do it comes off as a very superficial life.It starts with an 18-year veteran of the Rhode Island police named Charlie (Jim Carrey). After his wedding, Charlie gets attacked by a vicious midget--who also happens to be black. The little man is overly-sensitive and very insecure, and so he goes after Charlie with his belt. Yeah, it's sort of funny, but not as funny as it could have been. Anyway, we find out the midget man is a member of MENSA. Charlie's new wife is the head of MENSA or something. Love at first sight.Charlie's wife gives birth to three black children. Charlie realizes that they are black (""They have a tan all year long,"" says a neighbor) but, being the sensitive and insecure person he is, he simply ignores the fact and tucks it way back in his head. Eventually his wife leaves him for the midget. Years later, Charlie's kids are older. They're foul-mouthed but incredibly smart. Me thinks making them talk very educated would have actually made it a great bit funnier than having their every other word be the almighty F-word, but I won't complain.He finally snaps under pressure and a new personality erupts--Hank. Hank defecates on the neighbor's lawn, sticks a little girl's head in a pool of water and almost drowns her, crashes a car through the front of a building, and so on and so forth.Enter Renee Zellweger as Irene, a runaway golf course attendant being chased by criminals who thinks she knows too much about something. The cops are in on it and so Charlie and Irene run away. Only problem? Hank is about to appear again and wreak havoc.The film resorts to low-brow humor, but it's just plain mean, and not all that funny. ""Mary"" was sweet and funny and crude and funny and mean and funny. ""Me, Myself and Irene"" is just plain mean and mean and crude and crude and a bit funny. I laughed a few times but they weren't big laughs. This is a very dark comedy that perhaps portrays the Farrelly Brothers' taste for darkness, but forgets to portray their humor. There's a scene with Charlie trying to kill a cow that's funny, but what's with the ongoing jokes about ""Whitey"" the albino? I don't really mind the political incorrectness--it's just not funny! They eventually use Whitey as a cheap plot device who becomes their friends, as if they felt sorry for making fun of him. Isn't one of the pinnacles of the Farrelly's humor political incorrectness with no reservations?This movie resorts to something I thought I'd never see in a Farrelly Brothers movie--conventional plot devices. The plot behind the mess is just distracting from the rest of the movie. Everything from Whitey the albino to Dickie the gangster is all so typical. And the film's real problem is that it thinks Hank is funny. Every time it starts to lose steam it pulls out Charlie's alter ego and tries to use it as a last-ditch effort for laughs. Hank is not funny. Now, the possibilities of what Hank could DO are very funny--but the Farrellys only use him as a device for a few laughs, sex jokes, and physical fights between Charlie (both fighting through Carrey's body) that is funny but underplayed. I would have paid eight bucks just to see Carrey fighting himself because he is good at physical comedy--but the movie seems to drag on with the idea of split personality disorder without ever making good use of it.I wondered how much funnier it would have been if the Carrey character, Charlie, had two alter egos who fought inside him. Then there would be almost constant changes. But Hank appears only when the film starts to run out of steam. And sadly, this film is always out of steam.Note: The Farrellys have inserted various cameos in this film. Owen, a mentally retarded man who knew the Farrellys as boys (and yes, the inspiration for Owen in ""Mary"") can be seen in the background, as well as John J. Strauss, co-writer of ""Mary,"" and Lin Shaye, who played Magda in ""Mary,"" and Pat Healy, the name of Matt Dillon's character, is in the background; and finally, the ending where Charlie is looking for his thumb in the water is the original ending of ""There's Something About Mary,"" with Ted (Ben Stiller) getting hit by a bus. The script called for Mary and passersby to start searching for vital parts of his anatomy (including one major part), but they had neither the time nor budget to do this. When ""Irene"" came around, they knew it was their chance. It didn't quite work as planned.2/5.","Me, Myself & Irene"
25,sddavis63,"Not Jim Carrey's Best, Not Jim Carrey's Worst",6,18 August 2014,"I have very mixed reactions to Jim Carrey's work. Sometimes I think he's quite good, other times both his performances and his movie leave something to be desired. On the other hand, I adore Renee Zellweger. She can make even a bad movie worth watching - for me, anyway. So, Zellweger was in this. It was worth watching.It was a decent movie and sometimes quite funny. Carrey's character Charlie is an officer with the Rhode Island State Police - ""the best law enforcement agency in the country"" as we're told many times. But after a marriage breakup, Charlie's life begins to fall apart. He's left with his three black sons (his wife had an affair and then dumped both Charlie and the kids) and just tries to get through life. Then he meets Irene (Zellweger) - a fugitive from justice who Charlie has to return to New York State. You see where this is going - and then comes the twist, as Charlie suddenly develops a split personality, as the arrogant Hank makes his appearance. Irene and Charlie (and Hank of course) end up on the run from corrupt cops.It's a fun movie. It's no comedic masterpiece, and it's a little too long for this type of movie (almost 2 hours), but it's quite watchable. It's also very crude at times. Charlie's three sons have an obviously favourite word (let's say it starts with ""mother"" and includes two more syllables and it occurs over and over and over.) Basically, it's neither Carrey's best movie, nor is it his worst. (6/10)","Me, Myself & Irene"

28,lesleyharris30,"Not the Farrelly brothers Finest,but Still a Lot of Fun,",8,30 July 2010,"Me,Myself and Irene is a great movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast.Its another hilarious comedy from the Farrelly brothers,while it is certainly no Dumb & Dumber or There's Something About Mary,it is still a very fun film with their usual style of offensive comedy,sugar coated with pure laughs.Jim Carrey is fantastic as Charlie/Hank, he was able to play both characters very well despite the little time he was given to jump from Charlie to Hank,and that just shows what a great character actor Carrey really is,and there was also surprisingly great chemistry between him and Renee Zellweger.Its not hilarious all the way through,and I think at times it got a bit more serious than it needed to be,the parts revolving around Irene's ex-boyfriend and any of his associates were very dark and contained little to no moments of comic relief,which I found unnecessary. Certainly not the Farrelly brothers or Jim Carreys finest work,but Me,Myself and Irene is still a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. A friendly cop with a split personality must protect a woman who is on the run from her ex- boyfriend while also finding out how to control the other part of him.

31,sol-,"Him, Himself & Her",5,2 December 2017,"Diagnosed with a split personality disorder, problems arise for a milquetoast cop when he forgets his medication while escorting a state witness in this road trip comedy from the Farrelly Brothers. As others have pointed out, the film is a little like 'Dumb & Dumber' but with Jim Carrey playing off himself (his other personality) rather than Jeff Daniels, and fans of the Golden Globe winning actor are likely to enjoy him strutting his stuff here. For the general film-goer though, this is a movie to approach with some caution. The film throws around some interesting ideas regarding assertiveness and expressing one's feelings, but with an overload of exposition and such childish gags like uncontrolled urination and a chicken stuck where the sun does not shine, this is very much a mixed bag of a movie. The antagonists in the tale are not particularly menacing or memorable either, though as usual, the Farrellys get several memorable turns from the rest of their supporting cast. Michael Bowman shines in particular as a social misfit albino man who befriends Carrey. In a unique and interesting touch, the end credits also include stills of all bit players in the cast with arrows to identifying actors they are.","Me, Myself & Irene"
32,Floated2,Entertaining at moments but not all that great,6,3 September 2010,"There are several little details here that inspire a series of awkward plot interventions, the only funny ones being the circumstances in which Hank and Charlie get into physical arguments regarding their love for Irene, at one point showcasing how Carrey throwing punches at himself can drag him away from the wheel of a moving car. Some elements generate stereotypes, such as the perception of African Americans being the only characters allowed in the movie to slur extreme vulgarities, and most others involve the typical traits of any recent major comedy: penis jokes, breast jokes, urine jokes, and even dildo jokes.Laughs are not the only missing link here, however. Though a premise is firmly grounded, the story meanders on and on, giving the writers more of an excuse to unleash even a few more painfully unfunny wisecracks. Likewise, the characters treat each other like illegitimate relatives at family reunions, not to any purpose of establishing their characteristics, but just to serve as a hammer that will force Charlie to crack. The movie just wasn't that funny. It was somewhat entertaining and interesting to watch but really wasn't that good. ==================================================================== ====== As a rewatch 05.03.17', this film is more so quite crude and offensive but that was entirely the point. The jokes aimed in this film were meant to be as offensive and some may it funny while others not as much, while it is for shock value. It is entertaining but the plot isn't too interesting, though the film is definitely carried by Jim Carrey's performance which makes a film like this passable and interesting enough to keep watching. Although it isn't that great but there is something there. Rating changed from 4 to 6/10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
33,Anonymous_Maxine,"This is definitely the slapstick comedy that it was made out to be, but Jim Carrey, the master of modern slapstick comedy, makes it work.",7,14 March 2001,"I had high hopes for Me, Myself, and Irene, but mostly because I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Clearly, the story of the film did not strike me as something truly ingenious, but it provided huge possibilities for Carrey to work his hilarious magic. While not nearly as good as some of his comedy classics, such as Dumb & Dumber, Me, Myself and Irene was very successful on many levels. (spoilers) One of the things that is seen here (as is seen in many of Carrey's films) is the criminal subplot that actually drives much of the comedy. In some cases, this provides for some irony that is actually pretty funny, but also makes you wonder about the message that is being delivered to this film's target audience (`somewhere along the line they get the idea that the cops are the bad guys-` BAM!). Well, in this case, the cops really ARE the bad guys. While the majority of the film was very successful as a comedy, I think that some things may have been a little bit blown out of proportion, or a little too childish. The cow, for example, which was `lucky to be alive' after Carrey shot it in the head six times and then tried to wrestle to death, was just too much. On the other hand, this kind of excess is not too unexpected, given the film's directors. Also, Carrey's three vulgar but hugely intelligent sons may have gone a little too far, but in this case, it was still really funny. They also ended the film in a charming way  `Thanks for watching our motherf**kin' movie!' I can't say that I loved Me, Myself, and Irene, but it was still a good comedy. Renee Zellweger gave a good performance as the object of the affection of both of Carrey's personalities in the film. And she also delivered a good kick to his jaw in one particularly amusing scene. The reason to watch this film is for the hilarious performance by Carrey as the two strikingly different colliding personalities, Hank and Charlie. The breathy sound of Hank's voice gets a little tiring pretty quick, but this doesn't take away from the laughs that are skillfully delivered.","Me, Myself & Irene"
34,videorama-759-859391,"Split personalities, not all that funny",6,21 January 2014,"Carrey has reunited with the Farrely brothers in a film, with a more misfire of laughs than successful ones, though still it's adequately funny, the setting of story, that being in Rhode Island, is interesting. Carrey plays a Rhode Island state trooper who has been the butt of a lot of people, that walk all over him. A yes man. Finally cracking up in a supermarket, while waiting at a counter, he creates a new, ""take no s..t"" character Hank, the absolute opposite of his character, Charlie Bailey. In split personality, this is what can happen, a person is so revolted by his own self, he replaces it with someone totally different. Renee Zewellger, as an EPA employee, who we kind of get the feeling, she would rather be somewhere else, plays an ex girlfriend of a guy involved in corrupt dealings with the company, where she's caught and transported by Carrey on police motorcycle to a safer place, pursued by the bad guys, that involve other corrupt agents etc. The movie does play well as an adventure though, and Carrey's three black blasphemous sons (there's a story there) are a hoot, probably the funniest thing in the movie. Too, near the end in a fight to the death between Carrey and Zewellger's ex, we have an ugly bit of violence, unwarranted, only if in another attempt to humour, when Carrey's thumb is blown off. The theme song was another good thing about this average humorous movie that still plays in my head and takes me to 2001. Farrely fans should still see this, with laughs, far and few between. Carrey does make a goose of himself and overacts in this though, where the every changing back of personalities in scenes, is something you just don't buy.","Me, Myself & Irene"

He's a victim, of that, there is no doubt. But a hero? No, I just couldn't get there.It has some laughs, though they are tepid, and the slapstick is classic Carrey, but the material is too sad to let the laughs permeate and you're left feeling conflicted about what enjoyment you DID manage.I liked it and I like Carrey, but this will not make it to my collection.It's a tepid 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.","Me, Myself & Irene"
37,dfranzen70,Mental rental,6,20 January 2001,"Me, Myself & Irene is one of those typically wacky comedies with mistaken identities and mental illness played off for laughs. Except the laughs are about as frequent as they would be for an actual mental patient - in other words, mental illness comedy ain't funny, it's forced.
Jim Carrey plays Charlie, a Rhode Island state trooper who is cycling to upstate New York with a prisoner in tow - Irene (Rene Zellwegger), who has been accused of a hit-and-run crime in New York. Charlie seems like a nice guy, except Irene notices he takes pills. Why, she asks? Because, Charlie explains, if he doesn't take one every six hours he feels..... funny. Something about paranoid schizophrenia. Irene gives that old nod-and-smile reaction we've all given to someone before.There are two plots at work here. One is the someone-framed-Irene-and-we-know-who-but-the-good-guys-won't-until-the-end-of-the-movie plot, and the other is the one that tries to set the movie apart. Charlie's schizophrenia, you see, has manifested itself in the guise of Hank, a tough-talking, insensitive, loutish bully who is everything Charlie is not. Naturally, while Irene is in Charlie's custody, Hank comes out at certain times, and hilarity ensues. (Charlie also has three African American kids! His ex-wife ran off with a short-statured African American limo driver - coincidence? - and the three kids, now in high school, feature prominently in this film.)But for me, hilarity does NOT ensue. I found most of the jokes to be forced, even cloying. I found that I pitied Charlie more than I laughed with him. I found his romance of Irene (and don't forget, Zellwegger was his beau at the time) to be a little trite. To me, they didn't quite have the necessary chemistry. Yes, there were a few funny moments in the movie - and the kids were funny at times. I found this movie to be wildly uneven, funny in spots, dull in many others. I don't think Carrey's made a good film in a little while now, and I hope he can turn it around soon before he becomes the new Chevy Chase.","Me, Myself & Irene"
38,meeza,Split Decision!,7,28 March 2001,"Thank you very much for taking the time to read my film review on ` Me, Myself and Irene' starring that sweet funnyman Jim Carrey. This film is about a police officer with a split personality who is infatuated with the woman he has to escort on assignment.  Jim Carrey was just terrific and so were the black actors who played his sons. Please see it! I promise I won't lie to you. Oh no!!!! What is happening?????? Hey losers! I guess your lives must be so boring that you do not have anything else to do in your life but to read these film reviews. Maybe since your lives are so empty, you could go see `Me, Myself & Irene' with you, yourself, and I- which are probably the only friends you got.  Anyway, there were one too many scenes in this film that were of the same old slapstick variety. As you see, I give a split vote to `Me, Myself & Irene.' ***Average","Me, Myself & Irene"
39,Chris_Docker,Walk out bored or howl with laughter - an inventive piece,6,8 October 2000,"Given the audience reaction, this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie (about ten people walked out, the rest, including me, howled and shrieked with laughter). Jim Carrey plays a State Trooper with multiple personality disorder. His one personality is a rough, aggressive person, releasing the pent-up feelings of the other personality, a kind, lovable door-mat character. Both of them fall in love with Irene, forming a love-triangle with only two people. The real treat of this movie is Jim Carrey, without whom it would be a fairly limp effort. Not Carrey as the comedian from his early movies, but an incredibly inventive performer - for the second half of the film most of the audience are riveted just to see what he will do next.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Charlie/Hank (Jim Carrey) was a really funny guy in my opinion. He was especially funny when he was goofing off. I thought that Irene (Renée Zellweger) was a very beautiful woman. The two characters I couldn't stand were Dickie (Daniel Greene) and Lieutenant Gerke (Chris Cooper). This was because they were pure a*******! One thing that surprised me was that Chris Cooper from A TIME TO KILL was in this movie. In conclusion, I highly recommend this gut-busting, in-your-face, laugh-out-loud comedy to all you Jim Carrey or Renée Zellweger fans who have not seen it.","Me, Myself & Irene"
41,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Gloriously unapologetic,8,15 August 2016,"Probably the most ridiculous outing the Farrelly brothers have ever taken us on, Me Myself & Irene cares not a whiff who it offends, how many eyes are rolled or how badly the scales of humour are tipped, or rather yanked, in the direction of extremely bad taste. With the exception of Stuck On You where they played it safe, every dirty little flick in their career is a testament to the utmost raunch in film, the very definition of lowbrow humour and never not flat out totally hilarious. Obesity, dates gone wrong, Amish people, conjoined twins, bowling, physical disability, they've tackled every scatological venture you could dream up. This time it's mental illness, in a completely unapologetic depiction that will leave most people red faced, either from fuming or laughing their a&@es off. Jim Carrey plays Charlie, a meek little puss who spends one day with his newlywed bride, before she's whisked away by a black midget played by Tony Cox, who gets all the black midget roles, that little bast$&rd. Charlie has a knack for never standing up for himself, and letting anyone walk all over him. He's a Rhode Island State Trooper with no balls to back up his badge, and is pretty much the laughingstock of the town. All this bottles up and reaches a boiling point, resulting in a classic Carrey meltdown of rubbery expressions and spastic guttural incantations. Emerging from the mess is Hank, Charlie's abrasive, dysfunctional and borderline psychotic alter ego, a result of what the film imagines multiple personality disorder just must be like. Hank causes all hell, and the first time he shows up is the funniest bit in the film, an extended montage of hair raising antics that oddly seems to sum up the Farrely's career. Charlie/Hank then get caught up in some intrigue involving beautiful Renee Zellweger, back when she was still Renee Zelweger. The scattershot story is just a playground for Carrey though, and this is some of the edgiest R rated mayhem he's ever caused, guaranteed to arch the backs of some of the more, shall we say... *sensitive* folks we have to deal with running around these days. Charlie has three loudmouth black sons that were dumped in his lap, and they've now grown into profane geniuses who love their pops to bits, and it's here the film finds its only bit of heart amidst the crass vulgarity. The baddies are the classic slimy Farrely cretins, a dirty cop played by Chris Cooper, and an unsavory golf club owner (Daniel Greene). Robert Forster makes a welcome appearance as Charlie's Trooper boss, and keep a look out for Anthony Anderson, Cam 'Sea Bass' Neely, Richard Tyson, Lenny Clarke, and the always hilarious Richard Jenkins. Like I said, this is likely the lowest rung of the ladder in everyone's career, but it's a splendidly offensive, colorfully trashy piece of gross out bliss, and definitely the dirtiest of the Carrely team ups. Where else can you see Jim stare a five your old kid down and growl ""What are you staring at, f$&ker?""","Me, Myself & Irene"
42,aidanratesmovies,Painfully Unfunny,4,16 May 2020,"It has a few amusing moments, but Me, Myself and Irene is hardly capable of keeping up with itself, let alone for an entire 2 hours. The film suffers from an incredibly lazy and forced script, of which can be quite predictable, and quite annoying to watch unfold. The film tries very hard to earn its laugh, with it succeeding at doing so very rarely. The acting in total is not too bad, with Jim Carrey truly giving his all into his performance (although his character can be a bit annoying at times), and Renee Zellweger providing a fine part in her role as the love interest. The film is not very well paced, and is incredibly long for almost no reason. It could be at least a half and hour shorter, and many elements of the film seem incredibly pointless. It has its amusing moments, and can spark a giggle or two with its over-the-top antics, but in the end, Me, Myself and Irene is a forgettable wannabe comedy from the Farrelly brothers, that tries too hard to make you laugh, and never delivers quite the right amount.

43,AudioFileZ,"Very funny...But, there will be those who find it too crude.",8,7 March 2008,"This movie really is so much better because of Jim Carey. He's certainly not the sole reason that it is so hilarious, I don't think it's possible to remember all the scenes that doubled me over with laughter but it's hard to imagine it being so ""over-the-top"" funny without him. It is just about the perfect comedic vehicle for the multi-talented rubber faced actor.This movie skewers so many things about all of us that you need to watch it twice, or more, to get all the jokes and references as they come fast and continuously. The Farrelly Brothers know how write because it could be sophomoric crude without so many elements coming together. As usual, their selection of music is impeccable too.This is a very funny movie that begs to be watched with friends so be sure and put this on the ""gang's shortlist"" and enjoy. If crude humor makes you uncomfortable this movie is a must to avoid, but, if, however, you have no hangups regarding the sophistication, or lack thereof, of your comedy then there are not many better comedies you could ""waste"" two hours on.

44,Samiam3,"Mediocre, but has its moments (not enough though)",5,25 April 2010,"The idea is priceless, a sort of anti-psycho. What could be worse than a split personality cop, well perhaps a movie that does such a fellow injustice would qualify. Me, Myself and Irene is not terrible, but I don't recommend it. The quality of Carry's performance is inconsistent, half the jokes are not funny and Renée Zelwegger is useless, as she is in almost everything (Cold Mountain aside).Jim Carrey as a Rhode Island State Trooper is in for the ride of his life, when he becomes escort to a lady who is being chased by the mob and some crooked feds. Is Carrey's split personality gonna save them or get them in trouble.It is not until the climax when Carrey really shows his colors. Up till then, we have to put up with him bouncing back and forth between half geek, half e jerk, and he isn't much good at either until he becomes both at the same time, and starts fighting with himself. If Renee Zellweger was funnier it may have also taken a little out of the tedium of a fairly dull first hour. There is a nice sub-plot gag of Carrey's three adopted black sons, trying to find their dad on the run, during which they have to (among other things) pilot a chopper using the manual which is in German. Perhaps it's just a matter of taste, but Me, Myself, and Irene despite its moments feels insufficient.","Me, Myself & Irene"
45,Seraphion,Funny but very predictable and flawed,6,10 October 2015,"The story gets very much predictable as soon as you read the title and sees Jim Carey at the cast list. It will all be about a split personality on a man. The movie did well enough in taking its time to build on the background story of how Charlie unknowingly created Hank. But that's just about it. Besides Jim Carey's awesome performance, there's little more that this movie has to offer. Renee Zellweger did just enough for her parts. The story gets flawed as many of the scenes didn't have adequate transition and instead edited poorly that scene cuts feel strange. Chris Cooper and Richard Jenkins also didn't create believable characters since their screen time is often too brief.","Me, Myself & Irene"

However Charlie bares the brunt of the consequences as a result of Hanks behaviour. However, one day he meets a young woman named Irene whose ex-boyfriend is framing her for embezzlement, tax evasion & multiple other crimes so is to protect his identity. Irene then goes on the run with Charlie after a near miss with an assassin attack. What follows is Charlie repeatedly turning into Hank as the 2 go on the run while 2 corrupt officers & the FBI try to find them.The film is ace! Really funny! Lots of crude, rude raw Un-PC (Thanks Christ) humour to satisfy! Now, while the story-line is a bit so-so & a little out of place it isn't bad & somewhat easy to follow, the scenes of Hank are hilarious & ace! The supermarket scene especially is great!It's a shame that films like this don't get made as often or even at all anymore. Knowing the PC butt-hurt generation we live in now where lefty people & snowflakes take offence to everything this film would get pelted with hate now. Films now are either preachy or simply just generic & humourless. The Un-PC humour in this film is just what makes it great.Overall a great comedy of the 00's! 9/10","Me, Myself & Irene"

49,baumer,A funny failure,6,25 June 2000,"Me Myself and Irene is a film that is hilarious when it is funny, silly when it is not and quite unfunny in most other places.  It is the kind of film that uses the same site gags over and over again and hopes that you laugh eventually at them.  Eventually the jokes get tired and even some of the performances get weak and soggy after a while.The Farrely brothers, as we all know, are the genius' behind Something About Mary.  That film worked because it was non stop hilarity.  It invented new jokes, gross out humour and it basically took us in a direction that we had never been before when it came to comedy.  MM&I tries to do the same and for the most part it doesn't succeed.  That is not to say the film isn't funny, it's just to say that it isn't funny as much as I thought it might be. There are some funny bits involving sexual aids, bathroom humour, and a cow, but where as those come so few and far between, the rest is lame, especially the split personality stuff.  The jokes get old and there is only so much that the Farrely's give Carey to work with.Now the funniest parts of the film, in my humble opinion, are the scenes with his sons.  When hank was married, his wife gave birth to three black twins.  She ends up running off with a black midget that is a member of MENSA, so you figure out if Hank is the real dad or not.  But anyway, these three guys love to watch Richard Pryor, use the MF word the way Pryor or Eddie Murphy would, are smarter than most NASA scientists and love their dad unconditionally.  Now I'm not sure who plays two of the three ""twins"" but the funniest of the bunch is played by Anthony Anderson.  Anderson has just recently popped up in three movies, including this one.  And in all three, he was hilarious, even when the movie was supposed to be serious.  His appearances in Romeo Must Die, Big Momma's House and now MM&I should solidify him as one of the rising stars of comedy.  I will bet that in two or three years he will have his first starring role.  But until that time he always seems to be a bright spot in whatever film he is in, this one is no exception.  Along with his two brothers, he is a scene stealer in every way. I enjoyed watching him in here and the film was better when he and his two brothers were in it than when they weren't, and that is quite the praise considering who they are starring with.Me Myself and Irene isn't a great film but it is not a terrible one either. You could do worse so far this summer and you could do better.  At least the Farelly's try to make this funny in every scene, and that is more than you can say for many film makers.  I guess my disappointment with it is that to me, summer is a time for the great films to come out during the year, not the Oscar caliber films, but the ones that entertain you.  So far this summer is one of the worst for anticipated films.  This was one of the films that I was really looking forward to seeing and it, just like most of the others thus far, is just okay.  The only real good film so far is GLADIATOR. The rest have been pretty bad or just so so.  Me Myself and Irene is no exception.It does have some sporadic scenes of hilarity and when you leave the theater, you at least leave after seeing one of the funniest bits in the film.As Anderson and his two brothers are flying a plane, they wave to us, the audience, and say with huge, teethy grins, "" Thanks for watching our m****f***** movie. ""6 out of 10****  Just a quick side note in defense of the films theme and its ""apparent"" lack of honesty in terms of portraying schitzo's in a positive way.So what!!!Films like this are not meant to be taken seriously.  They are a funny take on a situation and nothing more.  It is not a film makers job to have everything portrayed honestly, especially when it comes to comedy.  I don't think the Farelly's believe or are trying to say that this is how all schitzos are.  To get p***ed off about something as trivial as this is just plain ignorant.  Those people are probably the same people that got ticked at DOGMA for dissing Christianity.  My advice to all those people is simple. Get a life people.  This is Hollywood, not the New England journal of medicine.","Me, Myself & Irene"

This film by comparison really struggles. A meaningless plot that only complicates matters, and makes the film 30 minutes too long. It can't seem to decide whether it's a Carrey film or a Farrelly Brothers film. Only the morning urination scene is on a par with ""There's Something About Mary"".","Me, Myself & Irene"
53,Beta_Gallinger,A comedy from the controversial Farrelly Brothers which quickly wears out its welcome,4,30 December 2010,"I've known of this movie for several years now, recognizing the star, famous comedian Jim Carrey, and also knowing it was a Farrelly Brothers comedy. Earlier this year, I finally watched ""There's Something About Mary"", after knowing about it since probably around the time it came out over a decade earlier (when I was a little too young to see it). I was expecting that to be a really funny film, due to its reputation and the fact that ""Dumb & Dumber"" has made me laugh more than once, but I was SORELY mistaken! I then watched ""Kingpin"" and ""Shallow Hal"", both of which I hadn't seen in years, and I found them both to be mixed blessings this time. Before watching ""Me, Myself & Irene"" very close to the New Year, I figured it could be anywhere from pretty good to fairly lame, and it basically turned out to be the latter for me.Charlie Baileygates is a Rhode Island state trooper who is constantly taken advantage of. As a young man, he marries a woman named Layla after she promises to stay with him no matter what, but then she has an affair behind his back with a limo driver named Shonté, and soon gives birth to triplets. Charlie lives in denial of this affair and seems to think he is the biological father of these three boys, but eventually, Layla leaves with Shonté, leaving Charlie to raise the triplets on his own! They grow up in his household, and he gets a lot of respect from them, but not much respect from those outside the home. After years of taking abuse and keeping his anger inside, the trooper finally develops a nasty alter ego named Hank Evans! Charlie gets medication to stop his second personality and is sent on a trip to escort a woman named Irene Waters to Massena, New York, where she is to face charges for a hit and run which it is believed she committed, even though the culprit is actually her ex-boyfriend, Dickie Thurman. It turns out that hit men are after Irene, so she escapes with Charlie, who leaves his medicine behind and frequently turns into Hank on the adventure that ensues! Jim Carrey did sometimes amuse me here, which is more than I can say about his performance as Dr. Edward Nygma/the Riddler in ""Batman Forever"", but the smiles/laughs were still very sporadic. Shonté accusing Charlie of attacking his race and dwarfism and getting violent over it isn't funny, and at this point, it already looks like ""Me, Myself & Irene"" was going to be a lame comedy. Unfortunately, that scene doesn't lie. The scenes showing Charlie and the triplets watching Richard Pryor and Chris Rock can be pretty funny, but those are just two segments. The film continues to be unfunny as we watch Charlie take abuse from people around him, but it also isn't that funny when the character turns into Hank and starts fighting back, and doing things such as sucking on a woman's teat on his first rampage! The dullness in this Farrelly Brothers comedy continues during Charlie/Hank and Irene's adventure on the road, with many people in pursuit of them. I did laugh at the part where the Whitey character claims he murdered his family, but there weren't too many other times when I laughed or even smiled while watching the chaotic road trip.I've watched a total of four Farrelly Brothers films in the past year. Two of these I had never seen before, which were ""There's Something About Mary"" and this 2000 release, and I thought both of them were pretty lame, even though I'm sure most people who have seen them would disagree with me, especially on the 1998 blockbuster. In between my viewings of those two comedies was when I most recently watched ""Kingpin"" and ""Shallow Hal"", and the former showed a significant improvement, since I had previously hated it, and the latter may have improved somewhat as well after my first viewing, but neither of these lived up to my two viewings of ""Dumb & Dumber"" in 2007. I saw a lot of that first Farrelly Brothers movie for the first time in 1999, but didn't see all of it until 2007. After seeing a handful of their films, it doesn't seem to me that they're among the most talented of those involved in crude, irreverent humour these days, though there are worse comedians of this type. While ""Me, Myself & Irene"" does have a following, I really don't expect to ever be part of it.","Me, Myself & Irene"
54,jhclues,What A Team: Carrey And The Farrelly Brothers!,8,5 July 2000,"The Farrelly Brothers strike again, with a movie that is alternately outrageous, gross, stupefying, visually eclectic, unpredictable and, most importantly, hilarious.  With `Me, Myself & Irene,' the same zany duo that brought us `There's Something About Mary,' have outdone themselves, and this time around they have Jim Carrey, again, to boot.  If ever there was a marriage made in cinematic comedic heaven, it's Carrey and the Farrelly brothers.  `Dumb and Dumber' (which also starred Carrey) was just a warm up for this one, though.  Here Carrey plays an eighteen year veteran of the Rhode Island highway Patrol, whose wife left him early in his career, not long after delivering triplets (all boys), the father of whom Charlie (Carrey) obviously is not.  Mild mannered, good guy Charlie never questions the lineage, however, and when the story picks up, the three are highly intelligent (their parents were both MENSA presidents), strapping (to say the least) boys, who share a loving relationship with their father.  Charlie is just too good for his own sake, though, and after years of suppressed anger and avoiding any kind of confrontation, the dam finally bursts. His psychological needs have created a split personality, and `Hank' emerges with a vengeance.  He quickly winds up in trouble and on medication, but it's only the beginning for him.  He's assigned to take a prisoner, Irene (Renee Zellweger), to upstate New York, where she is wanted on a bogus hit-and-run beef.  The real problem is, a former boyfriend thinks she's been privy to some shady dealings in which he's been involved, that have to do with his golf course (where she was greenskeeper), and the DEQ.  *SPOILER ALERT*  Soon Charlie and Irene are being pursued by a wrong cop (Chris Cooper) and a crooked DEQ agent (Richard Jenkins), and `Hank' takes over when Charlie just can't stand the heat.  And so begins the laugh filled adventures of Charlie, Hank and Irene. 	Jim Carrey really breaks loose in this one, in what amounts to a duel role. Charlie is such a nice guy, totally benign, who gets no respect on the job or from the people in town, but who is nevertheless a stand-up fellow and good father.  When Hank emerges, though, all bets are off; affecting a Clint Eastwood, `Dirty Harry' style vocal rasp and an intimidating demeanor, the least civic infraction or personal affront no longer goes unattended.  If there was ever any doubt about it, Carrey here proves that he is nothing less than a master of physical transformation; his initial change into Hank is awesome to behold, and as the story progresses he slips effortlessly between one character and the other, and his final confrontation (with himself) is a riot.  And he does it by dexterously taking it to the edge without going completely over the top into the ridiculous.  Zellweger gives a notable performance, as well; initially somewhat nondescript, she warms up as things move along, and ultimately her Irene emerges as a rather endearing character. It's a tough part, given the fact that she is competing, somewhat, in what is predominately a showpiece for Carrey, but she is just winsome enough to keep herself in the running throughout.  The supporting cast includes Robert Forster (the Lieutenant, Captain, Colonel) and Michael Bowman (Whitey). 	As with all of their movies, this offering from Peter and Bobby Farrelly is not going to be for everyone; it is politically incorrect and anything but subtle from beginning to end.  But it is funny, at times hysterical, and it's one of Carrey's best performances, one in which he aptly demonstrates just how versatile he really is.  There are some over-the-top, gross-out sight gags, definitely not for the squeamish, and some of the language is off-color.  If you're familiar with the Farrelly's previous work, you'll know what to expect; if not, just steel yourself and get ready for a wild ride.  No matter what your personal sensitivity level is, you're going to laugh at `Me, Myself & Irene,' even if it's in spite of yourself.  At the very least, you're going to find out what all the fuss is over Jim Carrey. One way or another, this is one movie you're not likely to forget, and the chances are pretty good that you're going to want to see it again.  I rate this 8/10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
55,educallejero,The Bipolar Jim Carrey on a bad day,1,23 August 2018,"I have to admit. I don't like Jim Carrey that much. Don't get me wrong, I can see the appeal, because I LOVED HIM in ""Liar Liar"", ""The Truman Show"", ""Dumb and Dumber"". I adore those movies and him in particular in them.
But then I just despise him in almost every movie that take these same traits he has in those (the silly faces, noises, extravangtly dumb egotistical characters) to an extreme that it hurts. The Ace Ventura's movies, The Mask, this movie, makes those traits the only star. Poorly writen, the joke is: JIM CARREY. That's not funny. Without any context or joke, just his dumb faces are that: dumb faces and noises.It doesn't help that his partner here is, buck for buck, the worst actress of all time: Renée Zellweger.By the way, I would criticize the directors, but I liked the direction and cinematography just fine (its a dumb comedy anyways). Oh wait, they also wrote this movie, so shame on you Bobby Farrelly and shame on you too Peter Farrelly.","Me, Myself & Irene"
56,CharltonBoy,Another Farrelly Brothers hilarious comedy.h,8,21 April 2002,"First there was Something About Mary then there was this and didnt think they could improve on the first movie but they have. Jim Carey is outstanding as a skizophrenic cop who has a good side and bad side . I thought carey was somewhat predictable in some movies except for the brilliant Cable Guy but in this he is at his very best. Forget the story because really it does not matter , the gags are the what make this a highly watchable very funny comedy. Some are a little near the knuckle but that is what makes the Farrelly Brother so good at what they do. Some of the stunts are superb as is the make up. You cant help but laugh your socks off.....Mother F*****r. 8 out of 10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
57,gbheron,Not in the Least Bit Funny,2,19 October 2002,"After ""The Truman Show"", I felt Jim Carrey had arrived as an A-List dramatic actor, offering much more depth than he'd previously exhibited with his physical style of slapstick comedy. He was now a true actor, capable of opening and carrying a major release. So then, why did he team up with the Farrelly brothers and make this piece of tripe? OK, smack me; he did it for a $20 million payday.But talk about bad choices, this has got to be one of the worst big-budget movies of 2000. Ok, it's a Farrelly brothers movie, so you know the humor will be on the far gross side of good taste. But in their earlier movies such as ""Kingpin"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", and especially ""There's Something About Mary"", the Farrellys cultivated a sense of humanity. The audience had a connectedness with the characters and their dilemmas, which helps make the jokes work. Not so, in ""Me, Myself and Irene"". It's like a crummy nightclub comic who tries to make his unfunny material funny by telling the same jokes over, and over, and over. I won't go into the plot, it's unimportant to my opinion of this movie. That is, that this movie is an unfunny, offensive waste of celluloid. I can think of no reason to recommend it to anybody.","Me, Myself & Irene"

60,stamper,Cool scenes and dumb a.. scenes,6,25 February 2001,"This movie is just one typical Farrelly comedy. Always on the edge of one can and cannot show to the audience. As a result of that some jokes are terribly lame (cow and chicken joke) whereas others are just plain hilarious (hotel joke). I really laughed my a.. off sometimes but I did not think this one was as good as There's Something about Mary. There were lots of reasons for that. First of all this was more lame (think Dumb and Dumber), second of all, some things were terribly predictable plus the acting was lame some times (not Carrey's, but Zellwegers) for instance in that cow scene. All in all not something I would recommend you to watch but neither something you must beware of. Oh yes Anna Kournikova is in this one too and she looks very good (better than on court). Too bad there is not more of her in the film.

61,Christian_Dimartino,"Occasionally disgusting, overall hilarious.",7,25 November 2010,"Peter and Bobby Farrelly have been directing films ever since the 90's. I have enjoyed all of their films. Some more than others. They have done some classics, such as Dumb and dumber and There's something about Mary. Me, myself, and Irene is a nasty movie, like There's something about Mary, but it's a funny one. Like almost all of their films.Charlie(played by Jim Carrey) is a Rhode island state trouper who is a pushover. His wife left him for a black midget and gave birth to three black kids. And left him with them. People in Rhode island don't respect him. Not even the police force. So one day, a switch goes off in his mind that gives him a second personality:Hank. Hank is not a pushover.Hank is a foul mouthed, bad tempered pervert. Charlie, and Hank, are offered to escort Irene(Renee Zellweger) to New York. Irene has had some trouble with some criminals. So Irene and Hank and Charlie go on a road trip. Irene and Charlie have to deal with the insanity of Hank, while getting hurt in the process.There are some really gross out gags here. Like when Hank sucks on a woman's breast and has a milk mustache. But yet there are some very funny and crude lines that come out of Carrey's mouth, such as""That's okay my little pussy fart"".I am a lifelong fan of Jim Carrey. So it won't surprise you that I am reccomending it. No it's not as good as the first time the Farrelly brothers worked with Jim Carrey, but I still thought this was a good movie. Though the plot is a bit ridiculous and some of the jokes are very nasty. See it still though.B","Me, Myself & Irene"
62,the red duchess,they got it wrong - its sublime.(possible spoilers),6,2 October 2000,"For some reason, 'me myself and irene' has been dismissed in America as puerile, uninventive, even offensive, when, of course, it is very nearly a masterpiece.  If it's not quite the work of genius that was 'there's something about mary', than that's probably because the narrative isn't tight enough, the quest isn't as emotionally interesting, the heroine isn't Cameron Diaz.  But the comedy is frequently inspired, Jim Carrey gives the kind of rich, thoughtful performance snobs can only see in his soi-disant 'serious' movies, and the film offers a vision of America as mythical and ambitious as 'Birth of a nation'.'irene' isn't offensive because the Farrellys' vision is inclusive. Charlie's schizophrenia is a fundamental rupture that afflicts the nation as a whole.   It is important that he is a policeman, a servant of that power that needs to be monolithic, recognisably whole for it to function, to exercise control.  Far from being this single force for good, the police are as full of corrupt, cold-blooded killers and destructive lunatics as it is naive law-enforcers.  This schizophrenia is mirrored in th land - over the opening credits, and throughout the film, we see Charlie passing over bridges or beside water, indicating a constant movement between two realms, two states of mind that are separate and need to be bridged.The Farrellys find that rupture is at the heart of the conservative ethos, and seek alternatives.  This again is figured in Charlie's schizophrenia. This is what a bunch of rednecks call his problem - we can recognise something else, the Jekyll and Hyde syndrome, whereby a facade of sociability struggles to conceal darker urges of sex, violence and power. charlie's transformation, in the supermarket, is an affectionate parody of Fredric March's change in Mamoulian's classic film of the Stevenson fable. Just as this film's duality focuses on a figure representing authority, and thereby destabilising that authority, so Stevenson's anti-hero, the very epitome of mental unhealth, was a doctor - Hank's Hyde does what Charlie's Jekyll would never dare to do (the rub is that Hank is as hilariously inept as Charlie).But, though the film seems to be working itself towards some kind of 'cure', a way to make Charlie whole again, it brilliantly doesn't: Charlie's schizophrenia is accepted for what it is; he is no longer demonised by difference, but welcomed back into a social fold, crowned by intimations of marriage.  Of course, the Farrellys don't let us forget what happened after the last marriage.This resolution culminates the film's strategy - the presentation of difference as difference, and yet its ultimate acceptance into the group without the difference being diluted.  So much so that this group (of schizophrenics, albinos, ditzes, overweight geniuses etc.) provides a breakaway alternative to the dominant group (police, big business), with the latter being the disruptive outsider, through individualism, greed and criminality..  Only the intellectually myopic (hell, you're welcome too!) could fail to see that 'Irene' is textbook PC wish-fulfilment.What rescues this cuddly vision is the wonderfully scattershot comedy. Unlike 'mary', the ratio of good gags to not so good isn't quite that high, but when it is good, it's fantastic and genuinely intelligent - there is a Surrealist desire to surprise and make you rethink that can be found in the editing, the tone of various scenes, in the way a joke develops unexpectedly, in the reactions of character, that is simply beyond the reach of the kind of films routinely acclaimed as superior.  Of course, the jokes hit on recurrent male fears, about female sexuality, its links to the bestial, homosexuality etc., but this is an internet age where boys don't even need the social act of top-shelf shopping anymore, where male emotional maturity is in terminal regression.  My favourite bit comes early on, with Charlie's troubles with a chauffeur.","Me, Myself & Irene"
63,FlickJunkie-2,A backward step for Jim Carrey,4,25 February 2001,"Sometimes, when a film like this becomes a blockbuster, it makes me despondent about the state of our society.  This is the very lowest form of comedy.  It is coarse, ribald and vulgar, a barrage of tasteless humor that runs the gamut from disgusting to offensive.  The Farrelly brothers burst onto the scene with `Dumb and Dumber', another ridiculous film with shallow humor that the masses ate like candy.  They began to show some promise with `There's Something About Mary', but then they decided we haven't been insulted enough lately and they produced this tripe.Jim Carrey is a brilliantly talented comedian.  After `The Truman Show' and `Man on the Moon', it seemed like he was progressing as a comedian beyond excrement humor.  I'm sure this film made him a truckload of money, but it is a relapse into fatuousness and a step backward in his career.There are plenty of funny scenes in this film.  Carrey is a funny guy. However, there is also a passel of gross-out and gutter humor, which can only be targeted at pubescent or moronic individuals.  The film takes insulting pot shots at blacks, women, and the disabled, and seems to revel in its own poor taste.  It is normally easy to get a laugh out of me, and I appreciate slapstick more than most, but the trend toward repugnant humor exhibited in films like this and `Scary Movie' is disheartening.  What is more disturbing is how successful they are.I rated this film a 4/10.  I don't need to trash it because it trashes itself.  Carrey gives us a great deal of terrific physical comedy, but the material is mostly garbage.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Lots of good laughs, some very good. You'll find yourself at least entertained even if you don't like Carrey particularly because this film contains so many gags, it's got a lot in its repertoire. The film is constant comedic material, it just lever lets out. It's, just like Dumb and Dumber but not as great as Dumb and Dumber, a movie entirely created for the purpose of making people laugh. This is what you would call: a pure comedy. Yes there is a romantic element in the plot but it's only a part of the ride and helps contribute to the laughter. This film is full to burst with various wacky characters, scenes, jokes, just a bunch of different angles to hit the viewer with. It's certainly at least a very fun ride, and if you're looking for something purely entertaining that's silly, GO FOR IT. Oh and Zellweger looks SMOKING in this one.","Me, Myself & Irene"
68,policy134,Carrey's retread of his Stanley Ipkiss character with an R rating,4,14 August 2005,"Travelling with a schizophrenic motorcycle cop doesn't sound like a good time but this film doesn't seem to care. Of course, the Farrelly brothers are known for their peculiarities but making a film about a man with a psychological disorder is doomed from the start. Not that disorders should always be taken seriously, but to give Jim Carrey the disease is like saying: ""We give you a green card to be as outrageous as you wanna be"".Another problem is that Renee Zellweger, the Irene of the title has absolutely zero chemistry with Carrey. It's amazing to think that they became a couple shortly after because she is so unappealing in every scene she's in. Yes, she is kind of cute but she seems to be struggling with her lines and doesn't have the stamina for this kind of basically male-oriented territory.The non-actor who plays Whitey does well and Carrey's three sons also have their moments. The best part is the prologue describing how Carrey became what he is and the gag with his wife's t-shirts is priceless. The villains are cardboard and it's strange to see Chris Cooper as a total slimeball who pretends to be one of the good guys. The film does deserve an ""A"" for effort because I think it is better than ""There's something about Mary"" which got way too serious at the end.When will Carrey make a totally laugh riot like ""The Mask"" again. Maybe we will never know because he is fast becoming the man who never went further than talking out of his butt.","Me, Myself & Irene"

There is no consistency whatsoever and you quickly get bored watching this muddled, interminable and totally uninteresting script, from where a particularly strange atmosphere comes out.The gags aren't that funny overall, of course a few ones are rather good and may crack you a smile, but they are too sporadic and lost in this almost 2 hour feature.","Me, Myself & Irene"

72,chrisbrown6453,"Me, Myself & Irene challenges viewers with the troublesome politics of its comedy.",6,11 July 2001,"Me, Myself & Irene, pushes its comedy in the direction of parody. Populated by a series of extreme characters and a two-faced main character who either tolerates or openly mocks people.Charlie (Jim Carrey) is the laughingstock of the town. An extremely naive and insecure man, Charlie is constantly cheated, used and disrespected, in spite of the Rhode Island state police uniform he wears. Also feeling somewhat of an outsider inside his own home and around his three adopted sons (played by the amusing Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon and Mongo Brownlee), Charlie becomes the victim of his own anguish. Suddenly developing schizophrenia, his personality is split between Charlie and Hank, an extremely confrontational egomaniac who may only be appeased with medication. Charlie is challenged when he must follow a request to escort the attractive Irene (Renée Zellweger) to another city and evade corrupt police chief Joe (Chris Cooper) while the irrepressible Hank gains a life of his own. His condition is aggravated when feelings of love and desire enter the scene.Me, Myself & Irene clearly relies on Carrey's physical comedy and on his portrayals of the extremely passive and victimized Charlie and the rambunctious, vulgar and sexually driven Hank. An excess number of scenes which serve to exemplify Charlie's lack of authority and Hank's disregard for authority prove the film's concern with creating a series of laughable tableaux over a well-constructed plot. Me, Myself & Irene pushes its ""politically incorrect"" agenda by defining its targeted characters --a hotheaded dwarf, a timid albino, Charlie's overweight black sons, tortured animals, and a moronic-sounding narrator-- as laughable representations. Consequently, Me, Myself & Irene exemplifies a degradation of comedy, where the excitability caused by such issues as racial prejudice, disease, animal cruelty, and masturbation is exploited for the sake of provoking the viewer. In spite of those rare moments when the film does manage to create some comic relief without aggression, as in those scenes which expose the common sense of Charlie's genius sons, Me, Myself & Irene suffers its own identity crisis, as it lacks purpose, restraint and overall self-respect.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Sure it's crude, sure it's vulgar and juvenile at times, but sometimes we just have to take ourselves back to when we were younger and used to laugh at things that we would otherwise find rather disgusting.  The main treat is to watch Carrey transform from the sweet natured Charlie to the vulgar, Dirty Harry sounding Hank.  Hank does things that not many people would even dream of, and it's a kick to see him get away with some of them.  Equally funny are Charlie's three sons, who are highly intelligent, love their dad and use a certain phrase to great effect.  Some may find this movie offensive and occasionally funny at times, but I found it enjoyable from beginning to end.   A good way to blow off steam from a bad day.","Me, Myself & Irene"

75,djfrost-46786,Really??!!,4,4 May 2018,"I've come to realize Jim is not funny. Well in this movie for sure. The plot, come on. Jim is the same in The Mask. Two personalitys. What's funny are his 3 boys.","Me, Myself & Irene"

77,EthanBJones_03,Very funny movie and arguably one of Carrey's better performances,8,19 August 2016,"Overall: Honestly this is up there with some of Jim Carrey's better performances and a must but for me on Blu Ray. Some will not enjoy this movie due to it's humor and the fact that its main point of humor is Split Personality disorder which may offend some people. Nevertheless, I think this is a great movie and would highly recommend it.Good: Hilarious and entertaining from the offset and throughout. Each character is likable and unlikable when they need to be to help the plot progress and change the viewers feelings towards them. The acting is superb for all the characters as is the overall cinematography .Bad: The overall villain is not that interesting and quite weak to be honest. He didn't really have much, if any, purpose other than to score a pretty forgettable climax. The actual plot is never properly cleared up or actually explained but his is probably glossed over because who really watches a comedy movie for the though provoking and moving story. The music isn't the best and feels quite lazy at some points.Best Part: The fight scene between Jim Carrey and.... himself! 8/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
78,backup-50362,Feels like forever since a movie's made me laugh this hard,9,7 December 2020,"We'll never have movies like this again. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but when the script is hilarious and makes great use of his skills - it works. The rest of the cast is also superb. I don't think I've seen Anthony Anderson in anything bad. From dramas like Hustle n Flow, to comedies like Scary Movie - you know it's gonna be something good if he's in it.So yeah. A fun, pure black comedy, the kind of which we'll never see nowadays, so 20 years later seeing it for the first time - I appreciate it even more. Interesting how IMDb manipulates garbage modern SJW Netflix shows' ratings to be well over 7.5 despite mass 1-star reviews, but this great fun movie has a fairly low score somehow, despite the many positive reviews.","Me, Myself & Irene"
79,timothygartin,Disappointingly Stupid,5,15 November 2019,"The actors in this movie are very talented. This movie I think was supposed to be a farce where the situation is intentionally ridiculous, but it is written too seriously to be a farce and too ridiculous to be funny.It is just stupid at points and hard to watch. All scenes with the wife are terrible. The scene with the cow is terrible. I couldn't buy into any of the characters or understand why they were the way they were.I think this movie wasted its premise.","Me, Myself & Irene"
80,smakawhat,This film SUCKS!,2,20 January 2001,"Ok this film sucked.  I BARELY got any laughs out of this film at all, and it was tiring.  I did like Rene Zel.. whashername?  She's got good screen charisma and she even manages to come through this film unscathed considering its crappiness (I think she was in Jerry Macguire). The black guys had some moments, but it got anoying after m***a f***a this and m***a f***a that..Also the obligatory love romance which of course only exists because it has to, making things too sappy and dumb.  I think the thing the most is that Carrey's 'SHTICK' is getting old..Rating 2.5 out of 10","Me, Myself & Irene"
81,ExpendableMan,I laughed my arse off,9,1 February 2007,"Glancing over some of the other reviews of Me, Myself and Irene that crop up on this page, it seems loads of people absolutely hate this movie. If anything, the majority of negative comments appear to be coming from people quick to dismiss it as a dumb piece of un-PC gross out comedy, which is completely missing the point. This is a Farrelly Brothers film with Jim Carrey in the lead role, what were they expecting? Citizen Kane redux? I myself have a masters degree in Film Studies and while I like to sit around, stroking my beard (or failing that, somebody else's), watching Almodovar films and saying ""fascinating"" at regularly timed intervals, I also like to laugh. And Me, Myself and Irene is one of the most gut bustingly funny films I've watched in months.The story concentrates on a Rhode Island police officer named Charlie Bailey-Gates (Carrey), a downtrodden member of the community who everyone else in the town regularly takes advantage of and who hasn't been the same since his wife left him for a midget limo driver. One day though things get a bit too much and Charlie snaps, goes mad and ends up driving a car into the front window of the town barber shop and defecating on his neighbour's lawn. One trip to therapy later and it transpires that all his bottled up rage has manifested itself as a split personality called Hank and he has to keep taking pills to keep him sedated. Shortly after this happens, he meets a down on her luck woman called Irene (Renee Zellweger) who is in serious trouble with the law and events conspire to send the duo on a wild cross country journey to clear their names of murder.To say this lends itself to some painfully low brow humour would be an understatement and whether or not you will enjoy the movie rests largely on what your reaction to the phrase ""Jim Carrey being hit with nun-chucks by an angry black midget"" is. For those of you who prefer his more gentle approach in The Truman Show or Man on the Moon then this is not the film for you. If however, you howled with laughter watching Dumb & Dumber as I did, then this should be right up your street. Carrey, fresh off playing more restrained roles in the previously mentioned films looks to be having a total riot letting himself loose and his rubbery faced contortions are hilarious. Watching him wrestling with a cow, beating himself up and getting drop kicked down a hill is an absolute blast, the man is king of physical comedy. Throw in some very, very funny scenarios involving rubber dildos, albino waiters who may secretly be serial murderers and tarantulas and you have a highly entertaining turn.Its not all about Carrey though and some of the best moments come from his three sons. Charlie it seems was too happy to be married to be concerned when his wife gave birth to three black triplets and ended up raising the boys as his own, so when the storyline properly kicks off he has a trio of bickering homeboys for kids who all happen to be geniuses. The dialogue between the three provides some of the highlights of the film, especially during the scene where the boys steal a police helicopter. It also leads to the immortal line ""no bitches after eleven."" So before you all start complaining about this being crude, offensive, low brow trash and how we should all be watching Aguirre: Wrath of God or The Seventh Seal to really get the best out of cinema, consider this: not all movies have to be po-faced musings on the fates of man. Sometimes, all you really want is crude, offensive, low brow trash and this one was so hilarious, I had to stop the DVD three times because I was laughing so much I kept missing half the jokes.","Me, Myself & Irene"
82,SafReviews,Mediocre comedy movie,5,4 June 2021,"This movie has one of those typical comedy movies plots which are that not good and this makes the movie unintriguing and less funny. There were a few funny moments in the movie, however some of them were a bit too cheesy and cringeworthy for me which I kind of expected as I find some of Jim Carrey's comedy cringeworthy. The movie wasn't terrible and some of the characters are likeable, but the plot was too cheesy for me.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Or maybe that's just me I'm reading some other reviews and people are saying they where surprised lol you guys know this is Jim carrey right and I'm the year 2000.,"Me, Myself & Irene"
84,Jerique,Misinterpretation but hilarious nonetheless...,8,8 April 2010,"I won't tell you this is the funniest comedy I've ever seen because it's not. It's not unfunny, either, though. Jim Carrey portrays a ""schizophrenic"" Charlie / Hank who develops two personalities as a result of his ruined marriage.While, this comedy is funny at nearly every turn, it's actually inaccurate about what condition, it's trying to play off. Charlie/Hank suffer from Disassociative Identity Disorder. Schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities, for that matter.It's really sweet and romantic at times with Renée Zellweger and the chemistry with Carrey is just simple great. Peter and Bobby really know how to write their comedies but more than anything, know how to develop and write their characters.Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal all fall into a minority of comedies that can actually achieve loud laughter from their audiences. Me, Myself and Irene is a part of that minority. Carrey's extremities and insane antics as the ""lovable"" Hank Evans, it something to be hold.It's a riot to watch Hank flip out or the little things and go to town on each and every character in such an extreme way. Charlie seems to pop back up in the mix when it continues to get worse. Charlie seems to take the lumps and bruises that Hank tacks on.Supporting cast really puts on a great showing as well and without the three sons of Charlie, I'm not sure this movie would be as big a comedy. Carrey shines in the spotlight, but second to him is definitely the sons to his character.There's a lot of jokes that can really make you laugh and a condition like D.I.D. is not usually seen as funny, but this movie can make it happen. I'd definitely recommend this to any age appropriate person.","Me, Myself & Irene"
85,lib-4,Split personalities can be funny,6,25 March 2001,Jim Carrey is a master of physical comedy.  This movie is no exception. His jokes are sometimes crude and off-color but altogether a movie that made me laugh at least a dozen times.  My boyfriend laughed at his antics even more. The whole movie was silly from start to finish it held my attention to watch it two times.,"Me, Myself & Irene"
86,Shiva-11,Thank god the preview was free...,6,20 June 2000,"Me, Myself and Irene: Charlie Bailygates is the classic ""Nice Guy""- a devoted father, he is raising his three boys on his own, treats everyone with respect, and never gets angry.   Unfortunately, people take advantage of his good nature and treat him like a joke, until one day, his repressed feelings come to the surface and he snaps.  Diagnosed with split personality disorder he is given a prescription to avoid future rampages.   Soon after, while delivering a prisoner cross-country, Charlie loses his pills and chaos ensues.The Farrely brothers first gained notoriety with ""Dumb and Dumber"", but it was their success with the over-the-top-gross- out comedy ""Something About Mary"" that solidified their position as the new wunderkinds of humor.  I can only help they're soon dethroned.I will admit that there were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but in order to understand the level that they have sunk to imagine that in the first five minutes of the movie you get to view a close-up of a Great Dane defecating on a lawn.  Do I need to see this?  No.  Did I find it funny?  No - it was pathetic.   Other scenes are almost as bad - Carrey pretending to be an infant and sucking on a woman's breast, or the repeated use of a sex toy to garner laughs come to mind.  Also, attempts to shock the audience with never ending streams of profanity quickly grow tiresome  - after hearing mother****** for the umpteenth time, you become numb.  The performances are lackluster at best.No one would argue that Carrey is a gifted physical comedian - I especially enjoyed his work as an impersonator, because he not only got the voices bang on, he transformed into the person.  So, why is he choosing such lousy scripts? Carrey spends the bulk of the movie rehashing past performances - once you've seen ""The Mask"", and his Fire Marshall Bill character (from his ""In Living Color"" days) this seems like a cheesy rerun.If you are a die-hard Jim Carrey fan, and like anal insertion jokes, go to this movie - at a matinee.Note:  this is not suitable for kids, or anyone with an above average IQ or good taste. You have been warned.","Me, Myself & Irene"
87,fjhuerta-2,I thought I was going to get thrown out!,6,17 July 2000,"This is a straight, nonsensical comedy starring the master of facial expressions, Jim Carrey. On the same vein as ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""There's something about Mary"" (all of them by the Farrelly brothers), I found this movie to be a humorous ""Fight Club"". In fact, I liked a lot more how the conflict of multiple personalities is handled on this movie; the ending, actually, made a bit more sense (though it would be impossible to say this movie is better than Fight Club).The Farrelly brothers are to movies what Trey Parker is to animation: both spend most of their time aiming for the limit of what audiences might stand in front of a screen. Personally, I prefer the Farrely brothers, but it is surely a matter of taste (or lack of it). Be sure to go with your best friends, and get ready to laugh yourself silly over this one. It's a good one!","Me, Myself & Irene"
88,dobbin-4,"Me, Myself and this movie: how this movie made me laugh.",7,27 September 2007,"Me,Myself and Irene is another funny Farrely Brothers movie made purely for 2 hours of comedy. The movie is about a simple American cop(Jim Carrey) who after being dumped by his wife holds his anger and pain so long he develops SPD(Split Personality Disorder) and after getting told to take a Pretty blond girl(Renae Zellwegar)away gets caught in the web of assassins and lies that she was right in the middle of. The movie has many laughs that may be in bad taste but in the good way. The characters are very well portrayed by Jim Carey as the guy who pays the price for holding his anger, Renae Zellwegar as the girl and even Jim Carrey Characters kids play their parts magnificently. Overall the movie is made just to laugh and you should never go into a Farrely Brothers expecting to see an Oscar standard film or expect to see much Policticaly Correct stuff in them. I rate it 73%.","Me, Myself & Irene"
89,Tiger_Mark,Very Strong and Very Funny,10,16 June 2004,"Jim Carrey is a comedic genius, period. I don't care if you dislike him or hate his guts. If you deny his talent, you are kidding yourself. The Farrelly Brothers obviously realize this. So they did the smart thing, they turned him loose to go absolutely wild. And does Carey go wild. This film deals with a softy cop (played by Carrey) that has been dumped on his whole life. Moreover, everybody in the town treats him like a chump. One day, this softy cop just snaps, and an alter-ego is unleashed. This alter-ego is vile and sick, the complete opposite of Carrey's real character. Of course, like the Incredible Hulk, Hank (evil persona) is brought out whenever Charlie (good persona) is mad. Now, I know why some people dislike this film. Charlie's three African American sons use more curse words than Tony Montana trying to start an old lawn mower. There are numerous scenes with things placed into certain openings of the human body and well, some strong stuff. However, if you accept that this is just a silly comedy, everything is OK. I have laughed out loud all the way through this film, every time I have seen it. So, brace yourself and enjoy.","Me, Myself & Irene"
90,gws-2,Gross but Funny,7,2 December 2001,"This Farrelly brothers movie is gross but funny and it uses its gross humor to tell a story that is basically sweet.  Despite its use of tasteless jokes such as black jokes, short jokes, sexually aberrant jokes, a traumatic amputation joke, and several murder jokes, ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is a lot of fun -- if you know what you are getting into and steel yourself for it in advance.  Jim Carrey's rubber-faced acting and his talent for physical comedy coupled with Rene Zellweger's sweet vulnerability make you root for them. 7 out of 10.  Recommended.","Me, Myself & Irene"

92,AscendeSuperius,Humour with an underlying sadness,7,9 October 2020,"This film had all my favourite kinds of comedy. A whole lotta cleverly woven sexual humour with a dash of slapstick and racism. This just made the film the perfect cocktail for a night full of laughters for me. It was simply brilliant!However, I do believe that this kind of humour might not be for everyone. It follows a lot of the characteristics you tend to see in teen movies where teens have raging hormones, but for this, it was executed very well.Together with it came that sad feeling, that bad feeling you get at the pit of your stomach. Yes, I got that as well. To see Charlie and Hank going through their ordeals presented by the very talented actor Jim Carrey just made the whole film a joy to watch.Whilst it was fun to watch, there were some points that I felt was lacking. It checked all my boxes, theoretically it would have been my perfect movie. Its hard to explain, but it felt like it lacked that wow factor, the mind blown effect you get when you watch a top notch movie. This would be my only gripe with the movie.","Me, Myself & Irene"
93,KatMiss,HILARIOUS!,10,2 July 2001,"""Me, Myself and Irene"" is the latest comedy from the Farrelly Brothers, who have given us the comic gems ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Kingpin"" and the unbelievably funny ""There's Something About Mary"". It is an exercise in grossout humor, but it so skillfully done that it transcends the genre. Yet it received strangely negative reviews.This film is even better than ""There's Something About Mary"" and I think a lot of the credit goes to Jim Carrey, of which this marks a comeback. After establishing himself as a top actor with the dramas ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon"", Carrey makes his triumphant return to comedy. There are so many gags spit out at such a machine gun like pace, that it reminded me of Billy Wilder's great ""One! Two! Three!""""Me, Myself and Irene"" also stands out because we have characters we care about. Carrey's schizophrenic Charlie is his most likable character since Stanley Ipkiss in ""The Mask"". But also standing out is Renee Zellweger, who with this film, ""Nurse Betty"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"" is establishing herself as a major talent. She deserved an Oscar for ""Nurse Betty"" and she will hopefully receive a nomination for ""Bridget Jones' Diary"".A typical Farrelly Brothers movie has gags that work and gags that fizzle out. ""Me, Myself and Irene"" is their most successful work so far. I don't want to give away any of the wonderful jokes, but the first 20 minutes of this film had me laughing so hard that tears were flowing. How much more of a recommendation can that be?**** out of 4 stars","Me, Myself & Irene"
94,FrankBooth_DeLarge,Surprisingly hilarious,7,28 January 2005,"Back when I first saw the commercials for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. One day, I was at the video rental place and I decided to rent this because I like most of the Farrely brothers movies, and I also think Jim Carrey is hilarious. What I got was a big surprise, a hilarious movie that looks dumb on the surface, but really makes you laugh out loud.In the movie, Jim Carrey plays a man with a split personality named Hank. Hank is violent, but has some funny ideas and does some really weird things. I don't want to spoil anything, because the comedy of this movie should never be spoiled for anyone.There are some good actors in this movie that help keep the movie from becoming stupid. The advertisements did the film no justice, but you should see this anyway because it is exceptionally funny.","Me, Myself & Irene"
95,brandon_lee420,Funny without a doubt but yet lacks in story!,5,1 April 2010,"After hearing about Me, Myself and Irene by a friend, I decided to check into it. My first big surprise was that Jim Carrey starred in this film, which later turned out to be hilarious. When I saw Renee Zellweggers name in the cast, I was pretty disappointed considering her bad performances in nearly everything, but my sadness turned to happiness when I saw Anthony Anderson's was also cast with Jim Carrey and Renee Bubbleburger. What was even More and More surprising was that the Farrelly brothers were directing this. I knew from that point on that this film was going to awesome because the duo have created lots of funny movies, such as Dumb and Dumber, Osmosis Jones, and The Heartbreak Kid, which were amazing. My local library, luckily, kept a copy of Me, Myself and Irene so I quickly picked it off the shelf and into my library bag. As soon as I got home, I snatched the disk out of the case and inserted it into my DVD player. My hopes for this movie were so high and If it turned out disappointing, I would've chainsawed my body in half: Me, Myself and a Chainsaw. The film starts out like any other typical comedy film. Jim Carrey is Charlie Baileygates, a man who has everything: A wife, a future, and a....Job. But that all changes when the ""midget"" comes. Tony Cox is pretty funny in his cameo role as the Limo Driver. Even though his part maybe short but his laughs are big and humorous. Charlies wife leaves him for the attractive midget, leaving a big hole in Charlies life. He also has to raise some black kids who are actually the midget's sons. Not knowing that they are not his kids an adventure starts that puts Charlie, Charlie II, and Irene in a lot of trouble. Jim Carrey really hasn't changed from what he does best, and that is making people laugh, but sometimes he goes too over-the-top with his acting. His made up expressions are still a blast but they do make his acting way over-the-top. Renee Zellweger did not appeal to me as hard-to-get Irene who will eventually sleep with Charlie II. Her part is so clichéd. Anthony Anderson is more lovable than ever with his role as the fat-smart kid who usually makes the greatest jokes. Him and his brothers were too cool for this movie. There are MANY parts in which you will find yourself laughing out loud especially the scenes in which there is Charlie II.It had all started when a patrol officer named Charlie Baileygates was married. Unfortunately, his wife left him for the short black guy who was their limousine driver. Charlie is single again and taking care of 3 children. A series of misfortunes for Charlie developed an inner anger within him, then it came out, in a form of another personality known as Hank Evans. While Charlie is nice, kind, and usually calm, Hank is is the polar opposite of Charlie, being outrageous, mean, and short-tempered. Luckily, Charlie told his doctor about this other personality, and prescribed him with medication to suppress Hank. One day, Charlie was assigned to personally escort a woman named Irene Waters to a prison in upstate New York. Then, a series of unfortunate events happen as both Charlie and Irene run into a group of corrupt cops and Irene's abusive ex-boyfriend, in the middle of it all Charlie loses his medication and now fears that Hank will come out and makes the situation worse. While running, Charlie and Irene fall for each other (and so does Hank). Now, Both Charlie and Irene must stop the dirty cops, Irenes ex-boyfriend, and to stay one step ahead of Hank.If I had to choose my three favorite scenes out of the entire film, it would have to be: The part where he wakes up from a rough night, only to discover that he had slept with Irene and a dildo in his pants. It gets really funny when he finds out that he (by himself) forced it up there. Minutes later you see him in the toilet splashing water on his azz. My other favorite scene was when Charlie II was battling the cow on the street and how he had to shoot it in the head four times and twist its head. He thinks it is dead but at the end of the film you find out that cow was still alive. Funny sh*t! Jamaal and his two brothers came up with fresh new laughs that never get old. Jamaal is the most funniest one in the whole film after Jim Carrey. There are some flaws in this film and they are: the acting from Renee, which I cannot stress far enough, was a piece of broken old turd. She lost a star from me and I really hated the parts where the film would slow down. The story behind this is nothing new but it will not disappoint you. Period. The film will leave a smile on your face after it finishes and you can't wait for a sequel. Final Thoughts. If you like Jim Carrey as an actor then this film will appeal to you. The lame story and acting from Renee Zellweger was also very tedious. 7/10 - So good!","Me, Myself & Irene"
96,Asteri-Atypical,"More stupid, disgusting ""shock smut"". Even Carrey can't save this one!",2,3 December 2001,"I was disappointed in this juvenile film.While it had some potential in its concept it quickly revealed itself as a film which tries to get laughs by shocking the audience with disgust and teenage ""toilet humour"".  ""Pull my finger"" is a classy joke compared to most of this film.It's amazing Jim Carrey agreed to participate in this movie at this point in his career.  No matter what you might think of him, he's too good for such adolescent smut.  His portrayal was reasonable and was one of the best aspects of the film.  Still, however, it was too ""stereotypical Carrey"" to be noteworthy.There were some funny moments.  However they were not enough to fill a 30 minute sitcom repleat with commercials, titles and credits.There was far too much swearing.  It was clearly thrown in for more shock value.  There also was a very racist suggestion in this movie that black people will use ""F"" every other word and act like hoodlums no matter how intelligent they are, even if they are raised by an upstanding white state trooper.I can only recommend this film to teenagers and street hoodlums who think that the more shockingly disgusting, the funnier.  If you're a Jim Carrey fan, you may want to particularly avoid it so that you can maintain some modicum of respect for his work.","Me, Myself & Irene"
97,Mr. Pulse,"Suddenly, I find myself really enjoying this movie...",8,7 December 2001,"I'm a Farrelly brothers fan to be sure, but I didn't care for Me, Myself, and Irene when I first saw it in theaters.  I hadn't watched it again until last week when I caught it on television, and for some reason it's playing a lot better to me.  The jokes are suddenly working, the characters are a lot more involving, and I dig the movie a whole lot more.  Don't ask me why; perhaps there's more merit to the theory that I am mentally regressing than I thought.Jim Carrey stars as Charlie Baileygates, a Rhode Island state trooper who got a raw deal from his wife, and ends up repressing his emotions to the point that he develops a split personality; a fast-talking, sexually perverse, confrontational guy name Hank Evans.  Charlie has to bring Irene (Renee Zellweger) back to New York where there's a warrant for her arrest. Things go sour quick, and Charlie loses his medicine, so it's Irene and Charlie/Hank on the lamb.Carrey's performance seemed way over the top when I first saw this movie, but now I really appreciate it as quite an accomplishment.  He pulls off two characters, serious physical stunts, and does it in style.  Zellweger and Carrey have good chemistry, in both his personalities, and there are lots of funny bits.  The movies isn't perfect, and it certainly isn't as good as Kingpin or There's Something About Mary.  First off, the movie has an omniscient narrator that feels really odd, and doesn't work at all.  Second, Carrey's three foul-mouthed African American teenage sons are so over-the-top that they get real old real quick. Still, Carrey's really something to see here, and the movie, like all Farrelly Brother flicks, has a top notch soundtrack.  Definitely not a film for the ages, but one that I'm coming around to.","Me, Myself & Irene"

100,blairgallop7,A side-splitting film from Carrey and co.,7,2 October 2008,"Though I wouldn't think of this film as Jim Carrey's best,the film as a whole has some very funny moments and unlike a couple of Carrey films,it boasts a good lineup for a supporting cast which includes the likes of Chris Cooper,Robert Forster and Richard Jenkins among others.Charlie Baileygates(Jim Carrey) is a respectable 17 year veteran of the Rhode Island State Police who is a nice and helpful citizen until one day,something bad happens.Charlie flips and out comes Hank Evans,his foul-mouthed,psychotic alter-ego through a split-personality disorder.Renee Zellweger plays her character well.She plays Irene Waters who is a gorgeous woman on the lam who falls in love with Charlie,or so it would seem.Overall,an average to good film that is not excellent but has a strong base of supporting actors in the cast and well as some decent slapstick humour which has become a Jim Carrey trademark over all of these years.","Me, Myself & Irene"

102,RunningFromSatan,Jim Carrey back to (more) than his old self...,8,23 June 2000,"I am glad to see that Jim Carrey is still crazy and funny after a hiatus from these type of films.  But the Farrelly Brothers really brought him over what he has done in the past.  I don't feel like going into detail (you've heard it about 50 times on this site from other people already), but there are a lot of scenes in this movie that will either sicken you or make you laugh till you cry (a la ""There's Something About Mary"").  Sure, it's childish and ""bathroom-humor""-ish, but for those of you who don't want to ""grow up"" from these types of movies, it will be a laugh-fest.  A few scenes in particular -- the bathroom scene, the first montage when Charlie becomes Hank, the cow scene, and the scene with ""Whitey"".  I will admit though, the 3 kids' constant profanity did drag on, but I found it funny at parts when it fit.  I did find it amusing, however, for Carrey to use the F-word like that for some odd reason. :)  Bottom line, this movie is not for children or for the weak at heart (sorry, Grandma).  8/10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
103,Cylex,Jim Carrey at his best. You'll either love him or hate him.,9,22 June 2001,"I've just watched this film for the third time. I loved it even more than I did at the cinema. There, I often found myself laughing, while conscious of a silence from everyone else. But in the comfort of my living room I just let myself go. Jim is brilliant as both Charlie and Hank (especially Hank) Their voices, their attitudes, their expressions, couldn't be more different. Rene, the three coloured guys and ""Whitey"" also make the most of their roles.The visual and spoken humour is excellent, if not to everyone's taste. Frankly, I think some of Hank's victims (the neighbour, the woman at the checkout, the little girl) deserved what they got. And even if they didn't I found it impossible to keep a straight face.If you're as crazy about Jim as I am, this is one not to be missed. If you're not or if you're easily offended, then I can't recommend it.The soundtrack is good too. (Most of it.)9/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
104,ericjg623,Not very funny,4,4 June 2002,"I get the feeling the Farrelly Bros. tried too hard with this movie. Either that, or they simply thought that by casting Jim Carrey it would automatically be funny. For the most part, it wasn't. The potential was there, the basic premise is solid. Jim Carrey is Charlie, a state patrolman who is meek and mild mannered, he endures all sorts of abuse from everyone; his first wife, his next door neighbor, even people in a grocery store. It reaches a point where he finally snaps and develops a split personality. His ""alter ego"" is Hank, who goes around abusing all the people who abused Charlie and, in general, behaving like a totally obnoxious ass. Like I said, the premise has potential, but it's the execution that falls flat.First off, they made this movie way too complicated. Comedies should have a plot that doesn't get in the way of the laughs. This one does. There's just too much stuff going on and it gets confusing. Also, it's too long, nearly two hours. I distinctly recall a point a half hour or so from the end where I wanted them to wrap things up, but it just kept going and going. Also, too much of the humor seems forced, such as having three rap spouting science prodigies as Carrey's ""sons"" (courtesy of his first wife's affair with a black midget cab driver who's also a member of Mensa). But the final nail in the coffin is Carrey's character (more properly, characters). In a comedy, it helps greatly if the lead character is someone we can relate to, someone we can like or at least feel sorry for. But ""Charlie"" is simply TOO clueless, too pathetic, and ""Hank"" is too nasty while at the same time being too stupid to actually help Irene escape the bad guys. To sum things up, I'd say the Farrelly Bros. swung hard, trying to hit a home run, but the ball went foul.4/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
105,comquest,Pathetic,2,12 March 2001,"What do you do to save a comedy that isn't funny?  If you're Jim Carrey and the Farrelly Brothers, you add more lines to the script that end in 'muthafu**ka' or 'up your a**'.  This, at least, fills the theater with laughter if there are enough 10 year-olds in the audience.I gave this flick a '2' only because Renée Zellweger is in the cast. Without her, it would rate a 'zer0'.  If Carrey stars in any more turkeys like this one, he'll end up in the Home for Forgotten Actors.","Me, Myself & Irene"
106,Rattrap007,Not that bad..,9,7 January 2002,"Like one reviewer said before. If you are familier with the Farrelly Brothers work, or had seen a preview you should know to expect crude disgusting humor and were offended by this you are indeed an idiot! Crude humor is always in Farrelly Brothers movies. It just comes with the territory.The basic story is that Charlie marries his girlfriend, the smartest girl in town. But she falls for the limo driver, and african-american dwarf, who is only driving the car as a scientific experiment and she cheats on Charlie. She gives birth to the other guys kids, african-american triplets. She dumps Charlie and takes off with the other man. Charlie then looses the ability to confront his problems. He becomes a laughing stock of the town.Jump to present time. His kids are geniuses but curse worse than truckers. They are the top three students in school. He never blames them for what their mother did and loves his kids like they were his own. Charlie soon snaps and becomes Hank. Hank is his other personality who is pure agression and nastiness. He is the polar opposite of Charlie. Well his superiors have him take a vacation while transporting a girl, Irene, to a an upper NY police station.But her ex boyfriend/boss is a criminal and thinks she knows too much so he has her marked for death and has a couple of crooked cops after her. Charlie snaps between his and Hank's personality often which causes lots of pain for Charlie.  Charlie and Irene meet Casper, an albino, and continue their journey to try and keep her safe.The humor is a little crude at times like a cow laying in the road and Charlie tries to help by shooting it but the thing just won't die. In another scene a man has a chicken's head stuck up his ass with the rest sticking out. If you are easily offended I'd avoid this film. If you do like raunchy humor then this is a fairly good film. I'd give it about a 7/10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
107,snelling,Very Funny But Some Jokes Fall Flat,6,30 June 2000,"As often as I had seen the trailer over the past eight weeks, I still found it funny each time it came on. The two best jokes from the trailer were not in the movie itself. After Renee Zellweger kicks Jim Carrey and he falls down the hill, he pops up briefly in our sightline once more before continuing his descent. The brief pop-up was cut from the actual film. Another scene shows Carrey asking a small child at a diner, ""What are you lookin' at, Four-Eyes?"". The term 'four-eyes' was replaced in the movie by an unprintable expletive that made the scene far less funny. In fact, a lot of the humor in the movie was undercut by streams of profanity. The more these words are used, the less funny they become. I think profanity can be funny if used sparingly. There was really no substance here in terms of plot. The film was reduced to a series of very funny set pieces masquerading as a coherent storyline. There was nothing shown as to why Zellweger was on the run anyway. Some illegal shenanigans were mentioned, but that's not really a plot device. This is the main thrust that puts the story in motion and we do not know why it is even happening.","Me, Myself & Irene"
108,Ysman,These guys are trying way too hard . . .,3,19 June 2000,"The script for Me, Myself, and Irene was written well before There's Something About Mary and like Kevin Smith's Dogma, the fact that this is old material is painfully obvious.  In Mary, the jokes and sight gags made you laugh in spite of yourself.  In Irene, the jokes just made me stare in disbelief.  All of the jokes were placed for shock value only and did nothing to enhance or compliment the main storyline.  Even the bits that could have worked, such as Carrey's three sons and the albino kid, were funny at the first of the film but grew tedious by the end.  The Farrely brothers have fallen so far as to insert outrageously obscene curse words into the dialogue to generate laughs.  Instead all they do is generate boredom and waste an inspired performance from Jim Carrey.","Me, Myself & Irene"
109,jerry_dean67,"A few laughs, the rest was boredom.",5,24 June 2000,"This movie was only funny at points. And when it was some of the humor was entertaining. But unfortunitaly most of the movie was boredom.
The plot was pure stupidity. In fact, it was never even made clear what Irene was running from except that the bad guys were out to get her.I'll rate the movie a 5 for the few laughs it did provide. Based on the IMD rating scale this falls below the minimum 7 rating that makes a movie worthwile to see.","Me, Myself & Irene"
110,johanleupen,Outrageous humor. Not always funny but the Farrely's are creative!,7,4 August 2000,It's all an attempt to surpass the crazy humor that made There's Something About Mary such an (overrated) succes. But the Farrely's often try to hard to be shocking without being actually funny. This makes for a very bizarre movie but it still is entertaining though. I don't know how they keep coming up with this stuff. You have to be into this sort of thing. Don't see it if you didn't like their last film.,"Me, Myself & Irene"
111,Edu-16,Not bad,6,7 September 2001,"Look - this isn't a great movie. Let's be honest - few are.  This movie isn't about a complicated plot, or have indepth character acting. (Something I normally whine about alot....)  But the film never had 'pretensions', so I didn't really mind....But this movie is funny - sometimes very funny.  Not everything hits the mark, but stick with it. (The chicken thing was not typical of the humour in this film!)  Carey's 'inner struggle'/fight towards the end of the film was a real 'tour de force'.  He doesn't always get the material - but boy is he one talented guy!Most of the film has an edge to it - and some of the gags are quite gross. (we're back to the chicken thing again....)  But the 'what the hell' attitude has led to some great moments.  (..The breast feeding bit being a case in point)Rene Z excellent - the next mega-star one suspects....Didn't seem phased by some of the more way-out moments.  The current score of 6-ish seemed fair to me.","Me, Myself & Irene"
112,Nigel St. Buggering,The Farrelly Brothers not going far ENOUGH?!,5,9 July 2000,"Having loved (in a rather embarrassed fashion) both ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", and really enjoying ""Kingpin"", I must admit I was expecting a lot from this movie.  Needless to say, I didn't get a lot. Or even quite a bit.  Or much of anything, really. There are two big laughs, they're widely spaced, half the jokes are merely vaguely amusing, and the other half, while not quite dead on arrival, lays there and coughs up blood.Part of the problem is that the usually reliable Jim Carrey spends half the movie playing a character who simply isn't funny; not because of anything so whiny as insensitivity to mental illness, but because it's nothing more than an over-the-top imitation of Dirty Harry.  While this might have worked for about ten minutes, it gets old very fast at feature-length.The other problem, curiously, is that the directors famous for going too far seem to take the same tactic as their other work in hitting taboo targets, but they do so rather tamely.  If they'd pushed some of this stuff as far as ""Mary"" did with cripple jokes, for instance, they might have pulled it off. But really, albino jokes?  How many people out there are sensitive about albino references?A 5, at best.","Me, Myself & Irene"
113,mercury-26,how low can you go?,1,24 June 2000,"To describe how bad this film is, I'd have to use much profanity and vulgarity, but I'll refrain from stooping to its level.Unlike the other offerings from the Farrelly brothers, ""Me, Myself and Irene"" is a dumb movie that actually ends up being dumb. With the Farrelly's ""Dumb and Dumber,"" for instance, you laughed with it, not at it. At ""Irene,"" I found myself wanting to leave most of the time out of sheer embarrassment. I laughed a lot at the other films, but could barely manage a chuckle during this one. Where did they go wrong?Here the Farrellys combine the gross-out element of ""Kingpin"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" with the physical comedy of Jim Carrey. Carrey is as good here as he's ever been, when he's not grossing us out, that is. This guy's one of the greatest performers of all time. Why does he need to resort to potty humor any more?  It's only in there because it's what the Farrelly's audience has come to expect. To leave it out would be a disappointment.Leaving it out still wouldn't have been enough to save this film. I do like the premise: Charlie (Carrey), a guy who's been a pushover all his life, is pushed over the edge when his wife leaves him (for his wedding-day chauffeur driver, who happens to be a dwarf). This releases a side of Charlie he's kept locked away inside, basically his id, calling himself Hank. Hank does terrible things. He embodies all of Charlie's frustration and anger, doing things that the ego (Charlie) never would have allowed. Unfortunately, Hank's personality ended up with all the craftiness and brains when the two split. Charlie and Hank both end up falling for Irene (Renee Zellweger), a woman running from corrupt EPA officers. Hank's personality might have come in handy--if he weren't such an impossible-to-deal-with chauvinist pig.Now, had they actually told this story, the film might even have been decent. But the Farrellys seem so determined to take bad taste to new lows with each successive film, they've forgotten they're supposed to be telling a story at all.Grade: D-","Me, Myself & Irene"
114,pleiades10,The Baileygates boys were the funniest part of the film.,5,10 March 2001,"It's kind of sad when the supporting characters get more laughs than the big stars, but that's what you'll likely be facing when watching ""Me Myself and Irene"". The Baileygates boys are three... well... ethnically different young men from their ""father"", Officer Charly Baileygates, played by Jim Carrey. His sons exist as a clever spoofing of the movie concept that all young African American males must be portrayed as foul-mouthed, obnoxious, low class, sex maniacs. The Baileygates boys do drop obscenities, but while debating topics such as hacking into the Pentagon's computer files, how to read a helicopter flight manual in German, the breakdown of subatomic particles in molecules, and given the average size of a chicken's egg (in both centimeters and inches), would one indeed be able to be shoved up someone's ass? These young men certainly steal the show. The rest of the movie follows a predictable madcap zany adventure involving Charly Baileygates, as a Rhode Island police officer with a split personality, and Irene P. Waters, played disinterestedly by Renée Zellweger. Seems Irene is being framed over embezzling money from a golf course, and Charly (and his alter ago Hank) take it open themselves to protect Irene from the crooked agents and confused cops that are after her. One scene in which Charly and Hank ""battle"" for control of Charly's body, is more fascinating than funny. You'll wonder how many times Carrey had to practice to make it appear that an invisible man was pulling him up, and tossing him through plate glass windows. Overall, the Baileygates boys save this film from complete boredom... if only Carrey and Zellweger could've as well.","Me, Myself & Irene"
115,SamRag,Jim Carrey getting tired,5,19 August 2002,"I had resisted for a long time seeing this film for two reasons.  Jim Carrey playing Jim Carrey was getting a bit tired in my books, and further more I hadn't heard one good thing about this film.  But searching one night for a DVD to rent I decided to check it out anyway  mostly due to lack of anything better.  Well, I didn't regret renting it, which must be a good thing.  There were some laughable scenes, and Jim didn't too badly in playing two personalities.  The way his kids were portrait I liked especially, as it was such a comic criticism about in which way those sort of characters are generally represented.  But the film was weak.  It had a strange mixture of seriousness and comedy which didn't work.  The storyline was so thin that at times it seemed they were dragging out the scenes.  And most surprisingly, even though the material surely generated great opportunities for laughable scenarios, it was reduced to some falling-on-your-face scenes.  I enjoyed the beginning and the end, but became bored during the middle.   5/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
116,jtfsouth,Not worth it.,4,16 July 2000,"Going to the movie I thought knew exactly what I was going to see. Unfortunately, it was worst than expected. There was the obvious typical Carrey comedy, wild facial expressions, and physical humor, but it also seemed there was ALOT of cheap humor. Every other word in the film was ""F"" this and ""F"" that just to get a cheap laugh. The movie was not ALL bad, there was the chicken scene (which I never thought would be physically possible) and the cow scene was a plus. Also the 3 sons kept the humor on life support  when it really started to lag.     My big question is to Jim Carrey.... When is he going to make a film where he doesn't have to rely on the physical aspects of his routine to make a good movie? The Truman show was a good attempt and was heading in the right direction, but just as soon as you see him in a different light,,,,, there he goes, right back to his same old routine.","Me, Myself & Irene"
117,graestella,A Career Nadir,1,4 March 2010,"Maybe my vote of 1 will lower the average for this dreadful film. Where do you start ? Racist, regionalist, making fun of mental illness and disablement. The old 'gems' about how black people can't speak without swearing, and how they have huge genitals. This political incorrect rubbish from the 1970's must have been enjoyed by right wingers and rednecks all over the world. It was all without any ironic sense, or wink to the camera. Then we have the main plot. The split personality. This appeared ripped off from Terry Pratchett's 'Witches' Trilogy. There the character was a female witch, not a male cop, but otherwise the same. No I'm sorry, Terry's one was funny and witty. The rest of the plot was dire. I actually wanted the baddies to shoot Carrey as he was so horrible in both his personalities. Also I wanted poor Rene's character to dump him as a life married to either personality would have been unbearable. The amount of left over footage hinted at by the stills included in the closing credits, plus the awful continuity which was left in, presumably because the crew were as bored as we were and couldn't be bothered to fix the bugs, really says it all. A mess.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Carrey fans will get an absolute kick out of this--the scene where he fights himself is physical-comedy gold. In fact, you could call this entire movie ""Carrey gold."" A lot of the critics say the gross-out humor in the movie feels forced, but I actually thought it made it more exciting and enjoyable. Sure, most of it had nothing to do with the plot, but if you're going to make an R-rated comedy, I don't have any problem with gratuitous raunchy material being shoe-horned in there for no good reason. Make it raunchy! You won't get any complaints from me! On the down-side, this movie's way too long, and focused too much on its ""plot,"" which I neither followed nor gave a crap about. Screw the ""plot,"" and the running-around BS. That stuff just made the movie drag.Overall though, it's not too shabby. Just don't watch the TV-edited version, whatever you do.","Me, Myself & Irene"

(And, for the record, I'm also not too fond of Carrey's over-the-top style, but I pick and choose to make sure I see him in roles I would like.) The Farrelly brothers, known for their irreverent comedy, made this movie enjoyable and hilarious. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. Just expect twists and turns that leave you laughing. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and it's not for kids. (If you've never seen a Farrelly movie, you'll need to know this!) This is not laden with ""Oscar-quality"" performances at all, but just something to watch when you want to laugh and not think. -- Movies like this are good, if that is what you're looking for. The plot was great, and the casting (overall) was incredible. I can't get over Charlie's family. You'll see! I find them the most fun of all.

Jim Carrey movies are usually pretty good with the a few notable exceptions.  This will be one of them.  The humor was crass and was poorly written into the script.  The script was bad to begin with and the plot was predictable.  These two things combined just destroyed the film.  Jim Carrey, to his credit did his best but he had no help and the film as a whole, lacked taste.Overall, don't bother (2 out of 10).","Me, Myself & Irene"

I said I was not going to sit through another one of their movies, but when my sister (who felt the same about ""Mary"") said this one was better and that she actually liked it I gave it a chance on tv of course. Well, the interesting thing about this one was seeing just how offensive a movie could possibly be. It was amazing to witness the complete lack of humor or taste in scene after scene. I never thought they could do it, but the brothers who will remain nameless came up with one that immediately gets placed in the list of 10 worst films ever.

123,kingbad,I can't believe I liked this movie! (sorta),6,5 July 2000,"I consider the Farrelly brothers movies a guilty pleasure, the kind of thing you don't want to admit enjoying. They do have a way, though, of amusing small minds like mine, and Me, Myself, and Irene was no different. While the PC commandos will no doubt be out in force (yeah, I know, multiple personality disorder is NOT schizophrenia- give it a rest already, willya?), you can find plenty to enjoy in this movie if you just relax and put your brain on pause for a couple hours. Jim Carrey's contortions are amazing, and almost painful to watch- and for once he doesn't spend most of the movie just mugging for the camera. Renee Zellweger is charming and attractive, in an unconventional way, and the rest of the cast is effective. However, the actors playing Charlie's ""sons"" stole the show, with their obscenely hilarious Chris Rock/Stephen Hawking vibe. And I also loved the cameos by sports stars Brendan Shanahan, Cam Neely, and Anna Kournikova. I liked this movie- just don't tell anybody.","Me, Myself & Irene"

126,sloopydrew,"Jim Carrey's long-overdue return to comedy is, well, obviously still coming",5,25 June 2000,"Jim Carrey's long-overdue return to comedy is, well, obviously still coming. ""Me, Myself & Irene"" teams the Farrelly brothers (the minds behind ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"") back up with Carrey. Unfortunately, ""Dumb and Dumber"", this ain't.  The jokes are recycled from past Farrelly movies, the plot is convoluted, uninteresting and completely unbelievable, and there are more intriguing romances happening right now behind the bleachers at your local high school.  The Farrelly's, who have obviously bought into their own ""semen hair-gel"" related hype, haven't really structured a story as much as they have strung together a bunch of fart jokes and other sordid material.  Gross can be funny, but only if there's something behind the crudity to make it work.  This movie does get a few laughs, but only because of how well Carrey handles the weak material he has been given to work with.  In a couple of scenes, Carrey's gift for performing physical comedy actually saves this film from being a complete disaster, and winds up turning it into something more like an Amtrak derailment, with only minor injuries.","Me, Myself & Irene"
127,fiozinho,"Crude, lewd and cr*p.",5,30 July 2000,"Someone has to tell Jim Carrey that simply pulling faces won't wash any more. Here he basically does a 'Mask' without the mask, and it's painful to watch him straining to try to squeeze laughs out of situations which are just not funny. Of course, he's not directly responsible for the crass script and treatment, ('Mary' had its crude moments but won us over with a lovely dash of charm - 'Irene' is as charmless as you could possible get), but I wonder whether an actor with less idiosyncratic baggage might not have been able to carry it off. As for the film per se, well, if you think dildos and anal soreness are intrinsically funny, then this is probably the film for you. Me? I smiled once.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Many jokes are so shocking that you forget to laugh. However, since I have gotten back home after watching it last evening, I have been laughing, and am still laughing. This is not a family  movie. The jokes are cruel, gross and absolutely hilarious. Although this is definitely a must see for Carrey and Farrely Brother fans, I have to say it doesn't even come close to level of quality that ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Something About Mary"" were. This movie has jokes that will make you feel guilty about laughing at them, but you won't be able to stop laughing. One problem with the movie that will result in loss of revenue is that it doesn't have that much repeat value. One of the Carrey's personality Hank is quiet dark, and reminds you of the Cable Guy. This gives the movie a bit of depressing atmosphere. Also the beginning is actually a bit sad really.
Some of the jokes are repeat from previous efforts and some are stolen from other Carrey movies, like the scene where his both personalities are fighting each other and he starts to kick his on ass like in Liar Liar. That was a let down, because we have already seen it. Also some of the jokes, like profanity used by his kids were repeated too often and without any creative change, which also dulled it a bit.However, Rene Zewlliger was just gorgeous and sweet. She was just perfect and for her alone you can see this movie twice.","Me, Myself & Irene"

That said, it's hard for me to comment on Me, Myself & Irene without saying something nasty.I am not sure what kind of actor Jim Carrey sees himself as. I don't think he ever did anything groundbreaking, but on his resume there are a few good movies and performances. Does he think this stuff will really improve his status? Atrocious, childish, and really, really unfunny are the first words that came to my mind while watching this movie. Am I supposed to laugh because he makes noises while breathing? Am I supposed to laugh at the swearing, at him washing his butt in a bathroom sink or at a 2"" dildo? Acting-wise (and with the help of the awful script), I hardly found anything interesting about Jim Carrey's role. His split-personality thing was more like an excuse for him to act like a complete idiot. And I don't mean an idiot in a funny way, like say, Beavis and Butthead or -- in a way -- even his character in Dumb and Dumber... an idiot, pure and simple, one that I could feel no sympathy for at all.Renee Zellweger did an OK job, but again, her character was not interesting.Maybe it's just because I don't like this kind of comedy at all, but I can't rate this more than 2/10.","Me, Myself & Irene"

But who would watch this expecting anything different? There is precious little plot, what plot there is being little more than a peg on which to hang a few typically gross visual jokes. Renée Zellweger jogs along without expending too much effort, but then character development is hardly a strength of this film, despite its supposed subject matter. The real stars are the Baileygates triplets, though don't ask where they acquired their ghetto talk in tranquil Rhode Island.Several of the jokes work, several don't. Persist right to the end though, even after the credits have rolled, if only to find out the cow's fate. An enjoyable way to idle away a couple of hours, although a pair of scissors on some of the ""plot"" scenes might have been a useful addition as it runs about 20 minutes too long.","Me, Myself & Irene"
132,MovieRat-2,"Three Words, ""WHAT THE (beep)!!!""",4,16 July 2000,"Up until now, I never believed there would be any movie that would be worst than ""South Park""...""Me, Myself, and Irene"" proved me wrong.Granted this was a hilarious movie...but that is beside the point. Unlike South Park, which I might see again if I am desperate for a good laugh, I felt that this movie went overboard. For those of you who are wondering what I am talking about, picture a movie with the shock factor of South Park with the nonstop foul language of a black comedy and the mind of a pervert who has this fetish with sex toys...and you have a glimpse of what ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" is all about. I don't care if it is funny, I didn't pay good money to see 3 minutes of nonstop footage of a guy with a chicken shoved up his rear end. I also thought the foul language was totally unnecessary, especially since most of it came from the three black actors who played the three sons.AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!","Me, Myself & Irene"
133,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"C'mon fellas, I know you can do better than this",6,29 June 2000,"This is one of those movies where I'm having a hard time putting my finger on why it didn't work for me. It had laughs, sure it did, some big ones, but it could have been so much more.I'll start with Jim Carrey. This guy is good. Ace Ventura aside, this guy can make me laugh. Hell, Cable Guy is one of my top three favorite comedies, and Dumb and Dumber is probably in the top five. I spent the first half-hour anxious for him to go mental (oops, not very PC of me, eh?), and when his ""Hank"" personality finally shows up, I wanted him to go back to the nice guy. I guess my problem with Hank is that he isn't so much funny as he is... well... gross and nasty. Not to mention that it took me a long time to adjust to the voice Carrey was doing as Hank. Now, gross and nasty is not nearly enough of a reason for me not to like something. South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut, There's Something About Mary, American Pie, I sat through all these movies (next to my little sister, no less) and laughed like hell. I didn't feel any discomfort during those movies, but I did during this one. And when I wasn't feeling uncomfortable at what was happening on the screen, the rest of the audiance was, which, in turn, made me uncomfortable. Does that make sense? Okay, just stick with me here for a minute. The cow scene (that's all that needs to be said for those that have seen the movie). As I was watching it I was laughing loud and hard at the expense of the poor animal, and then I realized, to my surprise, that I was the only one in the theatre laughing. My little sister next to me lets out this little,  ""Aww..."". My point is, there are many of these kinds of uncomfortable silences in this movie, and that's not a good thing for a comedy.Many of the jokes just don't work. I wish they did, but they don't. But at the same time, I laughed a lot during the movie, so I'm torn. I guess I expected so much more form the re-teaming of the Farrely brothers and Carrey. Maybe my expectations were too high. So often it seems like the film makers are screaming at us, ""Look at this! Can you believe what we're doing? Aren't we outrageous?"", and just being shocking isn't enough, it needs more laughs. This is easily the most offensive comedy I have ever seen (not counting the Pauly Shore collection of gems). That alone should make the movie worth seeing, I just wish it was funnier. 6/10 stars. G'night!","Me, Myself & Irene"

I find this movie as being a complete riot of gags and funny situations, with many pervert lines and lack respect for puritan viewers. I like that. It has sexual content, it jokes with hilness, it has bad-taste jokes!!! Great! I like it because of that: makes it different. Jim Carey has again some great moments, mainly the way he changes it's facial expressions when he turns into Hank. Those moments are the greatest parts of the movie and by no means he's doing a worse job than usual.See it with open mind, and take it easy on the more shocking moments. They're just fooling around.","Me, Myself & Irene"

By the way are you sure that when the child swears who is jumping rope in the street that this is not a voice-over done by an adult. No matter she was paid and you hear more than that at your local school yard anyway. On with the movie; from the start Tony Cox as the Mensa Midget and the father of Jim Carrey's three adorable kids, and to Rene Zelewegger as the hardened criminal Jim Carrey must transport back to upstate New York. This is a cute movie that I like to watch every chance I get, and I am definitely a fan of the Farrelly brothers comedy films(***1/2 out of ****)","Me, Myself & Irene"
136,nutz4n64,Definitely reeks of Farrelly style,9,24 June 2000,"To put it simply, I loved `Dumb and Dumber' and `There's Something About Mary.'  The Farrelly brothers are fast becoming my favorite directors (ahead of Mel Brooks).  Their latest film, `Me, Myself, and Irene,' was not of the quality of these films, but makes me laugh nonetheless.  At the start, I was disappointed to hear the voice of a narrator, Hank's first scene was not all that I hoped it would be, and I thought that this movie was sitting squarely on a rating of about 6.  However, as the story began to pick up, particularly with Irene finding Charlie in his hotel room (great embarrassment scene), I found myself enjoying it more and more.  Also, the scene where Charlie confronts his other personality reminded me of `The Nutty Professor,' which was another great take.  By the end, I found it to be a terrific comedy. For those that like low brow humor, specifically of the Farrelly type, this one is for you.  9 of 10","Me, Myself & Irene"
137,yeah_baby_5,One of Jim Carrey's funniest,10,21 January 2004,"It is pretty obvious that the Farrelly Brothers directed this movie. I couldn't stop laughing. I laughed right from the beginning to the end just before the credits hit. One of the funniest things in the movie were Charlie's (Jim Carrey) children. They were so big, you could hardly see Charlie sitting on the couch with them. If you haven't seen this movie and want to, look for a few hidden things in it but I won't tell you so I don't spoil the movie. I had a good laugh 10 out of 10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
138,t_brown_17,AKA: Jim Carrey's movie,5,22 October 2000,"In a nutshell, this film would be nothing without Jim Carrey. The Farrelly Brothers have the ability to make an audience laugh. They also have the ability to make an audience yawn, waiting for the next laugh. The laughs here are few and far between. Zellwegger's character is so cut-and-dried, it's really hard to care for her at all. One scene where Carrey's thumb is shot off is particularly bad (you can still see his thumb). The Farrelly Brothers should thank their lucky stars they have capable actors handling their material. Cause if they didn't, this stuff wouldn't even qualify as a National Lampoon installment. Bravo to Jim Carrey, though, for alone making this film watchable.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Me Myself and Irene which is directed by theres something about mary writers Bob and Peter farrley.  The movie tells the story of Charlie a sad sap who can't even run the law in his own town.  Well after being told to p**s off and park a car. Charlie starts to flip out and develops a second personality Hank who is the master of all evil.  He does stuff to people and is told that he has multiple personalities.  Well he then is told that he needs to take a few days off and go find himself.  Well that is were it all goes to hell when Irene who is played by Renee Zellweger shows up in his police station for speeding heres were I will stop beacuse you have to see it to find out what happens next but I will tell you this It is very funny and even though it doesn't have a great plot it shows that Jim carrey knows what to do.  Some of the funny parts are with the three black sons of carrey.  Don't get what I mean go see 7 and half out of 10 stars.,"Me, Myself & Irene"
140,swipht1,I laughed my bag off.,8,20 April 2003,"Once again, Jim Carrey proves that he is one of the funniest comedians of our time. His hilarious performance is one of the best I've seen in years.

142,Geordie-4,Very funny but not quite his best,8,16 July 2000,"This is a really funny movie.  The laughs really come in bunches in this film.  The scene where Carrey's character goes nuts and makes a rather risque announcement over the supermarket loudspeaker, then harasses a nine year old who had previously disrespected him, then ends up in a rather weird situation with a nursing mother (don't ask) and drives the car through the window of the barber shop was classical.  Also whenever he was talking Ebonics....very funny (don't make me hafta bust a cap).  I found some of those scenes with the big black guys mildly offensive and racist though.  I don't see why it should be funny just for those guys to talk how they usually do.  I mean, they were funny, but to put them in a movie and basically mock them for talking the way they do....I dunno.  I was laughing but I was also like, I dunno about this.  Still, the movie was hysterical. I don't think it's as funny as There's Something About Mary, but it wasn't far off.  And I don't think this is as good as Dumb and Dumber, the Ace Ventura movies or Liar Liar, but it is certainly hysterical in places and well worth the price of admission.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the foul language used by his African American sons. The f word was repeated constantly without a leavening of humour. There was basically no plot except for Carreys facial contortions. He is the unfunniest comedian I've ever seen. I made the decision to switch off halfway through this lemon and haven't regretted it. I suspect the demographic audience was teenage youths. This movie is WORSE than ""The Tiger Woods Story""","Me, Myself & Irene"

This movie was filthy as well but I enjoyed it. Jim Carey is great as playing Charlie and Hank. Like Eddie Murphy, he proves that he can make people laugh by playing two very different characters.  The plot was decent as well except for the scene how Charlie gets rid of Hank. It was weak.","Me, Myself & Irene"
147,POG-2,"Crude humour, but good film!",9,7 September 2000,"The humour is admittedly very crude and the chicken up the a** is only one of the more glaring examples. However, the fact that the policeman said he'd kill their father when he sets eye on him is much more offensive. In contrast to ""The Nutty Professor"" (one of my ""worst ever"" films) I didn't feel offended by this film. On the contrary, the Farrelly brothers simply used the subversive power of humour here with a sound ethical edge (unlike the above Eddie Murphy film). The humour that goes with likeable Charlie is totally different to the humour that goes with partly funny, but basically annoying Hank and it's Charlie who wins. I also liked Charlie's boys. This blend of good boys (""Give Daddy a kiss!"") and rap artists with foul language which is mirrored in Charlie is quite hilarious. I'm amazed that anyone can read this as ""racial slur"". I once saw a talk show with a handicapped man ("" whatever challenged"") who pointed out that handicapped people also make jokes about handicaps (like the Jews themselves had many jokes about Jews in concentration camps). It's usually their official representatives and non-handicapped people who complain. The people who demand PC in such cases, don't understand what humour is all about. Not only what is said is important, but also how it is said, the submerged attitude. I used to not like Jim Carrey but since ""The Truman Show"" I've changed my mind. There are more shades to his performance than I used to notice.","Me, Myself & Irene"

150,PhilauraJ,Unexpectedly Hilarious!,8,28 October 2002,"First let me say I really DID NOT LIKE ""Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb & Dumber"", But I totally  enjoyed this film.  It has a heart, that the other two do not.  Unlike ""Something About Mary"" the jokes are not based on people's physical pain or disabilities. Or in ""Dumb and Dumber"" where I just could not relate to or care about the ridiculous characters.  Instead, MM&I portrays a sweet, caring underdog that is being horribly taken advantage of by everyone and gives him a leg up in the world with the emergence of a split personality that takes revenge. This split personality is weird and a sicko but he kicks ass.  He's an unlikely hero, but gotta love him for coming to the rescue. It's silly fun that showcases Carey's talents very well. Jim has got to be the all time best physical comedy performer.","Me, Myself & Irene"
151,Geoff-21,"Three huge laughs, the rest just ok...",8,28 June 2000,"Let me say first off I think Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary are brilliant.  I even read Peter Farrelly's books Outside Providence and The Comedy Writer (which, by the way, if that ever gets made into a movie I'll be first in line).  I think the Farrelly brothers are crude, rude, and hilarious.  Therefore, I am sorry to say that I though Me, Myself, and Irene was somewhat of a disappointment.  As I told a friend, it has three moments of bring yourself to tears laughs (for me: the first Hank sequence, the wounded cow, and Charlie's morning-after trip to the bathroom).  The rest was worth a rental at best.  Too bad, Jim Carrey's Charlie/Hank acting job is phenomenal, and Renee Zellweger is cute too.  I couldn't believe they used a narrator a la Dukes of Hazzard and the three kids annoyed me most times instead of making me laugh.  I'm giving this a trepidatious 8 for those three scenes and Carrey's acting.  But if you think those three scenes suck, you're going to want your money back.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Compare this to Being John Malkovich, and it's like a rich, juicy steak compared to a Big Mac. It's bland, easy junk food cinema. For all it's bad points (Charlie, over-emphasised plot, an over-serious dwarf.) it's good points (the genius loudmouth triplets, Whitey, Hank shows up)  just save it. If you come looking for the auteur work of the Farelly's, you'll be dissapointed. It just isn't stupid enough. If you want intellectual enterainment, watch the Coen brothers or Being John Malkovich.  If you want a time-filling, pleasing comedy, Me, Myself and Irene does it's job (Like the over-rated There's Something About Mary.) The Farellys are swiftly becoming a one-trick pony. Their next film has to be a hit, or they'll look Dumb And Dumber.","Me, Myself & Irene"
153,jennifer-99,Jim Carrey saves the day!,7,27 December 2000,"I'm not usually a fan of mindless gross out humour that generally targets the 12-16 year old audience.  And, as far as the ""Farrelly Brothers"" go, I dislike their brand of comedy and I absolutely hated ""Something About Mary"".
However, I think the Brothers would do well to cast Jim Carrey in more of their movies.  I found Dumb and Dumber to be absolutely hilarious and, once again, he has made ""Me, Myself and Irene"" a truly enjoyable piece of comedy. Without his fabulous physical performance, this film would be reduced to a string of sight gags and toilet humour which we have all seen before in dozens of other movies.  I know that this movie was not exactly embraced by critics which blows my mind.  Seeing that everyone completely adored ""Something About Mary"" - basically all the same jokes without Jim Carrey to pull them off.  This movie is not for everyone, but any astute movie watcher and any true Jim Carrey fan will instantly see the uncompromising energy which he poured into his 2 characters.  He is truly a wonder to behold and will go down in history as one of the greatest physical comedic actors of all time. 
Say what you will about the movie, but it really is a shame that the Academy consistently overlooks Carrey's gifted performances.  He has proven that he is a talented actor with the range to perform both serious and comedic roles.  Gifted dramatic actors are a dime a dozen in Hollywood - I defy you to find a comedian who can do the things that Carrey does on screen and who can make audiences laugh with just a look.  A rare gem indeed. 
I didn't go to this movie expecting a deep plot, beautiful cinematography or an award winning screenplay...I went expecting to laugh.  And I did, a lot. Thanks to Jim Carrey.  While Zellweger and the 3 actors who portrayed Charlie's sons were entertaining enough, Carrey singlehandedly saves this picture and that is enough for me to give it a ""thumbs up"" recommendation. 
Jim's done it again!","Me, Myself & Irene"
154,suspie,Still Charming,7,4 October 2000,"There are a lot of things wrong with this film. The story itselfisn't remotely interesting. Some of the jokes are fart-fetched and some just aren't funny. The face-pulling ofJim Carrey is something that we all have seen, isn't funnyanymore and simply embarrassing. And the longer the movie runs, the more it starts to crash on its own weight.That said, this movie also has a definite charm to it (asSOMETHING ABOUT MARY) had that makes it an enjoyable view. The Jim Carrey character is nicely done, and especially the first 15 minutes build up his characterperfectly. Everything about this movie makes you believethat the makers simply had fun making it. So you're alwayslaughing WITH the movie, and not AT the movie (like I didfor the most part of SCARY MOVIE).","Me, Myself & Irene"

The thing with the cow was hilarious, but over all this was a disappointment. Jim Carrey's split personality thing was just a less funny version of his performance in The Mask.

But they weren't advertising thins film as it really was. The trailers make it look like a different type of comedy than it is. It has a lot of really sick humor that was really funny but at one point I think it went a little overboard (Hank  and the woman with her baby- you know what I mean) . I still think Its hillarious, but not what I was expecting. I will buy this movie as soon as it arrives on video. Also, I think the commercials should have shown the three kids more. They are pivotal characters in the movie but the trailers gave us only glimpses of them. Still a great movie if you can hack the gross-out humor.","Me, Myself & Irene"
157,seanahalpin,I had a love - hate relationship with this film,5,19 February 2002,"I found myself both loving and hating this film.First, the hate part. As a mental health worker, I object to the way in which this film spreads misinformation and stereotypes about mental illness. Young people with a mental illness may see this movie and feel demoralised, isolated and stigmatised. The marketing for this movie was so bad that the SANE stigma watch program managed to get the makers to withdraw some of the promotional materials, which were heartless and inaccurate. I don't think the extremes and stigmatisation were necessary to make the film work.Second, the love part. This movie, despite being politically incorrect, despite being crass, crude, rude and tasteless, despite being excessive in every way - made me laugh so hard that at times I was nearly bursting my sides and my eyes were running with tears.Unlike other reviewers, I found such scenes as the breast, the lawn crap, the cow, and (especially) the dildo hilarious. Tacky - yes. Awful - yes. Something not to show grandma - yes. But so funny and sick that I had to laugh or I would die.The movie (if watched while in the right mood) provides a real juvenile laugh that hasn't been felt for years. I found myself weeping with laughter and yet mentally chastising myself for doing so. Perhaps that's just me.
I gave it 5 out of 10. The stigmatising attitudes cost it 5 marks.","Me, Myself & Irene"
158,spazierganger,"Carrey does a good job, but humor wears out fast",4,17 July 2000,"First off, the good stuff: Jim Carrey does a great job in this movie. He's really the only actor who could've played this role. He's a genius at physical comedy which definitely comes in handy in a movie like Me, Myself and Irene. However, he hasn't been given much to work with. Sure, there's plenty of sick jokes to keep the average 12 year old boy entertained (if he can get into the theater), but for everyone else, the humor wears out. It's based solely on shock value, which goes away when you get used to it. The difference between this movie and a movie like There's Something About Mary (the Farrely Bros. last film) is that Something About Mary had heart, in addition to the gross-out humor. It was a movie that could gross-you out, but still had some charm to it. Me Myself and Irene, however, is a relentless barrage of this gross-out humor, with none of the endearing qualites of Something About Mary. And resemblance of a plot gets lost behind sick jokes, chickens up the a**, and other stuff like that. The first half of the movie is funny, but after that, it gets old. It's a shame that a talent as great as Jim Carrey is so wasted in this movie.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Jim does a very good job of kicking his own ass, again, but that's about all.I think African American's would be more offended by this than us Skitso's, because of the stereo typical foul mouth trio.  But it's all in fun right? I guess if you a up-tight African American Skitso, this is not the film for you.For some reason I just can't decide if this move was good or bad.

162,ralphgillis,Below-Average Comedy,4,24 September 2021,"25 September 2000.Me, Myself and Irene is the latest comedy by the Farrely Brothers who are known for their ultra-successful 1998 comedy called There's Something About Mary, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Their newest movie is definitely a step down in quality.Jim Carrey saved this movie from becoming a total failure. Without him, this would be one of the most lacklustre comedies ever made, the story is extremely uninteresting and the gags don't land most of the time. The plot of the story is handled really badly, everything goes at a pace you can't keep up with. You don't know the purpose of any of the characters or what their role is. All you are left with is an unmemorable and uncaptivating duo (Renee Zellweger/Jim Carrey) that really does not catch the interest of the viewer. Whilst you are lost in the clutter, which is the story. You are left with goofy, bizarre and downright hilarious facial expressions that can bring out the emotions of cringe or laughter. Renee Zellweger is painfully average, she never challenges herself as an actress. She should step out of her comfort zone and display everything she has in herself on the screen to create a good performance, if she has the skills. It has not yet been proven that she has what it takes. The jokes are standard, one or two stand out but nothing comes close to the effective slapstick humour of There's Something about Mary.I don't recommend Me, Myself And Irene because it succeeds in showing how crazy Jim Carrey can become but every other character is incredibly dull. The story is dreary and surprisingly perplex to understand. It's a bump in the road for The Farrely Brothers.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I'm not offended by any type of humor, no matter how sick as long as it's funny, and the laughs here are just too far and few between. Jim Carey was born to play this role and I'm sure the Farrelly brothers wrote it with him in mind, but the supporting characters and the storyline is so weak  it really detracts from Carey's performance.
A lot of reviewers say that the trio that play Carey's sons steal the movie...I don't know why they say that. Are black geniuses, swearing funny?....not here. The concept is good, but it wears real thin after only a few minutes. This movie has taken a lot of heat for poking fun at things like schizophrenia and albino's. I don't see what the big deal is here. I would think an adult holding a child's head under water and calling them f***face would cause a bigger furor.I gave this movie a vote of 6 of 10 strictly on the basis of Jim Carey's performance.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Another gross out comedy along the lines of ""There's Something About Mary"", ""Me, Myself and Irene"" is brimming with lots of fun and great characters. The story goes like this: Charlie Baileygates (Carrey) is a nice guy Rhode Island State Trooper who fell in love with the popular girl (Trayler Howard). On their wedding day, she falls in love with the black limo driver (Tony Cox, in a small role) she gives birth to three black babies: Shonte Jr Bailygates, Jamaal Bailygates, and Lee Harvey Baileygates (Jerod Nixon, Anthony Anderson, and Mongo Brownlee). She leaves Charlie and he is left to raise the three boys. After she left him he became a victim of multiple personality disorder. Charlie goes back to work and his alter ego Hank Evans (Carrey) comes out to play. The State Troopers take in a woman, Irene P Waters (Renee Zellegger) and Charlie must escort her to another location to get her away from her ex boyfriend. Along the way Hank comes out to formally introduce himself to Irene, and chaos ensues. Carrey and Zellegger work wonders with each other and bounce the story back and forth from each other. All in all this is probably one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies to date.3 out of 4 stars","Me, Myself & Irene"
165,Wolf30x,Pushes the line of tastelessness like never before.,7,23 June 2000,"I once thought that There's Something About Mary was as far as you could push the envelope before a film became tacky and flat out offensive, yet somehow the Farrely Brothers managed to go even further with Me, Myself and Irene. It really makes you wonder how the had the nerve to actually write some of these jokes down on paper, and for Jim Carrey to act them out. This film is darker than the other Farrely movies, but that really works well, especially with Hank, Carrey's characther's dark side, who probably does some of the raunchiest things seen or inferred in a movie aimed at a mainstream audience. The best part is when he goes off the deep end for the first time. What you see in the TV ads hardly scratches the surface of this movie, although you'll probably never be able to look at a ""Got Milk"" ad the same way again. I think the only problem with the Farrely brothers movies is that they tend to write rather straight forward movie plots, and load them with cartoonish humor, which works, just as long as you don't think about it too much. This is definetly a movie to see if you liked their previous flicks, but if you're easily offended, stay away.","Me, Myself & Irene"
166,esbenpost,Jim gets another 20 mio - but what do WE get ?,4,8 March 2002,"A truly mediocre flick. The Farrelly's have never been my cup of tea - they remind me too much of old college-comedies or even Police Academy - but I thought Jim Carrey maybe would be able to lift at least some of this movie himself. He has done it before and seem to have built a career on making movies, where he is funnier than the actual movie itself (Not a lot of actors can do that. Imagine The Truman Show with Adam Sandler...uuuuuh) Me, Myself and Irene has a couple of good scenes in it - I liked the first 15 minutes or so. But all in all, there isn't even enough comedy to make a 25-minute sitcom. It tries to be funny, then tries to be thrilling, and tries to be funny again. It TRIES way too hard. Somehow I feel I should be a Jim Carrey-fan, but I find it hard when he keeps on making movies in the ""Cable Guy""-category.","Me, Myself & Irene"
167,bryanplateado,A great and funny movie.,8,31 December 2020,"Me, Myself and Irene has a lot of great moments in it. Jim Carrey gives a really good performance in this movie. This movie always has me entertained. This movie barely gets boring. Some problems I had with the movie are there were a couple jokes that didn't work for me. My other problem is the romantic aspect of the movie didn't really interest me that much. Me, Myself and Irene is a great and funny movie. Even though I do think Dumb and Dumber is a better movie than this movie, Me, Myself and Irene is still an enjoyable movie.","Me, Myself & Irene"
168,neil.harris,"Direct and to the point, as always.",9,25 September 2000,"I went into this movie with high expectations.  Firstly, I am a big Carrey fan who has seen all his films, and secondly I loved Dumb and Dumber and There's Something about Mary, so this film was a must see.       I was not disappointed.  After a slightly low opening and long credit section the action soon began to flow, with great visual gags and some clever comedy devices used throughout.  Jim Carrey was excellent, using his exceptional slap-stick and rubber face to great effect.  I couldn't have picked someone who could have beat themselves up as convincingly as him.  He did not hog the limelight however, as the supporting cast were also outstanding.  His three ""sons"" were very good, and made me laugh on their own, and Irene was very beautiful ""girl next door"", without super model looks.(I hate that saying as well, but it really does apply here)   The plot was weak, but hey who needs a plot when there is poo, chicken and dildo gags aplenty?!  Not me, thats for sure.Altogether a great film, and a fun evening out, don't listen to the reviews about the poor plot lines or unbelievable story, just put some laughter in your life for gods sake!!!!Cheers Neil","Me, Myself & Irene"
169,Drake_Clawfang,A Perfect Movie for Carrey,8,5 March 2006,"This is the kind of movie Jim Carrey was born to play. Few movies can make the best of his comedic prowess. The Mask was one. A Series of Unfortnate Events was another. And then there's Me, Myself and Irene.Carrey plays Charlie Bailygates, a Long Island cop. Charlie's wife cheated on him for the duration of their whole marriage with their limo driver, finally leaving him with 3 (black) kids from her affair. The town is laughing behind Charlie's back, and he knows it. Sad to say, Charlie is a nice guy, and no one feels bad about exploiting the fact that the poor guy won't stand up for himself. As the narrator himself puts it: when you can't deal with your own problems, it's hard to deal with others.That's where Hank Evans comes in. Hank is rude, crude, and feels no shame about kicking the ass of anyone he doesn't like. Hank has a raging libido, a big mouth, and a serious mean streak. And as he himself puts it, unless Charlie learns to deal with his life on his own, Hank is going to have to move in for good.Carrey plays polar opposites in this movie, and it rocks. He can play such a variety of roles, this movie lets him play the nice guy and the mean guy. Good cop, bad cop: That's Charlie and Hank! This movie simply is hilarious, and a must see for any Jim Carrey fan.","Me, Myself & Irene"

The Movie is a combination of lewd sexual innuendos and crude physical jokes. For the mindless, it is perhaps funny, but to those of us in the frightening world of reality, it doesn't fly. Those Farelly boys should definitely try their hands and some adult comedy. The only positive thing to say about this film, is that it's only 1 1/2 hrs. and there's no ""hair gel"" involved.","Me, Myself & Irene"

(I'm just keeping it light, It's worse than that!)The so-called CRUDE HUMOR in this film turns GROSS, it's OVERDONE!! I can't even bear to tell you! It's so BAD! This Definitely NOT I REPEAT NOT JIM CARRIE'S BEST FILM! It's a total pain in the a--! From me this film gets a ""2"". It's lucky to get that I actually would rate it a ""1"". That's how BAD this film is! It's TERRIBLE!!!! The Language is unnecessary and especially the crude humor!! No doubt about it. Despite the fact that I'm a very big fan of the face of comedy -Jim Carrey. I just think that this just wasn't his best film. And when looking at the personal quotes of one of the Farley brothers he actually said that he thinks this was their worst film. But, he said it was because the storyline was bad. I could not agree more.","Me, Myself & Irene"
172,Pebble-2,"Hit and Miss, but Definitely Different!",7,27 September 2001,"I enjoyed this film, although some of the humour flew straight past me.  The thing is that this film does not play safe (something which you could say of Jim Carrey also) and many of the gags completely miss the mark.  A lot of the humour is quite shocking, but even some of that still made me laugh!Sometimes it seemed that it was trying to be deliberately politically incorrect, but at the risk of sounding like a pseud I think some of it was actually quite challenging.  The three fast-talking, street wise, budding nuclear physicist, linguist boyz from the hood sons were a stroke of comic genius.  But the chicken and the cow scenes just seemed gratuitously pointless.Still, I'd rather a film be daring and miss half the time than be safe and just consistently unfunny.  7/10.","Me, Myself & Irene"
173,Eagles409,Very Funny,7,26 June 2000,"I'm so glad Jim Carrey is back doing his comedy.  I enjoyed The Truman Show, but nothing is a substitute for Jim doing slapstick.  This movie brings it all back.  If you liked the movies dumb and dumber and King Pin you'll love this movie.  If you didn't like those movies don't bother seeing this.  It is definetley a Farrelly brothers movie.  I highly recommend it.  I think Jim Carrey was made for this part.  One of the funniest movies I've seen.","Me, Myself & Irene"

176,doug_burton,Spends too much time on the low road,4,3 September 2000,"I really had high hopes for this movie, because I greatly enjoyed ""Something About Mary"" and I more often than not like Jim Carrey, and of course Renee Zellweger is wonderful.  But this movie spent far too much time taking the low road, with really crude sexual humor (even more so than ""Something about Mary""), and racist stereotypes.  Some parts of it were funny, but overall it was very disappointing.  And don't make the mistake of taking preteens to see this movie -- I saw several families at the matinee showing with 10 and 12 year-old kids, and I have to say I was embarrassed by the crude humor in this movie (the little girl in front of me was giggling at the dildo jokes -- I bet her mother had a lot of explaining to do about that one!)Rating: 4 out of 10, only because Renee Zellweger is in it, and the closing credits are pretty cute.","Me, Myself & Irene"
177,X2Nightcrawler,Really funny with some gross parts,7,13 July 2001,"I have the movie on DVD and it rocks!  I'm a big Jim Carrey fan and this was deffinately better than the movie before ""Man On The Moon"".  Well in the movie, you see a dildo and Hank Evans (Jim Carrey)'s penis grow.  Plus in the deleted scences, there's a couple parts about him screwing a watermelon. Not good for youngsters, but is kind of funny.  Plus on the DVD is a music video of Foo Fighters ""Breakout"" which is awesome and funny.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is not offended by adult humor.","Me, Myself & Irene"
178,Ramalama_FFF,Worst Carrey movie ever,5,19 January 2006,"It's fairly entertaining... If you're bored as hell that is, but just don't get your hopes if you're planning to watch it.I don't even know where to begin about the problems. First of all the plot is pretty stupid, the villains are completely uninteresting; it's as if they were just thrown there as an excuse for creating the journey of Carrey and Zellweger in the movie. So, it's hard to take them seriously.And that's just one of many clichés, stuff worn out by earlier Farrelly-movies. One other is the three black sons of Carrey. ""Haha, they're so ghetto!"", is that supposed to be funny? It's so stupid that you're not even thinking about the more serious issue of racism, on a broader level that is.Oh and the whole schizo thing is also a not-so-funny thing that still makes the whole movie. To have almost serious scenes concerned with the two different personas as if they really were two different persons, 'causing all the drama in the relationship with Irene (Zellweger), is so wrong. Has the theme of schizophrenia ever been handled in a more generic way in movies? I don't think so. In the latter part of the movie when this 'causes Carrey to have a physical battle with himself, it just becomes too much. It goes on for about 10 minutes and you're just waiting for the movie to end.And people criticized the Cable Guy! sigh...","Me, Myself & Irene"
179,iqjumpuw,Funny as hell,9,2 May 2001,"I couldn't stop laughing watching this movie.  I thought it was one of Jim Carry's funniest movie of all time.Don't get fooled by other people who say it's just plain stupid.  They obviously don't appreciate these kind of jokes and take it too seriously. People watch these kind of movies for fun.  They have good time.  When you watch movies like Dumb & Dumber, There's something about Mary, etc... What do you expect?  You know the movie is going to be stupid before you even see the movie.  It's about how much it makes you laugh.  Now I don't know about other people, but this movie made me laugh so much my stomach was hurting. :-DWell... I hope you guys enjoy it too!  9 out of 10","Me, Myself & Irene"
180,davew-5,Trash.,2,30 July 2000,"If you found ""There's Something About Mary"" too intellectually demanding and politically correct, this is the film for you. Not only is it spectacularly unfunny, it manages to pander to every kind of stereotype imaginable.","Me, Myself & Irene"
181,rob_fearnside,Entertaining but not one for the kids,4,20 January 2002,"The plot had potential but did not seem to fully develop as it was very predictable. Carrey as usual, did his best to make it work. Hate the swearing used by Charlies son's, it was totally inappropriate and spoilt the movie as far as family viewing was concerned. Swearing is OK if suited to the movie. It didn't suit this movie. I fail to understand why so many good potential 'family' movies are polluted with foul-mouthed and minded scripts. The dildo and reference to anal intercourse were likewise inappropriate to script development. Disappointing, as it had lots of potential. The fight scene between Charlie and Hank was very much like the ending of 'Fight Club', which did the whole concept of duel personalities in a much more entertaining and thrilling way. Watch 'Fight Club',to the end, after this movie and you make the decision.","Me, Myself & Irene"
182,Moviemanic22,Jim Carrey's finest movie,6,26 May 2016,"'Me myself and Irene' is directed by the Farrely Brothers, who previously were behind films like the hilarious 'Kingpin', Dumb and dumber and the recent 'Hall Pass' They require no introduction and many people are aware of the tone of their films. They have the ability to provoke laughter by using sex themes, disabilities and crude behaviour. Many people could mistake them for the 'scary movie' directors. This film is no exception. This is Jim Carrey's second film with the director duo. And he has pushed the boundaries of uncanny studiedness to the furtherest limits. The plot revolves around cop who has to escort a hit and run witness, played by Renee Zellweger to New York as the authorities are after her. Her ex boyfriend gangster is also chasing her as he was who she witnessed behind the incident. The story is nothing special and unique, but this scenario gives the lead actors the opportunity to interact with each other to their fullest potential. Zellweger and Carrey share good screen space and their chemistry works wonders on the screen. I would rate this as one of the Farrelly brother's best movies. However I would state that this is not exactly intelligent comedy but more in the slapstick vain.","Me, Myself & Irene"
183,KirstenJackson,Ha! I Just Kept On Laughing!,8,29 April 2005,"How can I sum up this movie in one word? HILARIOUS! Jim Carrey puts on an outstanding, comical performance as Charlie Baileygates, a guy who everyone knows is real lenient and never sticks up for himself, he just won't say no, even when he wants to. He develops a split personality, and the other personality is Hank Evans, a guy with a foul attitude. Charlie must protect, Irene Waters (Zellweger) from her corrupt ex-boyfriend, who is out to hurt her. You'll crack up when Charlie suddenly becomes Hank at the worst times and his antics are completely outrageous! There is a lot of language and crude humor in this movie, so you may want to take precautions with younger viewers, but it is definitely one of the most comical films I have seen in a while.","Me, Myself & Irene"
184,wolfdog,I like this film.,8,16 October 2001,"I have read many reviews both good and bad about this film and of course there are those who hate and those who love it. I lean towards those who love it. I do think some of the potty jokes went a bit too far but other than that it was truly a funny film with a GREAT sound track! Pete Yorn is great and probably most who did not like this film have never heard of him. One shining quality that comes out in Carrey's character even though he is a mental case it that he never considered letting go of what was most important to him, his kids. Not that this would be a good movie for kids but no matter what he did the right thing unless he was Hank. Carrey played the square dad perfectly and the kids while a bit over the top were portrayed brilliantly by the actors. Why do so many people have trouble laughing? Maybe they should have a drink with Hank and spend a night in a motel with him.","Me, Myself & Irene"
185,fairygirl411,fairly innocuous but not much fun,5,28 June 2002,"I've heard Jim Carrey's performance in this movie described as ""semi-straight.""  Pardon me, but it's anything but.  The movie's harmless by all counts -- a minimum of crude humour, cute story.  But it's nothing more than an excuse for Jim Carrey to show off, once again.  There is nothing moving or even accurate about the character of Charlie/Hank.  And frankly, I didn't even find the film funny (it IS supposed to be a comedy).  The gags are getting old.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Officer Charlie Baileygates is about as interesting as split-pea soup without the ham. Hank Evans is a VERY THINLY DISGUISED Fire Marshall Bill.The movie does have a few good moments but these are marred by the overwhelming number of shock-value moments.  Renée Zellweger as Irene P.

188,jimdugger,"Me, Myself, and Irenelly liked it!",10,9 August 2001,"This movie shows a lot of character. To me it is an instant classic! I feel the same for the movie as much as I liked viewing the ""Wizard of Oz""! This movie has a little of everything: comedy, romance, adventure. This movie doesn't overflow with mushy stuff, nor does it have a complicated plot; yet it has a unique (shall I say ""corny""?) sense of humor that you expect out of Jim Carrey that makes the movie such a pleasure to watch. The movie seems to flow so elegantly it's like viewing ""poetry in motion"". Now I understand some people just don't like these type of movies. These are the types of people who are never satisfied. I have read comments before that say how awful a movie was and they were never entertained or got their money worth! I wish people would just come to a movie with an open mind, sit down, relax, and just take it for what it's worth. I know it is bothersome to most if something happens during a movie that doesn't make sense or brings up some negativity from what is happening in your own life and can prohibit enjoyment of a movie. For example, in the movie, Jim gets dumped by his ""soulmate"" for another guy - a black midget! To some, that may be bothersome. I say just watch the movie because THAT makes the movie so funny! Also, there is some sexual inuendo (did I spell that right?) said that may offend some people but that's just Jim working his magic! I find that mostly guys like this movie. But I have seen women watch this movie and howl with laughter! I own the DVD of this movie and I love watching it over and over. The scenery is sooo beautiful that it makes me want to visit the place, and some of the things Jim does and says is outright hilarious! I do not want to give much away so I'll put it like this: If you liked Dumb & Dumber, then you should like this movie because it has the same type of humor, just a whole different plot.","Me, Myself & Irene"

The Farrely Brothers direction and the straight acting by Rene Zellwegger and Robert Forster play off Carrey's impeccable comedic timing and sight gags extremely well. Highlights include Carrey's easy going ""Charlie"" character trying to avoid becoming his inner schizoid ""Hank"" at the least little provocation, like in the store check-out line....a classic scene that ends up with ""Hank"" sucking a new mom's nipple...or at the DMV where Charlie takes his meds, which causes the funniest dry-mouth scene ever put on celluloid. Many scenes involving the dual personalities are laugh out loud funny...see this on DVD today! Oh yeah, Charlie's 3 sons are black (you'll find out why..) with IQ's over 200 and extremely funny, too!","Me, Myself & Irene"
190,shivermetimbers15,My favorite Farrelly Brothers film.,9,21 September 2002,"Me, Myself, & Irene is my favorite Farrelly brothers movie to date. It's just SO damn funny at points, and it maintains an odd sort of sweetness. Both of Carrey's characters are hilarious in their own right, and this film is the best example yet of his comic talent. This is definitely Jim Carrey's movie, and like all Jim Carrey movies, it's about him acting fairly weird in a world that doesn't know what to make of him. Renee Zellwegger plays her character with plenty of attitude, and it's nice to see how she is so able to stand up to Hank, yet is really submissive with Charlie.The biggest scene-stealers in history have to be Jim Carrey's three sons, who happen to be black (it's explained at the beginning). All three are geniuses, brought up by a single, white father in a small town in Rhode Island, yet they speak like they've been living in a ghetto all their lives, sprouting profanities all around. They're really a sidelight to the movie, the only other part that's intentionally funny. The sweetness I'm talking about comes from Charlie, and the soundtrack. Boy, does the soundtrack rock. It's full of great music. It's what makes this film more than just a Jim Carrey vehicle, it really allows the viewer to get a look at the characters. It's hard to believe, but this film actually does have a message, which interrupts the comedy enough to make the movie into an actual story.But what the heck. It's funny.

This movie had such potential (a great cast and a great premise) and threw it all out the window to become nothing more than a wasted 2 hours.  The script just did not deliver.  Renee Zellwegger was reduced to little more than a pouty-face (which she does well, but is capable of so much more) and Jim Carrey's character Hank/Clint Eastwood impression was flat-out boring.  With the Farrelly Brothers track record, I would have expected to be rolling in the aisle.  Instead, all I ended up with was a bemused nose-whistle chuckle.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Thus Jim Carey's character's three black sons (adoptive - but that's a plot point of no particular importance) may be wicked smart with Mensa smart parents, but that is of no moment.  Despite being raised by  straight arrow nice guy and despite having all the brains in the world, these guys get tattoos or stuff themselves to obesity, use 'f***ing' as an article in speech and in general, their exchanges are ghettoese trash talking.  The premise is you can take a nigger [to use the language of the movie] out of the 'hood, give him all the brains in the world, but he's still a nigger.  This stuff is supposed to be funny.

I also got so sad when I discover that the average is 6.0 (the samenumber that many other real films, like Vertical Limit, for example.Jim Carey was great at MASK, and that was the first movie withhim I saw.

I was wrong. Food poisoning was much funnier than this movie. It wasn't just my reaction alone. To see a laughter craving audience from the heartland of America sit in stunned bewilderment, while embryonic giggles faded into nothingness is not a pretty sight. Nor was this mean spirited movie, which poked fun at everything from interracial offspring, little people, and ghetto speak. I think I may have laughed once, during a scene involving a funeral, but that might just have been my fever returning. Finally I couldn't take it any longer and walked out, sorry that I hadn't opted to see ""Chicken Run"" instead. The real puzzle is why such a gifted actor and comedic genius like Carrey would waste his energies on such a turkey. Can it be that comedy is so unpredictable that nobody saw this disaster waiting to offend mass audiences? I think it's more simple than that: Carrey's name sells tickets. And that's no joke, either.","Me, Myself & Irene"

A COMEDIC CLASSIC.,10,29 June 2000,"Okay, lets get something straight, this is no Oscar contender or something like that, this is a movie that your not suppose to take seriousely.  The point of a comedy is to make people laugh,and this movie does that just as well as any other comedy classic.  I'm sick and tired of people knocking comedies like this because it doesn't have an award winning plot or whatever. I went to this movie to laugh and see Jim Carrey.  I was not dissapointed in any way, because i laughed my ass off. I have read a lot of the reviews about this movie, both from critics and from user comments, and i have to say that i am dissapointed in their view of the film. If you have a problem with the type of humer that this movie has, that's one thing, but to knock the movie because it lacks a great plot is stupid. To tell you the truth, i am glad that this movie didnt have a complex plot, because i dont want to have to think and figure things out when i go see a comedy.  I hope that people stop picking on movies like this and just accept them for what they are worth, and that is grade A comedy. ****","Me, Myself & Irene"
200,WCBrown,Don't bother,1,9 July 2000,"I like Carrey and most of the movies he's been in.  But this one just flat out sucks.  I can handle foul language and sexual innuendo, most of the movies I watch are R-rated or PG-13.  But when I'm constantly being beaten over the head with it to the point of distraction then it's not fun anymore. The racial and gender stereotypes were inappropriate, embarrassing and completely out of context.  We walked out after 45 minutes but got a credit for another movie anyway.  Oh well.","Me, Myself & Irene"
201,DeweyQ,Laughing in spite of myself,8,19 June 2001,"The visual jokes are juvenile and usually designed to gross out the audience.  Some of them made me feel so squeamish, it was difficult to tell if I was laughing at the image or my own reaction to it.All in all, the movie was entertaining enough that I could live through the occasional queasy feelings and cheer for the unlikely hero -- or heroes depending on how you look at it.  Jim Carrey is simply unmatched in this kind of over-the-top role.The Farrelly Brothers have made an art form out of gross-out flicks, but this one is somewhat inferior to their comedy classic, There's Something About Mary.","Me, Myself & Irene"
202,han solo-4,The gross out comedy continues...,6,9 October 2000,"Jim Carrey returns to the Farrelly Brothers fold after appearing in their Dumb and Dumber.  Between that one and this one, the Farrellys grossed us out with There's Something About Mary.""Irene"" is not as good as the two mentioned above.  It has its moments of gross out comedy that Peter and Bobby Farrelly have made their trademarks. Such as Carrey trying to put a cow out of its misery, Carrey getting his own back on his neighbour who has let his dog foul Carrey's garden and Rene Zellweger telling Carrey's good guy character, Charlie, how she and Carrey's bad guy character, Hank, used a dildo the night before.Let me explain, in case you've been on Mars recently, Me, Myself and Irene is about a Rhode Island cop, Charlie Baileygates, who creates a mean alter ego, Hank, to help him cope with confrontation.  Unless Charlie keeps taking his pills, his split personality comes into play!Its going to get to a point soon where the Farrelly Brothers will have no more taboo subjects to confront head on - what will they do then?","Me, Myself & Irene"
203,JHW3,"Me, Myself & I think this movie stinks!",3,9 July 2000,"The Farrelly brothers have finally done it--they have managed to make a thoroughly boring and thoroughly disgusting movie.  While Dumb & Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary were disgusting, they were hilariously disgusting.  This movie is just plain unfunny disgusting.  There seems to be a general fixation in this movie on the anus and the use of the anus as a bodily opening into which animate and inanimate objects are rammed.  I didn't like the story.  I didn't like the anal humor.  I didn't like the characters (and, other than Jim Carrey, I don't know whether I even liked most of the actors who played the characters).  I didn't like the narration (reminded me of The Big Lebowski, another truly bad movie).  And I didn't like the soundtrack, except for maybe one song.  I should have listened to Rita Sever of NBC's Friday Night who rated the movie ""only if you're desperate [to see a movie]"".  She's usually right on the money with her reviews, but I like Jim Carrey and most of his movies, so I thought I'd check it out.  All in all, this movie was a disappointing waste of time and $8.50.  It wouldn't even be worth seeing for $1.95 at the local second-run movie house.","Me, Myself & Irene"
204,reichjon,it wasn't as bad as some of you give it credit for,8,26 June 2000,"This movie was not bad at all.  As a matter of fact, I enjoyed it a lot. Although many of the jokes were disgusting, they made me laugh almost every time.  The characters who play Jim Carrey's sons were hilarious.I don't want to give any away spoilers, but it really is a funny movie.It may not be the best Farrely Brothers movie, (Kingpin still may be my personal favorite), but it is still a worthy effort.In my opinion every Farrely Brother's film has some dry moments to it, but the prize of extreme laughter always make these films worth the money.I'll give it a 15 out of 20.","Me, Myself & Irene"
205,mark-460,Avoid this movie at all costs.,1,26 February 2001,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made.  The producer and director must have tried to ""shoot the moon"" and offend just about everyone ~ and on that score, they can count their only success.  There are no highlights at all.  Every actor in it and the writers can safely be tarred with the same brush.","Me, Myself & Irene"
206,Jackie_Treehorn,"Not your normal Jim Carrey movie, but still good.",7,24 June 2000,"The amount of crude sexual humor in this movie wasn't very characteristic of other Carrey movies. I guess that kind of humor is synonymous w/ any Farrely Bros. movie.  I still thought the movie was very good and Carrey should at least get nominated for best actor for the talent that he has to carry on a conversation w/ himself.  He played the 2 parts outstandingly.  The story unfolds and develops well and keeps you entertained the whole time.  Me, myself, and Irene is a quality comedy if you don't mind a lot of strong language and its worth the price of admission.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I really can't understand why the hell I ever went to see this movie: I saw the story (if you can call it a story) in the trailer, I've seen the jokes in all other Jim Carrey films and I surely didn't go for the acting. Anyway, this is just another stinker comedy that doesn't deserve your attention and I'm not gonna wast any more comments on it. 3/10","Me, Myself & Irene"

209,jayhonk,fundamentally a bad movie,2,24 November 2001,"A comedy that is not funny.  In any movie you should empathize with one of the characters. Not so here. The split personality of the Jim Carrey character is not sympathetic.  Actually the bad character is more fun.  The stupid gross humor (attempts) that others mentioned in these reviews did not actually put me off.  But they were not very funny. In summary, the plot was stupid, the characters annoying, jokes not funny, nothing good here... Move along, people, nothing to see here.","Me, Myself & Irene"

211,elainew32,Jim Carrey was incredible when his two characters fought with each other in the one body!,4,5 June 2003,"Now you realize before you ever watch a movie like this that you will have to suspend belief in a few things, including definitions of ""split personality"" and ""schizophrenia"", so that aside, this is a pleasant comedy that looks at what could happen to a very nice man who never has the courage to stand up for himself, and is always a Mr. Milktoast (even though he is a State Patrolman).  The suppressed anger and rage build up in him until one day they errupt, and his rage side comes out whenever he sees something happen that he feels should be corrected, while the person doing it just flaunts it in his face. It turns into a crazy adventure story, in which his two sides alternately come out, and both of them try to win Renee Zellweger's character, as they try to outrun crooked law enforcement agents.  It was an enjoyable zany movie, but the absolute standout scenes in the movie involved Jim Carrey's performance, as his two sides decide to have it out with each other, but all while occupying the same body.  Carrey is known for being a tremendously physical comedic actor, but this is beyond extreme ultra!  I have frank admiration for what he pulled off, and it has to be seen to be believed.","Me, Myself & Irene"

213,pfitz,lost its' way,6,26 June 2000,"This movie had some big laughs (10 or so), which is a lot more than you can say about some other ""comedies"" lately.  It also had a low ""missed laughs"" count (perhaps 3).The plot, on the other hand, missed entirely.  I still don't understand the whole EPA/golf course/must-kill-the-girl plot -- it was never properly explained.The three kids violate a policeman, steal a helicopter, (and mysteriously appear at the needed time with no way of knowing where they were needed) -- and get off scott-free.The whole albino subplot didn't pay off at all.This film was too ambitious.  If they made the plot simpler, but kept the same gags, I would have liked it a lot more, I suspect.  ""Dumb and Dumber"" had the right sort of simple plot, but didn't have as many big laughs.The whole dildo thing means I have to make sure my parents don't see the movie.  One or two big ""shocks"" is ok (like the ""hair gell"" in Something About Mary), any more than that approaches vulgarity.","Me, Myself & Irene"
214,Harry-115,A truly AWFUL movie,1,24 August 2002,"Most of the Farrelly brothers movies are as offensive as they are juvenile, but at least they manage to generate some genuine belly laughs. This movie, however, was un-funny and just plain awful.Jim Carrey mugs it up as usual, but in the context of this poorly written, poorly directed mess, he's just not funny. Poor Renee Zellweger is totally wasted on this train wreck. How EMBARASSING!This movie confirms for me that I could never work in a video store. If I saw someone about to rent this garbage, I would have to say something. Rent ANYTHING else... quick.","Me, Myself & Irene"
215,hgni,Not up to par with other Farrelly bros. films,5,8 July 2000,"The movie's filled with great gags, but overall is a bit more shallow than other Farrelly bros. movies. The three kids are perhaps the gem of the film, geniuses with profanity-laced dialogue patterned after Richard Pryor standup routines -- as well as Carrey's routine when the two personalities are battling it out with each other. However, none of the characters are developed beyond a stick figure personality and the Dukes of Hazzard-esque narration is annoying. Carrey overall sleepwalks through the two roles.","Me, Myself & Irene"
216,Mr. Tobar,"Lacking, with a few moments of decency",5,9 October 2000,"I'd say that overall, this movie was terrible.  There were a couple of small parts in it that really made me lose my composure, quite pleasantly, but there were also long stretches where I found myself looking around the theater.  That's never a good sign.  Most decent movies I see, I don't even realize I'm IN a movie theater, from the beginning credits to the end of the movie.  I rate this one as a mediocre video rental.  Luckily, I saw it at the dollar theater.This movie did not allow itself to be held back or impeded by politically correct studio people who were afraid of the audience's possible reaction, which is always laudable; but I did not find most of the shock gags to be that great.  It was a case of some shock humor attempts that just weren't that funny.  Maybe I'm just not easily shocked.","Me, Myself & Irene"
217,millzyluke,Always one of my favourite comedies.,10,4 July 2020,"I first watched this when I was about 11 and I didn't have many other 15 rated VHS's back then, apart from other Jim Carrey comedies so this was like the naughtiest movie I owned apart from Little Britain's first series. I know it didn't exactly garner glowing reviews but I don't care about what people like Roger Ebert and others say because they don't speak for us normal people viewers and I think anyone with a good sense of humour and/or anyone who considers themselves true fans of the incredible, once in a millennium comedic genius, Jim Carrey is inevitably going to end up with aching cheek muscles by the end of this film. It's not one of his absolute best films but it's still funny and it never fails to make me laugh, and that matters especially so in a time like this with the world being such a doomy gloomy and dark place right now!
Do I recommend this film to anyone who wanted to read other people's reviews before watching the film and is currently reading this part of the review I am about to post? Absolutely! Will you be disappointed? Absolutely not! Are there better comedies out there? Absolutely! Would I have given this film such a positive review as I have here if Charlie Baileygates had been portrayed by anyone other than Jim Carrey? Absolutely not!","Me, Myself & Irene"

219,levendis,"Carrey is Great, the Laughs Aren't",7,10 April 2001,"Let me preface this by stating that I am not a Jim Carrey fan. Usually, Seeing a Jim Carrey movie on the shelves of my local video store is a sign that I'm in the wrong section. If a friend invites me over for a Jim Carrey film, it's oddly enough the same night I'm washing my hair. I continually suggest that people who watch his films are evolutionary throwbacks.But, y'know, I think I may actually be becoming a Jim Carrey fan. I enjoyed him a lot in _The Truman Show_, and I really, *really* liked him in _Man on the Moon_. And I liked him in this film. The guy actually has a lot of talent -- that is, when he's not talking out his rear end.Baileygates, the character Carrey plays in this film, is fleshed out well, and Carrey plays him with enough realism and affability that you soon become sucked into the story. His alter ego, Hank, is insanely over-the-top -- but he's supposed to be. And even at that, Hank is also very likeable. Carrey turns in a great performance in this movie, and he should be recognized for it.As far as the rest of the film... well, the Farrelly brothers are not the Zuckers, nor are they the Coens. They are not envelope-pushing provocateurs; instead, their humour is that of two high-school teens, giving each other noogies and purple nurples in their parents' basement. That being said, there are some genuine laughs in this movie: the limo driver, Hank in his fighting stance, the drum riffs, taking his newspaper back. Still, the Farrellys have not impressed me -- I might change my opinion if they ever go an entire film without ""hair gel"" or a chicken in a someone's butt.I gave this movie 7 repressed emotions out of 10, meaning that Carrey's performance makes it worth your rental money, even with the cheap laughs. And if you're still a fan of the purple nurple, you might enjoy this film a whole lot more.","Me, Myself & Irene"
220,Jack-15,"Basically a funny movie, but too gross!",7,22 November 2001,"This is basically a funny movie, with some very hilarious moments.  Jim Carey is again outstanding, in his usual perverse way, and Renee is terrific.  The movie goes over the line, and would have been better if the foul language, crude sexual references, and simply gross scenes were toned down.  I don't want to sound like a prude, but this pushed the limits of decency and it doesn't speak well for where our society is going if this is the type of humor people truly want to see. Keep your children away from this one (and Grandma and Grandpa too).","Me, Myself & Irene"

Most of the time we watched in fascination as to how downright awful this movie was. We couldn't figure out how the makers of one of our favorite movies ""Something about Mary"" could follow up with such an unfunny movie. Our jaws were agape at the poor joke setup, sloppy editing, and the incomprehinsible plot line.Stinker!!Sincerely, johnmoss","Me, Myself & Irene"
222,dlcasey,Definitely a Farrelly!,7,23 January 2001,"Jim Carrey is a sweet nerdy highway patrolman whose wife leaves him for a 3 foot tall African-American MENSA-member limo driver...probably you can guess the rest?  Well, maybe not guess, but you get the idea.Essentially he represses this trauma and quietly raises his 3 black children (who turn out to be trash-mouthed 400 pound black geniuses) and is stepped on by everyone in his quiet Rhode Island burg...until he snaps one day and his ""multiple personality disorder"" comes out--his alter ego being a mean-spirited sex-crazed psychopath named Hank. He runs across Irene (Zellweger) who is in trouble and is targeted by the ?mob and a corrupt police force, and he somehow becomes her protagonist. However, Hank is deviously trying to get her into bed (which he eventually does sneakily).  After all is said and done, Hank is suppressed and the sweet loveable Carrey character overcomes the bad guys and wins the girl with the aid of his Sugarhill Gang children.  Typical Farrelly jokes and ploys.  Most enjoyable for those like myself who enjoy this, but perhaps a bit more schtick than many will like (like the cutaway from the defecation in the neighbor's yard as a reprisal for the doggy-doo to the dispensation of the chocolate frozen yogurt--get my drift?)Anyhow, I think it well worth a rental, but am glad I didn't pay the big theater money for this one.  Zellweger is delicious without having to show any nudity.  An outlandish character ""Whitey"" (his real name is Casper--an albino fellow) is hilarious).Hope you enjoy!dlc","Me, Myself & Irene"
223,Phalanx-6,Completely worthless,4,5 July 2000,"This movie seemed to fill it's void of amusing material with shocking content that served more to surprise the audience (and make them all groan at it's over the top nature) than to make them laugh.  I was personally surprised to see Jim Carrey in a movie like this; I just thought that he would take one look at the sceenplay and say ""no way.""  I took my girlfriend to this movie, expecting a nice, funny movie (like the trailers seemed to indicate).  Instead we got an excess of gross humor that seemed to be aimed at out doing American Pie.  There are a few funny parts to the movie, but for the most part it is filled with no-brainer, sick, quick laughs.","Me, Myself & Irene"
224,Sweeney-8,The Curse of the Farrelly Bros.,3,3 August 2000,"The only reason this movie got a 4 from me instead of a 1 or a 2 is because it features Jim Carrey in all his comic brilliance.  Love him or hate him, you've got to admit that this guy is an absolute master of his own body.I have the same beef with this movie as I do with Nutty 2.  Both Carrey and Eddie Murphy are comic geniuses--why on earth do they need to resort to bottom-of-the-barrel humor?!?  That's for hacks like the Farrelly (sp?) Bros. who couldn't come up with real comedy to save their lives (Kingpin *did* have its moments, though).  Liar, Liar was a fantastic film, as was Nutty Professor I.  And how about Murphy in Bowfinger?  Absolute brilliance! Why oh why do we keep paying the Farrelly Bros. and all their imitators to keep churning out these stomach-churning wastes of celluloid?!?  They must have us all under a spell or something.  I didn't know Irene was a Farrelly movie, or I wouldn't have gone to see it.

However I was to be sharply disappointed; there were one or two scenes in the film which had me laughing out loud, but that was all.I was offended by the treatment of black people in the film and the sickening treatment of the albino character. The director/writer tried to nullify this treatment by becoming all serious and Jim's character issued an apology to the albino character, but how can you be serious in a film like this? The afterthought apology just made the whole thing worse.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Having seen it again recently I noticed it's actually really funny. Initial impressions can sometimes be a foggy cloud, especially when it comes to a comedy. For those that didn't enjoy this movie watch it again and you'll be surprised how funny it actually is. Same thing applies with Jim Carrey's other ""flop"" known as ""Cable Guy"". Must be why he's doing dramas and thrillers now, even when he made a decent comedy he got no love. I'm guilty too Jim, we apologize buddy. Please come back when you've forgiven us. In the meantime, it looks like your rocking out some dramatic stuff pretty well so more power to you.","Me, Myself & Irene"
231,MickyBurns,Jim Carrey's best comedy performance. Love it.,10,3 October 2011,"My first sentence has to be, this movie is Jim Carrey at his absolute best. I am a big Carrey fan and love Dumb and Dumber, the Ace Ventura's, Liar Liar, The Mask and more but Me Myself & Irene beats them all hands down. The films about Charlie/Hank who has a split personality and mood swings brought on by allowing people to take advantage of him time and time again. The film just makes me laugh so many times with the phrases Hank says and the faces he pulls. It seems to me that the film doesn't get old neither, even today I can watch it and still be crying at some scenes. There's no point in telling you what happens because that would just spoil the story but I will say that Jim Carrey is pushed to the edge by his wife, friends and work mates until he explodes with hilarious consequences. When he's in the transition from Charlie to Hank, it's sort of like when he puts the mask on in 'The Mask' but its better. The story doesn't slow down and your kept interested by Carrey and Zellweger's on screen chemistry which is why it just keeps moving along at a great pace. I honestly think it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen and it always seems to be the 1st film I think of when someone asks me to recommend a good comedy. Watch it it's worth the time.","Me, Myself & Irene"
232,peloquin11,Hilarious,8,19 June 2000,I thought this movie was hilarious. The Farrelly brothers have once again created an extremely vulgar and funny movie.

But when they expect the same level of seriousness out of a comedy movie and criticize it that way, that's when movies like this get low ratings.This movie is basically a 2 hour-long lesson on why to be yourself, stay true to what you believe and never cease to express how you feel about something. And while it teaches you to do that, it adds its own bits of sillyness as an early 2000s comedy movie starring Jim Carrey.","Me, Myself & Irene"

It begins in Rhode Island (every one of their movies start there), and tells the story of RI Highway Patrolman Charlie (Jim Carrey), just married to the ""prettiest girl in town, Layla.""  They live a happy life, until Layla leaves him with three sons (of her midget lover).  Charlie puts all his anger and sadness deep inside his sub-consciousness, and avoids confrontation with ANYONE.  That's where the story begins...when one day, Charlie cracks. Suddenly, he starts to call himself ""Hank"" and hardly avoids confrontation; in fact, he promotes it.  Charlie is diagnosed with a split personality. He is required to escort Irene (Renee Zellweger), a woman arrested for crimes she claims she didn't commit, back to upstate New York to clear up the mess. From here on, the movie gets funnier and funnier...err...sorry...HYSTERICAL! My highest recommendations.Just a note.  Those of you who don't find ""immature"" humor funny and didn't like ""Something About Mary"" will DEFINITELY not like this movie.--Mimick--","Me, Myself & Irene"
238,Ryan N.,Extremely funny with shoddy storytelling: typical Farrely bros. fare,8,26 June 2000,"I laughed till I cried but I wish that the Farrelys would take the time to work on the other elements of their movies besides just the belly laughs, such as writing interesting villains (see Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, and Me, Myself & Irene to know what I'm talking about).And you'd think when they're making a movie about a mental disorder they could at least get it right.  Charlie didn't have schizophrenia, he had dissociative identity disorder!! Schizo's DO NOT have multiple personalities!  What really confuses me is even those who were protesting the movie were against it's portrayal of schizophrenics.  Doesn't anybody know the difference??Don't get me wrong, the movie was exactly what I was looking for and more. I loved it!  But until the Farrelys can improve the overall quality of their movies, they won't be comparable to great comedic movie makers like the Coen bros. (see Big Lebowski to find out why). overall:  8.5 out of 10","Me, Myself & Irene"
239,dklion,"Gross Jokes Work, but so what?",5,26 June 2000,"I laughed at this movie quite a bit, but the movie left me feeling very very, disappointed.  A step backwards for both Carrey and the Farrelys who have both been better.   What made ""Something About Mary"" so wonderfully entertaining was the combination of gross humour AND characters we really cared about and liked.  The ""Irene"" tries to give us a romance and sympathetic characters, but it is ruined by one of with the lamest, laziest plots ever.  Matt Dillon was a wonderful comic villain in ""Mary"",  here we have the usually good Chris Cooper playing an utterly generic bad guy who seems to have wandered in from an old episode of ""Barnaby Jones"". Rene Zellweger is OK as Irene, but she does not color the tone of the entire film as Cameron Diaz did in ""Mary"".  And Jim Carrey tried hard as our hero, but I felt that Steve martin already gave the definitive ""split-personality"" performance in ""All of Me"".  Sorry, Jim, you have to pick your scripts more carefully.AND WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH THAT NARRATOR??","Me, Myself & Irene"
240,tjchi,Could have been much better,3,4 July 2000,"Let me start off by saying I really liked There's Something About Mary, and I also liked Jim Carrey in all of his movies that I've seen (The Mask, Ace Ventura, Truman Show, Man in the Moon). I won't refrain from watching a movie just because some overprotective parents or idiotic congressmen think it's too violent or has naughty words in it or makes fun of the mentally ill. However, this movie just doesn't do it for me.On paper, the casting of Jim Carrey as a man with split personalities is great - the second coming of Jerry Lewis ought to be perfectly able to play two different characters merely by changing facial expressions. But other than the first time he appears, Jim's crazed alterego Hank isn't over-the-top evil enough to be funny. He gets beat up by everyone and even apologizes for being rude at one point. The main personality, mild-mannered Charlie, is put down by everyone in the beginning, but he could have been put down much more, and in funnier ways. Jim Carrey's final confrontation with himself should have been much funnier, but it wasn't because the characters had not been developed enough. It was basically just more of Carrey beating himself up, and that's just not funny anymore.The weak script shows itself in many other ways. It is never really made clear just what Renee Zellweger is doing in Rhode Island in the first place, or just why two crooked cops from New York are allowed to chase them into Rhode Island. There are many slow points in the movie papered over with loud pop music (I counted something like 34 songs in the soundtrack). Having swearing black genius triplets sounds like it would be funny, but for the most part, it isn't here. The narration, which was obviously meant to be funny in the classic Phil Hartman style, is painfully tedious. All of the Farrellys' previous gross-out comedies - Something about Mary, Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin - were really romantic comedies for guys. This movie fails in that respect.There are plenty of people who would not watch this movie just because of the language and shock value, but on top of that I can add another reason - it's just not very funny. The audience I watched it with obviously expected to laugh - many people were laughing in the beginning, even when there was no apparent joke. However, by the end of the movie everyone seemed to be pretty much sick of the whole thing - very few people laughed during the last twenty minutes or so, especially with the thumb incident, which seemed to cast a pall over the rest of the movie. There are some really funny parts in the middle, but they are isolated gags.","Me, Myself & Irene"
241,mgayoso,The Jim Carrey Show!!!,10,15 February 2001,"After all the comments I read in IMDB for this movie, I noticed that many people killed it and I thought twice about buying the DVD.  I sure am glad that I did because this is one of the best DVD's I have in my collection. The special features itself are worth the $18 bucks. Jim Carrey once again delivers in this crazy, P in your pants comedy. I guess all the imdb users that ripped this movie don't have sense of humor. Jim Carrey puts this movie in his own pocket and takes control from start to finish. If you haven't seen this film don't read the other comments. Just sit back, have a beer and get ready for the Jim Carrey Show!!!","Me, Myself & Irene"
242,philomise-2,"same old, same old, but it's still entertaining",7,26 March 2001,"I heard good and bad things from everyone who had seen this movie.  After viewing it myself, I do have to say that it wasn't by any means a good movie, and on the Farrelly scale, it was hardly even anything new (more Rhode Island comedy with strange people and weird situations with oddly heartwarming portions thrown into the mix).  Nonetheless, I never got bored throughout the film.Maybe this is because Zellweger and Carrey did have a never-before tapped chemistry and both of them, although not really creating totally new characters, can make their roles interesting.  The caper chase romance comedy with two parties (the concerned pursuants and the pursued) is somewhat unoriginal, but I was entertained by the more minor of the major players involved, like Whitey and Charlie's three sons.My huge complaint is the overabundance of narration weaved into the film. I'm used to seeing minstrels in Farrellyland (i.e. the 2 annoying guys with the guitars in ""Mary""), but having an unseen narrator voice over the content every twenty minutes to keep us updated felt unnecessary.  The storybook narrator routine was never explained (we never did find out who he was) and I feel that it came off as annoying and amateur.  Despite that and the fact that the soundtrack was a little too bubblegum ""let's put a song in here because so-and-so paid us so much to do so,"" I really enjoyed it as a pick-me-up-buttercup feel-good venture with a healthy amount of disgusting potty humor!","Me, Myself & Irene"

With these kind of lines this movie makes me crack my ass several times.
If you add this brilliant writing of the Farellys Bros. to the master performance of Jim Carrey, and quite an awesome directing (by the Farrellys as well) with some technical peakings such as the sight of the passengers faces through the windows when Irene looks through Whitey's glass-augmenter to the airplane in the sky, Jim Carrey's ""slow motioned"" spit to the air, on the train station or the heightened shoots of the car on the road from the sky (which makes me wonder: how'd they done it, with a crane or an helicopter?), to the genius editing and the brightness of the rest of the cast. Then you'll get what this film is: a keeper!","Me, Myself & Irene"
246,s_garrad,Uneven picture,4,20 November 2021,"If you watch ""Me, Myself and Irene"" without any expectations, then the movie delivers well enough, because this is certainly no milestone in American movie history. That being said, then this is a fairly average Jim Carrey movie, that have several similarities to ""The Mask"" in ways.The movie itself is entertaining for what it is worth. The storyline is good, consistent and has a good flow to it. And it is the type of movie that requires no brain activity from the audience - so just sit back, switch to autopilot and be mildly amused for about an hour and a half.Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger do have good on screen chemistry and they make the movie work.The characters in the movie were unique and well portrayed on the screen, most of them being eccentric and quite out there. Which worked out nicely, because their oddities and eccentricities were a main driving force to the movie.The jokes in the movie are straight and to the point, and the comedy is often bizarre and semi dark humor. It is a movie that will have you smiling and put you in a good mood, but hardly the type of comedy to have you in tears from laughing so hard.""Me, Myself and Irene"" is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy if you also enjoyed ""Dumb and Dumber"".","Me, Myself & Irene"

After doing a couple of serious movies, which he did well, he has returned to his roots with the Farrelly brothers new outing.

If you aren't really uptight you should like it (or find parts of it funny).  If you have a morally casual approach to life (somewhere left of the mid-right), you should love this film. No point in giving away the story, if you've read the comments this far, you know what the film is about.  I'm recommending it to most of my friends.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Unable to hit new levels of gross-out (American Pie and Scary Movie set new standards) the Farrelly's flounder with a thin story and rely heavily on Carrey's return to his idiotic Ace Ventura days.  As for the triplets, I wonder what they're trying to say by making them hyper-intelligent yet still ignorant and stereotypical.

It can be compared a lot to ""There's Something About Mary"" but is more vulgar, offensive, and gross (It should probably have an R rating).  It does have a lot of good laughs though (it's definately funnier than Mary).  It's too bad the Farelly Brothers haven't been able to come up with good clean jokes instead of cheap laughs.  The plot isn't that great either and this probably won't be one you'll put in your DVD collection.  I'd still give it a 7 out of 10 because once you get past the flaws, it's pretty funny.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I was skeptical at first, not being the biggest Jim Carey fan.  However, I was very surprised.  To hear the detractors, one would think that this was some horrible movie.  It was a great comedy. That's all, it didn't need an elaborate storyline, matching each detail in a seamless form.  The purpose was to entertain, and judging by the comments from viewers, it did just that.  It's truly a shame that outrageous comedies like this get little more than a rememberance from viewers as the years roll on. Remember:  Just because it doesn't get the ""Big Award"" doesn't mean it's a bad movie.  Likewise, the heavy drama that wins all the awards may not be your cup of tea.  But if you want something that will leave stitches in your side, I highly recommend Me, Myself, & Irene!","Me, Myself & Irene"

The Farrelly Brothers love to take decent actors such as Jim Carrey and slap their faces on a movie that's gonna hurt their career, like it's a bitter, twisted joke.Well, as usual we have two (arguably three) lead characters that are irritating and flat. There's no character you really root for or care about. If they all died in the final minutes you'd walk out from the film feeling pretty much the same. The jokes involving the token midget, token sex toy and token semen marks are, I'm sure, lost on all but the most mindless telly addicts.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Is there anyone or anything I've missed.  I challenge anyone who truly sees any beneficial message to this movie.  I am also deeply disappointed in Jim Carey, I have enjoyed many of his films.

I love Jim Carrey--The Ace Ventura movies and Liar, Liar and some of my most-favorite movies of all time, and yet this movie absolutely appalled me to the point that I couldn't sit through it. After 30 minutes, I got a refund and left. The content is awful-it is racial, sexual (to a major EXTREME), and gross. Yup, most Jim Carrey have these things in them, but not NEAR the amount that's in this flick. The storyline is a GREAT premise, but unfortunately, they didn't take it to the extreme. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.","Me, Myself & Irene"
264,badcrc,Same level as Ace Ventura - 5 year old,3,7 July 2000,"In my opinion this movie is on the same level as most of Carrey's movies, such as Ace Ventura 1 & 2 and Cable Guy.  Not very funny and pretty stupid. This movie isn't in the same league as Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber, which were actually funny throughout the movie and can be watched over and over again.  If it wasn't for Carrey's black ""children"" in this movie, it would have been a total waste of time to me.  There were moments that I laughed, most of them being the scenes with his kids, but overall its a bunch of thrown together crap.Several times I just said to myself ""I can't believe they left that scene in the movie.""  Most of the audience seemed to agree with me since only 2 people were belly laughing throughout the movie (you know, the kind of people who laugh at anything that's remotely stupid) and the rest were mostly silent except for the rare chuckle.Thinking about his movies it seems that most of the times I think Carrey was funny is when another character in the movie is reacting to something he did, as opposed to just Carrey running around being a retard.","Me, Myself & Irene"

The relentless flogging of the word motherf***er really started to grate on my nerves.  I've enjoyed all the other Farrelly movies.  I was looking around the theatre while it was on, and didn't see anyone else laughing that much either.  There were a lot of kids (pre-teens) there.

In one scene, when Carrey's character finally ""breaks"", he spies a well endowed woman breastfeeding a baby.  The next thing you know, Carrey has replaced the baby and is breastfeeding himself.  If that wasn't bad enough, after that we see him driving with a milk mustache.  If you think this sort of thing is funny, you'll love this film.  Speaking of not funny, I guess the director thought it would be funny if Carrey's character were the biological father of 3 large black teenagers with crude language, rapper accents, and Einstein IQs.

275,daveairguitar,Disappointing disjointed affair,4,7 June 2001,"Jim Carrey used to be a funny man. Dumb and Dumber was sheer class because he played it toned down (for a change!). Every comedy he's made since then he seems to get more and more over the top. Cable Guy had its moments as did Ace Ventura. Liar Liar was just sheer schmaltzy pap. Which brings us to Me, Myself and Irene. Slated on its realise for its poking fun at Schizophrenia the idea in its self is good and seems suited to Jim's manic brand of humour. Jim plays Charlie a cop with  a problem for letting people walk all over him. One day he blows his top and decides to take out his frustrations on everybody, in his alter ego Hank. This includes the rather unfunny pretend drowning of a little girl in a fountain for skipping on the road and embarrassing a woman in the supermarket for buying vagina cream. Enter the love interest Renee Zellweger who does a moderate job when Carrey's over the top performance doesn't blast her off the screen. The humour is very childish and you end up feeling rather sorry for Jim's victims as you do for him. The plot is non-existent and the whole film feels like a sad empty shell of a vehicle for Jim to gurn through while doing a silly Clint Eastwood impression as his alter ego Hank. A complete basted turkey! Stick with the serious stuff Jim!!!!!","Me, Myself & Irene"

Plus, I wasn't even going to see the movie. I was going to see Titan A.E., only to find that they weren't showing it, and were showing the sneak of Me, Myself, and Irene instead. So I thought, ""Well... I didn't enjoy There's Something About Mary that much, and I ESPECIALLY didn't like Dumb and Dumber..."" But I bought the tickets anyway (there wasn't anything else better to see that I could actually get into, as they had the wrong rating for the film written down). And after a projector getting fried, and the bulb on the projector in the theatre that we had been moved to blowing, the movie started.Now, initially, I was not impressed. The whole thing with him getting in a fight with the midget black guy was very badly done. Instead of coming up with a viable reason for him to get mad at Carrey, all he does is get mad at Carrey asking, ""Do you people take checks?"" The midget just turns the question into a racial slur, and it all goes haywire. And then the horrible cinematography came in.This movie made me laugh folks, plain and simple. A BIG jump over Mary and Dumber in my opinion... Mary and Dumber were just a bunch of dirty jokes and toilet gags rolled into one... And it wasn't very funny... But this movie has so much personality in it (ESPECIALLY in Charlie's kids, but really because of the actors that depict them) that everything jumped out at you so likeable and cool that you couldn't help but laugh.There's really not much to anylize as far as acting goes... It's just a bunch of actors jumping on screen and hamming it up... Although the three black actors who depict Charlie's kids (Anthony Anderson, and I don't know the names of the other two) will go somewhere in comedic roles... They really jumped out at me, and they got the most out of the characters they were depicting. And of course, Zellwegger is a beauty. One of the only leading actresses out there today who actually stands out in my opinion...And I saw a lot of potential in Michael Bowman.  All in all, I liked this film. Not the best comedy to come out this year so far, but it's one of them. I give it a 4 out of 5.","Me, Myself & Irene"
279,timework,Meant to make you laugh...,9,4 July 2000,"I've read some of the other user's comments on this film, and I think that the meaning of comedy has been lost in their reviews. A comedy is meant to make people laugh, that's all. Comedy's aren't graded on their 'message', or their intricate 'plot line'. Comedies are meant to make you laugh.Also, I think you have to take a movie for what's it is...You don't grade 'Young Frankenstien' along side of 'Citizen Kane'. This is a Farrelly brothers film in case people have forgotten they make movies like 'Dumb And Dumber', 'Something About Mary', & 'King Pin'. Movies That make people laugh.This is also a Jim Carrey movie..he makes movies like 'Dumb And Dumber', 'Liar, Liar', and 'The Mask'. Again, movies that make people laugh. So you have to ask yourself when viewing this film, 'Does it make me laugh?' and 'Does it make me laugh a lot?'I think you will find the answer to both these questions to be yes. I've seen this film twice and both times the audience laughed out loud many times throughout the show. If you like Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just don't go looking for a 'social message', or great plot twists. Save that for the Academy Award nominated flicks.Just take it for what it is.","Me, Myself & Irene"
280,thuegli,Worst Jim Carey movie ever,1,30 June 2000,"I thought this movie was a poor attempt at comedy and would not recommend it to anyone under the age of 13.  There is virtually no plot.  There are a few funny parts to it, but as a comedy I expect to be laughing the whole time. This movie bored to me to the point of almost asking for my money back","Me, Myself & Irene"
281,Cochese-7,P**s Funny!,9,22 June 2000,"Once again the Farrelly brothers have created another gross out comedy to match the fantastic, ""There's Something About Mary"". Jim Carrey is brilliant as a Rhode Island State Trooper with a split personality he develops from the departure of his wife to a midget. A heap of great lines and Carrey at his comedic best make this film a must see to any Farrelly brothers fan and anyone out there looking for a good belly laugh.","Me, Myself & Irene"
282,keren-s,what have you done- Jim?,3,26 July 2000,"i haven't heard much about this film. i knew that it is a comedy, and i knew that Jim carrey is the main character there. but, it was enough! i like jim very much, i like his humor, and i think he has proved himself as an actor in his last films. but this film has spoiled all his great resume. it was so awful! first of all, there was no story! i know that it is a comedy, and it is reasonable that once a year, we'll see a funny movie, that we wouldn't think of it after it ends , and without a complicated ideas. well, it was much worse then a funny and ""middle of the week"" film. the story fits 5 years old kids, and the jokes too. second, the love story- which was the main idea, but was so empty, and so un-built! i think that every one in the cinema, didn't understand why she fell in love with him, and why he fell in love with her. the only element which was funny and i liked his idea, was the 3 boys that appear every 10 minutes in the film, and made me stay in my seat after all. although i find the film as a very bad one, i have to say that the music was great, and the songs were picked up with a big attention- another thing that made me stay until the movie will end. i really don't know what made Jim take a place in this film, or how he succeed to create such a boring and ridiculous film.","Me, Myself & Irene"
283,ckkc29,A film you'll find amusing or utterly disgusting,6,21 July 2000,"I didn't think that Me, Myself and Irene was the best of comedies but I think it is still worth watching... there are some bits in the film which are SLIGHTLY over the top but if you can twist your mind to the more juvenile part you might just enjoy it! I personally don't like watching Jim Carrey that much and I haven't seen many of his films but because Renee Zellweger (Irene) is in it I just had to watch it!","Me, Myself & Irene"
284,shaggy_domas,Making Art,9,18 June 2000,"I won't argue that physical humour can be juvenille, but Jim Carrey has found a way to make it an art. When one of his personalities physically picks up the other, I was drop jawed.  Truly a funny film. The Farrely brothers seem to have a sense about them that allows them to know what would be most shockingly funny, and then putting that to screen.","Me, Myself & Irene"
285,JSprat,Great!!,10,26 June 2000,"I went to see the movie for a laugh, not some deep psychological drama, and I wasn't disappointed (guess I need to grow up :-)...I read nothing but poor reviews on this movie from ""experts"", so that means its going to be a hit...","Me, Myself & Irene"
286,Paul De Munter,No good,4,16 July 2000,"I really don't know what this movie is supposed to be: slapstick, comedy, romantic movie, police movie... It has element of all, but none of them seem to be succeeded. The jokes are really stupid, the story is weak and the language is obscene. There is also the missed opportunity to make the difference clear between 'split personality disorder' and 'schizophrenia', which are not the same. One of the first movies that ever made me think of leaving the movie theater right from the beginning. I probably should have done so...","Me, Myself & Irene"
287,joergen.roenn,Disappointing film,3,9 August 2000,"I'm not a Jim Carrey-fan, but I thought this one would be different. I do like Mask though. I think it's disappointing when a movie is supposed to be funny and it isn't. Vulgarity can be fun. Check out John Waters for one that can handle it. I think the start of the film is kind of promising, where you get a sense of the movie taking on a somewhat serious subject in a funny way. But it's mostly downhill from that. I do think the scene with the chauffeur in the beginning is funny, and Jim Carreys three gangsta intellectual sons also has a funny edge. Apart from that I was disappointed. Check out Steve Martins All of me if you want to see an actor who can make split personality hilariously funny.","Me, Myself & Irene"
288,big_duffer,"For fans of Jim Carrey, do not miss this one.",7,20 January 2001,"I believe that the best measurement of a comedy movie is this:  How much did it make me laugh?  This movie succeeded big time in that regard.Although not as cohesive as The Mask or as slick as Liar Liar, the movie still comes through as a vehicle for what Jim Carrey does best, physical humor.  No modern cinema comedian has ever done it better, including Jerry Lewis or Steve Martin.  True, based on its own merits, the movie would have fallen flat without him.  With him the movie is above average comedy.If you want pure art with your comedy, then see The Truman Show, but if your a fan of Jim Carrey, physical comedy and gross out jokes, then this movie is right up your alley.","Me, Myself & Irene"
289,snafu22q,predictable,4,29 June 2001,"performances ok, but storyline sucks...predictable, not particularly funny despite the talent level of the cast - after the movie was about half over, I couldn't wait for it to end.you can do better.","Me, Myself & Irene"
290,capike-1,It's hilarious !,10,12 January 2007,"Funniest movie I have seen in a long time, wish I had seen it much earlier. I thought I had grown tired of Jim Carrey movies. He seemed like the same character in just about every film. True enough, I can still see elements of the same kind of character in this film, but I think the story is a good one. Renee Zellwegger is lovely and sexy. There were so many funny moments in this movie, from when Jim Carrey nurses on the lovely young mother to the very end when the three boys leave us with ""Thank you for watching our **** movie!"" I actually got all of my friends to watch this movie with me because I was so excited about it and it's already almost 7 years old. Who knew? I guess that just goes to show that you can't judge an actor or a movie until you've seen it.","Me, Myself & Irene"
291,Mad-Vixen,This was the worst film ever!!!!,1,4 May 2005,"I was persuaded by my brother-in-law to watch this, and I had very little hope for its quality.Having now watched it, I can honestly say it was the worst film I have EVER seen! I have seen some pretty bad films in the past, but have never seen one that has made me want to kill myself just to escape from it! Unfortunately I was made to watch it from start to finish, and one thing for which I am grateful is that at least I lived to tell the tale.Needless to say, I would not recommend this to anyone, and would warn against anyone with suicidal tendencies watching it.","Me, Myself & Irene"
292,neeemo-757-690091,Great comedy,9,14 June 2021,"A great comedy, before stolen elections, before terrorist attacks, before fake wars based on lies. Before all that.","Me, Myself & Irene"
293,anuox2,"Very, very convincing performance",8,24 February 2006,"People say Jim Carrey is an over-actor.Well, he pretty much overacted in Ace Ventura, but in this movie god, he is GOOD! He played both guys as if he were two people and I almost believed that there were two of Jim Carrey. Both are distinctively different (aside from the physique)! Renee Zellweger was also good, but she didn't give the Cold Mountain performance in this one. This is a light, hilarious comedy and I think that's why it wasn't nominated for any Oscars. But if the storyline is twisted to be a bit heavy and mind-twisting (as all Oscar-winning movies are), I think Carrey would definitely bag the gold statuette for his great acting. Did the critics hate this movie? Who likes those critics anyway?","Me, Myself & Irene"
294,Break,"Well, I _almost_ voted ""2""..",1,12 May 2002,"They spent 51 million dollars making this steaming pile of excrement? To think how many starving children could've been saved with that sum. Hell, I would've paid Jim Carrey and the Fartelly brothers $51000000 myself so they wouldn't create such a horrific thing that in all fairness doesn't even deserve to be called a ""movie"".And just to make something clear.. I'm most definitely *not* against toilet humor. But there's a limit to how much insulting moviegoers' intelligence I can stand. Most of the ""jokes"" are totally forced and pointless, and are the same stuff we've seen for a million times by now. For some reason the ""writers"" (I use the term loosely) seem to think mentioning a dildo and a man's behind 10 times a minute makes a comedy. Sorry, no.The plot - apart from being quite insulting to people suffering from mental disorders - is non-existent at best. The characters are mind-numbingly one-dimensional even for a comedy, and on top of it all Jim Carrey once again gets to showcase his complete lack of talent. The other actors aren't too spectacular either, and Anna Kournikova's cameo is somewhere between sad and embarrassing.But like the subject says, I nearly gave this movie a 2. (Mind you, I've voted for hundreds of films on IMDb and only a few of them have got a 1 so far) The beginning of the movie actually has some funny moments, and I even laughed at a few points which is exceptional for a Jim Carrey movie. Too bad it all goes downhill after the first few minutes.But the fans of this kind of garbage shouldn't worry.. As long as people pay to see it - and looks like they happily will - they'll continue to make them.","Me, Myself & Irene"
295,rainlord,So where's the funny stuff?,3,19 June 2000,"I got to see this movie as a preview, where the tickets were pre-paid (thank god). I must say I expected quite a bit as it's a Farrelly brothers movie (The Big Lebowski, Dumb & Dumber), and Jim Carry must be one of the more expensive actors at the moment, but oh, what a disappointment. The movie is built on toilet humor.. and it's just not funny. Sure, there's some funny lines, and one or two quotes that are fun, but that's it. Seen the trailer? Seen the movie. It's 2 hours (!) of more or less boring movie with jokes we've all seen before in one way or another. Jim's voice when he's supposed to be the bad guy is just annoying, and it's quite obvious how the movie will end. Don't see it.. go see dumb & dumber one more time instead.. 3/10","Me, Myself & Irene"
296,Rodimus-3,What were you expecting? Plot?,8,4 July 2000,"I suspect there are a few too many people out there who failed to realise that when you combine the minds behind There's Something About Mary and the talents of Jim Carrey you are almost inevitably headed towards less-than-subtle humour territory. If you were mad enough to go into this film looking for character or plot, you need your head read.There's no doubt that this movie will only appeal to those who are looking for a commitment-free laugh. But if you are willing to stop treating the film like Shakespeare and just roll with the film as it goes, rest assured you will not leave disappointed. Sure the jokes are at times anywhere from gross to silly, but if you're there to judge the film incessantly there's no way you can enjoy it. Sit back, and don't be afraid to laugh at whatever comes your way.Carrey is superb as the schizo Charlie/Hank character - I think it's a real pity we don't see a little more of his physical performance as the two personalities try to attack each other in the second half of the film. He is a truly gifted physical performer. Zellweger was passable, but as others have said the surprise package really is Charlie's three kids. Their scripts are first-rate.Don't let the critics tell you this is a bad flick - they're trained to write about elements this movie neither has nor needs. Just go in to the theatre with the right expectations and you will enjoy yourself.","Me, Myself & Irene"
297,chewie-17,This movie deserves to be a blockbuster!!!,8,30 June 2000,"This movie cracks me up! I'm glad that he back in his comedy movies! So far, he won two Golden Globes (Truman Show and Man on the Moon) this should be his third. Farelly Brothers are the greatest comic directors of all. There is a scene in the film that is dangerously funny; is when Charlie's sons stick a chicken up the crack of the trooper's ass!!! Plus, the soundtrack is cool! Including, Smash Mouth, the Offsprings, and the Foo Fighters. It's Jekyll & Hyde meet There's Something about Mary. If you're looking for comedy this summer, Me, Myself & Irene is your answer.","Me, Myself & Irene"

300,Toic,Carrey At His Best,8,4 July 2000,"This was a funny movie.  No, there isn't really a plot.  Yes, it was toilet humor.  Yes, there was profanity.  No, don't see it you're offended by these.  I'm glad to see Jim getting back to his comedic roots.  Carrey's physical comedy mixed with the Farrely Brothers is genius.  It's not perfect, it's not a masterpiece, but it's still very funny.  See it with your friends, don't see it with your kids.  Kids, don't see it with your parents.","Me, Myself & Irene"
301,Jim-465,Movie suffers from hebephrenic schizophrenia,8,17 June 2000,"One more movie that is seriously misrepresented by the previews.  Besides the schizophrenic highway patrolman in love with Irene plot, the movie takes on a whole other personality than one would get from the previews.  And while some of the humor was original and hilarious, much of it was just juvenile.  Be prepared for some heavy duty profanity and violence; most of it is gratuitous.","Me, Myself & Irene"

303,supermankalel,Almost a perfect comedy!,9,15 June 2000,"Sneak previews are great things. =) Outside of the Farrelly Brothers' unfortunate penchant to use the 'f' word too often (unlike 'Scarface', where there actually was a point, sorta), this comedy is superb.  Jim Carrey is once again at his manic best = and 'manic' definitely fits his personae...or should I say 'maniac'? :) See it and you'll understand what I mean.  Kept the whole audience laughing at all the intended spots.  Renee Zellweger's acting seems a little on the light side, but it's still passable.  Stick around through the credits...there is something at the end. :)","Me, Myself & Irene"
304,jgarcia-3,Jim Carrey Is THE MAN!,9,5 July 2000,"I have been watching Jim Carrey since his appearance on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Jim is a physical comedian pure and simply put. He was great in his two previous dramas, ""Man on the Moon"" and ""The Truman Show"". But, ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" brings back to the screen Jim's physical humor such as was previously seen in ""Liar,Liar"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""The Mask"". M,M, & I does not go overboard like his Ace Ventura movies of which I didn't really care for. But watching Jim  change characters in a Jekyll and Hyde like manner without the use of computer animation left me in stitches. Kudos to the writers and directors for a great and not rehashed story. I'm seeing it again real soon.If you have a couple of hours for a good bellyaching laugh go see ""Me, Myself, and Irene.""","Me, Myself & Irene"
305,wagnerro,I want to warn everyone away,1,17 June 2000,"This movie is so bad I want to take the time to warn everyone away from wasting their time.  It's a comedy without a single laugh, or at least in the part we saw.  It was so unbearable that my spouse and I walked out after an hour.  This movie is what Wild Wild West was last year.  Jim Carrey is not funny, the situations are lame, the stereotypes awful, the mental illness trivialized, the characters unsympathetic.","Me, Myself & Irene"
306,theryecatcher,You leave your brain at the door,6,3 February 2001,"Another movie with the potential to be good (not great), but lost any form of credibility by turning out a quick, easy and simple production at the expense of accuracy and decency.  On the other side of the coin  (not unlike using another personality), you can leave your brain at the door and take a vacation for a couple of hours (which we all need at some time) by taking in the laughs and ignoring the parts that are supposed to bring laughs, but just don't.

His facial contortions are impressive, his bodily control is very good indeed.The movie worked for me, I came out entertained; it's crass humour was just right, the Farrelly brothers again doing what they do best -- put people in outrageous situations and then make them suffer.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I cannot believe that Jim Carrey agreed to this role if he read the entire script.  The split personality acting is AWESOME, but it cannot save this piece of trash. Should've walked out and asked for a refund. I've heard that many people have.Save your money.  Skip this movie.  The previews made it seem just like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or even ""There's Something About Mary"" but it is so much LOWER than those.  The previews should have stressed how raunchy the film was.

IMHO Jim Carey can be a bit much in some films, but here, he shines. He's over the top to be sure, but in such an artful way...such an intensely talented way...that his greatness as an American comedic actor oozes. He gives quite a show in so many different ways in this one movie. Renée Zellweger is wonderful as well. Her acting is a perfect balance to the zaniness of the film's story line. Her facial expressions throughout the film are subtly perfect and the viewer ought to pay attention to them. The rest of the cast, from Carey's character(s)'s three black sons, to the albino, to the midget and to the criminals and law enforcement agents compliment Jim Carey and Ms. Zellweger without pause.

And another reviewer thinks ""gun nuts"" would find shooting a poor cow six times in the head was funny! Are you insane?? I am a gun person and I was sickened by such a thing being humorous to a Hollywood moron. Some reviewers are more on the fringe than the actors who took the roles in this movie. This supposed comedy movie pushes beyond any limit in foul language, mostly applied to black characters, it has Carrey in his usual over-the -top trashy characterizations, the man simply goes way, way too far, every time, unfortunately in this movie there are too many opportunities for him to do so. The crudity and vulgarity displayed throughout this movie is so far out of bounds it stretches credulity. It is sad our out of touch, sick, Hollywood directors and producers think this sort of garbage has any value, any use to further advance or amuse a reasonable decent person in any category. It insults the sense of dignity and humor of all but the most scummy type of person, the ones who can't visualize anything without crudity, who probably can't say a three word sentence without three vulgar words. A reasonable, decent person is getting hard to find judging by the number of people who rated this cesspool above a one scale. To see Renee Zellweger doing this doesn't say much for her either. Carrey leans toward this type of crap, can't ignore his glee in stuff like this. How desperate can an actor be... washing dishes is honorable, starring in trash like this is not. Too bad it can't be rated zero.","Me, Myself & Irene"

The Soundtrack is amazing, about 96% the acting is great, this is Jim Carrey at his best (in my opinion) The concept is actually very interesting, especially for a comedy film, Charlie and Hank are so different that they create a great contrast, even though they are played by the same guy (Don't worry it's not like Jack And Jill !)I would give this film 8.8 out of 10 if I could but as it is rounded, I give this film an 8","Me, Myself & Irene"

Mostly with his children, who were the only believable humans in the movie.  The Disney fictional animal adventure movie voiceover was a nice touch, but overall the movie was paintastic.  I wanted to blame Jim Carrey for it, at first.  But, he has his charming moments in most of his moronic movies, including this one.  I imagine everyone involved just didn't care and thought anything they did was going to be great because of how their past projects were received.  Midas Touch Syndrome.","Me, Myself & Irene"

So we decided to take the kids to see another funny Jim Carrey movie.  WRONG IDEA! We didn't know what we were in for.  It started out simple (lots of unnecessary profanity and a comment about a sausage being related to black penises).  But we became utterly embarrassed when a large dildo was used repeatedly during the film.  If that one item had been scraped from the script, then I wouldn't feel like such a bad parent for allowing my nine and twelve year old to see this movie.  I could explain a lot to a child, but how do I explain it when my son asks me what she meant by saying ""It was for you""?

There are plenty of funny incidents and I laughed a lot.  Jim Carrey did a great job; It was good to see him in a stupid movie again.  :-)  I felt that the movie was a little bit more abrupt than any of the Farrely Brother's previous movies because it had a tendency to cut and imply what happened, but don't let that stop you from seeing this movie.  I laughed all the way through.  Sure, it's juvenille humor, but if you're into that type of thing go for it.  If you don't like toilet humor and are stuck up, just avoid this movie.

326,Mightydeez,Excellent! You get all the best sides of Jim Carrey in one movie.,10,23 July 2000,"The return of Jim Carrey!  This movie is awesome.  The story falls apart by the end of the movie, very few characters are developed at all, and every other joke relies on references to the butt... and it's still the funniest movie of the year!  Jim interacts with himself in the most amazing ways and you can immediately tell when he's Hank and when he's Charlie.  Only he could pull off this movie.  Most people will probably hate it, just like they did the Cable Guy, but the true Jim fans are in for a treat.  Even if you don't like Carrey, Charlie Bailygates' three boys are reason enough to see Me, Myself & Irene.","Me, Myself & Irene"
327,lisaa-2,Over the top humor,8,25 June 2000,"From potty jokes to potty mouths... Very over the top, but you can't help but laugh!  Carrey's slapstick humor is up to his par.  I think his triplet ""Mensa"" sons were a hoot!  Renee Zellweger's part was kind of weak, but served it's purpose.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes silly, sick humor and belly laughs...","Me, Myself & Irene"

If you liked Dumb and Dumber and There's Something about Mary, then you will be on the ground laughing at this.  Jim Carrey goes back to the comedic style that made him famous.  If you want to see Jim Carrey as funny as he has ever been , then go see this movie.  This movie is rated R, so expect it to be more perverted than his other movies","Me, Myself & Irene"
329,seanjs-2,Shock value at the expense of content,1,7 June 2000,"What starts out as an interesting story about a man who's afraid of confrontation is completely lost in the juvenile, sensationalist attempt at comedy.  It is shock value at the expense of content, which makes for a very forgettable film.  If you're a six year old and find the ""chicken-up-the-rear"" jokes funny, perhaps you'll be entertained.  But for the rest of the world, please, grow up.","Me, Myself & Irene"

For the first time ever I started to ""dose off"" in the theater.  I have loved all of Jim Carreys other movies, so my expectation was perhaps a little skewed.  Ren'ee Zellweger was the attraction here. Could have left out the ""chicken"" scene and the swearing was way out of hand. If you get a chance to see it, it has a few laughs, but don't cancel any important plans and rush to the theater for this one.","Me, Myself & Irene"

This is the most hillious movie that Jim Carrey has ever done. The scenes involving the black boys, the cow, and the chicken and the cop are the funneist scenes of the summer, you never seen anything like this. So go and see this movie, it's really good and very funny!","Me, Myself & Irene"

For once here's a comedy that can't be bothered to be politically correct and doesn't really care who you are be it human or animal. Everyone seems to be getting it in this crazy comedy featuring a brilliant Jim Carrey. So be prepared at least a couple of times to laugh at yourself, and the rest of the time just sit back and laugh at all the others. The humour is NOT subtle and intellectual one and if you are easily offended, don't go and see it. If you think a fart is funny though, you will laugh for two consecutive hours.","Me, Myself & Irene"

337,poindexter,Rental at best,3,18 June 2000,"Jim Carrey's done some funny things, but this was relatively weak save for one or two shock jokes, and not a lot of effort was put into making the film. Save it for a rental at best. There's nothing you're missing here.","Me, Myself & Irene"

(10+)","Me, Myself & Irene"
340,andrea0092,Disappointed and Disgusted,1,26 June 2000,"I went to see this movie and was not only disappointed, but disgusted as well.  I saw the previews and I thought, ""Great, some slapstick with Jim Carey, sounds good.""  What I actually saw was far from what I expected.  I am not usually easily offended, and I can enjoy a movie with a little bit of sexual crudeness as long as the jokes tie into the plot and are somewhat funny.  In this movie, however, the sexual crudeness was extremely overdone. It appeared to me as though the entire movie was just an excuse to make crude jokes.  Jim Carey is a great actor, but he wasted his talents in this movie.  Another thing that appalled me was the number of young children in the audience.  I know that it is common for parents to bring their children to an ""R"" rated movie, which is why this movie should be rated ""NC-17.""","Me, Myself & Irene"
341,jaz_musician,"Immature, yes, but worth it...",10,29 June 2000,"I have never seen a movie that made me laugh this much.  There were about a dozen or so scenes in the movie where the first thought in my head was 'that's so wrong,' but it didn't keep me from joining the rest of the audience in laughing out loud.  It can probably be compared to a live version of South Park, being crude and, in some instances, just plain disgusting.  It's definitely not a movie to see with a parent or anyone you respect.","Me, Myself & Irene"
342,jrg3,Save your money or see something else.,2,30 June 2000,"This movie is overwhelmed by its crass vulgarity. Jim Carrey is his typical, slapstick, stooge (as in The Three Stooges), which is not bad. But, the obscene language and ""chicken in the butt"" and dildo scenes were totally unneeded. The movie plot had potential, but it was buried in indecent language and nasty, borderline pornographic ""jokes.""Save your money. If you want good Jim Carrey, rent ""Liar, Liar.""","Me, Myself & Irene"
343,jrenfro1,One of Jim Carreys Best.,7,8 July 2000,"I felt it went a little over the line on some of the sight gags, (see dog poop) but it was great adult comedy I thought. Jim Carrey is a genius, I like him in this role at least as much as ""Liar, Liar"" and ""Ace Ventura""","Me, Myself & Irene"
344,dmbsoccr41,"Sorry, but the other guy is pretty much wrong",9,14 July 2000,"Not only does Renee Zelwinger's beauty deserve at least 7 stars by itself but the team of Jim Carrey's talent and the Farrely brother's unsurpassed originality makes this movie damn good and well worth the visit. Or visits in my case. The humor at times was incredibly immature, but who wants political satires all the time, anyway? The immaturity was like comparing Chris Rock, Gallagher, or the Simpsons to Howard Stern, who although is hysterical, has nothing clever about him. The Sons were insanely funny, and the Q-tip line knocked me out of my seat.I opened a fortune cookie today and it read ""A good way to stay youthful is to watch movies like Me, myself, and Irene"".Live a little.","Me, Myself & Irene"

Charlie, the all around good guy, and Hank; who took some serious deep digging to unearth fight for one body.This movie ventures carefully beyond the borderline of the mainstream, clean humor. Cussing, violence and crude sexuality hang loose in this movie, but at a balance which keeps you safely laughing in your seat while gasping from unexpected situations. Even if you yawn at the idea of a chicken-up-the-butt joke, this comes into its own given the right situation (and believe me, it is!).Yet another movie that could only be played by Jim Carrey, and quite perfectly so.Recommended viewing. (I would give this movie a 10 had it not been for the Ace Ventura-ish fighting scenes, so 9 it is)","Me, Myself & Irene"

At first I thought perhaps it was an age thing and yet, while the younger crowd did rate the movie higher, noone averaged less than about a 5. I think this movie was far below mediocre, probably Jim Carrey's worst. His co-star looked like she wanted out in a bad way!  There were exactly two moments in the entire film where I was moved to laughter.  For a comedy, that's a pretty poor performance.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I know it isn't the most appropriate movie for a child but this movie was special to my mother for personal reasons. Jim Carrey is at his finest in this movie. It has the perfect balance of humor , drama, action, adventure, and just about a bit of everything. Ontop of all that it hits some serious areas by addressing mental health and personality disorders. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. Also, the soundtrack is really good and touching.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I really pity the fools who had to sit through his pile of dung in the cinemas. Its crude, its lame, the acting is absolutely F-grade. In portraying two personalities, Jim carrey fails miserably. You really have no clue of whats going on and what Carrey is trying to portray? If it were'nt for the trailers, I'd really never know what this movie was about, besides a 10 minute scene of trying to kill a cow and taking a dump on someone else's yard. You have to be really lucky if you did'nt vomit through this movie or even luckier if you never ever saw it in the first place. Pieces of filth like this movie should be banned. If it was'nt bad enough that this movie was so badly made, it is also extremely juvenile, crude and racist. It also dares to throw cuss words out as if it were a marketing point of the movie.How do movies like this get an insane 6/10 when they deserve 1/10?

356,ParaGrafixcc,"Classic Jim Carrey, very funny.",7,31 May 2008,"I really enjoyed this movie and even though some of it was almost slapstick humor it was a funny movie. By the way, I HATE slapstick humor. It's a good movie, and anyone who doesn't like it has no sense of humor. Come on, a dildo in his OWN azz???? And then he finds out he stuck it there himself??? That was funny stuff. Whether you ""admit"" you like raunchy dildo humor, or fart humor, or anything along those lines, you HAVE to laugh when he wakes up and pees all over the wall, and then finds out about the dildo being stuck up his azz. And later when Irene informs him that he stuck it up his OWN azz that was funny as hell too. The ""fight"" scenes by the train, with the ""get yer foot long and a bag of nuts"" was hilariously funny. The ""fight"" scene in the Mustang wasn't quite as funny, but that was funny too. Some of the most funny scenes were made with his foul mouthed, brilliant, BLACK ""sons."" The fact that he never really acknowledged that they weren't biologically his sons, but you knew that deep down he knew it and loved them anyway, it was rather endearing. And come on, the cop with the chicken up his azz, that was funny shite. This was classic Jim Carrey, and a great movie. NOBODY could have played a schizophrenic psychopath who fought with himself, and acted like an azz as well as Jim Carrey. And as for Irene, Renee Zellweger, she played the perfect victim/fugitive. The side plot with them falling in love was a perfect addition. At the end when Charlie ""gets the girl"" and the whole way in which he has her pulled over to ask her to marry him is great. I'm not a movie critic in any way, but I know what I like and I like this movie.","Me, Myself & Irene"

359,ILoveFuntamuch,Jim Carrey's Best and Funniest Comedy (but not the Farrelly Brothers),10,15 May 2002,"Jim Carrey was unbelievably underrated for his genius performance in this, one of the funniest movies of 2000.  many criticized ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" for being crude just for crudes sake, but at least most of the jokes were original (as in any Farrelly Brothers movie), and again, like in every Farrelly Brothers movie, there's always an underlying sweetness.  while it's only the Farrelly Brothers third-best movie (1. Kingpin, 2. There's Something About Mary, 4. Dumb and Dumber, 5.Shallow Hal), they have an amazing track record, with 4 out of their 5 movies being 4 of the funniest movies of all time. ""me, myself, and irene"" falls into the small category of movies (which include ""best in show"" and ""a fish called wanda"") that never fails to cheer me up when I'm in a bad mood, and if you weren't a fan the first time around, check it out again and pay strict attention to Carrey's amazing physical and all-around performance.""Did you just refer to yourself in the fifth-person?""- Irene","Me, Myself & Irene"

365,coffee-bot,Charlie-Hank (BUKOWSKI),10,27 April 2012,"""Charlie"" and ""Hank"", not a random coincidence that these are Charles Bukowski's names. Bukowski (portrayed in Shroeder's Barfly) was famously unstable, swinging from kind and lovable to mean and rowdy. Same extremes that Bailygates had in this movie. Charlie Bailygates/Bukowski loved women but often found them unapproachable. He was congenial and self-effacing easy to take advantage of.) The Hanks threatened people, loved slang and crude language, never backed down from a fight, and scared people. The Charlies got married, the Hanks got laid. I can't find this theory anywhere else online but I believe the Farrelly Bros. had this in mind. Also, most sources omit XTC's I'd Like To in their soundtrack.","Me, Myself & Irene"

I own two DVD's of Me. One for home and one in my backpack, just in case I'm stranded. This movie is great. Okay great may be overused, but that's a shame. The overuse of ""great"" does a disservice to those things of which the moniker ""great"" should be applied. Like Me, Myself and Irene. Combine the stand-up of Louis CK and Todd Barry and add three African American triplets who believe they are born of a Caucasian American (and he believes they, in turn, are from his loin). And in summation ( I was eavesdropping on a lawyer happy-hour) Hank's take on breast feeding as well as reading the paper on a not-so-endearing neighbor's lawn are worth a rental or at the very least a casual glance.

I'm doing a media essay at the moment and there is so much wrong with this film in terms of the medical side, that it adds another comedic point to it. Unfortunately the portrayal of mentally ill is damaging as they arnt violent. Just the media's over exaggerated mental illness. It just follows the stereotypical ideologies.Still thought it was very funny though.THis is Carrey at his best, and the black children gag works very well along with the midget joke.

The part when he shoots the cow six times was pretty funny, and also when he went nuts for the first time, but the humour was sometimes too crude. I'm sorry to all you hardcore fans out there (If you exist) but this movie was a pointless waste of two hours of my life. The dialogue with the limo driver was too stereotypical. One part of the film I really did like was the parts with the kids, ""Haw can you eat so much crap and not get fat!"" I think that Renee's acting was exceedingly poor, and her emotions just weren't carried across. There was only one serious bit for me in this movie, the part when Hank realises how much he offends people was touching. The funniest parts of the film were mostly at the beginning. Not a total failure, but nearly.Generally, about as good as a hat full of ass.","Me, Myself & Irene"
369,david-howes,"Good script, great Carrey, hilarious film",8,11 February 2005,"I watched this film after a friend recommended it to me. He said he knew I'd find it funny. I sighed, heard about the mediocre reviews it got on release and wasn't sure whether or not I could commit myself to sitting through something the world seemed indifferent about. However, I watched it in its entirety.From the off the flaws are easy to spot; an I-can-see-where-this-is-going plot and a script heavily reliant on Carrey's delivery- BUT That's about it. Because Me, Myself and Irene, simply put, is absolutely hilarious. You cannot strip this film of its comedic armour because although many of the jokes are crude, obvious and crass, it is put together for us the viewer so perfectly that it hits the funny bone just at the appropriate point when you fear the gag could fall flat. For me, a lot of effort seems to have gone into creating the right heady mix of nice scenery and open country to blend perfectly into the background of a world where Jim Carrey is allowed to take a dump on his neighbours' lawns and cows won't die after being repeatedly shot. The beautiful backdrop serves up this odd comedy and adds flavour to material that's purposely cute and crude.Any film that gives me indigestion and makes me rewind a frame over 4 times for the same joke is evidence enough that it's something worth seeing. You're not me, but if you find Jim Carrey even vaguely amusing and relish the thought of watching a character flip from one extreme personality to another with altogether surreal consequences, then it's likely to be the best film about a character who flips from one extreme personality to another with altogether surreal consequences you'll ever see.For an all-out assault on your sides, this film is very worth it. It's not Carrey's best film (see Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine or Liar Liar)  but it's certainly one of the funniest comedy's he's been in. Far superior to the Cable Guy, Bruce Almighty and the second Ace Ventura  I'd go as far as to say that the film is consistently funny enough to get a sequel with different actors and a smaller budget! And you know you're onto a franchise if that happens","Me, Myself & Irene"
