0,SnoopyStyle,gets rapey out of nowhere,5,18 June 2019,"Explorers break into a Pennsylvania underground cave system and are killed by deadly primeval flying creatures. The creatures are released spreading mayhem. They are commonly called vesps. Ally Andrews (Kiernan Shipka) is deaf. Her parents (Stanley Tucci, Miranda Otto) and family friend Glenn (John Corbett) decide to leave the populated city suburbs for the quieter countryside.It's trying to be A Quiet Place but it has none of the horror sensibilities. It doesn't have the style or the ability for the genre. I'm willing to go with it as a lesser action thriller. Instead, it turns religious rapey for no reason. The apocalyptic religious cult could be understandable but there is no need to get rapey. As for the creatures, they are not big enough or threatening enough. I can't see them break into a tank. If they could be defeated by a wood chipper, they could be defeated by many many things. Someone should build giant roving wood chippers. On the movie's side, this does have a few terrific actors. If only this could be better.",The Silence
1,claudio_carvalho,"Rip-off of ""A Quiet Place""",6,12 August 2020,"When a group of cave explorers unleashes a dangerous species of blind flying creatures named ""vesps"" from an underground mine, the population on Earth is attacked and killed by them. The government finds that the creatures attack through the human sound and requests people to stay quiet at home. However, the constructor Hugh Andrews (Stanley Tucci) decides to move to the countryside with his wife Kelly (Miranda Otto); their teenage daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka), who lost her hearing a couple of years ago in a car accident; their son Jude (Kyle Breitkopf); Kelly's mother Lynn (Kate Trotter), who has lung cancer; and their dog Otis in the family car. Their friend Glenn (John Corbett) joins them in his own car. Glenn has a car accident and attracts the vesps. Later Hugh and his family leave the car and walk communicating only in sign language seeking shelter in the countryside. Will they find a safe place?The film ""The Silence"" (2019) is a rip-off of ""A Quiet Place"" (2018), trying to explore the success if the 2018 movie. The novel of Tim Lebbon ""The Silence"" may have been published in 2015, but the story of a world without sound was developed by Brian Woods and Scott Beck when they were at college. The veteran cast with Stanley Tucci and Miranda Otto have good performances but are quite old to have a sixteen-year-old daughter and a younger son. However, the film is not as bad as written in many reviews. If the viewer watches with lesser expectations he or she may be surprised by a reasonable adventure. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Silêncio"" (""The Silence"")",The Silence
2,nogodnomasters,This is private property,5,29 April 2019,"Ancient creatures that lived isolated in a cavern are set loose and attack anything that makes noise. They are blind but still love cell phones ring tones. The story is about one family's fight for survival. Rather than stay at home and sleep it off, they opt to travel north and are soon in the path of the ""Vesps.""The Vesps look like a combination of bats and pterodactyls. The Andrews family knows sign because their daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka) became deaf in an auto accident. This gives them some advantage...if they didn't have a barking dog.This is an also ran in the series of films that have come out that require people to either be silent or blind to survive. No one explained the Ecosystem of the vesps and what they fed on for millions of years in isolation, but clearly they required oxygen. They were attracted to a shredder in a suicide fashion...so just leave it turned on as well as jet engines etc. What could be so hard?How long does it take for weird cults to develop?Now the location of the cave was given at 100 ft below the Appalachian Trail in Pa. If you want to access it, the legendary location is at a rock cropping up high at the Leigh Valley river gap near Slatington. It is known to the locals as the Devil's Pulpit. The access way is constricted. It will take a small thin person. You must shimmy along a narrow rock ledge to get there. Not responsible for those that get cursed for entering.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Silence
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's watchable, has some good moments, but it's all been done, to death.",6,13 April 2019,"There's a definite trend with this kind of movie, and it all began with A Quiet Place, then came Birdbox, which for me was the best, and now we get this offering.Half of the plot is nicked from the Meg, the rest comes from the previously mentioned Quiet Place, I was so excited by the thought of a film about Vampire bats, but it never quite fully delivers.Stanley Tucci is pretty good, in a role that he never seems to get, but young Kiernan Shipka is the best aspect.We used to get shed loads of found footage films, now it's films about not making a noise, this trend needs to stop, it's already overdone.Nicely made, with some good production values, but on the whole it's very average.",The Silence
4,lee_eisenberg,"sorry, but this is no ""Quiet Place""",4,12 April 2019,"Part of what made ""A Quiet Place"" good was the casting of the authentically deaf Millicent Simmonds as a deaf girl, and also giving Emily Blunt a chance to play a different kind of character (not to mention that she and real-life husband John Krasinski play husband and wife). ""The Silence"" is a lame version starring a non-deaf person. I know that there are those who will argue that it's just acting, but this takes the role away from authentically deaf actresses who already have enough trouble finding roles. An OK way to pass time, but no comparison to ""A Quiet Place"".That one scene did come across as a neat homage to ""Fargo"", though.",The Silence
5,michaelRokeefe,Silence becomes life saving in the dark,4,6 June 2020,"Terrifying creatures mutated from bats are like a plague controlling the earth. Humans will realize that the only defense they have is...silence. A 16-year-old girl (Klernin Shipka) , who lost her hearing three years earlier, becomes an unlikely hero. Clever trailers built up loads of interest until you realize this movie is not so unique. Didn't we just see something like this not too long ago. Not exactly a thinking person's film, but there are a couple of jump scares. If there was just some logic to justify fear factor. The cast includes Stanely Tucci, Kate Trotter and John Corbett.",The Silence
6,CinemaSerf,Pipistrelle with attitude.,6,18 July 2020,"A group of miners accidentally disturb a nest of hungry ""Vesps"" that breed like rabbits and are soon hunting/eating mankind to the brink of extinction. Luckily for Ally (Kiernan Shipka) - a 16 year old girl who lost her hearing in a tragic car accident; she and her close family can all sign, so they can more easily avoid these bat-like creatures that hunt by sound. Stanley Tucci is the dad, leading this small family to what they hope will be a haven from their airborne predators. It's not new, there are plenty of similar stories out there, but it is quite a classily produced little number. The actors do work together quite well to create some sort of menace as they fight off the creatures; and some rather peculiar human foes as well on their trek. The ending isn't up to much though - maybe teeing up for a sequel, but generally I quite enjoyed it.",The Silence
7,view_and_review,Complete Rip Off,3,11 April 2019,"I watched this movie with more than a little bias. After all, didn't Emily Blunt just star in a movie with the very SAME premise?? Hello? Ever hear of ""A Quiet Place""? So forgive me if I'm totally unimpressed.This is quite literally the same movie with different beasts, down to the deaf girl. ""Bird Box"" was close enough IMO but I guess Netflix wanted to go for the full rip off and came out with this.Instantly I had to give it a zero for originality--on multiple levels. There are a slew of post-apocalypse movies and shows that ""The Silence"" liberally borrowed from. And you would think with all of the apocalyptic data out there ready for consumption that just once there'd be a person/family/group smart enough to know when they're confronting a dangerous person that needs to be neutralized immediately. Yet, time and time again the hearts bleed and the doors open or the weapons lower to let the cunning lunatic live only to cause considerable harm later.Truly, I'm surprised they greenlighted this movie. ""A Quiet Place"", along with being first, was much better. At least in ""A Quiet Place"" they had the courtesy to give us subtitles for the broken sign language they were doing. In this movie they left people to guess what was being said. But I'll go one farther: ""Descent,"" which they kind of borrowed from as well--and was probably the original ""be quiet"" scary movie--was better than this. Maybe in 2017 this would've been good, but in 2019, after a really good movie with the same plot: not so good.",The Silence
8,trashgang,creatures are headlining but the story slowly moves away from them,6,31 May 2019,"Just a mediocre horror flick I don't have to say more about it. So typical, what starts off pretty good turns into a flick with a weak storyline. What the hell are those people doing there in that particular city. What have they to do with the creatures. What with the ending? How did they find where they have to go?But the beginning is a good start and only for that you should pick it up. Promoted with the Sabrina series background because two from that serie are in it. as said, mediocre because halfway it turns away from the creatures...

9,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Fairly effective horror film,7,18 April 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSome deadly bats, with the ability to overpower and kill humans, have escaped from their enclave, and have their sights set on taking over the world. Hugh Andrews (Stanley Tucci) must protect his family, including his daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka) who suffers from acute deafness, and needs to communicate in sign language, which comes in handy since the terrifying flying beasts react most forcefully to sound.Horror has become a genre as largely manufactured as pop music these days, an original idea an occasional bonus, secondary to cheap CGI and jump scares. And so, the recent theatrically released A Quiet Place, divided opinion, a creative premise at least, in spite of its outlandishness. Its certainly that film that first springs to mind when presented with The Silence, despite also being a hodgepodge of other such films in the cultural consciousness, including The Mist and Cloverfield.Despite arriving in its shadow, I'd still consider The Silence the better film between it and AQP. It at least establishes something in the way of human connection with the main characters, and takes the time to develop them in an effective way, meaning we care about them more. Its also easier to digest some flying, killer bats than it is giant, spider like things. Performances wise, Tucci is sturdy and reliable in the lead, strongly supported by Shipka in the crucial role as his deaf daughter.It's impressive and effective, for a film that manages to cram it all into ninety minutes. While not a perfect film, its certainly a huge step up from a guy whose directorial debut was Mortal Kombat: Annihilation! ***",The Silence
10,Edvis-1997,7,7,16 April 2019,"The plot is kind of the same like The Quiet Place or I Am Legend.Can't say it surpass them or was even equal to them but still wasn't bad or boring. Story is kind of catchy,can't say it was horror movie as it is described but as a thriller it was decent movie. I believe those commentators with 1/10 or 3/10 shouldn't compare different films and say ohh it was worse than this. So what? You're making this film review not comparing entire film universe. Worth to watch don't listen to haters stay positive.",The Silence
11,bowmanblue,'The Quiet Place's' lesser-known cousin,5,27 April 2019,"Anyone who's been into films over the years will recognise that weird trend where two films arrive on the scene at almost the exact same time and both cover near identical topics ('Armageddon/Deep Impact, Mars Attacks/Independence Day, Dante's Peak/Volcano' and so on). In 2018 us horror fans were treated to an unexpectedly little awesome film where monsters took over the world who hunted humans purely by noise. This was, of course, 'A Quiet Place.' Now - sort of - a year later, along comes 'The Silence.'And - guess what - it's about a load of monsters who hunt entirely by sound attacking the world. Now, if that was the only similarity I could probably be a little more forgiving on 'The Silence' and, from what I've read online, so many of the similarities are purely coincidental. Unfortunately, it doesn't hide the fact that if you've already watched 'A Quiet Place' then you've already seen everything 'The Silence' has to offer - only much, much better.I feel bad about running 'The Silence' down too much. It's not that bad and I'm guessing if you HAVEN'T seen 'A Quiet Place' then you'll enjoy it all the more. However, pretty much every aspect I saw was done better.'The Silence' is about a family. So it 'A Quiet Place.' Only the family in 'A Quiet Place' are far more interesting and likable. Actually, the family in 'The Silence' are so annoyingly-perfect that I found it quite grating. And, the family in both know 'sign language' due to the daughter (in both) being deaf, therefore giving them a tactical advantage at living in silence.I could go on with the similarities, but there are too many to mention. Plus the monsters in 'The Silence' aren't half as nasty-looking (or well animated with computer effects) than 'A Quiet Place.' I will say that about the only major difference between the two were the films' starting points. 'The Silence' kicks off before the monsters attack whereas 'A Quiet Place' begins long after humanity has almost been hunted to extinction.Basically, if I hadn't seen 'A Quiet Place' I could probably have enjoyed 'The Silence' so much more, so, if you only see one monster-munching film about blind monsters who hunt through sound, I think you can tell by now which one I'd recommend!",The Silence
12,Platypuschow,The Silence: Should/could have been better,6,11 April 2019,"Based on the concept I was rather surprised that Netflix would venture into material so similiar to one of their other films (A Quiet Place) and so shockingly fast. I can however say this is a different movie altogether, though not really in good way.Early on I was gripped, fantastically made and looking film where Tucci is on the best form I've seen him since The Lovely Bones (2009). This I thought was going to be something really special, but alas the quality dipped pretty hardcore in the last act.It tells the story of small winged creatures that begin to besiege the world in a near apocalyptic event. They respond only to sound so the trick is silence (See where the Quiet Place comparison comes in?). The film follows a family surviving in this world, led by father Tucci and daughter played by Kiernan ""Sabrina"" Shipka.The cast deliver, the sfx are passable and the whole thing is well constructed but religion takes the stage and ruins the film. Despite being a near theocratic nation I'm still amazed how critical Hollywood usually is over religion and The Silence is no different. It takes a hyper realistic angle here with the religious's interpretation of the incident and it's positively chilling because it's so very believable.I wish they hadn't gone down that route, though realistic it made for uncomfortable viewing and led the movie to a satisfying yet sudden and rather incomplete finale.The Silence should/could have been an outstanding film but instead came out as a real disappointment.The Good:Tucci is on top formSome solid ideasThe Bad:Certain flaws in logic and consistencyGoes in an uncomfortable direction",The Silence
13,The-Sarkologist,A bit hit and miss,4,20 May 2020,"Okay, while to date I have not seen 'The Quiet Place', a part of me feels that the plot is pretty similar. I guess it stood out when I started watching it and discovered that it is about this horde of creatures that begin devastating the United States, and that these creatures are attracted by sound. As I said, I haven't seen A Quiet Place, but I knew enough about it to know that that film is also about creatures that are attracted by sound.The film follows a family that decides to flee to the country after a horde of creatures that had been released from a mine descend upon the North-Eastern United States, laying waste to pretty much everything, or more precisely pretty much killing anybody and everybody that they happen to come across. That is pretty much what the film is about, though when one gets closer to the end it sort of morphs into one of those post-apocalyptic style of films, and not a particularly good one at that.Yeah, a couple of the characters decide to go to town, and meet up with this leader of a cult, a cult who had decided that the best way to deal with this creatures is to basically cut their tongues out. The cult then discovers where they are hiding, and you sort of have this big battle where the cult is defeated and the survivors then head off further north for refuge. Of course there is also a love interest there as well.Honestly, this film wasn't too great, though I guess it probably has something with it being a straight to Netflix release. I guess the reason that it annoyed me was because it really did feel quite rushed at the end, with the cult and all of that. In fact, it sort of felt as if it was tacked onto the end just to make the film somewhat more interesting. Then again, it really didn't grab me all that much, and with that bit tacked on at the end, it sort of started putting me off somewhat.In a way I'm not entirely sure what this film was trying to do. Like, one of the main characters was deaf, and they were claiming that she knew how to be silent, except that being deaf sort of doesn't work like that. In fact, it is the opposite because being deaf means that you really can't work out if you are making sound or not, and in my mind it would be much more of a hindrance in this situation. Actually, I suspect being blind would be more appropriate, but they decided to go with being deaf, which sort of put me off.Yeah, honestly, I wouldn't really bother with this film all that much. It isn't that great, and there are plenty of other films on the service that are worth watching as opposed to this particular one.",The Silence
14,UniqueParticle,"To whom may or may not see this, The Silence is outstanding!",8,25 April 2019,"Very good, sound based & silent too. Incredible thriller I guess Netflix has several horror dramas now that primarily base off the immersive experience within sound effects like ""Bird Box"", ""The Silence"" is very different cause it has more to do with lunatic sick creatures.I very much like this take on madness with gross reptiles, excellent cast & editing too. Very creepy gang in the last half of the movie too. Also same with other movies I loved this despite its flaws; sure the they could've killed the creatures easily but that's not this type of story and I'm ok with that.",The Silence
15,cruise01,"Scary less, lacking in thrills, and a concept that has been done before.",5,15 April 2019,"The Silence (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Silence has a similar concept idea of an another horror film like The Quiet Place were characters are trying to survive in the apocalyptic world from beasts while being completely silent. Does this film succeed as a good horror film? Not really, it may be the cheaper version of the concept. This film being an adaptation of a novel.The plot follows a research team exploring new caves and they discover some bats like creatures called vesps that were buried in the dark caves for a long time. They are blind and attack at anything that moves or makes a noise. A family Hugh (Stanley Tucci) and his wife Kelly (Miranda Otto) and there teenage daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka) who is deaf. The family packs up and leaves when they see this apocalypse happening. While trying to stay alive from these vesps and other threats that are people going insane. They will have to remain quiet and silent as they travel.It could have been a good film if it had some suspense and thrills. Or even scares. This film lacks about everything. There is no suspense build up. Yes, these characters get stuck in a situation were these vesps have them trap or they are trying to figure a way out. Or even worse when they come across a cult like group that has there own tongues cut out and after the family. It does have a dull direction that did not even try for any scares. The visual effects on the vesps or on some action sequences with explosions looked a bit obvious and cheap. The acting was not any better as well. Kiernan Shipka is a good actress. She playing a deaf girl did not look or feel like she was deaf. She seemed normal and responded to others very normally. Stanley Tucci was okay as well but his character was a bit flat. Miranda Otto was also flat as well.Overall, The Silence is a pretty bad film. The acting was bad. The script and direction was dull and delivered flat characters and no suspense or thrills. It is like the scary less version of an A Quiet Place movie.",The Silence
16,TheMovieDiorama,"The Silence mutes any and all brain activity, sending viewers into a quiet sleep.",2,5 January 2020,"""Shhhh! Be vewy vewy quiet! I'm hunting carnivewous ancient bats!"". For even the most minuscule of noises will send a swarm of 'Pitch Black' 'Doctor Who'-esque bat demons that will scratch, bite and gnaw at your flesh. Based on a novel apparently, however any and all originality was tossed out of the family car window when both the superior 'A Quiet Place' and hugely popular 'Bird Box' were capitalising on the whole ""sense prevention"" horror schtick. Basically, it's both those films put together. Ancient bat creatures are released from an uncharted cave system and are terrorising the continent of North America, where we follow a family trying to survive and reach a refuge.Problem is, this family is so chilled and relaxed during this heightened state of emergency, that any and all threat is relinquished from the nonchalant acting and careless attitudes. Urgh, honestly! Leonetti is doing his absolute best in unimaginatively mimicking other similar films, where veteran and all-round talent Tucci is waltzing around the countryside showing a face of ""I can't be bothered, release me from this torturous nightmare"".Plagued by infuriatingly stupid plot conveniences and character choices, the severe lack of tension halts the momentum entirely. Heck, it's not even in neutral anymore. It's reversing! Examples include (brace yourself...): handing a handgun to the uncle who is then left to die, ginger son conveniently switching cars before one of them veers over a verge, iPhones instantly muting themselves when submerged in water for a total of three seconds and bringing an obviously loud dog with you. That last example, accompanied with an unnecessary scene involving members of the public banishing a mother and her baby due to generating far too much noise, are simply utilised to showcase the destructive nature of humanity. Yup. Humans suck, and this film wants you to know that. You shan't be scared by the horrifically visualised bat demons that look smoother than Tucci's bald head. It's the characters that'll get under your skin and infuriate you.Need more proof? The entire third act. Father and daughter wander off to the nearest pharmacy, surprisingly making zero noise whatsoever on the way there, and encounter a mentally unstable reverend who yearns to fertilise young girls to maintain the population and chop their tongues off (after the foreplay, obviously...). What. The. Hell? That was so left field that even the flying angels didn't see that coming. The narrative focus shifts constantly, making an already boring premise even more tediously mundane.Aside from one sacrifice towards the conclusion that had some emotional gravitas, The Silence offers nothing more than another forced extraction of this now dull horror concept. Actors weren't trying, direction was unstable and the insufficient amount of scares were, well, insufficient. Oh wait, I forgot! It literally ends on the daughter becoming survivalist-styled Lara Croft and hunting these winged menaces down. Oh no no! I'm done! Just watch 'A Quiet Place' instead...",The Silence
17,Tweetienator,Typical Modern Underachiever,5,11 April 2019,"The machine must be fed - The Silence is an okay movie made for a mass audience, and as all those pay-channels and whatever channels need ""stuff"" to air, the need for an endless stream of new shows and movies is great. This simply results to that immense output of mediocre to underachieving movies/shows: quantity rules our days and not quality.Anyway, with the same cast and the same production but a better and more careful composed script and directing, this movie could have been a really good one.The Silence: only recommendable for the aficionado of the genre (post-apocalypse with alien/monsters), and only if you really got nothing else on the plate.",The Silence
18,kevin_robbins,It was a little hard for me to get over how unoriginal the film was from beginning to end,6,24 May 2021,"Last week I watched The Silence on Netflix, which felt like a combination of Quiet Place, Bird Box and Pitch Black...while not being as good as any of them. The movie is in a world that has been taken over by creatures that react to noise and eats anything they hear. Shockingly, the storyline follows a family with a deaf girl that relies on sign language. As the world's resources diminish people become desperate and the family encounters hardship and desperation like they never had before. One thing I will say about this movie is the special effects were first rate, the challenges the family faces were entertaining and I liked the conclusion. It was a little hard for me to get over how unoriginal the film was from beginning to end; however, the movie has enough redeeming elements to make it worth a viewing.

The Vespas are well imagined, the size of a Pterosaur you'd use for falconry. This has all the ingredients for a very good Post-Apocalypse film but the script is wanting at times and doesn't complement the effective action scenes.

The usual tropes assert themselves quickly (the abandoned city centers, a member of the family getting hurt needing medicine or else & a nomadic band of humans using the current apocalypse as a means to control & subjugate the remaining populace).

26,I_Ailurophile,Finely made creature feature,8,2 July 2021,"The opening scene is immediately captivating, and believable as a starting point for the narrative. The opening credits, with a montage of nature and civilization, is pointedly jarring, along with Thomas Hajdu and Andy Milburn's score. 'The silence' works hard to get our attention right away, and to its credit, it keeps it.It's hardly possible to watch 'The silence' without immediately thinking of 'A quiet place,' as both share the premise of creatures that hunt by sound. Yet any concern I had about their similarity - especially for as closely to each other that they were released - is quickly dispelled, as the narrative here follows a different slant: The introduction of the creatures to the world, and the onset of the noiseless apocalypse.Putting aside the nature of the antagonistic force, the narrative in 'The silence' is relatively conventional: carefree exposition, sudden alarm, attempt to escape and survive, all following a single family. Nonetheless, it keeps us readily engaged - and this is certainly in thanks as well to the excellence of the film otherwise.The creatures look great and plausibly realistic in design, behavior, and apparent life cycle. The adapted screenplay by Carey and Shane Van Dyke does a great job of imparting the mounting horror in a world gone to hell, while director John R. Leonetti has a keen eye for some fine shots, and an attention to detail that captures every subtlety. The cast also contributes masterfully to the film's success. Steady, reliable Stanley Tucci is most visible, but it's a joy as well to see Miranda Otto in her prominent supporting role. I especially like Kiernan Shipka in her portrayal of Ally - the teenage daughter, who also serves initially as narrator - giving the girl a resolve, even in her fearfulness, that's impressive to watch.The employment of pathetic fallacy at the climax is maybe a bit much, but the scene still looks great all the same, and is duly riveting. I'm likewise not especially fond of the narration over the final scene; as is the case with almost any movie that uses such a voiceover, it's simply unnecessary, and in my mind detracts from the ending.Yet those are the only points of criticism that immediately come to mind. This isn't to say that 'The silence' is perfect, but it's entertaining, engrossing, and suitably thrilling. Viewers who are looking for an especially bloody, visceral fright fest may be better served elsewhere, but for a more general audience this fills a niche that only horror purists are likely to sidestep. Even with a story that's a little predictable and not unfamiliar, 'The silence' is worth checking out.",The Silence
27,s3276169,Silence is golden.....,8,11 April 2019,"This is not the first time a film has been made about a menacing predatory force that can only be contained by silence. That said, to my mind, this is by far and away the best film in this vein I have seen to date.What makes this film work so well is its pacing and atmosphere. There's a sense of constant, relentless threat, that is not limited to the predatory creatures that have been set loose upon the world.Combine this with decent acting from the cast and creepy, menacing, creature effects and you have a real winner in this survivalist horror.8/10 from me.",The Silence
28,peterp-450-298716,Too many similarities with other recent movies.,3,12 June 2019,"What the hell does that mean?
""Don't make noise.""There are still certainties in this world. First of all, you can expect that if a type of movie has enormous success, something similar will appear in no time. A matter of surfing on the wave of success, I guess. ""The Silence"" resembles, for instance, the successful film ""A Quiet Place"". It's not exactly the same thing, but there are a huge number of similarities with the latter (And yes I know both films were made almost simultaneously and it's based on a novel from 2015. But still!). And then it appears once again that humans are the cause of problems. So this time no space monsters with a sophisticated hearing organ, like in ""A Quiet Place"". Now there are some over-enthusiastic speleologists who can't resist sticking their noses into something out of curiosity. In particular, a cave that they have discovered. Cries of joy are quickly replaced by cries of fear and hysterical whining, the moment they break through the cave wall. What these human moles didn't realize was that they were about to release some prehistoric bat-like creatures into the world. Beings who, after years of living in the dark, only rely on their hearing so they can find another victim. Best advice? Be silent.The biggest difference with ""A Quiet Place"" is the unveiling of the bloodthirsty, ruthless flying monsters. In ""A Quiet Place"" it took a while. In ""The Silence"" you don't have to wait that long before you see the little monsters at work. Yet there are several similarities to be discovered. So the word plagiarism is very quickly dangling off the tip of your tongue. Again it's about a family with two children with daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka) also having a hearing problem. Although not congenital but because of a terrible accident in which her grandparents also perish. Here too there are certain confounding factors among the family members that could put others life at risk. In ""A Quiet Place"" it was a newborn baby whose crying was a lure for the terrible creatures. Here it's grandmother Lynn (Kate Trotter) with an annoying cough and the dog Otis who barks all the time. And just like in ""Bird Box"" there is a safe haven where everyone is heading for.""The silence"" clearly has similarities with a whole bunch of other movies. The disadvantage is that you have an early feeling of haven't-we-seen-this-already-before. Even though it is all a bit more action-packed and at certain moments more exciting. On the other hand, it's true that not showing the imminent danger immediately (such as in ""A Quiet Place"") ensures that you'll be waiting with bated breath for that revelation. The biggest difference lies in the religious aspect that's incorporated in the story. The Apocalypse breaks out and before you know it there's some ingenious person who immediately starts a cult.As with any religion, this self-proclaimed religious leader also introduces a dogma that makes it impossible to jeopardize the cult through unexpected, loud noises. The dogma involves a radical intervention on the followers. It is hoped that none of them will get stomach flu, with noisy flatulence as a result. Or that one of the short-sighted followers is a bit too obese, which makes that moving around is quite noisy. Away tactical advantage, I would say. In short, another proof that religion cannot be associated with logical reasoning. On the other hand, they were interested in the fertility of the young girl. Well, that says a lot.And unfortunately, the film is full of such pathetic ridiculous things. Actually, it was already stupid of them to ride off in a noisy car. And of course, they flee, even though the authorities advised to stay indoors. And wasn't there anyone smart enough to simply keep the wood chipper running constantly? Maybe an annoying, maddening noise. But anything's better than being eaten by naked, bat-like flying dinosaurs. With united forces, they could easily have destroyed the colony of animals in one fell swoop. Or were there really so many of these creatures? And nobody here who thinks to throw an object to mislead these creatures? Nope. They do things the hard way and start waving around with a mop.Fortunately, the acting performances weren't of a lousy low level. It's always a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci at work. Although I thought his personage was more interesting in ""Patient Zero"". Unfortunately, that movie wasn't very good. Apparently, there's also a lot of criticism from the deaf community about the non-deaf Kiernan Shipka playing the role of Ally. According to them, it's impossible for her to understand what it feels like to be deaf and also that her sign language wasn't flawless. Could be. But I don't agree with regard to empathizing with her character. Couldn't a talented actress or actor empathize to such an extent that it comes across as convincing? I assume that Denzel Washington and Nicolas Cage don't have a drinking problem. And yet their interpretations as an alcoholic in ""Flight"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" were damn realistic enough for me. And I am able to objectively assess that, believe me. And finally admiration for Kyle Breitkopf as the younger brother Jude.All in all, this film is the weakest one from the ""Netflix Originals"" stable. As a horror, it's a total failure. It's never really scary or exciting. The tension is removed by portraying the scary animals very early in the film. This type of film involves more than just portraying a lot of hysterically screaming people (which in turn has bad consequences for them). No, there are certainly better alternatives to view. And if you don't know which one I mean, I recommend a reread.",The Silence

All departments did an underwhelming job here from writing to direction to visual effects to sound design. The cult angle in the final act was quite simply the nail in the coffin.

We have a deaf character here too, but Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) doesn't act deaf. She just talks like anybody else.

It's not like this is Shakespeare.Anyways, the production is much bigger and we get some well done scenes that use the tension of the concept (similar to AQP), but still not enough to justifiy other sideplots. Also the ending is so cliché. Another Netflix movie missing the opportunity of not being mainstream Hollywood.In the end, I'm just not on board with this concept, but at least A Quiet Place committed to the ""you can't make a sound"" idea, producing a really especial kind of movie.

38,petra_ste,Stanley Tucci versus dwarf pterodactyls,5,23 May 2019,"The cinematic equivalent of tofu, this movie is bearable but bland; a bargain bin version of A Quiet Place with another family hunted by noise-sensitive monsters and a deaf daughter whose knowledge of sign language proves useful.I really liked A Quiet Place, plot holes and all. The first half was a masterclass in building up suspense and dread, with phenomenal tension and great use of sound. The Silence, while not amateurish, falls really short by comparison; it's a lot more ""Oh no here come the beasties! Phew phew! Run!"".This is a pet peeve of mine but I'm really tired of post-apocalyptic/disaster/zombie stories with a group of evil survivors replacing the monsters as the antagonists (see The Walking Dead). I understand actors are cheaper than CGI but still, I think I've had enough of ""Bwah-ha-ha!"" evil cults/gangs for a lifetime.Thankfully, the evil survivors in The Silence do *not* actually go ""Bwah-ha-ha!"", mostly because they have cut off their own tongues. There is a truly hilarious moment where their leader sneers at the protagonists after they have refused to join his cult (a scene Tucci plays as if he is hurrying away from a smelly hobo asking for money). Tucci and his daughter leave the bad guy standing alone in the middle of the road and he opens his mouth with a disgusted grimace, like a cat who has smelled something bad. It's meant to show us he is nuts and has removed his own tongue, but I was howling with laughter.Another funny bit comes in the middle of an otherwise decent set-piece, as Tucci's family is crawling through a tunnel and the creatures have found them. Tucci turns on a woodchipper and all the beasts just dive into it, mangled into sprays of blood within a few seconds. And these things brought mankind to the verge of extinction? Seriously?Overall, not terrible but mediocre. If you missed A Quiet Place, watch that one instead.5,5/10",The Silence

Please film makers we're not stupid. This sheer lack of attention and the ringing of the fathers mobile phone when earlier in the film he tells everyone to turn their phones to silent, come on please!The creatures or should I say the special effects that were the creatures were excellent but the whole film just ended up being silly and again I cone back to the cult (WHY).Rating 4 out of 10",The Silence

55,nitzanhavoc,"""Sense Deprivation"" Horror strikes again. Unimpressive, but definitely enjoyable with lowered expectations.",6,21 November 2020,"If you're anything like many others - you've already learnt to always lower your expectations before watching a Netflix original film (their shows tend to be quite impressive, or so I hear, but their films are usually mediocre at best). This attitude has honestly served me well while watching The Silence, as I've actually found myself quite entertained. While not more than average - it isn't bad and definitely didn't feel like a waste of time. Mostly unimpressive, still fun.First of all, I'm quite impressed with the latest movement of ""sense deprivation"" Horror films. Hush put us through the experience of a deaf victim trapped by a stalker; Bird Box (another Netflix original) has told the story of evil entities who can only afflict their victim if seen by them (therefore putting us through the experience of people forced into voluntary blindness of sorts); and now The Silence presents a scenario in which speaking above a whisper might bring upon a terrible fate, through the eyes of a family fluent in sign language (pretty ""convenient"", but serves the plot). While all these films haven't yet fulfilled the full potential of this genuine idea - all are, in my opinion, equally entertaining and rewarding in their own way.The Silence begins with another cliché end-of-the-world event, this time in the shape of CreepyPasta-looking deadly creatures who hunt by sound. It's actually less silly than it sounds, but not by far. The plot is very roughly and bluntly divided into three parts, each receiving pretty much the same amount of screen time: exposition (what happened, how and to whom); initial coping and survival (what do we do now?); and the encounter with the actual enemy. It pretty much felt like watching three episodes of a mini-series with at least four, as the ending is pretty disappointing and leaves too many loose ends untied (not just enough to be an intriguing and debatable open ending, just not really an ending in my opinion).Nothing about The Silence is extraordinary, for better or worse. The story is okay, the acting is okay (aside from K. Shipka who was very impressive as recently-deafened Ally, managing to design her speech to be just a little off, very authentic and convincing!), the cinematography and soundtrack is okay, everything is just okay and just enough to have a good time if you don't expect to have your mind blown or your feet swept.",The Silence

It makes no sense to leave if you don't know where you're going. They ended up in a remote place, fighting to survive but we didn't get to see how they got there.

""The Silence"" is not a masterpiece either, but this time it's not only the director that can be blamed.First of all, We've seen all of this before - on a better level. The plot is weak, confused, choppy and too straight-forward. As a matter of fact, my favorite story detail was the inclusion of the religious fanatics, which had so much more potential. However, maybe that inclusion wasn't even needed, the story is so unfocused, jumping from thing to another, not being sure of what it wants to say. And You know what? I guess that's what happens when the script is written by the guy who wrote ""Titanic II"". It's probably a good idea for Netflix not to get involved with Asylum filmmakers - we all know what abominations go on there.The script & the story, in my opinion, is the single biggest flaw here, for it can mess up a lot of other aspects. I can't complain much about acting - everybody did their best, even Stanley Tucci tried - but how much can actor bring out of a weak script & a vague character? One thing that wasn't below average was the cinematography - decent camera work, nice color grading etc. Regarding the visuals, the cgi is quite noticeable in more than two scenes. Oh, the soundtrack was pretty fine, I was impressed by the title sequence - but that was all I was impressed by.It's not much about anything, not really about bats, maybe about the good, old family values.

1. When hollywood finally decides to make a bat horror movie this is what u get.
2. Why did the family even leave their home?
3. Lazy cgi movie no practical monster effects.
4. Guy choose to take his own life and drive down a ditch because of some deers on the road.
5. First bat attack and whole family is screaming like 5 year olds. Dogs barking, old Lady have screamqueen contest.
6. Why do they turn of the engine if they allready decided not to be quiet?
7. Why don't they let mans worst friend ""the barking dog out of the car sooner?
8. Why did the father throw away the irontire?
A great blunt weapon. Also idiotic to leave all the guns behind. Even the second time he make a viking funeral of hos friend he forgets the guns.
9. When he says no cellphones no text?? You can turn of sound and still text and call.
10. The creatures needs to be in a very close proximity to hear them, like 50meters studying the movie they Only attack if the swarm is at close proximity.
11. They find a Cabin in the woods and decide that's a better house then their own home.
12. The old lady clearly knew about the bats cause she had alarmbells on the gate.
Why tf did she act and scream like she didn't?
13. You don't die and act sick if you get a few scratches on the leg, you wash it and bandages it then up and move.
I give up i could go on and on forever.
This movie is truly a stinker. The director must have a few some health issues. It just can't get any stupier. Watch something else instead.",The Silence
60,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""The Silence"" (2019)",7,17 April 2019,"""The Silence"" may be dreck, but it's good dreck.If you've read anything about this new Netflix movie, than you know it's regarded as a lower-budget ripoff of the immensely well received ""A Quiet Place"" (2018). (Both follow a family surviving an apocalyptic invasion by monsters who hunt by sound.) And I suppose it is, with a bit saccharine teen drama and a neglected cult subplot shoehorned into it.But I'd be lying if I told you I didn't enjoy it at all. I'd rate it a 7 out of 10 for being a fairly entertaining creature feature.Stanley Tucci and Miranda Otto are always great to watch, and the Kiernan Shipka is a cute kid with a lot of charisma. (Am I the only guy in the world who thinks that Tucci is extremely talented? To appreciate his range, compare his milquetoast suburban dad here with his growling, menacing super-zombie in last year's ""Patient Zero."")The monsters were suitably revolting and well rendered, and the action sequences were mostly engaging. (The scene involving a well was well executed - no pun intended.) Maybe I'm just a kid at heart and want more creepy crawlies in my horror films, as opposed to endless demons and shrieking wraiths.Here's the key to enjoying it - think of it as a throwback to cheesy 70's monster movies like ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" or ""Damnation Alley"" (1977). We had fun with those when we were kids, didn't we?",The Silence

63,CountJonnie,"Not a ripoff, pretty entertaining but big flaws",6,14 April 2019,"The movie is not ripoff off Bird Box and A Quiet Place, even though it shares elements with those and even Pitch Black. A family trying to survive blind monsters that hunt through sound, forcing them to be silent, is pretty entertaining in it's quick paced run, while battling even other 'monsters'.But the real big flaws are:
1) Being rushed. The movie never feels slow, which is a good thing, but some moments it feels like days, but some communities have degraded as if the events last ages.
2) In addition to point 1, the religious group added some nice suspence, but came out of nowhere. Pretty rushed and pointless.
3) The typical death of the experienced military guy in the beginning, to make the odds worse.
4) Worst of all, the deaf daughter. It's a cliche that adds totally nothing to the story. The most nonsensical part is that she offers to look for something, because she is used to silence. Which is idiotic, because if she's deaf, she wouldn't notice if she accidentally made noise.And more, but point 4 was the most annoying onee. Still, thanks to some action and fast pacing, the movie is still entertaining and worth the watch.",The Silence
64,Thrashman88,Close But No Cigar,6,19 April 2019,"There's something odd with Netflix original movies. They usually start out great, have an interesting follow through and when it comes to the big ending, they fall flat. ""The Silence"" is sadly no exception. Once more, Netflix takes us to a post apocalyptic setting, where bizarre underground creatures are freed from a remote cave in the Appalachian mountains, to wreak havoc upon the U.S.
There are plenty of chills and thrills and the acting is pretty solid, despite having a deaf girl who can speak without any impediments apparently. The flying creatures, who look like oversized bats, are drawn to noise, and attack the source in an attempt to eat whatever is making the sound. The creatures have no eyes, so they've developed a very accurate hearing capacity.There's plenty of gore and guts, as the movie follows a family desperately trying to flee from the flying terror. We know the family tries to travel north of the country, as these creatures apparently are affected by colder weather.When the family reach their northern destination, wham: the movie ends, just like that, almost in cliffhanger fashion! It's as if this was the pilot for some new series, but I think not. As far as abrupt endings go, ""The Silence"" will surely win an award. If it is indeed the pilot for a new series, I wouldn't mind Netflix telling us so. This was a pretty interesting thriller up the last minute before the ending. Something like ""The Rain"" or even ""The Walking Dead"" could come out of this, but it seems not.Watch it for the thrills and chills only.",The Silence
65,WalkdenEntertainment,"Nothing new, Nothing Fresh...Just Silence",2,19 April 2019,"The world becomes chaos when bat-like creatures are discovered in a cave. These creatures react to sound and are ferocious killers. The film focuses on one family that goes on the run, trying to survive. Our key characters includes a 16 year old deaf girl, Ally along with her younger brother, grandma and both her parents (played by Stanley Tucci & Miranda Otto).It's impossible to deny that the film's plot and overall concept is extremely similar to other recent films such ""A Quiet Place"" or ""Bird Box"". That being said, I had high hopes for something new here. The creatures and the cast line up alone (especially when you have talent on screen like Stanley Tucci) had me excited.But! The Silence did disappoint me in many ways. The film looks very dull and bland. At one point I also noticed a couple of digital effect issues which were a complete distraction. I even went back to re-watch these scenes in case it was just a ""Netflix glitch"", but no, these scenes had effects that were simply done poorly.Our characters honestly show very little to no compassion. Creatures are trying to kill them and even when someone close to them has died, the family's care factor and facial expressions are way off point. Actor Stanley Tucci is a brilliant actor in my opinion, but here he is simply not used to the best of his abilities and the director behind the camera misses the mark in delivering what should have been critical moments to the film, such as any suspense and heart felt discussions.As for the plot, I won't complain that it's a repeat and nothing new. But the film's rules also don't match up to the characters actions. These creatures murder anything that makes a noise, but yet we have family members who go on Skype to talk or whisper loudly while roaming the streets... I thought there were evil creatures flying around everywhere?...anyway, my mistake.Overall, despite the fact that this film is extremely similar to other films that have recently come out, The Silence is simply dull and uninteresting with an emotionless cast thanks to the director's guidance. As for the film's 3rd act and ending...next please.2.2/10

Even when coming at it with low expectations, it still manages to underperform. The monsters (basically CGI bats) get too much screen time, stripping them of any menace, the characters consistently make maddeningly illogical choices and they introduce a human antagonist in the third leg that's both unnecessary and annoying.

72,TheVictoriousV,Lumped in with The Asylum fare for a reason.,2,15 November 2019,"To give you an idea of what level of filmmaking The Silence is, the first goof listed on IMDb is the premise itself, and what absolute nonsense it is. One gets the feeling that this movie was slapped together just so we could cap the unofficial ""Speak No Evil, See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" trilogy, which also includes last year's A Quiet Place and Bird Box. At least, so I thought at first.A Quiet Place was about creatures that find and kill you if you make noise, ergo being mute is an advantage; ""speak no evil"". Bird Box featured bizarre entities that drive you mad if you look at them, ergo being blind is an advantage; ""see no evil"". It seemed we finally had one for deafness and ""hear no evil"": a film about monsters whose sound kills their prey. Missed opportunity, sez I, because it turns out The Silence is a different, stupider take on A Quiet Place, yet they still use deafness as a plot point - not that it is much of a defense against prehistoric birdies who hunt YOU by YOUR sound.The hearing loss of Ally Andrews (Kiernan Shipka) isn't even that useful to the story. It just serves to explain why she and her family can communicate silently and thus not attract the attention of the Vesps quite as easily as other people. Fat load of good that does when Vesps start swarming the vehicle of Ally's father Hugh (Stanley Tucci) and the grandmother starts coughing up a storm due to cancer (an equally dignified scare involves a ringtone). Shove a character with asthma in there and you should have all the Ailment Clichés down. There's a cute dog too but, well, at least they don't go the clichéd ""disaster movie"" route with it.The rest of the Andrews family consists of Miranda Otto as mommy Kelly and a small boy who was only selected because ""pah, he's just a kid so nobody's gonna care if he can't act very well"". John Corbett plays the best friend of Tucci's character. None of these names are enough of a saving grace in such a tediously, exhaustingly unoriginal movie.One last person worth mentioning is The Reverend, a man who lost his tongue and now leads a ""silent cult"". He's one of those people who appear in films like this because some directors deem monster/disaster movies in need of human bad guys.I am not fluent in American Sign Language, but as I mentioned the act of ""not giving a crap"" with regards to the casting, I'll be extra harsh by paraphrasing deaf actor Nyle Dimarco, who claims that Shipka's ALS grammar is rather flawed and doesn't justify the casting of her over someone who genuinely experiences deafness. ASL is another thing that A Quiet Place did better, I guess, along with its more clever and apt use of sound editing. I don't want to keep bringing it up, but The Silence forces me to.Quartz Magazine even went so far as lumping this film in with ""mockbusters"", i.e. hastily made knock-offs of famous films made exclusively to confuse buyers in the video store (or users of the streaming service in this case), often produced by companies like The Asylum and Video Brinquedo. Not fair? Well, apparently one of the writers of The Silence has worked on several Asylum projects, such as Paranormal Entity and The Day the Earth Stopped.I don't know what the budget was compared to a garden-variety Asylum picture, but the Vesps aren't much to look at, even if they're technically superior to the Sharknado sharks. It's always strange when films like this opt out of the ""less is more"" principle of leaving the monsters to our imagination, which can be very effective. These beasts are not ready for their close-up.Tucci has his moments, there are one or two tense sequences, and something terrible happens to a baby one time - those are my positives.

83,RhapsodyReviews,Boring Story.,4,30 October 2019,"Review:
'The Silence' is a horror film directed by John R. Leonetti. It is based on the novel of the same name by Tim Lebbon.
Unfortunately, I went into this movie expecting it not to be good. The story is one we've seen multiple times already and none of the plot adds anything new. This is a movie you can waste a bored afternoon watching, but there's far better ones out there.
The movie follows a family seeking refuge after a flock of unknown creatures are released from a cave and starts hunting human via soundwaves that are created when people walk or even speak. Finding out about a safe zone they must get to it while fighting obstacles in their way.
I was surprised with how much I liked the acting in this movie. The were a lot of unknowns to be aside from Stanley Tucci and John Corbett, but everybody was great. I've always enjoyed Stanley Tucci in his side character roles, and it was nice to see that he can step up and be a leading man too.
The biggest fault of the movie is that the story that is trying to be told is boring. Choosing to focus on a family trying to get from point A to point B is fine, I could be behind that. Make it entertain along the way, with more stakes than what is involved. Also, if the movie is going to tell its audience that the characters involved need to be quiet, keep it that way. There were so many times where the characters we're watching are watching a lot of noise and nothing happens with the creatures and it was annoying.
Overall, this is a decent enough time killer. It's got a good cast, and some wonderful music and scenes. The problem is the story as a whole.

86,PCT1970,Creature Double Feature If You've Got Nothing Better To Do,5,19 May 2019,"Leonetti helms an ample horror film. The film has adequate direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. This film reminded me of a good old fashion Saturday morning creature double feature when I had a few hours to be entertained before going outside. The film is like ""Pitch Black"" meets ""The Birds"" The entire cast deliver tolerable portrayals of petrified characters. The plot revolves around flying creatures known as Vesps that hunt their prey based on sound. The Vesps are accidentally released from a deep cavern in the Appalachian Mountains. A family is introduced which includes a daughter named Ally who is deaf and has a heightened sense of everything that is happening around her. Her father Hugh tells her it is a gift. Through the news the family learns that there is a state of emergency issued due to the Vesps having an appetite for humans. Through social media they learn that the key to survival is silence. The Vesps are soon spreading throughout the entire Eastern Seaboard. The family flees the area and soon has their first encounter with the creatures. This encounter teaches them how to avoid becoming a main course with the sacrifice of a family member. The family seeks refuge at a ranch but in the process the mother, Kelly, suffers an injury from a Vesp attack which leads to a life threatening infection. This forces Hugh and Ally to venture out for antibiotics and they stumble across a deserted town. There they encounter a mysterious man known as The Reverend. He writes in a book inviting Hugh and Ally to join his flock. Hugh and Ally are not interested and return to the ranch. The Reverend shows up again with his flock of maybe six? He must not be a convincing prophet. Anyway, he offers the family an opportunity to join him one more time which they refuse. Ally learns through the limited communication that still exist that the Vesps do not thrive in desolate areas with no power and cold temperatures. The Reverend returns to kidnap Ally and a battle ensues. The plot is droll, daft, flawed, passable, lethargic and has a less than cathartic ending. This film is meant to be entertaining with the intention of evoking some chills and jolts. If there are any worldly themes meant to be conveyed this viewer didn't catch them other than humans having the ability to adapt. There are a few thrilling scenes but none of which are hair-raising, spine-tingling or will cause sleepless nights. I'm on the fence whether to like or dislike this film. I'm going with dislike for two reasons. First, there is much better content available right now that delivers horrific and nightmarish chills. Secondly, just because the film was nostalgic for this viewer does not mean it was time well spent. I could have been revisiting, ""Stranger Things"" in preparation for the next season in July. As a note I have reviewed several hundred films / series on three major sites. Becoming exceptional at one's passion is a learning process. One lesson I learned is to not compare two works directly, even if the premise is the same. Whose to say a viewer might not enjoy or gather insight from one film as opposed to the other and vice versa. This is why you will never read a 'Must Watch' or 'Don't See' in my reviews. I leave that up to the reader to decide as it is a matter of opinion which is what a review is essentially. Again that's just my opinion.",The Silence

89,RogerBorg,Netflix does a SyFy creature feature,3,11 April 2019,"Granted, you may have heard of two, possibly even three of the cast of this one, but the recipe is exactly the same: take some has-been and never-were actors, cobble together a by-the-numbers screenplay, and leave in a warm place to rise before filming in Film School 101 mid range shots either at night or in a forest to hide the lack of budget. Sprinkle some dreadful CGI and serve tepid.Except this falls flatter even than most SyFy efforts. Tucci is a decent enough actor, but he's pushing 60 and looks more ready to play Thrift Store Hermione's grandfather. Miranda Otto, well, she's of a quality on par with the rest of the production. Kate Trotter is only 14 years older than Otto: that's a mother/daughter age difference that you'd normally only see in porn.To be fair, they all make an attempt to take their roles seriously, but needn't bother because the creatures are just dire. It makes no sense why there are so many of them, and they're about as threatening as blind featherless ducks. The directing is shoddy too, as emotions of fear and grief aren't carried over from scene to scene - there's no sense of loss or building terror.The gimmick of having a deaf character plays out poorly. Thrift Store Hermione delivers her first couple of lines as though she were retarded rather than deaf, then just doesn't bother after that. The signing between the characters is quite literally virtue signalling, ironic given that they cast a hearing actor in a deaf role.Without subtitles (or probably even with them, to be honest) those sections are so dull to watch that I just skipped over them.

Looking at this kind of story I think it's a good one, but please notice that the more the idea becomes used, the more it becomes inflationated. Just think on the 'Saw' series or the bodysnatcher-franchise. With every movie it became worse. On the other hand I really believe in the original and appreciate the sequel of 'A Quiet Place' which might continue the story in a (maybe) interesting and (hopefully) developing way. 'The Silence' is ok. I would not specially recommend it, but if you want to see it, watch it before 'A Quiet Place', the other way round, I would guess that you could get slightly dissapointed about it.",The Silence

I'd have cut out the constant strange undertones of saying okay or nodding his head by the lead Stanley Tucci who annoyed me somewhat with his performance, plus some of the acting from the other characters were weak and unskilled. The film kept losing pace and that tension because some moments were too poorly executed. For the very fact they made the effort and delivered a fairly tense film actually to me I'll hand this a fair rating it was better than the rating suggest, mostly scored unfairly due to the films competition such as a quiet place - which I liked but I will point out didn't even score that well on this site. People are too judgemental. This film was more than it got credit for albeit cheesy and cheap. Nevertheless this already beat in my view most of Netflix silly releases.",The Silence

The cast is made up of multiple Netflix original stars and the plot is... boring. It takes the Bird Box idea of limiting a sense and making your way to safety but just does it with speaking. It follows the family of a deaf girl so the main characters start with an advantage, yet they still make bad decisions. The characters are just very unlikable and the plot and monsters are not nearly as creative as those in Bird Box.

99,rmmil,Almost impossibly bad,2,1 June 2021,"I'm guessing based on the Netflix-players casting of this film that they must yell out at their studio occasionally ""Hey anyone need a movie?"" because it's all just a mishmash of actors from other Netflix content.Anyway, the acting is actually mostly okay in this film, with some exceptions, as the actors attempt to deal with some of the worst writing and plot holes I've ever witnessed in a movie.So many plot holes!! I'll list some of my favorites here:1) How on Earth would the monsters have such numbers to begin with, even in hibernation? The film alludes to the fact that they consume until there's nothing left, then hibernate, but most would've died off before then.2) No way no how Stanley Tucci strangled a dog of that size to death so easily, and it's just like ""Why you killin me?... Okay, I'll die.""3) Why the heck did that old lady come out and she's just talking and hollering like nothing happened at all, like she completely missed the apocalypse, and then she's like ""Ah! Monsters!"" and immediately dies. It was so ludicrous I actually laughed out loud.4) Why didn't the world's armies just set up a bunch of strategically placed wood chippers? Based on the film it'd be over in about a day or so.5) It's pretty brutally obvious someone copied ""A Quiet Place"" or the script was floating around the same and parts were stolen. Come on, apocalypse film with monsters that hunt by sound and a girl who has a special advantage because she's deaf? What does this sound like, hmm?6) Why is the internet still working so well when society is collapsing? Why is the main girl so concerned about religious zealots killing 1 person when literally millions are dying everywhere due to monsters? Come to think of it...why was this story even covered by the media by then?7) ""Man is the real enemy"" subplot stolen from countless other better films / tv series. Ah, religious wackos who...worship the bats, or something. Original!8) Okay, not a plot hole, but why was John Corbett even in this film? He's there about 7 minutes. I did get a laugh thinking ""Eatin good in the neighborhood!"" When he met his end.Anyway, it's terrible. Maybe so bad it's good at times, hence my 2 stars.

Just make them over grown bats. They do not need to look weird.Cast was great. Kierman Shipka is always fun to watch. She is always cast in interesting creepy roles. I am sure the older she gets, the cooler roles she will get. Stanley Tucci plays her father and is also great. Some of the side cast die in stupid ways though.I almost feel like this would of made a better show. Like give me a season and lets see how it goes.

It's a B horror movie and those are hardly ever good actually they're never good. The only reason to watch films like this are to laugh at how bad and illogical they are. When you approach this film from that angle it's watchable and entertaining.So many folks have pointed out what's wrong with the film already so I'll just point out a few things. The movie is really rushed. It feels like even the producers gave up on this movie and just ended it. It has one of the most out of place endings you can imagine which actually makes it even more amusing to watch.I had problems trying to figure out who the Mom and Grandmother was both actors looked like they were a year apart in age. I could never tell if it was Grandma or the Mom that was getting attacked or in danger.The so called deaf daughter speaks and talks throughout the movie. How deaf is she? The family also talks and barely ever uses sign language. You forget the daughter is supposed to be deaf a majority of the time.This Tucci guy I see people talking about. He was the worst actor in this movie. The emotion he showed in this movie could equate to someone upset at getting cold fries at McDonalds. His friend being stuck in the truck while he was so relaxed and calm when his characters lines were supposed to be the lines of someone panicking was a pretty funny delivery.The movie really only has 4 scenes. Them being stuck in the car, them finding the house and them being stuck in the store, then then fighting the cult. That's the story they built the movie around and they all sound like Walking Dead fillers.All in all this movie isn't Asylum movie bad but it's more like ""90's made for T.V. Movie bad."" It's like on the level of the TV version of I.T. I wouldn't want to see this movie again and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're watching it with friends for a good laugh.

The story starts out interesting enough in the vein of rapture/apocalypse phenomena, and developed the main characters rather well. As we get further in it does drag at some points, and has some contrived emotional aspects spread around its plot, but the well executed creatures come around enough to make things exciting again. The conclusion comes rather abruptly with an ambitious yet scattered forced subplot that doesn't really fit. Overall a very basic story that kept me watching. While it does borrow from a Quiet Place (a much better film), it still delivers decently for the subject matter. I also thought the cgi for the bat creatures was really quite impressive for netflix as far as the close ups went, and it was refreshing to actually SEE them pose a threat to the protagonists unlike in drivel films like bird box. I would like to see netflix continue improving their cgi in the future with their bigger budgets because clearly they can afford it.

I originally wanted subtitles for the sign language but that sort of added to the suspense because I had to watch and see what they were planning. Main gripe is Stanley Tuchi's character did more sign than the deaf girl who was talking while everyone else was being quiet. There was also the problem of the vesps (or whatever they're called) reacting to some sounds but not others and they seemed to see ok.

The premise isn't too bad or too new although some greater plot issues are papered over in very broad strokes, this is kept in place by keeping family front and centre in the story - I thought keeping things a bit smaller in scale regarding the over all arc would have been more traditionally successful however that's not the premise of the book. No great budget here - this would have been ""straight to dvd"" back in the day and a relatively decent enough one at that. A Quiet Place and Bird Box would spring instantly to mind - but this isn't up to their level in budget or viewing. Gives me a more TV Stephen King adaptation vibe.

2) The characters make one poor and uneducated judgement after another.
3) What idea is it that 'dad' supposedly has, when he opts to leave the car? Surely not just throwing a wrench about to prove a point that has been made several times already?
4) Why does 'daughter' have the sound on when chatting with Rob, her being deaf?
5) Checkov's Gun. Anyone? The movie is riddled with objects that are hinted at but never used. Even guns.
6) Why is there a drain pipe where there is no dike and why is it barred?
7) Why is the farm house fenced like a fortress?
8) If the country is collapsing, who runs telecom infrastructure? They seem to have internet absolutely everywhere.
9) Apart from them knowing sign language, what exactly is it that is supposed to make a deaf girl better at being silent?
10) Considering the vespas supposedly navigate by ear, their hearing is remarkably poor. They are able to locate power lines to perch on, but not detect screaming food.
11) For a city slicker, 'dad' is remarkably quick at starting the wood chipper. And why does he not let it keep running? As someone else noted; he could have saved the planet long before it ran out of power.
12) What's with the 'the girl is fertile' thing? Humanity hasn't grown barren. It has become food.
13) Who in their right mind would allow their deaf daughter to walk the dog, alone, in the midst of an apocalypse?This list can be expanded to much higher digits than this, however, there are many movies that suffer from these traits and still work. Why? Because they have redeeming features. What does this one have against it, then?1) Poor or even close to no acting. 'Dad' seems to say 'okay' *a lot*. 'They crusified a man in Mississippi' -'okay'.
2) Amateurish CGI (admittedly the slow motion scene in the rain, is very cool, though). Especially the Range Rover rolling down the slope is tear wrenchingly horrible, closely followed by the explosion shortly after.
3) Scene transitions seem purposeless. Nothing carries a momentum. Things appear to happen out of the blue.
4) The score is... well I don't even remember if there even was one. More like a series of sounds attempting to present some level of eerieness.So, what did it show in terms of redemption? A new take on the suicide belt cliché. A cool slow-mo CGI scene.",The Silence

132,moorek,Acting OK but plot line makes no sense,2,13 April 2019,"I was looking forward to this movie because Miranda Otto was in it although she doesn't have much airtime. Stanley Tucci does his best Stanley Tucci which is always OK. But overall the movie didn't gel for me:DEAFNESS. They say they live in a silent world due to the daughter's deafness. NO they don't. The deaf character might do so and thus the rest have learned sign language (used very limited in the movie) to communicate with ONE person. That's not quiet and we see that as they talk to each other between rooms, have the television on etc.And being deaf does not make you quiet. The world is quiet to you and your living environment might be quiet if it lacks the ambient music or television but you are not necessarily quiet. In fact the few deaf people I've known tend to be slightly nosier than normal. Since you don't hear the cutlery banging together in the drawer then getting a spoon out can be much louder than a person with hearing. In this movie even feet crunching on gravel can alert the creatures so how could a deaf person know they aren't making slightly too much noise when walking? It would be like asking a totally blind person, is this light dim enough or should it be dimmer. They can't tell.It was a similar hook with A QUIET PLACE but at least there we did have a family that really did communicate alot with sign language. In this movie you didn't have the feeling that the actors tried hard to learn it.TIMING. The timing is off in two major ways. The first is the spread of the species. Even assuming there are millions of them (which would be dumb but I'll get to that), they likely wouldn't spread anywhere near this fast. With plenty of food near the release area, they would more slowly expand. Even if groups did spread further afield faster, they would be smaller numbers and easier to control.Secondly the story opens with the news reports of what is happening. Clearly the first time people have heard of this ANYWHERE. That night they decide to leave the city. They drive 24 hours at the very most when they have their accident. They go walking and find the house which is at most the second night after they've left. Otto has been bitten and for fear of infection, after a short period of time, they go into the nearby town for antibiotics. So likely less than a week has gone by. The town is basically deserted. There are bodies in the store with eggs already to hatch. There is a cult developed where they are cutting out their tongues. Really? I'm sure right now I could survive in my house for a week quietly waiting for what I would hope was military intervention. And if I could walk outside as our main characters are doing, I'm sure others would be doing it as well.They get the message of the ""boyfriend"" who is going north to the Refuge. This is after the drugstore incident, maybe the same day. How do they know there is a refuge so soon? How do they know the creatures don't like the cold? Also at the time of year in the movie, those northern areas are still fairly warm even if you go to northern Canada.THE SPECIES. If the show had a supernatural or alien theme then we could have suspended our disbelieve in the creatures. But these are supposed to be an earth evolved species living underground until released. Think that one through as clearly the scriptwriters didn't.*The timeline is too short for this type of evolution.
*Ignoring that then they would have likely lost the ability to fly being in a cave. Bats fly because they hunt flying insects mainly although some have adapted to fruit. Flying in a cave, would likely be very dangerous even with echolocation. And while not elaborated on, the species must have echolocation as they fly blindly through trees etc.
*What would this species be hunting in the cave for thousands of years? They couldn't feed on themselves as they would have died out within a few generations.
*In nature prey limits predators and not vice versa. In low years of prey populations, there is an equally low year in predators although often there is a year lag for the predators. For there to be this many predators escaping the cave then the predator base must have been huge.
*The species has evolved a huge mouth of teeth implying they are consuming large prey. If they were existing on smaller animals then their adaptations would reflect that. So their prey must have been very large.
*The species reproduces by laying eggs in mammalian bodies. There are a few monotreme mammals that lay eggs so this species could be a ""fossil"" type monotreme but it is also semi-parasitic if it requires a mammalian body in which to plant its eggs. What species was the host to its eggs in the cave?THE THREAT. It is a silly premise. These blind creatures are attracted to sound. As we saw with the chipper, they could easily be drawn to things that kill them. Even something as simple as razor wire spread as a dome over a noise generator would bring the creatures flocking in to die on the razor wire.Running any type of noise generator would draw any predators near you away as we see in the movie. Just carry things like bangers, fireworks, flare guns where the initial noise of setting it off would be replaced by a louder noise where the item blasted - usually away from you.Creatures that hunt by sound could easily be distracted by too much noise. We see that happen in the movie with the fire sprinklers and the lightning. It would not be difficult to come up with some mixture of sounds that would just confuse the species so that they'd be open to be killed. It would be like be hunted by a nocturnal animal and no one thinking about using bright lights to scare it off or confuse it.
Also we live in a world of sound. Yes there are quiet days but most days have winds, rustling leaves, etc. Days with thunderstorms, snowstorms etc would likely completely incapacitate the creatures.The threat of these creatures to vehicles (and houses) are primarily the windows. So what has happened to all the armoured military vehicles that could be driving around. They'd quickly learn they were attracting creatures and so would stop and shut down until the creatures left, then get out.SILLY PLOT POINTS. All movies have these but some seem obvious here:
*No one seems to carry weapons to hit the creatures. Sure that would make noise but if they are on you, you should have something.
* In one scene Tucci picks up a tire iron, only to throw it further down the road to lure a creature away when a rock would do that and he could have hit the creature with the tire iron
*deer rush across a road and the driver's reaction is to panic and go off the road.
*Speaking of the road, the lead vehicle said there were bad parts ahead but the road they are on is in very good shape.
*Cults are crazy but cutting out tongues seems a little silly. The noises most people are making are not with their voices but by accidently knocking something over.
*Why would the cult come out of a town, where there must still be survivors, to pursue this family due to a ""fertile"" girl. Again we are only talking maybe 1 week since the whole thing started.
*The cult deserves credit for devising a plan that would have the good guys all rush into the basement where they would be waiting for them. How did they even know of the structure of this house and basement?
*Tucci won't shoot because of the creatures so appear to let the guy walk away with his daughter. One shot might have brought the creatures but they wouldn't know where to hunt unless the preacher was making some pre-dying noises. And after that first visit, just have a pillow taped to the front of the gun to reduce but not eliminate the noise. Create spears. Carry knives. Anything.",The Silence
133,Martinito_08183,I wasn't all that surprised by the results.,3,28 November 2019,"""The Silence"" may not be as bad as everyone is making it out to be, but my god - it is a very flawed movie, which it may not be surprising for many, since it's directed by John R. Leonetti. The man, who is responsible for movies like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, The Butterfly Effect 2, Annabelle, Wolves at the Door and Wish Upon.The story goes as follows: ""The world is under attack from terrifying creatures, who hunt by sound. A teenage girl named Ally Andrews that lost her hearing in a car accident tries to seek refuge alongside with her family, while the only way of communicating with each other is sign language, with some moments of whispering"". If that sounds very familiar, then you might have heard that ""The Silence"" does share almost the same premise with a movie that came out last year and it's called ""A Quiet Place"", but here's the weirdest thing - ""The Silence"" is based on a book that was released back in 2015, so... at least there is something that distinct them from each other, but it will still be compared to ""A Quiet Place"", since it's impossible not to compare it. In my opinion - ""A Quiet Place"" is better, even though i wasn't a huge fan of that movie and at least it did some things that were good, unlike this movie.""The Silence"" is not very well made. It has a story that wasn't all that good in the first place, very average characters, bland dialogue, weak music, awful visual effects, OK cinematography and weak acting. The only things that i liked were the sound, Stanley Tucci's performance, 20% of the shot composition and a scene in the store, where the two main characters have to get antibiotics and that's it. Everything is either poorly made or hilariously bad.The story is where i have many problems. They set up the fact that Ally (the daughter) lost her hearing, so everyone in the family knows sign language, since it's the only way they can communicate with her, but there are some moments that can be very inconsistent. There are moments, where Hugh (Stanley Tucci) is speaking to Ally (Kiernan Shipka) without sign language. He is speaking to her very normally and Ally can still understand him for some reason, even though there are a few moments that the movie did focus in her point of view to prove that she can't hear anything (only loud noise), but she can still hear him in some moments?The movie started off OK (the scene with the bullies is one of the worst moments in the movie) and continues the same way and to be honest - i was starting to get invested into the movie little by little (shocking, right?), but then they introduce ""The Reverend"" and this is where everything went downhill and at that point the movie has become insufferable to watch, even after re-watching it - i wanted to skip everything after that moment, but i didn't and i choose to continue anyway.""The Reverend"" tries to recruit the two main characters in his cult, but unsuccessfully and then in 1 hour and 7 minutes the cult come to the house that the family is now staying and tries again to recruit them and he reveals that he has a interest in Ally's ""fertility"". This is where i was like ""Are you serious? Do they really want to go in that direction?"". From that point there are two ways it can go with that awful idea:
1. The cult will try to kidnap her, while all of the family are at the house and try to protect her.
2. They will successfully kidnap her and the father will go to hunt the cult members, kill the leader in a fight and saving his daughter.
They went with the first way, but with a difference from my prediction. The movie ends in 1 hour and 24 minutes, which means that all of those things happens within the amount of 17 minutes and i'm like ""How can they do all of that stuff in this short amount of time?""Even the idea of how to kidnap Ally is ridiculous. They send a little girl to the front door that has phones strapped to her to be used as a distraction and they place more phones to the house, including upstairs (where Ally is sleeping) on the window outside, so that they can attract the vesps and to attack the family. I have one question: How did they put a phone outside the window upstairs? One of them has to climb to the roof to put a phone with a tape on the window, but he would make so much noise and in that way the vesps will hear him very easily. They do all of those things, so that they wait in the basement, if someone happens to go down there. That plan is stupid, because it would easily kill everyone, including the girl that they send and Ally, who they want to take away. All of this would not have happened, if the family locked the gate of the high fence when they returned with the antibiotics. Before i forget to mention: when ""The Reverend"" shows us that he has no tongue - it's so hilarious. He does that two times and that way he does it is very funny. He even snarls at the main characters and for me that was the cherry on top.So yeah. Those are the complaints that i have with the movie. There are still things that don't work that i didn't mention, but it's better if you see it instead. For me - it barely managed to get a 3/10. It's like it was fighting very hard to get a good rating, but it would start losing and fall on the ground in every minute in a match and trying to get up, but even when he gives his best - he will accept his defeat very early. I'm giving ""The Silence"" a 2.6/10.",The Silence

135,knightox,The Silence of the Lame,3,24 October 2019,"First off, if you like ""REALISM"" do not think about watching this movie. It seems like every other scene has another plot hole in it. From the idea that hundreds of thousands of small, voracious, flying carnivores could be waiting to come surging out of a small crack in the earth to wipe most of America's population in a few days to humanity's unbelievable inability to deal with them is preposterous. What have all these creatures been feeding on all this time?!? Also, yeah sure they're blind as ""bats"" but they don't have a sense of smell?
Moving on. The acting is mediocre but the directors sure do have the family portrayed as having little common sense. Things like posting guards, closing doors behind them and bringing plenty of water, food, medicine from home and weapons from Glen's SUV just didn't seem important to them. They did bring a pair of binoculars but I think Stanley Tucci looked through them backwards in the scene!
There are some unintentional funny moments such as the cult leader trying to make a scary face with his tongue cut out and coming across as an absolute MORON! lol! Plus dozens of the bird-brained vespers taking a swan dive into a wood chipper! Yeah those are pretty much the high points of this film.

They act like piranhas, reproduce like rabbits, and hunt by targeting things that make noise.The story revolves around a family where the daughter is deaf, so they all know how to speak in sign language and don't necessarily need to make noise to communicate. That's my favorite part of this movie, really. It's an interesting gimmick, even though it's kind of artificial since the so-called deaf girl just talks half the time just to save the audience from having to read subtitles and she never sounds deaf when she talks.The gay guy from The Devil Wears Prada is the father and he gives a strong performance.They shoehorn a second plot near the end of the movie for no reason. I heard this movie was based on a book so maybe they just wanted to cover all the main points of the book. It's short, pointless, and campy.And yes, the whole movie is a camp-fest. It's very dumb, illogical, and has huge plot holes. Still, it's entertaining and endearing as a disaster movie and it was very interesting to see sign language play such a central role in a movie. Reminds me of that movie that used Esperanto.Honourable Mentions: The Land Before Time (1988). Prominently features a pterodactyl character. This one is friendly, though.

The story follows a family tiring to survive.There is little original or interesting about this film other than the fairly good acting.

Not only is the film an inert pastiche of countless post-apocalyptic dramas, most notably last year's A Quiet Place, but even Netflix's own Bird Box feels like a master class in tension building and nuanced storytelling in comparison. Perhaps the biggest similarity the film shares with Bird Box is the desire to close your eyes, but for two very different reasons.As part of the film's commitment to unoriginality, The Silence follows a group of killer bat-like creatures that have escaped from the bowels of hell (or a vast underground cave system, take your pick) to reap havoc above Earth. Hunting only by sound (despite the fact that the bats don't shut the hell up), within hours America has been reduced into a post-apocalyptic landscape, with the army and military conspicuously absent from every scene.Amongst the carnage, a family, led by Stanley Tucci who plays a father to a deaf daughter (played by Kiernan Shipka), must do want they can to survive, which mostly means moving around a lot and never thinking of bordering up the doors or windows of their house. In one scene, the daughter literally leaves the door wide open as she enters a store looking for supplies. Oh and there's a crazed cult randomly inserted into the film's climactic moments in case the story wasn't rushed enough already.It's a bargain bin version of Hitchcock's The Birds, if the bargain bin were made from reused materials sourced from a smouldering car wreck. However, if you're still keen on watching The Silence, prepare yourself for a challenging mystery as trying to figure out what attracted Stanley Tucci to this mess in the first place is a real head scratcher.",The Silence

176,fishwhisperer-31845,Why?,7,25 May 2020,"Why, if the main character is deaf, does she speak through the whole movie? Her family signs more than she does! Did the actress not know how to sign? Also, she reacted in a lot of scenes like she could hear. If there was some reasoning for all this, they should have touched on it.
Also, I did question how quickly the sex cult came into being after the beasts showed up. Seemed to happen pretty quick. Gove the human race SOME credit.
Aside from that, I really enjoyed this movie. It seemed well written, and I really liked the storyline. I personally would have liked this better as a show than a movie. It ended too abruptly for my taste.

Now for the bad stuff. For a family ""used to living in silence"" they seem to find it extremely difficult to live in silence. By day 2 it would appear that the government or any authority are not making much of an attempt at killing the creatures. Religious nuts wanting your daughters seems to happen remarkably quickly. Then apparently the only way to survive these quite easy to kill creatures is to head north cause they don't like to be cold.

179,timrossminister,"Shhh, try not to laugh or they might get you.",4,18 February 2020,"I'll save the spoilers until the next paragraph - although they will hardly ruin the film for you. From the outset, there are too many aspects of this film which just haven't been thought through. It's as though the writers had one idea, rushed to write the script and sell it to the movie company and all the while nobody looked to see whether it made sense. Consequently, any sense of jeopardy, horror and tension is completely dispelled by plot holes. Give this one a miss or better yet, watch Birdbox, which is infinitely better. The one bright spot in the film is Miranda Otto, whose performance is wonderful.
Here are the spoilers.
Creatures (really bad CGI creatures) which have been sealed up for thousands of years find their way into the word to devour the human race. Ummm... what were they devouring before they got out? Then, suddenly, from one cave, there are enough to cover the entire USA - that's a BIG cave! So, let's send in the US air force... to do what exactly? They're about the size of fruit bats. And, by the way, where are the army with their armoured cars, and the national guard with flame throwers and the marines and the state troopers and...?
And if hearing is their only sense, which can enable them to navigate through woodland without hitting a single branch, why can they not 'see' human beings just because they aren't making any noise? And what are their noses for? And why has nobody thought of starting a disco to attract them all and then blowing them all up? And why don't they just wait for a thunderstorm and then kill them all? And...
Poor old USA - it is doomed to fall into a post-apocalyptic decline (where you can still somehow get broadband in a cabin in the middle of the woods), whilst the rest of the world carries on going to Tesco for their shopping and watching really badly made 'horror' films on Netflix, one presumes.",The Silence

Even their hearing isn't really good since they can't hear people walking or speaking in a low voice. The only thing they are good at is reproduction, in just a few days, a cave full of rabid bats managed to take over the entire east cost and more.
Also, in just a few days, a crazy cult is formed that cuts their tongues and kidnaps fertile young girls.
After most of the people have been eaten or used as nests for creature eggs, somehow the internet still works and so do phones.

183,warren-87235,A reasonable Netflix time-passer at best,6,12 April 2019,"'The Silence' is a disappointing little film, that could have been far more interesting. There are obvious similarities to 'A Quiet Place', which came first as a film, yet 'The Silence' is in turn based on a book that came first (How accurate an adaptation, I'm not sure). So for now, let's just judge 'The Silence' on its own merits.There seems to be small trend at the moment for apocalyptic movies that rely on a threat involving a specific sense. Ergo 'A Quiet Place' and 'The Silence' go for sound, whilst 'Birdbox' went for sight. I'm happy to say that 'The Silence' is at least an improvement over the predictable and annoying 'Birdbox'. Having said that, it has a few too many flaws of its own.What is the general plot? A family try to make their way to safety during the start of an apocalyptic disaster involving piranha-like flying monsters, overcoming various obstacles on the way. The family consists of a father and mother, a grandmother, and two children: a young son, and a teenage daughter who is deaf. Disappointingly, the daughter's deafness never really serves much purpose to the plot, other than the family's use of sign language (see 'A Quiet Place' for dealing with both the potential advantages and disadvantages of a deaf character in this situation, far more effectively). Along for the (start of) the ride, is also the father's best friend.The film starts off well. I enjoyed the fact that it didn't fall into too many predictable character clichés (initially). It was interesting to see that Stanley Tucci's father character had a reliable and trust-worthy best friend who was helping them out. There was no forced conflict between them. Likewise, there were no marital problems to be overcome between Tucci and Miranda Otto, who plays the mother. The children were fairly bland, but also not overly annoying and obnoxious. The shame is that none of the characters were particularly interesting, either.The film's premise uses a dash of 'Reign of Fire', with underground beasts being released to plague the world. The creatures are rather fun, and the effects are good quality, I have no complaints there. What falls over is the logic. Where, for example, 'Reign of Fire' works, is that it explains how the dragons very quickly multiply upon escape, yet still take a few off-screen years to put the world into its post-apocalyptic state. 'The Silence' expects us to believe that so many of these creatures escaped from a single cave system (however large) and within days are putting America (and with some vague implication the rest of the world? It's not really clear) into full-on end-of-the-world mode. Still, if we accept this conceit, it wouldn't have ruined the movie.The family are trying to escape to somewhere more isolated and/or defensible, yet in the end are in a position that is no better than if they had stayed safely ensconced in their own home, until they discovered the safe destination of the cold north.I also can't fail to mention one fun moment, that also undermines the threat of the flying beasts... Stanley Tucci uses a woodchipper, which noisily draws in a host of the creatures, that are promptly crunched into oblivion. Whilst fun, this leaves the viewer feeling that each town would be perfectly safe if they simply set up wood chippers at regular intervals, and before you know it, the monsters would be extinct!Even then, that wouldn't have written the film off... The final straw is the mind-numbingly idiotic 'psycho religious fanatics' trope, that seems to pervade such stories. This can sometimes work, if handled correctly, but in this case, we're expected to believe that within a couple of days, a fanatical cult has formed in the nearby town, wants to force the family to join them, and is already on the hunt for fertile females to perpetuate the species. This is unequivocally the most facepalm-inducing plot device, and felt like an excuse to draw out the running time because the didn't know what else to do. Society hasn't even completely collapsed at this point, as the internet is occasionally still available, and CNN is occasionally still functional.Are we to seriously believe that within a couple of days of a disastrous event, where people are still struggling to survive against thousands of killer monsters, that a small fanatical cult has formed and really cares so much about capturing a young girl for breeding? It's the kind of thing that might work if they implied this was at least several years after the disaster, and your imagination can go wild with what may have risen in the aftermath. As it is, it would be as idiotic as telling the story of 'Mad Max: Fury Road', in the time frame of the first 'Mad Max', when society hadn't yet fully collapsed!So how to sum up 'The Silence'? It starts with a little potential, turns mediocre, then becomes utterly stupid. The eventual ending, minus the fanatics, is serviceable and at least doesn't fall into the pointless trap of ""..and they all died. The end"". What we're left with is some reasonable acting and direction, not much tension, a fun premise, and some nice effects. Given those, I'll be generous and give it a 6 out of 10. At the end of the day, though, just watch the vastly superior 'A Quiet Place'.",The Silence

Secondly, the pterodactyl-like creatures here seem more believable than Quiet's spider-aliens.

And already now (and I'm just 50% into the novel) I'm angered by the changes.Why did they have to shift the story location to the US? It's so much creepier when the Vesps are set free in Moldova and the protagonists follow the events mostly through TV and Internet from the UK, while the danger moves closer, wiping out one European city after another, country after country.And while the movie is very streamlined and stereotyped to fit common horror clichés, thereby creating a lot of unlogical situations, the book explains everything way better and it actually makes sense.So does the handling of the situation by the main characters and the way the act and try to escape/survive.I still give it 6 stars, because for the first 70 minutes it was entertaining and it had its moments.

224,ashleighabsurd,Liked it a lot more than expected,9,11 April 2019,"I like that this film started with showing how the creatures came into the world and left the audience wondering what life was like under the cave that was hidden away from the world as well as what other creatures could be living down there or if they were the only ones. I also liked how the creatures seemed like bats with how they moved and how they looked which showed how the evolution of them came into being and made the creatures seem more terrifying as a result. Having one of the children being deaf was something I thought was a good change as it showed how the family were better equipped to survive as they were able to do sign language to each other and didn't have to speak which helped them to stay alive. Having the small cult who cut their tongues out in order to not speak was something that was a good addition as it showed how other people were surviving and that not everyone was able to do sign language so they were writing on pads of paper. By having them also want the daughter because she was fertile did scare me a little and how they would do anything to have her including getting the monsters to try and kill the family so she would have no option but to go with them. This did make me scared of them and wonder who else they had done this to in order to gain more members. The ending was something else I liked with seeing how people were going to be able to survive by living in the north where it was colder as the monsters were unable to survive, this gave me hope for the human race although upon the family arriving at the refuge it did make me hope that maybe there would be a second movie.The only thing about this film in which I could call as a negative is due to the family whispering and dong sign language and not always doing this there was parts of the movie in which I didn't understand what they were saying to each other which I wish I did. However, this didn't take away from the movie too much for me. I also thought that the story for this film had been done before but still kept me on the edge of my seat.",The Silence

226,gatsby601,Dumb Characters Looking to Die,3,13 April 2019,"The Silence stars Stanley Tucci (what, really?) and some other people in another apocalyptic thriller about evil beasties wiping us pretty much out. And yes, these beasties, flying bat things or something, can only hunt based on hearing and yes, that is enough to somehow make them a viable threat. But anyway, the story.A family leaves the comfort and safety of their well appointed home to wonder the byways of America as cities begin to fall to large swarms of apparently fairly lethal bat/bird things. After witnessing first hand how nasty the bat/bird things can be the group decides for no obvious reason to abandon the comfort and safety of their well appointed mini van and continue wondering on foot. With a sick grandmother in tow. The rest of the film follows this pattern of ridiculously stupid decisions being rewarded with unbelievably lucky results. Why? because there isn't enough story here so the writers had to keep coming up with new ways of putting the Tucci clan in jeopardy which is why it never occurred to anyone to maybe lock the gate if you don't want the pervy preacher coming around anymore.Slow and shamelessly stealing from other films - not just A Quiet Place - The Silence is as lazy as it is dull. Characters plod along without really seeming all that worried and the let's face it, when you have to introduce a second villain late in the third act it might be telling you the plot is all out of ideas.Stanley Tucci deserves better and so do we.",The Silence
227,martinmcdonough,Not a very good film,3,16 July 2019,"I watched this movie because I saw that Stanley Tucci was in it and, much like Jeff Bridges, he really doesn't appear in too many bad films and even those, for the most part, are watchable if not memorable.This movie, however, was a mess. And not in a good way.Not sure where to begin, so I'll start with the Vespas. Their existence defies any pretext of reality. No species could have survived for millions of years (as it was said in the movie) with no food supply. Evolutionary hypothesis be damned. Unless they were cannibalistic (which they are not) they would have died out a long, long, long time ago. I know the opening credits show industrial waste, pollution, nuclear explosions and such to possibly give an explanation as to their mutations and existence, but the fact of the matter is that those phenomenon are only developments since the industrial revolution, which doesn't provide enough time to mutate these creatures.The family and backstory is typical. Mom, dad, kids, grandparent, and a dog, and all the typical trappings that come with their respective ages. Then the Vespas are released and everything goes haywire.But I have to come back to the fact that the time involved doesn't add up. That's the biggest issue for me. The Vespas are released and almost INSTANTLY four states' population succumbs and are semi-quarantined - within 24-48 hours. Think about that for a minute. Four states (PA,NY,NJ and MA) is a HUGE area. Unless there were about a BILLION of these creatures trapped in that cave, it just can't happen that fast. And the fact that a cult pops up in that same time frame that (1) has figured out to be quiet (2) needs ""fertile"" girls to perpetuate the cult and (3) has coordinated itself to have membership that blindly follows their leader to kidnap and murder - all within 48 hours - just doesn't add up.Then there's other issues - the ""compound"" that is guarded by the lady but has an unlocked storm drain big enough to crawl through and grant access to the property; the wood chipper that attracts - and kills - the Vespas but that info seems to never be shared with anyone; the predictable deaths of Uncle Glenn and the heroic grandmother (Dante's Peak, anyone?); the seeming willingness to accept the situation and trek north to the cold rather than devise and implement a widespread solution (woodchippers, anyone?)....It's just bad. Stanley Tucci couldn't save this movie. Stanley Kubrick couldn't save this movie. And without good writing, no one could have saved this movie. Too many holes, too short a timeframe to jam everything in and just lazy writing.",The Silence

233,ReaLMoisan,Major Issue with the Big Bad.,3,17 December 2019,"How do blind creatures navigate and hunt without other sensory information? Bats have eyesight and are not blind as some people suspect, in fact, in low light conditions they can see better than humans. They also have the best hearing in the mammal kingdom, and would be able to hunt humans by the sound of our breathing alone. They also have echolocation to hunt and navigate that's so acute they can sense objects measured in fractions of a millimetre. Sure there are blind species of animals, but they all rely on some other sensory information to hunt and navigate. Also, there is no blind species of animal capable of flight for good reason. There are moles that use tendrils and smell, with their tendrils being the most touch sensitive organ in the animal kingdom. There are fish and salamanders that use water pressure, smell, and hearing. There are spiders that can sense with fine trichobothria hairs on their legs to feel, and sense chemicals on the ground left by prey they've specialized to hunt. There are crab, crayfish, and shrimp that use antennae to smell, touch, and taste when they graze. There are jellyfish and sea urchins that can sense light without having eye organs to perceive light. The creatures in the movie A quite Place used some form of echolocation to hunt and navigate similar to bats. Though, it seems far less effective and acute.The creatures in this movie have no extrasensory organs to navigate and hunt besides sound. Which means they need to hear prey to locate it. You know what doesn't make noise? Cave walls, floors, ceilings, stalactites and stalagmites. Same goes for trees, the ground, houses, etc. How do they find the power lines to perch on them? What's stopping them from flying directly into the earth? Nothing. Not only is it preposterous to believe this species could ever successfully evolve, but they surely wouldn't have a chance against humans. I had to pause the movie because my mind was racing with all the possible ways I could kill, trap, lure, detour, and avoid these things with only what I have in my home right now. I came up with dozens of solutions, and none of them would even put me in danger of these useless predators. I won't even get into any other aspects of the movie, because the antagonist, threat, and plot relies on a ridiculous premise that makes the movie impossible to take seriously.",The Silence

Back in the 70's every 'hit' movie spawned a slew of similar-genre films...all usually tepid, mediocre outings. 'The Silence' is no different. Designed to ride upon the success of 'Bird Box' and (to a lesser extent) 'A Quiet Place', 'The Silence' fails. From unlikeable characters (father, who is bullied-boy all grown up...'What's that?' he asks his friend...as if he doesn't know what a hand gun is) to the annoying, screaming grandmother, 'The Silence' doesn't take all that long to get going, but the creatures don't make much of any appearances, preferring to follow the story from the deaf-girl protaganist's perspective.

236,Christina-Q,It didn't make much (if any) sense,2,21 April 2019,"I thought the idea sounded great: be quiet and survive. But great idea alone doesn't make a great movie. The plot raised too many unanswered questions and makes you wonder what the writers were thinking, because the story has just too many WTF-moments.First of all it seemed odd that the family decided to leave home, where they had food and all the other stuff, so they could survive better. And they didn't even seem to have a clear plan why leave the house and what to do next. Why not wait for the army/police/whoever to give more instructions?The creatures weren't scary and it seemed it wasn't that hard to kill them, because they were small, blind and attracted to sound. And even the dad was able to kill few of them without any training, so why didn't the army etc step in?The most weird thing was definitely this not-so-creepy cult leader and his herd. It wasn't explained why the cult was formed and what was their point? And how could they save the others, if they joined them? Why they were so special? And why, oh why they said the girl is fertile? Because it had nothing to do with the bigger image. Nothing.Then the mother got bitten, and of course every infection is cured, if only they can find antibiotics. And even when they are in a strange town, they just somehow knew that you can enter the pharmacy from the back door, if the front door is shut. How did they know?And the ending was just...

The acting is OK at best, the visual effects are OK at best, and possibly bad at least once (a car exploding).The things that disagrees the most with me regarding this movie, are:What kind of numbers of vespas lived in the cave so that they were many enough to more or less cover large parts of USA?!What kind of food source lived in the cave that were sufficient to feed that huge number of vespas through millions of years in isolation?!Instead of fortifying the house they are in and/or go down in the basement/go to a bomb shelter, the family chooses to leave the house in cars with no real destination!When finding a house with a high wire mesh fence surrounding the house and with bells on the locked gate as an alarm, a pipe large enough for most people to crawl through between the inside and outside of the property is practically open for trespassers!The family with a deaf girl agrees relatively early on in the movie to stay silent and use sign language so that they do not attract the monsters. They then continue talking a lot throughout the rest of movie!In one scene the father chooses to risk his life and leave the car with a lot of deadly monsters in the vicinity. Seemingly to just check/demonstrate that the monsters are attracted to sound, as they already knew!It is demonstrated by the father that the vespas is attracted to sound and flies blindly into a wood chipper.

The behaviour of the deaf girl is unrealistic, even given the inference that she might have some slight hearing. She does not act like someone profoundly deaf. You have to assume she acquired the impairment somehow after she learned how to speak, because her annunciation is too spot-on for someone born deaf.

Don't even tell me this was based on a book. I call BS. Maybe the concept of sound-aggressive demon birds was derived from a book, but the rest was utter slop.",The Silence

Then you check the time and realize there's only like 20 minutes remaining and start to wonder how the heck they'll wrap everything up before the end credits start rolling. The answer is very simple: they hurry up and squash every plot resolution in the last two sequences.
It's a shame because a number of storylines deserved a better development (how they handled the whole Flock of the Hushed affair was borderline criminal) but the authors decided to focus on family interactions instead. Comprehensible, but disappointing.",The Silence

272,martyncymro,Story of Family Survival,6,13 April 2019,"Some reviewers need to be better informed before they put pen to paper. 'The Silence' is the film of a book, with the same name, written by British writer, Tim Lebbon, and published in April 2015. It therefore predates 'A Quiet Place', and is not a copy of it. The screenplay for the latter film was written by Bryan Woods in 2018, who came up with the story in the same year. One could reasonable argue that Woods stole the idea for 'A Quiet Place' from 'The Silence'
That said, 'The Silence' is an enjoyable film of survival in a hostile world created by the appearance of creatures which hunt by sound and which were long entombed in cave. The actors performed well and the direction was good. It's failing was to give too much viewing time to the creatures, a factor which 'A Quiet Place' did not and which, in my opinion, added to the horror of the situation. That said, 'The Silence' is definitely worth a watch.",The Silence

A flame thrower would do the trick, or an electric suit, or a tesla coil gun which arcs with nearby living flesh, hmm, let's see what about the most obvious of all??? Hmm did it cross your mind? Nope? What about a noise weapon? You capture one of those bats you put it into a lab and you test different noise frequencies until you find the right noise frequency which will annoy the wasp and keep it away or make its head blow. Microwave guns would also do the trick, all you need is a magnetron and a battery pack and these things wouldn't come anywhere near you. Also the military would be impossible to beat. How could these things ever beat a tank? All they could do is smash through windows but never through heavy armored tanks. The movie was also heavily anti-Christian, it portrayed them as a bunch of cavemen savages only interesting in crucifying others and abducting girls for ""fertility"". Yes cause that's the Christian way, child abductions and crucifying people.... What a mess of a movie. Unless you have just 1 single brain cell alive, then its impossible to like this movie. Yet another Netflix fail. These guys should quit making movies or hire me, I would make them more intelligent, HIGH IQ and people would enjoy them. The first thing about a movie that turns me off is lack of intelligence and this movie has none but I watched it entirely out of curiosity. Tell you what, even a simple 1500's knights armor would protect you from these things. You would be invincible. If 50 wasp bats would swarm you and they still won't be able to pierce a good knight armor. They could however eat you in a modern armor which only protects the chest area (its only a vest) but a knight armor covers you entirely, you are 100% protected in metal.

283,dermacora1,Wasted Potential,3,10 April 2019,"The Silence is a film about a family of city dwellers that has little to no survival skills in a SHTF scenario. Even though they manage to muddle their way through various dangers, their foolishness, lack of experience and preparedness is aggravating. We've been told this kind of story (to this extreme) many times before. In addition, there are many scenarios in this film that don't make sense, even in the context mentioned before. Without revealing any spoilers, we see them not closing doors behind them, discarding tools, failing to retrieve weapons, not setting a night watch, using a noisy main gate instead of crawling back through a drainage pipe after the danger had been removed, and falling for a *painfully* obvious ruse that literally anyone should have been able to see through.
Personally I feel like this film was rushed through the production process and would have been better off as a series or mini-series. There was SO much potential in the idea behind this film and 90% of it was omitted or completely wasted. Given how the story was told the family's personal perspective, there's still room for a spin-off series that would better explain how this whole thing began (we know how it began, but it could be vastly expanded on), how officials handled the events overall, how the rest of the world fared and to expand on a virtual gold-mine of other creative ideas that could be explored.",The Silence

What does deafness have to do with navigating the world in silence? She's oblivious to the only thing these creatures are sensitive to.
I swear the more serious bits were funny especially the part where they just wait for the creatures to attack that old woman casually move into her house. No supplies or food either, eh?This movie took all tropes it could muster and stuffed them into one movie. The best way to watch this movie is on mute and while you're looking something up on your phone.",The Silence
286,bhaskarulichi,A Decent film that doesn't deserve the hate it's receiving......,6,19 May 2020,"If you are a fan of Survival films and if you find the storyline interesting, then this film is worth watching. Why I say so is that the only thing that prevents you from ever watching this film is....negative reviews.
Those who rated this <6 stars may have focused on the flawed premise Or simply they might have watched a ton of similar films. But I personally feel that there is absolutely no reason that you could hate this film.Many people may feel that the creatures are not as haunting as they are supposed to be. However, I personally feel that it's quite okay as we are shown from a perspective of a normal family. For a cinematic experience, we need a huge monster to feel the horror, but in reality, we can't even face a stray dog. So, it's convincing enough that a normal person can't protect himself when a couple of flesh eating bat like creatures prey on him. Not everytime the scenario need to be like "" The end of the world"". Here, it's more like protecting the family until the situation comes under control. So, this is more like a survival film rather than a post apocalyptic film.
The premise is similar to ""A Quite Place"" which I had rated 1/10. So what makes this different from A Quite Place?
The difference is that, from the beginning of the film, you seem to care more about the characters.
Not much time was taken to develop the characters but you would fall in love with them, especially the deaf daughter & the Grandma. What makes this film a decent one was that the characters behave rationally unlike in quiet place. This makes you ignore all the plot holes and anomalies in the premise. Instead we tend to care more for the characters.
The only problem with the film is the unnecessary introduction of a mysterious cult which was okay but doesn't add much to the film. Could've worked if it's a TV Series spanning multiple seasons. Instead the makers should've shown more about the family's journey to their ultimate survival.In Quiet Place, the characters behave so ludicrously that they infact become a threat to their own family. It was quite evident when their little son dies in the opening sequence. I blame it on all other family members.
Father...for keeping the batteries within the reach of the kid, Sister...for giving the toy, both the parents... for leaving behind the youngest member of the family ( a 3 year old, I guess) in such a life threatening scenario. In addition to this, choosing to have a baby again and leaving a nail on the staircase etc..makes it absolutely disgusting to watch.
Whereas, in The Silence, each character cares for one another..
Stanley Tucci, the father...Does everything he could to save his family. Even killing the dog which is actually a threat to the family.
Uncle Glenn... Tries his best to lead his best friend's family (Tucci's)) to safety and threatens Tucci to leave him and take care of his family after meeting with a tragic accident.
Daughter... I'm totally in love with her for no reason at all. Though she's deaf, she exhibits an incredible presence of mind throughout the film. Infact, she's the one who finds out the ultimate path to survival.
Son... Doesn't have much to do but still adorable.
Grandma: the most lovable character in the film. When she comes to know that she's a threat to her daughter's family, she wants to sacrifice herself. She cares for her daughter so much that one would see their own mom in her. Ultimately, she sacrifices herself for her grand daughter when the cult wants to abduct her.
Mom....her relation with the Grandma is beautiful.
So that's what makes this film worth watching for...A family who cares for each other.The only reason why I write this review is that I personally feel so bad for the makers when critics and audiences hail a ridiculous film like ""A Quiet Place"" made with a huge budget and pan a decent film like this.",The Silence

I dunno .... sitting around for a couple million years waiting for someone to blast a hole in the cave wall and let them out? I can actually get beyond the obvious question of ""What were they eating for all those years?,"" but this movie fails to take advantage of my bludgeoning of disbelief and just goes down hill from there.Now, I'm all for a good creature flick, but the onslaught of stupid pouring out of this movie is really hard to stomach. Are today's audiences *that* incredibly vacuous? There are so many glaring details that are flat out wrong (rattlesnakes crawling around in Fall? Sure. 39 Rounds from a Baretta Model 92? Why not. Car side windows spiderwebbing instead of shattering like tempered glass does? Absolutely ... etc. etc. etc). Somehow, the creatures can hone in on a small bell dingling from 1000 feet overhead, but 5 city-dwellers trudging through the woods is somehow ghostly silent .... in the Fall. Right. I don't know what the challenge is with getting details right in Hollywood, but it would have helped the movie tremendously. When the deaf daughter says, ""I know how to live in silence"" - I about fell over. Somehow the fact that she's deaf makes her super-quiet? What?Then, there's the Standard-Issue agenda that seems to creep into every movie put out by Netflix/Amazon these days: Guns? Baaaad. Christians? Baaaaad. Masculine men? Baaad. White guys?

Also, the acting was probably a notch below that film.Everything else, however, was done better by The Silence. The characters were far more consistent in their motivations. When the Grandma sacrificed herself to save her granddaughter, the act was set up in a far more meaningful way, and in an action that seemed believable for the character to take than when Krasinki's character did it in a A Quiet Place.Both movies leave you with questions (seriously where did they get all that sand in A Quiet Place), and both have endings that could have been better, but I felt this had a far better climax. By adding the cult members as a new threat, it was more than just ""be quiet"" to survive. I do think there was a far better explanation for what was happening in the world and why than in A Quiet Place. It does make you wonder, however, if the creatures were feeding on everything in sight and spreading in record numbers, how they were able to survive underground. What were they eating down there?In short, I'd say The Silence had a far better plot, story, and characters than A Quiet Place.

311,acutisnasus,All these bad reviews? BUT,6,22 April 2019,"I'll try and give my view on the ""strange"" or unrealistic events that happened in the movie.The daughter is completely deaf;The daughter became deaf 3 years ago in a car accident. I don't think that she is entirely deaf. There were I believe 3 moments in the movie where we were hearing what she was hearing, a high pitched frequency and a very far away sound. And also, that a person is called deaf does not mean that he/she is entirely void of sound or can not speak. The actress did a good job portraying a girl who is deaf and talks, it should take away the believe of people not being able to talk normal while being deaf. Don't believe me? There are videos of deaf people complaining that people do not believe they are deaf because they speak so well.Carnivorous Bats surviving millions of years underground;It's not really such a strange thought that creatures could survive underground in caves for millions of years.
There are underground lakes, so it's not unreasonable to think they ate normal bats, snakes, fish and maybe even other animals we don't know of (it's still a fantasy movie). That they survived million of years is plausible.World ending event;To me the movie did not seem to be implying that the world is ending, but that only America was being attacked. The Vesps only originated from one place and on the first day started attacking some cities in America. The second day they find out in the farm house that entire regions are without electricity, not whole states. The third day, after the night in which they fought the cult, they left the house and are heading towards the north. We never know in what state the rest of the world is.Internet still works;As long servers are powered, the internet works. Without human maintenance it'll probably last only a few years. So it's comforting to know we can still communicate for a while if it happens for real. Besides in the movie, the few days that we followed the Family, we know that power is working in some regions. So it seems logic to me that internet was working at some places in the movie. (while they were in the city it worked, the internet stopped working when they were in the farm house and they had internet again when they arrived in the north).Staying Home like the news said;Yes, of course stay where there are literally thousands of them flying over your head, as you could see when the family moved out. And when they moved out there were army jets flying towards the centre of the city. I don't think trying to survive so close to thousands of those creatures with the army trying to fight them (without sound?) would be a very good idea. Let's say you do stay in the house. You would have to be really still. All noisy applications off, no cooking, no sneezing or coughing. You can't flush the toilet, the stink would be unbearable. Any sound would be notable because there are no other sounds to camouflage it. I say it was a good choice to move out of the city. It is high likely that the rural area would probably have less of those creatures and therefore I would think have a higher survival rate than staying in the city next to those thousands of creatures.The family made stupid decisions;When they heard the news they got out of the city because of the noise and the thousands of creatures flying over their city. They chose to go to the rural area, where there would be less noise and maybe also less of those creatures. They searched for a house to have shelter for the night, which is probably better than staying in the car with cracked windows. They searched for medicine which they needed badly. They found out that north was probably saver so they moved north where they could survive. So every major surviving decisions they made, they decided as most of us would do. Which I find not so bad decisions.Cult created within days;It's not unreasonable to think that the moment such an event occurs, existing cults or a bifurcation of a cult would rise within a very short period of time. Reminds me of the mayan 2012 end of the world hoax, people were very quick to believe that. You only need a few people with fear who want to believe and a someone who twist and turns truths and you have a cult, as history has repetitively shown us, that is never hard to do when there is a crisis.That Fertile thing;When I saw that the lunatic wrote that, the first thing that came to mind was that the leader is a pedophile and the others are following him because they are also pedophiles or he convinced them to believe the human race is decimating and it needs to repopulate. I guess the writers could have come up with some better reason to kidnap the deaf girl.The creatures are stupid;Are they really? They just came out the caves, so it's logic that not all have learned what each sound means. If there is a sequel, we'll probably find out if they have learned to distinguish the above ground sounds, like the wood chipper.Kill all the creatures with the wood chipper;It was a nice scene with the wood chipper, too bad the wood chipper stopped because it got stuck with the bodies (dad does not let go of the button). The family did the right thing trying to get away from the creatures and start finding other people, they are not soldiers who are setup with the task to exterminate all those creatures, they are a family who needed to survive.Lure the creatures with sirens;That would have probably been a better scene than the metro situation, lure the Vesps with a siren so that the city folk can escape and then suddenly the siren stops because the thousands of Vesps broke the loudspeaker and they are now after the noisy people who are trying to escape.Lure the creatures with a loud noise and bomb them;I'm sure the military were at the place where the most Vesps were, we saw jets flying towards the city. And they probably have had great ideas to exterminate thousands at a time. Me, I'd prefer poisoning them instead of bombing them. But we are following the family who were trying to get away from the Vesps. We only know what the family knows.
So this was my (fair?) view amongst all these bad reviews BUT,The movie felt as if it could not decide if it should be an action movie or not. I can therefore understand what the disappointed reviewers were talking about, they should have stayed home or how the army should kill the creatures and the sudden cult leader thing. At those moments it felt like the action could start right now but then it didn't. When the family heard the news, they could've stayed home and all kind of exiting stuff could happen, but they didn't stay. When they moved out, the jets were flying over to the city, it felt like now here comes the army and does their thing, but we don't see it. And with the cult leader it felt like something exciting and smart is going to happen, but it went in a different direction. It is a very simple 'what if' story and although it was told maybe in what I felt like an undecided way, I was immersed in the story and wanted to know what would happen. Therefore a rating of 6.",The Silence

Creatures that have an enormous appetite live for millennia in a sealed cave with no food source and emerge in thousands when some explorers break through a wall.
These noise sensitive creatures couldn't catch anything through sound alone. They are so noisy themselves they couldn't tell their prey from each other. And echo location, like bats in real life, isn't hampered by their prey moving silently.

Bird Box had the smart idea to keep the origin of the foe unknown - maybe the writers should have done the same with this movie.And speaking of writers: the writing alternatives between being cliché-ridden to dull to incredulous. They try to make the main characters slightly intelligent which is good but they still make some very dumb decisions like not keeping watch and taking in strangers. Sounds familiar?

Really??? Did you forget that quickly that you were just stuck on a Hwy I'm gridlocked traffic? And even if the ambulance could get through the gridlocked traffic (which they couldn't) how are they gonna find you on that off road secret trail detour that you took to get where you are?? And even if they could find you, the whole plot premise is that any loud noise triggers attacks from the creatures, so then there's that.3)After the crash when you hike and finally arrive on foot at the gated property, you mean to tell me that woman who lives there is the only person on Earth who has no idea these creatures have the whole country in a panic??? So she comes barging out of the house weilding a shotgun and yelling at the top of her voice ""Get off my land!""??? Not even asking who this family is and what they need?? And not trying to keep her voice down to avoid noise???4) After the crazy loud shotgun lady is attacked by the creatures, you are able to just crawl through the huge drainage pipe and enter the yard easily because even thought the property has 8ft locked fences, somehow both gates at both ends of the drainage pipe big enough for a human to crawl through were unlocked????5) The creatures have only been terrorizing the population for a matter of weeks, yet this strange cult has formed and the cult leaders has cut out his tongue????

Sound attracts these things. Stanley fired up a wood chipper as a distraction once, and these things flew right into it and got frappe'd! Release that information to authorities, fire up every wood chipper in North America and bam the population would diminish greatly if not disappear.

If anything A Quiet Place and Birdbox ripped off the premise from the 2015 book The Silence by Tim Lebbon. Do some research people, there have been numerous articles that state as much.As far as the movie... a middle of the road decent time killer, it held my interest. It could have been much more in the right hands. I thought the acting was on par with the material the actors had to work with. CGI was lax and the situations the family found themselves in could have been orchestrated to be much more complex and dramatized. This is why A Quiet Place excelled.People try entirely too hard to figure out what's wrong with a movie rather than just enjoy it.

A random new character pops up, there's some new weird mysterious aspect to the movie that just felt forced. If this were a TV show and not a movie, then this new character wouldn't have been a problem; he would've added a lot to the plot line and made it more interesting, giving the show room to grow. However, being that this was a movie and only an hour and a half long at that, this new character's exit had to be rushed in a way that honestly was not very well blended with the movie. Then after the exit of this one character, there was one more bit of plot shoved into the last 3 minutes or so of the movie. The romance (not a spoiler, it's obvious from the first 10 mins of the movie) between the girl main character and this guy, Rob, was a sweet innocent addition to the plot, but the way this ending was shoved into the movie, it just didn't tie up the loose ends nicely and made everything seem squashed.

""The Silence"" start off on the same premise (Deaf Protagonist, sound-based ""creatures"") but also takes elements from ""Birdhouse"" another mediocre movie that explored Sensory Terror. The movie falls flat on its face with many implausibilities, plot holes and an escalation of the situation that is unbecoming of the short time passed and the actual viability of the creatures as actual threats.

The premise was good, and the best part was that this wasn't any old random family who got lucky: this family could sign, which gave them an advantage that kept them alive. They also make a series of rational decisions which endeared me to them as the movie progressed. Still, the second act was strange and poorly finished - with a couple of real freaky moments - but what got me were the concluding claims about biology:If something is already within your capabilities then you don't have to adapt in the biological sense. In that regard, humans can already live in silence, and some do, but, just as a polar bear can't live in the tropics, the vesps cannot adapt in the same way to colder climes. Why would they?

There are some bad decisions made by the family, but not so bad as to take away from the film - unlike A Quiet Place's catastrophe of errors.This takes you in at the start of an apocalyptic event and plays it through fairly well - until the last 20 odd minutes, with a cult popping round to abduct the fertile female!

A family struggles to survive when subterranean bat-like creatures (several nonillion) escape from their underground lair to wreak havoc upon all noisy surface dwellers.
( why doesn't anything ever wreak happiness?)
I have not seen ""A Quiet Place"" but judging from the release dates I have an idea the ""The Silence"" may be a crappy knock off.
About the movie ( no spoilers) the CGI critters weren't bad. The pacing and dialogue were good as was the music. Tucci and Shipka played their parts very well. An outstanding performance by Billy MacLellan (The Reverend) .The story had holes and in my opinion the ending was abrupt and unfortunately subpar.

Good job, Netflix.",The Silence
388,darian-caplinger,"Wasn't exactly spectacular, but worth watching",7,13 May 2019,"*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***I've read a lot of reviews on this movie here on IMDb, but I feel most are either unfair or written by people who don't appreciate the genre. In my humble opinion, the film wasn't wickedly awesome, but it had enough action and suspense to make it worth watching. There were some elements to the film that were either hurried or just completely left unexplained, which is why I gave it an 8 instead of anything higher.The cast was very well chosen, and each actor brings a great believability to the fact it's a family surviving, not just a group of actors who are trying to act like a family. I do find the lack of a single death of the family itself as being a loss, as it really could have added another dimension (grief) to the movie. Even though Hugh (Stanley Tucci) loses his best friend Glenn (John Corbett) in the auto accident scene, when Glenn sacrifices himself so the others may live, there just isn't enough development of the character or explanation of the relationship for anyone to actually care or feel emotional about the loss. Besides, Glenn was trapped and would have died anyway. At least when Lynn (Kate Trotter) decided to sacrifice herself in an attempt to save Ally (Kiernan Shipka) from the Reverend's band of people, there was an altruistic note added to the film. Unfortunately, that moment was so brief it almost didn't matter, especially since the rest of the Reverend's group took Ally again. In the end, it did matter, as her killing so many of the Rev's group to save Ally thinned out the crowd enough so that the rest of the family could decimate the Rev's group with relative ease.In the end, the family makes it to ""THE REFUGE"" in the Great White North, or at least that's where I assume it to be as it's never actually said where the exact location of the sanctuary zone is. Also, it's mentioned that people who find each other in the refuge are in a ""grey zone,"" where apparently there is no Internet service or power to charge mobile devices. If this were the case, how could Ally and her family possibly find her love interest, Rob (Dempsey Bryk)? I mean, it's not like Canada is exactly a dime size country. The odds of finding someone in a specific area in such a large landscape would be almost incalculable. You know what, that alone has just forced me to drop my rating from an 8 to a 7.Parts that feel rushed, unexplained or just completely odd:
Kelly's (Miranda Otto) recovery from her injuries in the attack by the Vesps.How quickly the Vesps ended up in BFE instead of still attacking the living in population centers (even a town of 100 people would have to have taken precedence over an area with 20 or so people alive.Every ""egg"" has an unhatched Vesp that appears to be at the exact same state of development. It's almost like they have no clue to make some appear like they were just laid, or that one was ready to hatch.Every ""egg"" is completely translucent. Obviously that's so the home viewer can see what they are and what is going on inside of them, but that would suggest the membrane is very thin, and would probably then be extremely fragile and easy to pop should someone wish to kill the offspring before they could be fully developed.When Hugh first touched the fence gate at the country house, the bells at the top all went off like an alarm clock. When he went to open the gate, they barely made any noise at all, even though the amount of effort being used was much greater when he actually opened it.How did the Family Andrews survive while mom was recuperating from her injuries? The house may have been stocked with provisions, but I'm guessing as deep as those wounds were before Hugh and his daughter went into town to get antibiotics at the pharmacy compared to the way they looked when she was taking a bath, quite a bit of time had to pass. Did they go hunting? Did they set traps or snares? Did they capture some random person passing by, cut him up and freeze meat to keep for lean times?Okay, I think that's enough for this review. I was very tempted to lower my score again to a 6 from 7, but I did enjoy the film, so I opted to leave it be.",The Silence
389,coursey693,Better than A Quiet Place,5,18 April 2019,"Barely better, and that is not saying much. A Quiet Place feels more like a film you would see in a movie theater. Is that because it is, or is it something else? As of a few seconds ago, I had no idea whether or not either of the films was a theater release or a streaming service production. However, the overall feel of both films matches reality. The Silence is a Netflix film, while A Quiet Place is from Paramount. The Silence has less completely-stupid-actions-or-decisions moments that jolt you out of the movie than the other.Perhaps filmmakers should screen rough cuts of these types of films to regular people, or at least people with a modest intelligence. Should we accept that all film and television shows with similar end-of-the-world or zombie-like themes will have stupid people doing stupid things because that is what creates the drama? Would a show that portrays people weathering these scenarios successfully not be entertaining enough for an audience? I suppose the answers to these questions are ""Yes"" and ""No,"" respectively.Why do I watch this stuff? They are almost always mediocre, at best.

Those critters are blind and hunt on sound only, a simple thing like a noisy blender would attract them and kill them easily and in great numbers, just as shown in one scene where they massively fly into a wood chipper machine and are chopped to pieces by the hundreds. Hey, a meat grinder or even a document shredder would do the job! Yet everybody has to move north to colder zones in order to survive because those little monsters can't stand the cold!Also noise can easily be used to manipulate them, whether to attract them or to lure them away, also shown in another scene, so there are so many easy ways to get rid of them that the whole movie makes no sense at all!These creatures come in great numbers, but depend on their ears to locate their prey and on their teeth to attack them. This is such a great weakness that they pose only a threat for really stupid and careless people. The army? The police? Just ran away? Got killed perhaps?The movie could have been more fun with some more realism or at least more logic, showing some creative methods to fend of a light threat resulting in a happy ending. For example a barking dog wearing a spiky armor, complete with helmet, it would attract vesps and have them killed by empaling themselves on the spikes of the armor. Also chainmail is effective against bites, especially from smaller creatures, so come on, where's the one eyed guy that is supposed to be king in the world of the blind?This movie could have been a very good one, but as usual original ideas tend to turn into completely worthless movies.

Not to mention, the ending made it seem like this was a pilot episode for a tv series. I was confused as to why these creatures can hear a car running but not talking lightly or walking. And also why wouldnt the family take their small problem solving skills to larger scales to desecrate the entire species instead of living amongst them? (Like the wood chipper, for example). The cult was a little too drastic and it made the movie feel rushed. I thought it wouldve been more realistic to just have a person want basic access to safe shelter, rather than to hostage ""a fertile daughter.""

THIS IS BASED ON A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN WAY BEFORE THAT MOVIE. It's not a rip off. It is totally possible for movies and/or books to have similar plots. People, writers especially, have similar ideas. That doesn't mean anyone stole anything from anyone else. Get over it.Now let's talk about this movie. I agree that the acting was awful. Stanley Tucci and John Corbett are both good actors, but in this movie... It didn't work. It felt like they were acting, not living this apocalypse. It just didn't feel believable.I also didn't care about the characters. It all started too fast with no real development of this group of people. I'd say the movie needed to be longer to develop them properly, but it was soooo boring I don't think I could handle watching another 10 minutes let alone the time it would need to build this plot and make me actually care.The creatures were fine. It could have been believable if there had some more buildup of the story, but more importantly, I think a good portion of the plot from the book was lost in translation when they wrote the script. I could see how things were supposed to come together in the end, but with the movie it felt forced and unreal.I really wanted to like this movie.

The Uncle relation connected with us because the movie showed non-blood familial bonds before the crisis and the love that still exists.It was another great use of sign language in movies.

449,sammie_now,Silly story line destroys this movie,3,1 May 2019,"The trailer of this movie was ok, so I thought to give it a go. The story ark could have potential, however there are so many plot holes to begin with and then the storyline chosen is also very odd that with the sudden ending you get a ""what the F"" feeling quickly and it doesn't go away.The first plot hole is that these creatures do not eat each other, but however manage to survive for millions of years. They are blind, go wild on any noise even if it is a crowbar but again do not eat each other but yes they recognize their own eggs. Wonder if they can smell, if so they would be able to smell 'meat', so there goes the 'just throw something somewhere and I'm safe' theory. The fact that they go wild on any noise creates at least one other plot hole. They can break through car glass, why did they stay in the cages for all those millions of years? The earth sounds probably went very deep, but they just sit round for two people to pound on their door. Another problem is that instead of hide in a cold place the government could have made an easy like fishing net trap with a large loud speaker. So no reason to write this story ark actually.Let's move on to the humans. How stupid can you be to go in your car and where'd you want to go? They only make stupid decisions in this movie, but more on that later. First... I don't really understand the reason for the deaf girl. The writers probably though that this was a good way for the family to communicate without making an noise, but the noises a human makes without speaking are abounded, besides that it would have been far more interesting to see how a family copes without sign languages. This is the easy way out.. And then your friend, whom at that moment can't really know yet how serious the threat of these creatures is, wants to cash in his paycheck so out of blue wants to be left alone to heroically die.Because your car makes noise which you do not want to make AT ALL you decide to go walk in a forest, where the leafs on its own and the twigs on the ground when you walk on it make of course makes no sound what so ever... After hours you come across a house, the only way to reach is to crawl through a drain pipe with your back pack still on, which by the material it's made of always makes noise. Always! Now the creatures just attack any noise on sound only, not by sight. But now they precisely fly several feet into the pipe, to only go for that very small snake. How lucky.Then the writers decide to make the obvious threat letting mum potentially die, if you do not go out there again to get antibiotics. Remember you just walk for hours through a forest you are not familiar with, in an environment you do not know, but can easily find a small town and manage to go back and forth in one day. Of course you meet an nut case who cut out this tongue. Again... why this story ark? You can still manage to talk (a bit) without a tongue and you can certainly make noises! This guy suddenly knows where you live and you are stupid enough to not lock the gate behind you (twice actually! The first time you come back and the second time you ask them to leave you alone). Mum takes a bath (seriously..? try to let your water run without making noise.) and daughter uses the internet, why that still works is a miracle. The power houses and servers makes a lot of noise and need maintenance by humans and where other devices have a dead battery within one day this one works on both ends, but ok let's go with the fact that the internet still works (roughly). You go to bed and because nut case wants your daughter 'who is fertile' they make a trap with all the same phones.. More phones than the size of their group and of course you want to lose your connection with the rest of the (internet)world you easily discard your device like that.And then poof... you find yourself instantly in the cold and start doing a Robin Hood with your best friend who survived and hunt these creatures one by one.
I don't know what Netflix was thinking or what the writers drank during the write out of this movie, but seriously. With a cast like this, they owed us a better script.. a better story. If not for Miranda Otto, Stanley Tucci and John Corbett (who does a lousy job.. sorry..) this movie would be a 0 out of 10. Now I can give it a 3 out of 10 and give you the advice to only watch if you want to kill some time by watching a movie that doesn't need to much thinking.",The Silence

Seems like the makers of this movie just wanted a quick buck and were riding the success of the John Krasinski movie.The creatures are blind and depend on their hearing to guide them. The family has to survive in this new world without noise. The grandmother sacrifices herself by screaming to save her family. etc. The list goes on and on.The creatures seem exactly like bats, just blind and vicious. In theory, they should be easy to trap. Just get a large building or structure with a door, lure them in with noise, and lock them inside.

However it ended up being better than I expected how it could've been so much better. Also I highly recommend the book as it is awesome.A few good points are 1) the acting was pretty good especially from Stanley Tucci and Kiernan Shipka, 2) there were some really good and creepy scenes that do the book justice, 3) the creature designs were pretty good and come relatively close to what I pictured them to look like, 4) the priest was genuinely creepy (apologies I don't remember the name of the actor but he was really good)Unfortunately on the negative side, it's way too short, at an hour and thirty minutes long it rushes through very pivotal and important scenes and moments. Making the film seem anticlimactic as well as incomplete. The ending was also a little disappointing, especially when compared to the ending of the book.All in all it's not a bad film, it's just not great.

Unfortuantly the film lacks tension and momentum from scene-to-scene. The acting was poor, dumb characters, almost no character development and terrible writing.So let me get this straight...There is an outbreak of 'scary' flying creatures (we never find out much about them, apart from the fact they came from a cave, and considering they're the main threat you'd hope they frighten the viewers a bit, but they really don't) that are killing people all around the US.On the news there is footage of a woman and her son in a car, on a road, next to loads of other cars with dead people and the creatures are killing them.This family who lives somewhere near/or in a big city (we never find out precisely where they live) sees that footage, decides it would be safer to leave their perfectly fine home, and get in their noisy car and drive onto noisy roads half way around the country risking their lives?!?How are you safer out their in the open, on a noisy road in a noisy car! Just stay in your house, stay quiet, and stop panicking. Maybe make a plan before driving off without any food/water/other resources.Also, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to bring the dog with them? Dogs are also pretty noisy!Pathetic attempts at character development. This is all we find out about our bloated cast: > Grandma - secretly smokes > Daughter - has a secret boyfriend. That's literally it. There is nothing else we know about our main characters before we are chucked into the sudden panic of this film.By the way, who is Glenn? Is he a friend or relative? Should I care about him dying? Because I really didn't.Also how are 'our characters' so good at avoiding squeaky floorboards, rocks, twigs, and just general stuff that makes noise?And like many others have mentioned, why does 'daughter' have the sound on her tablet when chatting with Rob if she is deaf?That scene where they get medication, what the was the point in that? Literally 15 wasted minutes. You could of walked out of the door quietley like you have been doing before!? How was walking out of the door less dangerous than lighting a mop on fire when you're RIGHT NEXT TO THE CREATURES?Despite the (incredibly stupid) creatures not being scary at all (they just look like drunk bats), I though the small scene where the daughter saw the eggs hatching were pretty cool. Not sure why she stuck her face right next to it, but okay..I really don't have much to say about the random reverened who wanted to kidnap the daughter, it was just an easy way to have a fight scene at the end. Oh and a thunder storm as soon they all start fighting and make loads of noise. How convenient. There a lot of convenient things that happen in this film that allow 'our characters' to survive.Sound effects & music? Naah none of that, we'll just have very forgettable ambinent music that is trying to be creepy, but it's just not working.There really isn't much going for this movie, but I'm sticking with a 2/10 because the initial concept is interesting and some of the CGI is decent (which is incredibly generous), but ultimatley there are other movies that do this genre much much better.",The Silence

461,vaughanynv,Oh dear what a terrible movie,2,7 December 2020,"I'll start by giving the actors and actresses credit for doing their best to take seriously what was a pretty horrific premise for a movie.
Sadly, when there are as many plot holes as ""The Silence"" served up, no amount of valiant performances were ever going to save it.
Leaving all clear and obvious scientific impossibilities aside including the (isolated from anyone within the ground since the dawn of time) ""vesps"" having a ravenous craving for flesh (particularly of the human variety), I couldn't help noticing that they didn't half like that house in the middle of nowhere. The thing is, there was no earthly reason why. The house was about as remote as it gets, with complete silence reigning across the countryside and very few obvious food sources for blind creatures entirely reliant on their hearing. The movie certainly gave no hint of a heightened sense of smell.
However, these creatures chose to hang out there in their thousands. It's father and daughter encountered very few of the creatures on their expedition into town to get the mother some antibiotics and pain relief and about 4 or 5 in the town itself. Weird too that presumably having never encountered a human being before, these creatures chose to lay their eggs in human bodies. Bizarre in the extreme. The mother, who was bitten pretty badly, seemed to perk up quite a lot to be fair after those meds. I don't know what those meds were but it was suddenly like her bites never happened.
Anyway, for me the question was, having found a way to move about freely, why didn't they just move somewhere else? Like into town where there were strangely 1/1000th of the isolated house's predatory inhabitants.
Which brings me to the quiet ones or whatever they were called. They were so annoyingly bad that I'd have braved the inevitable swarm of vesps just to get a few jabs in, let alone to take them out.

464,PalmersGreek,Absolutely bloody awful,1,11 April 2019,"The acting is terrible. The script is worse. The effects aren't bad but by the time you get to properly see the creatures who bloody cares?The start irritated me a lot. Middle-class family. Girl is deaf and is getting bullied at school by a bunch of assholes. Everyone else though is just so nice. The boyfriend, the mum, the dad, his business partner-they're nice, Business meeting and the dad is getting screwed by a client, don't worry, he's nice to him. The young brother is told to stop playing console games by his mum and to do his homework. Mother switches off the game and he just takes it, because he's nice. Can you please explain to me any family in the entire world that is like that, because I've never encountered one. Later, we see grandma smoking drugs-more brainwashing by the pro-legalisation body. But don't worry, everyone is so nice that's it's completely okay. Even when the grandma has a panic attack and almost gets them killed, they're so nice.Then the apocalypse happens and now they're no longer nice. Wow, such character growth. They go from nice to not-nice. That's pretty much it.There are so many plot holes and problems with the structure of the script. There's a single solitary scene that really jarred. It introduces some other people sitting on a train and evicting a mother with her crying baby then watching them die. Why are they sitting on the train? How long are they planning on staying there? A day? A week? A month? Why don't they tape the kids mouth shut and then quietly walk down the tunnel to safety. Why just sit there? What if you want to go to the toilet? Why are we watching them anyway? They're not linked in any way to the family we've been with from the start. Who cares?Loads of info on the news about how the creatures are drawn to sound. So let's have police cars with sirens, TV emergency channels playing tone, fighter planes doing what exactly? I have no idea. And then the family do something stupid. They take a barking dog and a delirious stoned granny who screams at everything on a road trip, because the girl said the cities would be hit the worst. Really? Worse than staying in your home where you have access to provisions and can board up the windows? Worse than being around people who can help you? Is it better to be in a noisy car, either stuck in traffic on the freeway or tumbling down dirt tracks in the middle of nowhere?To be honest at this point I fast-forwarded the movie. Some sub-plot involving the kids parents having to become brutal and kill some other people. I don't care, I've been watching The Walking Dead for the last eight years. This crappy movie is never going to match that.If you've got Netflix, watch it because it will kill some time.

The monsters( Vesps) were quite boring and simple. I was sad to see that Kiernan Shipka was given the role of a deaf girl seeing that there's still a huge lack of deaf people being offered big roles on tv, this gives an impression the casting directors didn't really care about whether the opportunity was given to a deaf person. There is a lot of talking and noise going on when the monsters are known to be around which doesn't make the watcher nervous about if they will be heard or not, contrary to in A Quiet Place where every move that seemed a little loud had the audience at he edge of their seat. The challenges the characters have to face in silence are mostly not that exciting. It seems nothing can top Emily Blunt giving birth in the bath tub after all. The movie does have some interesting and tense interaction between people in and outside of the protagonist family but it would've been better if there was more of it.

Then came a similarly themed Bird Box on Netflix and I thought that was OK and watchable, Now comes The Silence, A Quiet Place wannabe that just doesn't have the oomph or pinache of the original. It had some good moments but were too few and far between. One problem I had with both A Quiet Place and The Silence is the premise that humans are too inept and powerless to keep from becoming prey/food for the creatures. They're attracted to sound so why not set up some humongous speakers and amps in an empty stadium or city, crank it up and get all those suckers to gather there, then have an an F-22 drop a tactical nuke on them and blow them all to kingdom come.

477,JaruJaruJ,"Solid Acting and Tension, Terrible Writing",5,26 April 2019,"A very MEH movie. The acting is fine enough, and there's legitimate tension, but the movie's main premise holds it back. Why would creatures that can be killed by regular weapons ever pose a threat to humanity? Regular military personnel would have zero issue taking these monsters out. Heck, at one point in the movie they take out a bunch of them just by turning on a mulching machine, and the creatures just shredded themselves flying into it. Not only does that make these creatures seem HIGHLY compatible and easy to defeat, it also contradicts with the whole idea that these were unstoppably adaptable monsters. They could literally turn on a giant bug zapper and the creatures would take themselves out. Also, if these creatures were trapped in a cave for millions of years, then how did they survive? What did they eat? Why aren't they adversely affected by the drastically different conditions of the surface world? Why aren't they baffled by all the bizarre noises that they've never encountered before, like lightning storms and trees rustling in the breeze? And if some farm equipment like a mulching machine can take them out, then why can't other heavy machinery in places like the dump take 'em out too? I'd imagine a compactor would be pretty effective against these things. Also, how on earth could this many creatures be trapped in a cave? They literally overwhelmed New York in a day, which would require ABSURD numbers of bat creatures. Also, them having such a high birth-rate makes no sense. If they were trapped in an underground cave where there most definitely were limited food resources, then they would have evolved to have LESS children, as reproducing in massive quantities would have eliminated their food supply down there, whatever it is, ages ago. Oh, also, the whole idea of having a deaf girl somehow having an edge against blind monsters makes NO sense. A deaf person would have a VASTLY more difficult time staying quiet, so that element of this movie doesn't add up at all. It's like having a blind person going up against monsters that are deaf. Being blind does NOT give them an edge when it comes to hiding just because they ""live in the dark."" In summary, the acting in this movie was good, but the writing is so utterly filled with plot-holes that it just doesn't work very well. It wouldn't hurt you to see this movie, it's not terrible, but it's also not very good. A 5/10 movie if I've ever seen one.",The Silence

The problem has to do with time and pace, there is no reference to time that grounds you well enough to understand the players plight or their emotional pain, you are left with huge gaps and holes that make you feel as though you the audience missed something, I'm sure it never made it into the movie to allow for the time slot . The pace hurts the progress of the movie by dragging in in multiple directions but giving no foundation to the overall story.
Also the movie is like watching 3 different stories that could have been fleshed out with more depth. The antagonist in the story had an element of creepy but failed be believable and stole it's look from other creatures.

Most of the characters besides Tucci's and the Deaf Girl's were fairly forgettable and mundane, which significantly took away from the movie.

The writing was above average, despite the fact that it took elements from ""Bird Box"" in the final act and remade them fairly shoddily.All in all, the movie was worth watching, and kept me entertained, but had major, glaring issues that could not be overlooked and took away from a lot of the movie.

The basics are that an ancient race of aerial creatures is unleashed and decimates all in it's path. Their senses are based around sound (similar to Quiet Place) and I enjoyed that part of the movie *but* it then adds a sub-plot of a cult-like group who chase our dear survivors because ""The girl is fertile"". Because it deviates from what it's already set in motion, the movie ends ups confused. Bottom line is that if you're going to make a creature flick then have it entirely based around the creatures you've created, don't devolve it into the generic ""We're a cult and we want your little girl"" because the end product becomes extremely lackluster.
It's a shame because I was enjoying this movie but adding the really badly done cult aspect absolutely takes away from the experience. If this movie would've purely been about the creatures, survival etc then it would've been a genuine treat to watch but after the bad sub-plot I can honestly say that there's better movies out there that'll kill your time.A 2/10 for me.

These bats have ravenous appetites for human flesh, but how did they survive underground for all this time? What did they eat, Morlocks?The biggest plot hole in this film was to just drive somewhere without a destination in mind and no real provisions, or even a plan!! Uncle Macho Man decides to go off-roading while pops is following behind him by driving the family in a minivan. Nothing could go wrong, right?The boy spots a cabin in the woods, a place where the family can seek refuge! Yay! Except the poor lady who owned the cabin apparently didn't watch the news reports or get the memo about being quiet, or maybe she was just following the advice on the news about sheltering in place. We will never know. The homeowner tries to tell these freeloaders to scram, but is quickly devoured by the bats, very convenient. So now the family can move in and claim the house, how nice. Dinner was even set for them at the table!Next dad and his deaf daughter head to town to find some antibiotics for mum who got gnawed on from a bat attack while heading to the cabin. In town the dad and daughter meet some freakish cult leader who wants them to join him. We later learn this is because the cult leader apparently likes young fertile girls. A basically pointless subplot that actually makes the movie worse.This is literally day 3 or 4 of the world going nuts and already cults have formed with freaks and freakish followers! That's just a nonsensical idea.In the end the family heads north to the arctic circle because the superbats don't like cold weather.

Come on this isn't the purge! Also, why'd all the news people talk about it like it was some virus, I'm not doctor but i think i know the difference between murder bats and the flu.At about 1/3 the way through the movie you realize how ridiculous the scenario is when the dad kills like 100 of the blood thirsty bats with a wood chipper, if every city set a couple of those off wouldn't it be pretty easy to take them all out? Just have everyone run their lawn mowers and prop them up to solve the problem.I'm just giving them a hard time, the movie was entertaining because you start to like the family before the whole apocalypse starts taking place so you're kind of attached to them once they stop listening to all directions given to them by the CDC and wind up getting a few people killed.

548,albertocrosi,"""The Silence"" more like the ""Not talking or screaming is enough to not die because the damn things couldn't link a ringing bell to the person ringing it""",1,14 April 2019,"This movie is absolutely bonkers, the family acts in the most stupid way possible, the human villain is introduced 30 minutes from the end and the overall message from this movie is totally useless.
But let's go in order:
1)We are IMMEDIATELY presented to the ""monsters"", called Vesps. No big mystery, no unclear nature. Just a weird bat-like animal which, despite having evolved in a cave for millions of years, has the only resulting feature of having an incredible sense of hearing and razor sharp teeth. Why is their diet made up of meat and not insects? Why do they lay eggs inside of big mammals? Just because it is gross, I dare to say.2)The main heroine is deaf (and also absurdly bland). Yes blablabla, we've already seen A Quiet Place, but this movie is bad on his own even if AQP didn't exist as a standard paragon for this genre. The main difference is that here it is hinted that this disability should be in any way an advantage, while the only advantage is that they already know how to communicate via sign language (as if people wouldn't develop or try to learn that skill). Everything else? If anything, she is at a disadvantage because she isn't aware of the sounds she could make. But this is never presented in the movie so, moving on.
3)""Please stay in your homes, stay inside"", and they immediately proceed to leave without any plan on where to go. And they end up staying in another house in the middle of nowhere. Was it worth it? Hardly, mostly because the uncle and the dog needlessly die in the process.4)They take a detour to avoid traffic: the uncle's car is destroyed (because of....deers) and he's trapped inside of it. No menace is visible, there's no hint that the vesps are coming their way, yet the uncle decides that they should leave him there, that the dad (yes I refused to learn the characters' names, it's easier this way) should ""care for the family"". They leave him there when the vesps actually arrive and they shed maybe a single tear...for the dog, who they had to let go because it wouldn't stop barking. Whatever, the uncle was a gun enthusiast anyway.5)They end up leaving the car and walk to a remote house, where they witness the lady living there being eaten by vesps (it was honestly funny). They have some trouble, but dad activates a shredder which attracts and kills hundreds of vesps in a matter of seconds. Why don't they leave it on to exterminate every vesp in the vicinity? Why don't they tell other people about this easy way to kill them? We've seen deaf daughter using instant messaging to chat with her boyfriend, they can easily post about it anywhere. Also, how did vesps survive if they can't even tell apart living beings from a shredder? Evolution would have killed them a long time ago.6)Mind this: at this point, we've it the 50 minutes mark. There's still just 40 minutes left.7)As it is mandatory in horror apocalyptic movies, they have to go into a deserted town in search for medicines. They stumble upon a nest of vesps, who deposit their eggs into eaten up people: the eggs look like they're already hatching, even though just 3 days have passed. Given this rate of reproduction vesps would extinguish any life form in a matter of months.8)Along with medicines and vesps' nests, they found this comicly crazy priest, who started this tongue-cutting-and-""fertile""-girls-searching cult, composed of anonymous people who, after literally 3 days of this ""apocalypse"", have resorted to following the craziest person around. Apparently, people have even started crucifixing and burning people at the stake, as the internet tells them (yes, the internet is still on). 3 days in. Apparently there's some ""people are crazy at nature"" thing going on, but we have less than 30 minutes to end the movie, so we'll just ignore all of this, as the writer did.9)The evil cult attacks the house (how did they find where they live??) in the most idiotic way possible: they lure our family into letting in a distressed girl, who produces cellphones from under her jacket; they start ringing, luring in the vesps (which, mind you, would just attack the girl wearing the cellphones. And also, if she was meant to be the alive bait, couldn't they just ask her to scream? They act as if cutting your tongue makes you incapable of making any sound!); meanwhile, the cult infiltrates the house (couldn't they just sneak in while the family was asleep instead?) and kidnaps deaf girl, who is saved merely five minutes later by her family. The grandma (ah yes, there's also this useless character: she's terminally ill and...that's that.) sacrifices herself. The priest is beaten up (presumely left for dead). The day is saved.10)They go ""up north, to the refuge, where vesps can't survive because they can't survive the cold"". Where exactly is this place? Why can't everyone just wait winter (or better, turn on shredders to kill them all), instead of venturing into the wilderness (roads are somewhy to avoid at all costs) to reach some unknown place?
They eventually find the refuge, after months of searching (conveniently cut away, because we have like 4 minutes before the credits roll in, and presented just by the grown beard of dad). Deaf daughter is reunited with her boyfriend.11)Deaf girl ends her story telling us that ""evolution is the key, but who will evolve faster...us, or the vesps (to cold climate)?""
Quick answer: given how quickly they lay eggs, they would also evolve incredibly quickly. So yes, humanity is doomed (unless they learn to leave on shredder).tl;dr Can someone please explain to me why Stanley Tucci and Miranda Otto decided to play a role in this garbage pile?",The Silence

566,denos-3,Derivative redo of every other contemporary cable horror film,4,12 April 2019,"The casting is fine and the technical production values are theater worthy. But the plot is a random mismash of elements from every other SF / Alien monster / Apocalypse movie you've seen in the last 10 years. Literally as if it were generated by a computer algorithm based on popularity of specific elements with no attempt to integrate them into a plot that makes sense to humans.Monster predator evolved in isolated cave system - check! Survivalist cult full of PTSD psychos - check! (and they apparently formed on DAY ONE of the event). Deaf girl, because who would better understand how to exist in a world where you must not make any noise - check! (clearly they don't understand that being deaf means you can't hear the noise you're making, but really its just an excuse for the family to know sign language and thus gloss over various plotting problems).No comedy is meant here - it has neither the winking of Sharknado! or the deliberate satire of Mars Attacks!.

569,yaoiflame,Unoriginal,6,13 April 2019,"After many slasher horrors and many, way too many supernatural horror movies, here come the 'sensory' horror movies (i.e. you're forbidden to see or make a noise (you get extra credit if you're mute/deaf, or both)). This movie brings zero originality. A Quiet Place was the first movie to explore how we should behave should some calamity befall us if we make a noise. In that movie, much like in this one, there is a mute/deaf girl that fits into this post apocalyptic world perfectly. But unlike The Silence, A Quiet Place does this job poorly for many reasons. But we're not talking about it now. We're talking about The Silence and in what ways, although it didn't entirely suck, it was an unremarkable, unoriginal, formulaic movie.We have a family - a mom, dad, younger brother, a girl who has been deaf due to an accident, for about three years now, and a grandma, who is dying of cancer (presumably lung cancer). We have a family dog and dad's best friend.What I found overly repetitive was this:Pets are always a liability so we have to let them goSomeone is terminally ill and when they sacrifice their life for the good of the rest of the group, we don't feel as bad because they would've died anywayInternet and electricity, especially electricity are still running somehow (with no generators, and also, hasn't the society collapsed?)A relatively happy ending in a new community trying to survive in the new environmentRomance that succeeds somehowWhat I think is praiseworthy is the use of the sign language by the whole family and even some friends - in the wake of all this political correctness and inclusiveness, where they practically shove it down your throat - I didn't find it distasteful and I found it endearing. Especially because deaf people face a lot of stigma and some are singled out from their family. Despite Ally being deaf, she wasn't anyone 'special'; she blended into the group naturally. Her disability is a plus only in that the family has learned to sign and hence this saved their lives. She is smart much like her younger brother, and sensible. She is like everybody else.That priest and his flock were unnecessary, but had the movie had more runtime, it could have developed into something more significant.Blood and gore was excellent. I liked that I was able to see the creatures and their anatomy and learn a bit more from what is shown - that they lay eggs inside those who they kill.Overall, despite having some suspense, it was not remarkable at all.",The Silence

What's wrong with that is that once you lose your hearing your voice will begin to change and have those uncompleted words that deaf people who speak do because you can no longer hear your voice. So from that perspective it made her character unbelievable as a deaf person because she still spoke in her normal voice without losing any of it because of not being able to hear her voice.

All the birds flied away into this machine and became meat sauce, excellent!
After this, this stupid priest came into the picture and this idea was all gone. Instead they came up with a new idea (walking dead), to move on to a free town in the north where the birds could not live. The ending was also feeling like a bad version of the walking dead.

It wasn't done very well at all, here's why:
The monsters looked like some kind of weird bats, and looked more humorous than scary
The deaf daughter could talk and whisper like she wasn't deaf, what was that all about? I know deaf people and you can tell in their voice.
They talk through most of the film, even when they're apparently needing to be quiet so as not to attract attention.
Stanley Tucci was a weird choice, but admittedly he is a good actor, but he brought absolutely nothing to the film.
The acting on the whole wasn't very good.
There's one scene where the mother is getting attacked, and the father turns on a wood chipper, and all the bats fly into it and get shredded.

I really thought it would be like a prequel to A Quiet Place, but it wasn't; it was disappointingly dumb and not scary at all.
Even though it had Stanley Tucci (He's a great actor in my opinion) and John Corbett (Another great actor) are two of the protagonists, the plot is predictable and it just wasn't scary at all. The antagonists aren't original, people. I've seen scarier. So if you want a non-scary hokey rip-off of ""A Quiet Place"", see this. Otherwise, don't waste your time.

The choices for the character's actions were a little wild, though-spoilers follow, starting with the mildest.Why does Tucci's character hurl the tire iron away when he returned to the van? In ordinary days, it's a tool maintained for emergencies, and in dire times, it doubles as a weapon. When he chucks it, it's just weird, but then you see that it's a set up for ""an idea""-Tucci leaves the safety of his car to retrieve the distant tool *so he can throw it again*. Come on.Then we have a cult led by ""The Reverend"" (again, c'mon!) that appears to've cut their tongues out inside of 24 hours of the creatures's release. And the cult is sufficiently concerned with ""fertile females"" that they're ready to murder and kidnap girls on the second night of the apocalypse. Meanwhile, an unstable (tongue removing) cult has come to Tucci's door requesting the fertile young woman, and then everyone goes to bed. It gets worse, but we do have two fantastic self sacrifices by gonna-die-anyway people that provide a balance of Good, Hard Choices that real people would make.",The Silence

Characters are added in the eleventh hour to enforce plot points and as such are underdeveloped and two dimensional. In addition; characters which are well established often have their key plot points abandoned at random, to be replaced with secondary plot points of other characters with which they are able to engage in.

I'm not sure what the underground herbivores feed on, but presumably there's a whole underground flora that gets by without photosynthesis. These herbivores must be pretty ferocious themselves, since they have forced the egg-laying bats to evolve such deadly teeth and talons. Though slower than the bat-things, eventually they too will figure out how to crawl through the same hole to the surface.So I'm thinking sequel: ""The Bleat,"" in which a race of killer sheep invade the eastern U.S., and every action scene begins with a terrifying ""Baaaaa!""

It's basic knowledge that these bats came from deep beneath the earth. What were they eating? Plants? There's no light or anything required for plants to grow so how did they? Also, why did they evolve to have so vicious teeth and claws if so? Makes no sense. You don't evolve to have sharp claws and teeth when feeding from plants. If so, why were they all of a sudden eating meat? We're they eating other living beings from beneath the earth. What beings? We need answers! Finally, if there are so many bats, they would have needed a HUGE food source. So where did that come from?2. The ending? What? When? Why? All of a sudden she's with her little boy crush with a bow hunger games style.3. The plot? I saw no plot. Not a decent one anyway. I'm finding it hard to see what the story was trying to tell us.4. Boring characters. Didn't feel sad that any one of them died.The only good things about the movie was the mysterious man and his 'cult'. Which by the way didn't get very far plot wise. Who? What?

I hate aunt Zelda's acting, and the whole family were laughable as a ""deaf"" family. The daughter didn't remotely struggle with speech or feign to struggle. I get that her deafness was a recent development, but i have known many deaf individuals and the whole movie almost seemed irreverent toward that community, in that the roles were clearly poorly researched by the characters except for stanley tucci, who generally is great in most of his films.

The creatures themselves make next to no sense in their survival and how at least 100 thousand of them were inside a cave (look towards the first shot of the city being attacked and remember that this is happening across other states) and how they were able to sustain themselves so easily. The being vulnerable to cold and using their wings to better locate the origin of a sound was a nice tough until you remember that wood chippers exist and even just small objects can completely throw them off, the second losing its weight when you realize that you can move to northern Canada and be completely safe. From this the threat in the movie seems to only be a threat to countries on the equator and separated by vast oceans. Though while i do spout a lot of anger towards the film, i do think that it is redeemable by showing whats even going on in the world other than 3 minutes of CNN, plus it does have a good cast.

I just wanted to start by saying the cast was great for the movie plot, the idea of the movie was interesting, but the follow through was a disappoint. Maybe I'm spoiled and enjoy movies that are longer than 1 hr and 30 mins, but this movie had soooo much potential. First off, the main character, Ally who was deaf, hardly seemed like she was deaf at all. I understand she was in a car accident and lost her hearing, so she clearly knew how to speak prior - but it wouldn't kill anyone to show a little more ASL. Secondly, I would have appreciated more backstory of those following people? It would have made more sense as to why they were the way they were... but unfortunately there was no clearance on that. This movie kind of seems to be copying A Quiet Place, no? Or Bird Box? Those were great movies. Good introduction, plot, cliff hanger, end. Where was this one?! Lastly, as I was getting into it more after they killed those guys, I check to see how much longer the movie had, and it cut to Ally with Rob together??? What happened prior to that???

Though ravenous, these creatures are only able to find pray through sound. This movie contains little ups and downs, it's dissapointing plot is a not so subtle rip off of the smash hit 'A Quiet Place'.The washed out shots with a twilight like filter makes this movie hard to take seriously. Ally, the eldest child in the family is deaf which has basically no place in the plot, the family is meant to know how to live a silent life because of this fact, reading lips and using sign language. The sign language was inaccutrate and felt rushed, everyone must have done one online course and called it a day. Even though they knew how to sign they still find themselves talking while signing, creating noise when not needed, it totally destroys the tension about these creatures and leaves the viewer laid comfortably in their seats.The consistency with these ""vesps"" is horrible, in the beginning of the film when the uncle died he needed three or four gun shots to bring a hoard of them, but many were called by a simple rattle snake.The subtle inaccuracies are what make this movie frustrating, the lack of love put in by any of the crew or cast shows. It lacks passion by my means.The addition of the cult elements were unneeded and added nothing too the unimaginative cookie cutter horror plot. The Silence can't make up its mind on what type of horror it wants to be, creature? Survival? Cult? The only thing this movie chose to be was bad.The only thing worse then the entirety of this film was the end, a sloppy ending to a sloppy movie. The timeline of this movie gives nothing too the viewer and you must guess what is happening by the end of it.The silence is a snooze fest filled with plot holes in the loose interpretation of what they call a plot.

671,eliasbenna,"The Silence, nice one but..",7,11 April 2019,"""The silence"" is a dystopia by ""John R. Leonetti"" that pictures the discovery of a deep cave in which live strange creatures that do not have the ability to see but can hear. In addition, as similar as A Quiet Place, if they hear you they hunt you. The average drama and scene making are good. The intelligence of the actors to convey the terror feeling is considerable and so is to find crucial solutions to fix the terrible attacks of the weird creatures.
One lesson to learn from this well-directed horror movie is to reconsider the sensibility of human beings to reveal the monstrous inner desire to take control over other human beings. This was the way a troop of so-called saviors of humanity treated the main family in order to own their poor little ""fertile"" daughter. Additionally, in order to ensure their silence, they proceed by cutting their own tongues.
Everything seems great with this movie except for one important matter. Im not the feminist protestant kind of watcher but the masculine dominance is quite remarkable in almost every particular scene. In one hand, we can find the mother as the weak victim of the change, the daughter as the target of the rebellion troop, which considers her just as a body, a container of the future survivor generations and finally the grand mommy who was simply the sufferer victim. However, in the other hand, we find the dad, god of family, as the savior from the strange creatures, the protector from the rebellion troop and even the driver of the car!

674,evansharpmanchester,The Silence: not exactly a decent film,2,20 April 2019,"It seems that it's impossible to say anything about this film without mentioning its clear similarities to John Krasinski's A Quiet Place.The plot centres on a family who, under the threat of mysterious creatures that eat anything that makes sound, try to survive by seeking refuge in the wilderness.Firstly, A Quiet Place takes an almost identical plot. Watching the trailer for The Silence even made me think this film was a prequel to A Quiet Place.However, the poor acting is attributed, of course, by a poorly written script that made me think the film was meant to be released in the 80s or 90s, when creature-feature situational horrors were popular and fresh.The stale script, awkward camera angles, cheap set ups and poor characterisation made this film uninteresting. I tried my hardest to get invested in this film, feeling that perhaps Miranda Otto's character was the only one I could almost like... almost but not quite.There seemed to be a disconnection between the family members that ruined the film's (few) immediate thrills, which seemed to diminish its value as a horror film. Likely, the faults to this film had something to do with its low budget and poor production.I wouldn't recommend watching this film unless you watched A Quiet Place first, because I gained more respect for John Krasinski's film after pushing through The Silence.Although, one would have to pity the author Tim Lebbon, who published the novel (The Silence) in 2015 to acclaim. Lebbon then had to endure Krasinski stealing his idea, adapting it to film, gaining higher (and well-deserved) critical acclaim for it with A Quiet Place which was released in 2018.",The Silence

The first half on the other hand, was good as it explored the societal impacts in the subway scene. The car in forest scene was one of the only moments of suspense and contained many good shots and helped the audience explore the monsters and establish there abilities.
I think it was another of Netflixs attempts to recreate ""birdbox"" and it's success. There where many plot holes as many other reviews state and felt rushed overall.

Probably one of the worst movies I've watched in my lifetime.The pacing is so incredibly awkward and the characters are so unbelievably shallow, underdeveloped, and stupid that I was hoping they were each eaten alive. The movie very clearly attempted to follow a horror story format that served no purpose other than to fit stereotypes about horror movies: stupid characters, awful pacing, and awful climax. At least a third of the movie is needless dialogue that isn't used or referenced later in the film, probably as an attempt to pad for the short runtime.I don't know if I could have produced anything worse. When the movie ended I wanted a refund for the time spent watching it. It's not even enjoyable to make fun of because I just get angry thinking about it.

No need for religious cults or the national guard, just a couple of bored people with machinery who can sit back and have a beer while they wait for the problem to take care of itself. You can expand this to workshops too, if you want things over more quickly.

Why would that lady run out of her house yelling and shooting knowing the current situation. Why was the cult even a part of the story. They didn't even fit with the story and felt shoved in at the last minute.

705,tdmears,Five Dollar Netflix Version of A Quiet Place,1,8 November 2020,"Before I start, if you have seen A Quiet Place, there is no need to even watch the trailer of this film.Okay, here we go.At first glance, this film catches the eye of the audience for starring well known actors and actresses such as the great Stanley Tucci, Kiernan Shipka, and Miranda Otto. Like many flopped films with stars, this is one of them. If you really want to bum an hour and a half, go for it, but here's the deal...The film starts with a crew digging underground in Pennsylvania beneath the Appalachian trail. First big marker- the creatures in the film should have already reached the surface if there were that big of a deposit in the ground. There is no way that small of a crew which in the movie consisted of two diggers, a captain, and two cameramen, I believe, were able to dig all of that. Those creatures would have already breached the surface, and this isn't even fifteen seconds into the movie. Secondly, if you are part of a crew excavating underground, common sense would guide you to use some sense of heat sense tech or another tool that would track movement, because by the sounds of it there were millions of these creatures if they were able to bring catastrophic levels to multiple states in the United States and be able to have CNN come out with reports that they do not like the cold when Kiernan Shipka's character explicitly quotes that CNN was reporting from a bunker. Where were the reporters? I could not tell you, but this information was getting out somehow, and I will remind you again, this is not even three minutes into the movie.The Vasps, which was the name given to the creatures, were basically bats on steroids. Like A Quiet Place, these creatures could not see and relied heavily on their sense of hearing. Another huge error in this film is the fact that these Vasps had to have lived for hundreds of thousands and possibly up to millions of years to evolve the way they did. These creatures lived underground, with millions of their kind in a cave. Where was their source of food for all of that time? I could not tell you. Why didn't they attack each other if all they attacked was noise? Another one of those mysteries of the world.They were in a cave, which might I add, caves of that large a scale cause echoes, so all of those Vasps should be dead. Another thing I might add- if these creatures are in any relation to a bat, then there are many holes again. Bats do not like the sunlight, so these things wouldn't even be out during the day, and why wouldn't these creatures just use echolocation like bats?Again, at this point in the movie we haven't even been introduced to the main characters and my fingers are cramping typing all of this.In closing, all you need to know is this movie also has a main character who is deaf, a family that is really good at sign language, and a seemingly never ending list of holes and mistakes and you have this movie completed. All you need left is to find a bow to finish the wrapping of a college student level film. My advice, realize that someone close to the family dies, this movie is deplorable, they figure out how to kill the creatures, this movie is deplorable, and it's all done with less writing than what I've done for this review. Did I mention this movie is deplorable? Anyways, please do not waste your time with this movie. There are so many better things to do, unless of course you want to make fun of this movie, because in that case, you've come to the right place.",The Silence

First off instead of the aliens you have these pterodactyl looking creatures that are also blind and they came from a ancient rock? Secondly you have a family who have a hard of hearing daughter just like a quiet place which works well since you have to be quiet. I'm pretty sure the actor from a quiet place is deaf where as Kiernan Shipka definitely is not. Its clear that this isn't the only carbon copy of a quiet place, a quiet place is an original movie and the concept is like nothing I've seen before. If you compare these two then you can clearly see the obvious similarities and strange differences netflix put into this movie to make it seem original. Also can we just acknowledge the fact netflix put known actors into this film just so it would get people to watch it. This movie got 29% on rotten tomatoes and a quiet place got 96%.

I personally liked the acting, it wasn't extreme or dramatic, just low key, as regularly people would be, in that situation.
And i find the way they solve things, and the main characters way of thinking and acting, super realistic. For once, I didn't get annoyed because the characters were acting stupid, selfish, ignorant or were just dumb or didn't pay attention.
They were thinking fast, logical and learning and adapting with the knowledge, and it was awesome, to see for once!It is not the best movie in the world, and it wasn't trying to be. It's a movie made for shocking and entertaining, and it delivers. Nothing more, nothing less.
I liked it. Would probably also watch it again. I'm just sad that people have been bashing it so much, cause it made me not watch it sooner...And for people bashing it because it has the same premise as, A quiet place or Bird box.
1) Why are you shocked, it is literally in the description if the movie and in the trailer. It's not a surprise it resembles the plot of those movies?
2) why are you mad that it resembles them?
What about the unending movies about virus spreading, zombies, werewolf, demons and so forth? Its pretty hard making a scary movie, and not reusing a premise for the plot, used before.
3) I really liked bird box and A quite place because of the premise of loosing/minimizing one of our senses, and adapting to that to survive. So I just enjoy that there is being more movies made with that premise, cause I think it is really interesting.
4) and last... The movie is based on a book that have been written before those movies. So its not a rip of.To sum it up. If you like the premise of Birdbox and A quite place, I think you will like this movie as well.

I guess they could do something to render the babies voiceless.
It's just weird when they're trying to get things figured out and just beginning to learn to survive, that they'd even be considering procreating immediately.

Aside from the obvious plot holes such as not addressing how the creatures managed to survive for millions of years in a cave, there were a number of other significant problems.Here's a couple more for you to ponder. How long did they travel before coming upon the old lady's house? Couldn't have been that long given that no one was worse for the wear or even needed a shave (dad) when they got there. Yet, apparently it was long enough for entire cults to form as seen when the father and his daughter went to find medical supplies.The most glaring hole for me, and it made me stop the movie midway before I convinced myself to continue, was the fact that the wood chipper was literally destroying these things, I mean literally. Yet, they turned it off and continued to sneak around choosing to hide and not try to clear them out. And no, they didn't tell anyone about this and I guess no one else was smart enough to figure it out.

Leaving the audience with many questions and a lack of depth toward story.The introduction of interaction between a group of radicalistic humans and the main family contributes to an interesting dynamic for the very brief time the take the screen. Additionally, the films characters seem to lack rational thought in tense situations in trade for attempts to evoke sympathy in the audience for characters that have been significantly underdeveloped due perhaps to the short running time.With a overall lack of tense or generally scary moments and an extremely pathetic and lazy ending, 'The Silence' is certainly not a film that will create much noise amongst film audiences.",The Silence

Also, why does it seem that one moment the vesps are attracted to a single gravel crunch, but the next second they can't hear a group of like 10 people fighting in the open?The lack of subtitles was also a bad decision, since not everyone can sign.I'm not going to complain about the cgi as it wasn't too horrible in my opinion.
