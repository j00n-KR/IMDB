0,Hitchcoc,Is There a Line to Be Drawn?,6,20 March 2013,"This was disturbing to watch. First of all, one needs to buy into its cultural me milieu. Then we need to begin to accept the two fundamental characters and how they meld into that setting. This is a story of unbridled sensualism. It's soft one moment and hideous the next. The movie is incredibly graphic and I'm sure the release frightened and confused its patrons. I have to admit, I never really fell under its spell. As a matter of fact, I think I felt that I was invading a sick kind of world. Was I seeing people or monsters? There is great effort at times to prevent it from moving into the next level. The performances aren't really sexual as much as sadistic. This is proved out.",In the Realm of the Senses
1,gavin6942,Glorious!,8,30 November 2015,"A passionate telling of the story of Sada Abe, a woman whose affair with her master led to a sexual obsession which then came to a violent end.This film is easy to dismiss as ""glorified porn"" or something of that nature. Indeed, it tends to go beyond what we call soft-core... there is no hiding the male anatomy and some acts are rather explicit. And yet, I never really felt like the film was ""dirty"" or gratuitous.There is something to be said about love, sex, obsession and the life of a geisha. Certainly in western society we find it hard to believe a prostitute or porn star could have a meaningful relationship or be in love. What of the Japanese, who view prostitution somewhat differently? This is an interesting exploration.",In the Realm of the Senses
2,jboothmillard,In the Realm of the Senses,7,7 May 2013,"This French-Japanese film, also known as Ai No Corrida, I knew was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but then I found out that it featured real sexual intercourse, oral and various other intimate acts, so I had to see if a good story fit with it as well. Basically in 1936, Tokyo, former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works now as a maid in a hotel, and she is molested by the owner of the hotel Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji), but she is not offended by it and the two of them begin an intense affair. They make love passionately with all kinds of sexual experimentation, drinking and other various forms of self-indulgence, and they do not seem to be bothered with people walking in on them, and to pursue his affair with her Ishida leaves his wife and family. As time passes Abe for some reason becomes jealous of Ishida, probably in terms of receiving pleasure, and she also becomes very possessive, but all he ever wants to do is make her happy, whether it means more intense experimental sex. They become so obsessed with their escalating attempts to achieve the ultimate love making experience and orgasm that he allows her to engage in sadomasochism, this mostly involves her strangling during lovemaking. Eventually it comes to the point when Ishida is killed by Abe strangling him to death, but she is not completely phased by his death, in fact she goes as far to cut off his penis and testicles, and with his blood write the words ""Sada Kichi the two of us forever"" on his chest. Being based on a true event the real woman was arrested for the crime of murder, but in fact many people who heard about the story were empathetic towards her because of the passionate love she had for the man. Also starring Aoi Nakajima as Toku, Meika Seri as Maid Matsuko and Taiji Tonoyama as Old Beggar. I will be honest and say first that I was most intrigued to see real lovemaking on screen, and it is not something I have seen often in a foreign film regarded by critics, but then I remembered seeing a clip of the controversial ending on a programme, very hard to watch, it is a very interesting insight into how extreme passion can sometimes go too far, a most watchable erotic drama based on a true story. It was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!",In the Realm of the Senses
3,BA_Harrison,"Fatal attraction, Japanese style.",6,20 January 2017,"Former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) works as a maid in a hotel where she begins a torrid sexual relationship with the married owner, Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji). As the steamy affair progresses, Sada becomes obsessed with her lover to such an extent that she threatens to emasculate him should he ever sleep with his wife again, a promise she eventually keeps (but only after throttling him with her belt).Released on DVD by both the BFI and Criterion, and included in the book '1001 Films To See Before You Die', In The Realm Of The Senses is clearly highly regarded by many film experts who see it not as pornography but as an important work of erotic art. I'm not convinced that the film is anything other than a case of flagrant exploitation—beautifully shot with fine performances, but still no more deserving of critical acclaim than your average sex-fuelled pink movie.Watch it before you die, by all means, but don't expect anything more thought provoking than 109 minutes of repetitive unsimulated shagging, with a little bit of fun with a boiled egg, some winkie-tugging, and a gory finale for good measure.",In the Realm of the Senses
4,Quinoa1984,"they did a bad-bad thing... or rather, she did, or maybe both of them",8,18 June 2009,"Nagisa Oshima is a brave filmmaker, but not because he went over the line with making the first film in Japan that was considered pornographic and not a ""Pink film"" (which, ironically, has all genitalia blurred out). It's because he takes on his subject without flinching, without going for an easy route in depicting this relationship between two people whose extreme lust discombobulates their actual love for one another. The way you know In the Realm of the Senses is not a porno is simple: if you're watching it, and you're getting off, then either the film didn't connect with its actual character development and acting and moments of real behavior, or you weren't watching it for it as a movie in the first place. Oshima wants his film to be respected as a real film, if not the best art in Japan, and he achieves that respect by giving us characters who are whole and go on this self-destructive path in the midst of a country in militaristic upheaval. They're people, warts and all, not simple sex machines.The only real comparison that could be made to a porno is, perhaps, that if one is watching this movie, and one's mother or father walks in the room, the reaction would be similar to that of porn. Some of the acts that Kichizo and Sada go through, sado-masochism, choking, sex with someone else right in front of the other, might even given your grandmother a heart attack. But there are other scenes, too, tender ones, revealing the behavior of characters who first connected sensually, when Sada worked for ""Master"" Kichizo and screwed like rabbits. But we also see this bond that is very rare in movies, and too ""classy"" for your common XXX picture. There's just little things Oshima has his actors do, their attitudes. Take one moment when Sado is giving fellatio to Kichizo, and the focus is not on that, on the contrary to Kichizo's lack of interest, carefully smoking a cigarette, savoring this sight of pleasure like it's an out-of-body experience.The theme is obsession, and this is expressed in such a way that is all-encompassing for the characters. We see two people who we do actually care about- remember ""make love not war"", this is that to a whole other level, emphasized even more in that brief but critical scene where Kichizo walks opposite the marching soldiers in the street- who can do nothing but take things to one level and then another level. I'm almost reminded of Cronenberg's Crash where the characters' initial connection gets twisted more and more with each new encounter, and in this case Oshima's bright lighting and small sets emphasizes the ironic lack of freedom that these two people have with one another. Adding to this the acting is very intense and interesting (if, most critically, sometimes repetitive due to the nature of the script such as bits with the knife), especially from Tatsuya Fuji who seems to make his character harder to peg than his ""lady"".Oh, it is not a masterpiece, at least in my estimation. A few scenes here or there could have been trimmed, such as that bizarre ""wedding"" scene with that orgy occurring and the man playing singing in the background. Perhaps it's being from the West and not understanding all of the customs shown, if maybe that's part of Oshima's point to twist things just that much further than would be realistic. But when Oshima has his eye on there two flawed bodies who want nothing more than one another at all costs, it's extremely exciting and intriguing to see where it will go next. Flesh and genitalia are bared, and there is full on penetration and fluids seen et all, but it's the subconscious cracked open that makes things most interesting. It's a real film, take it or leave it. 8.5/10",In the Realm of the Senses
5,lastliberal,"A girl like you can stab a man's heart without a knife, huh?",6,4 February 2009,"This Japanese pink film is no video nastie, as it lacks any sort of a story other than a prostitute wanting continual sex with a married man. Of course, he will take it from anyone he can, and she will leave him to make money, but the rest of the film, over 80% is the two of them engaging in numerous bouts of sex and perversion - sado/masochism, food perversions, whatever, until the story gets so boring she has no other choice but to end it permanently. It is a dark film about sexual obsession with lots of obsessive sex. Art or porn? That debate will go on forever.There was just nothing erotic about this film.

6,The_Void,A shocking tale of love and obsession,8,10 September 2008,"In the Realm of the Senses is a film that has divided opinions among those that have seen it (a number that is not too big thanks to the film being banned in many countries across the globe), but love it or hate it; you have to admit that In the Realm of the Senses is certainly very interesting. The plot is allegedly (according to the epilogue) based on a true story, although I would describe it as a more hardcore version of the 1969 Pinku film 'Blind Beast'; although In the Realm of the Senses is a really different experience and could not in any way be considered a copy of the earlier film. The plot primarily focuses on love and obsession, and we get two central characters. They are Kichizo and Sada and the pair meet and fall in love rather quickly. It's not long before they are spending every waking minute together; and most of the time they spend is naked, engaging in sex all the time. Sada soon becomes infatuated with Kichizo and as their relationship becomes more and more intimate, things begin to spiral out of control.This film is somewhat unique for the fact that it's both Japanese and features gratuitous, full-on nudity. The film really doesn't hold back either, and one of the most shocking things about is how seeing the two central characters naked for most of the film doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary. There's some hardcore and explicit sex scenes too, with blow jobs, anal etc featuring often. The film is sometimes passed off as merely pornography, but it's not a fair statement to make about the film. While it certainly is very pornographic, it's clear that director Nagisa Oshima valued telling a story over shocking his audience and the gratuitous nudity exists to further the point that the film is trying to make. The film is very well made; the cinematography is beautiful and all the performers do well; Eiko Matsuda in particular is excellent as the obsessive leading lady. It's clear that the film is building up to something and while the conclusion is hinted at early on; it's still shocking enough once it arrives. Overall, this is a fantastic film and a must see for cult fans.",In the Realm of the Senses
7,zetes,Holy Cow,8,25 March 2000,"This is no masterpiece, but it has a great distinction amongst the world of film. One can never go beyond this one in audacity. Never. If I described some of the stuff that you will only ever find here, this review would never be posted. They went so far a couple of times that I had to clap. Some of it is just so great.Besides its audacity, the two leads are very good. Even though the movie consists of very little besides the sex scenes (and what little it does is not worth it; the weakest part of the film is its script), the main characters are pretty complex. But if you're looking to see something which is erotic and beautiful, stay away and rent one of my all time favorites, Last Tango in Paris. In the Realm of the Senses is surely erotic, but it is not beautiful. It's main function is to disturb.   8/10",In the Realm of the Senses
8,blanbrn,"Japan porn at it's best, a film that pushes the erotic and sexual limits to obsession and even raw brutality.",8,26 January 2014,"Of late I've became a big fan of Asian and Japanese erotic films especially since I admire and find oriental females attractive. Anyway this hard core very erotic and push the limits sex passion film from 1976 ""In the Realm of the Senses"" did indeed entertain. It's a visual delight a pleasure to view as the passion and sex scenes push the limit they are clearly hard core and over the top as the film has never been viewed in it's native of Japan. It's really a film of sex and more sex as director Nagisa Oshima wanted to show that sex can be an obsession and become a passion that's dangerous and brutal passing love even leading to death! Anyway the film still does have somewhat of a story and plot it's set in the 1930's around the time of ever on going imperialism and governmental control, it revolves around a house of Japanese servants all ladies for a man and soon he falls in love with one of his new girls as the love is all consuming but destructive as both this man and woman(Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda)with be split up and carved up!

9,lasttimeisaw,a sui generis cause célèbre that throws away human's last fig leaf to state its sharp-edged point.,8,22 July 2018,"It goes without saying Ôshima's succès de scandale is not for the squeamish, its blatantly hardcore content (unsimulated sexual activity including fellatio, fornication, and a puckish egg-hatching prank) shatters the last defense of anyone's reserves about human copulation, thus topples it from its tabooed sanctuary, then demythologizes it with a pretension-free candidness and boldly burrows into the subject of the often oppressed and sidelined female sexuality, yes, it is actually based on a true story occurred in the 1930s.When Sada Abe (Matsuda), a former prostitute who works as a maid in a hotel in Tokyo, first lays her eyes on her employer Kichizo Ishida (Fuji), it is in the middle of the conjugal duty between him and his wife Toku (Nakajima), a passionless, ritualistic rumpy-pumpy that bewitches her. So when a virile Kichizo takes a fancy to her, something irrepressible is ignited, their illicit affair spreads like wide fire, they stay together in various inns, entertained by sundry geisha, and from then on, Ôshima leverages their indoor activities interrupted only by necessary outings, viz., when Sada has to tide themselves over by way of solicitation, or Kichizo is bound to visit home for a three-day stint. It is these seemingly short separations and its resultant jealousy that torment both, and spur them into more extreme measurements in their sexological exploration, until Sada finds the button of choking Kichizo during penetration to sate her libidinous upswing, whereupon she must keep pushing it.What mesmerizes viewers is Ôshima's unsparing portrayal of Sada's randiness and her ingrained phallus worship, every waking minute she seeks for Kichizo's private parts, the fact that she completely overpowers him, dominantly rides on him, has him do her bidding, could be any man's worst nightmare, yet there is truth in the discrepancy between male and female's orgasms, and what if a man cannot sexually satisfy a woman he loves? A perpetual dread hovering every heterosexual man's ego and occasioning chasm if mistreated, we must hand it to Ôshima for his audacity to lay it open like this, however radical it looks, and demands us to re-examine the different vibes in man and woman's sexual equilibrium. Conversely, all Ôshima's effort, essentially de-eroticizes and desensitizes sex itself when we are inured to their oversexed indulgence, it is not amorous, not aesthetic, not even orthodoxly arousing, which causes it to be subsumed into an act solely stimulated by primeval desire. If one puts their perversion under the milieu, it can be feasibly read as a resistance towards the ethos of its time, and Ôshima's anti-militarism disposition writs large in the segment where Kichizo glumly passes by a band of marching army, on the opposite direction with the flag-waving populace.
 
Both Matsuda and Fuji brave themselves for their controversial roles, an unsparing devotion to the art form even with the foregone conclusion that the film would impinge on their acting careers, while Matsuda thoroughly incarnates Sada's undue possessiveness, insatiable lust and hellbent conviction of going whole hog, Fuji's wayward resignation is much more telling in his shiftless head space that disillusion and malaise might be the more pertinent cause behind his destructive behavior, both deserve to be put on a pedestal for their earth-shattering derring-do along with the film itself, a sui generis cause célèbre that throws away human's last fig leaf to state its sharp-edged point.",In the Realm of the Senses
10,gbill-74877,"Torrid passion, explicitly shown",7,12 July 2020,"My god, this is explicit. Let's just say I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore when there were three penis scenes, one ""in action"" in the first seven minutes, and it never let up from there. It feels pretty close to porn but has pretty good production value, with nice costumes (when they're on, haha), traditional music, and decent camera work. There is a semblance of a story but it's pretty one-dimensional, though maybe there is honesty in showing all-consuming passion and a torrid affair for what it is, and it's refreshing to see the simple joy in a couple exploring physical pleasure. The guy's laugh reflects that and is a delight. As for the sex, there's a wide variety of kinks, hey, maybe something for everybody (or conversely maybe something to offend everybody, I don't know, I mean the little kids scene and the 68 year old granny definitely made me cringe). If doing it in front of others is your thing, this may be your film, as there seemed to be quite a bit of that. Anyway, it's all pretty shocking stuff even now, much less 1976 in Japan. I wish it had been a bit more balanced out, with more scenes where we sense it's 1936, or flesh out (hehe sorry) the psychology of the characters.",In the Realm of the Senses

12,videorama-759-859391,"A totally different realm, where dark obsession rules",7,25 October 2014,"Warning: this film contains the most graphically depicted scene of castration I've ever seen, and it was certainly a shock as having never anticipated it. Such a sexual obsession is scary, where a sexy female servant, Sada, who was prostituting herself too, in this Asian house of ill repute, falls for the husband of the Madam, running the bordello. To think this was based on a true story, what was even more shocking after the castration, was bizarre, like that woman tourist who was beheaded two years back, leaving a shopping centre. Never has a more overwhelming obsession, occupied the screen, where Sada moves in with the madam's husband, an what ensues are long days of sex, food gorging, and not much cleansing, a little humour too, within the dialogue, like in one dark pornographic scene. There are a couple of repulsive moments, excluding the earlier one mentioned, like an old, off the street guy, who's body is putrid, along with his.... and also it's one hell of a sexy ride, till that arresting finale, ITROTS, isn't a film I'd watch wholily again, or approach it, the same way I did originally.

13,Vartiainen,About the dangers of obsession,6,3 May 2018,"Probably one of the most well-known explicit films about sex and sexuality. Based on true events, the movie tells about Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda), a hired servant, who catches the eye of her master and in turn becomes infatuated with him. Their relationship quickly turns sexual in nature, but things start to slowly head downhill when that aspect of their lives consumes more and more of their waking hours.And yes, there is a lot of sex in this film. Unsimulated sex, in fact. But it's not really a pornographic film. It's a film about obsession and how we can become so consumed by one thing in our lives that it's hard for us to cope if that thing turns sour or is taken away from us or taken too far. And in this case the subject of that obsession is sex.No doubt many a person has watched this film purely for the ""mating"" scenes, but I think that a lot of those viewers were not expecting to also get a story out of it. A discussion about what it means to commit to someone and whether that's even possible without the mental and intellectual dimension present in almost all relationships. With a sprinkling of social commentary concerning Japan's political leanings thrown in the mix.Is it a masterpiece of a film? No, not really. Is it something you've likely never seen before?

15,parry_na,Is it porn?,7,2 October 2020,"After just a few minutes of watching this extraordinary film, you might find yourself asking, is this pornography? It's a debate that has been going over forty years - none of the many sex scenes are simulated: what you see is what you get. Due to its nature, 'In the Realm of the Senses' has been banned and cut before release on many platforms, and the lead actors found themselves blacklisted for a while following production.The story-line involves former prostitute Sada Abe (Eiko Matsuda) being molested by her new boss Kichizo Ishida (Tatsuya Fuji) on the hotel where she now works. This not only ignites hitherto unexplored sexual desires in both of them, but ostracises them from their family and friends. Their coupling takes on new taboos - namely torture, strangulation and blood-letting.Such an unflinchingly raw story is presented in an equally graphic way, and constantly. A scene where a young boy has his penis pulled as punishment seems to have offended most, and the brief moment has been removed from many editions of the film.The acting is first rate, and survives the necessity of subtitles better than most. Not outside the perverse extremes of Director Jess Franco have I seen such uninhibited performances in a non-porn film - if it is non-porn.This reminds me a little of the later Japanese film 'Audition', where the comparative light-heartedness of the opening acts give way to scenes of uncompromising cringe-inducing torture best watched behind-the-fingers.Directed and written by Nagisa Oshima, the film had to be processed in France rather than Japan because of its nature. It is an acquired taste and not something I'll watch twice. There's no denying, though, it is compelling. You'll look away occasionally, but not for long.

EMPIRE OF THE SENSES is an extremely strong, honest, sexy, shocking, touching, troubling film that really defies explanation. A beautifully shot film that some will call ""smut"" - others will call ""art""...personally - I say it's brilliant.Ishida begins an affair with Sada which turns from ""hot"" to ""obsessive"" very quickly. The story (which was based on true events) is told mainly through explicit (and I mean pretty damn explicit) glimpses into the couple's sexual liaisons. As the sexual and emotional obsession escalates, things spiral out of control until the shocking conclusion...EMPIRE OF THE SENSES is one of the strangest and most refreshing films I've seen in a long time. Not only did I LOVE the fact that the sex and nudity was SO explicit (which is virtually NEVER seen from an all Japanese cast) - but the themes of the story were handled so competently by the actors involved, that although practically the whole film is told while the two lovers are having various sexual encounters - the audience really feels the progression from passion to total obsession. As far as the sexual content - there are several ""choice"" scenes in this one - including several explicit blow-jobs (including some cum-dribbling action), several male and female full-frontal shots, some dildo-play, egg insertion, and some straight sex too (though these scenes aren't as graphic as the others).

18,vertigo_14,Art-house or Porn: It was meant to be erotic. (spoilers),4,4 June 2006,"I once thought that the character of Bernado Bertolucci's 'Dreamers' were the most useless people to comprise a narrative; the twin siblings and their American friend who idle in an apartment entertaining one another in sexual desire and meanwhile there is political strife ongoing in the streets just below their window. But that was until I saw 'In the Realm of the Senses' in which, probably fulfilling the teenage boy's dream of a man who forever spends his day getting laid by a fervent, if not psychotic (I guess in some passionate way) prostitute who never seems to relent in sexual gratification for herself and her Master. (Why didn't the woman just surgically attach her face to his penis?) But, this, in remarkably explicit detail (considering this was not intended as a production relegated to the porn industry) is all that fills the time from beginning to end. On the one hand, this effectively captures the ecstatic relationship among the two (the master's wife is almost invisible throughout the film), although towards the end, she seems more caught up in the ecstasy than he (and why not, she's willing all the time to the point of boredom on the part of her partner). But on the other hand, there is nothing else that occurs in this film. The film is quite simply an experimentation in sexual behavior, it seems, it doesn't matter whether you label it art-house or porn, the purpose is to arouse the viewers (and shock them too, as the moments of pleasure are also minced with moments of pain once you get to the finale).This film is, as the final narration reveals, based on the true story of a prostitute who found wandering around in 1936 with the dismembered member of her master following his asphyxiation from their experimentations with sex and strangulation. But, rather than aghast, she surprisingly became a sympathetic character and I suppose her story, legendary (this I can't figure out except for the symbol of the man that she carried with him probably as a sign of devotion).

It has sparked debate and disturbance in equal measure, and remains one of the most fiercely erotic films ever made.Shot with vibrant colors and often eye popping set design, the film tells a simple and tragic tale of two lustful lovers engaged in a relationship fueled by unstoppable erotic desires. Fearlessly, the film manages to portray acts of masochism and sexual ""perversion"" in a manner so frequent and provocative there is no wonder why it has caused so much argument and controversy. This is, without a doubt, an EXTREME film that features everything from eating food from a woman's vagina to an elderly lady being f*cked to LITERAL DEATH! This film is not afraid to drag the viewer along, slowly lowering them into the pits of ""sexual Hell"". It portrays the passionate relationship in a psychologically tormenting manner, one that surpasses the bloodiest slasher flick in terms of true horror.

20,nycritic,Controversial Only for Hypocrites,6,22 March 2006,"The events on which the story of AI NO CORRIDA (a.k.a. IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES) are that of a Japanese prostitute who was found wandering the streets of Tokyo as she held the severed penis of her dead lover and what lead her to this state. Stuff that some might find shocking, unless your name happens to be Lorena Bobbitt and you were planning on re-creating the last scene of this film unto your abusive husband. Then it becomes quasi-feminism in reaction to male abuse.Sada is a nymphomaniac who is about to awaken to even more extreme forms of erotic gratification once she moves into an inn owned by Kichizo and his wife. An affair between them takes place and grows more intense once she demands that he not make love to his wife. In a moment of fantasy violence that precludes the events which become the result of extreme kink, Sada sees herself as a voyeur who interrupts Kichizo and his wife's orgasm by stabbing her in the neck and reveling in her blood.Sada and Kichizo's affair becomes so torrid that it even shocks the other geishas and literally kills an older lady who Sada has Kichizo have sex with. An encounter with an ex-teacher has Sada then awaken to sado-masochism as she suddenly asks the man to slap her as hard as he can. To her surprise, once she relates this to Kichizo, he also asks her to slap him, and from them on, all they can do is push the limits of kink and self-immolation in order to make their sexual encounters as gratifying as possible.I've seen this classified as an erotic drama but it is not. Erotica as a storytelling medium, while it employs sex as a large part of the plot, also has character development, atmosphere, and is not as sexually explicit (although this is debatable as the concept of ""what is erotic"" evolves). AI NO CORRIDA, a story that is from start to finish about sex as a non-stop activity, doesn't allow for any other development: sex, gratification, the little death, this is all that seems to be on the two main characters' minds. While this on paper reads well, it doesn't translate itself to screen. There needs to be a little more psychology entrenched within the characters. Plus, the very explicitness of the sex, while meant to shock on purpose, does the very opposite: it desensitizes. All we see is sex, sex, and more sex. Yes, maybe this is how it happened, but it's showed in one non-stop assault on the senses and due to that, it becomes almost laughable.

The movie is based on a true story that happened in the 30's, where Sada Abe erotically asphyxiated her lover, Kichizo Ishida, during sex, and them cut it out his penis and testicles to walk on streets of Tokyo with his organs in her hand. Many of the sexual scenes between the actors are real, by the way.The plot: Abe Sada works as a maid in a hotel. She is an ex prostitute. When Abe meets the hotel owner Kichizo, they begin to have an intense affair, and while the time passes, Abe starts to have an obsessive behavior towards Kichizo to the point that she even threatens to kill him.

22,ElijahCSkuggs,Eggcelent Movie,9,3 December 2006,"In the Realm of the Senses is a movie I heard about that was said to be incredibly sexual. One of the most, explicit, well made films to be made. And when I found out that it was Japanese I jumped at the chance to check this baby out. Reason being I have yellow fever. Anyways, it turned out to be as good as it was promoted. I was expecting a serious film with that dealt with sex in an extremely adult manner. This certainly did. This movie is full of sex. Almost every scene involves sex in some way. But it's not just you watching people have sex. There are thought provoking conversations during these scenes so you're not just watching some boobs or butt flail around. The dialogue felt very natural between the two actors (maybe due to the fact that they were actually screwing), which made everything very believable. The two actors did a great job. And the dubbing is also fantastic. The voice-over for the male star is awesome. It's a mix of Zap Brannigan from Futurama and Will Ferrell from Anchorman. Some of the lines are fantastic. Here's one...""The only rest I get for my penis is when I pee."" And there are many other great lines. Overall the movie delivers with great sex, a simple but great story line, great chemistry between the leading stars and a fantastic ending. Have fun with this one. 8.5 outta 10",In the Realm of the Senses
23,Vivekmaru45,A good reason why not to get involved with a nymphomaniac. She may cut your d*ck off while you are sleeping.,10,6 December 2010,"Perverted eroticism or work of art? This will be a long debate. To be honest I saw this film after seeing The Gray man (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), and Albert Fish: In Sin He found Salvation (2007), Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), To Catch a Killer (TV 1992).The above films I have mentioned all contain a theme: sex oriented killings due to an unfulfilled sexual fantasy.This film proves what sex beyond the limits can lead to. Sex should be done lovingly, with romance and understanding between the couple. Both should be deeply in love with one another and be satisfied with that. A wife is NOT A PROSTITUTE, she is YOUR COMPANION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You are her shield and protector and to think of another woman is committing a grave sin. Sex with another woman while you are married to a faithful wife is adultery and you are only cheating yourself. If your wife fails to take an interest in sex, there are sex therapists available and counseling as well. You could even go on a vacation and re-ignite your love life. Also you could try out new sex positions you have never explored. There are DVD's which teach advanced lovemaking techniques. THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. This is the most HORRIFYING aspect of the film. THAT IT REALLY OCCURRED AS PORTRAYED IN THE FILM.Plot: Kichizo Ishida a married man falls in love with a woman called Sada Abe. Ishida is unsatisfied with his own wife due to his abnormally high libido. Sada Aba appears to be what we now call a nymphomaniac who cannot be satisfied by a normal man. This chance meeting leads to an explosion of unrestricted sex between the two which goes out of control towards the climax of the film, where Sada strangles and kills Ishida (only after he gives her his full consent to do it). Later she severs his penis.Director Noboru Tanaka's film: A Woman Called Sada Abe is another more sexually oriented film of the same story. Many critics have written that the film is also an exploration of how eroticism in Japanese culture is often morbid or death-obsessed. The film's director Nagisa Ôshima was also criticized for using explicit sex to draw attention to the film, but the director has stated that the explicitness is an integral part of the movie's design.Controversy: Strict censorship laws would not have allowed the film to be completed as per Oshima's vision in Japan. To get around this, the production was officially listed as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its première in Japan, the sexual activity was optically censored.In the US, the film was initially banned upon its première at the 1976 New York Film Festival, but later screened uncut; a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in Germany. The film was not available on home video until 1990.The British Board of Film Censors, at the time of its first limited screenings in the UK, recommended it be shown under private 'cinema club' conditions to avoid the need for cuts to be made, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films (in 1977) to avoid potential legal problems. More recently the BBFC has granted the film an ""18"" certificate (suitable for adults only), leaving all of the adult sexual activity intact, but ordered that a shot showing a prepubescent boy having his penis pulled as punishment be optically reframed so that the act itself was not shown.The film has been made available, however, in completely uncut form in France, the United States (including the current The Criterion Collection DVD), the Netherlands, and several other territories.In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a certificate. However, in the Maritimes the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced.You can watch Noboru Tanaka's film after this one. Also L'amant (1992) a.k.a. The Lover is another good film to see. Basic Instinct (1992) is another film that immediately springs to mind, as well as Fatal Attraction (1987).If you are a film lover and want recommendations.

All of these things are here.  Even before his final payoff, Oshima has revealed and depicted the timeless labyrinthine hell of repressive Japanese society.  The lovers' realm is the rebellion to this, an exploration of truths and emotions severely denied in their culture, even if this is, eventually just as formal.  The portrayal of sex is probably the most beautiful and honest in the history of cinema.  Just as important is the treatment of voyeurism (like Foucault's panopticon, no-one is free from the controlling spying of others) and the privileged subjectivity of the female lead, which, consisting of dreams and imagination, is as powerful a weopon against tyranny as the sex.",In the Realm of the Senses

Here he examines the story behind a famous Japanese scandal - a prostitute was found wandering the streets of Tokyo out of her mind following the death of her lover by erotic asphyxiation - in terms of what is considered 'acceptable' Japanese social behavior. The principals engage in obsessive sexual activity, and allow the addictive and dangerous aspects of their relationship to get out of hand precisely BECAUSE it was considered so unhealthy and immoral by Japanese standards. In a society in which all sexual activity is viewed as shameful, shame no longer mediates behavior. Limits become meaningless. The film itself is colorfully made, with excellent period detail and production design, and the actors are attractive. The structure is that of an erotic novel, as game playing, obsession and danger escalate to a fitting point-of-no-return climax. It is much better and more socially relevant than similar American films such as Nine 1/2 Weeks.",In the Realm of the Senses

Restoration/preservation = ten (10) stars; cinematography and lighting = ten (10) stars; costume design = eight (8) stars; subtitles = eight (8) stars; score/music = three (3) stars; script = two (2) stars. This is a joint French and Japanese film intended (at least initially) for Western festival audiences. Director Nagisa Ôshima (who is also credited as a script co-writer) mounts a tale of a woman with an exceptionally bad case of penis envy who eventually gets to keep one (until arrested for murder!). The movie consists of simulated and real oral/vaginal sex plus a few random scenes of relative depravity (including some kiddy porn) tossed in to hold in check the viewer's growing boredom from seeing essentially the same sex shots repeated for about an hour and a half. Ôshima also strains to keep the viewer's interest with variations on the theme of sexual obsession. This parallels what the two leading characters are experiencing as they try out ever increasing dangerous sex experiments to keep getting a sexual high 24/7 (a classic sign of additive behavior, of course). The script is vacuous and mostly consists of one liners. Unfortunately it is the same line (""It feels so good"") with minor variations thereof here and there. The players are Japanese speaking Japanese. But all post production occurred and stayed in France (including development of negatives!) to avoid running afoul of Japan's legal system. Acting is a cut or two above what might be expected from a contemporary run-of-the mill porno film. Same for production design. Restoration, cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) and lighting are excellent. Kimono are especially colorful and seem designed especially for backdoor ""quickies."" Subtitles are fine (it helps if you can read French for the opening/closing credits). Music mostly consists of solitary shamisen on or off screen. It is what it is!

29,rooee,Extremely good,8,6 February 2011,"Nagisa ""Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence"" Oshima's most notorious film culminates with a truly shocking ending, encapsulating the sheer force of self-destructive passion between Kichi (Tatsuya Fuji) and Sada (Eiko Matsuda). It's an apt, inevitable climax.The film sees a master, Kichi, take a servant, Sada, as his concubine. The balance of power quickly shifts, however, as Kichi struggles to come to terms with Sada's insatiable, and increasingly dangerous, sensual appetite. Together they push away a prudish world that would label them perverts; with the help of a carefully inserted boiled egg, they even mock the institution of procreation.Though notions of class are touched upon (Sada, drawn from prostitution and servitude, refers to her desire to be ""respectable"" when with Kichi as well as a particularly paternal client), really this is a film about sex and death. You certainly can't fault it for scope of ambition, and yet its narrow - nay blinkered - focus on its deliriously conflicted protagonists is perhaps its greatest strength. After the opening scenes, Kichi and Sada dominate every last coital frame.I've found the film becomes sadder, more poignant, with repeated viewings. The addiction is palpable, the self-annihilation agonising - not only in the characters' actions but in their changing faces: the terrible anxiety that what they share is transient; the haunting knowledge that death at the zenith is preferable to a slow decline.I'll paddle into the art versus porn debate by saying that those looking for titillation from this film will probably find it - but they will also find a heartfelt, insightful and ultimately devastating portrait of extreme human desire.",In the Realm of the Senses

What dragged this down was as that there was only sex in it. there was no real story line, the story line presented was so thin that if the sex scenes were cut out, the movie would be so short and pointless.after now seeing it, i don't feel that it is as controversial as i once thought.",In the Realm of the Senses
32,XxEthanHuntxX,Sex-Obsess,8,1 February 2021,"As Neil Bahadur stated on letterboxd - the key moment is at about one hour and twenty minutes into the film, where Kichi walks outside by himself, and we see marching soldiers and children waving Japanese nationalist flags. Kichi looks downward - maybe in shame, maybe in protest, maybe both. But this moment define the whole movie, in my opinion, it perfectly shows the nature of this hidden world that Sada and Kichi create - the 'realm of the senses' so to speak.The film of course contains a lot of sexualities, but actually, the sex portrayals never take a purely pornographic form and inclines more towards art. The couple often have sex with clothes on, and the few close-ups taken of their genitals are more disturbing than tantalizing. Intercourse has such a dark character, is repeated so monotonously often and is so desperately intense that I would hesitate for a long time to call this porn at all. The couple's addiction to each other is so abnormal and ingrained that it is not far off to compare it as a drug addiction. Director Nagisa Oshima has here let the sex itself tell parts of the story, rather than putting the character development solely in dialogue. One never doubts that the couple's feelings are genuine, and that there is a deep love behind their actions.The sexual sense dominates the whole movie, which I would argue is probably pretty realistic. Oshima dwells on the interesting aspects of this unusual love story, by having long repetitious sex scenes which forces a obsessionistic empetizetion about their destructiveness in sex and dangerously possessive behavior, which becomes slowly more and more terrifying.",In the Realm of the Senses

Sada falls in love with Kichizo. Then, they apart in a house and begin to have sex. Sada finds an irreplaceable feeling, and begin to be addicted to it.

When a person surrenders to other finding love and pleasure. But one thing is the intention and other is get it. ""Ai no Corrida"" don't get it. The film becomes to bring the message in some strange even boring forms, i mean, i sometimes yawn watching the same thing, and if this is the way that the characters are developed, i think that there is another forms to do it. The film is fill with somethings that can be shown in other manners, but here much times begin to go to the extreme, for example, if they want to show the evolution of they sex addiction, they can showed gradually, but they shown us the same thing, again and again and again. Obviously, much things happen inside them, but as i say before, the film don't show this good. And if you can hold the ""egg"" scene, Can you get when Sada play with two naked children's, and then her grabs the penis of one the them? I mean, it seems to be sick, annoying and disrespectful. The kid complains, is obviously real. I don't think that this is the way of show the addiction of Sada, at least, if they want to show a kind of pedophilia about her desire, but that is not the reason for no respect. This make that the film even go to the extreme. And there is the end, where Sada completes one of their promises. So he never go apart of her, and he don't be unfaithful to her, he cut his penis. OK, the idea for demonstrate Sada obsession is good, but how is shown here is terribly disgusting.

This film was banned for over 20 years, and while I do not agree with censorship, I can certainly see why it was banned. This has to been some of the rawest, brutality honest and just plain bona fide scenes of sex ever captured on film. The plot centres on a young Japanese geisha, Sada Abe, and her boss, Kichizo. He takes a shine to her and they spend quite a lot of time together, and decide to get married. And the film is pretty much just them having sex. Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of sex. Did I mention they have sex a lot?Kichizo seems to be a sex addict. In fact, it's pretty much the only thing he does and talks about. I was interested to find out this movie is based on a real-life story, so in a way I feel the sex is justified if this all actually happened.If you're the type of person offended by breasts, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!

And I can tell you I'll never eat eggs again!You might think I'm talking too much about the sex, but really there's not much else to discuss. Being liberal I'd say the film is about 85% sex. But the scenes that do not contain any sex (about 4 minutes, I'd say) are quite beautiful. Japan is such a beautiful place, not only the landscape but also the architecture. It's disappointing that these elements were not utilised more. I think in retrospect there is much more to this film than just the sex. However I feel as if I was so taken aback by the sex that the film's finer points may have passed me by. Certainly, the film gets better as it progresses and continues until it reaches it's shocking but surprisingly beautiful ending.This really isn't a bad film. Technically it is very good and the significance it had on Japanese film culture and world censorship needs to be explored. I feel as if I can't recommend it, but as the credits went up I didn't feel as though I'd wasted my time. If you don't see this movie you're not really missing out on anything.

In fact,some scenes were so realistic and so arousing,that it was difficult not to get turned on.But besides the obvious sexual aspects,this film will spark many controversies for years ahead.The controversy whether it is an art film or porn is not idiotic and useless in this case.Actually it combines beyond any doubts strong elements of both and is open to many interpretations. Without being prude,I don't think that less explicit sexual acts would have deprived this film of its art film qualities and wouldn't also have made the storyline less logical and organized.As if one would say that deep inside you know or guess that it would be an art film and therefore would be able to overlook some slightly hardcore subtext.About the meaning of the title-I was surprised to find out that the the word ""Corrida"" does not exist in Japanese and is used in the very familiar sense similar to bullfight.An artistic way to say that love and even more,sex,are a cruel,often violent and ruthless sport or game. This is not supposed to demonetize love,however the romantic,pleasurable face of sexuality are merely side-effects of a natural process which isn't necessarily painful or humiliating,however essentially amoral,wild,basic.Like a game of high stakes and high risk,it can very easily destroy the ones involved and this fascination with danger doesn't make it less appealing.Basically like corrida,it is a strange combination between a bloodsport(and involving also other body fluids)and a mind game,where brute force are mingled with unleashed fantasy and calculating shrewdness.In fact,apart from the sexual interest,the characters keep you haunted and curious like watching an intricate game of chess or poker:tension is gradually rising and you eagerly await to be puzzled and overwhelmed by the next move,much more than you were by the previous.Speaking of tension,one is gradually directed,forced to anticipate a violent and chilling outcome.The characters behave increasingly unbalanced so that one guesses long before anything happens that they will unleash disaster,like in Ettore Scola's ""Pizza Triangle"" or Russell's ""Women in Love"" one grasps the gradual turn of eccentricities and unbalanced minds into sheer horror.And like in ""Happy Tree Friends"",after an apparently nonviolent opening begins a barbaric spree of bloodshed.Unlike the cartoons mentioned above,the mood is neurotically timeless and ghastly,like in Russells ""The Devils"" ""Fellini-Satyricon"" sets,colors etc. preparing the viewer with the entrance in a doomed and savage universe where every step might be the last.About the ending:it was so realistically done,with violently colored bloodstreams in horror film style that I wondered if the actor was permanently harmed.Let's not for get that also in 1976 the film ""La denier femme"" saw an also unbalanced Depardieu undergoing the same ""treatment"",while the lethal intercourse of this haunting,violent couple is almost certainly a source of inspiration for the intense,both destructive and triumphant sexual act in Arau's""Como l'Agua para chocolate""from 1991,where even the sexual position used by the characters,their expression,as much as their physical appearance mirrors this film with a strange ""deja-vu"" effect.Additionally this film might have also influenced,besides Arau,the not less controversial ""Jeux d'Enfants"",both in the violent ending and sexuality as a game(as corrida).The actions of Sada left me,eventually,more disappointed than fascinated/puzzled.In her extreme jealousy,unbalanced behavior she acts more like a contemporary post-modern teeny girl than a Japanese,like the contemporary every-day female as seen in women's and teenager's magazines,popular culture,fashion,in mainstream porn,soap-operas or music videos.She acts so violently not out of lacking self-control,but more due to animal selfishness and a shallow,unintelligent pursuit of pleasures.Inspite of her untypical desires and feelings she is mainly an unimaginative,selfish bitch,incapable of originality in spite of unusual sexuality.What I liked about this film was how it destroyed several popular myths like the crimes of passions as something exclusively non-existent in heterosexual couples and also the way it resembles Oriental storytelling in its disrupted plot-line,including,much like in the erotic stories of the Arabian Nights,subplots,alternative plots,frame-stories and a surprising twist in conclusion,ending it with a saying,a quote or other forms of Oriental wisdom.Irrespective of its ""shocking"" side,this film is still a somewhat flawed,uneven yet also meaningful,intellectual ""almost-masterpiece"",an obvious example of daring experimental forms of (alternative)cinematic art;however,a more cynical view might reveal the extreme use of sexuality and violence as a marketing strategy to attract the most common mainstream Western Audience,which snobbishly and superficially creates the appearance of a non-violent and non-sexual,prude one but is seduced almost instantly by well marketed sex and violence,even if they keep up an artificially respectable appearance.Of course one couldn't see such a film come out of Hollywood,nor the contemporary Hollywood-stars engaging in such violence and real,unrestrained and bizarre sex(though they would if the studios would ask them to&it would sell),but as long as such productions are non-American,they are viewed as exotic curiosities,which mainstream audience would be occasionally allowed to watch but mainstream cinema never allowed to make.",In the Realm of the Senses
47,maerte,porn for eggheads,6,10 February 2000,"Some people like the inevitable windbag Lacan consider this one of the most intense movies ever made.But let's be honest 104 minutes of intercourse and b*-jobs are a little bit boring, though setting them in traditional Japanese houses may add some exotic flavor for Western spectators. But marvelous Japanese cinematography you can also get from Ozu, Kurosawa and Mizoguchi and they present some more interesting subjects. (6/10)",In the Realm of the Senses
48,aghaemi,You Will Feel Unease Whether You Appreciate The Film Or Not,7,28 August 2014,"Of all the categories of film ones depicting open sex are the most controversial. Trick people, steal their identities, wealth or children, make war, drop bombs or annihilate planets and it is all fine. Show two humans have sex for pleasure and millions will revolt. Although few deny that sex is exciting many assert it is not proper or art. Making the audience feel unsettled, uncomfortable and flinch is part of the intention here. Written and directed by Japan's Nagisa Ôshima's, 1976's In The Realm of Senses (Ai No Korida or 'love's/lover's bullfight') clinches the title as a risqué and explicit art film conceived to break taboos. Here is a film with full sexuality, nudity, penetration, S&M and more whose mission, for starters, is to push the boundaries, promote free speech and deconstruct obscenity. It is pornographic, but directed to be the opposite. Given the imagery and subject matter the film could easily be labelled pornography; however, the presence of respectable/mainstream/traditional cast, crew, studio and production values - not to mention anti-pornographic (pink eiga) film techniques - renders it enough of a something else to confuse most and push the boundary well back. Nagisa Ôshima saw obscenity and censorship as anathema to progress and indeed believed Japan has taken many steps backwards since the days of pleasure quarters, open prostitution in brothels, openness and individuality. His distaste for what he saw as the society's backward march, group-think and suppression of free speech is the driving force behind the feature. Indeed the old geisha who at one point entertains the main characters of this film, when the younger ones ended up refusing to return, proclaims ""that's natural for a woman"" to constantly have sex with a man. Oshima's statement in this regard sheds light on his intent. ""The concept of ""obscenity"" is tested when we dare to look at something that we desire to see but have forbidden ourselves to look at. When we feel that everything has been revealed, ""obscenity"" disappears"" He needed his powers of articulation because - and not for the first time - he would land in court in Japan defending his art. He would live to tell the tale, but to this day the film is only seen in Japan cut, censored and pixelated. The film unequivocally depicts one X-rated sexual act and thought after another. On a mission to make ""obscenity disappear"" one sees complete nudity, sex, an extramarital affair, S&M inclusive of pain inflicted with or without foreign objects (Kichizo: ""it hurts but feels good""), exhibitionism, ingestion, prostitution, promiscuity/free sex, exposure of children and sex with the elderly. Having scratched items off its list the viewer is still ill prepared for the mutilation that follows. Such is the conviction of the writer/director and the ensemble around him. The film does not stop there. Caught in its crosshairs are Japan's pre-World War II militarization, Japanese traditional respect for one's seniors and tradition, male dominance in sex and pornography and crucially man's greater sexual appetite compared to a woman's. Any and all of these concepts would horrify the busybodies that constitute any society anywhere, but even more so in the Japan of 1976 with its induced promotion of group harmony and conformity. Based on a real story dating back to 1936 In The Realm Of Senses retells the story of Sada Abe (played by newcomer Eiko Matsuda) who bedded with her master (Kichizo Ishida played by Tatsuya Fuji) with their ending up stealing away from their lives in a Tokyo inn in Nakano while abandoning his wife. Scandal ensues when their indulgence intensifies amidst everything described above and more. The lovers completely give of themselves. Coincidentally, I had recently watched Akarui Mirai with Tatsuya Fuji who has had an acting career in Japan before and after this feature. It is worth noting this because In The Realm Of Senses features a range of established Japanese talent. Anywhere else in the world and this movie would not have attracted any takers. Apparently, many women had come to audition for a cinematic role, which involves full penetration. The same could not be said about the male talent. The director recounts many were worried about their phallus size or being able to perform on camera. Nonetheless, first there is Oshima's wife, the actress Akiko Koyama. She had volunteered to play Sada, although some speculate it was done to spur other actresses. She plays a geisha here. The old geisha is Kanae Kobayashi. She plays her actual real-life age. She was an established actress notable for the Zatoichi films. The old vagabond is Taiji Tonoyama whose over 200 credits include the brilliant Ningen No Joken (The Human Condition I). The innkeeper is played by established actress Aoi Nakajima herself the daughter of Masayuki Mori known for classics of cinema like Ugetsu or Rashomon. The crew was also an established team working in Kyoto on the set of many a Mizoguchi or Kurosawa film. It is an extraordinarily uninhibited and ground-breaking film. Yet, there are beautiful images of old-style Japanese rooms and decor, traditional outfits, melodies of the shamisen and muted but vivid colours throughout the film which is largely restricted to the indoors. The fox (kitsune) masks of the festival, the kites of the Children's festival and the bird dancer (mimicking the actual bird of earlier) colour the film Japanese further. Nonetheless, these are mere interludes amidst the subversive and often difficult viewing. Amazingly Oshima had sought out the real-life Sada Abe (Sada meaning 'chaste' in Japanese - although her name and the adjective have different Kanji) and obtained her permission to film In The Realm Of Senses. By this time she was ensconced in a Buddhist monastery. Whether one enjoys In The Realm Of Senses or not one has to tip his hat at the courageous and spirited Argos Films, the cast, crew, director, producer and Criterion video.",In the Realm of the Senses
49,mrkramer,Obsessive sexuality on a symbolic level,8,8 February 2001,"This movie surprised me. I went to see it on a whim, because it was showing in the same theatre with a screening of the director's cut of Blade Runner. I didn't know what to expect, and I liked it better than Blade Runner. The sexuality is incredibly graphic, but in some ways, that almost normalizes sex. It is so much better and more interesting than pornography, but it shows what pornography shows. The couple is constantly having sex, but that didn't strike me as abnormal. They do whatever they want regardless of who might be around or watching--a sense of shame and sexual repression is completely absent. There's a dreamy, lazy intensity to their obsession with each other. The end of the movie strikes me as highly symbolic--in that respect, it indicates that sexiness and sexuality is primarily psychological, despite the way they relish each other's bodies.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who liked ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" or ""High Art."" They have a similar psychological intensity.",In the Realm of the Senses

However, that's not all there is.  This is a stylized re-telling of a true story of a disastrous, obsessive love relationship that culminated in the murder and mutilation of one of the partners.  It explores the concept of sexual obsession as an expression of love far more fully and interestingly than any American film I've ever seen, and certainly is far more interesting than your usual modern X-rated flick.

Fortunately, as it turns out, a fictional character from a popular American TV- series sums up my sentiments exactly: STAN MARSH: ""Dude, this is some ****ed up s*** right here!"" I couldn't agree more with Mr. Marsh.I am quite frankly incapable of understanding how anyone anywhere could fail to recognize Oshima's film as a piece of pornography. I do not believe that this opinion makes me a prude; when an over-whelming majority (around 4 of every 5) of the scenes in the film depict graphic non-simulated sex, that means that it is a pornographic motion picture, regardless of how well-shot it is.I consider the film atrocious, and cannot recommend it to anyone anywhere at any time.",In the Realm of the Senses
52,ShaShank_MovieFreak,A Movie That Is Beyond Words.,9,5 March 2012,"In the realm of senses is quite simply a movie like no other. There are simply no words to describe what the movie was like.Without giving away the details, I can say that this movie is about a very obsessive sexual relationship between a man and his servant. So obsessive that they actually don't give a darn about anything that happens. Where their obsession takes them in the end is basically the story of the film. Although the premise seems rather off-beat, the story was handled very well by the director Nagisa Oshima and the actors did a very good job. The art was good and the music was effective enough.The deeper you go into the movie, the deeper the characters go into their sexual unhealthy obsession and the more concerned you become about their fate. This movie is, in NO WAY, a PORNO. You can call it naked art if you want. And yes, the sex was not dry. But who would watch an entire 100 minutes of a movie like this by only focusing on the story? The sex scenes were pretty explicit and real(as in UN-simulated). Still, all of them had their part in the story-telling.Also, one very important point to be considered while trying to interpret this film, if one would want to, is that the story is completely character-driven. Looking at the movie in this perspective helps in a better viewing. The movie goes beyond it's NC-17 rating, but more importantly, the movie goes beyond the day-to-day reality and shows something that is so shocking, so disturbing and so depressing that in the end, you will be left utterly speechless. It is indeed, beyond the realm of senses, showing how related yet far-away, love and sex are.I watched this movie three days ago and it still hasn't left me, quite literally. If not for anything else, watch it for the guts it shows in handling such a daring taboo-breaking subject very well and being very artistic without becoming sleazy and filthy for even one moment.A horribly under-rated masterpiece which only demands an open mind from the user to perform in its fullest.

Normally I am against screen censorship in any form, but In this case I made an exception.The film was egocentric, and deeply boring. At the film society where I saw it we had a record number of walkouts - over 1/2 of the audience left, many of them citing how distasteful it all was, the rest through sheer boredom, but I saw it out, mainly as I was the House Manager that night.It was basically showed all aspects of Human sexuality. I have no objection to this, although watching people parade around naked is quite dull.  What I do object to is the scene which clearly suggests paedophilia. It was cut to show, and I quote, 'The intention but not the act'. The intention is too much. I wish the censor had either cut the scene totally or refused a release. I was physically repulsed.A lot of people accused this of being 'Erotic Art'. If you want erotic art see 'The Pillow Book', its infinitely superior, and a hell of a lot more erotic.

55,Style_is_Substance,It's Bad . . .,3,1 August 2016,"Director Nagisa Ôshima was once quoted saying ""My hatred for Japanese cinema includes absolutely all of it."" These are quite pompous words from someone who has made such a bad film as ""In the Realm of the Senses."" I decided to wait a few weeks to let this film sink in for me so that I am able to develop my thoughts; not only do I now stand by disliking this film, but I have actually grown to detest it more upon contemplation. At the time of this writing, I have not seen any other films by Ôshima, and interestingly, I would not be against it as it is clear he has some talent. Throughout ""In the Realm of the Senses"", the audience can conclude that the film is well made in terms of mise en scène and I would even go as far to call some shots beautiful. The problem I have with the film is not how something is shown, but the context of which what is shown. The film has inspired Gaspar Noé to direct his explicit film Love, which I have previously reviewed and consider to be one of the best films of 2015. This fact and its inclusion on the Criterion Collection drew my interest, however I was quite disappointed. A few minutes in, we see in a rather cringe worthy scene, children throwing snowballs at the private parts of an old man sleeping in the snow only to be followed by the lead character caressing his cold genitals in up- close detail. At this point, I realized the film would be more reminiscent of erotic schlock like ""9½ Weeks"" than it would intelligent psycho- sexual dramas like ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Scenes like this contribute little to nothing to the overall narrative; which the narrative in fact is mostly constructed by one pointless scene after another until it meets the third act where the elements it builds upon actually start to lead somewhere. While the film is admittedly brave in what it chooses to show, it is ultimately aimless and inconsistent. In some scenes, there is conflict between the two regarding unfaithfulness; in others, it is defenestrated. In some scenes, the affair is meant to be kept secret; in others, the two have sex in public. Some scenes are bleak and imply realism, while others are hackneyed and corny including a scene in which an elderly lady watches the two have sex as she laughs and comments on the beauty of youth, which more or less happens twice with two different elderly women. There are at least two scenes of rape, which aids in neither the plot nor the characters it involves. The film's shock value loses its quality and becomes embarrassing. I would say the explicit nature of the film in theory does not upset or offend be, but I'd be lying if I didn't include one scene that legitimately bothers me. This particular scene is fortunately shot from afar and begins with two children (one boy, one girl) playing with each other while randomly running around naked. The boy is stopped by the lead female character who then yanks on his young penis leaving him shouting out that he is hurt by her. Not only does the scene appear to border child molestation and possibly documented abuse, but it also serves absolutely nothing to the story. The film goes on and on like this with interchangeable and ultimately irrelevant scenes for some time.The third act is when the director actually takes the characters somewhere after much worthless malarkey that preceded it. The heightening dangers and perverseness of the characters are displayed in an intimate way as the two engage in the unhealthy taboo of choking one another. The film lacked such intimacy previously between the two leads, and ultimately the greatest scenes within this film is not brought to its fullest potential and feel watered down to me due to its lackluster first two acts leading here. The final moments of the film are fine, just fine. They are nothing special. There could be more buildup leading to its conclusion, but it's ultimately just okay at best at this point. While 2015's Love used this film's aesthetics as an outline to examine a relationship and case study on sex in an entertaining, intelligent, and intimate manner, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" butchers its best moments by settling within its perverse, corny, and shallow qualities. This is truly a bad, ugly, and unintelligent film disguised as something holding special significance.",In the Realm of the Senses
56,FrangipaniMozzie,Fine exploration of sexual jealousy with good erotica and crime elements,7,18 November 2010,"Doing modules on Japanese culture at university I watched this tonight assuming it was an art-house film; it isn't. The film making is most likely standard by Japanese terms i.e. more explicit violence and erotica than most Western films, but no particularly 'arty' film techniques.Nevertheless, it's a good thought provoking look at the issue of sexual jealousy with good characters and plot. Obviously it's not for the faint hearted due to the use of an unusual style of murder and endless sex (which includes the fetish for urine and erotic strangulation which can be a shock to see if you're not turned on by those kinds of things) although despite the shock these may cause to some people, they are necessary devices to convey the plot and theme.As other reviews have noted, the 70s pushed the boundaries of sex and violence in film globally and there is an ambiguity for film reviewers and scholars on whether films like these are just part of the grindhouse phenomenon or actually artistic. In all honesty the amount of crime and sex in this would make it a suitable film for the purpose of crime film viewing or pornography. However it is subtily directed and made to make it look less cheap than some grindhouse movies.

If you want to show love-making, you have to simulate it and not to dive into details, because it diverts audience's attention and corrupts the logical conjunction of scenes. 2- The romantic(?) relationship shown in this film, as the characters confess, is an ""obsession"", not a true love. This kind of passion was disgusting to me. Love is supposed to adorn our lives. Acts like oral sex or inserting a dildo or an egg(!) into a vagina are not arisen from a healthy mind. They are just sadistic and non-appropriate for drama. 3- The scene depicting nude children was questionable. What was director's purpose? It just slowed down the progress of plot, because it had no relation to the story. Also, there is a general rule: Do not use children in erotic scenes. It's meaningless. 4- The rain scene was childish. Why would someone be afraid of an umbrella and think it is a ghost?! Is this funny? Does it help the audience to strengthen their emotional relationships with the characters? I don't think so. 5- The ending is ambiguous.

However, it is unlikely that as many people have heard about this film, which in a totally different way makes perhaps as profound a statement about that topic.In fact, if you see an uncut version of this film, you are in essence watching pornography.  That is, you are watching incredibly graphic sexual content that simply would not be allowed in an American film.  I won't spell it out for you, but I will say this...do you know what they can't show you in American movies?  This one shows that.  And quite a bit more.  This is not the type of sex you would see in a film like ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" or ""Bliss"" or some of the other decent American films about sex (though I can't think of any others).  This is more like the sex shown in ""Last Tango in Paris.""  The characters are so self-destructive and dangerous that the sex (one of the most inherent of all human practices) becomes an expression of their inhumanity.  This is not easy stuff.  But if you are willing to find an uncut version and experience the true power of this film, you may find yourself moved by the things you see.This film blurs the line between pornography and art, and I believe that it stays one inch to the art side, but decide for yourself.

I have seen hard core porn with more of a plot than this crap! I was expecting more of a psychological thriller or a twisted love tale, being that they were suppose to have a sexual obsession for each other and it was based off of a true story.Spoiler Warning!!!!!!!!!! Granted, she was a nymphomaniac, but he acted like he wasn't remotely interested half of the time. Case in point, when she's ""servicing"" him and he lights up a cigarette, what? I kept trying to see something in his face, some sign of life; but it was not there. Not until she still went out tricking.So I understand that is important to the film, neither one of them really could function in society. He was strange, and didn't like his wife, and raped the maid; that kind of thing. And she wasn't adjusted well, she liked to fight, had an obsession with knives apparently and S & M. But when they got together, they still didn't have anything else between them but sex. All of their dialog with each other revolved around it.The part that confused me most, is if she was so in love with him and wanted him in her always, why did she kill him? It didn't look like an accident to me, nor did she act like; she went outside and started mastubating. Then she castrated him. Well maybe it's just me, but it works much better if it's still attached to a ""living"" person.All in all, this movie had no plot, horrible dialog, and no build up. 5 minutes into the film until the last frame was no stop sex and half the time, I didn't know why.

64,Emanef,A quite beautiful film,7,28 March 2004,"I find it a shame that so many people do not have open minds to be able to differentiate such a beautiful, passionate and powerful film from pornography. It is very graphic and explicit, but not 'for the purpose of sexual enjoyment' (the definition of pornography given in my dictionary). In this film, the sex between the two main characters is vital in showing the deeply passionate but ultimately destructive feelings they have for each other - he just wants to please her, and will do anything to do so, even if it means him losing his life.I watched this a few days ago, and it has stayed with me since. It was beautifully filmed. One of the scenes that really stuck in my mind was when the couple were outside in the courtyard, intertwined with her sitting on his lap. The whole courtyard was grey and dour, but she was wearing a rich red robe, which I felt emphasised their passion.I would urge anyone with an interest in cinema to watch this, though obviously you need to be rather open minded to see beyond what most of the people who have posted on here with limited minds were able to see. Why should all sex be smutty or filthy? Sex is a wonderful thing, and this film shows it in a beautiful, powerful and moving way. Although it was ultimately a destructive relationship, the passion between the couple is what most people would only wish to experience in their lives. It was superbly acted, and I really felt like there was something rather special between them.",In the Realm of the Senses
65,tonyw-3,Was it worth it? Not for me.,1,6 November 2000,"So the UK censorship laws have finally relaxed enough for Ai No Corrida to be shown on TV.  On FilmFour, that is - a subscription-only cable and digital channel.  So was it worth watching?  In my opinion, no, it wasn't. Much has been made of the artistic treatment of sex in this film and how it makes reference to repressive Japanese society.  Sorry, but I just couldn't see that at all. All I saw was frequent and rather tawdry coupling, a totally inane ""plot"" and no characterisation at all. I've seen ""adult"" films with a better plot and less pornographic films of much greater eroticism (compare the lumpen use of an egg in Ai No Corrida with the raw egg scene in ""Tampopo"", for example).  At least films classified as pornographic rather than ""artistic"" have the virtue of honesty.  This film was, in my view, self indulgent claptrap.  Having said all that, I applaud the decision of FilmFour to show it.",In the Realm of the Senses

It's profane. It's a film about how our desires can withdraw us from society, reality, or even out own consciousness. We become so obsessed with life, material things, people, and our obsessions can kill us. We become voyeurs when watching this film. The director constantly challenges us to look and to see how the two main characters see each other. The film is a commentary on Japanese society, as we see a woman dominate a man sexually. He withdraws from his position in society and from the military dictatorship that runs Japan. It's truly a beautiful film that succeeds in arousing our mind and our body, and then it challenges us to look deeper into our own place in society, how we withdraw from it, how we escape, and what our escape says about how we view society.",In the Realm of the Senses

Now, at first sight, this might look like a porno but it is NOT. The movie passes on a subtle message from all the scenes outside the bedroom. The message is political and heart-wrenching and tragic and you'll know it when you see this masterpiece.Unlike most movies, The Realm of the Senses uses its sex scenes, which appear about every 2 minutes, to develop the characters and their relationship.The director has created this masterpiece that people shy away from even these days because they heard that it is obscene and, yes, it is. The movie shows things like they were and what happens to Sada Abe (she was real).Go, watch the movie right now and watch the us uncensored version for the best experience.Examples of a few gross scenes: Sada and Kichizo as sitting eating food and Sada says (and I'm quoting here) ""They say that true love means eating food dipped in your lover's juices.""

The extreme results of this true story inspired the making of 'In the Realm of the Senses'.Not everyone will appreciate the straightforward telling of this story. You must be okay with viewing graphic nudity, explicit sex acts and consensual violence. Most countries limit viewing to adults. Some have outlawed it entirely.No English audio exists – just subtitles.Pros include: 1. The uncensored escalation of risks accepted by an over-trusting man. 2. Contextual foundations leading to each scene. This is not director-fantasy pornography. 3. Good acting, cinematography and flow of events.Cons include: 1. The storyline is too narrow. Although sex was exclusively what led to the events, such focus belongs in a documentary format rather than in a traditional movie. 2. Way too visual for today's free audiences. For most people, it likely evokes either abhorrence or sexual arousal, leaving less of the viewer's attention on the story itself (for those who care).OVERALL 6/10: 'In the Realm of the Senses' is A FAIR MOVIE FOR WATCHING ALONE or with like-minded people either a) as porn; or b) for analytical comparisons with crime or religion or psychology.

It's almost a dare from director to audience--how much can you bear to watch, eh? How much sex could the man bear to take? How far gone was Abe Sada's mind? The second time through, I was ready for the hard-boiled egg. I wasn't ready to notice the scene where--in a dream, of course--Ms. Abe molests a child.On a lighter note, when I went to Japan in 1996, I found mentioning Abe Sada's name elicited a humorous reaction even then.

This film was finally passed by the British censors in the early 90's.  It explores every aspect of unhealthy sexual obsession.  From being ""clingy"" to someone, to being bored with someone to the extent that you try to excite the situation with dangerous actions i.e. strangulation games.  Performance wise the film is first rate, especially the performance from Tatsuya Fuji, probably giving the performance of his life.  Director Nagisa Oshima is a man,even to this day,who is not afraid of controversey.  His latest film Gohatto(Taboo)is testament to that,focusing on gay samurai,which is a controversial subject in itself.  In the Realm of the Senses is a very rarely seen film.

It clearly depicts sexuality, nudity and penetration of various sorts. if that suffices for the film to be pornographic then In The Realm Of Senses is porn. If the genre needs exploitation, sex for the sake of sex and entertainment only then this film is not pornographic.Either way, and here is the important point, the film has an important point to make. There are people, actions and rules in our world that do not deserve respect, adherence and all these matters are subjective and subject to individual choice. Just because I believe in one thing it does not follow that someone else must live their life according to that point-of-view. All options are on the table.In The Realm Of Senses clearly tries to insult and shock as many people as possible to make a point. The point is well made and the majority of viewers (or would-be viewers) would be aghast at the work. It is the beauty of the film.

79,pillok-2,Groundbreaking and unique. Yet strangely forgotten.,10,23 July 2000,"It has been described as the Japanese Last Tango in Paris- a fair comparison. For both films explore in a truly raw and puissant manner the sexuality and psychology of sex. Ai No Corrida is an overwhelming experience, if for nothing else than its sheer audacity. But Corrida is so much more than sex. It delves into a shrouded netherworld of experimentation and pain. The world of De Sade.Yet it is not turgid or depraved; it is not repugnant or diabolical. It is a poetic voyage into the unknown. It is about the search for pure fulfillment and pleasure. Nothing else in the world presented matters, reality is discarded. And thus the cause for the tragedy which ensues.The two protagonists separate themselves from all that is real for they know that to find true happiness they must transcend all levels of reality and consciousness to a mighty plane. But such a place is transient. Yet the few glorious moments in such a world are worth any heartache that follows.It was a film ahead of its time and I believe that it is still. The sparse few in the audience snickering and snorting confirmed this. It is one of those films whose reputation has preceded it and is so well known in Arthouse circles that disappointment may be said to be inevitable. But this film lives up to its reputation. For it is a truly explicit and daring film as it challenges the common perception that happiness is conformity. It proposes that true happiness is unobtainable in this world and to gain it you must sacrifice the flesh, to forward and improve the soul.Yet this film made twenty-four years ago has been forgotten in the industry for where is its influence, its mark? Few films have used pornography in such a way since. And sex is still relegated to the flea-pit cinemas and backstreet shops. Arthouse films which depict sex, even those which do so explicitly, present it as the result of the character's exploration or development. As a curiosity, or as symbolic of the ascension of a particular player. Corrida uses sex to forward the plot, to illustrate the personalities of its protagonists, to symbolize everything in their fragile society. Sex is the plot development, sex is the key player and sex is the message. The sex takes centre stage. Each new scene is the result of sex, not vice versa.This truly original concept has never taken hold. Why not? Surely the Arthouse circuit would realize the potential and milk it dry. And yet Corrida and a handful of others are the only films to take advantage.
This is why Ai No Corrida is a masterpiece. The acting, the direction, script etc... are all brilliant. But the ideas and concepts and invention are what makes Corrida one of the most superb films ever made. A film unknown except to those in the Arena. A film which took no hold, was as distant and mysterious as the world it depicted. A fleeting landmark that should have shook the world; but, maybe rightly, will always remain a forgotten treasure.",In the Realm of the Senses

I just want to say that this kind of movie is worth watching as it has a particular plot since it is divided into several branches which developed as the movie (and relationship) progresses.I recommend Ai No Korida because it's a movie that's very interesting to watch and makes you think. I would also recommend it because the movie (even though it is a little too short) is surprisingly fresh and outstanding to this day. Mainstream audiences and weak folk won't like it.

81,elpachuco,Flat and weak to be based on a true-life story,6,8 June 2003,"Nagisa Oshima's ""Ai no corrida"" (1976) was based on a controversial true story in which a former geisha mutilated her lover's penis and was arrested wandering on the streets with it. Usually, true-story-based movies are dramatized to make the plot more intriguing and interesting.""Ai no corrida"" is a weakly-constructed story located on 1930's Japan in which a sexual - servant girl Sada (Eiko Matsuda) involves madly with her master Kichi-zo (Tatsuya Fuji) to the point where love-making becomes violent and dangerous.The movie is interesting at first because it doesn't stop where erotica movies often do (you get really, I mean really explicit images of sex), but fails later on in making the experience interesting (you don't get touched or aroused like you may do with Jean-Jacques Annaud's  ""L'Amant""(1991)). After you get familiar with all the explicit visuals, the story doesn't get any better because all that happens is uninspiring, tediously-told sex.  Ai no corrida's photography and art are nice though. Acting is great, specially on the really explicit sexual scenes where actors really make love and go all the way. But generally, everything is slow and flat. Many people got out from the theatre when I watched it, I don't know if it was the dullness or the explicit content.As for the art or porn debate, I wouldn't call ""Ai no corrida"" a porn flick. A porn movie is usually low budget and usually made with strict commercial purposes. Nagisa Oshima took the time to construct a story  (not a very structured one in my opinion but he did write a story) based on real-life facts and made a movie with it making statements on the way.Even if the story is a little dull, you  must watch it for its ""cult-movie"" status and because it is interesting to see that sex, even though carried out by other cultures, can turn into a dangerous obsession.",In the Realm of the Senses

This traditional couple in 30's Japan spirals into a sexual affair of more and more addiction to the Bliss that never arrives to satisfy their craving, set to a backdrop of the military buildup of the Japanese invasion of Korea and China in the mid thirties.That the affair ends with the man's death, while attempting the ultimate orgasm as she pulls a cord tightly around his neck, is so obvious a comment on Japanese history that I wonder how anyone can call this an erotic film. True, there are crafted and beautiful scenes of uncensored sex, but these only draw us into their deeper world, ( by our own voyeurism and curiosity) before their demise and that of Japan are finally delivered in the final scenes. Interestly the film was financed in France and not released in Japan in the seventies.It was not given a certificate in England , and was shown at a cinema where, for legal reasons, the audience had to join a film club to see it.

When I first saw the movie I, like some other reviewers, regarded the final outcome as an act of sadomasochism carried to the ultimate degree through pure sexual frenzy. But, like Taylor's novel, it is ultimately a profound love story that may be pornographic in its graphic representation of extreme sexual activity, but it remains undeniably a work of art in the way it explores the extremes of love and the insecurity that can attend it (an insecurity some people may label as jealousy, but which I think is much more than that). What I missed the first time was that the man's act of allowing himself to be dismembered by his mistress was more than the act of a submissive going to the extremes of submission. It was the only way he could assuage the terrible insecurity of his mistress and prove his love for her once and for all.

91,Chri7,Awakened female self-consciousness and self-destruction,10,4 October 2017,"In the film IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES by Oshima Nagisa, we can not catch a trace of similarity to those cliché love stories where Romeo and Juliet show their affections implicitly and finally get together, pushing aside all obstacles and difficulties. Instead, there is extraordinarily explicit, intense, and stimulating lust between the two characters, who ""do virtually nothing but pursue their sexual desires""(Peter Lehman). The carnal sexuality, as the main theme of the film, implies two sides of a coin: ideally returning to Eden where one can obey the instinctive desires and lightheartedly indulge in sexual pleasure, as well as suffering from Coitum Animal Triste – great void and solitude after extreme pleasure of orgasms. As Sada irresistibly drown in lust, deeper and deeper, she at last heads towards destruction with her lover.In the realm of sensory pleasure, Kichi, as a masculine and patricentric symbol, is put in a weak position throughout; hence Sada's aggressive and possessive passion for sex becomes the symbol of awakened female self-consciousness. It reminds me of another film, Joi Niku Dorei (1986) by Katsuhiko Fuji. In this Japanese pink film, Kumi, a beautiful doctor, married her colleague Kitame. A misleading sex tape in which the heroine looks exactly like Kumi soon ruins their idyllic marriage, sent anonymously. Kitame thinks Kumi betrayed him, and thence has sex with the misconceived wife with brutalities and humiliations ever after. In the end of the film, with all misunderstandings resolved, Kumi turns down Kitame's begging for forgiveness. In a hotel room, she masturbates to orgasm in front of a DV she bought for herself, then wanders around Tokyo streets aimlessly. The film ends with a reflection of Kumi's pretty but slightly flurried face on a showcase filled with televisions in an electronics store. Trauma and lust changes Kumi, a conventionally gentle and virtuous wife, into an independent woman who discerns and pursues her instinctive desire. In other words, the sex-tape incident awakes Kumi.In the context of women's sexual pleasure relying on pleasing men, Kumi and Sada resist male supremacy through sexuality. The difference is Sada opens to her desire at the very beginning, with the will and determination towards self-destruction.La petite mort, meaning ""the little death"", is a French euphemism for orgasm. Ecstasy during transient orgasm does have resemblances with death: they are both extreme experience. In the end of the film, Sada strangles Kichi to death and cut off his genital. She regards it as the only way towards eternal sexuality, and in this way she and Kichi can be together forever. Death, self-destruction, and lust, seems to be Sada's final redemption.Explicit sex scenes in the film are astonishing. In his book, Running Scared: Masculinity and the Representation of the Male Body, Peter Lehman argues the difference between erotic traditions of ancient East and modern West. Lehman enumerates several features in western hard-core pornography: invariably erect penises, men ejaculating on women's faces, and moaning and groaning of women in ecstasy; either symbolizes man power or centrality of male sexuality. In this case, ""women's pleasure becomes fetishized, not valued"". Contrarily in In the Realm of Senses, Sada's sexual satisfaction is the only thing that Kichi values, as he says ""No. But if it pleases you, yes,"" when Sada asks if he really wants she to strangle him. There are many shots of Kichi's flaccid average-size penis, and Sada always moans as an expression of her own pleasure.In the Realm of Senses is a significant masterpiece, on account of both its extremely sensual, erotic, and romantic story and its distinction comparing with western hard-core pornography – it stands for women's desires.",In the Realm of the Senses

The cultural differences makes the movie a must see alone; it has moments of hard core porn, and is definitely not for the squeamish or those with easily offended mindsets. In fact, one scene, with blatant kiddie porn, could not be filmed today.
