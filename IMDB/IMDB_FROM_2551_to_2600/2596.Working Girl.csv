0,SnoopyStyle,fun 80s fashion in good 80s rom-com,7,12 December 2013,"Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) is a smart, plucky, investment worker. She tries to climb the corporate ladder, but she's constantly held back by the sexist environment, and her night school college degree. When she is assigned to be Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver)'s secretary, she hoped that things would finally change. She shares a business idea with Katharine. When she finds that Katharine is claiming the idea for herself, Tess takes matters into her own hands.The subject matter, the style, and the humor is pure 80's. The hair is insane. And there is no accounting for the fashion. It is jaw dropping and unintentionally funny.As for the story, it's a fairly good happy rom-com from veteran director Mike Nichols. This is possibly Melanie Griffith's best work. She has just enough pluckiness and is a complete sweetheart. Sigourney Weaver is showing her comedic chops. And Harrison Ford is actually a great rom-com leading man.",Working Girl
1,mark.waltz,"Let the rivers run, both the East and the Hudson, as the underdog scores.",8,10 March 2017,"Upon first glance of executive Sigourney Weaver, you half expect her to be the hard nosed bitch boss to work for, and when Melanie Griffith gets the job as her new secretary, she's flabbergasted by Weaver's instant good nature. But this woman is a phony, and it's fun to watch Weaver be exposed for all her passive/aggressive niceness that is really more fake than most Hollywood starlet's hair colors. This is the big corporate world of New York City where finding how to succeed in business can really bring you instant enemies through the petty jealousies that take over the human soul. Griffith's just been fired for her humiliation for a sexually aggressive male executive at her previous firm, and her employment agent (Olympia Dukakis in an amusing cameo) gives her one last chance with a very strict warning that it will be her last chance.In her new company, she's made privy to every inside secret that Weaver knows, and it appears that this seemingly great lady is mentoring her for something beyond being a secretary. When Griffith takes Weaver's offer of sharing her opinions of how to advertise, Weaver turns it around and makes it her own idea, and that brings upon initial shock then revenge as the seemingly ditzy Melanie turns the tables, both personally and professionally, going after Weaver's man (Harrison Ford) as well. She pretends to be an executive with the same firm to get close to Ford and pretty soon, they are sharing more than just business meetings. But deception is always exposed, and for both Weaver and Griffith, one will fall and one will rise based upon that deception.This is so funny and true, and having worked in corporate America for over 20 years, I have seen many archetypes of all of these characters. Weaver delivers one of the most glamorous and funny performances of all time, so sunny and welcoming, but with a glint of evil behind that offer of mentoring. Griffith is massively surprising, with that wisp of a voice making you not take her seriously, and forced to look at your own prejudices because of your pre-judgement of her. As she shows how smart she is (hidden by the insecurities that those with better education has obviously impacted her with), she becomes more clear to watch, to like, to admire. Joan Cusack is the zany best friend who gets some great Eve Arden like cracks, while Alec Baldwin is Griffith's sleazy boyfriend, as oily as any cheater can be. Ford underplays a great deal, knowing he's in a woman's picture. This may be the dirty word ""chick flick"", but it is one that men with open minds can enjoy and watch over and over. Thanks to the Carly Simon opening theme, this scores a big A+, and in the final scene when Griffith scores her big triumph, there is a great moment that every lady executive should look to as they climb the ladder of success which until a few decades ago was mostly a man's world.",Working Girl
2,gavin6942,This Was An Oscar Nominee?,6,6 July 2016,"When a secretary (Melanie Griffith)'s idea is stolen by her boss (Sigourney Weaver), she seizes an opportunity to steal it back by pretending she has her boss' job.The 1980s were a strange decade, and this film proves it. Apparently you can make a movie about bad hair and funny voices, and get multiple Oscar nominations -- including Best Picture. I didn't actively start watching the Oscar nominees until around 2010, but I can't see this one being in the same league as any of those...Not saying this is a bad movie, mind you. The plot is pretty decent (and has that 80s ""big business"" motif going on). I always like seeing Harrison Ford, especially before he starting looking like a grandfather who chases teen girls. (Ford is 15 years older than Griffith, but it's not as obvious in this movie.)",Working Girl
3,lee_eisenberg,How could Mike Nichols do this to us?!!!!!!!!!!,1,11 February 2006,"Like the dreadful ""Flashdance"" a few years earlier, ""Working Girl"" makes it look like anyone can rise to the top through sheer perseverance. YEAH RIGHT. Why did Mike Nichols, after ""The Graduate"", ""Catch-22"", ""Carnal Knowledge"" and ""Silkwood"", degenerate into this? Even Ed Wood's movies, while completely moronic, weren't insulting. ""Working Girl"", on the other hand, wastes three perfectly capable leads - not to mention several supporting players - on a fairy tale (and not the kind that the brothers Grimm wrote). Whereas ""Wall Street"" took a serious look at the corporate world, this makes a mess of everything. How tragic that Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver had to meet in that part of the World Trade Center destroyed on September 11; it means that that spot can only be known for this swill.",Working Girl
4,jboothmillard,Working Girl,7,25 May 2008,"From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Mike Nichols (The Graduate, The Birdcage, Closer), this is quite an interesting comedy film looking at how feminism can affect the work place. Basically Tess McGill (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Melanie Griffith) becomes a secretary/personal assistant for Katharine Parker (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver), but when Katharine breaks her leg while on a work trip/vacation (whichever) Tess takes over her business. While doing this she is bossed about quite a lot by Weaver (on the phone, and eventually when she gets back), and she meets and falls for broker Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford). In the process of having this relationship, Tess climbs the corporate ladder to success, and in the end, Katharine is seen as the bitch she is by her superior, and Tess gets a proper job with her own secretary and office. Also starring Alec Baldwin as Mick Dugan, Oscar nominated Joan Cusack as Cyn, Philip Bosco as Oren Trask, Nora Dunn as Ginny, Funny Bones' Oliver Platt as Lutz, James Lally as Turkel, young Kevin Spacey as Bob Speck, Robert Easton as Armbrister, Olympia Dukakis as Personnel Director, Amy Aquino as Alice Baxter, Jeffrey Nordling as Tim Rourke, Elizabeth Whitcraft as Doreen DiMucci, Zach Grenier as Jim, Lee Dalton as John Romano, Barbara Garrick as Phyllis Trask, Madolin B. Archer as Barbara Trask and David Duchovny as Tess's Birthday Party Friend. It didn't make me laugh that much in many places, and there were a few moments where I lost track of what was going on, but the performances are good, and you do root for Griffith's character. It won the nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Film Score for singer Carly Simon, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Original Song (together with ""Two Hearts"" from Buster (1988)), and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Carly Simon's Oscar winning ""Let The River Run"" was number 91 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 91 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 87 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",Working Girl
5,rmax304823,Cinderella and the Class Slipper.,7,13 July 2003,"Harrison Ford is an ordinary actor with a limited range but a genuinely nice guy. How can you dislike someone who claims in interviews that, as an actor he is Irish, but as a man he is Jewish. (The best of two possible worlds.) Sigourney Weaver projects intelligence in whatever part she plays and whatever else the part calls for: crawling fear (""Copycat""), determination (""Alien""), or, as here, a kind of good-natured bitchiness. Joan Cusack is magnificent in a supporting role.This is a somewhat delicate comedy with serious undertones. We have Melanie Griffith as a 30-year-old unmarried working-class woman (not that much is made of her despair along those lines). She poses as her treacherous boss, Weaver, and snags both the business deal she proposed and the high-class man she is destined for.In ""The Benny Goodman Story,"" Benny's mother, an anti-Gentile (there is no word for such a sentiment because politically it's unspeakable), tells her son, a nice Jewish musician who is falling in love with -- hold on -- a Shiksa, that ""Bagels and caviar don't mix."" We have the same serious undertones here. Can a working-class girl whose primary source of news about world events is the magazine ""W"" marry and live happily ever after with Harrison Ford, a fast-lane mergers and acquisitions expert, instead of Alec Baldwin whose tastes run to scotch and floozies? (Oh, sob.)Well -- yes, they can. Or I think they can, anyway. I forgot the question.I ate bagels and caviar once and it wasn't bad. Except -- if I may speak frankly -- the bagels weren't as good as those from Watson's on Bergen Street in Newark. They weren't HARD enough. They were what I once heard a child call ""round bread.""Anyway back to the movie. It's nicely written. And entirely miscast except for Sigourney Weaver and Joan Cusack. Harrison Ford is no comedic actor, I'm afraid. And Melanie Griffith doesn't show the testosterone kind of vigor that the part demands. It's not the performers' faults. They've been good in other parts. But what's required here is a faster pace from the director and the editor. Everyone seems to speak too slowly, even when the lines weep with the desire to be spat out unthinkingly. And there are moony longueurs in which we watch Griffith standing alone in the fog on the deck of the Staten Island Ferry. The music, a subdued version of ""The New Jerusalem"", sniffles along with her.Well, what is all that stuff doing here? It has the potential of being a great comedy. It's got stuff that goes back to Aristophanes and before -- mixed identities, sex, everything. And we get a rather slow story of One Woman's Heartbreak. What was needed was a director like Howard Hawks and a cultural milieu in which the seriousness of the theme could be inherent in its comedic values. If you want an example of what I'm getting at, try Hawks' ""Monkey Business,"" a thoroughly hilarious comedy based on one of the most serious themes -- the break-up of a bourgeois marriage. ""Working Girl"" has some very good moments but they are based on the script, not the direction or acting. You know who should get some kind of award? Wardrobe and Hair Dressing. My Bog -- those dos the working-class girls wear early on, like bishops' miters. One's eyes are glued to those impenetrable crowns whenever they're on screen.Griffith gets her man, a job, and prestige. It isn't that greed is good, so much as that standing by your principles in the advancement of self is good. ""You make it happen."" I think we can all agree with that, although with a smile that suggests wry bread more than a bagel.",Working Girl
6,Tweekums,A feel-good '80s comedy,8,28 March 2018,"Early in this film secretary Tess McGill has moved to a new job. Her new boss is Katharine Parker, who works in Mergers and Acquisitions at a New York company. She seems friendly and encourages Tess to pitch in with her ideas. Tess does this when she suggests that a firm which is looking to acquire a television station might be better off getting a radio station instead. She is soon told that the company weren't interested but is still complimented for the idea. After Katherine breaks a leg while skiing Tess learns that far from dropping the radio plan Katherine had stolen it. Tess then sets about setting up the deal by contacting investment broker Jack Trainer; of course she doesn't tell him she is 'only' a secretary. All goes fairly well but inevitably Katherine eventually finds out and accuses Tess of stealing the idea. This film is a lot of fun; the plot holds few surprises but that isn't a problem as it isn't the stort of film where one expects twists. Despite only appearing third on the cast list this is definitely Melanie Griffith's film; she is rarely off screen and is a delight as Tess; a character one can't help rooting for. Harrison Ford is on fine form as Jack and Sigourney Weaver impresses as the duplicitous Katharine. The romantic subplots are handled well and don't feel forced; they also provide quite a few laughs. The film has aged pretty well; only the huge '80s hair really dates things! Overall I'd say this may be fairly light weight but it is a lot of fun and well worth watching.",Working Girl
7,moonspinner55,"""If you wanna be taken seriously, you need serious hair.""",5,18 January 2007,"Bubbly New York fantasy set in the advertising business world gives Melanie Griffith her finest couple of hours as an actress. Put-upon secretary, involved in a disheartening relationship with a jerk, finds the opportunity to improve both her work situation and her love life when she masquerades as her own boss and teams with a handsome business exec to land a major account. Mike Nichols-directed fluff has some wincing, mean-spirited jokes and a female ""boss from hell"", played by Sigourney Weaver, whom we never quite understand (she's sneaky and she's shallow, but is she vicious? and does she deserve the harsh treatment the screenwriter levels on her?). Griffith seemingly had her role as Tess tailored to her innate, golly-gee perkiness, and she has some very fine scenes with leading man Harrison Ford and gal-pal Joan Cusack, but the gist of the plot (attempting to sell a conglomerate on radio advertising) seems a bit thin, and the wrap-up is pure sitcom. ** from ****",Working Girl
8,edwagreen,Working Girl Works Its Way into Your Heart ***1/2,9,13 June 2011,"Very good film about a young lady, going to night school to get her degree, and further understanding a business career. Melanie Griffith is absolutely delightful in the lead role as that girl. She sees that along the way, you need a push to get ahead and also be at the right places at the right time under the correct circumstances with the people in the know. She also sees a tyrannical boss (Sigourney Weaver) who will take advantage of you and even borrow your great ideas to accomplish her own goals.Harrison Ford is great as the man in the corporate world, who also is attached to the Weaver character. Philip Bosco is the big boss you want to please and Alec Baldwin, so young and thin, represents the life Griffith wants to get away from.The wonderful film is almost a more serious ""How to Succeed"" type of picture. Griffith and Weaver were nominated for Oscars as best actress and supporting actress, respectively.",Working Girl
9,sunwarrior13,A Great Corporate Tale,9,27 October 2016,"Working Girl is an 80's romantic dramedy that tells the story of a secretary from Staten Island who manages to rise to become a Wall Street executive working on mergers and acquisitions.It stars Harrison Ford,Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver.This film is directed by the talented Mike Nichols.Tess McGill feels unsatisfied with her job and her loser boyfriend which led her to resign from her work and dump him as well.Earning a Business degree from evening classes,he decides to take a post in Wall Street as a secretary.When her boss Katharine Parker become unavailable,she decides to take her post unofficially due to the circumstances surrounding their company.She starts to work with mergers and acquisitions.She also wins the heart of another executive named Jack.Things does not look promising after Katharine returns.She accuses Tess of stealing her ideas but later it was revealed otherwise which led to Katherine's dismissal from the company.It ends with Tess finally getting an ""entry-level"" position and being in a happy relationship with Jack.This is a great corporate tale the features women on top especially during the 1980's when more and more women have decided to become more ambitious by attaining higher positions in companies by becoming executives.Its themes of whether women are capable of becoming executives maybe dated after 28 years but it is still funny today due its great cast especially Melanie Griffith who provided a strong performance as Tess.Also,it is a smart movie too which has all the necessities into becoming a great 80's film.",Working Girl

11,hitchcockthelegend,Delightful uplifting tale for any decade.,8,4 March 2008,"Firstly let me say that I'm stunned at the mediocre rating this film has on this site, secondly I disagree with those users who say the film is too 80s and hasn't aged well because it's central theme fits into any time frame, it is in fact universal in life.On the surface the film appears to only operate purely as a romantic feel good movie, but scratch away the surface and you find that a great deal of intelligence is coursing thru the veins of this Mike Nichols effort. Dealing with the harshness of trying to get on in the world of business, I found that the film is saying that grit and determination can get you breaks if you have the brains to seize the opportunity, be strong and maybe you can prosper, now it may not always be the case that such endeavours are rewarded, but at least you can say you tried.A never better Melanie Grifith plays Tess McGill with much heart and passion, and I'm sure that is in no small part down to the adroit people skills that director Mike Nicholls obviously has. Sigourney Weaver & Joan Cusack are equally impressive, with Weaver seeming to relish the role of dastardly boss woman Katharine Parker, whilst Harrison Ford is simply spot on as the love interest with the smart business acumen helping Tess in her quest to make it in the often harsh world of business.A film with appeal for both sexes, and this particular macho viewer punched the air at the end in appreciation for a fitting finale, good work all round here, 8/10.",Working Girl
12,grantss,Entertaining,7,9 April 2016,"Entertaining comedy-drama. Ending is a bit Hollywoodish but the setup and plot development are good. Also has a bit of female-corporate-empowerment message, though not a very powerful one.Solid performance from Melanie Griffith in the lead role. Signourney Weaver, especially, and Harrison Ford outperform Griffith though. Decent support performances from Joan Cusack and Alec Baldwin. Interesting to note that the cast includes Kevin Spacey, Olympia Dukakis and Oliver Platt in minor roles and David Duchovny in a very minor, fleeting, role.",Working Girl
13,evanston_dad,Career Women with Big Ideas and Even Bigger Hair,8,27 July 2008,"A pure fantasy served up by Mike Nichols, but a vastly entertaining one.Melanie Griffith is the secretary with massive hair who pretends to be a corporate business woman when her boss is layed up with a broken leg. The catch is, she finds out she's pretty good at it, and things get complicated when she ends up spearheading a business deal and falling in love with her key partner (Harrison Ford), all the while trying to keep what she's doing from her boss (Sigourney Weaver). It's the kind of movie that could just as easily have been made as a screwball comedy in the 1940s, perhaps with Barbara Stanwyck in the lead role.The film is a classic in its own small way, one of the best comedies to emerge from the 1980s. Griffith is matched well with her role, so her limitations as an actress don't draw too much attention to themselves. But it's Weaver who steals the show as Griffith's imperious boss. She's a riot as a confident and powerful career woman from hell. And Joan Cusack steals a few scenes of her own as Griffith's best friend and fellow secretary, who sports hair as big as Griffith's and a Joisy accent to boot.Nichols knows how to direct a comedy so that the funny bits speak for themselves.Grade: A",Working Girl
14,Uriah43,Love and Drama in the Big Apple,7,17 October 2018,"""Tess McGill"" (Melanie Griffith) is a hard-working woman who is trying to climb the corporate ladder but can't seem to get anybody to give her a fair chance. So after being fired from her current position at a Wall Street investment firm for refusing to sleep with her boss's friend she is assigned to work as a secretary for a female business executive named ""Katherine Parker"" (Sigourney Weaver). At first, Tess likes her new situation as Katherine promises to mentor her so that she can achieve her goals. However, her admiration for her new boss changes when Tess learns that Katherine has recently stolen one of her ideas and is in the process of promoting it as her own. So when Katherine is temporarily side-lined with a broken leg Tess decides to take matters into her own hands and advance the idea on her own. And to do that she turns to an investment broker named ""Jack Trainer"" (Harrison Ford) who is skilled in the art of finance and can help her close the deal. What she doesn't count on is the budding romance between them-or the fact that Jack just happens to be Katherine's boyfriend. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I liked the chemistry between Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford and thought that both of them performed their roles in an excellent manner. Likewise, Sigourney Weaver was equally effective as the vicious boss from hell that believes that rules and ethics don't apply in her case. Be that as it may, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic-comedy of this type and have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Working Girl
15,Mr-Fusion,The stars align and the movie clicks,7,13 October 2016,"""Working Girl"" is one of those movies I've put off for years; and I guess it's partly because I'd known it as a romantic comedy, but mostly because I've never been a Melanie Griffith fan.Turns out she's the movie's best feature, fitting well as an ambitious secretary who can't get ahead, someone who takes the corporate ladder by force. Actually, all three of the stars were ideal, but Ford and Weaver seemed to be supporting Griffith. She just seemed to embody that empowered career woman who sheds her mousy constraints.And it is a romantic comedy, but a subtle one. The humor is expressed in the dialogue and I found myself laughing more than I'd expected. It's an '80s movie down to its very DNA and pretty much everything about it still holds up.7/10",Working Girl

17,JamesHitchcock,Dick Whittington on Wall Street,7,7 December 2007,"Like ""Wall Street"", which came out the previous year, ""Working Girl"" is set in the world of world of high finance, but whereas ""Wall Street"" is a satire on greed and corruption (it famously invented the phrase ""greed is good""), ""Working Girl""- a romantic comedy set in a big Wall Street corporation- takes a more positive view of the capitalist system.The main character is Tess McGill, one of the corporation's employees. Tess works as a secretary, but is ambitious to rise higher within the corporate hierarchy, especially as she has just turned thirty and has realised that her boss, Katharine Parker, is slightly younger than her. (In reality, Sigourney Weaver is eight years older than Melanie Griffith, but she looks attractive enough to make this plausible). Tess, however, is held back by her lack of formal qualifications and by her working-class origins, which are betrayed by her accent, by her clothes and most of all by her hairstyle. (To say that Tess has Big Hair would be an understatement; make that Enormous Hair).At first Tess's relationship with Katharine is a friendly one. Encouraged by her boss, Tess even starts suggesting possible deals on behalf of the firm's clients. Things change, however, when Katharine breaks her leg on a skiing holiday and is forced to take time off work. During Katharine's absence, Tess discovers that her boss has stolen one of her ideas- involving the takeover of a radio network by a client company- and is trying to pass it off as her own. Outraged, Tess decides to try a deception of her own. With the aid of a new hairstyle and Katharine's smart business suits she passes herself off as an executive in the firm and tries to put the deal together. (Tess can't do much about her Staten Island accent, but no-one seems to notice). In the process she meets, and falls for, Jack, a handsome executive with the client company- who just happens to be Katharine's fiancé.I must admit that Melanie Griffith has not always been my favourite actress. Her breathless, little-girl voice served her well as a teenager in films like ""The Drowning Pool"", but can sound irritating for a woman in her thirties. ""Working Girl"", however, is one of her best performances. (It deservedly brought her only Oscar nomination). The plot has some similarities with another Griffith film from a few years later, ""Born Yesterday"". In both films Griffith plays a working-class girl who is assumed to be dumb, but who proves to be a lot more intelligent and resourceful than anyone gave her credit for.The film also showed us a new facet to Harrison Ford's talents, as he played the hero of a romantic comedy for the first time. This was not only his first venture into this particular genre, but also probably his best- I was never too impressed by his attempt to re-create the Humphrey Bogart role in ""Sabrina"" or by ""Six Days, Seven Nights"". His steady, dependable and decent screen persona, however, serves him well in ""Working Girl"". Weaver makes a suitably detestable- if desirable- villainess as the devious Katharine, and Joan Cusack gives a good performance as Tess's friend and confidante. There are also some similarities with ""Pretty Woman"", another romantic comedy from two years later with a Wall Street background. Neither film might please a strict moralist; indeed, many moralists took great exception to ""Pretty Woman"" on the grounds that the Julia Roberts character is a ""working girl"" in the other sense of the term. In the case of this film, the moralists would insist that two wrongs do not make a right and ask why Tess is treated as the heroine when she is just as guilty of deception as Katharine is. Such moralists would miss the point of both films, which give new twists to old stories. ""Pretty Woman"" is a modern dress version of the Cinderella legend about the poor girl who falls in love with a prince. ""Working Girl"" casts the heroine in a less passive role- one who achieves success through her own efforts rather than through winning the love of a powerful man. The working class girl ends up on top, while the Ivy League-educated yuppie is cast as the villainess. It is essentially the Dick Whittington story with a modern setting and a woman in the leading role, a poor girl rather than boy making good.I also liked Carly Simon's theme song, ""Let the River Run"", even though it did not seem to have much connection with the story. 7/10",Working Girl

Director Nichols crafts a charming and sweetly sentimental Yuppie-era girl-makes-good tale with good old school Hollywood style in this much lauded film which is a break-through for Griffith with early peeks at Kevin Spacy, Oliver Platt, and Ricki Lake and a poignant look at the Manhattan skyline behind rolling credits. A fun blast from the past on the broadcast circuit.",Working Girl
20,blanbrn,"A Cinderella and fairy tale of underdog success, and a sexy and all time best performance from Melanie Griffith.",9,30 December 2008,"Mike Nichols in 1988 certainly had one of the better films both critically and commercially as ""Working Girl"" clearly captured the times of the late 1980's well. As seen in the film by showing New York City's rat race, big hair, skirts, and high heels along with the cold and toughness of the cut throat big business world. Yet it is most remembered and respected for the acting especially the sexy and sweet performance of Melanie Griffith as a down on her luck secretary who finds success in a most uncommon way. Melanie is in her greatest role ever as Tess McGill a 30 year old secretary in the big apple who wants to find success and move up the corporate ladder yet she knows and will see that many roads are blinding and full of pit falls.Finally when she starts working for a witch of a boss the classy and elegant yet sarcastic and cold Katharine Parker(Sigourney Weaver), Tess is clearly at first an office slave. Yet her luck will change when as by happen chance and fate while as Katharine is gone away on a ski trip she suffers an injury. Therefore this opens the door for a window of success for Tess. As at first her idea of a merger was rejected, yet she will later find thru open eyes and open ears her merger idea was oddly enough stolen so therefore Tess becomes eager and ambitious enough to fight back with her big thoughts and dreams.Basically Tess takes on the role of Katharine by moving in to dressing into her wardrobe and even attending parties! Now enter the real triangle of the film enter a handsome investment banker Jack Trainer(Harrison Ford who always gives us good performances) this meeting of visual lust turns to romance and passion for Tess will this take her and her merger thought to the top or will her plans be revealed and will it finish off her work life and love? Also noted are some good supporting performances from Joan Cusack as the best friend of Tess and Alec Bladwin was okay as the cheating boyfriend of Tess. And Kevin Spacey very young in his acting days has a short appearance as a cocaine snorting womanizer. Griffith's performance is beautiful her best ever especially since the role was that of a down on her luck underdog fighting for success. Plus her performance was very sexy especially those lingerie scenes were very memorable especially the one of her in that black strapless bra! Overall ""Working Girl"" is one of the best films of the 80's even though it seems like a fairy tale it's theme of an underdog obtaining success is well remembered and liked. Remembered it's not always how hard you work, many times those who gain the most have their eyes open at the right time and ear volume turned up just right! Great film to watch many times and a must view to see the performance of Melanie Griffith.",Working Girl
21,lasttimeisaw,Working Girl,7,12 January 2012,"However outdated the costumes and settings, outmoded the corporal cooperation business, I believe the ethic of WORKING GIRL is abiding, at least until this moment (24 years later), resembling a 1980s version of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006), however collected 6 Oscar nominations with 1 win (for Carly Simon's theme song LET THE RIVER RUN) at its time (including the weighty BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and 3 acting nominations), we may hark back to the oldie saying ""Miracle happens!"". I watched the film twice in a row, and its sensational effect of its initial release may have been bleached by an eon 24 years of our generation, but I appreciate the film in conspiring an ingenious plot of this crowd-pleasing dramedy, Melanie Griffith's role effectively resonates with a widely broad working class not only in 1988 but also nowadays (white collar office suit probably). The cast is excellent as well, many complain Griffith's deficiency in stretch as an actress, but Mike Nichols surely helped her to dig into a full blown, a hardball hidden inside her feeble flesh (the nude or underwear scenes are just expendable bravura though). Billed as a comedy, which admittedly is not Griffiths-Ford pair's strong suit, Weaver and Cusack bulges out for the rescue, both I adore so much in the film (Weaver was a double nominee that year, and I think it deserves my win at least in the supporting category, haven't seen GORILLAS IN THE MIST 1988 yet).WORKING GIRL is clearly not the BEST PICTURE material gauged by the current Oscar barometer (Mike Nichols' big name helped then, which failed to push CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR to fetch the coronet 20 years later), but it is a strong contender to be memorized as a film to remind us how the fashion alters in our fast food world (haircut, clothes, architecture, etc.), USA particularly.",Working Girl
22,ElMaruecan82,The gender-driven battle between horizontality and verticality...,8,7 August 2019,"As soon as the chorus triumphantly shouted ""Let the River Run"", I knew ""Working Girl"" aimed high. And high is the right word as the film opens with a zoom on the Statue of Liberty's face; the panoramic view on this Great Lady hints us about the film's subtext: when women show the light. Carmy Simon's song will win an Oscar and its uplifting tune is undeniable and integral to the success story.The titular ""Working Girl"" is Tess McGill who looks like your typical sexy girl who can only dream of being secretary or assistant to some big shot in a big company, but there's more in her, she's not a Harvard alumnus but she took classes and reads a lot. She works hard and is able to provide sound advice whose credibility is spoiled by her little-girl voice and eyes that seem to ask for permission to exist in a man's world. Speaking of men, they treat her like dirt, for lack of another word, feeling she's got more chances to work her way by sleeping with a sleazy coked-up manager played by Kevin Spacey. If she's hungry, she should accept.Let's get back to the film's opening now, the Statue of Liberty is a woman who stands and stands tall, defying the same verticality than the anonymous and numerous phallic skyscrapers and she's the most emblematic figure of New York. Following the metaphor, Tess is a woman who wants to move vertically, climbing up the professional ladder but through her merit. So when she's asked to sleep with ""Bob from Arbitrage"", it's again her perception of success. They call it horizontal promotion and she won't have it.Melanie Griffith has an effective way to play the innocent girl yearning for respect her vulnerability can't earn, she's not a cynical person but she's got her pride and is tired of being looked down as someone who must either sleep or stand wearing skimpy lingerie. Her boyfriend, played by Alec Baldwyn, offers her stockings for her birthday, which says a lot about his own vision of ladies. Dame Statue of Liberty doesn't show anything, and she's the one who's guiding people.This conflict between horizontality and verticality can even be expressed fashion-wise: men wear typical suits, women having those vertiginous 80s hairdos, Joan Cusack who plays Tess' friend Cyn couldn't have been any more New Yorker on that 'level', and when Tess gets back to the office, she trades her sneakers for high heels, anything that can artificially make women higher than men is welcome. But some women don't need any artifices, or do they?When her new boss, Katharine Parker comes into the picture, the woman exudes alpha confidence in every gesture, every detail of her notability, she's warm, amiable and authoritarian, always attentive in keeping things smooth and punchy. Parker is the woman Tess wants to become, she adopts her speech patterns, she cuts her hair and cut off the fancy jewelry, but the catch is that she becomes her servant and ironically, Parker become as condescending and insulting as a man would be, a fine touch in a script that could have been labeled as anti-male.So Tess doesn't turn out to be the lady who shows the light but the one who carries the torch, the casting of Weaver is crucial because she does a great job at hiding her feelings, she's much taller than Griffith and she wonderfully echoes the situation of women caught between two worlds. She's feminine and seductive with the guys, especially Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) but then harbors her status as a weapon to destroy the spirit of an ambitious woman. Her ambivalence allows us to appreciate the hypocrisy of some women who pretend to be pro-feminism, and yet are only product or accomplices to the system that only select a few to keep the majority under their feet.This is when the film gets a bit problematic and I won't get into the romantic undertones that could have been kept away from the script. Being a film from the 80s, directed by a man, Mike Nichols, and with Harrison Ford as the top-billed actor, we're allowed to wonder how sensitive to the pleas of women it is.First of all, I was pleased but also puzzled by the many scenes featuring Griffith in sexy underwear, it made sense where she sneaks into Katherine's wardrobe, but the moment where she vacuums her place might be a tad gratuitous, as if the male gaze found a tunnel through the director's camera, to betray the script. That said, there's a moment where Harrison Ford who plays the smooth office worker, have two long cocktail drinks and women are gazing at him with ""yummy"" looks, the size of the glasses leave no doubt over the symbols and overall, it was an interesting twist on the usual gender-roles tropes (no pun intended).The second problem was in the comeuppance Katherine would get, as deserved as it was, I was perplexed by the vulgar way she was treated. The 'bony' line wouldn't have been kept today, but maybe it was her way to 'perish' by the very weapons she used, when a woman gets at the top like a guy, why should her womanhood be an excuse to hinge on. I'm not sure about the way Parker was vilified at the end but maybe her contrast with Tess was crucial to comprehend that the best way to climb your way to success is to do so without compromising your femininity but more importantly, your integrity.Indeed, and that's why, more than a chick (or chic) flick, it's such a culturally significant film marking with ""Wall Street"" the end of the yuppie years, there's no dress code to be a successful man or woman, and keeping on the Statue of Liberty metaphor, what's the purpose of standing tall if you have no light to show?",Working Girl
23,Irishchatter,A brilliant movie with Ford and Griffith!,9,30 September 2016,"I really adore this movie and good Lord, so many people with big hair back then! Joan Cusack didn't look too bad with that hairstyle, she really looked so hip back then! Who knew she would be known as the voice of Jessy in Toy Story within the next decade?! Honestly I'm happy she was discovered and of course, part of my childhood. Anyways I love how Sigourney Weaver was just the bad sexy villain in this, she is just stunning like, why did Harrison have to deny her? Haha I liked how the story was set, especially the beginning where we can see a close up of the Statue of Liberty and the whole view of New York in the 80's. It's such a shame that the twin towers are not there anymore and the fact, it said some of the scenes took place in one of the towers offices. It's just amazing in movies on how you don't mind the background set, unless you read it somewhere to find out that there's a history behind it all!I loved the acting, the romance and the humour in this film.

24,inkblot11,"Still a classic in the ""you go girl"" category, a terrific film about working hard to get ahead",9,18 January 2008,"Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) lives in Brooklyn with her handsome boyfriend, Mick (Alec Baldwin). Although she comes from somewhat humble roots, she is trying hard to change her situation. While working in Manhattan, crossing the river in a long ferry ride each day, she went to night school and got a degree in economics, with honors. Yet, she is still a secretary to the big money makers on Wall Street, for no one will give her an entry into a more lucrative job in the world of big finance. When her scummy bosses set her up with a high rolling banker (Kevin Spacey), who wants sex in exchange for a promotion, Tess speaks out and gets herself fired. But, needing a new job, she is placed with a snooty, Wellesley-educated egomaniac, Katherine (Sigrouney Weaver), who promises help but promptly steals one of Tess's ideas, for her own benefit. Yet, when Katherine is bedridden from a skiing accident, Tess decides to pose as a colleague of Katherine's and teams up with hotshot financier, Jack (Harrison Ford) to pitch an investment proposal with lucrative possibilities for everyone. Things get complicated when Tess and Jack cast loving eyes at one another, for Jack is Katherine's former boyfriend. Woweeee, what will hit the fan when the furious, scorned Katherine finds out the score? This is a great ""you go girl"" movie that will never lose its relevancy. As Tess, Griffith gives a lovely, savvy performance that is very inspirational for women everywhere, for Tess retains her sweetness and optimism in the face of impossible odds. Ford is likewise attractive as the rough-around-the-edges investment banker and Weaver absolutely nails her role as the loathsome, self-centered Katherine. All of the lesser actors, Baldwin, Spacey, Oliver Platt, Olympia Dukakis, and Joan Cusack deliver fine performances, too. The Manhattan setting is beautiful, as are the costumes and the production values. Then, too, Carly Simon's title song is catchy and very appropriate and the script is clever and true. All in all, if you want to see a film where the underdog triumphs over the establishment, through hard work and intelligence, you could not do better than this classic Mike Nichols film. It can send anyone's spirits soaring into the sky.",Working Girl

Sure America still doesn't seem to have factory workers but at least we escape the successful and wealthy characters that Hollywood keeps feeding us. More accurately, we have this kind here with Sigourney but this time, this upper class is seen for what it's really: a bitchy one! The second originality is that the hero isn't male but a woman! And what's funny is that woman does what she want from our Indy! I'm not really a fan of miss Griffith but here she was OK and as it's a 80s movies where fashion was inspired, diverse and not assimilated with brands, it's very fresh. In addition, Joan Cusak is this perfect and eternal eccentric friend, identical to her « shameless » character 3 decades before. Harrison is his usual self in other words a soft- spoken buddy but full of kindness and rightness at close hands.

29,imseeg,Power to the rising young american working girl,7,4 July 2018,"Back in the eighties this might have been a promotion of female empowerment, but nowadays it is rather bizarre to see all the male chauvinistic work related attitudes pass by as being considered normal. Of course this is a hollywood movie in which stereotypes for comical and dramatic effect get exaggerated, but nowadays hollywood scripts wouldnt sell with this obnoxious male sexist attitude, although to great comical effect Sigourney Weaver is as bad as her male sexist collegues. Back in the eighties it still wasnt very common for women to wanna make a carreer. Not for the majority at least, but this movie tells the succesful story of a normal working girl who made it big time.
""Working Girl"" is a lovely romanticized picture of an ordinary working girl who started as an ordinary secretary and succeeds in climbing the ladder of corporate america. Lovely role by the ever so charming Melanie Griffith in one of her best roles in her entire carreer. Melanie's charm is to die for. Recently I saw an old Johnny Carson interview with Melanie Griffith, just before ""Working Girl"" was about to be released. This Carson interview shows us viewers a woman who is truly one heavenly, honest and kind woman in real life, who was to become very famous. I wouldnt mention this if she hadnt played an identical character in this movie also. Art imitating life. Great roles by Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver too, who both play leading parts. But Melanie steals the show!""Working Girl"" from the eighties feels a bit dated, looking back now (hilarious hairstyles), but for young women wanting to make a carreer, this movie could really be a wonderful inspiration, although for the male viewers the romantic cliches can feel a bit too sugarcoated...At an trivia endnote I wanna praise the great soundtrack by Carly Simon, who also performed in the soundtrack for another movie about female empowerment called ""Postcards from the Edge"" also made by the same direcor Mike Nichols. This director has got a brilliant talent for telling true to life feel good stories. ""Working Girl"" is laden with hollywood cliches, but it is made with so much feel good charm it pleases me every time I see it. Men should think twice before watching it, unless they wanna watch it together with their girlfriend, because as I said before, the only real flaw is that the story is very sugarcoated...",Working Girl

Griffith has some good business ideas and shares one with her boss who secretively claims it as her own. Griffith finds out and exacts an intelligent revenge and along the way dabbles in a little romance with Ford's character who has some connection to the business idea. The story is straight forward and well-acted and is moderately believable pending your perspective. The cinematography is TV quality and 1988 has the worst styles as the 80's were quickly fading out and the 90's hadn't quite taken hold yet. Just awful.

34,jimbo-53-186511,Unconvincing & boring,1,18 February 2015,"Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) starts a new job with Petty Marsh who are a mergers & acquisitions company. Her boss Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) breaks her leg in a skiing accident and asks Tess to take care of things in her absence. However, when Tess discovers that Katharine is passing off one of Tess's 'acquisition' ideas as her own, she assumes Katharine's position whilst she's laid up in hospital and with the help of Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) Tess is intent on sealing the deal without Katharine.Aside from being boring, the screenplay for this film is so badly written & unconvincing that it's just laughable. Let's take a look at a few examples;1) Katharine tells Tess that she can be in charge of the company whilst she's laid up in hospital (even though she's only been in the job 5 minutes). Is this really believable?2) Katharine allows Tess to access her apartment to sort out her dry cleaning etc even though she's left audio evidence of her deceit and has also left evidence of her deceit on her home computer. Why would she allow Tess access to her apartment knowing that this evidence is there in her apartment and knowing that Tess could access it? It's just stupid beyond belief.3) Tess and Jack end up hooking up together even though their initial encounter is based on deceit, deceit and more deceit. Yeah right!! It just got worse and worse as it went along.Aside from the scripting problems, the film was just downright boring. The story wasn't particularly interesting - in fact it got so bad that I was considering stopping watching this film at about the 1 hour mark. I decided to persevere hoping that it would improve, but it never did. Griffith & Ford just shared no chemistry, their romance was ridiculous and all of the characters were nasty and unlikeable.The only very slight positive is that it's a 'feel good' film in the sense of getting one over on one's boss and it's certainly noteworthy.

Weaver turns in a good, believable performance as the boss lady, and Harrison isn't bad? I wouldn't say that his performance is quite to the level of the others, but that certainly doesn't mean he is lackluster. Oh and I almost forgot about Alec Baldwin, he is a supporting character here too, one of his earliest roles. The writing is pretty good, it's comical the majority of the film, with occasional scenes that are serious. The film is very 80s, hopefully you know what I mean when I say that. Complete with many 80s pop culture references, the style of the clothes (especially Joan Cusack), and music filled sequences, meaning the nude vacuuming.

Any film that is a drama/social commentary should be something helpful for the audience, or if it is a romantic comedy, should have novel actors, or at least can give us a laugh which is unexpected.I can remember when this film came out, and a colleague asked me if I had seen it, saying it accurately depicts women in the workplace. (Yawn) More generalizations.Melanie Griffith was (at that time) too much the stereotypical dumb blonde, Harrison Ford, the eligible CEO (as always), Sigourney Weaver the educated taskmaster boss.

40,Steffi_P,"""She's your man""",8,29 November 2011,"Although the 60s and 70s are thought of as the age of feminism, it wasn't really until the 80s that women really achieved a bit of equality in movie land. But this being a less radical time, the dramas about powerful women tended to be a synthesis of Women's Lib and Reagan era entrepreneurial optimism. This is after all what success meant in that decade. But of-its-time as it is, Working Girl is still an entertaining and uplifting picture.Written by Kevin Wade, Working Girl is a nice, neatly-constructed story. On a broad level it could be seen a black-and-white tale of good guys and bad guys. But what saves the characters from appearing one-dimensional is that they are written with a great deal of knowing realism. Who hasn't worked for a boss like Sigourney Weaver's character, or been cheated on by a jerk like Alec Baldwin's? One thing that keeps Working Girl engaging is that, while not an out-and-out comedy it is often tentatively funny in the way that real life is funny, such as Alec Baldwin's futile claim that ""This isn't what it looks like"".The effectiveness of Working Girl often hinges on the way its characters are projected. On paper, Tess McGill isn't necessarily sympathetic, and neither is Katherine Parker necessarily unpleasant, at least not in the first half of the movie. However, Melanie Griffith portrays the lead with enough drive to appear credible as a go-getter, but all wrapped in a kind of sensitive charm that makes her likable. It's lucky she didn't inherit her mother's steeliness. And Sigourney Weaver manages to convey a smug and patronising manner that is only hinted at in the script, but never quite overdoing it so it is still believable that Griffith initially warms to her. Harrison Ford is at his best too, moulding the role round his limited range by giving a business-world version of his usual level-headed action hero type.If you're a fan of the look of this era, Working Girl will be a real treat for the eyes – everything from glorious cityscapes to pouffy dresses. I'm glad director Mike Nichols puts such an emphasis on places and props, without loosing sight of the people of course. The changing fashions of the decade are even woven into the movie's themes, as Griffith swaps her hairsprayed bouffant and dangly bangles for an elegant, simple look. Working Girl is an incredibly 80s movie, but it's also the death of 80s extravagance we're witnessing there on screen. Of course, she still wears a pair of pink glasses with rims the size of beermats, but there you go. 80s extravagance died hard.",Working Girl

Uneven but breezy comedy could have been a probing, satirically funny examination of corporate culture and all the sexism and backstabbing within, but ends up following the mechanism of contrived, farcical masquerade; it's also pretty low-energy, exemplified by Ford and his hangdog deadpan, who often just seems tired, even when he aspires for buoyant enthusiasm. Worse off is Griffith, whose breathy voice and shaky cadence results in a disoriented performance as off-putting as the big 80s hair she wears in her early scenes; at least Weaver provides spark as the blithely duplicitous boss, a portrayal far more authentic than most other memorable corporate sharks in film. Cusack, Platt and Spacey (in a bit part as a loutish cokehead) manage to score some laughs on the sidelines.47/100",Working Girl
43,DeeNine-2,Who's afraid of Sigourney Weaver?,6,28 April 2003,"Working girl Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith, sporting some serious hair) is continuously being mistaken for a ""coffee, tea or me?"" kind of person when in fact she works hard, reads widely and studies nights to get ahead in the business world. But the sexist, class-conscious business world just won't take her seriously. Finally she hooks up with Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver), a successful but vulturous deal-maker with an elevated opinion of herself who knows how to use people. They set up a mentor relationship with Tess getting the coffee and Katherine spouting the words of wisdom. When Tess comes up with a good business idea, Katherine steals it.Enter soon after Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) and we have our triangle. Katherine has broken her leg skiing and Tess has to fill in for her. When Tess discovers that Katherine has ripped off her idea, she decides to assume Katherine's accouterments, including her lavish apartment, her wardrobe, her hairstyle, and as it turns out, her boyfriend. Will she succeed, and will she find true love and happiness with the leading man? Inquiring minds want to know.Director Mike Nichols, auteur of a number of film land successes of more than average sophistication, including Postcards from the Edge (1990), The Graduate (1967), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), etc. with help from screen writer Kevin Wade and Melanie herself, manages to create enough sympathy for Tess that we want her to win. Sigourney Weaver does such a fine job of being a kind of sociopathic villainess that we want her to lose.Guess what happens?While this is not on the same level as the three Mike Nichols flicks mentioned above, either in terms of cinematic significance or craftsmanship, it is clever and witty at times, and the story is one that most American women will find easy to identify with. And of course the winner gets Harrison Ford, displaying his usual bodice-busting charm. Only problem (aside from some smarmy pandering to a chick flick audience) is that the chemistry between Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford is lacking.See this for Mike Nichols whose direction here can be described as just a working guy trying to make a buck and not doing a bad job of it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

44,lambiepie-2,A Timeless Corporate Tale,8,10 September 2006,"Melanie Griffith has had a career with sincere hits and disappointing losers. This is one of the winners. This is a wonderful timeless tale regarding the 'corporate' working world. Is it out dated? Not by a landslide. Those who might think so, better get a copy of this and study it well.Griffith plays Tess - a 'secretary' in the mergers and acquisitions department in a big corporation (now known in the 2000's as either as an assistant, administrative, Office Manager or Manager) who comes from a lower end of New York where everyone has an accent and is lower blue collar section, get married, pump out kids and die there. But Tess wants better, she's worked her way to her BA through night school. She wants nothing more than entry into the corporations executive program so she can progress up the corporate ladder to better positions in the company. In her quest for this, she's had male bosses who see her only as the company 'fun-bag' due to her position as a 'secretary', her tight fitting clothes, lower income accent and big hair, telling her that Harvard graduates keep beating her out for the placement. In their eyes, 'secretaries' like her are an easy lay...because most of the 'secretaries' in the company are. How can Tess be any different?Tess's world is even worse, her boyfriend is a two timing sleaze as well. She asks for a department transfer (fourth time in six months) and hopes her luck is about to change. A new department head comes into mergers and acquisition and its a female boss, Catherine, played by Signorney Weaver. Signorney, is perfect as plays the superiority card until she gets into a vacation ski accident, asks Tess to answer her letters and Tess finds out that one of her best ideas was stolen by her female boss. Tess strikes back, taking her idea over by pretending to be a department head. She does well until her boss, Catherine, comes back and 'the lie is exposed' which leads to one of the best 'taking credit for your own work' turns in films.Why this is timeless is because the Tess and Catherine story is played out in major corporations daily. Many folks may not see it because small businesses have taken over, as the major employer against large sized corporations and the traditional corporate structure, clothes styles have changed and the media keeps putting out messages that women have made their way up the corporate ladder. In small business, employees have to wear so many hats as well as the entrepreneur hat itself so it is hard to tell 'the secretary' from 'the owner' and everyone is striving just to keep the doors open.Make no mistake, this is STILL happening in large corporations. Many employers put too much stock into a named university degreed person with a snooty background, a closet full of labels and limited on the job experience --- rather than a hard working, build themselves up the ladder, college second or third tier degree holder that lives in a one room apartment with roaches as roommates, and not enough money to buy the ""hip clothes of the day"" - and that is what this story is about.The 'starting from the bottom up' hard working degreed person is usually the most qualified as in Tess's case, but the corporation will hire a Harvard educated, pretentious Manhattanite who does as minimal work as possible because, heck, they have the hard working degreed assistant to make them look good.There are several films in many industries that do not escape this basic tale. The big difference here is that these are two women. One woman thought by leaving the men and working with a woman, she'd get better. She didn't. And there's a lesson too - the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Work is work, and everyone can be a shark for self-preservation. Companies that are: men to women, women to women, men to men, blacks to whites, black to black, white to white, etc, it does not matter. Tess learned, took matters into her own hands and turned out with a positive. Message: Your BA/MBA degree is as important as anyone else's, but you've gotta compete. It's all about YOU.That's why this film works and the message is timeless.",Working Girl
45,tbills2,A Hard Working Girl Making Her Way to the Top of the Corporate World in the Heart of the Big City,7,25 February 2019,"Melanie Griffith stars in her top leading lady role as well as her best movie to date, Working Girl! She mesmerizes radiating strikingly natural and pure beauty plus her flailing, wavy long blonde hair is just to die for really then when she cuts it off...oh my gosh I'm in love. Working Girl is ALL of the Melanie Griffith anyone will ever need in their putrid, miserable lives. Watching Griffith in Working Girl now, Melanie satisfies and fulfills and grants my every wish and fantasy and desire appearing in fully body frames on the camera showing off multiple panty sets, wearing a bunch of differently styled unique dresses, plenty of coats, plenty of earrings, vests, sweaters, sweater vests, belts, lots of skirts, eye shadow, lots of lipstick and blush, stockings, some fashionable purses, necklaces with charms, gold bracelets, rings, a turtleneck, jackets, lots of button-up blouses, nail polish, jeans and leather, socks, boots, shoes and heels, of course, a watch, business suits, glasses and even one scene in particular where Melanie has nothing on at all underneath a sheet as Tess. Griffith's one Hollywood's all-time legendary superstars gaining that profile sheerly by this role alone as well as with Something's Wild to a smaller degree and to a lesser scale. I love Melanie Griffith! Melanie as Tess McGill plays one of the most truly iconic and exceptional women in the workforce cinematic characters who rises from rags to riches in this up and comer and notorious big city tale. Melanie is seriously so hot I love her her soul shines bright like the beautiful woman she is and I love her daughter even more! Sigourney Weaver stars alongside Griffith as Catherine Parker. It's nice to see Sigourney act with a beautiful woman like Melanie for once since I know that it seems like Sigourney's always acting in her roles surrounded by just males in her films like her in the Ghostbusters and her in the Aliens and Galaxy Quest too, so you can really get a good look at just how pretty Sigourney really is. I love it. I love Sigourney! Harrison Ford is charming, handsome and sweet and cool. I like Melanie! Joan Cusack, Alec Baldwin, Oliver Platt, Olympia Dukakis, Kevin Spacey, Nora Dunn, David Duchovny among some other recognizable faces are some of the people that you might see in this erotic, fresh, and very capturing Mike Nichols' light-hearted drama from the '88 year of the '80s decade starring Melanie Griffith, Working Girl, a one-of-a-kind mix of business with pleasure! I love this movie and I own it on Blu-ray! Melanie makes me so happy. I love Melanie Griffith. She's sensational.",Working Girl

It tells the story of manipulation by a supposed mentor. It shows what guts and brains it takes to put together a merger when you are a lowly secretary. Melanie Griffith pulls it off, and we laugh and applaud her success. Marvelous acting, directing, writing, and cinematography. Carly Simon won an oscar for the music.",Working Girl
47,Isaac5855,A Thinking Man's Comedy and the Surprise Smash Hit of 1988,8,3 April 2007,"WORKING GIRL was a first-rate motion picture comedy which displayed flashes of brilliance and was the breakaway surprise hit film of 1988. Masterfully directed by Mike Nichols, the film tells the story of Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) a secretary who wants to be more than a secretary, who has a business idea stolen from her by her current boss and then gets her revenge by pretending to be her boss who is temporarily sidelined. Nichols has a razor sharp screenplay here and has assembled a first-rate cast to pull it off. Griffith is a revelation as Tess, a role that re-ignited her comatose career and garnered her a Best Actress nomination. Sigourney Weaver is perfection as Catherine Parker, Tess' bitchy, self-absorbed boss who smiles in Tess' face but proves she's someone you can't turn your back on. Harrison Ford, in a refreshing change of pace for him, proves to be surprisingly adept at light comedy as Jack Trainer, Catherine's tentative love interest and business associate who finds himself torn when he meets Tess in the midst of her charade. The interplay between these three rich and complex characters makes for one of the most interesting triangles to hit the big screen in years. There are effective supporting bits contributed along the away by Joan Cusack, Oliver Platt, Olympia Dukakis, Alec Baldwin, Philip Bosco, and in blink-and you-miss-them-cameos, Ricki Lake and Kevin Spacey. One of the smartest and most engaging comedies ever made that also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (Weaver and Cusack)and won Carly Simon the Oscar for Best Original Song. A triumph for Nichols and a flawless comic ensemble. Not only one of the best of 1988, but one of the best comedies of the 1980's period.",Working Girl

49,bheadher,One of the best entertaining stories ever...,10,24 December 2017,"Sort of an update...November 18, 2020I still feel sad that this movie was missed by so many over the years...Working girl brings the struggle we all face to life, but without hitting you over the head with the morality involved.I'm actually surprised that Working Girl didn't have far more reviews than it got here. It's an all around story, that touches on a variety of subjects, and makes them funny, sad, uplifting, and heart warming, all at the same time...Without going into too many details, Working Girl also demonstrates a bit of the topic of high level Corporate wheeling and dealing...weaving that into a delightful couple hours of popcorn munching fun...",Working Girl
50,DavidSim240183,Wall Street in heels,10,6 August 2007,"Working Girl is a real treat. As long as you can get past the dated hairstyles and garish fashions you will find a really entertaining film about big business. The type of film Wall Street wanted to be but wasn't. Where that film had Michael Douglas playing an absurd caricature for a villain, Working Girl not only has a more realistic villain, but a sympathetic figure at the centre that you really want to see get ahead.Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) is a put-upon secretary with business sense, but she's surrounded by (male) colleagues that don't take her seriously. Working for men gets Tess nowhere, so she tries her luck with a woman instead. Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) is the department head of a Wall Street mergers & acquisitions firm. And she assures Tess its a ""two-way street"" on her team. Katharine can help Tess climb the ladder of success.Tess may be 30 years old, but with her airy voice, clanking bracelets and scary looking hair, she often gives the impression of being a little girl trying to play in an adult's world. Also it doesn't occur to her that Katharine may not be looking out for Tess's best interests.When Tess brings a lucrative idea to Katharine, she's crushed when she discovers that Katharine has no intention of letting a lowly secretary profit from it. She steals the idea, but before she can act upon it she breaks her leg in a skiing accident. Tess takes her absence as an opportunity to get ahead by claiming she is the head of her department, and tries to get her idea up and ready to fly.Working Girl works because its not just aimed squarely at the level of a comedy. There are plenty of laughs to be had. But there is a serious, dramatic thrust that helps the film get its points across. Because its quite a dangerous charade Tess is playing. And you know, that at any moment she could get caught. The fact you don't want that to happen is proof the film is working.Tess McGill is arguably the best character Melanie Griffith has ever played. She's never been this good in any other film. Her acting is perfectly paced and beautifully delivered. She goes from a naive, pathetic trusting fool (her words) to a committed, astute and assured businesswoman with total conviction. Her change in hairstyles is striking too. But convincing!There's a fine ensemble cast too. Sigourney Weaver gives one of her finest performances to date. Her role as the bitchy, power-hungry Katharine is really quite wonderful, even though she spends half the film laid up with broken bones (her words). She can act all angelic and turn cold-hearted and cruel at the drop of a hat. She gets the lions share of all the best lines too:""We're in the same city now. I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer. I've cleared the month of June...and I am, after all, me.""Sigourney Weaver is always interesting when she plays the part of a bitch, because she never has to try hard to convince us. Her monotone voice is dripping with arch, disguised intentions, and you just know she's got something perfectly despicable bubbling away in her head. I wish Weaver would play the part of the villain(ess) more often.Harrison Ford plays Jack Trainer, the man Tess approaches to put her business deal together. It becomes something more when they fall in love, and something more personal when it turns out Jack is involved with Katharine. He just hasn't broken it off yet. Ford is OK in the role. He brings his usual, likable presence to the proceedings. And the scene where he tells Tess the (true) story of how he got a scar is sweet. But Working Girl belongs to the women.Another standout is the absolutely superb Joan Cusack as Tess's best friend Cyn. No matter what film she's in, she always turns in stellar support. And she can often steal scenes right out from under the main players. I'm especially partial to the scene when she's watching a descending chandelier in Katharine's home: ""Why is it doing that?""Director Mike Nichols' direction is breezy, keeping the comedy, romance and drama all perfectly balanced. He never puts a foot wrong, and gives Kevin Wade's witty screenplay plenty of room to breathe.As things come to a head, we know inevitably that things will turn out well for Tess. But not before some solid suspense and an initially disheartening finale. But things turn around. Katharine's comeuppance is wonderful. Tess gets her job. And her man. As well as a happy ending. And she truly deserves it too.The closing shot, accompanied to Carly Simon's wonderfully uplifting ""Let The River Run"" is the perfect cap on events, and leaves you beaming all the way through to the end credits. Great little speech from Tess at the end too. A quite poetic account of a girl's place in a man's world. Working Girl looks like a cross between Nine to Five and Wall Street, but its better than both of them put together.",Working Girl
51,Idocamstuf,"Fun, but not worthy of an acedemy award",6,11 December 2002,"Working Girl is the kind of movie you can sit back and relax to. The acting is not superb, It's not a laugh out loud comedy, and the plot is rather silly. Melanie Griffith was never a top-notch actress, and this film is no exeption. Harrison Ford is wasted , as he is in other comedies(The Frisco Kid, Sabrina), and he had another much better movie out that year, which was ""Frantic"", which deserved to be more sucessful than ""Working Girl"". I dont want to make it sound like I hated this movie, because I didnt. But I did find it rather juevinille at times, and often poorly acted. Overall an average movie. **1/2 out of *****",Working Girl
52,roghache,"Wonderful, fun, feel good comeuppance tale",8,2 April 2006,"This is a fabulous movie. Maybe not rocket science, but clever enough! It has an engaging plot, an extremely empathetic heroine, a villainous boss, a cheatin' boyfriend, and a handsome new love interest just stepping into the picture. Get your popcorn ready for the comeuppance story of a lifetime.The tale revolves around a smart secretary named Tess McGill, who wants to get ahead in the Big Apple but is beaten down by her nasty boss, Katherine, who steals her ideas and passes them off as her own. Fortune smiles on Tess when Katherine breaks her leg during a skiing holiday and Tess is able to 'take charge'...that is, until her boss, who recovers all too quickly, returns. Of course there is also a romance brewing here in the form of a handsome investment banker named Jack Trainer, who just happens to be her boss's boyfriend.Harrison Ford is his typical dashing, magnetic self in the role of Jack Trainer, but it is the two ladies that make this movie. Signourey Weaver is absolutely villainous as an employee's 'worst nightmare' boss, a lady (no, not a lady) high up the corporate ladder, but lacking any semblance of integrity or kindness toward anyone below her in that ladder. You will be itching to see this nasty snob get her comeuppance.Above all, Melanie Griffith is brilliant in the role of Tess, every viewer's favorite downtrodden secretary. She's a woman with all the intelligence and skills needed to succeed in the corporate world, but is ill used by those above her who put her down. Many employees out there will identify with Tess, having at some point in their lives been ill treated by a boss, whether male or female, with at least shades of Katherine. Furthermore, Tess will surely gain viewer sympathy regarding her unfortunate experiences with her sleazy live in lover, Mick.The scene featuring the Staten Island ferry is beautifully done, accompanied as it is by Carly Simon's wonderful Oscar winning song, 'Let the River Run'. What an amazing voice! This is really a fantastic, fun movie. You can't help but love it.",Working Girl
53,rowmorg,"Highly entertaining study of ""the glass ceiling"".",8,13 September 2013,"Mike Nichols got a brilliant performance out of his leading lady Melanie Griffiths (pre-face-lift version). She must die looking at this picture now: her bum was enormous, her breasts were too small (just like most actresses'), her face and neck were all puffy and OMG! that appalling hair-do at the start: it really stank and could have put you off the picture for all time. However, it gets really good as Nichols lets a strong script speak and teases good performances out of his players. It's all about the ""glass ceiling"" that prevents secretaries ever breaking out of their shitty jobs and getting into the executive ranks, and it savours an extra element in showing a female executive (guess what?) stealing a great idea from her secretary. It gives a horribly clear glimpse of the sectionalised American society (workers, executives, super-rich) that makes a mockery of the Statue of Liberty past which the working girls sail in the ferry in the opening scene. All-in-all, a strong satirical film that has stood the test of time, even with its idiotic haircuts.",Working Girl

It's totally dated already, with it's wild hair and clothing, but it feels like a capsule into that era and that's half of the fun of it. It's so delightfully '80s in the best of ways, which is probably my favorite decade for comedies. The premise is a standard one, but what makes it special comes in way of it's characters.Melanie Griffith is so endearing and easy to like, it makes it practically impossible not to root for her and the ending left a huge smile on my face. Sigourney Weaver steals all of her scenes, although I do wish they had let her be a little more sinister. Still, it was played a lot more naturally the way that they did it. Harrison Ford practically steals the movie for me, in a role unlike anything I've seen him do, goofy and charming and at times a bit of a nerd. It's also got one of Kevin Spacey's first roles and he's only in one scene but had me aching with laughter.Everyone in the cast has delightful chemistry together and they all make for an enjoyable, comfortable viewing that kept a smile on my face the whole way through.

I love the way her rival Katherine Parker ( Sigourney Weaver) is written. She is a walking F Word as in FAKE, and being told by Owen Trask ( Phillip Bosco) to get ""Your bony ass out of might sight"" is a classic scene. Spoilers ahead: You know that in the end Tess is going to defeat Katherine ( Katherine stole an idea of Tess's an presented as her own), but how she does it is why you watch. What I like also about Tess is she never forget where she came from, and did not look down on people when she became successful. Watch the scene with her secretary Alice Baxter. She told her ""You can call me Tess, you do not have to get me coffee, unless you are getting some for yourself and the rest ( rules) we will make up as we go along.""

The motif is class warfare, muddled with an isosceles love triangle.Griffith has to be the most physically unappealing actress to be given the star treatment.

Working Girl did more than pave success for Melanie's career, but provided great acting from Harrison Ford as always, and featured Alec Baldwin and Joan Cusack in perhaps their earliest roles. Note: Kevin Spacey fans Kevin has a very brief and short scene in a limo with Melanie, but if you like Kevin the scene doesn't disappoint. Sigourney Weaver was very hateable as Melanie's boss. C. Simon's song ""Let The River Run"" played throughout the movie helps carry the film along. This film is a tribute to anyone who is in a blue-collar underdog background struggling to achieve success.

This is a true product of its time and as such is superior to most of today's films.From the beginning, you sympathize with Tess McGill because the character is well written and not irritating, and the story is well balanced, with different characters, good and bad and those in between.Sigourney Weaver is excellent in the role of the villain, and Melanie Griffith is great as Tess McGill, a secretary who wants to succeed in the business world.In this film, not all women are saints, but women of flesh and blood, with their flaws and with whom you can sympathize, and men are the same, different, some are bad some are good, just like in real life.An interesting and fun story with a good cast.",Working Girl

Having just seen 'Up In The Air' it amazes me how Hollywood ignores the world of organisations and work - I don't count the numbing slacker genre of Rogen, Stiller et al or the glossy magazine sagas of the last couple of years - when it is looking for freshness and humour. 'Working Girl' smolders and pokes fun at pretentiousness and self-importance - and the noughties seem to have repeated the glossy over the top eighties in finance terms! The acting from its three leads is excellent, the Cinderella plot works as well as any other aspirational movie (certainly better than 'Rocky' et al), and the writing has just the right amount of truthfulness to carry it off. Nichol's direction is measured and not overbearing, pulling the big visual compositions into the foreground only sparingly.

Sigourney Weaver is excellent as the cold, calculating Katherine Parker and Harrison Ford is great as a romantic lead. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer of this film may be Joan Cusack as Tess McGill's big haired best friend, Cyn.The only two things that detract from the movie are Katherine claiming to be 30 when Sigourney Weaver looked nearly a decade older, and the idea that Katherine and Tess could possibly wear the same size clothing. Other than that, this is a highly recommended flick!",Working Girl

67,Travis_Bickle01,Very pleasant surprise!,8,5 July 2005,"Romantic comedy-drama by the very talented Mike Nichols (he has recently made ""Closer"" and ""Angels In America"") with an excellent cast (Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin and a very small part for Kevin Spacey). Not only was I surprised by the movie as a whole, I loved Melanie Griffith's performance a lot. I'm not really a huge fan of her because she's seldom casted in the movies I watch, but she was wonderful in this ""Working Girl"". Overall the acting was great in this movie. Joan Cusack was nice as well as Sigourney Weaver. The story was excellent and the haircuts really looked funny.The story is about a girl who doesn't have an academic degree, but who wants to get higher on the corporate ladder by making sacrifices and working hard. She is very ambitious and she wants to make it. I think this movie certainly is underrated. It should at least have a 7. I personally gave it an 8. It's highly enjoyable and Mike Nichols has proved he really can make everything. This movie works! 8/10",Working Girl
68,n-mo,A nice little accurate ride,8,1 July 2013,"I was pretty shocked to learn, after watching this film, that Mike Nichols was the director: a lighthearted, linearly-plotted chick comedy from the man behind the absurdist Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and the character-driven The Graduate, both very heavy drama indeed, is not at all what one might expect.However, the same quality craftsmanship from the aforementioned two permeates the entirety of this deceivingly simple movie. Though Tess McGill's achievements may seem a bit far-fetched, the story works because its depiction of the New York business and finance world in which she navigates is extremely accurate. The highly sensitive maneuvering in the cutting details is played to a T. We are also treated to the insecure porcine antics of nerdy male big-name school alumni desperate to cover up for their lack of real virility or machismo, as well-as the self-conscious vacuousness of many of their female counterparts, so beautifully incarnated in Tess's boss, Katherine Parker.Tess's plight, as well, as a frustrated woman but especially as an aging (she's 30) Bright Young Thing frustrated in her attempts to get that seal of validation for her competence and style, ring very true. It doesn't matter whether you're a man or a woman: anyone who has had to work with/for Ivy League alumni without having an Ivy League degree himself, or report to someone younger or barely older than himself, as I have, will begin rooting for Tess quite swiftly.Harrison Ford's acting doesn't particularly stand out, but it wasn't bad. It helped that Ford was given a role with some degree of substance, though Melanie Griffith clearly outshines him. The omnipresence of Katherine's energy threatening to darken Tess's work, even when Katherine is absent, is quite remarkable, and it's almost frightening how well Sigourney Weaver, herself a Yale alumna, seemed to understand the territory in which she had to play Katherine.All-in-all, brilliant work. Two thumbs up!",Working Girl
69,native_girl333,Come as you are,8,23 June 2006,"So what if the hair-do's look awful in 80's? Tess McGill's story is sincere and heart-warming.Tess wants to be heard. Her only problem is that she hasn't got the ""right"" education. Every male sees her as an sex object like delightfully sleazy Kevin Spacey who makes a couple of minutes long entry on screen. After Tess gets an assistant job working under a woman (Sigourney Weaver) she has an opportunity to influence.Katharine Parker (Weaver) gets into a skiing accident, and Tess finds out that her boss has stolen her idea she has an opportunity to get even. She pretends to be Katharine.Tess meets an investment broker Jack Trainer (everytime as charming Harrison Ford) and hooks up with him to make a deal with the company she wants.The music of Carly Simon is lively and suiting.

It is so extreme that you might think that this was a caricature movie made recently ABOUT the 80s - no-- this was made in 1988 and women really did look like this!Beyond that it is a fairly decent and well made movie - the main strength being Weaver's acting and the aforementioned camp attraction. I am not sure what Antonio Bandares was thinking though.",Working Girl
72,MartynGryphon,Indiana Jones & The Raiders Of The Lost Briefcase,10,6 April 2008,"OK, maybe not, but it does make the mind boggle doesn't it? Serious review time.As a decade, the 1980's had a LOT to answer for. It was a decade where, if you were a woman, you had to have more hair than an entire herd of Afghan hounds, and if people could still see your ears, then your shoulder pads were obviously not big enough. It was also a decade where we were taught that greed was good and to hell with your neighbour. In short, it was the decade of YUPPYISM.The Hollywood of the late 1980's rightly saw yuppyism as a cash cow that was worth milking at LEAST a couple of times a year. in 1987 we had the very successful but quite boring drama 'Wall Street' and also the not so successful yet quite entertaining comedy 'The Secret Of My Success'. In 1988 we saw Bette Midler & Lily Tomlin tackle their 'Big Business' and later that year it was Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver & Melanie Griffith's turn in the wonderful corporate comedy 'Working Girl'.Desperate for success in the world of high finance, Tess McGill (Griffith) is seen by her boss as nothing more than an assistant with a voice that could grate cheese. However, she's a girl that has her wits about her, a girl who can predict the market changes better than any of her superiors and a girl who has a unique ability to spot the next big business opportunities simply by browsing periodical magazines and newspapers. However, without contacts, social standing or proper elocution, she cannot get herself heard by the powers that be.After an altercation with her sexist boss, (played by a young Oliver Platt), she's transferred to a the Merger's & Acquisitions department as an assistant to high flyer Katherine Parker (Weaver), Parker is egotistical, patronising, and thoroughly unpleasant, but disguises it well under a sickly sweet friendly easy going demeanour. It's a front that fools Tess straight away but it's a front the audience sees through, (or should see through), from her very first scene. Parker on the other hand, immediately notices Tess's ability to 'think outside the box'. and intends to use her ideas as a platform for her own progression rather than Tess's.Encouraged to bring her ideas to Katherine, Tess approaches her with a suggestion that TRASK industries, a company who are looking to expand their enterprise into broadcasting , should buy a radio network instead of going straight to television as there are more for sale and they can avoid any bidding wars with other companies looking to buy TV Networks and once there, they can use the radio network as a springboard into TV. Katherine offers to see if the idea could take flight, but disappoints Tess a few days later by telling her that TRASK is only looking at television as an option.After Katherine breaks her leg whilst away skiing in the alps, she calls Tess and instructs her to 'mind the store' in her absence. Tess is sent to Katherine's apartment to collect mail and so forth and it is while there that she finds that her TRASK idea wasn't the dead duck Katherine had informed her it was and that she had already arranged to approach business ace Jack Trainer, (Ford), to arrange the meetings with TRASK but worse still, was going to pass it off as her own brainstorm.Betrayed and slightly deflated by the revelation, Tess decides to 'pull off the gloves' and is determined to give Katherine both barrels by having the deal done and dusted before Katherine returns from overseas. Tess & Trainer are attracted to each other straight away, and the deal starts to take shape, though it soon becomes apparent to Trainer that Tess has some very unorthodox business practices, such as gate-crashing the wedding of the daughter of Oren Trask (Philip Bosco), in order to get the man interested in the concept.Romance starts to blossom but both are trapped in sour relationships. Tess with love rat Mick (Alec Baldwin), and Trainer with none other than Katherine Parker, setting up one of rom-com's favourite clichés, the love triangle.On her return to New York, Katherine finds Tess's diary in her apartment and notices that the deal is to complete that day, realising that Tess has had the jump on her, immediately makes preparations to scotch the works.Will our two heroes complete their deal and find happiness with each other?, or will the baddie win through. If you're left wondering about the answer, then you've obviously NEVER seen a Romantic Comedy before.I can't end my review without special notice to Joan Cusack in a star making performance as Tess's friend and confidant Cyn. She steals every scene that she's in, but then again she does that in every movie doesn't she? Great film, great cast and great direction probably makes 'Working Girl' The very best of the corporate comedy Genre.Enjoy!!!",Working Girl

She wants more out of life but is not taken seriously. I worked in downtown Manhattan during this time period & the film captures the essence of that time & place wonderfully. From the big hair, to the sneakers on female commuters with office clothing, it all rings true. I especially love the scenes of Tess on the ferry. This was Melanie's Griffith's best film & performance. Her character Tess is struggling & you can't help but root for her! Sigourney Weaver is great as the underhanded boss (Katherine) who steals one of Tess' ideas & tries to run with it. Harrison Ford, as the man both women want (Jack), is endearing in a lost, goofy kind of way. Alec Baldwin as Tess' cheating boyfriend (Mick) was at his most attractive (he's a bloated mess now). You'll also enjoy Joan Cusack as Cyn, Tess' best friend. Look for cameos by Olympia Dukakis & Ricki Lake. The theme song ""Let The River Run"" by Carly Simon captures the film's theme in a nutshell. (The whole soundtrack album is excellent). When watched now, the scenes of Tess on her way to work at The World Trade Center are bittersweet & poignant.",Working Girl
75,AbeStreet,"Not just a ""chick flick.""",8,28 October 2005,"This film has no action scenes, involves a romance, and tells the story of a working class female and her struggle to better her personal and professional life. On the surface the film may seem as though it is targeted towards a female audience, not so! Basically this film is about an underdog and the underdog's desire to better herself. This is something both males and females can relate to. The underdog, Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), is not pure of heart. McGill manipulates, lies and deceives people to get what she wants. I think all people, to some extent, have done these very same things at some point in their lives. What is somewhat unique about this film is that the underdog has to come face to face with her moral wrong doings. Once she does this she is able to face the reality of her situation and for better or worse move on. Does she persevere and come out on top? I won't tell, watch the movie.I think Mike Nichols did a fine job of taking a somewhat common story (an underdogs struggle to advance/win), a cast of recognizable but (at the time of the release) non ""A"" list actors, and a nice but unspectacular song & score and produced a hit movie worthy of all the ""Oscar"" nominations it received, including a win for Best Song. In other words the sum of the parts was greater than a single part. Some movies boast big names or a great song but the film fails to have the emotional impact or appeal that WG does. Speaking only for myself, I heard ""Let the River Run"" by Carly Simon before I saw WG and I didn't think the song was all that great. After I saw the film the song took on an entirely new aspect and I loved it.Lastly, with the exception of Harrison Ford, who at that point in his career had not shed his action hero image, many of the actors in this film were not quite famous. Look for Kevin Spacy as a sleazy would be hiring boss, Oliver Platt who uses his supervisor position to act as a pimp, Joan Cusak reminds us why the 80's are known for ""big hair"", and a young Alec Baldwin who was busy trying to establish himself as an actor and not passing on his political ideology.",Working Girl

I learned a lot of lessons about dress sense after watching this movie and it's helped me till date.

82,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,Two Roses Surrounded By Thorns in Corporate America,10,13 January 2021,"Working Girl is a special film, not just as underdog story meets romantic comedy, not just because of the amazing 80s hair and wardrobe, but also because two angelic characters are surrounded by so many devils. In list form below you will find the Bottom 25 countdown to the most depraved character as well as a glowing tribute to the two who showed us the light.25: Tim Draper (Timothy Carhart) works for Trask Industries as head media consultant. He generally has a sneering look on his face and is condescending when he hears the Metro Radio pitch, but otherwise relatively benign.24: Helicopter Pilot (Mario DeFelice, Jr. or Anthony Mancini, Jr., not sure which Junior has the speaking part) drops off Katharine Parker at the heliport, clearly annoyed with her antics while she is under the influence of a muscle relaxer. He seems impatient, but maybe he has to get refueled and fly somewhere else so ranked low here.23: Alice Baxter (Amy Aquino) is Tess McGill's assistant at the new position working for Trask Industries. Her only crime is putting her feet up on the boss's desk before Tess even got to sit in it once, but she deserves somewhat of a pass considering that her boss was clearly late to work despite it being her first day.22: Bridesmaid (Ricki Lake) simply acted carelessly. When stranger and crasher Jack Trainer approaches her to ask questions about wedding guest Elizabeth Summerfield (and clearly has an ulterior motive), she willingly gives him enough info to advance his agenda with Ms. Summerfield despite the careless bridesmaid having no idea what that agenda might be.21: Trask Receptionist (Suzanne Shepherd) was at the upstairs desk when Tess McGill shows up late to her first day working at Trask. Instead of walking Tess back to her work space and introducing her to #23 ranked Alice Baxter, she gives Tess vague directions and causes the awkward misunderstanding that inevitably ensues. However the receptionist may have been distracted by her daughter Karen's difficulties with gangster husband Henry Hill.20: Bridegroom Mark (Tom Rooney) apparently remarks offscreen to new bride Phyllis Trask that their tropical-themed wedding reception ""looks like Nicaragua"" and is ""making a political statement."" First, why complain about the decor now, either he did not bother to find out what the reception theme was or he knew and picked the worst time to whine about it, ruining the bride's big day. Second, with Iran-Contra in the recent past and the duly elected Sandinista government still being under siege in 1988 by Reagan-backed insurrectionists it is simply in poor taste.19: Lobby Front desk receptionist at Trask Industries (unknown) displays a clear double standard while ostensibly having to check her desktop list before admitting visitors. When Jack Trainer and Tess McGill arrive at the first meeting together Jack says ""Trainer and McGill"" as he breezes past the desk. The receptionist only says ""Yes top of the stairs"" without even looking down at the alleged list and could not possibly have known who they are as it is their first time meeting at Trask's office. Compare this to the next time Tess arrives for a meeting, this time alone, wherein the same receptionist has to peruse her list before admitting Tess who had just visited days before.18: Armbrister (Robert Easton) owns Metro Radio and has clearly cultivated the look and style of an antebellum plantation owner. That is all.17: Cyn (Joan Cusack) is Tess McGill's best friend and former co-worker. Though she is mainly a good friend she sides with McGill's cheating boyfriend when the chips are down and invites the woman he cheated with to an engagement party that Tess will also attend.16: Tim Rourke (Jeffrey Nordling) goads Tess McGill's boyfriend into an awkward public marriage proposal at the aforementioned engagement party despite certainly being aware that Tess just caught the same boyfriend in their bed with another woman days before.15: Personnel Director (Olympia Dukakis) engages in shameful victim-blaming and continually downplays the sexual harassment Tess has endured in multiple job placements.14: Ginny (Nora Dunn) exhibits a constantly condescending demeanor toward Tess, who she clearly views as below her, and keeps calling Ms. McGill ""Bess"" which is not even a name.13: Bess McGill (Melanie Griffith) is the focus and star of the film, and Griffith was recognized with a well-deserved Oscar nomination. However, Bess is not without her share of blame. Snooping through private tapes, impersonating a superior officer in the Petty Marsh department of Mergers and Acquisitions, squatting in the Parker family's vacant townhouse, wearing Parker clothes and popping Parker pills, crashing a wedding reception and causing immediate marital doubt and suspicion by claiming to be a ""friend"" of the groom that the bride never heard of, and just more lies, lies, lies. It is her lack of concern for how cold a pizza is getting during a slow walk home, though, that really says something about her priorities.12: Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) steals the audience's heart, but should he? We first encounter Jack at a Dewey Stone party/mixer where he spots Tess sitting alone at the open bar. He zooms in on her before another cad gets the chance, despite having a serious girlfriend (who happens to be out of the country). When he realizes she is the same woman he is scheduled to meet with the next day, the woman who WORKS WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND and even dropped his girlfriend's name on the initial call to set up the meeting, he bumbles forward. Pressuring Tess to pound double shots of tequila gold he eventually carries her unconscious body up to his bachelor pad where she wakes up the next morning with her dress off. Though he later claims nothing happened, one wonders.11: Man digging in the trash receptacle outside dry cleaners (unknown) is just showing his whole naked butt to the world while he bends over the can searching for treasure. Pull your pants up sir.10: Oren Trask (Philip Bosco) makes it a point to surround himself with exclusively white executives at work and exclusively white friends at his daughters wedding. Contrast this with his uniformed manservants standing in the background at all times. To top it off he comments inappropriately on the boniness of the posterior of a female executive.9: Turkel (James Lally) is Tess McGill's direct supervisor at her job in the beginning of the film. With a policy that his assistant must come in the men's room to notify him of any calls, the broker then berates her for his own failure to check for toliet paper before he sat down on the pot to dump UPS stock. Worse, he aids and abets fellow tool David Lutz in his despicable pimpery.8: Doreen DiMucci (Elizabeth Whitcraft) is caught in bed with Tess's boyfriend Mick when Tess arrives home early. Relationships are complicated, and Mick is the one who owes Tess the fidelity. However, Doreen keeps hanging around the group of friends even when Tess is there whereas she should be finding new friends, and then Doreen has the nerve to look upset when Mick clumsily proposes to Tess.7: Phyllis Trask (Barbara Garrick) was the catalyst for the Trask-radio idea when Tess read a blurb on Page Six about a charity benefit organized by Ms. Trask featuring talk radio host Bobby Stine. The same Bobby Stine famous for ""Ethiopia jokes."" Ha ha Phyllis, real funny.6: Mick Dugan (Alexander Baldwin III) is a dirty cheater, that much has been established. He also has a strange obsession wherein the only gift he ever willingly buys a woman is lingerie.5: David Lutz (Oliver Platt) is a sleazoid pimp.4: Jim (Zach Grenier) is a lecherous junior executive who cannot keep his hands off Katharine Parker at a crowded Petty Marsh company meet and greet. When he finally stops his grimy assault and turns to look at Tess she immediately needs to return to her dim sum steam bath to cleanse herself from his filthy gaze.3: Bob Speck (Kevin Spacey) epitomizes the randy Wall Street cokeboy, trying to cop a feel on Tess as he plays a creepy adult film on the limousine VCR during their fortunately brief meeting. Spacey was already deep into character years before he got the role.2: Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) is a 29 year old quickly rising through the ranks at Petty Marsh. Born into a wealthy family, she attended the most expensive schools and had every advantage. This is what makes her theft of intellectual property, Tess's Trask-radio idea, even more vile. Her attitude toward Tess being late for a doctor's appointment (which was admittedly made up but KP did not know this) is but a window into her callous heart as she demands Tess run to the drugstore (""The doctor will understand"").1: Cab driver (Steve Cody) is the worst of the worst. After Jack joins intoxicated Tess in the cab outside the Dewey Stone mixer the driver could clearly hear that groggy Tess in the back seat was with a man who did not even know where she lived, and in her stupor Tess could not even give her own address. The driver then proceeds to take them to Jack's apartment and leaves her alone with the potential rapist, pulling away without a word as Jack carries Tess's limp form over his shoulder.Now after all that unpleasantness, the Top 2 redeeming characters:1 (tie): Elizabeth ""Bitsy"" Summerfield (Marceline Hugot) is another Bridesmaid being used as a tool in the Trainer-McGill crashing scheme. When surprised by a ""Bitsy don't break my heart and tell me you don't remember me"" from total stranger Jack Trainer she politely responds with grace and pirouettes like a world-class ballerina.1 (tie): Clerk at dry cleaners (Lily Froelich) not only had to look at #11 trash can man's exposed buttocks through the store window but also kindly dashed after Tess to return the day planner that McGill so carelessly left on the counter.10/10",Working Girl

Tess asks Lutz on the day before the meeting.
""Do I look like a pimp?"" Lutz asks.
As it turns out Lutz (a terrific Oliver Platt) is a pimp.The meeting with Bob takes place in the back of a limo where Bob (in between snorts of cocaine) lamely keeps up the charade of a job interview for a few seconds before saying:""We'll discuss it at the hotel.""
""The hotel?""Kevin Spacey was great in this little role. Indeed a great part of the fun of watching this movie is seeing all these talented actors before they became famous.Their work really adds to the story.After spraying Bob with champagne, Tess (in a rage), heads to her office where she fire bombs her position at Lutz & Turkel, and ends up appealing to her employment agent again.""Tess...Tess..."" the woman says in dismay, ""You don't get ahead in this world by calling your boss a pimp.
""Well he is.""After admonishing her, the employment agent (played by Olympia Dukakis) gives her one last chance.Enter Katherine Parker, a role Sigourney Weaver was spectacular in.The only role I can safely say I liked her better in was as Dr. Helen Hudson in Copycat (and that's probably
because I prefer the character).Everyone (including the audience) wants to believe that Tess's stylish new boss is her friend, but it isn't long before the facade wears off, and Katherine's claws start to come out.When Tess comes up with a brainstorm for a business tycoon named Oren Trask (Phillip Bosco) to buy into radio in order to avoid a take over, Katherine promises to give the idea a ""go around"" to see what happens.The following day, as Tess is helping Katherine into her ski boots, the latter confides her plans to go away for the weekend with boyfriend Jack Trainer whom, she is certain, is about to pop the question.""But what if he doesn't?"" Tess asks
""I really don't think that's a variable. We're in the same city now. I've indicated that I would be receptive to an offer, I've cleared the month of June, and I am, after all...me.""She then, mournfully, confesses that Tess's idea was rejected, but encourages her to keep up the good work.
The following day, Katherine breaks her leg while doing some over confident skiing (the scene leading up to this is hysterical), and has to ask Tess to watch her house while she convalesces in Aspen.And it's precisely at her boss's house (while listening to her boss's tape recorder) that Tess finds out the truth about her idea:That Katherine was stealing it. That she was about to take it to Trask, using it to boost her own career.That night she goes home to find her boyfriend Mick (Alec Baldwin) in bed with another woman.Her sense of trust shattered, and having no one but her best friend Cynthia (Joan Cusack), Tess decides to take matters into her own hands.She has Cynthia cut her hair, wears Katherine's six thousand dollar evening gown, and goes to a corporate social function to meet Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford, of course), to see if they can team up together to broker a deal with Trask concerning Tess's radio idea.Jack, who never made it to Aspen, and was (we learn later) about to break up 
with Katherine, is quite taken with Tess whom, he believes, to be a high power executive.Cynthia pretends to be her secretary, and Jack, who was told the previous one was stolen, buys her a new briefcase.The deal goes quite smoothly, and there's even a hysterically funny wedding reception scene which lightens the movie considerably.The trouble comes when Katherine returns unexpectedly, which would be, of course, on the very day they're going to close the deal, and upon finding out her secretary's activities, sets out to destroy Tess, and all her dreams...

85,calsonassociates,Google gives some good statistics about women in 1988 and now in 2021!,10,6 November 2021,"In filmmaking, major examinations of the history in which the relationship between the public and the private realms designed to deny women a fair chance for full participation is refreshing when feeling this movie. Here, some men and few women, in establishing civil society, do so from a perspective that suggests that women do not have the same or similar attributes needed as those capacities in men. I disagree. Patriarchy changes all for the better when equal protection in film history looks carefully at the real world of today. Thank you kindly.",Working Girl
86,anuraagti,Crazy that this is just a 6.8,9,26 August 2020,"It's cheesy, but so beautifully made. Perfect popcorn fare about the American dream, and so well made, by an immigrant!Very very relevant in these troubling times, something every American should watch, to remind themselves about the best part of their culture, and its universal message. Yes, this is just a movie, but it is still rooted in a culture and value system.And it's just so nice watching these actors back in their heyday. Hard to believe this movie is 32 years old!",Working Girl
87,JaysonT,The best film of 1988,10,11 January 2010,"How can you not love this movie? It's easily the best movie to come out of Hollywood in 1988, not just because of its winsome charm and observant hilarity, but because you can watch it over and over and still find freshness in the story.Melanie Griffith, in her only great role, is Tess McGill. She's smart, good on her feet but suffers from being taken as a tart, mainly because she's a good looking blonde and talks like Marilyn Monroe. She works as a secretary in New York, but quits when her first boss turns out to be a sleaze. Her next job is also that of a secretary, but her boss is more like able. Enter Katharine Parker, played by the brilliantly endowed Sigourney Weaver, who Tess warms up to more because a) Katharine is a woman, and b) Katharine seems inclined to help Tess move up.But the cards are changed when Katharine is in a skiing accident, and Tess is forced to take over. She doesn't mind, until she finds out Katharine was going to steal one of her ideas to turn the industry they work for into a radio network. Now it's payback time. After also discovering her boyfriend, Alec Baldwin, is cheating on her, Tess goes into high gear to get her idea heard by the big leagues- even if it means posing as a boss- before her boss gets back.All of this may sound very predictable, but director Mike Nichols is so wise in making the characters seem fresh and fun that you never worry. The stakes are set on high ground, and Tess is competing in a sexist society where men treat secretaries like dogs and women are expected to marry jerks like Baldwin. Enter Harrison Ford, who is perfectly toned down for the occasion, who finds himself involved with Griffith because he's the guy who can pull the strings to close the deal Tess needs. The two form a partnership, and affair, that is both brisk and entertaining. Joan Cusack also has a fabulous role as Tess's best friend who has a money-stealing scene where she poses as Tess's secretary and can't help but liven the scene a bit more.""Working Girl"" was nominated for 6 Academy Awards in 1988, winning a deserved song trophy. But It should have taken a few more. While Griffith was charming and cute as Tess, I do think Jodie Foster deserved the Oscar more for ""The Accused"" (and Meryl Streep should have won for ""A Cry in the Dark"" if we're being frank). But Sigourney Weaver was robbed the Oscar for best supporting actress for playing the snooty, conniving boss. It suits Weavers perfectly that she only is in the first and last parts of the film, but every second she's on screen she owns. She radiantly plays it coy and sheek, and submerges into more deviant tactics without going over the top. Watch, for example, the scene where Weaver coolly explains to Griffith that she can't get anywhere in life waiting for opportunity to come to her. It's subtle but strong in the message that indicates Weaver knows she's better then Griffith, and will always have the thrown of success. Weaver lost to one of my favorites, Geena Davis in ""The Accidental Tourist"". I love Davis in the role, but I love Weaver more. Davis should have won for ""Thelma & Louise."" ""Working Girl"" is one of best comedies ever made. The pacing, timing and accuracy of all the characters and their motives are perfectly matched.",Working Girl
88,jazzfi,Pleasant fare,7,21 March 2015,"Entertaining movie that is worth watching again and again, especially for the climatic comeuppance finale... Good performances by Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver as the back stabbing conniving boss, and Melanie Griffith, smart but naive in the ways of this fictional corporate world.Still, most of us wonder why women like our heroine continually choose low life degenerate losers the likes of those portrayed in this film by Alec Baldwin--- selfish, demanding, abusive, unfaithful... I mean, is it for the female viewers? Is Nick the type of guy most women generally fall for and would like to see as the boyfriend? So anyways, Tess comes up with a brilliant plan to get a large corporation to acquire a radio station, shares it with her boss who promptly steals it with the intention of selling as her own, the truth eventually comes out and our villainous boss is hung out to dry, and Harrison Ford and Melanie Griffith live happily ever actor.",Working Girl
89,csimpkins53,katharine's office,7,17 June 2015,"If Katherine and Jack are so close to being married why does Jack not know that Tess is in Katherine's office? I would think that if a couple is that close to being married they would be quite familiar with each others offices. Anyway, I do like this movie. I've probably seen it 7 or eight times. I'm a heterosexual male, I love women and consider myself to be a gentleman and I feel so sorry for Tess in the horrible way that nearly everyone treats her! The character of Tess is that of a good woman and it hurts me to see a good woman mistreated. With the exception of Jack and her fellow secretaries almost everyone treats her like dirt! Including her sleazy ""boyfriend"" played by Alec Baldwin, her low as pond scum male co-workers not to mention the quintessential bitch Katherine! All of this, of course eventually results in a great ""feel good"" ending which causes me to cheer for Tess's triumph!",Working Girl
90,ericventura,"At Least, It was Funny",3,27 June 2017,"The epitome of cliché, Working Girl takes your typical rags to riches story taking place in the male-dominated business world, inserts strong female characters, and turns the film into a particularly good feminist anthem. While the movie does have strongly developed themes, it is not good. It's a funny romantic comedy, but that does not excuse the blatant, overdone stupidity of the whole production.There is nothing special about this movie. Nothing technically appealing, visually stunning, or cinematically special. So the screenplay, in order to make this banal movie more appetizing, flips the gender roles, making this rom-com more interesting, but ultimately the same movie. Better and more sophisticated than Clueless (1995), it still falls far short of When Harry Met Sally (1989). The people making this film must have patted themselves on the back for their clever film, failing to see the façade that it truly is. They put a masquerade mask to hide the pathetic truth of this movie. But it's really just a bland and unseasoned chicken with a little salt sprinkled on top.The acting of a few of the primary characters is quite good, while others fall as short as the film. Both Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford act well for the role, but not much more. However, their dynamic together is truly felt and earns the film at least one point for some authenticity. Sigourney Weaver's performance seems tasteless and stiff, typical of the mean boss. Joan Cusack is the only true star in this movie, capturing the energy and eccentricity of her character, creating humor and making her scenes enjoyable.There's not much else to this bland film. At least, it was funny.",Working Girl
91,microbonnie,Contains enough truth and enough humor to be entertaining!,7,7 January 1999,"I saw ""Working Girl"" because Sigourney Weaver is one of my favorite actresses.. also because Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor (even though his part in this movie lasts about a minute or two), and neither of them disappointed me.  Neither did the movie, in fact, though it might seem shallow to some.  The story was solid, the characters were well-cast; Sigourney Weaver was hilarious!  Maybe this movie wasn't too deep or realistic, but it was very amusing...",Working Girl

93,Criti-Size,go Melanie!,7,26 January 2004,This was a fun movie where the audience is rooting for the 'underdog' played by Melanie Griffith. This film has a great cast and is a must-see for anyone who has ever worked in a office environment. Watch for Joan Cusack who almost steals the film.,Working Girl
94,cafm,Cinderella Inc.,10,23 July 2012,"From its opening aerial shot of the Statue of Liberty and the Staten Island ferry on which Tess McGill (Melanie Griffiths) makes a wish for a chance to take a bite out of the Big Apple, to the closing aerial shot of her chatting with her best friend Cyn from her new office digs at Trask, Working Girl is a wonderful example of the Cinderella fairytale retold by a virtuoso filmmaker. Griffiths makes a charming Cinderella, full of wit, wiles and chutzpah, while Harrison Ford makes a dashing Prince Charming and Sigourney Weaver is incredibly good as the Evil Stepmother. Going back to that impressive opening shot in which a graphic match effortlessly joins an external helicopter shot of the ferry with an internal dolly shot inside the ferry, I just want to state how magical I think this sequence is as it immediately and effortlessly moves us into a film that is essentially a propaganda piece about the American dream. The American dream is a very old idea about America as the land of opportunity and for a long time I suppose that was true for everyone except its indigenous population, its African American population, its Hispanic population ... For centuries people from all over the world have traveled to America in the hope of working hard and accumulating wealth and living a life they could never have had in their own country. It is not a coincidence that Nichols starts his film with his impressive aerial shot of the Statue of Liberty. When immigrants used to travel from Europe to America by boat, she first thing they would see when they reached America. The camera moves around the statue and as it pulls away we see the Staten Island ferry and the camera moves closer and closer until we are inside the ferry and see the mass of commuters on their way to Manhattan Island. This image recalls the thousands of immigrants arriving in America by boat. When we are taken inside the ferry, we meet Tess and her best friend Cyn. It's Tess's birthday and as she blows out the candles on a cupcake and Cyn asks Tess if she's made a birthday wish, we see a look of longing and determination on Tess' face, indicating that she has indeed made a wish. We come back to this wish at the end of the film when we see that, through hard work, determination and good business sense it has been granted. Office towers have a hierarchy that is organised from outside in. The window offices are reserved for managers while the corner window offices with those impressive panoramas go to upper management and partners. Inside the office, away from the windows and closer to the elevator shafts are the secretarial workstations and clerical functions that serve management and carry out their decisions. In the final sequence of the film, Tess arrives at this typical configuration ignorant of the fact that her status has changed. This actually makes her all the more charming and endearing. She is surprised to find that she has moved from inside the secretarial pool and been given a window office, demonstrating that she has at last successfully made that significant first step into management, moving up the corporate ladder. An important shot/reverse shot in this sequence shows Tess standing up against the window while Alice, her secretary is positioned in a corner with walls around her. The two are discussing manager/secretary protocol and Alice, who is at first defensive, quickly warms to her new unassuming boss. Alice is now where Tess used to be, reminding us where Tess has come from and how she has managed to achieve the American Dream. This is virtuoso use of the shot/reverse shot as Tess, framed against the window, is now in a world that is open to new possibilities - the world is now her oyster while Alice remains enclosed by walls, demonstrating the difference in the two women's status. Once alone in her new office, Tess calls her best friend Cyn, but unlike the start of the film where they are side-by-side, now they are separated by geography and status. A cut to Tess and a crash zoom outwards shows her still stuck in a cavernous, heavily crowded office, nevertheless elated for her friend and celebrating with us the endless possibilities available to those willing to risk it all to achieve their dreams, with a ""head for business and a body for sin.""",Working Girl
95,diana_m_j,Entertaining and Fun,9,16 November 2019,"This is a movie that I go back to time and again when I need a little feel-good ""pick me up."" It is well acted and directed, and delivers big with 80s nostalgia (literally and figuratively). Who doesn't love to see the mistreated underdog achieve his/her dreams? I can be in the worst mood when I press play, but this movie leaves me smiling and happy by the end.That said, it isn't perfect. While I still adore this movie to the point that I can overlook the blatant inconsistencies in the story line, I feel they should be pointed out:1) Melanie Griffith's character, Tess McGill, is painted as an intelligent, well-read, ambitious, educated woman who is more than capable of an executive-level role - she just needs that one big chance to prove herself. Why then, would she not have figured out some critical parts of the equation long ago? For example (in the beginning of the film), she looks about as unprofessional as it gets. She has big and wild hair, wears excessive amounts of tacky jewelry and makeup, and the hemlines of her skirts are a tad high. You would think that someone as observant and insightful as she is supposed to be would be savvy enough to observe the women she is trying to become and would do her best (albeit on a limited budget) to appear professional and conservative. ""Dress for the job you want, not the job you have"" is surely something she would have picked up on along the way. She also speaks in a thick ""Noo Yawk"" accent. She only decides to change her image (including her accent) once she spends a couple of weeks with her boss, Katherine (Sigourney Weaver). She perfects a more neutral accent in short order by listening to recordings of her boss speaking. For the rest of the film, you never hear her slip into her old accent again. Sure, ok. None of this makes logical sense, but her complete transformation was necessary for the ""Cinderella-rags-to-riches"" element of the story, I suppose.2) If Tess is so smart, humble, and genuine, how on earth would she remain in a long-term, serious relationship with her chauvinistic and demeaning boyfriend Mick (Alec Baldwin)? All he tries to do is hold her back. He has no respect for her or her ambitions. The bright Tess would have kicked him to the curb long ago. Again, a necessary plot point, but makes no sense whatsoever.3) Similarly, why would Harrison Ford's character Jack Trainer, who apparently possesses Tess's good-natured traits, have been with the snobby elitist Katherine for so long? Yes, he was trying to break it off, but c'mon. Another plot point that was necessary, but quite unrealistic. He would never have been attracted for very long to someone with her dry, holier-than-thou attitude and personality.4) I wish there was more character development for our three leads, Tess, Jack, and Katherine. You never hear of their childhoods or backgrounds (Katherine's was hinted at, but never really expanded upon). What were their family dynamics like, growing up? What shaped their ambitions and attitudes? I would have loved to learn more about that, as they are all interesting characters that probably have interesting backstories.Ok, those are my issues with the story. You will notice that I still rated this film 9 stars, despite all of my criticisms. I did that because it really IS *that good* and achieves what it set out to do. At the end of the day, it is a movie, and movies are often not realistic - even very good ones (I am looking at you, Forrest Gump). It is also meant to be a satire. So yeah - I LOVE this film and will continue to watch it again and again.",Working Girl
96,jmille42,Top 5 Film Class Movies: FILM #3,7,28 July 2005,"First off, no, this is not a film you have to go to the back room of your local video store to get. It is my number 3 favorite from film class, Working Girl. Melanie Griffith stars as the overachieving Tess, a young woman with great ideas who always ends up with the short end of the stick when it comes to career opportunities. Her new demanding boss Katharine (Sigourney Weaver), injures herself in a ski accident, leaving Griffith the keys to her office and home. When she finds out the deceptive Katharine steals her idea to acquire media outlets for profit, Tess takes matters into her own hands along with the help of the clueless business partner Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford).Corporate life has its ups, buy mostly consists of downs which the award winning Mike Nichols portrays through the dominated young career woman who cannot find a trustworthy friend (besides the ditzy Joan Cusack, who was nominated for an Oscar for this film). Melanie Griffith brings this character beauty and strength, which one would not expect from someone who is so often looked over. She practically has to steal her bosses identity to be heard, which can be seen today in most businesses where it's not ""what you know,"" it's ""who you know."" Nichols seems to bring more laughs with this film, showing some stereotypical aspects of unfaithful boyfriends and arrogant successes. The story is perfect and the acting is superb. It is good to see that early in her career, Melanie actually made some good movies.",Working Girl
97,jeannel2003-618-511281,"Even Flawed, One of the Best Romantic Comedies of All Time",9,26 May 2010,"This move is one of my all-time favorites! I never get tired of watching this David-and-Goliath-themed adventure with a feminist twist. And, although it has some LOL scenes, I always choke up over the final scene and closing credits with Carly Simon's fabulous score.The entire cast is excellent, and I agree that this is the best romantic role ever for Harrison Ford, and one of the best roles, period, of his career. Harrison has often looked uncomfortable playing domestic roles,but he is at the top of his game in this one. Sigourney Weaver is spot on as the beautiful and polished, but underhanded boss. Joan Cusack is hilarious, as always, as the heroine's loyal best friend in the secretarial pool; she has the bimbo look and routine down. And, Melanie Griffith is wonderful as the vulnerable yet steely 30-year-old secretary at a crossroads in her life and career. It is not surprising that the movie garnered one Oscar, Oscar nominations for Melanie, Sigourney and Joan, and Golden Globe awards.The film is so inspirational and charming that one can overlook its few flaws: (1) Apparently Jack never contacts is alleged girlfriend, Katherine, when she has a skiing accident; the two seem on the verge of becoming engaged but yet they obviously have not spoken the entire time she is laid up outside the country with broken bones. Even if Jack was planning to break off the relationship with Katherine, surely he would have called to inquire after health! (2) As Tess lives with her cheating boyfriend, where does she hang her hat between the time that they break up and before she, at least temporarily, moves in with Jack? (3) How does Katherine manage to bluff her way into Tess's and Jack's deal when she does not have all the facts? Surely, she would have been found out earlier than the film indicates.Despite these strange oversights, the film manages to make sense in the way the way that fun, audacious plots often do. And, the best part is that even today the film provides feminist history and inspiration to a new generation of young women.",Working Girl

99,niborskaya,"Bright, feel-good comedy...George Cukor - move over!",10,10 September 2007,"It's up there with any of screwball comedies of the 30s... Carole Lombard, Jean Arthur, Margaret Sullivan. a modern classic...and that's not hyperbole!I've been watching this movie every now and again for almost 20 years (ye gads!), and it's always entertaining. Tonight, I noticed how effective and subtle an actress Melanie Griffith can be when she's directed well. She's a real jewel in this film. Sweet, sexy, smart with a ""brain for business and a bod for sin"". Mike Nichols clearly loved filming her. Her expressions are priceless. Watch for the wonderful scene when Harrison Ford and she are walking to the elevator and he's asking her out. That face of hers as the elevator doors close is just heavenly. That's Mike Nichols craft/artistry.Sigourney Weaver also does a masterful job as a two-faced shark business woman. What's so wonderful about her character, the writing, is that Katherine doesn't have a conscience. She's crafty and slick and manipulative, but she's not out to hurt anyone, just put herself first. It's too bad if anyone get's in her way. She's not nasty, but there is no question that she is the most important person in the universe. It's interesting, too, how her duplicity is reflected in her wardrobe. Most of the professional women in the movie are dressed in ultra-conservative boxy business attire, but Katherine/Sigourney dresses sophisticatedly and elegantly. She knows how to play both sides, the professional yet still sexy professional. She's so powerful in herself that she doesn't feel like she has to dress like a man just because she's in a male- dominated career (mergers/acquisitions). yes, she's a monster/ogre, but as she states, ""This is BUSINESS"".Harrison Ford is his usual witty, slightly befuddled nice guy. He's the James Stewart of the baby boomer generation.Joan Cusack is a phenomenon with her iridescent eye-shadow and Bozo hairdo. I think has the funniest line in the movie-a warning to Tess: ""You know, sometimes I sing and dance around the apartment in my underwear. Doesn't make me Madonna....never will"". that's rich.Look for Ricki Lake at the wedding.I put this movie in the same category as Moonstruck, Educating Rita, Shirley Valentine. Transformation movies. I suppose you could call them modern day Cinderella Stories, but it's more about the women saving themselves as opposed to waiting for Prince Charming.It's a pleasure to see this movie. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",Working Girl
100,Linnell,Excellent Capra-esque comedy/drama,9,1 March 1999,"If you are one for those Capra films of the '30s, where the underdog struggles to to top, fighting lies and unjustice en route, 'Working Girl' is your kind of film. Transpose 'Mr Smith goes to Washington' into the late 80s, swap the leads' genders, exchange Washington for Wall St and you are there. The nervous anticipation of Tess as she enters the top-level board meeting with Trask exactly mirrors Smith's first steps inside the Senate. Both characters hit rock bottom and apparent disaster minutes before the end of the film and are then saved and vindicated by a 'miracle'. The seamless blend of comedy, romance, drama and tension is there in both. Even the gift of a new briefcase is common as a symbol of the new status.A major difference is that Tess' motivation is self-improvement and has to break a few rules to get what she wants (although none that no one else is breaking) unlike Smith's passion for the truth at all costs. 'Working Girl' does not have the same serious depth of 'Mr Smith', but that probably to its advantage, and doesn't quite have the 1939 film's breadth of vision or masterful direction. But it is still a superb movie that can be enjoyed more with each viewing and, apart from its portrayal business technology, hasn't dated or lost its edge in over 10 years. A good example, too, of a movie where the theme song and soundtrack augment the characters and story perfectly. There are also some subtle messages about gender identity in the business world.",Working Girl
101,acheapmom,Qualified College Grad Secretary Skipped Over--Scenario True to Life--Only the Resolution is Fantasy!,9,3 February 2009,"This is a movie some teen girls (and some clueless men) will not ""get""! Melanie Griffith's slightly irritating ""little girl"" voice and her fragile ""puff of smoke will blow me away"" demeanor means that many will not see her as strong and as smart as the tough corporate exec that her boss Sigourney Weaver plays. (The film shows that there's a bit of class snobbery at work in such firms then---and now!)But many such delicate appearing women are as tough as - lionesses - in desiring to achieve success. My manager sister, for instance. If you do not KNOW this from observation, you are simply too young, too sheltered, or too clueless! What makes this film NOT dated (except for the ""big hair, 80's styles"") is that many women out there have ideas, opportunities spoiled by exec. WOMEN (as well as exec. men). (I know a ruthless female boss who stole an underling woman's ideas...What could she do??? It was at a firm dealing in mergers like this one, also!!!) Sigourney Weaver's patronizing superior treatment of Griffith's character is DEAD ON ACCURATE for how I (and some friends) have been treated by exec. women!Maybe only the office males trying to trade sex for work opportunities are ""dated"" since they are a ""sexual lawsuit target waiting to happen"" nowadays.So---I really like this film but wish it did not have the gratuitous brief sex scenes which add nothing to the main, powerful story line.An edited version of this film - viewed on a family friendly channel - might be a great discussion starter with both your teen son -and Daughter!",Working Girl
102,Seasuzie,Classic 1980s NYC secretary movie!,10,14 October 2019,Being a secretary in the late 80s from Queens I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Plus I worked with some ladies from Staten Island who were stunning and had these strong NY accents. I loved it. Mellanie G at her best. Great cast and scenes of NYC. This is a movie that captures a moment in time. Probably wouldn't have been made today. Two woman in conflict. Too controversial lol.

103,danny-60,A pretty tale,8,5 February 2000,"Last Monday I reviewed Working Girl and I couldn't help recording it on videotape. Both Melanie and Sigourney are very good, I like them. Harrison, as always, is here as if were in any other movie he has made: he always is the same character, I think.The best thing in the movie is Melanie as Tess. You see how she has to stand a situation she never shearched for, but going into in order to get what is hers. At the end, you enjoy how Tess teach Sigourney the lesson.The Best Soundtrack Oscar was very very much well deserved. Carly Simon's `Let the River Run' is marvelous.

Although this movie took place in 1988, the actors (Melanie, Sigourney, Harrison, and Joan) still look good! I loved this movie, and I watch it when I'm feeling like life isn't working out in my favor. Harrison was his usual handsome,funny, romantic but serious self. Melanie was her usual beautiful, funny, get down to business self. Sigorney, however, was unusually convincing as a bit**y boss. I loved the wedding scene when they first arrive and the man greeted them; gesturing 'come in, come in, tip of the hat, and this is the party!'

106,jon-fougner-966-434081,Reflections from YLS Capitalism + Film Seminar,7,6 February 2013,"Your labor earns while you're awake; your capital, even while you're asleep—in tension with the Protestant work ethic. Mike Nichols' Working Girl (1988) explores that tension through two interlocking earning- without-quite-working case studies: an industry, and a young woman.Fox released Working Girl in the heyday of the 1980s buyout boom and associated Hollywood lionization of M&A, just a year after Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Investment bankers were Masters of the Universe, for they had cracked its code: earning capital-like income without capital. By steering CEOs' use of balance sheet cash to buy other companies and taking a percentage commission, advisors generated fee income that scaled with capital without having to carry the capital themselves, as in the underwriting business. And unlike their Harvard and MIT classmates toiling away in cubicles as engineers at IBM, these Wall Streeters did it all with snappy suits and cocktail party banter, or so the meme went. Capitalism without capital, work without work.Enter B&T'er Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith). And how else? Through the madding crowd, via the Staten Island ferry, past the Statute of Liberty— for, the dream of Manhattan is nothing if not a meritocracy to all- comers. Cast and caste as the new ingénue, Tess exudes the charming naiveté of imagining that success in investment banking rides on hard work (as opposed to) and thus that it's gender-blind. Nichols wastes no time dispensing with this notion. When Tess, a secretary, tracks down her boss (Oliver Platt) in the men's room to run a short sale idea by him, we hear another man's voice: ""There's no paper!"" For a split second, we and Tess think he might be replying to the short sale idea in Wall Street jargon. But no, he's just looking to wipe his ass, and we feel Tess deflate.Of course, even in a gender-blind meritocracy, toilet paper is the sort of paper one would ask for in a men's room, and if a woman comes in, she can hardly begrudge being the target of the request. So maybe that's it: if only Tess didn't think she had to break the rules to get ahead, she have a fair shake at career advancement, we speculate as she walks back to her desk. Not so: Tess's boss arranges a supposed job interview with a colleague, but he turns out to be a coke-addled molester (Kevin Spacey, disturbingly believable as usual, in a bit part). At least she manages to even the score, spraying his bottle of Dom all over him and his limo.And here we encounter one of Nichols' core themes for expressing the thinness of the work of investment banking: it's just a smokescreen for recreational sex. Impotence, then, amounts to professional incompetence. Hence when Tess storms back to the office and gives her boss his comeuppance by programming the ticker tape to read that he's poorly endowed, his work there is done, and off he goes. Indeed, the most gender parity to be found in Nichols' Wall Street is that men are sex objects as much as women. The object of Tess's professional and (eventually) romantic aspirations, fellow i-banker Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), is ogled by the women in his office when he changes shirts, and we ultimately suspect he intended to sleep his way to the top with his romance with Tess's new boss Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver, in a sharp turn as a woman who climbed early with no intention of helping others do the same). But he resists any temptation to take advantage of Tess's Valium- and tequila-induced stupor the night the two first meet (""I have a head for business and a bod for sin,"" she tells him in a line that surely made the trailer editor rewind his VCR), preserving his status as the light at the end of Tess's tunnel.The rest of her striving is thick with thinness, too. A new suit and a lower voice (the latter which Trainer comes to borrow from her, in a nice touch by Ford and Nichols) and, voilà!, she's a senior investment banker. Who needs to sweat over spreadsheets for underlings when you can crash the CEO's daughter's wedding? Who needs a team when you can ""fly solo""? Who needs numbers before you've gotten the client ""excited about the concept""? Who needs to tell colleagues and lovers the truth when you've got a better narrative? Nichols leaves us to try and sort out whether it's M&A advisory that's flimsy or Tess, whether she corrupts the practice from its analytical moorings or perfects its fundamental vapidity.None of the above, it turns out. Nichols' Hollywood ending vindicates the core values with which Tess embarked on careerism: resourcefulness, diligence, and most of all, creativity. From that foundation sprung her idea for a Trask radio acquisition, and from it now springs proof that the idea was hers all along. (Contrast Katherine's flat ""Let's merge!"" marital command to Jack.) And this is where the investment banking industry ultimately earns it keep: new perspectives on how to deploy capital at greatest marginal productivity. The bow that Nichols ties here is big enough to wrap up the interrelated theme of uneasiness at whether the softer sex is really working in the workplace: indeed they are, and the new perspectives brought by this previously excluded segment of the workforce offer the greatest marginal productivity to their firms. To make clear that that's about a lot more than following Page Six, Nichols closes on an earnest scene of Tess explaining to her new secretary—she's a newly minted Trask executive—how she is ushering in her more respectful brand of leadership. Having shown that she can be trusted with other's capital—physical and human—she's moved from advisory into industry and been put in charge of some of her own.",Working Girl
107,glennofthewood,The feel-good movie of the century,10,24 March 2021,Working Girl is a modern Cinderella story with a perfect cast and a perfect ending. This movie is one to watch over and over. The feel-good movie of the century.,Working Girl
108,KaylaMaster,Love this movie but there's an enormous flaw....,7,20 February 2016,"Despite Melanie Griffith's weak characterization and other quirk's, I still love this movie. Usually have to watch at least some of it when it finds it's way to my TV once again.Here's the quirk that has always bothered me: (Don't think it's a spoiler, so I have not checked it as such) ""Cyn"" is her friend at the very beginning of the movie. The opening scene has them walking to work. Tess leaves that job and goes to work elsewhere. Funny, she's in the exact same secretarial pool as Cyn? Neither of them mention it, yet Cyn is always there in the same office. That's quite a convenient coincidence! Also, it's fascinating how much business has been demonized in recent years. What used to be a triumph of feminism...that women can be just as effective in business as men, has now become a hatred of business all together. How sad. This limits women's choices, rather than broadens them. There was a time when women longed to use their brain in a setting like this. Sure, it's not for everyone, but isn't it allowed to be for someone?The movie itself, is a great piece of fluff that's just plain fun to watch again and again",Working Girl
109,yaykisspurr,"A Timeless ""Stand Up for Yourself"" Romance",10,23 May 2012,"When a secretary's idea is stolen by her boss, she seizes an opportunity to steal it back by pretending she has her boss's job. Along the way she learns about love, lies and the hows to taking risks in life.I believe right from the opening you are exposed to just what she's up against: a male dominated management where women are secretaries and little else. I think this environment really worked because it wasn't personal. There was no vendetta, ulterior motive or manipulation. Men honestly thought women should remain secretaries and their place was in the bedroom. The movie's setup went quick: we knew the story's main focus was in the workplace and her career. When Mick was eventually introduced you knew he wasn't as keyed into her as he ought to be and that this didn't bode well. The secondary plot line of her love life and where she'd live quickly trotted along and you knew everything was on the line now.Tess really captured the feeling that she was playing everything by ear. You knew she wasn't afraid of risks or trying out an opportunity even if it didn't end well – that was the beauty of the opening scenes. I loved Melanie Griffith. To me it doesn't matter what else she's done or will do. She'll remain an actress to watch due to this role. Sometimes freedom to act on instinct is just what is needed for a role to come together.Harrison Ford though really added so much from his end as Jack Trainer. Right from his first meeting to his defense of her at the elevators he had this humor and earnest appeal that can't be fakedI know how much irony that holds but it's true. His character felt genuine with equal measure to her gutsiness.Sigourney Weaver really outdid herself as the manipulative boss who steals her subordinates ideas and set back women everywhere by several generations. She took Tess under her wing and made the woman bloom into awareness of her un-career worthiness. She even provided Tess an opportunity to grow by breaking her leg and loving it instead of hurrying home to work and boyfriend. Weaver embodied career women everywhere and her negative traits took her down.There were so many good scenes in Working Girl. From subtle moments like in the elevator scene I mentionedOr when Tess had the chandelier cleaned in Katharine's apartmentTo edge of your seat is she going to carry it off like in the wedding crasher scenes or the morning after meeting where she pitched her idea. Much of this movie stands out in my mind due to the dialogue. Every interaction snapped with tension and emotion. (Read some of the quotes!)Writing wise I hearken after the skill utilized to make each scene important to understanding the characters, to moving plot along and foreshadowing why and what is coming. To this end each of the main characters: Tess, Jack and Katharine, were treated as protagonist in their own stories. They each had setbacks to their plans, both good and bad sides to their character, triumphs, and goals they worked toward. What makes the protagonist in our story is simply a matter of outcome and maybe screen time.As a women in her twenties it's hard to know what dreams to pursue and what to let the universe and God decide. Overcoming obstacles and pursing opportunities are the choices you make that define who you are and how you'll turn out in the end. Working Girl is a prime example of how things work out when you have worthy goals and a gutsy attitude. Even today I can watch this movie and feel it's rightness, that life does fit together like a puzzle and part of the fun is putting it together through thick and thin.With divorce fracturing our families and homes, it's great to have an example for us that with the right outlook things will come together in our lives, no matter our history or backgrounds. As a child of divorce I find myself questioning motives and pondering actions to see if they need a light shone on them. This movie helps give me hope that I'm just being paranoid.To read more of my reviews: http://yaykisspurr.wordpress.com/",Working Girl

The performances are all terrific, the chemistry between Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford is very very sexy, Sigourney Weaver is very very funny as the villain, and every single one of the supporting roles ( Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack, Philip Bosco, to name a few) are perfectly cast and performed to perfection. In addition, the writing is funny brisk and sharp and Nichols' direction is the same.Although a light comedy, it captures perfectly the essence of the corporate New York office culture in the early to late 90s.

It is perfect for a ""girls night"" movie and would recommend it highly! ""Let the River Run"" by Carly Simon still gives me chills when I hear it when I think of Tess McGill (Griffith) climbing the corporate ladder. It isn't just that, she improves her whole life, including getting rid of her cheating boyfriend (Alec Baldwin!). Joan Cusack is hilarious as always with a few lines that make me laugh every time...""coffee, tea....ME?"". Sigourney Weaver is good as the ""bad guy"", and Harrison Ford fits the role of manly eye candy rather than good acting. (The part where he changes his shirt in the office, ladies??)

115,rferentz,One of the best romantic comedies of the '80s,10,22 March 2009,"If this isn't the best, WORKING GIRL is surely one of the very best romantic comedies of the 1980s. It's a classic. From the fantastic opening sequence starting with The Statue of Liberty and Carly Simon's Oscar-winning song you are swept-up into the world of Tess McGill and all of the characters in her life.Harrison Ford has never been better in a role the may be over-powered by his show-stopping female counterparts. Sigourney Weaver is hilarious as the boss without a soul. Joan Cusack is unforgettable as Tess' big-haired girlfriend and all of the other characters are perfectly cast down to the smallest role, but the revelation here is Melanie Griffith.Miss Griffith IS Tess McGill. Even twenty years later, I don't see how anyone can say this wasn't the performance of the year. While all of the actors are excellent in their roles, it's Griffith's Tess which holds the entire movie together. It was a star-making performance, and in my humble opinion, she richly deserved the Academy Award for which she was nominated.Mike Nichols has created a movie that anyone can watch over and over again and never be bored. It's completely charming and captivating. It's the perfect movie to watch when you need a pick-me-up. See for yourself, and enjoy!",Working Girl
116,jtarnopolski,Good movie... despite Griffith.,8,19 August 2020,"Griffith's stint on the A-list was shortlived. Her 'babydoll' voice is actually not enduring at all. I found myself, at times, struggling to get passed it but the story of Working Girl makes it livable, as well as the outstanding supporting cast. Sigourney Weaver plays the dragon lady boss to a tee. It's actually a shame that she didn't win, she should've. I think Cusack's nomination probably hurt her and likely split the vote, allowing Davis to sweep in and unexpectedly take the Oscar out of her hands. It's also quite refreshing to see Harrison Ford in a non-typical Harrison Ford role.Despite Griffith, the movie is very good. Was it worthy of all the oscar nominations it received? I think it was the Academy trying to show that they were somehow being progressive by taking a girl-power movie and heaping accolades on it. Typcially the Academy is 10 years behind on the times. Progressiveness is not what the Academy is known for. That being said, it is an enjoyable movie with a great come-uppance at the end that will make you smile.",Working Girl

For me, though, it's a solid 9. When I add to the above the substance and message of this movie, it becomes an underrated sleeper. Yes, the message is stylishly delivered in ""feel good"" format. I like that from time to time... sort of like Hoosiers. But like Hoosiers, I'm left with so much more than feeling good, I'm moved. Nicely layered without being too complex, it portrays one of our society's most overlooked problems, even nearly two decades later... how to take smart people seriously when they aren't already ""connected"" through conventional means. Harrison Ford delivers his predictably superb performance, but Melanie Griffith has been too often under-appreciated when she has in fact delivered an excellent performance. She does so here, as she does in ""Shining Through"" (1992). Here, her ""gumption"" and unassuming, all-I-want-is-a-fair-chance ethic is one worthy of her being the role model for many a ""Working Girl""! Carley Simon's Oscar-winning theme is similarly a worthy bonus. Thank you, Mike Nichols and team.",Working Girl

Melanie Griffith plays Tess McGill, an ambitious secretary who dreams of becoming a 'someone'.  Her chance comes when she thinks up a brilliant idea and puts it forward to boss Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) who steals the idea and tries to take all the credit.  Tess finds this out when Katherine is off on holiday and decides to do something about it -- conjure up a way to get the idea to the 'big boys' before Katherine does (and steal the heart of Katherine's main man, Jack Trainer {played by Harrison Ford})Kevin Wade's screenplay gives plenty of funny one-liners and situations and the female leads, (Griffith, Weaver and Joan Cusack) are brilliant.  In fact, the films' main problems are that of the presence of Ford and Alec Baldwin as Griffith's snaky boyfriend.Not bad for an 80's film, if not for the Carly Simon song, the delightful performance of Joan Cusack as a 'dance-in-the-mirror-type' secretary.

The wonderful Sigourney Weaver (who should have got the Oscar for her performance) shows the best of her in one of the most sparkling performance I've seen for a supporting actress. Melanie Griffith did the best role of her career and Harrison Ford showed he also could be a really funny actor.

123,jahannah,Insipid crud . . . I expect more out of Mike Nichols,4,6 March 2005,"I just saw this movie again today after seeing it the theater years ago and became so angry that I had to write. Insipid doesn't begin to describe the plot or the acting. Uninspired, flat, affectless, bland, these are all adjectives that lack the punch necessary to give this movie its just due.Melanie Griffith stars as a secretary cum executive who mixes work and pleasure on her ""women-empowerment"" rise to the top. Melanie looks puffy and out of her element here in the grrlll-power role. Maybe that's because she got most of her roles on her looks and by riding on the back of her mother's career. I guess the moral of this story is: hang out on enough movie sets with a famous mom and receive an acting career of your own. If I had only known...Harrison Ford puts in a workmanlike performance as the business executive charmed by Melanie's character and her go-getter, feminist attitude. Alec Baldwin has a small role as Melanie's scumbag boyfriend/fiancée. David Duchovny and Ricki Lake also have bit roles.All in all, I would expect better out of Mike Nichols, who gave us The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and even such original films as Catch-22. This movie can't decide if it wants to be feminist propaganda or a romantic comedy, and the result is a mess. I guess this is what we get when someone with Nichols' talent is paired up with the writer who gave us such gems as Maid in Manhattan, Junior, and Meet Joe Black. Don't avoid this movie so much as give it a wide berth.",Working Girl

Tess McGill played by Melanie Griffith is trying to make her way out of her secretary role and into the business world. But en route to her dreams her boss Katherine Parker played by Sigourney Weaver steals her idea and takes full credit for the work. But in an ironic twist of fate Tess falls for Jack Trainer played by Harrison Ford, who is not only a prominent player in the business world but also Katherine's boy friend. The theme is that of Jack and Tess falling in love while trying to get by the evil boss Katherine to push through Tess's idea to the owners of the company. There are many pitfalls for these two young business people to overcome. The love they must hide after they realize they are in love with each other all while trying to push Tess to the top of the business game while trying to prove the ideas Katherine is presenting are actually ideas that Tess had come up with.Lighting and color are used extensively to set the scene of the movie. While Tess is just a secretary she is dressed in bright colors and her hair is brighter along with the lighting is brighter. When Tess is clad in her business attire the tones and lighting are more netural earth tones. In one scene Tess and Jack become lovers the lighting is low and seductive alone with the dress of Tess to help set the tone of the scene and also to get the audiences imagination flowing. The use of lighting and color are used heavily in this movie in a very smart and imaginative way to bring you into the scene, you actually feel like part of the movie.Overall this is a very well written and directed romantic comedy. The cast of Melanie Griffith as Tess McGill, Harrison Ford as Jack Trainer and Sigourney Weaver as Katherine Parker was a brilliant cast.

127,shawnmcclain09,Melanie Griffith is a true Working Girl!,8,15 March 2010,"Working Girl has a very universal theme that I feel anyone can relate too. The movie stars Harrison Ford as Jack Trainer, Sigourney Weaver as Katherine Parker, and Melanie Griffith as the ""Working Girl"" Tess McGill. Joan Cusak co-stars as Cyn, Tess McGill's best friend.Tess McGill (Griffith) is an upcoming working gal. She works for a temp service and has already had three jobs prior to working for Katherine Parker. As Tess begins her new job she is very ambitious and eager to work for Katherine. Katherine has promised that she listens to new ideas and that she works as if everything is a two way street. However, after Tess comes up with a brilliant idea for the company, she quickly learns that Katherine isn't as nice as she seems to appear.So after Katherine has an unfortunate accident, Tess takes on the task of selling her idea to Jack Trainer and gets the ball rolling on her idea. This movie is universal in appeal to everyone, because I feel that at some point in time in our lives we have had the boss that will use our own ideas as their own and take credit for something they haven't done.The director did a wonderful job capturing the true essence in Tess McGill. One scene that I remember where the director showcased the true nature of Tess McGill was when she was escorting Jack to the elevator and turning him down on his proposal to go out with him. I really like the angle of the camera that was used to capture McGill's (Griffith) innocent and sweet facial reaction as the door closed on the elevator.I also liked how the director used different scene elements to showcase feelings in the movie. There is one scene where Tess is getting hit on in the back seat of a limo. It isn't bad enough that she is getting sexually assaulted but as she gets out of the limo it is rainy and dreary and she gets splattered with water from cars that are passing by.It is scenes like this that truly make a movie more believable, and that is just what happens in Working Girl. The acting is on par for this type of movie and helps the viewer feel as if they can identify more with the film and that it isn't something that is over the top and couldn't happen in real life.Overall I think Working Girl is a movie that can hold its own over the years and was a true gem for Melanie Griffith. Her performance here is universal and makes anyone believe that if they believe in themselves they too can be Tess McGill",Working Girl

Tess finds that it's a difficult journey to travel, with lots of road blocks, pot-holes, and bad directions. She has been in and out of several firms, because she has trouble working for her male bosses that treat her like a piece of meat. After leaving yet another firm, she goes to work for a female boss, Katherine Parker—played by Sigourney Weaver, that is condescending, catty, and ultimately steals her brokerage ideas.When Tess finds out that Katherine stole her idea, she decides that she's going to act like the boss and carry-on with the deal, while Katherine is out of town. Tess begins working out her plans, professionally and romantically with Jack Trainor, played by Harrison Ford. Things go good until Jack's girlfriend and Tess' boss, Katherine, returns from her trip to find that the business has been moving forward without her.Things really hit the fan at this point and Katherine exposes Tess for who she really is in front of all the top people involved in Tess' business deal. Tess leaves and begins to pack her things when Jack and the other business men want the truth from both Tess and Katherine. When Katherine isn't able to produce the truth, she's fired and Tess gets hired and promoted to a dream position.Tess worked hard and never gave up hope on her dreams even when she was working for male-chauvinistic pigs and a jealous witch. Nine to Five is another movie with much of the same theme, featuring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton. It came out eight years earlier than Working Girl. The women in each of the movies decided to take things into their own hands and do what had to be done to set things right and move to the top.One of the techniques used in Working Girl was the use of its music to emphasize the emotion that's going on with the actors, especially Tess. From the opening credits, singer Carly Simon sings her song ""Let the River Run."" It is a very moving song that gives the listener a feeling of strength, hope, and empowerment. Throughout the movie the viewer watches Tess travel the ups and downs of her journey and feels the pain that she does. Whenever Tess, seems to be on the road back up, the instrumental soundtrack version of ""Let the River Run,"" plays. This effectively gives the viewer the same feeling that Tess feels—strength to carry on and achieve the goal of getting to the top.Another technique that was used was fast motion. Fast motion was used in one of the sequences in which Tess is riding the ferry, looking toward the World Trade Center. The speed of the film was sped up to shorten the time span of the ferry ride and transition into the next scene.Working Girl is a fun movie to watch especially since it was filmed in the '80s. It'll take you back to the days of big hair, funky clothes, and wild make-up. The best thing though is being able to see the underdog come out on top. Working Girl will keep you cheering Tess on; from the opening credits, to the very end.",Working Girl

To find out the truth about the merger, Oren Trask asked Katherine how did she get the idea about the merger and she could not answer.

131,rsmith-52,Mike Nichols returns--nearly--to the heights the attained with The Graduate,9,16 September 2005,"For anyone who worked and lived in Manhattan in the 1980's, Working Girl is a tour de force about that time and place. From the infamous 'big hair' worn by Joan Cusack, who was absolutely fantastic and deserved the Oscar, to the pompous, greedy and decadent denizens of the Wall Street investment banking culture, the movie skewers so much so well. Though it does not attain the status of visual equivalence with Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities--what could--Working Girl does poke great fun and nail not only the culture, trends, and fashion from the 'Decade of Greed' but even the caricatures of such.One of the few criticisms of the movie that I've read concerned the casting of Harrison Ford as the investment banker. Though he wasn't as bad as some opined--he brought a certain teddy bear-ish charm to the character--he was miscast. He didn't hurt the movie but he would have been the last person I would have tested for the role. He did some strange thing with his accent that too often had me wondering if it was an affectation he brought to the character or a canker sore he was suffering from at the time. In either case, it was distracting and, if a choice, didn't work.The movie needs to be seen and Joan Cusack alone makes it worth the ride.",Working Girl
132,amandanordgren,A must-see classic from a time before we knew hairspray could damage the Ozone layer.,9,8 September 2005,"A film about Tess (Melanie Griffiths) leaving her cheating Baldwin-brother boyfriend in New Jersey and climbing up the work-ladder in the Big Apple. She cuts her big 1980s hair off and gets herself a good job. She discovers her worth with a little help from her mentor Sigourney Weaver and takes control of her life, finding love on the way in goofy and confused Harrison Ford.Fantastic Joan Cusack, who plays Griffiths best friend, has never been better. With a line like ""Sometimes I walk around in my underwear, it doesn't make me Madonna."" and because she keeps her, even bigger, 1980s haircut she can't go wrong. Griffiths is not bad herself with the fabulous line ""Im not beef, you can't just order me!"". This is Hollywood at its feminist best and every minute of it is empowering feel-good watching.",Working Girl
