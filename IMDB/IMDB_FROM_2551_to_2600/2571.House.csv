0,SnoopyStyle,terrific well made haunted house movie,8,26 March 2015,"Vietnam vet and successful horror writer Roger Cobb (William Katt) is quietly suffering after his son Jimmy's mysterious disappearance in the swimming pool. The case is cold and the police avoids him. In turn, he avoids his loving actress ex-wife Sandy Sinclair (Kay Lenz). It's 3 years since his big book and he plans to write about his Vietnam experiences. He is haunted by the war and his buddy Big Ben (Richard Moll). He moves into her aunt's home after she hangs herself. She had raised him after his mother's death. She claimed that the house is responsible for Jimmy's disappearance. Harold Gorton (George Wendt) is his nosy next door neighbor and his biggest fan.Coming off Friday the 13th Parts 2 and 3, director Steve Miner makes a well constructed haunted house movie. This is probably my favorite of his full length features. It's not groundbreaking but there is something about William Katt's performance as a haunted dad that is so compelling. It has a few scares but it is more about rooting for Roger. It's one of those lesser known horrors that really strikes a cord with me.",House
1,claudio_carvalho,The Frightening House,8,22 March 2018,"The successful writer Roger Cobb (William Katt) is trying to write a book about his experience in Vietnam, but he is blocked after the disappearance of his son Jimmy and the divorce from his wife, the actress Sandy Sinclair (Kay Lenz). When his beloved Aunt Elizabeth (Susan French) is found dead hanged in her bedroom, Roger inherits the house and moves to live there. His snoopy neighbor and fan Harold Gorton (George Wendt) gets close to Roger and learns that his aunt claimed that the house is haunted. Further Jimmy disappeared in the swimming pool on the back of the house. While writing his memories from the Vietnam when his pal Big Ben (Richard Moll) was captured and tortured by the Vietcong, weird things happen in the house and soon Roger leans that the place is a gateway to a hellish dimension. ""House"" is one of the best haunted house films ever made. The plot is funny and recalls ""Twilight Zone"", with surrealistic situations. William Katt is great in the role of the writer that wants solitude but finds monsters while haunted by his past. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""House - A Casa do Espanto"" (""House - The Frightening House"")",House
2,nogodnomasters,You Can Normally Tell How Great a B-Horror is by,10,7 May 2019,"You Can Normally Tell How Great a B-Horror is by...the creation of a sequel. House is no exception. As a comedy-horror, ""House"" broke ground in the 1980s to set the bar higher for B movies. This was a must see B-horror when it came out. It is still good by today's standards, having stood the test of time.Good rock-n-roll sound track too. George Wendt as the quirky neighbor is classic, and William Katt, a very B actor, is perhaps in his finest performance (where's the Academy?). The baby sitting scene was one that I enjoyed as he tells the 3 year old, ""How would you like to play with a nice plastic bag?"" It is a must for any B horror movie collection. Notice the shadow of the boom mic in the closet? In fact IMDb lists over 2 dozen such goofs for this movie.Could make for a good drinking party to list all the goofs and then point them out as the movie progresses.",House
3,kosmasp,Who's house?,8,5 August 2020,"In that case most definitely not Runs house! Old school rap references aside, the movie is as fun and old school 80s as a movie can get. Now there is blood, there is violence (they really wanted the R rating as a sign of showing viewers they are horror, a badge of honor sort of), but there is also a lot of humor. A mixture that I have learned quite a few people are not really fond of.Being aware of that (if you weren't or hadn't seen the movie before), should give you a sense if this is something you want to pursue, watch and enjoy. Now while that can be a topic of discussion, if you like horror and are not squeamish, there is no doubt about the poster or cover art for this ... amazing! I almost wish they had spent more time on that in the massive extras on the blu ray extras I watched. Generally also giving you a fantastic insight to the making of and to the history of the films (and the abuse Kane Hodder took to make these happen - yes he's a glutton for punishment). Really fun, really light but also dark in some instances this was rightfully sucessful and spawned many sequels (which almost begs the question why there isn't or wasn't a part 5?) ...",House
4,gavin6942,"When ""Cheers"" and ""Night Court"" Combine in the World of Terror",7,6 February 2007,"After an old woman is found hung in her creepy old house, her nephew (writer Roger Cobb, played by William Katt) decides to move in for some solitude. But the memories of the house come back to him, as this was where he lost his son and his marriage began to fall apart. And what is up with all the demons hiding in the closet? The genesis of the film is somewhat interesting. Screenwriter Ethan Wiley was referred to the creators by Fred Dekker, who had developed the original concept. Dekker was too busy developing a Godzilla film for Steve Miner, so he passed the idea to Wiley, who converted it into more of a comedy. Now, the Godzilla film ended up in development hell, but the positive outcome is a superior ""House"". Dekker's version would have been darker, focused more on PTSD, while Wiley's version is what makes it so enduring.Although my favorite film in the ""House"" series is part two, the entire run was respectable. We have some of the better acting for horror films of the time, and an interesting and original plot. The biggest flaw really is the poor makeup effects (especially on Big Ben), but this may have been partially intentional to reinforce that it is less than serious. The Vietnam theme is also played up a bit too much, but that was the kernel of the story, so it would be hard to remove.Richard Moll (Bull Shannon from ""Night Court"") appears as Big Ben, a Vietnam soldier captured by the Vietnamese. His role is very important, although the acting comes across as flat. I do not know if he is a poor actor or if the script simply did not give him much room to work, but the entire Ben subplot is a bit lacking.At the same time, we have George Wendt (Norm from ""Cheers"") as a friendly neighbor who has no problem inviting himself in for some pizza and beer. Wendt is wonderful and really makes this film fun, just as he would do twenty years later in John Landis' ""Family"". He also starts the trend of ""Cheers"" actors in the ""House"" series (John Ratzenberger appears in part two).The film is fun, and a good pace. Nothing very scary here, not even the closet that goes straight to what looks like Cthulhu's basement. But sometimes you do not need scares and scantily-clad women. Sometimes you need a little fun, and you will find it here (and even more in ""House II""). Watch it. You will like it.Arrow Video has released the definitive ""House"" set (either two films or more depending on your region). For the first film, we not only get an extremely informative audio commentary from Steve Miner, Sean Cunningham, William Katt and Ethan Wiley, but we have a brand new making-of documentary which has all of those names plus George Wendt, Fred Dekker, Harry Manfredini and more. This is the last word on ""House"".",House
5,Tweekums,Fun eighties comedy horror,7,6 November 2012,"When horror writer Roger Cobb's aunt commits suicide he inherits her house and moves in. She was convinced that the house was haunted and he is still haunted by the disappearance of his son that that very house! He hasn't been there long before strange things start to happen; he is attacked by a strange creature in the closet and when his ex turns up she suddenly turns into a ghoulish creature! There is certainly something peculiar about the house; it isn't just the strange creatures that appear at certain times there appear to be portals through which he can pass to somewhere entirely different; sometimes a dark, bottomless void, other times to the jungles of Vietnam where he once served. It is the latter that provides the films main antagonist; Big Ben; a fellow soldier who has returned from the dead to take his revenge on Roger for something that happened during the war. As well as dealing with the terrors in his house Roger must deal with a neighbour who keeps disturbing him and babysit a child in the house that has already taken his son.This film is a lot of fun; there are a few scares and plenty of laughs. William Katt does a decent job as protagonist Cobb and George Wendt is amusing as his annoying neighbour Harold. The effects are pretty good for what was never going to be a major film; I especially liked back-from-the-dead Ben... a character that managed to be both menacing and funny. The story is fairly basic but that doesn't matter as there is always something happening. This may seem dated to modern audiences but I liked the fact that the effects were 'real' rather than CGI and the lack of gore and anything really nasty means it can be enjoyed by younger teens... it was given a '15' certificate by the BBFC but I suspect it would only get a '12' if it were certificated today; it is certainly at the tamer end of the '15' certificate. I'd say this is definitely worth watching; especially if you are a fan of '80s horror.",House
6,BA_Harrison,Creaky doors and structural flaws: this House is a fix-me-upper,5,15 December 2008,"William Katt plays down-on-his-luck horror novelist Roger Cobb, whose marriage and career have hit the skids since the mysterious disappearance of his son. In an effort to turn his life around, Roger decides to write a new book based on his war experiences in Vietnam, but after moving into his late Aunt's creepy old house for a bit of solitude, he discovers that his past is finally about to catch up with him.Written by Fred Dekker, produced and directed by Friday the 13th's Sean S. Cunningham and Steve Miner, scored by Harry Manfredini, and photographed by Mac Ahlberg, House is built on some sturdy horror foundations, and it's easy to understand how planning permission for this venture was initially secured.Had I been the man in charge of overseeing the project, however, construction wouldn't have gone ahead until some major flaws in the blueprints had been addressed: flaws that cause the film to creak at the joints and ultimately come crashing down in a mess of unresolved plot threads, half-baked ideas, and silly slapstick comedy.The problem is not in the quality of the raw materials used, for they are the dependable components that have been tried and tested in many a spooky house movie: creepy passageways, dusty rooms, spooky sounds, and mysterious happenings. No, the problem is with how these elements are assembled, with slipshod construction, lack of attention to detail, and the papering over of some pretty hefty cracks all going to make House a rather unsound development.It's a shame, because the basic premise has loads of potential and there are certain features that are very desirable (the sexy blonde neighbour in the bikini, for one!).Director Miner is no slouch when it comes to delivering chills and atmosphere, and offers a fun array of lighthearted frights and no end of creepy scenes guaranteed to keep viewers on tenterhooks. Unfortunately, it is Dekker's muddled story and the ill advised use of comedy that prove to be the film's weak points. The narrative makes very little sense, with no satisfactory explanation given for the property's supernatural occurrences and its malevolent inhabitants, and the result is a film that exists purely to deliver a series of well-executed scares.A silly ending, in which Roger's zombiefied Vietnam buddy Ben is revealed to be responsible for the disappearance of the writer's son, is poorly handled, leaving one with the sneaking suspicion that the makers didn't really care too much that the story made no sense, just so long as they managed to squeeze in a few silly monsters along the way.Reading other comments here on IMDb, I see that some people view this film as a psychological horror, with the strange events being Roger's way of subconsciously handling the horrors he experienced in Vietnam. Personally, I don't think the film is trying to be that clever, and if it is, it isn't trying hard enough.",House
7,paul_haakonsen,Where was the comedy?...,4,15 December 2015,"I have seen this movie once when I was much younger, but only remember the zombie soldier of the entire movie. So the movie wasn't particularly memorable for me. And having seen it again I can say that there was indeed a reason for it not being memorable.The story in this mid-eighties horror comedy was plain and really had nothing overly impressive to offer. It wasn't scary as all at any time during the length of the movie, nor did it have any funny moments that will make you laugh.It should be said that that effects in ""House"" were actually quite alright and were the best part of the movie. And the acting was also adequate, which made it bearable to sit through the movie.While I said that the movie wasn't memorable, I do stand corrected in terms of Richard Moll as a zombie was just priceless, and that George Wendt actually made something outside of the ""Cheers"" bar was a feat in itself.Not a particularly impressive movie, so the enthusiasm to Watch the three other movies in the series is not really peaking.",House
8,BandSAboutMovies,A good example of 80's horror,6,11 February 2018,"Steve Miner has so many cinematic sins to deal with - Soul Man, My Father the Hero, Big Bully (the next to last live action film Rick Moranis would appear in), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later - that you almost forget that he started his career making the second and third installments of Friday the 13th and today's movie, House.Roger Cobb (William Katt, Carrie) has some issues. As a Stephen King-ian popular horror writer, he feels fenced in by the horror genre. He has writer's block. His wife has left him. His son disappeared and no one can find him. And the aunt that raised him just hung herself in the haunted house where he was raised.Cobb intends his next book to be about what he went through in Vietnam, so he decides to move into the house. His strongest memories involve Big Ben (Richard Moll, fulfilling the contract that either he or Robert Englund appear in every 80's horror film), a soldier who bullied him back in 'Nam who was injured and left behind for the enemy to capture.Everyone's a fan of Cobb, from his new neighbor Harold (George Wendt from TV's Cheers) to his real estate agent and the cops that investigate him. He just wants to write. But with all the monsters in his head - and real monsters in the house - that doesn't seem like it's going to happen.Things get worse when his wife visits and turns into a monster, only to be killed by a shotgun blast. At this point, the film flirts with making Cobb the real monster, but it's a narrative shift that is never followed up on. Then, as he buries his wife, his hot neighbor comes on to him. What he thinks will be a night of hot sex turns out to be him watching her young son, but that goes wrong when little monsters try to steal the kid,Finally, Cobb falls into his medicine cabinet into an alternate dimension that predates the Upside Down of Stranger Things by several decades. He rescues his son, but not before Big Ben attacks him again. Finally, Cobb realizes that all of his fears are inside his head and he destroys the monster with a grenade before leading the house to find his son and wife, who is magically returned to life.House was produced by Sean S. Cunningham and featured music by Henry Manfredini, who also worked on the Friday the 13th films. Fred Dekker wrote the original script, but most of the humor is credited to Ethan Wiley.This is a good example of pre-CGI monster moviemaking. Big Ben looks great, a triumph of practical makeup, as do the creatures that populate the film. And it's interesting that this movie explores PTSD and the dark side of war years before many were ready to face it.The look of the film reminds me of late-period Fulci minus the gore. I'm referring to the film stock itself, which doesn't have much richness, looking more like a TV movie than a theatrical film.House isn't a movie that demands that you watch it, but if you're looking for something in the middle of the night, it always provides a fun distraction. You can't dislike a film that has a large fish on the wall come to life and try to kill someone.",House
9,Coventry,"Well, this isn't good at all !",4,23 June 2003,"I picked up this film after I got a lot of recommendations on it. Not just here on this wonderful website but also from magazines, friends etc. I was told this is one the typical 80's horror films. Creepy and funny at the same time. Well, the 80's was an excellent decade for the genre, but this film sure doesn't belong in the list of the best. It can't compete to The Evil Dead, Re-Animator or even the Night of the Creeps (although this last film and House have the same scriptwriter. Fred Dekker proved he was able to pull it off with Night of the Creeps but not with this one). I don't know what the main problem with this film is. I think it is very slooooooooooooooow. The story never seems to develop, actually. I did start great though. A big creepy house owned by a weird old lady. She's found hung up. Looked like she couldn't handle the haunted house anymore. Then her nephew moves in. He's a writer of horror stories who lived there before, but his son strangely disappeared and that cost him both his career and his marriage. He wants 'solitude' to work on his new book now ( about his Vietnam experiences - that's a rather important detail to the movie ) and therefore he moved in to his aunt's house. Well, as you probably could have guessed, strange things happen. Ghosts are dwelling around and are trying to drive him crazy. Like I said, it started out nice. After the guy just moved in he gets to meet his neighbor. And it's NORM PETERSON ! The greatest character from the wonderful sitcom CHEERS. My first thought was : OK, if they want to make a horror-comedy, this guy is the best choice to pull it off. Well, he is the best character in the movie indeed, but his part can't save the movie completely. Neither can the part of the great looking neighbor. A standard woman from the 80's but very pretty...his ex-wife too, by the way. Final conclusion : way to slow to keep interested, the script contains many small faults ( **SPOILER** How could for example the Big Ben zombie know for sure that the guy would move in to the house **END SPOILER**) The acting is OK, I guess and so is are the make-up effects. The story is the biggest disappointment. Too bad that is the most important factor of a movie...at least in my opinion. The film got three sequels which I also bought. They were in a box for 14.99$. I already regret wasting my money :(",House
10,Hey_Sweden,"Ding, dong, you're dead.",7,25 December 2012,"Fairly funny horror comedy gets by on sheer likability. It never gets too intense while remaining somewhat imaginative and offbeat. It's written by Ethan Wiley, based on a story by Fred Dekker (""Night of the Creeps"", ""The Monster Squad""), and produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham and Steve Miner respectively, the first two directors in the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. William Katt ('The Greatest American Hero', ""Carrie"") stars as Roger Cobb, a horror novelist who's going through a bunch of problems: his son has vanished, his wife has divorced him, he's suffering from haunting Vietnam flashbacks, and his dotty old Aunt Elizabeth (Susan French) has recently hung herself. Seeking some all-important solitude, he moves into Elizabeths' Victorian home and is soon harassed by various demons. That off the wall sensibility helps to keep this movie from being purely predictable, and there are various rubber monsters that Roger will have to deal with - a closet monster which he tries to photograph, a cackling witch, and two little imps. The special effects are quite engaging in their low-tech simplicity (it's cool to see a monster that's rather reminiscent of the Deadites in Sam Raimis' ""Evil Dead"" series), and that really is one hell of a nice house to serve as the main location in this thing. It's shot from a number of angles, and there's even a pool in the back. The production design and cinematography are by the late professionals Gregg Fonseca and Mac Ahlberg, and Harry Manfredini supplies a score that occasionally sounds familiar to ""Friday the 13th"" series fans but which overall is good. The cast is fun to watch, with Katt making for a relatable hero, as he tries to come to grips with what he's seeing. The stunt casting of sitcom stars George Wendt (as the solicitous neighbour) and Richard Moll (as Rogers' flamboyant Vietnam comrade) works wonders and both actors are very amusing. There's also luscious eye candy in the form of Kay Lenz, as Rogers' concerned ex-wife, and Mary Stavin, as another neighbour, with a number of familiar faces in the character roles - Michael Ensign, Alan Autry, Steven Williams, Mindy Sterling, Steve Susskind, Dwier Brown, Stephen Nichols, and Ronn Carroll. They all help to make ""House"" pleasant if not great viewing. It might not have all viewers necessarily laughing out loud, but it's sure to make people smile. Followed by three sequels. Seven out of 10.",House
11,Doylenf,Struggles to mix black comedy with horror for mixed results...,5,21 October 2006,"WILLIAM KATT suffers from the sudden death of a suicidal aunt, the disappearance of his son, the end of a marriage and nightmarish Vietnam memories--and this is all before he moves into the HOUSE. Of course, he should have known better than to try to settle down to some quiet writing of a novel about Vietnam in the very house that his aunt resided in before her demise.No surprise that he then begins to experience all sorts of what appear to be hallucinatory fantasies caused by his traumatic experiences in the war. This would all make sense if the film followed a logical flow of events--but none of what happens in the house is even remotely believable. In other words, if you want logic with your horror, you won't find it here.KATT has an appealing screen presence (he's the son of Barbara Hale and Bill Williams) and looks strikingly like his father. He handles his role well, keeping a serious face throughout all the implausible situations. GEORGE WENDT (from ""Cheers"") is his inquisitive next-door neighbor.It's moderately entertaining although it does take time for the horror aspects to take over. Not really deserving of an even less appealing sequel that came out a few years later.",House
12,poolandrews,A really enjoyable mix of light horror & comedy that works quite well.,7,3 April 2005,"House starts with an elaborate shot of a large Californian mansion, the camera starts around back and in one continuous free flowing shot circles the house eventually resting on a delivery boy (James Calvert as Jimmy Calvert) pulling up outside on his moped. He walks up to the front door and as he knocks it opens. He calls out to the owner Mrs. Elizabeth Hooper (Susan French), he says he will leave the groceries on the table but still does not get an answer. He feels uneasy & starts to look around the house. After going upstairs he finds Elizabeth dead, seemingly having committed suicide by hanging herself. Elizabeth's nephew Roger Cobb (William Katt) is a Vietnam Vet, successful novelist who is currently struggling to write his new book about his experiences in Vietnam & is recently divorced from television actress Sandy Sinclaire (Kay Lenz) after their young son Jimmy (Erik & Mark Silver, identical twins maybe?) had disappeared without a trace while at the house. Roger decides to stay in his Aunt's old house to get away from things & concentrate on his novel. Almost immediately strange & bizarre occurrences start to happen, Roger sees the ghost of his Aunt who warns him to leave & when he opens a closet is attacked by a slimy monster. Things become worse as Roger is attacked by flying garden tools & fat ugly monsters, Roger starts to investigate the house & becomes convinced that the answer to finding his lost son lies within if he manages to survive! Directed by Steve Miner I thought House was an entertaining & modest little comedy horror. The script by Ethan Wiley based on a story by Fred Dekker mixes the horror & dark humour quite well, it keeps the film moving along at a nice pace although one or two sections dragged a little. Things aren't tied up that well though, the haunted house goings-on are not explained at all, was it just Ben using the house as revenge or is the house really haunted? And what connection does Ben have to the house in the first place? House isn't a sadistic film in terms of violence & gore but there is some here & a few fun looking monsters, I especially liked the fat female creature in her pink dress & Big Ben's (Richard Moll) rotting zombie make-up is reasonably impressive & he makes for a cool bad guy. William Katt makes for a likable hero & George Wendt's nosey neighbour Harold Gorton is very funny even though he isn't in the film that much. None of the other characters are developed that much. Technically the film is OK, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either except the Vietnam flashback sequences that were obviously shot in a cheap looking studio set. The special effects, while their a little cheesy & aren't exactly going to impress anyone too much these days are watchable enough. Overall I liked House's fun mix of horror & comedy, it's a decent enough way to pass an hour and a half & you could do a lot worse. Definitely worth a watch.",House
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Ding dong, you're dead."" ""What? No, I just dose off. Do me a favor and wake me up when the film is over.""",5,14 February 2005,"My friend and I sat down to watch this horror-comedy, hoping for something decent but expecting some awful. We were surprised, but I'm not sure if it was pleasantly so. What we got was something in-between the two aforementioned groups of expectation. It is horrible, sorry, I mean, it does contain horror, but most of it doesn't work. It does contain comedy, but it's usually funny for all the wrong reasons. The horror is usually built up too much or not enough, and the scares mostly inspire laughter rather than fear or the occasional jump in your seat. The score is marred by some truly dreadful 80's pop and a few overdone shock pieces. The plot is kind of dumb, but I guess it's supposed to be. The pacing is bad. Just bad. No other way to put it. Often it looks like the camera-crew or whoever edited this mess together was asleep at the wheel. The acting is mostly uninspired and dull. The characters are paper-thin and underdeveloped. The humor is lame. The gags and jokes, or rather, the few of them that are intentional, mostly just aren't funny. We tried laughing, we really did, but we found ourselves laughing at all the stuff that was supposed to be scary and simply cringe whenever the film threw a misplaced, mistimed and poorly done joke or gag in our face. By now, the special effects are ridiculous, especially the stop-motion stuff. Now, for the positive stuff; the film is reasonably creative, and when it does get going, about thirty minutes in, it is somewhat entertaining, even if it is for all the wrong reasons. As far as 80's flicks go, it's not the worst out there. There's reasonably little unnecessary stuff in the film, most of what you see is there either to scare you or make you laugh. The fact that it usually fails to do either need not be mentioned again. Overall, a decent enough 80's horror-comedy. I recommend this to fans of 80's flicks and movie fanatics(who'll surely get a kick out of it). 5/10",House
14,neil-476,Ha ha! Aaargh!,7,14 April 2011,"When horror and comedy work well together, the result is something to be treasured. House is a case in point.Writer Roger is left a house by his aunt: it turns out that the house has all sorts of nasties in store for him. Factor in the fact that he has neighbours to consider (in more ways than several), and you have the basic scenario.There are some nice effects here - not too scary, and often amusing - together with William Katt's Roger, who is more alarmed and bemused than scared.This movie is genuinely funny, makes you jump sometimes, and has many horror trappings without ever being horrific. This entertaining movie is highly enjoyable.",House
15,Aaron1375,A horror comedy from 1985 that delivers,8,12 April 2001,"I always enjoyed this horror/comedy when I was a kid and upon viewing it again, I still enjoy it. The film just clicks for me and there is a lot going on in this one. I watched two other horror films recently, and more happened in this film than happened in those two films combined. Not saying they were bad as one was a horror film from the 70's and there are a lot them that are slow burn and rely on a last disturbing scene to make the film. The other one was kind of bad as it was a monster film that did not feature the monsters much as all. This one shows us monsters, has flying tools that want to chop you up and has a Vietnam vet returning from the grave! It also stars a lot of actors that were more known for their roles in television rather than film as it has William Katt known for, The Greatest American Hero, George Wendt from Cheers and Richard Moll from Night Court. The comedy is pretty good, but they still keep quite a bit of horror in this one too. The second film in the series would rely a bit more on comedy and action rather than horror.The story has a man named Roger Cobb who is a writer. He has been having trouble writing since his son turned up missing one day. His aunt kills herself in the home where the boy seemingly disappeared in the pool and Roger soon moves into the old house. He meets his neighbor who is a fan of Roger's and everything proceeds normally enough...for a couple of minutes anyway! Soon Roger is being assailed by hellish creatures in the closet of his aunt's room, being attacked by the tools in his shed, sees his ex-wife turn into a grotesque monster and has to deal with many other things in the house full of craziness. All through the movie he also tries to write his latest novel which is a true story about his time in Vietnam. He also has to babysit a kid he doesn't even know and he and Harold (the neighbor) try to fight off the 'racoon' in the closet.This film would spawn a sequel that would feature John Ratzenberger in a small role, so this one featured Norm and then the next Cliff. There is no true part three to the series as they named a completely unrelated film named, ""The Horror Show"" the title House III for its non U.S.A release, but here instead of naming the next actual House film, part III they went straight to IV. That film would not be a success, but if you have seen it you can easily see why as it has none of the charm of this film or second film and was just horrifically bad! This was the best of the House films I have seen. Never saw the not really a House film, Horror Show, but considering it was not really meant to be a House film I guess it really does not count. Though I am interested in seeing it if they ever release the full version of it. Apparently, its initial cut was so gruesome it garnered an X rating! This one could almost be PG-13 as there really is not too much gore in it, no nudity and minimal cussing. Still, it was a very fun horror film to watch. I loved the whole strangeness of the House, as there are monsters in it and strange portals to strange dark realms!",House
16,The_Void,Comedy that isn't hilarious and horror that isn't frightening,6,24 February 2006,"Eighties horror cinema produced a lot horror comedies, and House is one of the most quintessentially eighties films that I've seen. That, however, doesn't mean it's one of the best. The film fuses horror with comedy, but in doing so; doesn't manage to spearhead either one. The film is amusing, but never hilarious; and the horror is so laughable that it's impossible to be frightened by it. The special effects fit the film in that they're jokey; but again they don't help it any when it comes to the horror side. It looks like the filmmakers couldn't really be bothered, and it that doesn't fill me with love for the film. Parts of the film are made up of Vietnam flashbacks; and if there was an award for 'worst representation of Vietnam', this film would run away with it for the ridiculous scenes here. The plot follows a Vietnam veteran turned horror writer who retreats to his dead aunt's house for some solitude while writing his new novel. However; his aunt must have hung herself for a reason, and this was also the house in which his son disappeared and his marriage broke up. Going back there might not be a wise move...This film pans out something like a less outrageous version of Evil Dead 2. Several things that Sam Raimi would utilise a year later are present in this film - from a severed hand with a mind of its own, to a moving wall ornament; but the film is nowhere near as good as the later surreal fantasy, mostly due its lack of finesse. The film is directed by Steve Miner; a man behind a couple of Friday the 13th films and the same one who will direct the Day of the Dead remake. Sean S. Cunningham, a man better known as 'that guy who directed Friday the 13th' has a producer's credit. The lead role falls to William Katt. On the whole, the acting in this film isn't too bad; but Katt isn't wholly believable as the linchpin of the movie. He's fine during the scenes where his character is being driven insane; but he just doesn't look like a Vietnam veteran, which makes it very hard to believe his character, and the film loses more credibility for that. George Wendt gets the best role, and as most of the comedy comes from him; he steals every scene he's in. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to people that love eighties horror; but as I love eighties horror myself, be warned that this isn't a film that eighties fanatics are guaranteed to love.",House
17,trashgang,teenagers will love this,3,16 April 2012,"I had heard so many positive things about House that I thought I was going to see a hell of a horror. Sean S. Cunningham was the producer, ahaa Friday the 13th (1980) and produced this flick, that sounds good. Harry Manfredini did the score, he's famous for his Friday The 13th score. It was also Fred Dekker his first writing before he moved further to Night Of The Creeps (1986) and Tales From The Crypt (1989-1992). And the director, Steve Miner, surely knew his stuff from Friday the 13th part 2 and 3 (1981-1982). But I also have seen some really bad reviews about House and I classify me under that label. What the hell was this, it was for me just a rip-off from Poltergeist (1982). The effects were laughable and even the monsters looked stupid. The zombie at the end was okay but he talked too much. The acting was okay and they even got a teaser with Mary Stavin (Tanya), who was Miss World in 1977. She was seen in 2 James Bond flicks, Octopussy (1983) as an octopussy girl and in A View To A Kill (1985) as Kimberley Jones. Here she only for a few minutes into the flick coming out of a pool in swimming gear. There wasn't any gore in it or even a piece of red stuff. It wasn't even frightening and for me had nothing to offer. So many people said that the laughed it out loud but my lips stayed sealed. I would recommend it for teenagers who want to be scared but even then in this time I see them go to Paranormal Activity at the theaters.

19,whpratt1,Too Many Flashbacks !,6,2 April 2006,"This was an interesting Horror film with some great humor and plenty of flashbacks to Viet-Nam and William Kott,(Roger Cobb). I must confess this house is very haunted including the brain of Roger Cobb, novelist of Horror and is presently trying to write a book on his experiences of Viet-Nam which is a Horror Story all by itself. Cobb lost is son in a drowning accident and his wife left him and so he decides to live in a very old home of his aunts. The aunt was very weird according to all the neighbors and as you can guess, the house has many creatures roaming all around the entire place. Not a Bad Film, but really not GOOD.",House
20,Red-Barracuda,A charming and well-crafted 80's horror-comedy,6,24 April 2017,"Roger Cobb is a newly divorced horror novelist whose young son has recently mysteriously disappeared. He moves to his aunt's house to write a book about his experiences as a soldier in Vietnam. The trouble is that his aunt killed herself there in strange circumstances and before long Cobb starts to experience malevolent paranormal activity in the house. House was produced by Sean S. Cunningham, the man who directed the hugely influential slasher Friday the 13th (1980) and produced the notorious rape-revenge exploitation shocker Last House on the Left (1972). It would be fair to say that with House, he was involving himself with something decidedly less controversial. This is in actual fact a horror-comedy which is not so far off being family-friendly. While it does admittedly have its share of horror moments such as demonic creatures and some suspenseful events, it certainly plays its comedy hand with more certainty. The result is a very likable film.This is a film which is not so well remembered now but it was a sizable hit at the time it was released from what I can recall, after all it did manage to spawn three sequels. It benefits quite a bit from very good performances from William Katt as Cobb and George Wendt as his friendly neighbour. Both have good comic timing and work well together, while Katt has to be given extra credit for still being capable of acting while wearing the most 80's V-neck sweater I have ever seen. Aside from the two leads there is also a lot of really good 80's effects and make-up for the various demons who plague the house, including a monster in the closet which I daresay haunted many a little kid who happened across this flick back in the day. It was also an interesting idea to combine the 80's movie staple of the Vietnam War in with a haunted house scenario. These strange bed-fellows are amalgamated pretty successfully I thought though, giving the movie a distinctive angle. Ultimately, House is a fun movie without ever being an essential one. It does display a certain craft and care though and, even if it is a bit limited in some ways, it's a film which is difficult to dislike and one which offers a fun 90 minutes for genre fans.",House

There, hair-raising terror and zombies lurk.This movie might be dated by today's (2020s) standards, but it's nonetheless entertaining with non-stop mystery and a fast-paced plot that will grab your attention from start to finish (no boring or dragged out scenes that I could remember).

24,thesar-2,The House King,5,29 July 2017,"After just listening to the podcast Shockwaves for weeks rave about the new House Bluray set of its franchise AND interviewing the producer/owner Sean S. Cunningham, I decided to visit the House(s.)It helps listening to all they had to say plus the interview because it was nice to pick up on the little details planted in the movie, like a Diet Coke® that Cunningham loves drinking and the ""Craven"" realty company due to Cunningham's (pretty much) start and admiration/friendship with Wes.The movie has some major tonal shifts that were more unsettling than some of the scenes in the movie. Most of the movie is straight horror, albeit just a haunted house story, while a good chunk is absolute slapstick humor which I did laugh out loud a couple of times. But often it went from deadly serious where I thought a character really couldn't come back from what he did to The Three Stooges-level jokes. Plus, some of the most outrageous things happen with the least amount of shock a normal person would have, namely from kids and our lead.But, the story of a divorced writer moving back into his Aunt's house where he grew up and immediately experiences the paranormal activity his Aunt warned about, was a tad fun to watch. He's also haunted about his vanished son and his numerous (shot-in-someone's-backyard) Vietnam flashbacks. If you don't take a lick seriously, enjoy the hilarious neighbor, NORM!, er, George Wendt and try to separate William Katt from The Greatest American Hero – which I found VERY hard to do, you'll probably have some fun here. ***Final thoughts: Along with the Diet Coke® and Craven realty, I also loved Don't Look in the Basement showing on the tele in one scene. When I was a kid and surely not allowed to watch horror movies, I would cherish my late night TV in my room and watch horror movies alone, unbeknownst to my parents. One I never got out of my head was: Don't Look in the Basement. That movie haunted me for years.Finally rewatched it as an adult years ago and yeah, it's a sh|t movie with a $5 budget, but for a 8-9 year old back in the early 80s, it was stuff nightmares were made of. I am proof of that.",House
25,gridoon,Low-rent.,4,14 August 1999,Low-rent horror movie with an illogical plot and particularly unconvincing Vietnam flashbacks (it was all-too-obvious that they were filmed in a studio set).

26,lost-in-limbo,Make yourself at home.,7,28 January 2009,"A true product of the 80s, but does that mean its anything less or far more I don't know but I had trouble not getting caught up in its irresistibly off-kilter charm and patchwork ideas. I truly have a soft spot for it. Yeah it's a mess, a clueless and incoherent one. However it's goofy nature, vivid visual effects and willing performances lend very well to a competent looking production yeah so what if those Vietnam flashbacks looked hokey and it's origins are cheap. This was the third film under the belt of director Steve Miner, who a couple years earlier brought us the raw, opening sequels 'Friday the 13th' Part 2 and 3'.Miner is joined by producer Sean S. Cunningham, the man behind the original 'Friday the 13th'. This time it's far from chilling (but it doesn't feel like its trying either well there are moments, lightly done though), as the angle is focused on the comedy, even if it doesn't have you constantly laughing out loud. It remains amusing nonetheless, while managing to be unpredictable in a way. We've flooded with ideas, artistic lashings and loose writing. William Katt makes for a likable victim, to his worrying state of thinking his going crazy due to the traumatic stress (war experience, missing child and marriage failure) or maybe it's the house and its dark, devious secrets preying upon his fragile mind.Roger Cobb is a Vietnam VET/ horror novelist that has tragedy on mind after the strange disappearance of his son Jimmy when visiting his aunt's house. His obsessive quest on finding him takes on a huge toll on his marriage, as his wife leaves him and now he wants to write a book about his Vietnam experience despite the growing success of his horror novels. After the death of his aunt, he heads back to the house and decides this is where he would write his new book. However he finds out there's more to this house, and maybe a chance to find his son again.Sounds like the typical haunted house shenanigans Well to a point. There are monsters (creative animation/ rubber make-up and the zombie soldier design looks awesome) stemming from portals to other universes through closet doors and bathroom mirrors. In the end I guess there just wasn't enough of it, compared to its boundless sequel 'House II: The Second Story'. The psychological aspect (yes it tries) is muddled and never truly explored; because it lets the daftness and convoluted tone take control of anything of importance through its Vietnam slant. Miner keeps a steady pace, drawing some minor moments of suspense and unhinged weirdness. The direction can feel a little too staged, and planned out in its set-pieces due to its change in shifts. Although the execution comes off better than it probably should have and is fairly presentable, as just look Mac Ahlberg's polished cinematography as the camera seamlessly glides through the set-pieces and Harry Manfredini's score is elastically piercing in its perky arrangement.Like I mentioned up further, Katt brings along an honest and capable performance. Around him is a down-to-earth turn by George Wendt. Who is good fun as Cobb's interfering neighbour. The stunning Kay Lenz doesn't get a lot to do, but her warm presence doesn't look out of place and Richard Moll is imposing as Cobb's Nam buddy. The beauty of Mary Stavin engulfs the few scenes she's in. Another asset you could say, and just as part of the film's character is the house itself. A formidable setting, but it didn't entirely have the lasting impact like I would've hoped and that's why the atmosphere (quite patchy) across the board didn't always have the same effect.Loony, spontaneous comedy/horror that doesn't entirely hit the mark, but does plenty to tweak ones interest.",House
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"I'll get you for this, Roger.",7,24 October 2021,"'House (1985)' starts out as a relatively straight-laced horror, with only a few laughs thrown in here and there. Before long, however, it transitions into a full-on absurdist comedy, sprinkling its horror with heaps of humour. It gets really silly but it isn't a spoof; it always maintains a balance between its giggles and its scares, keeping its real-world frights firmly rooted in the subconscious of its protagonist. It's often really funny and, perhaps more importantly, is constantly quite a bit of fun. In general, it's surprisingly effective. I wouldn't be surprised if it inspired 'Evil Dead II (1987)', to be honest, because it's quite similar in tone - even though it's nowhere near as refined. Though its plot is a bit loose and its Vietnam war aspects are a little shallow, it's a really entertaining comedy-horror that takes itself just seriously enough to work. It's a good time throughout. 7/10.",House
28,bowmanblue,As cheesy as they come,9,12 August 2014,"Whether you like 'House' will depend on how much you like cheesy films. House is a 'horror' film, only it's not that scary - it seems to be too busy messing around and generally being random to be completely scary. There are a few creepy moments, but what stands out are the collection of big rubbery monsters who invade the house one after the other.House is about Roger Cobb, who is a divorced author who moves to his aunt's mansion after she dies to continue his writing. Once settled in, he gets more than he bargains for.If you watched this in the eighties, you'll probably love it as it's just as much fun as it was then. However, if you're used to darker horror films (Mama, Insidious, The Ring) then you'll probably find this a bit tame and silly - and for a good reason - it is. But then that's what it's meant to be.Put your 'serious hat' on its peg, invite some mates round who all have an appreciation of cheesy cinema classics, break open the drinks and popcorn and have fun with this one, as it's the only way to enjoy it.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",House
29,bowmanblue,Welcome to the house of fun,9,2 August 2018,"No matter how much I have loved this film all my life, I still have to point out that the 'cover art' is a little misleading. If, like me, you've seen the rotting, disembodied hand floating as it presses a doorbell, then you may believe that what you're about to see is one of the most scariest films ever made. It isn't. I read online that the original script was written as a straight-out horror and a later revision added humour. What you're left with (thank goodness!) is one of the most entertaining black-comedy horror films ever made.Yes, it's very silly. Yes, there are big rubbery monsters lumbering around and yes it knows exactly what it is and never tries to be anything else. However, for all its (knowing) cheesiness, it's actually a very compelling story. Its characters all have purpose and there's a real sense that our hero - divorced former Vietnam soldier, turned horror writer, Roger Cobb - has been on a real adventure where he's grown as a character and actually accomplished something (a feat that many of today's Hollywood blockbuster scripts could take a lesson from!).While visiting his aunt in the titular 'house' Roger's young son vanishes almost inexplicitly, causing his marriage to break up and, eventually his aunt to commit suicide. Instead of selling the large house straight away, he decides to temporarily move in and write his new book. However, once there he discovers more than a few secrets - literally - coming out of the woodwork.Roger Cobb is played by William Katt (and actor I've never heard of, or at least haven't seen in much else). And he's brilliant. He's a hero we can get behind and root for in unravelling the mystery in what happened to his son - mainly because (a) he's not perfect. He has made plenty of mistakes in his life and is knowing that he's now living with the consequences and (b) he actually does things we - the audience - would in his situation. An example would be his first encounter with the supernatural - once safe he goes on to order about three large crates full of state-of-the-art (for the eighties!) camera equipment in an attempt to record proof of this encounter before he tries to convince others of his find.However, our hero would be nothing without something to overcome. And the house itself throws up more than a few antagonists for him to despatch. I won't go into who you could consider is the 'primary' antagonist, as this may well lead to 'spoilers,' but my personal favourite is the purple 'she-witch' who wouldn't look out of place duking it out with Bruce Campbell. Basically, 'House' is a delight to watch if you're into 'practical effects' rather than today's CGI, for there are all sorts of rubber nasties trying to hack, slice and possess everything around Cobb.As you can probably guess, I love this film to bits, but then I'm a big fan of comedy-horror. I'm guessing if you're into 'straight scares' this may not be what you're looking for. Plus if you're into today's form of more 'serious/gory' horror, this will seem too silly for you. However, if you're just looking for something simply to entertain with plenty of chuckles and silliness with teeth then this is definitely for you. Another film I say that you should watch before it gets remade!",House

31,CuriosityKilledShawn,"A crazy, but fun ride.",6,30 September 2006,"In the Eighties, horror flicks were all the rage. Sequels were obligatory and every year saw another Freddy, Jason, Pinhead or Michael Myers shocker. Among these were the House movies, which are a lot better than the genre reputation suggests.First and foremost, this is not strictly a horror film. There are some sprinklings of light comedy here and there and the monsters are so ridiculous that they don't really scare. It sure makes for a welcome change in a decade full of blood, knifings and slayings.Roger Cobb (William Katt) is a horror novelist, suffering from writers block. He can't seem to continue with his latest book, a recollection of his tour in 'Nam. The fans are eager but they want horror, not some war story. On top of all this, he is also dealing with a divorce and coping with the mysterious disappearance of his son. Depressed, he moves to his aunt's house, from where his son vanished and in which the old lady hung herself. A creepy log cabin in the mountains might be more appropriate, as Roger finds just as many distractions here.The first distraction is his neighbour Harold (George Wendt), who shows up at the worst moments to hassle Roger in the Ned Flanders style. The second distraction is a little more sinister. Monsters burst out of the closet at midnight, doors in the house lead into different dimensions and he is haunted by the memories of his best friend (Richard Moll), whom he betrayed back in 'Nam. Third, there is a sexy blonde, who bathes in his pool.One of the most appealing things about House is that Roger doesn't respond with any clichéd horror movie tactic - running away, falling flat on his face, hiding under the sink, etc. Instead, he buys a camcorder and tries to capture the monsters on film to convince Harold, and himself, that he is not crazy.He even manages to persuade Harold to help him catch a big raccoon, which hides out in a certain closet and only shows itself at midnight. Even at this, Harold gets scared, but not us. The film is only slightly dark and keeps a jovial mood for an hour and a half.Steve Miner (Halloween H20, Lake Placid) intrigues us as much as Roger as to what the hell is going on. Ethan Wiley's script is the tiniest bit loose, but is smarter than you would think and even contains a few little touches that you might miss on the first couple of viewings.It could have been beefier and longer, but if it was, it wouldn't be as irresistibly charming.",House

35,filipemanuelneto,"An old comedy, lacking in realism.",5,20 November 2021,"This movie, for me, is not horror. I never felt any fear, or even discomfort, while seeing it. Personally, I classify it more as an adventure or fantasy comedy, as the overall tone of the film is too light-hearted to really characterize itself as a horror movie. A film that surprises us for escaping the usual and routine in the genre, and for giving us moments of true unpredictability.The plot takes place in a nineteenth-century house where writer Roger Cobb has just moved. The house belonged to his recently deceased aunt, and he believes the house is haunted and the entity that remains there is somehow linked to her son's disappearance. And of course, whoever looks for it will find it. In parallel, we follow Cobb's efforts to write a drama set in the Vietnam War, in which he participated and which apparently has an autobiographical and cathartic edge to the writer. It was the part of the film that I liked least, feeling that the film slowed down a lot during these war scenes, inserted almost forcefully in the middle of the film. It would have been better for me if the movie didn't waste so much time on it. And of course, there are obvious problems of logic and verisimilitude a little everywhere, like in that obtuse relationship with the neighbor.The cast is made up of second-tier actors, but they generally do a positive job and strive to please us. William Katt is convincing in the lead role, Kay Lenz is a welcome support but barely appears, and George Wendt was effective in his work. The rest is limited to what you really have to do.On a technical level, it is a film that has aged and looks quite its age: the cinematography is quite lukewarm, with washed out colors, lack of contrast and brightness, although this is not even a real issue because it is a result of the technical and filming characteristics existing at the time. The house is a character in its own right and is magnificent and visually elegant, with a style that reminds me of the romantic chalets erected by the wealthy bourgeoisie of the mid-19th century. The sets are excellent and live up to expectations, and the soundtrack is suitably tense and dark. What really failed were the visual effects and the makeup: the visual effects lack realism, there were possibilities to do better, with more budget, and the makeup is obviously fake and doesn't convince anyone.",House

It's hard to pass this off as a serious and scary movie, where it leads more towards humor, yet it's still an engrossing tale of a troubled writer, who's Grandma (who we've seen in bit parts in many other films) suicides. He moves into his Grandma's two story place, to start on a new novel about yeah.... his experiences in Vietnam. Some funny flashbacks, here I tell ya, more like done in a studio. William Katt as the novelist is ideal, who thinks he's going crazy? Is it him, or this house possessed? That's the fun of the entire movie, where we have a few bit performances from actors I like, like Alan Autry and Steven Williams as cops. George Wendt as Katt's prying neighbor was fun too. If you want a few scares, more childish ones, and be humored, House is for you. It's one, if for morbid fascination, one of a kind horror movie, original, with inventive scenes, and in it's right, one hell of a thriller, all the way through, where we have to await the verdict of Katt's sanity.

40,drownnnsoda,"Not Bad, But Not Necessarily Good Either.",5,30 December 2006,"""House"", which seems to have gained somewhat of a cult following, is a movie I hadn't really heard about much, but after reading some good things about it, I decided to give it a try. The film opens pretty well - a grocery boy delivering some groceries to an elderly woman in a Victorian house discovers her hanging in her bedroom. Now, her nephew, Roger Cobb, a famous novelist, has inherited the old mansion, and decides to go stay there for a while to work on his Vietnam-experiences novel, after recently suffering through a divorce and the loss of his son who has gone missing. But while staying at the house, he is bothered by an odd and rather nosy neighbor (who also claims to be his number one fan), and begins seeing strange creatures emerging from his aunt's upstairs closet, and soon discovers that there is a whole other dimension behind the walls of the house.Not really a bad film at all, but also not a really good one, ""House"" is a unique mixture of horror and comedy, but is more humorous than anything else. William Katt, who played Tommy Ross in the De Palma classic, ""Carrie"", plays Roger Cobb in this film, and doesn't give a bad performance on any terms. The entire cast really isn't bad either. The story was interesting at some moments, but I was a little disappointed there. While this film is distinctly more comic than horrific, I was expecting something that was leaning on a more gruesome side. In a sense, this film can be seen as very fun, but in my mindset, I was expecting something different. There are a few creepy moments, and the beginning scene was done pretty well with the surprise body that swings on screen. The special effects were kind of campy, and the creatures were really funny looking (I laughed quite a bit when the woman turned into the slug-looking creature). Not entirely convincing, but I wasn't expecting marvelous effects, I mean, this is an '80s horror film. I'm not really sure about this movie, it's hard for me to decide whether I lean towards liking it or not liking it, and that's a rarity for me - I usually really like a film or I just don't.Overall, ""House"" is an unconventional and interesting movie. It leans toward comedy most of the time, but mixes in some horror, and I'm just not sure the combination worked quite right. I laughed on quite a few occasions, but was rarely remotely spooked. I don't know, maybe I should have sat down and watched it and expected more humor. Not a bad movie though, and recommended for those who enjoy late '80s horror flicks like this (and who don't mind their horror with some laughs). I'm on the fence with this, so I'll give it half and half. 5/10.",House

42,ferbs54,Cobb Story,6,16 December 2011,"Six years after producer/director Sean S. Cunningham released the wildly popular (but highly overrated) ""Friday the 13th"" in 1980, and several years after director Steve Miner helmed the film's two sequels, the pair reunited for the 1986 horror-comedy ""House."" Still another hugely profitable outing for the team, ""House"" is a more family-friendly affair, blending some effective jolts, rubbery-looking monsters and a great deal of silliness into a tasty but middling stew. In the film, we meet a Viet Nam vet--now a best-selling author--named Roger Cobb (appealingly and effectively played by William Katt). Cobb is going through a decidedly rough patch in his life when we first encounter him. His wife (Kay Lenz) has just divorced him after the mysterious disappearance of their young son, he's having trouble with the writing of his promised war memoirs, and his Aunt Elizabeth has recently hung herself. Roger moves into his aunt's supposedly haunted house to get a little ""solitude"" to further his writing...too bad, however, that all those yucky-looking demons in the house will just NOT leave him alone....Anyway, though certainly enjoyable, ""House"" proved to be just a little too tongue in cheek for this viewer. This is a film for the ""Goonies"" and ""Gremlins"" set, and certainly not for the serious horror buff. A little less comedy and a few more scares would have rendered this film a LOT more effective. As it is, those comedic elements are practically assured by the inclusion of George Wendt (riding high at the time playing everyone's favorite beefy barfly, Norm Peterson, on TV's ""Cheers"") as Roger's Gladys Kravitz-like nosy neighbor (essentially, he IS Norm Peterson here), and by the casting of Richard Moll (who was enjoying a similar great success at the time playing the childlike Bull on TV's ""Night Court"") as a soldier buddy of Roger's, and whose character is seen largely in flashback. The film piles on additional bits of silliness, such as the jarring misusage of the great songs ""You're No Good"" and ""Dedicated to the One I Love"" (sadly, NOT the Linda Ronstadt and Mamas and the Papas versions), as well as an extended babysitting sequence. The picture's script never sufficiently explains away all the spectral mishegas, and many instances of illogic and plot holes remain even after the big revelation toward the film's end. ""House"" gets by on the charm of its leading man, its barely effective FX and on the energy that Miner brings to his project. The film brought to mind two other movies for this viewer: 2011's ""Insidious,"" which also features a father entering a demon-haunted other dimension to search for his young son, and (of all pictures!) 1958's ""Monster on the Campus,"" which I'd just seen the day before, and which also shows us a man cutting his finger on a fish's tooth! I should add that it was nice seeing the beautiful Bond girl Mary Stavin (from ""Octopussy"" and ""A View to a Kill"") again, here playing Roger's superhot neighbor. In all, ""House"" is an entertaining if second-rate 93 minutes at the movies; it is supposedly much better than its two sequels, however. My psychotronic guru, Rob, has called the film ""minor fare,"" but in light of the director's name, perhaps we should instead call it ""minor Miner fare""! It is best watched with a few cold ones on one side and maybe your favorite 8-year-old on the other....",House
43,a_chinn,80s comedy/horror film strikes a unique tone worth revisiting,7,27 April 2020,"Memorable if not classic horror film of the 80s. William ""The Greatest American Hero"" Katt plays horror novelist Roger Cobb, coming to terms with the disappearance of his son as well as his PTSD from the Vietnam War (nice 80s movie trope there, eh?). Cobb inherits and moves into his crazy old aunt's house and that's where the fun starts. Almost immediately there are unusual happenings, which are far from sedate rapping on walls or mysterious footsteps in the hallway. This film was directed by Steve Miner (""Friday the 13th: Part 2"" and ""Friday the 13th: Part III"") and produced by Sean S. Cunningham (""The Last House on the Left"" and ""Friday the 13th"" parts 1 - 10) so subtlety is not what you should expect from this haunted house story. What you should expect is a fun riff on Sam Raimi style of over-the-top horror, which includes flying garden tools, sentient severed monster hands, and plenty of old school rubber suited and/or mechanical creature-feature special effects (without spoiling anything, the monster at the end of the film looks as amazing as any Jack Davis ""Tales from the Crypt"" comic book cover). ""House"" is pretty much non-stop monster action and that goes a long way, but the film is also unexpectedly imaginative when it comes to some solid horror visuals, including high cliffs suddenly appearing on the other side of doorways, or a fun scene where Roger lowers himself into a dark abyss, or a number of surreal Vietnam flashbacks (and not just surreal for the obviously stagey jungle sets, which are interesting in themselves, but for other creative elements). The filmmakers also get credit for doing a good job of balancing comedy and horror, managing to keep the film suspenseful and scary at times (the above mentioned lowering into the abyss scene is pretty creepy), while also keep things funny and light (George Wendt, Norm from ""Cheers,"" is a lot of fun as Cobb's neighbor). Another good example of this balance is when Cobb is lowering himself into the above mentioned dark unknown abyss, he encounters a fabulous stop motion flying monster who snatches his shotgun from his hands and then does a cowboy gun twirl before shooting it at Roger. Kay Lenz has a small role as Cobb's ex-wife and Richard Moll, best known at this time for his comedic chops on ""Night Court"" as Bull, is surprisingly good in a much menacing role as a Vietnam buddy of Cobb's. Generally speaking, ""House"" is a unique blend of scares and broad comedy that often doesn't work out well outside of an ""Evil Dead"" film. Admittedly, this is not up to Sam Raimi levels of filmmaking, but it is unique and well worth watching for horror aficionados.",House
44,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not scary or funny enough,5,3 October 2021,"Mixing genres in movies is not an unheard of move when it comes to making original ideas. Of those blends, putting horror and comedy together has proven to work. A more recent example of this could be The Cabin in the Woods (2011). Or if looking further back, Gremlins (1984) is another feature that has confirmed such a concept can be profitable. Of course though, with every success comes those who don't make out as well as they could have, for whatever reason. This feature has an interesting history since it was originally conceived by Fred Dekker, the poor filmmaker who ended up having what he wrote completely changed. Originally to be taken as a straight forward horror film, wound up being changed to contain horror and comedy. With that said, many could understand how that could upset others.So now, the film that actually is available is about popular novelist Roger Cobb (William Katt) learning that his relative passed away in the house he grew up in. But the house has more than just a childhood history with Cobb. At one point, Cobb lived with his currently divorced wife Sandy (Kay Lenz) and son Jimmy. However, just like the house itself leaving an impression, so did Vietnam as Cobb was a war veteran who lost a partner Ben (Richard Moll) in combat. Doing these rewrites was Ethan Wiley in his first writing credit and it kind of shows maybe changing the original concept wasn't the right decision. In short the technical aspects to this feature works pretty well, but the story is where it's hit and miss. It's unfortunate too because direction was handled by Steve Miner, who also headed Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) and Part III (1982).So why couldn't competent direction amend some of the experience? It feels as though most of it sits on the star's shoulders. William Katt as Roger Cobb is okay in his performance, but lacks the charm to really bring in the audience to feel the way the character does. Perhaps some of this alienation is on purpose because most civilians never understand the trauma of war. However, when adding elements of comedy into the mix it's just confusing. Should the audience be laughing or should it be as awkward as presented in the film? The only character that delivers some comical lines is Harold (George Wendt), a neighbor who is pretty much clueless on every level. The other supporting characters very much play it that same way but don't seem to make an impact. Surely the production wasn't banking on Katt and Wendt to deliver all the laughs. Aside from comedic line reading, the acting is acceptable from all actors.There's even appearances from Mary Stavin playing another one of Cobb's neighbors, Michael Ensign, better known as the hotel manager from Ghost Busters (1984), as well as Steven Williams and Alan Autry. Even with that to the film's credit, this picture isn't scary. It may frighten smaller viewers or those who just don't watch horror films...but the scare factor has no kick to it since bad comedic elements were thrown in. The visuals to the feature favor pretty well though. Because of the decade it was produced, much of the visuals are practical effects which all look decently crafted. The final boss looks good too although the verbal mouthing does not completely match lines dubbed in post-production. It's too bad since those creature scenes could have led to some rather gory deaths.Cinematography was another professional looking component. Shot by Mac Ahlberg, there are number of imaginative ways the house twists and turns Cobb in different directions; changing from one setting to another. Ahlberg also worked on Re-Animator (1985), Deepstar Six (1989) and Robot Jox (1989). Lastly, the musical score was composed by Harry Manfredini. Best known for creating the iconic score to Friday the 13th (1980). Manfredini seems to keep some of those familiar themes for better or for worse. While it does sound like it could belong to another Friday film, there are moments unique to this feature alone because of how the track was composed. The album also is a bit shorter in material but it still gives the listener a good idea of what was wanted to be conveyed.The technical parts to the film are very much on board, with solid camerawork, special effects and music. Sadly, the acting from the actors isn't enough to keep the experience from feeling dull. There's nothing horrific or funny about either aspect of the film, partly due to the lead's lack of appeal. It's average at best.",House

A fun 80's romp!",7,13 February 2012,"William Katt stars in the 1986 horror-comedy release ""House"" (also known in some circles as ""House: Ding Dong, You're Dead""), a fun little forgotten treasure from the creators of the ""Friday the 13th"" series. The film is very much in the vain as other horror comedies (such as ""Evil Dead II"" and ""Shaun of the Dead""), where our hero finds himself in a serious, life-threatening situation (in this film, a haunted house with connections to a hellish realm that brings your nightmares to life), yet also is full of good, light-hearted humor, and is arguably appropriate for some families with older children, as there isn't much swearing, sexual content or gore. And in fact, what little gore there is, is often stylized and cartoonish, giving it a ""Looney Tunes"" flair. With very minimal trimming, this could have easily been a PG-13 release, and it seems much tamer than other PG-13 80's films.Directed by Steve Miner, and produced by Sean S. Cunningham, ""House"" follows famed author Roger Cobb (Katt), a man dealing with the recent disappearance of his young son and his subsequent separation from his actress wife due to the stress of his son's vanishing. All that Roger can remember is that he was visiting his Aunt's home with his wife and son, and after losing track of him for only a moment, he seemed to vanish off the face of the Earth... there is no evidence as to his whereabouts.When the movie starts, his aunt dies of an apparent suicide, and he inherits her old house, where he plans to stay and work on his memoirs of being a Vietnam vet. (Much to the anger of his publishers, who assure them that the public is tired of war stories.) However, after moving in, strange events begin to occur- things moving by themselves, the appearance of startling creatures, and other horrors, and Roger realizes that they might be connected with his son's disappearance, and that he must face these terrors to get him back.There are also some fun, supporting characters, including his oafish but good-natured neighbor Harold (George Wendt) and a good performance by Kay Lenz as his ex-wife. Katt also does a great job juggling the horror with the humorous sequences, and proves to be a great actor. Miner's direction is very good, giving us both tension and great belly-laughs, and the script is tight and works in its own way. It was a competently made film.The humor also works quite well. A lot of it has to do with the absurdity of the concept, and a lot of the creatures, though eerie, perform gags that are similar to the Three Stooges. There is also a lot of fun to be had with how Katt reacts to the situations, including a humorous scene where he makes a fool out of himself to his neighbors by strapping on all of his old army gear and wandering about like a lunatic, preparing for combat with the creatures.The film is just plain fun.However, there are some drawbacks to it. For one, the ""rules"" are not quite established properly. We get the basic idea, but never get a 100% grasp on exactly how things work, which was a little annoying. Also, some jokes do fall flat and some are a little cliché. Finally, there are points where the pacing gets a little ""mucky"", and there are sequences that move by either too quickly or far too slowly, that interrupt the rhythm.However, the sheer fun of the film more than makes up for these downfalls, and I love this movie overall. I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to people looking for light, fun and occasionally creepy ride.",House

49,film-critic,Our House is a very very very fine house...,8,14 December 2004,"As far as campy ""B"" rated horror/comedy films go, House ranks up there near the top. First of all, look at the cast. You have an ensemble of television stars getting into the big screen using this film as their vehicle. George Wendt and William Katt are prime examples of this. Their acting level is below minimal standards and you can really tell that they are acting. You never really see the struggle of Cobb trying to write his manuscript for his next novel while having to deal with the demons in the house. You never really understand why Wendt is against Katt so adamantly. You never really get an answer as to why he stayed in that house and dealt with the spirits the way that he did instead of just bolting out the door after the first scream. There are several questions unanswered and plenty of cheapness to this film, but  and get this  that is what makes it phenomenal.Let's take a deeper look at this film. To begin it is a horror/comedy made in the 80s, which already sets the standard. The 80s were notorious for brining to light the horror/comedy genre and they made no exception here. The set and sound are not the best in this film, while the monsters are completely 80s (for lack of a better word). You can definitely see the differences between gory monsters of today, and those made yesteryears. There seems to be a focus on the absurd in the 80s, instead of the grotesque and unbelievable of today's standards. This is a cheesy film, and it was meant to be. That is definitely something I miss with today's films. I saw it briefly in Shawn of the Dead, but it still hasn't come full circle yet. I need a rebirth of this genre. Less nudity, less gore, and more undeniably 80s monsters. I believe that people would still flock to see it. I know I would be in line. The set, cinematography, and acting were all perfect for this film. When I watched this movie again with some friends, there were some that had not seen it and jumped on several occasions. That says to me that it has maintained a fright factor. You can tell if a horror film has lasted the test of time if nearly 20 years later others are still jumping.What also worked perfectly in this film was the comedy aspect. I don't know if it was trying to go for the sub-genre of parody, but there were scenes that I saw in this film that reminded me of some of the classics like The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ghoulies, and Evil Dead. It was a very good mix that worked exceptionally well in building that extra chuckle whenever Cobb did something you know is absurd. He is the perfect example of your uneducated hero. When he should be running outside to regroup and collect his ideas, he is instead running upstairs where the terror is greater. Whenever he attempted to write, but was constantly interrupted by ghouls, goblins, or even the neighbor, it made me smile. He was not your average hero, yet somehow I found myself cheering for him at the end.Overall, this was your average ""cult"" horror film that the 80s were notorious for. If you walk into this film expecting today's standards, you will be disappointed. If you go into it thinking of what the 80s were like, especially in the horror genre in Hollywood, I think you will be utterly surprised. I have seen this film several times, and it continues to get better each time I watch it. Katt does a superb job with the material and experience that he has, and nearly rockets himself into a Bruce Campbell clone. Well  almost  I don't think Campbell's status could ever be compromised! Enjoy  scream  and have a good time. Just watch out for when that clock hits midnight, you never know what parallel universe may be clumping around in your closet  BOOOOOOOOOOO!

That was the problem with many old 80's video nasties, there box art was much scarier and intimidating than the actual film.Anyway this franchise is classic 80's stuff with the kind of now cheesy rubber masked effects you come to expect and have seen in various other similar films. Again the idea does seem to stem from 'The Twilight Zone' or 'Tales from the Darkside' or even 'Tales from the Crypt'. Not an anthology of shorts but the plot behind the film could well be seen as an extended short from any of those films.The whole concept is the legendary haunted house idea which does work well if done correctly. In this film William Katt must fight the spirit and zombiefied remains of his former comrade who he unintentionally left to be tortured in Nam. Its basic, predictable, silly, hammy, crude and completely not scary, everything you want from an 80's horror.The great thing about this film and others of the era is the hands on special effects which are always such a riot. Full length rubber suits and prosthetics which do look great on the zombie Big Ben, large drooling cupboard monsters, winged skeleton demons in stop motion, gremlins, alternate other worlds behind the bathroom mirror etc...its all fantastic stuff which your never sure is real or imaginary.If you like films like 'Night of the Creeps' 'Return of the Living Dead' 'Fright Night' etc...then I'm sure you'll get a kick outta this.6/10",House

The scene where George Wendt's Harold meets William Katt's Roger (ha ha) is amusing in it's realistic awkwardness. I love the smile that Roger's grandmother gives the police and the scenes with the little boy are surprisingly innocuous. You get to see a flying deadite a year before Evil Dead II and a spry corpse that would have kicked Bud's rotten can. This movie reminds me of Cherry Falls in the way that it comes so close to being just another scary movie, but can't be discarded so easily.

This isn't your typical haunted house thriller; for one thing, it's done with tongue firmly in cheek, as if the filmmakers decided all the good serious ghost stories had been done already. For another, Roger's reactions to the weird demons that pop up in this house are not as expected, as if he knows he's inside a fright flic and this is the kind of stuff that happens once in a while in such situations. I would point out, also, that this pic probably doesn't have too many Vietnam vets as fans, as it trivializes the experience.The concept of some other dimension intruding on our so-called real world is also given a new lift here. It's not so much a ghost story as a riff on the ""Hellraiser"" and ""From Beyond"" concepts, done with humor, similar to the ""Evil Dead"" series. The sense is that we co-exist with some other, more sinister dimension, parallel with our own. A house such as this provides occasional openings to and from this alternate dimension. Towards the end, there's somewhat of a revelation about who or what is actually causing all this weird stuff, but real explanations are few - almost anything can happen, anything goes. Is Roger simply psychotic, imagining all these things? Is someone trying to drive him crazy? Or is it all truly supernatural? There's some mystery throughout the story as we go along on Roger's little self-imposed odyssey, though it's a bit too silly and inconsequential by the time it's over.",House
58,TalesfromTheCryptfan,An underrated 80's horror classic!,8,25 August 2008,"Roger Cobb (William Katt) was just your basic horror novelist who's aunt recently passed away due to suicide as he inherits her house. He's struggling to get through life ever since the mysterious disappearance of his son and the divorce of his ex-wife Sandy (Kay Lantz) and must write a book based on his experiences in Vietnam. Unfortunately, the dream-house he has now is a living nightmare when his memories of Nam haunts him including demons and spirits from another dimension start to threaten him as the evil is haunted by an evil force. He must try to question his sanity or prove that the evil in the house is for real as they keep taunting him.Excellent, smart and exciting supernatural horror comedy from Steve Miner and Sean S. Cunningham who brought you the ""Friday The 13th"" franchise! The story is made by Fred Dekker who brought us ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""The Monster Squad"" and this is one of the most underrated haunted house shockers around. It's quite original and very interesting with it's metaphor on how sometimes the past can haunt house and it's also quite H.P. Lovecraft-like in a surreal way, the monsters and spirits in this movie are fantastic. The film co-stars Richard Moll as a soldier who would later come back from the dead and George Wendt as a lovable but nosy neighbor, the film became a major success for New World Pictures and has gained a cult following to this day. The special effects for it's time were impressive including the demons themselves, there's a dark sense of humor and even a little gore to be shown in this terrific sleeper that is funny and scary.A must see! one of my all time favorite horror movies ever.Also recommended: ""Poltergeist"", ""Silent Hill"", ""1408"", ""The Shining"", ""Pet Semetary"", ""The Frighteners"", ""House By The Cemetery"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Series"", ""The Haunting (1963 and 1999)"", ""House on Haunted Hill (1958 and 1999)"", ""Thir13een Ghosts (2001 and 1960)"", ""Stir of Echoes"", ""The Orphanage"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Ghostbusters 1 & 2"", ""Gremlins"", ""Phantasm"", ""Re-Animator"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

59,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,The Greatest Good Horror Movie Ever,10,31 October 2018,"One of those comedy/horror flicks that, in 1985, wasn't so ""one of those"" since, years before, they were either one or the other, unless an intentional satire... But during the last twenty-five years, post SCREAM, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and many others, horror combined with comedy (where death can be funny yet still scary and final) has been commonplace, even cliché, and those movies were most likely inspired by AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and, for people in-the-know, HOUSE...Wherein William Katt's character, a horror novelist named Roger Cobb, is really more likable and affable than funny or trying for laughs: The perfect ambiguous pawn for what happens in the HOUSE he moves back into, once owned by his ""crazy"" old aunt, ranging from communication with his actress ex-wife (Kay Lenz) to flirting with a gorgeous blonde neighbor (Mary Stavin) to fighting a mounted marlin to strategically battling a jovial yet nightmarish ""witch"" monster leading to a formidable humanoid creature resembling Eddie from the Iron Maiden album covers....The best scenes occur within the HOUSE as Cobb and next-door neighbor Harold, played by George Wendt, investigate the two-story interior... for a purpose. By day, Cobb struggles on a non-fiction book that conjures up palpable war memories of his personal experience in what was extremely popular during the 1980's: Vietnam...The flashback jungle sequences (featuring giant cult actor Richard Moll) look glossy and contrived, obviously filmed on a back-lot location liken to a TV show (MAGNUM P.I., etc), but the primal direction from Steve Miner is edgy, fun and full of suspense: He was a b-movie student of the film's producer Sean S. Cunningham, who were both catapulted by the original FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise: Sean directing the first while associate producer Miner directed parts two and three...So there's a genuine and spooky, omnipresent feeling we're watching an authentic haunted house flick as opposed to a parody, and the severe main plot has Cobb searching for his son, who'd vanished in the swimming pool a year earlier. Present time and backstory connect within the multi-layered title location with something lurking around every corner; even when nothing's there, it always feels close. Simply put, HOUSE is a movie with everything.",House

It has an interesting story, great monster effects, and some scenes have an interesting surreal visual look.

61,Brian-272,Good underrated horror movie with many scenes of humor and suspense.,7,1 May 2001,"If you want to watch a movie about a haunted house then House is the movie for you. Not just is this film horror but also it has enough humor to also give a viewer laughs and most of all the story is well written by watching the movie the story reveals the whole plot of the movie though it takes time to develop it all comes together in the end. House is one of the better liked horror films of the 80's you can notice by the continued airings it receives on both premium and basic cable, I remember first watching House in the summer of 1988 and many times since I have viewed it when it shows on cable I even used to have a recorded copy put away. William Katt is great as a novelist(Roger Cobb) who moves into his dead aunt's house only to slowly but certainly find it is a haunted home with terror and most of all secrets. You see how the secrets brought out relate to the story so well as the connection to the abduction of the son of Roger Cobb and former Mr. Cobb war friend are made known in the end. Richard Moll was great as Big Ben and George Wendt couldn't have been better as the obnoxious and nosy neighbor of Roger Cobb. I must mention the scenes in House were great you just got a mixture of humor and suspense. I loved the scene when the dead fish comes alive and the other scenes of the closet monster along with the ugly fat monster, flying shovel and ax plus the Big Ben skeleton just made House very enjoyable. So if you haven't watched or want to watch again watch House especially when you want humor and a little suspense the cable networks both premium and basic give it many showings the acting is good so enjoy the 80's most underrated horror film.",House

It makes absolutely no sense, and not in a good way as some people on here have said that it does. It's a story that is all over the place, about a man who seemingly is losing his mind completely and totally, but at the same time fighting PTSD from being in the Vietnam War. You might think that this sounds like a good premise, it's not. The special effects, and the director, who directed the first three Friday the 13th movies which were way better than this piece of burning trash, are the only things it makeup for this horrible storyline. The actors don't even save it either, because they probably didn't even know what was going on either. All in all a waste of time, and the only reason to watch this film is for the trivia and that's it. Nothing more nothing less. Would not recommend.",House
64,noizyme,Stupid comedy-horror film proves to be neither and you should probably get your money back,2,3 June 2006,"Wow, people rated this as a 6-star movie? OK...Well, apparently in 1986 they were just throwing money at production teams to make the next piece of crap horror movie and get it into theaters as fast as possible. This film was shoddier than a B movie with little campiness to play off of. There were horribly atrocious-looking creatures and bad guys (and a flopping blue marlin which gets possessed while hanging on the wall) which makes up any B movie, but they weren't in the least thought out or anything. Dreamquest, the leader at the time in stop-motion and trippy effects for movies, animated some of the more complex ones which leads to the problem: too much money seemed to be used in the making of this B movie into a legitimate horror flick, which negates the comedy that they tried to put into the film.I don't know about you, but seeing the Great American Hero on screen doesn't mean comedy (or anything for that matter). They had George Wendt (of Cheers fame, at the time, as Norm) and Richard Moll (Bull from Night Court fame) filling in the random-actor categories. They both did an OK job of filling in the gaps between when you were getting confused as to WTF is happening and the next scene where you don't know WTF is going on.The story was lame, and I actually expected an Amityville ripoff more than anything. But basing a story around fear that this one man (whom the audience doesn't even care for, really) has to conquer is lame. The music was kind of cool in an 80's video game way. The sets that they built with added effects were OK, but IT'S A FREAKING HOUSE! JUST MOVE ALREADY! (I realize he couldn't move for the sake of his son being lost in the house or whatever, but the story through and through just sucked).All in all, if you really have nothing better to watch, go outside and play. Don't rent this if you think of campiness and cheap laughs are a good time because they're not here in this film.

68,shaun98,Enjoyable horror comedy,6,17 December 2002,"**some spoilers**Sean S. Cunningham will be forever remembered as the man who brought ""Friday the 13th"" to life. Although a financial success, the film did hurt his career by bottling him up into the horror genre. As most of the films he produced or directed flopped, his chances of breaking into the mainstream grew ever dimmer. Wes Craven has had a similar problem; although his films did considerably better, rarely does he have a chance to dabble into non-horror. Cunningham should not be completely dismissed, though; he also gave us the slight but amusing horror comedy ""House,"" and the equally enjoyable ""House II."" The original was helmed by Steve Miner, director of two of the ""Friday the 13th"" films (parts 2 and 3, to be precise). Based on these movies, one wouldn't think he was capable of crafting a more lighthearted approach to the genre. But there it is; a horror film that goes for the jokes and not the gore. A tormented Vietnam vet moves into his late aunt's old house, hoping to complete his latest novel. There, he must battle various demons, not only of the supernatural type, but his own self torment and the loss of his missing son.William Katt is not a particularly accomplished actor, but he is nonetheless likable and generates a great deal of sympathy for his plight. He realizes that the key to making a good comedy is to pretend the material is serious, making everything seem more ""real."" There are several ghoulishly silly incidents; the best gag involves a possessed severed hand, which probably inspired ""Evil Dead II,"" released the following year. The scene involving the ugly fat creature is also effective. Miner gives the film a slick look and delivers humor and suspense in equal doses. This is not the best the subgenre has to offer (that honor may go to ""Ghostbusters""), but it is a worthy effort that makes a more than adequate serving as a party movie on Halloween night. However, it still doesn't quite have the inspiration to go a step further.The ending is interesting enough, as Katt finds a doorway into the netherworld to rescue his son--and finds opposition by an old combat partner from beyond the grave. I admit incorporating the Vietnam elements could have been distasteful, especially in light of Oliver Stone's concurrent ""Platoon,"" but it's simply impossible to take this movie too seriously for any significant length of time. This is a ""filmmaker's movie,"" and a movie for horror fans--this is probably a good way to introduce your children into the genre. The special effects are competently done, given its limited budget. George Wendt gives a good supporting performance as the nosy next-door neighbor. ""House"" is good, cheesy eighties horror, the cinematic equivalent of visiting a haunted house.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by New World Pictures",House
69,Chromium_5,"A bit of a letdown in the horror department, but a good movie anyway...",8,10 March 2005,"The first 20 minutes or so of ""House"" are very intriguing, and it seems like it is shaping up to be a classic horror film. Unfortunately, right when you've come to that conclusion, the horror comes to a screeching halt and it turns into a kooky comedy. It's as if the director set out to make a serious psychological horror, but decided it was too hard and completely shifted moods for the rest of the movie.Once you can accept this, however, it is very entertaining. Roger Cobb is quite the interesting hero--the way he deals with the demons in his house is very odd, but hey, it's nice to see someone fight back in a horror movie for once. The middle of the movie is just crazy (but fun), and the last third is very, very good. The eerie scene where he is descending by a rope into what is apparently Hell itself is a classic horror movie scene, in my opinion. And the climactic ending with the zombie commando is too awesome for words.This isn't a true Horror movie by any means, but rather silly 80s cheese--but in that sense, it is the best of its kind. 8/10 stars.",House

71,Minus_The_Beer,Home is where the horror is.,8,12 January 2011,"One film that may have been swept under the rug amidst the wave of current '80s nostalgia is ""House."" The fact that it's been forgotten is a probably a good thing seeing as how it is about the only film in its time that hasn't been remade or isn't currently being targeted by Michael Bay or anyone else who would do it harm. In a way, ""House"" is a cult classic that is destined to stay a cult classic forever, and there are many reasons why.The first reason lies in its plot structure. To say the film's biggest weakness lies in its sloppy story-telling would be an understatement; at times, the film flat-out makes no sense. There are no rules when it comes to the supernatural elements of the story; therefore, the film gets away with murder, so to speak.Another reason would be its quirky sense of humor, achieved by its assorted cast. William Katt plays the straight man against the nosy and over-bearing neighbor, played by George Wendt of TV's ""Cheers"". On the other side of the coin, Richard Moll (he being of ""Night Court"" fame) plays the chief bad-guy, glorious special effects make-up job and all, disguising his usual persona all while adding to further amusement when he fails in harassing his former war buddy.Then, of course, we have the creepy yet amusing practical effects which define the film. The monsters or ghosts or whatever you'd like to refer to them as appear to be straight out of someone's nightmare, resembling nothing seen before and often achieved by something as simple as a latex mask. You'll giggle yourself silly as you watch Katt's character struggle with the skanky-looking goblin his ex-wife becomes. The laughs are derived partly because the scenario is so over-the-top and silly but also because the effects by which it is executed are just too good to be true and reminiscent of a time when horror movies had a certain authenticity to them, even when they didn't take themselves too seriously.Rather than go any further into analyzing the film and why it should remain an '80s relic, it must be said that ""House"" is simply a boat-load of good times. Director Steve Miner (""Friday the 13th Part 2"" and ""3-D"")) truly comes into his own with the film, which is both stylish and competently paced (too bad the director crapped out in the '90s). Meanwhile, William Katt carries the film on his shoulders, giving a performance that is both manic and sympathetic. Somewhere amidst the horror and the humor lies a story of redemption, and Katt somehow sells it. Although the film never quite settles on a specific tone or makes much sense throughout, it's still an enjoyable film that will deliver chuckles and jumps time and time again. It's certainly not a film for everyone, and that's the point. For those who prefer their horror off-beat and with a sense of humor, you'll found ""House"" to be worth entering.",House
72,piratecannon,"Knock, Knock",4,27 December 2012,"House isn't about a sarcastic M.D. who spends his days pontificating the medical mysteries that puzzle lesser men. No, this House is about a killer well house. It's a strange hybrid that might be best described as the test tube offspring of Poltergeist, Apocalypse Now and, perhaps, Evil Dead.It's about a guy named Roger Cobb. He's a horror novelist whose career has been waning since his son mysteriously disappeared while visiting Roger's aunt. His next ""big book"" just won't materialize because, among other things, Roger feels a pressing need to exorcise the demons he acquired while serving in Vietnam. Roger decides that spending some time alone in the house where his now dead aunt once lived (not to mention the residence where his son inexplicably vanished) will allow him to pen his next work. Living next door is a jovial neighbor—played by George Wendt—who likes to pop in at random, and across the street is a buxom blonde who pawns her son off on Roger so she can have a night out on the town.Soon after moving into the house, Roger experiences unexplained ""bumps"" in the night, which soon gives way to full blown monsters spilling out of closets and possessed hand tools hovering behind bedroom doors. The revelatory moment of the film sees Roger discovering that his long lost son is still alive—albeit in another dimension, a la Poltergeist—and that a man he'd served with in Vietnam has used his time in the afterlife to haunt Roger so as to get revenge on him for allowing the enemy to capture and torture him for ten weeks.All-in-all, House is a bizarre juxtaposition that's hard to label. It's both funny and wincingly lame, sporadically creepy and laughably dumb. To say ""it's so bad it's good"" is an exaggeration, and to say it's ""just plain bad"" isn't entirely fair. So, I suppose, it resides somewhere between the two extremes, a schizophrenic offering of sorts, one that'll leave you not knowing whether to laugh or cry.Still, on sheer creativity, I suppose it earns a little merit.

He goes on a quest to find his son with the help of his next door neighbor, and at the same time he is trying to write a new book.

There's no malevolent, unseen presence creaking the floorboards or banging relentlessly on the doors.Instead we have a comedy-horror-home-invasion subgenre hybrid that never takes itself too seriously. Our hero battles mutated zombies and a giant writhing closet monster, to name a few.Cobb destroys parts of the house in the process with grenades and a shotgun - putting his war experience to use. In one scene, he has to babysit his love interest's child, and manages to juggle babysitting duties with thd zombie bashing.With so much going in the relatively short 93 minute run time, it's difficult to pigeonhole House.

Would he rather forget that one and cling to the memories of House.Or how about Kay Lenz, she who has the most amazing jaw line, should they ever consider a revamp of Doc Savage look no further, Ms Lenz's career highlight for me was the very excellent 'Stripped To Kill' which had hot dancers, a killer soundtrack and a pretty decent storyline.George Wandt as Harold Gorton I could take or leave, his acting style has never really amounted to much for me, as for behind the camera, Steve Miner was already a seasoned professional when it came to this style of movie-making and as his mentor Sean S. Cunningham was their as his guiding light how could he fail.Of course the greatest aspect for me was the script, complete with a story by Fred Dekker, who really should try for a comeback, and a script by Gremlin puppeteer Etahn Wiley, Mr Wiley's career truly has been all over the place.No matter how many sequels that came to pass, you really can't deny that this first excursion into household terror really was the best, in fact it was priceless!....10/10",House
83,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,Unhearalded 80's gem!,7,15 July 2018,"I absolutely adore this movie. I forgot how much this movie kicks ass. It has just the right amount of comedy mixed with the horror aspects. The FXs are awesome; they walk the line between being comical and creepy. William Katt is perfect in this. He nails the role and really gets you into the character. For me, this is one of those unheralded 80's gems, one that really doesn't get enough attention.There are some plot issues and a few things that will make you scratch your head, but because the movie is so enjoyable it's easy to forgive them. While House may not be perfect, it sure the hell is a lot of fun. If you've never seen it, I suggest you track it down and give it a watch. I'll be throwing on the sequel which I have never watched in the very near future.My Rating: 6.5/10",House
84,ARTaylor,Good Introduction to R Horror Movies,8,31 May 2012,"I don't know when I first saw this movie. I know I was young, ten or eleven maybe. I remember being scared, and probably had some trouble turning off the light that night, but it never traumatized me. I've picked it up every so often ever since and always enjoyed it. It was one of the first R rated horror movies I saw, and now I'm hooked on the genre.This is a great film when introducing children to ""harder"" horror. For those ready to move on from Scooby-Doo but not ready for Night of the Living Dead or The Exorcist. It's scary and suspenseful but never terrifying. Tension builds and there are plenty of jump scares, but the frights never last for long. Take the closet monster for instance. Tension builds as Roger goes to the door and there's a big scare when it comes out. But afterwards it becomes almost silly. Same with the fish and witch. It's a lot like Evil Dead 2 in that it's never too scary to not be funny and never too funny to not be scary.There's also a good story to go along with it. It follows Roger Cobb who grew up with his aunt in a haunted house. He went to war and saw horrible things. His son disappeared at the haunted house and he's separated from his wife. Obviously, all this ties together in some way when the aunt dies and he moves back into the house. None of it ever becomes hokey or clichéd. The film allows time to get to know Roger before the haunting begins so we like him and understand his plight. There's also an interesting aspect regarding whether all the hauntings are real or just caused by the stress of his life.George Wendt from Cheers plays the lovable neighbor that Roger befriends and helps. He isn't that much different than Norm but provides lots of humorous moments. The only thing I wish they did better is to make the supermodel neighbor more interesting. She's fine for some T&A and the house does something with her (which I still can never get whether that was really her or if it was just the witch), but she never really serves the story well. It's little more than a cameo just to have a model in the movie.Each of the actors do well in their parts. All are great, though Richard Moll hams it up just a little too much in his Vietnam scenes. It features William Katt, who genre fans would know as the prom date from Carrie. This film certainly shows some range for him. The film is made by the crew who did Friday the 13th, Parts 2 and 3 and has the same visual style.The special effects work very well for the story. The ""ghosts"" are practical effects using puppets, like Star Wars, which looks a lot better than stop motion. As I said before, they look scary at first but grow silly the more they're seen. The walking hand is equally disturbing and funny.The movie may not be a classic of the genre, but it's well worth checking out. It's a descent ghost story with plenty of suspense. As I said before, this is a good movie to test children before showing them something like The Shining or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those used to more terrifying horror should know that this isn't the scariest thing on store shelves. It's a good, solid B-movie that won't really disappoint.Regarding the sequel, I say skip it. As light as this movie is, House II is much lighter and far campier. In fact, it's more like Weekend at Bernie's than Evil Dead. It's more of a fantasy-western than horror and never scary. If you're watching this movie and want more, go with the Bruce Campbell trilogy.",House
85,videodrome1234,Classic,6,23 August 2014,"Somehow I always get the feeling that they just aren't capable of making a really good horror flick anymore, but thankfully sometimes I'm surprised. Unfortunately that happens less and less so most of the time if I want to see a good horror I have to bust out my DVD collection. One of these older classics is House. Back in its day it was one of the VHS era's big films, it's out on DVD too but it didn't sell as well. It's a hidden cult horror. It doesn't have the following of say Evil Dead, but people who like the genre probably know about it. The film was made by Steve Miner, Sean S. Cunningham and Roger Corman. The first two names should be familiar to Friday the 13th fans, as Cunningham directed the 1st part and was the producer on the 2nd making a carrier out of the House and Friday franchises. Oh he did direct Deep Star Six that was a tribute to The Abyss, more or less successfully. Miner directed the 2nd and 3rd part of Friday, so we have him to thank for Jason's hockey mask, but he's also responsible for a heap of successful horror flicks like Lake Placid, Warlock, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. So if really can be said that House was made by professionals and that's why it's one of the 80s classic horror flicks. The story: Roger Cobb is a Vietnam vet whose career as a horror novelist has taken a turn for the worse when his son Jimmy mysteriously disappears while visiting his aunt's house. Roger's search for Jimmy destroys his marriage and his writing career. The sudden death of his aunt brings Roger back to the house where his nightmares began. The evil zombies in the house force Roger to endure a harrowing journey into his past. The film's big value is the undeniable 80s vibe. It's great to see monsters made for real and not out of CGI. The technical parts are cutely lame, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a part of that era of film making. The story is a little cliché, the terror in the huge house wasn't a new concept even back then. Plus even the start credits remind me of The Haunting. The directors work shows all his experience in the horror film genre, so despite the cliché of the basic story House isn't just a typical scary, ghost house story, but is closer to Sam Raimi's Evid Dead. The screaming of demonic beings, the Chaplin- esc situational comedy and the seemingly hopeless ministrations of the lonely hero all prove this. The actors work well within what we expect from the genre, but don't expect anything outstanding with the characters. William Katt was okay, but he doesn't come close to Ash's (Bruce Campbell's character in Evil Dead) genius. Mac Ahlberg the cinematographer though worked almost perfectly. His experience in horror films (Dolly, Re-Animator) showed here too. I have to also mention, that the monsters in House and the effects were outstanding, but that's not surprising considering the experience of the effects guys with films like Back to the Future 2 and The Fly. The film is a perfect example of what comes about when professionals get together to make a film in their favorite genre. When I first saw this film I didn't really know what to make of it. It was filled with humor, monsters, drama it seemed like a cocktail of genres watching it again now it lost this effect, so the films biggest problem is that if someone isn't watching it out of nostalgia they'll probably be quite disappointed. I was reliving the 1st time I saw it when I gave it a 7/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",House

87,megoobee,"Could have been better, it had potential",6,1 January 2006,"Growing up in the 80's, I recognized most of the lead actors from TV shows. (Katz, Moll and Wendt) Not surprisingly, the movie has a ""TV"" movie feel to it, especially the scene changes that are perfect for commercial breaks. The movie began eerily but soon bogged down and became boring. The cut scenes were tedious and took too much time from the movie. The female zombie reminded me of something from the kiddie show ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" and looked ridiculous. After a while, it became sort of a ""Laurel and Hardy"" type act between Katz and Wendt. Was the movie scary? Not to me. Was it entertaining? Not to me. I wouldn't call the movie a complete flop, it did have some moments, enough for me to give it an overall C grade. For a theatrical release, this film was way too pedestrian.",House

89,Horror_Metal,Extremely underrated and highly entertaining horror flick!,10,2 December 2009,"A writer named Roger Cobb (William Katt) moves into his late aunt's house to write a novel about his experiences in Vietnam. He soon discovers that the house is haunted and full of ghosts, zombies, dead fish, and various rubber creatures. He arms himself to battle these demons and search for his missing son, while at the same time being annoyed by his neighbor Harold (George Wendt). In a bizarre twist, it actually turns out that Roger's old war buddy is responsible for his son's disappearance and is also lurking in the house.I had a blast with this film and it seems that not too many people are familiar with it, unfortunately. William Katt is very likable as the hero and George Wendt is hilarious as his nosey neighbor. The rest of the supporting cast is great as well. The special effects are also done really well. The various monsters that inhabit the house are fun to watch, my favorite being the fat witch with the high pitched voice. I was so entertained when I first watched this movie that I didn't want it to end. I had a blast with it and still do every time I revisit this fun 80's thrill ride.

Finally got to catch up on this film and found it really entertaining. You just have fun with it. So many holes like Swiss cheese, but it is cheesy and great fun.
I wish there was a time again we would have guys dress up in rubber monster suits! That looks so much like fn and FANTASTIC costuming from a era that really has been forgotten (eg The Elephant Man, American Werewolf in London, The Thing, etc). Costume designers like Deborah Nadoolman and make up artists like legendary Rick Baker.
Great costume design by Bernadette O'Brien here, as well as Barney Burman doing the special makeup!
All of these fantastic ideas and skills should be deployed again in the movie trade as CGI has gotten way out of hand...

After a few screenings and more close encounters with freaky horror in general, i had to give House some credit for the wittiness throughout. The monsters and special effects did not feel too great though, even for a modest budget such as this, and though i'm a huge fan of Cheers, George Wendt just does not fit into the picture. Having him sliced up by the flying gardening tools (check out that scene !) would have been greater fun than the whole Norm-the-annoying-neighbour thing. I wont even lower myself to judge the acting skills of the leading man. All in all, the comedy takes the spirit out of the (so-called) scary moments and vice versa.

When I saw that Steve Miner had directed it I thought it would be a great movie cause I had seen Friday the 13th part 2 and Halloween H20 and I liked them a lot. This movie was a disappointment. Very few scary scenes, very few funny scenes, very few gory scenes, many silly scenes and lots of boring scenes (especially Vietnam scenes). The 20 first minutes are very boring and the last scene sucks. It finishes as it was a drama or something. The acting saves it a little but not that much!

99,jonandshellie,A strange film that is just too good to miss,7,23 July 2010,"Roger Cobb (William Katt of ""Carrie"" and ""The Greatest American Hero"" fame) is a conflicted writer who inherits his aunts creepy old house after she mysteriously and suddenly commits suicide in one of the upstairs rooms. Roger's life is in shambles thanks to the disappearance of his son from that very house, an event that not only ruins his marriage but sends Roger spiraling into an abyss of uncertainty and distress. Roger essentially spends the rest of the movie dealing with the strange goings-on in the house, which may be haunted, as well as dealing with his own personal demons and dealing with his snoop of a neighbor, played memorably by George Wendt.I am probably the only person in history who saw 'House II' before seeing the original 'House', and prefers part II to the original, but that is neither here nor there. 'House' is an extremely original story that has become somewhat of a cult classic as the years wear on. I must admit to absolutely hating the film the first time I saw it back in 1988. I rented it on a whim after scanning titles at my local video store (based mainly on my liking of part II) and remember thinking it was about as bad of a movie as I had ever seen. Several years later I was up late one night, sick with a head cold and unable to sleep, and decided to watch some TV. I happened across 'House' being shown on the local late, late movie. This was before the days of 900+ channels so my choices were limited. In fact, if I recall correctly, it was either watch 'House' or a Don Lapre ""making money"" infomercial. Needless to say I chose the movie. I couldn't believe it. Despite my earlier feelings on the movie I found myself enjoying the movie very much. The kooky weirdness and 'Evil Dead'-like tongue-in-cheek comedy is just what the doctor ordered when you are looking for an escape from the cut and dry crap that finds its way out of Hollywood nowadays.

Riffle shots, screams, all sorts of loudness and only one neighbor notices. (It's that kind of movie.) Eventually he comes to realize that the mental monsters he's been dealing with in writing his book have become reality -- The Boss Fight is with the zombie/monster/ghost of a soldier he betrayed. He finds courage, gets his son back, his wife comes, happily ever after. I saw this on its first release when I was boy. I really can't recall how well I liked it, but I definitely do not like it now. The actors read their lines off each other; the script has a complete arc but there's no craft but formula in this movie; the monsters are ridiculous, even for the 80's; and it takes itself seriously too, too often.Oddly, House Two, The Second Story is a much better film.

109,frankf-10,Purty dreadful,2,13 August 2006,"Really nice looking Victorian house. Everything else sucks ('cept maybe the neighbor in the bathing suit when she is walking away from the camera). It was one of these movies where after a half hour you know you should tune away for something more uplifting, like maybe to CNN to see the world coming apart, but you've already invested that half hour... and you have this perverse need to see how the main plot hook (the guy's son disappeared some time ago, causing his marriage to fail, etc.) gets resolved, so you hang in there. Don't do it. The ending is a total joke and the in between ain't any better.Maybe the movie wouldn't have been so bad if George Wendt had been given the lead. He was terrific in Cheers, but doesn't have any range at all. That would not have been a problem if he had starred here (instead of playing the buttinsky neighbor). Evidently, solid acting was not a requirement for House's casting director. More likely, the problem (aside from the director) was $ and re-shooting scenes probably not an option. Then again, maybe they thought they were doin' pretty good.OTOH, this flick might have been better if made by a bunch of teenagers in Podunk, Minnesota using their parent's video equipment. The ""effects"" could hardly have been worse (rubber monster masks and tattered garments). The attack by the closeted rod puppet monster was too much to bear.I realize this is a spoof, but it simply wasn't worth the time.

The script is silly as it is normally expected, but the mixture of horror and comedy seems to have the right formula, so that you are not overwhelmed neither with the tone of the suspense nor the comedy.

I must also admit I found a bit offensive the use of the Vietnam War, and the suffering it brought to many people, for comic purposes. The final part of the movie (third act) didn't possess the same dynamic of what was being seen so far, and the happy ending felt contrived.

Second, the ideas of House and its ""events"" that take place when Roger lives there is very imaginative, like being attacked by floating garden tools or a taxidermized swordfish coming back to life.

117,Wouldyabelieve,Just short of really entertaining,4,30 November 2008,"I know this movie has somewhat of a cult following but I just couldn't bring myself to rate it any higher than I did. It just wasn't scary enough to be a horror flick or funny enough to be entertaining like Evil Dead II. Although I have a pretty wide latitude as to what I'll sit though, I just couldn't bring myself to join the bandwagon.Believe it or not William Katt plays the starring role in this mid 1980s ""horror"" flick. The storyline had promise but misses on a few fronts. The old aunt seems to be an early key character but then really falls to the background if not totally out of the storyline. The actress wife also plays too small a role inserted here and there throughout the movie. George Wendt adds the comic relief but again as the nosy neighbor is not used to his potential. Finally is the house haunted or is it just Katt himself?The story is basically about a house which is involved in the disappearance of Katt's son years ago. After Katt's aunt commits suicide, he decides to move into her house where he had already spent much of his own childhood. He wants to pursue his passion which is writing about his experience in the Vietnam War. It is this war experience that lives at the heart of Katt's weird experiences at the house. Not soon after moving in, he starts to hear and see strange things, primarily at the stroke of midnight. Monsters and other objects (like shovels) are soon attacking him. Katt falls back on his military training to battle the house and its ""inhabitants."" We eventually get a happy ending as he finally prevails in defeating the ""monsters,"" rescuing his son, and it appears, reuniting with his divorced spouse.Again, I know many previous writers enjoy this flick but it just wasn't up to even the low bar I often set for these type of flicks.",House
118,kaneda-ku,Bizarre psychology and musical setting!,5,20 October 2007,"***Possibly spoiler for ""1408"" as well*** Partly well made and well produced, this movie is still decidedly bizarre in one aspect - how it treats women. Main character Roger Cobb is divorced but is at one time given a chance to reconcile with his young, successful, slender and very 80'ish ex-wife, whom he might miss; might hate (we never know for sure). His mind plays him tricks and during their meeting she is suddenly turned into an abomination - i.e fat, wrinkly and aggressive - whereupon he shoots her. And the music starts, a disco anthem chanting ""good riddannce, now I know who you are"". The body is mutilated and disposed of, and that's about it. Not a really mature way to deal with relationships and memories! The end titles are the same song, which puts this film in the very same category as for example ""1408"", but with a sprinkle of Vietnam and humour instead of cancer as in the latter.",House

120,andrew_edwards,"If This House Is Rockin, Don't come Knockin!!",10,25 July 2000,"Truly one of the best of the 80's horror-esque films,  House uses a unique blend of suspense, horror, and humor to create a quite enjoyable movie experience.  House is definatly the best film of William Katt's career(well known for his work in the Perry Mason made for TV movies) In House,  he plays a recently divorced man who is haunted by the disappearence of his son.  In order to get back on track,  he returns to the site of his son's dissapearence,  a supposedly ""haunted"" house which was left to him.  Of course,  things go arwy,  and soon he is plauged by an obnoxious neighbor(played fantasticly by George Wendt) and several strange ghosts and ghouls intent on playing with his fragile sanity.  There are some really errie moments,  but the film as a whole maintains a playful atmosphere. This is a movie that depending on your mood will either have you jumping in your seat, laughing your head off, or both.  Definately worth the hour and a half.  I would reccomend this to anyone who likes to lie down, relax,  and be entertained.  9/10 Stars. Have fun.",House
121,wolfhouse,Superb!,9,20 January 2008,"Its been a while since I've seen a truly original horror film of this caliber. The directing is reminiscent of Larry Cohen with a dash of Joe Dante. There's a couple 'head trip' scenarios, blending clever photography with idealistic acting, such as the mirror scene or the monster in the closet. The special effects are extremely good, but as a 80's film, it lacks of gore. So if your looking for a shyt load of fun, and a hand full scares, check out this highly under-rated classick.Directing- 9/10 FX- 7/10 Story- 9/10 Fun- 10/10Overall- 9/10",House
122,redneck7,I like House,10,15 March 2005,"Why can't movie makers make gems like this anymore? I am sure costs can be kept low by following the trend of casting almost unheard of actors. The odd bar fly from cheers could be thrown in I suppose, or to make it more contemporary, someone from 'Just Shoot Me'. And keep it away from that CGI rubbish. The effects that were being used in the eighties seemed more tangible and real, not like Van Helsing (?). House is a good horror/ comedy romp with some nice touches like that monstrous woman that would love to fellate Cobb. He chops her up though so he missed out on that one. Maybe his standards are too high. Big Ben is one of the most scary characters in films (I wasn't scared though) I'd watch it now if I had it and my Brother wasn't watching Blackadder.",House
123,kabanzafer,quite good but not satisfactory enough,7,16 September 2006,"This film is yet one of the horror classics of the last 80's. It is valuable with its director Steve Miner (one of the best horror movie directors) music composer Harry Manfredini (the best horror movie music composer according to me) and the '77 Miss Model of the World actress Mary Stavin. All those positive introductory information make you think that you will watch one of the best horror films ever. But actually it is not.It is quite good but not satisfactory enough. Anyway the connection between the Vietnam war, the loss of child Jimmy was good. Vietnam scenes were not attentive and could be better. Thanks to Harry Manfredini about the good soundtrack again. The ones who like horror movies like me should watch this horror classic but I do not guarantee that the ordinary watchers would like the movie.",House

125,impresario78,House thrives!,10,20 February 1999,"House was a marvellous excursion in the world of Horror Comedy and gave many people a glimpse of how to combine humour, drama and frightfully good scares.

126,joe-1569,Another coke-fueled monstrosity from the 80's.,1,1 April 2006,"Let me start by saying that I love watching B horror movies and I watch them constantly. I get a kick out of how bad they are, with their low budgets and lousy special effects - it's always good for a laugh, and usually more than one. But there's a fine line between a B movie that is bad in a funny, enjoyable way and one that is so god awful, it makes you want to hunt down and kill the creators.As you may have guessed from my 1 out of 10 star rating, House is of the second variety. Where to begin...?First things first -- you'll find this film in the horror section of your video store -- wrong! House is not a horror film any more than Schindler's List is a slapstick comedy. There is nothing scary about the film, nothing creepy or even remotely macabre (other than the wardrobe and hairstyling choices, which are a whole different world of scary.) The film places itself in the ""horror-comedy"" genre, a dubious genre which has birthed far more bad movies than good. House doesn't get either part of the genre correct -- as I said, it isn't scary and the humor is so insipid, poorly written and horribly acted that it's more likely to make you angry than it is to cause even the faintest chuckle.In my opinion, there is nothing worse than unfunny comedy. It's just an embarrassment for all of humanity. The animal kingdom sees these kinds of films and mocks the human race. The comedy in House is the equivalent of what you'd get if you gave an 11 year old with attention deficit disorder a video camera for a day, along with a bottle of caffeine and a pipe full of crack. Every ""joke"" falls flat, every visual gag is poorly filmed, every bit of physical comedy is sloppily choreographed and looks unintentional at best. I'm not sure how an entire cast and crew of a film could all make something so completely unfunny. Did no- one stand up and say, ""hey...you know what...big goggles and army fatigues don't make this lousy film comedic.""In addition, House also sports an utterly pointless, rambling plot that literally feels like it was written as the camera was rolling. Without being a spoiler, suffice it to say that any script that incorporates elderly suicide, child abduction, Vietnam flashbacks, magic doors, puppet monsters, a haunted house AND George Wendt is special. And I don't mean special like a unicorn, I mean short-bus special.It boggles the mind to think that a film that so completely fails could get made and still be around twenty years later. I guess that is a testament to the cultural deficit of the 80's and the lunatic idiocy of Hollywood producers.Don't ever watch this film. Even if it's free...even if you are offered money to watch it. Even if you are offered A LOT of money to watch it. You may be slightly richer, but you'll be left dead on the inside. This film doesn't deserve one star. This film is a collapsed star, resulting in a void in space-time with an incredible gravitational pull that sucks every ounce of happiness from your life for the 93 minutes you spend with it. You've been warned.",House

A classic!!!!",House
128,tghern,This movie is more symbolic and kind of a mind trip than a horror movie,7,11 August 2006,"The other guy had it right in this movie the things he sees aren't really there, they are his nightmares returning from Vietnam kind of like in the movie Jacobs Ladder...if you watch it with this point of view from the beginning it has a whole new psychological impact on you. The other people are seeing reality which explains their sometimes strange reactions to the incredible things they have witnessed. If you take the other approach and watch the movie as what he sees is real it makes less sense and is pretty corny when in fact it has an excellent plot when you dig into the ""mind trip"" angle of it. It basically is one more unique take on the Vietnam experience.",House
129,carlisleejackson,An Original Haunted House,8,15 January 2021,"So many people don't get the point of this one and that could lead the viewers to believe it has plot holes but it really doesn't. If you pay attention during a flashback scene the main character's aunt mentions the HOUSE is haunted and it caused the specified tragic event that I won't spoil. Also later the aunt is seen saying ""the HOUSE knows everything about you"" so what some may think is just all in the character's head or whatever.... it's actually not. It's the HOUSE. A simple haunted house with demons which can account for the ""plot holes"" people think it has.",House
130,ruben_rne,Good movie,7,9 June 2009,"I remember this movie so well from the first time I saw it. I remember I loved it back then, but well it was a bit disappointing to see it again. I first saw it when I was 11 years old, but now I'm a teenager and it doesn't keep up. It's just so old and confusing, it's hard to keep up. Bad animation and bad story too, but there's still something that make this movie descent. You'll notise it when you see the movie.I recommend this movie for youngsters 10-14 and not older, it's a bit childish. I give it as high as 7 stars because when I was 11 I would give it 9-10, and now only 4-5 stars. So 7 is a pretty good number for this movie.",House

132,romeyniromy,Surprisingly good!,5,21 August 2020,"I had low expectations of it seeing that it was a horror comedy, not a mix that interests me much, but it was pulled off well. Especially how the demons turn out to be the writer's own personal demons, that along with his missing son made it much more compelling. Overall it was fun, with some scares and complexity, kind of like a Van Der Graaf Generator song <3",House
