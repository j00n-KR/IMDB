Unlike Training Day the central protagonist of this film is the honest cop who's in a corrupt unit.Corruption and the Los Angeles Police Department seem to go hand in hand in the real world and the cinema world. Street Kings is the latest in a line of films about LAPD corruption. Keanu Reeves is our honest cop here and his character is a whole lot like Russell Crowe's in LA Confidential. The guy who just goes in no questions asked, and not too squeamish about his methods. Miranda is just a Latino surname for him.When another member of his unit is killed in a bodega holdup where he's also on the scene, rumors start flying that Keanu greased him to prevent the dead guy from dropping a dime on him with the Internal Affairs folks. Unit commander Forest Whitaker tries to protect Reeves, internal affairs officer Chris Evans works with him to find out the real story. When it's all sorted out it's quite a twisted tale. I would have expected a bit more from the creator of Training Day which boasted the mesmerizing Academy Award winning performance of Denzel Washington. Street Kings hasn't any performances that good. It's a routine police action drama, none of the cast need be embarrassed by their participation though.",Street Kings
1,Leofwine_draca,Reeves on sparkling form in a cracking corrupt cop thriller,9,14 November 2011,"Corrupt cop films are ten a penny these days, but STREET KINGS quickly turns out to be the finest of its genre: a lean, tough-as-nails, straight-to-the-point thriller that screams grittiness throughout. Keanu Reeves stars as an amoral cop surrounded by his even more amoral colleagues and criminals, searching for a spark of humanity in amid all the dross of his life. Reeves is, let's face it, a forgettable actor these days (remember him in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL? Nope, didn't think so) but he gives his best performance to date here, a multi-faceted exploration of an inherently good guy on the edge. There's absolutely no faulting him.The twisty-turny plot moves along at a cracking pace and fulfils the action quotient with plenty of decent shoot-outs and ambushes. The snappy dialogue is delivered by a cast populated with stand-out turns, whether it's Hugh Laurie's snarky internal affairs man or Forest Whitaker's friendly captain. Chris Evans, usually bland in superhero fare like FANTASTIC FOUR, delivers a sterling turn as the upstanding young cop and nobody feels out of place.If the film has a flaw, it's that it initially feels a little afloat, searching for a decent plot to latch onto. As it progresses, the story grows clearer until, come the end, I was riveted by some of the best twists I've seen in a good while and a genuine sense of danger and a guy out of his depth. Forget DARK BLUE, forget NARC, STREET KINGS is where it's at!",Street Kings
2,SnoopyStyle,formulaic cop drama,6,13 August 2015,Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is an aggressive hardcore undercover LAPD vice cop. He breaks the rules to rescue two kidnapped girls and Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) supports him. His former partner Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) accuses him of misconduct and internal affairs Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie) investigates. Wander is getting a promotion over Biggs. Ludlow is on his way to confront Washington when two men shoot up the store killing Washington. One of Ludlow's shots accidentally ends up in Washington. Wander covers up for Ludlow and assigns him desk duty. New homicide detective Paul Diskant (Chris Evans) investigates Washington's murder.This is a rather formulaic police drama. The acting is a bit too hard. Everybody is trying too hard. Too much is laid out openly. It's laid out so much that it makes Ludlow looks stupid by not catching on. Keanu Reeves doesn't have any subtlety. He's full-on in damaged boy scout mode. This could be more murky and gritty. It's well made but lacks imagination and the intensity feels fake.,Street Kings
3,Prismark10,Lacking in street smarts,5,23 September 2019,"Street Kings is a facile urban thriller that looks at police corruption. From a story by James Ellroy.

4,kosmasp,"Many Kings, one Prince",7,25 July 2012,"The movie is pretty entertaining. It might be easy to predict (you can see where it is going, if you've seen a few thrillers, even recently), but it's entertainment value is really good. You have quite a few good actors in it and Keanu Reeves. While he is known for his action movies and is better in them than in his dramatic roles, I personally think I would've added at least another point to my overall vote.So I would suggest you rent the movie first and see if you like it, before you go ahead and buy it. There is another Street Kings movie out there, but of course that will never be as good as this one. The acting talent alone on this one, is far higher. Nice little Action-Thriller to pass by time",Street Kings
5,jboothmillard,Street Kings,3,4 May 2016,"As with many films in similar genres, I was mainly attracted to this film because of the stellar cast in it, it was rated relatively low by critics, but I was going to watch it anyway, written by James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), directed by David Ayer (End of Watch, Sabotage, Fury). Basically LAPD Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a ruthlessly efficient unorthodox undercover cop, he is haunted by the death of his wife, he becomes obsessed with trying to track down the men who killed her. It is after his former partner Detective Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) is killed Ludlow's mission to find street gangs gets personal, Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) is concerned for his methods for going above and beyond the call of duty are no longer approved, it is reported to Internal Affairs Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie), and apparently an investigation against Ludlow is started. In order to complete his mission Ludlow teams up with fresh-faced Robbery Homicide Detective Paul ""Disco"" Diskant (Chris Evans) to trace the killers through the city streets, later the duo come face to face with the cruel cop killers, they must decide whether they are to uphold the law or seek bitter vengeance. Also starring Cedric the Entertainer as Scribble, Small Soldiers' Jay Mohr as Sergeant Mike Clady, Naomie Harris as Linda Washington, rapper Common as Coates, rapper The Game as Grill, Martha Higareda as Grace Garcia, John Corbett as Detective Dante Demille and Daryl Gates as The Chief. Reeves doesn't quite fit the part, Laurie doing his decent American accent isn't on screen a lot, neither is Whitaker, and Evans is alright, to be completely honest I couldn't follow this film very well because I got bored, it has many clichés as well, only the action sequences perhaps got my attention, overall it's an almost forgettable crime thriller drama. Adequate!",Street Kings
6,Quinoa1984,"sometimes kind of ridiculous, but it holds the attention and stirs the pot a little",7,13 April 2008,"I didn't go into Street Kings expecting a masterpiece, and I didn't get one. What I did expect is what I got, more or less: a competently made corrupt cops drama that throws on some heap-loads of stereotypes (not just racially or ethnically but just movie stereotypes, which may possibly be true to form them), and even crazy hysterics. If there is any significant achievement it's in taking the cop movie into such depraved depths it's like looking at a very entertaining infected boil: you know it'll pop any minute, and the pus might just run out a little bit here and there till there's more to squeeze out. There's almost an underlying current of hopelessness that gives the movie some intellectual lift, but at the same time it's such a time-waster that unless you're hardcore fans of the actors it's just about worth a rental.Keanu Reeves goes from wooden to soggy-bottom wood as a cop who has been doing some dirty tricks to catch the bad guys lately (like setting up two Koreans- who are bad dudes for sure- by having them jack his car and then catching up with them to pop caps in their behinds), and he might be ratted out by his former partner. But when his partner is killed in very conspicuous circumstances, he goes to investigate it further while on a quasi-probation for even being at the scene of the crime (the crime, by the way, has one of the cheesiest ""don't die on me"" moments I've ever seen, laughably bad in how it's executed, no pun intended). Now, the conclusion shouldn't be at ANY surprise to anyone in the audience who's at least seen ONE other work by James Ellroy, the film's co-writer.What does give it just a bit of extra lift is the extreme quality of the conclusion, how things seem so ridiculous that in any other hands this would be total nonsense. David Ayer, the director (and writer of Training Day, the perennial new millennium corrupt-cop saga), does have a good handle on the material though, even with ham-bone performance; Forest Whitaker is one of them, sadly, as he basically retreads his persona from The Last King of Scotland as the ""King"" of the corrupt cops. There is some not too shabby work, like a nearly phoned-in-from-House performance from Hugh Laurie (not unappreciated if you are a House fan), but it's mostly from supporting players like Jay Mohr in odd mustache and Common, the rapper, as one of the 'thugs'. It all kind of blends together as a pulpy orange of a B movie, good for something to not ponder too long over, but not as horrible as you might expect for a genre piece. It's a flavor of the season.",Street Kings
7,edwagreen,Street Kings- Are the Police As Bad as this Film? *,2,7 March 2009,Muddled film with Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker in the lead roles.Nearly every police officer is on the take in this constantly confusing movie. Bad guys killed turn out to be cops. Cops are killing cops in this total mess. It was just absolutely ridiculous.Who wrote this trite? Must be someone who has it in for the Los Angeles Police Department.Imagine police going out of their way to get samples of DNA from noted criminals so that they can be blamed for killings and then subsequently disposed of? Come on. Even Rodney King would begin to question this miserable film.,Street Kings
8,michaelRokeefe,Someone has to rule the mean streets.,8,11 September 2008,"Hard hitting and explosive crime drama. Keanu Reeves couldn't be any better. Reeves plays LAPD Detective Tom Ludlow, a hard-nosed cop with the street credit of delivering brutal justice and the talent of being involved in the higher profile cases. His Captain Jack Wander(Forest Whitaker)happens to be his best friend, especially following the death of his wife when things weren't the best. When evidence implicates Ludlow in the murder of his former partner(Terry Crews), the violence around him gets very volatile. The honored cop becomes the subject of a dragnet and he can't really trust anyone anymore.An all-star supporting cast includes: Hugh Laurie, Chris Evans, John Corbet, Jay Mohr and Cedric the Intertainer. The violence is definitely graphic and highly expected. This thriller is as smart as it is thrilling.",Street Kings
9,jotix100,Trigger happy,7,6 November 2009,"James Ellroy's prose translates much better to the screen than many other novelists. He likes to write using a lot of slang that might go over the reader's head. Yet, Mr. Ellroy's work with the right people in charge is needed for one of his books to be successfully made into a full length film, as seems to be the case with ""Street Kings"". Curtis Hanson's satisfying take on Mr. Ellroy's ""L.A. Confidential"" is about the best adaptation of one of his novels. On the other hand, Brian DePalma's version of ""The Black Dahlia"" failed to capture our full attention, which seems the case of this new work, ""Street Kings"", based on his own screenplay of the late 1990s written with the title ""The Nightwatchman"". The new film was co-written with Kurt Wimmer and Jamie Moss. The production was directed by David Ayer, whose second feature this is.The idea of a corrupt unit within the LAPD seems to be an ongoing theme for movies, as well as real life. At the center of the story is Tom Ludlow, a man that has lost his wife in a tragedy, and now he is a member of an elite unit within the police department dealing with the bad element that are trying to wreck havoc in Los Angeles. As the film begins Tom deals with four criminals that are holding two Korean girls that will be sold as sexual slaves. Those are the first casualties in a long list of people that will meet violent deaths at the hands of Ludlow and his fellow officers.Keanu Reeves, who has grown into a mature actor, does a good turn as Tom Ludlow, the man that has to deal with the realities that surround him in the department. Forest Whitaker turns up as the corrupt commander of the special unit where Tom has served. Hugh Laurie does an excellent job as the man from Internal Affairs. The supporting cast is excellent.One can only hope Mr. Ayer, a wonderful screen writer himself, will be asked to bring to the screen one of his own scenarios to prove he has what it takes to make good action movies.",Street Kings
10,dbborroughs,Okay thriller had too many cooks and was too long in the oven to as good as it should have been,6,14 May 2008,"James Ellroy penned tale of a cop, played by Keanu Reeves, who is a loose cannon sent on the trail of the killer of his murdered partner. Protected by his captain because he can get things done and hounded by Internal Affairs, Reeves soon finds he is descending into a world that he really should not be part of. Reeves is okay, if a bit wooden as our antihero. Part of the problem is that he isn't given a great deal to do beyond allowing events to play out around him. To be certain he is a participant in events but there is a coldness to him that doesn't give a great many clues as to what is happening inside him. One would suspect he took the role because it offered him a chance to say some pithy lines, and behave in a more or less serious manner. The rest of the cast is quite good and one suspects that Forest Whitaker (as his boss) and Hugh Laurie (The Internal Affairs guy) took the roles because they got to play a bit against type. Good instead of great the films script, a long time in the oven, shows signs of being worked and reworked so much that the script becomes confused because too many hands lost track of what was going on. Rest assured that the central thrust and much of the dialog seems to be the work of Ellroy, the ending is most assuredly his in plot if not writing, but all of the details the additional writers have added have blurred what ever had attracted a long line of directors and stars to the project. Worth a look on DVD or cable where you're more likely to forgive the flaws.",Street Kings
11,lastliberal,"How can you shoot a guy taking a dump? I mean, seriously, that's sacred.",7,14 March 2009,"The bona fides say this is supposed to be a solid cop movie. Directed by David Ayer, who wrote S.W.A.T., Training Day, and Dark Blue. Screenplay by James Ellroy, who wrote dark Blue with Ayer and L.A. Confidential; and Kurt Wimmer, who penned The Recruit, Equilibrium, and The Thomas Crown Affair. A cast that includes Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie, among others. It has all the elements for a great movie.Maybe having Keanu Reeves on point is a weakness, but those that don't like him will take satisfaction that he gets his ass kicked early and well. Me, I'm ambivalent, as I did like him in The Devil's Advocate and Speed, but they were a long time ago and I don't think he has matched those performances.Everybody tries to protect Reeves when his partner is killed, but he just won't let things go. Then they go after him.At the end of it, Reeves and Whitaker made this movie worth watching.",Street Kings
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""You bored or something?"" No, that would be the *exact* opposite of what I was during this",8,20 January 2010,"When I first took this in at the theater, I had high expectations, and it still blew me away. I remain spell-bound by this. It is an extensively well-thought-out and entertaining film. The plot is compelling, engaging and keeps developing, and while I had a hunch about one twist, I did not see them all coming. This has spot-on pacing, not a boring second to be found, or an overwhelming one for that matter. The cinematography and editing are excellent throughout. Every moment of the action is awesome, intense and exciting without being unrealistic(within the bounds of Hollywood, that is... which, if going by this, is actually entirely acceptable), and there is a solid and fitting amount of it. The music is appropriate for where this is set, not to mention really cool, consisting mainly of hardcore rap. As you can probably figure out, the tone of this is brutal, dark and gritty, through and through, and should not be viewed by anyone who may not be able to take it. The writing is astounding; the script, the dialog, the overall story, all of it. There is a lot of slang(the subtitles certainly helped me out), and some instantly memorable and utterly quotable lines. Almost all of the humor, which is also very rough(and the amount of which is considerable), lies in what is said, how it's put and/or its delivery; think verbal, British comedy(with four-letter words). The characters are distinguished, credible, and psychologically accurate, with no real exceptions, and while there is a heavy dose of macho-ism and bloated egos(some bits are soaked in, and dripping, testosterone), it never gets ludicrous, and there are several characters who help keep it grounded, in their more agreeable personalities. I think it is also notable that this, beyond a sequence lasting no longer than a few seconds, this does not at any point stoop to the lowest common denominator and try to appease and appeal to the young male demographic by simple parading something to gawk at. This isn't denying the existence of such, it just has nothing gratuitous in the way of it other than aforementioned brief part. The acting is magnificent, for basically every part(I owe Evans a heartfelt apology, the guy can actually do great work, and be pretty bad-ass), Reeves is believable, and Whitaker performs well in everything required of him in this. Both Laurie and Mohr, honestly, if you didn't know they usually go for making people laugh, you wouldn't know from this, they're straight-faced and professional all the way(and I'm not saying they're not funny in this). There is plenty of disturbing content and a ton of strong violence and language in this. The DVD holds an interesting director's commentary, a handful of informative featurettes, deleted scene with the option of hearing Ayer's thoughts on them(by the way, David, if I may call you that, I promise you, you put another movie up on the silver screen, and I *will* almost without a doubt go to the cinema to catch it when it comes out), alternate takes and vignettes(really short documentaries). All of them are well worth the time. I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it, as well as of the genres and those who want to watch pictures set in this environment. 8/10",Street Kings
13,view_and_review,A Movie of Unlikeable Characters,4,5 June 2021,"""Street Kings"" is about a specific unit of LAPD--or maybe it's about the entire LAPD. It's dirty cops turning on dirty cops with one dirty cop being the winner.Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is your old school Hollywood cop: the one who gets the job done even if it means violating the rules, because the rules don't do anything but hinder cops and aid criminals. He goes it alone Dirty Harry style without needing back up. Tom found out that his ex-partner, Terrence Washington (Terry Crews), grew a conscience and was assisting internal affairs. When he went to confront Washington, Washington was gunned down execution style by two gang bangers.From then on it was about Tom trying to find out who murdered his old partner. He was hard to take seriously knowing that he directly benefited from Washington's demise. You knew that Washington's death was more than meets the eye, but who was behind it was the question.There were no heroes in this flick and no good guys, just different levels of slimy. Though I don't like Mary Sues, I don't like corrupt people either, especially corrupt cops. Ludlow was just slightly less slimy than everyone else which is to say he was still no good and so was the movie.",Street Kings

Amalgam of ""Dark Blue"", ""Training Day"", ""Harsh Realm"" and ""LA Confidential"" largely due to director David Ayer's going to the well once too many (he penned the first three and directed the third) in this sophomore effort as auteur and with a hodgepodge screenplay by James Ellroy (the author of the fourth film mentioned) and Kurt Wimmer and Jamie Moss, winds up a been-there-done-that retread of a bad LA cop (Reeves at his most surprisingly wooden here) finally seeing the light of the worse cops he's associating with which leads to a trail of murder within the ranks, a set-up (or three) and some truly histrionic brow-slappers that have you wondering how he became a detective in the first place.

15,anaconda-40658,Street Paupers.,5,1 June 2015,"Street Kings (2008): Dir David Ayer / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie, Chris Evans, Cedric the Entertainer: Average cop action film about forced authority. Keanu Reeves plays a cop caught up in corrupt law enforcement when crime scenes are tampered with in favour of his innocence. When a partner is gunned down by two males, he sets out to find the killers and act his own brand of justice. Directed by David Ayer, the film contains explosive action with a well drawn plot until it gets dumbed down with revenge clichés that seem to run rampant in these films. Reeves does well as a detective pulled out of trouble only to witness the corruption first hand at the expense of an innocent. He eventually is reduced to the same corruption. Forest Whitaker plays the police captain whom covers up bad police conduct until becoming the victim of it himself. Others roles are not quite as broad but make good use of good actors. Hugh Laurie makes an appearance although perhaps more would have been nice. Chris Evans plays Reeves reluctant new partner who is caught at the wrong place at the wrong time and the handling of this is too sudden and brief for the character at hand. Cedric the Entertainer also makes an appearance but this film begins to lose substance fast. The film plays on entertainment over message but action lovers are the core audience.

16,gradyharp,And if you like James Ellroy...,8,21 August 2008,"Despite the fact that we are seeing a plethora of 'bad cop' movies, it is hard not to like STREET KINGS by the premiere writer of this genre, James Ellroy. This film is not unique in subject matter, but the pace of the action, the keen directing by David Ayer, and the cast of important and popular actors makes this film well worth watching. Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a damaged person after his wife's 'unsavory death' and he is the take-no-prisoners type of cop who goes after the tough gangsters and offs them rather than arresting them. His boss is Captain Wander (Forest Whitaker) whose unit is filled with corrupt cops (Jay Mohr, John Corbett, Amaury Nolasco, Chris Evans etc). There is brutal activity surrounding a personal feud between Ludlow and Washington (Terry Crews) and during a convenience store holdup, Washington is killed in Ludlow's presence. Internal Affairs Captain Biggs (Hugh Laurie) is out to pin the incident on Ludlow, but what happens as the death of Washington is investigated throws light on the depth of corruption within the police force. The manner in which each of the corrupt cops is taken out serves as the rapid- fire conclusion of the film. This is a dark film and were it not of Ellroy's storytelling gifts it could seem banal. But Reeves and Whitaker give excellent performances and draw the audience into this putrid vat of cop corruption despite the urge not to watch the deeds. A good action, heavily noir film. Grady Harp",Street Kings
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Street Kings,9,9 April 2008,"So I continue my foray into the theatrical releases this week as a break from the Festival proceedings, and choosing Street Kings is a no brainer. It was in Speed that Keanu Reeves donned a Kevlar vest and a devil may care attitude to save a speeding bus from annihilation, and after that he's gone on to other blockbusters such as the Matrix trilogy and countless of other romance movies. Here, he revisits that action genre as a cop with questionable morals, and while some may gripe over his acting ability, I thought that he was given a role totally within his range - that of a clueless gunslinger who's caught up in a web of intrigue far greater than he can fathom.Based on a story James Ellroy, who gave us L.A. Confidential and Black Dahlia, we continue the tale about corrupt cop culture, and with director David Ayer at the helm, who delivered Harsh Times and wrote Training Day, there's some amount of credibility and expectation with these two powerhouses collaborating, and from my previous enjoyment of their earlier movies, thankfully, Street Kings delivered spot on, with hard hitting, uncompromising action coupled with violence without remorse, and a deep undercurrent brewing on the political angle within the police department as well.We get introduced to Reeves' Detective Tom Ludlow of the LAPD, who in the first 10 minutes, we witness a classic Dirty Harry styled cop who lets his guns do the talking, and employs questionable tactics in getting the job done. And he gets off the hook easy because of his sterling reputation, and no doubt being given special treatment and protection from his direct boss Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker). Naturally it gets slowly revealed that the entire police team has plenty of skeletons in the closet, and while Wander may be the patriarch of the force, politicking his way to more power, he has his enforcer, Ludlow, at his side to straighten things up.And with corrupt cops come the probe by Internal Affairs, and here's where things start to get interesting, with potential moles, and doubtful loyalties being thrown around, and in the midst of it all is severe corruption, that it's nearly impossible to try and trust anyone around, more so when Chris Evan's Detective Paul Diskant gets thrown into the fray to investigate a case against Ludlow. For those who enjoy cop dramas, you'll be in for a real treat with the twists and turns, betrayals and double crossings, and when it comes down to the crunch, out comes the guns.But more importantly, it allows us to question just how much are we willing to sacrifice our moral ground, especially when revealing the truth will put us in bad light, or get us into trouble, and we're talking about trouble with a capital T, where innate self-preservation instincts will take over if we do not consciously make a conscientious decision to come clean. We can cover up, get people to cover up, or better yet, have someone in power to cover it up for you, but that only means you get sucked into a system, and it will continue to breed within you, for the worse.Street Kings is excellent stuff that blew me away (caution: Fan Boy mode is on), and the ending sure is one of a kind, with the usual soliloquy, but one that really made you think on both sides of the equation - what one would do and say in order to save oneself, and how one can lie straight into the eye of another. It's classic black eat black, showing how deep the rot has permeated, and the ending just demonstrates that sometimes unorthodox methods work, but with a caution that there are always more powerful people out there who play others like pawns on a chessboard. Besides, it was nice to see Forest Whitaker getting into the rough and tumble of things after a rather docile role in Vantage Point.",Street Kings
18,Mr-Fusion,Been there done better,5,14 April 2015,"Admittedly, David Ayer movies are hit-or-miss for me (leaning more toward miss), but even with James Ellroy writing the thing, ""Street Kings"" is surprisingly limp. Yet another film dealing with ingrained corruption and racism in the LAPD, this one has a lineup of seasoned and capable acting talent. Reeves, to his credit, is playing against type here as a disillusioned cop who's going beyond department policy and conscience. I mean, he is out there. But this is oddly stale material that never really becomes exciting. There are shootouts, and double-dealings, sure, but . . . eh. The one thing that really surprised me here (even back in 2008, before he nailed the role of Captain America) is that Chris Evans is really the highlight of this cast. Forrest Whitaker on the other hand . . . well, by the end, when the evil operation comes crashing down, the guy just sort of veers off into some sort of comical parody. It's bizarre when that man is the weak link in your film.5/10",Street Kings
19,siderite,Modern LA Confidential like movie,8,11 June 2008,"A mature and enveteraned Keanu Reeves plays a cop that is close to the ""dark side"", but eventually he sees the light and fights against the people that corrupted him. The story has by no means a happy ending and it reminded me, both in script and feel, of L.A. Confidential. While that was a little more complex a movie, the mood and moral were similar.I have to say that Forest Whitaker's role seemed shaped for Al Pacino. I do believe that either whoever wrote the part or Whitaker himself thought of Pacino when imagining this role.Other people in the cast were there merely for their names, I am sure, like a lot of rappers and other black entertainers and also Hugh Laurie who acted a few lines with his House demeanor, but as an Internal Affairs cop.Bottom line, it could have been slightly better. The story was obvious from a point on while stubborn Keanu just wouldn't catch on. I rather prefer I don't catch on and feel stupid afterward than feeling bored while I wait for the lead character to catch up to my insights. It was a well made action/cop thriller movie, with good acting and directing.",Street Kings
20,namashi_1,Average....,4,2 January 2010,"David Ayer's 'Street Kings' is an average action fare, with not much going for it.The problem with 'Street Kings' is it's story, it's plain outdated. The film has a few gripping moments, and a likable performance by Keanu Reeves. But apart from the pluses mentioned above, nothing really works in this attempt.A film on corrupt cops, drug-trafficking is something we've seen many, many times before. Plus, the twist in the finale leaves no impact whatsoever. You can easily point out who'll be the culprits, there is novelty in the writing or the execution.In the acting department, As mentioned Keanu Reeves rules the show with a likable performance. Chris Evans is decent in a brief role. Forest Whitaker is alright. Hugh Laurie is wasted. A great actor like him deserved more footage. Cedric the Entertainer is routine. Others are adequate.'Street Kings' is, at best, an average fare. Watch it if you've got nothing to do.",Street Kings
21,KineticSeoul,Watchable but forgettable crime flick,6,19 April 2013,"Director David Ayer is known for making movies about corrupt cops and the ghetto. And this has just about all of David Ayer's trademarks but just isn't as good as ""Training Day"". The first half is good but than it starts to go downhill from there. The plot is about a tough cop Detective Tommy ""Tom"" Ludlow(Keanu Reeves) who doesn't care about the law, he cares about what is right and his own justice. He doesn't care about money or fame or his own well being, he cares about unleashing street justice. In another one getting the small fishes and killing the big ones. And it goes in one of those directions where the protagonist keep digging when others around him keep telling him to stop which gets that protagonist into a bit of trouble. Now these types of premises are alright but it's just done in a very generic way, where it goes from street interrogation to street interrogation and so on. It just didn't stand out. This is the second role I seen Keanu in where he plays a cop that previous one being ""Speed"" but this time he is way more rough around the edges.

22,Buddy-51,ho-hum corrupt-cop drama,4,9 April 2009,"In ""Street Kings,"" Keanu Reeves plays a rogue LAPD vice cop who does more dumb things in a single day than most of us do in a lifetime. Already under investigation by internal affairs for undisclosed breaches of code and conduct, Detective Ludlow further compounds the problem by personally going after the ex-partner who's apparently in the process of ratting him out to the authorities. From thereon in, the inconsistencies and implausibilities begin piling up faster than the corpses that are left in Ludlow's wake everywhere he goes. And even though his name and face are plastered across every newspaper and TV screen in the city, Ludlow walks straight into a den of murderous thugs posing as a drug dealer.Riddled with preposterous plot turns and cheesy dialogue, this James Ellroy-inspired police procedural (he co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story) boasts yet another wooden performance from the reliably under-whelming Reeves, and wastes the talents of Forest Whitaker, Chris Evans (""Fantastic Four""), Cedric the Entertainer and Hugh Laurie (""House"") into the bargain.",Street Kings
23,sol-kay,"A couple of walking talking ""Extenuating Circumstances""",7,16 April 2008,"***SPOILERS*** Looking the other way and letting the cops do whatever is necessary to keep crime in check some higher ups in the LAPD have created an entire squad of Dirty Harry's who shoot first and ask questions later. That's after making sure that the person their to arrest isn't around to answer any of them.The top honcho of this group of renegade policemen is Det. Tom Ludlow, Keanu Reeves, who besides everything else is constantly drinking, miniature bottles of vodka, on and off the job. Det. Ludlow is a man to whom the law is nothing but something to break if it stands in the way of him doing his job. We get to see Det. Ludlow in action early in the movie in him gunning down a number of Mexican kidnappers whom he tracked down in their hideout. Not only is Ludlow indifferent to the kidnappers rights as well as their victims, the 12 year-old Park Twins, safety he's doesn't even have the common decency in letting one of kidnappers, Garret Sato, answer the call to nature as he guns down the helpless and embarrassed man while he's peacefully sitting on the can doing his thing!It later turns out that Ludlow's former partner Det. Terrence Washington, Terry Crews, has gotten his fill with Ludlow's ruthless and illegal actions on the streets of L.A and is turning evidence on him. We don't exactly know what Washington is telling the Police Internal Affairs Department but it's enough to get Lulow so hot under the collar that he, after accidentally spotting him going into a bodega, goes after Washinton with both murder and malice in his heart.It just happens as Ludlow is about to cold cock Washington two masked thugs break into the bodega shooting at everything in sight blowing the store clerk together with Washington himself away. Ludlow who survived the carnage, and in fact tried to save Washington's life, is now suspected in setting Washington up. It's obvious that the bodega robbery was a hit not a robbery, with nothing being taken from the cash registry, in order to take Washington out.Det. Ludlow now determined to find Washington's, who death he feels responsible for, killers is told by his boss Capt. Jack Wander, Forrest Whitaker, to just forget about it and let things be. It seems that Washington was involved in a drug smuggling ring inside the LAPD in that his supposed killers, identified through DNA and the bodega's security camera, local hoodlums Coates & Fremont were in fact sprung by him after they were caught trafficking in drugs! Was this, Washington's murder, in fact payback for his trying to go straight by talking to the LAPD's Internal Affairs Department?The movie ""Street Kings"" has more then its share of action, provided for the most part by Det. Ludlow, but the most interesting thing about it is how deep corruption is ingrained, going back to the 1930's, in the LAPD. We together with Det. Ludlow get to see that it's drugs, and the money that goes along with it, what motivates a large percentage of cops in the department not the law that they were sworn to uphold.****SPOILER ALERT**** The biggest shocker of all is that Det. Ludlow was in fact used by his higher up's to both murder or set Washington up for the kill. Washington was not ratting on Ludlow as he at first thought***MAJOR SPOILER*** but on his boss Capt. Wander and those corrupt cops under his control. Cops who were pushing the drugs on the streets of L.A!Implausible but still exciting final with Ludlow, finally coming to his senses, confronting his manipulating and corrupt boss Capt. Wander at his pad, that he purchased with drug money, in the movies tense and final sequence. Living high off the hog Capt. Wander had the walls of his house stuffed with millions, maybe even billions, of dollars. Money that Capt. Wander not only got from his drug, through those cops under him, operations but from blackmail money from politicians from city and state from the governor and mayor on down. Politicians who among other things, in their secret personal lives they've been hiding from the public, are also taking drug money and whom Capt. Wander, in order to protect his a**, also got the goods on.P.S Forest Whitaker's performance as Capt. Wander was without a doubt one of the most incredible acting jobs in motion picture history. Whitaker is so intense and insanely honest in his interpretation of the crazed and somewhat religiously fanatical Captain Wander that it would be a crime if he doesn't, like in his performance in ""The Last King of Scotland"", receive the Best Actor Academy Award hands down which sadly I doubt he will.",Street Kings

Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a hard bitten, wise-ass LA cop who makes his colleagues and superiors edgy in different ways. Deciding to administer some of his own rough justice to a colleague who talks to Internal Affairs for a better life, he ends up being at the scene of his murder when two gang-bangers with automatic weapons come by and blast him to death. With the finger of suspicion pointing at him, it's in Ludlow's best interests to track down the killers himself. But as he does so, he uncovers a tangled web of conspiracy that threatens to tear his world apart.Any film with Keanu Reeves in the lead role is unlikely to be nominated for any awards for best leading actor, and this is certainly no exception (Most Wooden Line Award here going to a scene at the beginning where he asks two hoods if they'd 'like to buy some pu$$y?' or something.) Luckily, Street Kings has quite a lively supporting cast to back it up, including Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie, Jay Mohr and black comedy actor Cedric the Entertainer, obviously trying to break through into more serious acting. While for the most part it is a solid, compelling cop thriller with an intriguing plot with clever twists and turns, the narrative flow is a little weak towards the end and the film doesn't always maintain the tension and involvement it needed to be really great as a result, unlike the far superior Training Day. Still, it is far from awful cop thriller that still manages to keep up the hard hitting, unflinching 'real' feel of cop life on the streets of LA. ***",Street Kings
25,MLDinTN,Why does Hollywood think that police corruption and...,6,8 March 2009,"bad language are 2 key ingredients for a good film. I thought this movie was pretty good and didn't need all the f bombs and what not thrown in. Keanu Reeves, plays Tom Ludlow, and he is a bad cop (sort of). Forrest Whitaker, plays Captain Wander, his boss and he's running the show. In the first 15 minutes, Ludlow goes into some Korean crack house, blows them away, and saves 2 kidnapped girls. And Wander helps to make his story stick, that he was fired on first.Another cop, Washington, thinks Ludlow and Wander are dirty and is talking to internal affairs. One day, Ludlow follows Washington to a store intent on smacking him around. But 2 thugs show up with guns and blow Washington away. Ludlow accidentally shoots Washington too, which leaves a big mess for him in the investigation. He starts hanging out with Diskant, the detective on the case, who feeds him some story about Washington being corrupt and selling police confiscated dope. And his murder was a business dealing gone bad. Is all of this true? Or is someone trying to cover up a bigger story? Ludlow really does feel bad Washington was killed and is intent on finding the killers. But what he finds is a bigger story and corruption that runs deeper than he thought.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was entertaining. And I like Reeves and Whittaker. The only thing I could do without is the cussing. It didn't need to be that much and when it's like that, it's distracting. I recommend it only for adults.",Street Kings
26,A_Different_Drummer,Pretty much sets the bar for this kind of story,9,5 October 2015,"Most of my reviews have a story.No wait let me correct that. Most of my better reviews have a story.Here I had just finished the bizarre and controversial second season of True Detective (this written in 2015) -- a series which tries to run a similar plot arc and fails, notwithstanding some brilliant performances, including Rachel McAdams like you've never seen her -- and it occurred to me that this film from 2008 had actually done it right.So we have Reeves before he became irreversibly type-cast doing martial arts films, Whittaker who has never given a bad performance in his life, and Laurie taking time off from House to leave an unforgettable impression in his scant screen time. (And still with one of the best American accents in the industry, upstaged only by Robert Taylor in Longmire) And direction to die for.A near-perfect film, you can watch it over and over, it never really gets old.Just wanted to set the record straight.You're welcome.",Street Kings

Shortly thereafter, he's murdered and the hero is put on the trail of a Matterhorn of corruption: more than even HE can stomach.",Street Kings
28,jzappa,Technically Well Made Standard Cop Fare,7,31 October 2008,"A story's characters must have certain qualities, and something in their life caused them to have them. Even if we never, ever see the causal scenes, the writer must know that those causal scenes happened. The characters in Street Kings have qualities caused by lives of watching cop movies from the 1990s. I enjoyed this movie. It was not the trashy cash-in action movie one could easily presume it to be.Keanu Reeves plays Tom Ludlow, a disheartened L.A. Police Officer Who Doesn't Play By The Rules, and is Haunted By The Death Of His Wife. All of the cops in Ludlow's unit, including their captain, Forest Whitaker, twist, manipulate and at times totally shatter the rules of conduct habitually. Their intent is, time and again anyway, to take care of crime in an approach that they see as more effective, which finds them more often than not lying, fabricating reports and stage-managing evidence to cover their tracks.The movie opens with Reeves, Waking Up With A Hangover. Working undercover, he meets with two Korean gangsters in a parking lot, who are looking to buy a machine gun from him. After a brutal beating, they steal his car. Tracing his car to the Korean's hideaway, Tom breaks in and kills everybody, and then finds two missing schoolgirls who were the reason for his pursuit of these guys in the first place. He then moves on to cover up what really happened. While the other officers in his unit applaud him, he is challenged by his ex- partner, Washington, who no longer accepts the corruption and fraud and has returned to a law-abiding status as a cop, reporting the issues to Internal Affairs Captain Hugh Laurie, who starts an investigation against Reeves while at the same time proving once again that British actors playing Americans are so seamless and impeccable at it that vice versa doesn't compare.Perhaps Reeves belongs in this sort of film. It would be insulting to deny that he is above Bill and Ted, but he has yet to show strength in a sophisticated dramatic role. He is not a bad actor. He simply belongs to a certain age group. He plays embodiments of what most young guys envision themselves to potentially be, were they protagonists in action films. Street Kings, though it is no Speed nor Matrix, is no exception. He gives his character bitterness and stiffness. Perhaps the film's strongest performance is by Whitaker. In a film full of prospectively compelling characters, he reaches full potential with the written part.A great deal of this movie's charm is its attention-grabbing assembly of actors. Chris Evans, one of our newest pretty boys whose chops as an actor have had to wait awhile to truly show themselves, plays a young rookie detective with the predictable outcome. Stand-up comic Cedric the Entertainer is an unlikely and very persuasive choice in the role of a forlorn drug dealer used by Reeves and Evans as an informant. I was particularly surprised by the chilling performances by an actor named Cle Sloan and rapper Common as Fremont and Coates, or perhaps two criminals masquerading as Fremont and Coates, a question that in itself poses a relevant moral symbolism for the effect the undercover police work has on the film's cops.Who isn't entertained by Jay Mohr being thrown in the trunk of a car, but by now I'm thinking that there is that familiar action movie tradition, the abundance of sausage. Where are the female characters? I am careful not to say, Where are the women? Because of course there are women, but it seems the only woman in the film is Naomie Harris, the entirely scripted and trite Voice of Reason, who of course is later in peril. Duh!Street Kings is overall pure, laid-back entertainment. It is violent, vindicating as such, ripe with an interesting cast and not infected with the flashiness that most crime films with rappers as actors suffer. David Ayer is respected and deservedly so for his insight into the inner workings of police, in particular the LAPD, with such scripts as Antoine Fuqua's powerful Training Day, the watered-down cornball walk in the park S.W.A.T. and his directorial debut Harsh Times, perhaps the most interesting of all his concepts. Frankly, screenwriter James Ellroy, the mind behind the ageless L.A. Confidential, is an ear-perking name in the crime genre as well, having written Street Kings years ago, inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial. Unfortunately, Ayer's sophomore effort at the helm falls prey to the other extreme, which is that there is not a lot of energy here. It is purely standard fare, technically well made but without the sparks which would make it memorable.",Street Kings

And when it's left in the hands of the writer of Training Day, in what must be his directional debut, that's just adds more plus's. I loved the use of L.A locations here, many we've seen before like in the barrios, or from aerial views, mountains and city in the backdrop, whatever, Street Kings, didn't disappoint one iota. Again this gritty film that just involves you all the way with it's many layers story, that works well for thriller sakes. Again police corruption runs high. Who is good and who is bad. Well there are not many who are good. Keanu, implicated in a robbery, goes to all lengths to find out who's setting him up. He isn't helped by a heckling Hugh Laurie (the film's best performance) riding his tail, who steals the film the way Anthony La Paglia did in Whispers In The Dark, as a smart cocky I.A. officer. Keanu gets matey with an I.A guy (super cool Chris Evans, who's very good here) who could be his last hope. There are car chases, foot chases, some well staged and tense shootouts, you name it. The only let down is it's title, yet fitting just not really original, like a lot of titled films that start with The ....

"" The story is one of many from the record books kept by good men who are trying to clean up the mess. Herein we have Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) a good cop gone wild. His once pristine ideals have been obliterated and replaced by a street mentality of 'if there're bad they get what's coming to them.' However, he has come full circle as he is now trying to clean up what was once sacred to him. Hugh Laurie plays Captain James Biggs a good cop out to reign in the bad elements within the department. Forest Whitaker is Captain Jack Wander who runs a Special Unit under suspicion by the F.B.I. for corruption, brutality and drug laundering. Now both men are working to save their reputations and are unaware of the undercover officers who are out to root-out the bad elements. Chris Evans, Jay Mohr, Cedric the Entertainer and Terry Crews as Detective Terrence Washington add to the top notch acting as does the car driving action sequences.

32,freemantle_uk,A silly little thriller,6,30 November 2009,"If you watch American cinema and television you would believe that pretty much all police officers in New York and Los Andreas are either corrupt or become vigilantes. Hopefully that is really the case. Here is another film following these themes in the tradition of films like Dirty Harry.The film tells the story of Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves), a grief stricken officer who often takes the law in his own hands. The film starts off with him raiding the home of Korean gangsters and saves two 14-year-old who had been kidnapped. This quickly make him into a hero cop. His former partner Detective Washington (Terry Crews) dislikes his methods and goes to Internal Affairs Officer Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie) to investigate Ludlow. Washington ends up getting killed by two gangbangers, and evidence shows that Ludlow could be a suspect: he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The department run by Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) were willing to bury the incident. But Ludlow believes that something dodgy has happened, and ends up working with Homicide Detective Paul Diskant (Chris Evans). They soon discover something much more complex is going on.This is an action-filled film, and I can praise it for the realism involving the violence, and for the fact the film focuses on the rougher areas of L.A. It does show an interest in racial politics, poverty and gang violence. There are also good performances by Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie (it's good to see him doing well in Hollywood).But there are problems with this film. The biggest problem is the script, which is filled with poor dialogue and plot holes. Some elements didn't feel as realistic or gritty as it should have been. It also lacks a moral compass, with the view to supporting vigilantism, especially in the beginning. It felt like the film was trying to be an extended episode of The Shield (a good American programme). But unlike The Shield the plot isn't as strong and there are more sympathetic officers in the programme to balance out the anti-hero lead. It also felt like that The Departed and Infernal Affairs were an influence on this film; but this is no Scorsese or Andrew Lau/Alan Mak film. It should have tried to stand on it's own two feet. There are also problems such as when Washington is shot. He has two men with machine guns shooting him at point blank range but his body is still in tack, he is able to stay on his knees and doesn't not die straight away. It's not very realism, especially with the type of film this it. The film takes itself a little too seriously.There is a poor choice in a leading man, Keanu Reeves. Reeves is a very successful actor, and I do like him in The Matrix and A Scanner Darkly. But he is also one of the most uncharismatic actors around and does not have the acting chops for this type of role. An like Christian Bale would have been more fitting.The director for this film is David Ayer, a successful screenwriter of Training Day and the really bad U-571 (which he has at least said sorry for). This is his second feature and I think he does have some potential. But he is from the kinetic school of directing where the camera doesn't stay still for any scene, whether it's an action scene or a more calmer discussion. His early action scene was so overly edited that it was distracting from the action itself.An okay film, but could have been a lot better.",Street Kings

For lovers of on-screen brutality, a club I am a member of, there are some bloody, intense action sequences. The gunning down of a black cop in a convenience store has the intensity of the uncut boardroom scene in ""Robocop"". The bullet hits (squibs) are supersized, as are the performances. The overall look of the pic is grim and grainy. This is Ellroy's first original screenplay; the story was not derived from one of his novels. Why it's such a mess is anybody's guess. The problem with Reeves is credibility. No matter what he does and what he says, how he says it and how he does it feels wrong. I'm sure the guy's sincere, but he's totally miscast.

37,Enchorde,"Good cast, better movie!",8,11 July 2009,"Recap: Tom Ludlow is the tip of the spear, as his boss puts it. He is also a cop operating outside the law. He sees himself as both judge and executioner, shooting first and asking questions later. His latest case, rescuing two kidnapped children, brought him to the public's attention. He's a hero, but his methods has not gone past Internal Affairs. So when his former partner, now an Internal Affairs informant, is murdered in what appears to be a robbery gone bad while he is there he suddenly finds himself in deep trouble. But what is worst, that he goes free but meaning that the murderers does too, or to catch the suspects but risking everything himself? Comments: A nice surprise really. I got his as a two for one package along with Jumper, and saw this as a bonus. But this was at least as good as the other. So I'm happy.Street Kings is interesting, and a little different from a certain point of view. The hero. Sure, we have dealt with a lot of dirty cops before, but then the hero has almost always been the righteous champion. Tom Ludlow is not. Actually, the only thing that differs him from the criminals he is hunting is his badge. Tom Ludlow is not our champion, and will never be either. Because even if Ludlow has his eyes opened during the movie, he sure is a dirty cop to his core. That feels new anyway.Otherwise this a good actionthriller. There is secrets and suspense all the way. No one is what they seem to be and the story twists and turns all the way. Unfortunately it is quite easy to say early on who the main combatants will be, but that didn't disturb me a lot. There was always some more immediate twist or secret to focus upon. And then there is action. A lot, and quite violent too. If you dislike too much blood and violence, this might not be a movie for you. There is a lot of blood, lot of gore, and the movie doesn't do much to protect us from it. And that's good, if you can handle it.Finally there is the cast. Full of good actors, Keanu Reeves is solid in the lead. But Forest Whitaker is stellar. A personal favorite, yes, but with that comes high expectations. And he doesn't disappoint. And with them supported by Hugh Laurie, Chris Evans and Jay Mohr, to name a few, it gives a very strong cast.A good story delivered by a strong cast.

He never uses his eyes .
All great actors use eye movement and make subtle looks to portray their characters but Keanu doesn't have that capability.
Because of that , roles like this and John Wick suit him and he's ok in the film .
He's kind of overshadowed by a real actor in Forrest Whittaker who only has the one eye that works better than Keanu's two !The plot is extremely baggy . It makes very little sense . The characters are one dimensional and you can spot the bad cops a mile away .

Considering that Ludlow was off duty, the perps got away unnoticed, and the security cam footage is kind of muddled, the department makes Ludlow a suspect. For some reason the department wants to keep things under wraps, which may make trouble for Ludlow when he starts to do a little of his own investigating to catch the killers.

Leading a pack of detectives he makes up his own rules regarding crime fighting. Not all in the force accept this state of affairs and Ludlow's former partner Terence Washington (Terry Crews) is at the forefront of the cleaning squad. That is until Washington gets whacked at what seems to be a hit-and-run at a local grocery. However Ludlow, who by chance was at the scene of the crime, feels that this version reeks of rotten old fish...The cop thriller is one of America's premier movie discoveries. Over the years they have managed some great classics like ""The Bad Lieutenant"" or ""Training Day"". Mostly thanks to some gritty action, crisp dialogue and testosterone filled atmosphere. With a star cast including Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker, Chris Evans and Hugh Laurie expectations were of at least a decent script, even if an uninnovative movie. The beginnings are rather positive, when the hero of the hour turns out to be a Paul Kersey type cop (Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"") with a shifted moral compass and alcohol issues. His actions throughout the movie decidedly place him within a quagmire of questionable behaviour, albeit somewhere at the end of it all lays a policeman with ultimate good intentions.Keanu Reeves, despite his obvious acting limitations, wins the role thanks to his animal magnetism, so lack of range fails to hinder the acceptance of Tom Ludlow's character. A much bigger issue comes from the supporting cast, especially in regards to Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie. Whitaker lacks any conviction throughout the movie, showing some suspiciously lazy dialogue and never getting away with it. Hugh Laurie does pretty well for the most part, but as the movie increasingly delves into the absurd you can feel the actor struggle to speak his lines, as if he was aware of the corn falling off its cob.That basically brings us to the main issue with ""Street Kings"" - the script. If I had to write a treatment for this movie it would actually show quite a lot of basic promise that the whole concept had. Nonetheless the devil in the details is one messy son of a Belzebub. To start off with the plot is structured so poorly, that the end conclusion is obvious before the first act is finished, giving away multiple spoilers and hints, making the story easier to solve than a 30-piece puzzle. Somewhere in between the movie tries to meander and muddle up the foregone conclusion, but only manages to rack up the laughability and pounce on the credibility. These two apparent flaws start toppling on top of each other and with 30 minutes to go the real fun start. Literally. Characters exchange nonsensical dialogue, as if taken from an episode of Baywatch, irrevocably bringing in the laughter and jeers from viewers.By the time the end credits role the only logical reactions are either passing on this whole affair, writhing in movie-loving agony or doing a live ROTFL. I honestly missed the final dialogue between Reeves and Laurie, as I was still head over heels crying out of laughter after the last conversation between the above-mentioned Reeves and Whitaker. Definitely a movie for all involved to disown.",Street Kings
42,bob-rutzel-1,Very Good,9,14 November 2008,"Somewhat disgraced Detective, Tom Ludlow (Reeves), is on the trail to find out who killed his former partner, and he knows Internal Affairs is watching him. He doesn't always go by the book.The story is good yet..somewhat complicated, and we have a lot of good-cops/bad-cops and the trick is to find out which is which. A good story needs these twists and turns, you see.I am becoming more and more a Keanu Reeves fan. He showed me something in this movie. I liked his performance. I knew what he wanted to do and I went with it and was not disappointed. But, he never said, ""Whoa"" and I miss that. But, the ""stare"" is still there and that's something. Am somewhat disappointed in Forest Whitaker as I felt he was too animated. Okay, maybe not. That's his shtick. Jay Mohr did okay (apparently comedy isn't working for him). I cannot say enough about Cedric The Entertainer. He is good in comedy and in drama roles. Most comedians do well in drama roles as they seem to understand that timing better than most. I always recommend drama to those comedic types who don't seem to be funny. That or selling cars. No, they don't listen to me. They just go on making millions of dollars not being funny. Funny, eh?Hugh Laurie was a surprise in this and in a hospital scene early on, I thought he was playing his TV character, Dr. House. But, no, he was Internal Affairs. And, he steals the scenes he is in. Didn't Bogart do that too?The entire cast did well and there was sufficient suspense and tension in the right places.These heavy Police dramas seem not to want to use any humor at all, and that is, of course, a mistake. We could have had a real classic here. Humor helps everything along. But, what do I know?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",Street Kings

And it only took about five minutes to figure out who was gonna die and who was gonna survive.As expected in mainstream movies of this kind nowadays, it's much of boring blood and much of boring ultra violence, together with some rotten corpses. The movie pretends to tell deep things about power, but that excuse for showing all this amount of unrealistic killing is a bad one.Certainly Keanu Reeves has got a lot of money for doing this, but that anyway ought to be a poor compensation for him.

44,intelearts,A brilliant exploration of gray morality and the best police movie since The Departed,9,21 May 2008,"This is a terrific movie. Superbly written and directed it is the only film I have seen in the past year that really tackles the morality of our decisions, and refuses to simply opt for black and white answers. For me this drove the film more than the excellent action or settings, or music, or script: there is a sense that a lot of thought went into the gray areas, and it is that that makes this a good movie.Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a cop whose life has seriously fallen off the rails. From the top of the movie we know right away that he can't start the day without hard drink, he's a loose canon who gets the job done with little consideration for the trial process, but beneath it all he finds he still believes cops are there to do an honest day's work. As the film develops and his world goes very very wrong indeed he finds his faith in right restored even as his whole world crumbles around him.Keanu Reeves is slightly stiff at times but aided by a brilliant support cast that do an outstanding job. From the Mexican cholos to internal affairs the acting is solid and very well done. There is not a weak performance among them, and more than that, there is scene after scene of real dramatic excellence.Above all the story drives the piece, and combined with the action, it makes for a hypnotic movie that definitely is worth viewing.Very highly recommended as one of the best cop movies since The Departed, and regardless of genre a terrific film in its own right.",Street Kings
45,leftbanker-1,One of the Best Cop Action Movies in Years,9,5 August 2014,"If you disagree with my title summary, I defy you to list better movies in this genre from the past decade. If you're looking for watchable action movies these days you have to look pretty hard. I could count on one hand how many decent cop thrillers I've seen lately. Street Kings, even with its flaws, is a solid piece of crime drama with some iconic action scenes.Screenplay by James Elroy. I didn't know this before watching the movie but the quality is evident at every step along the way in the drama. The action scenes are intense and there is a lot of tension created to make those scenes resound even more deeply.I think this may be the only movie where I actually liked Keanu Reeves. I've tolerated him before but he's good in this role. Forest Whitaker is another matter. Ever since his over-the-top (read: bad) performance in The Shield series it's obvious that he's either a really bad actor or a one trick pony.The opening few scenes are enough to validate your admission ticket. There are a few other good scenes and a few bad ones but I stand behind my initial statement. I suppose that my praise for this film says a lot more about the sad state of movies these days than it does for the quality of Street Kings.",Street Kings

It is not as intense as previous examples. But it still delivers which can be contributed to the great actors. Keanu is convincing enough and manages to carry the movie. Forest Whitaker gives a solid performance but I wished we could have seen more of him. The plot itself is pretty linear and pretty predictable,although there is a very small twist at the end that I thought was very interesting. This movie would have been much better if the main character did not need so much time to figure out what was going on. Keanu's character is in the middle of the events and still he hasn't got a clue. To me that is pretty strange. Since it was pretty obvious after the first incident. Overall ""Street Kings"" is pretty entertaining if you don't expect too much.",Street Kings
47,seymourblack-1,A Gritty & Violent Tale Of Police Corruption,7,27 April 2014,"Any story that comes from the pen of James Ellroy can reasonably be expected to feature a complicated plot, hardboiled dialogue and rogue cops. In this respect, ""Street Kings"" certainly comes up to expectations and although it's not in the same league as ""L.A. Confidential"" or ""The Black Dahlia"", this movie is, nevertheless, a thoroughly entertaining, action-packed thriller about police corruption, murders and betrayals.Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a LAPD vice detective who habitually operates by his own rules and regularly short-cuts the legal process by executing the criminals he encounters in his work. An example of this is seen when he goes undercover as a guy who wants to sell a machine gun to some Korean gangsters. The Koreans beat him up and steal his car but Ludlow simply makes his way to their hideout and shoots all four men dead before rearranging things to make it look as if they'd killed each other. He then rescues the two children that they'd kidnapped. His methods are obviously effective but not appreciated by everyone.Ludlow's furious when he hears that his ex-partner, detective Terence Washington (Terry Crews) has been informing on him to Internal Affairs Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie) and so follows Washington to a convenience store where he intends to tackle him face to face. At the store, two masked men rush in and a shoot-out ensues during which Washington is killed before the gunmen take off again. The circumstances under which Washington was killed naturally appear to be suspicious and implicate Ludlow because somehow during the mêlée, one of his bullets ended up in Washington's body and, of course, he had a powerful motive for killing his ex-partner.Ludlow is fully supported by his boss, Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker), who appreciates his work and sets about removing any incriminating evidence from the crime scene. Wander advises Ludlow to forget about what had happened and not concern himself with trying to pursue the two gunmen. Ludlow finds it impossible to do this and with the help of a young detective called Paul ""Disco"" Diskant"" (Chris Evans), tries to track down the killers. His investigation proves to be full of surprises, mainly because of the enormous amount of police corruption that he unearths along the way.Keanu Reeves portrays his character as being like a wounded animal in his behaviour. He's suffering emotionally after the death of his wife and is clearly damaged and burned-out after years on the streets where he's learnt that the only way to do his job and survive is by acting outside of the rules. In his tough-talking working environment, the only emotion he can openly express is anger and this has led him into suppressing his other feelings and self-medicating with copious amounts of alcohol to cope.""Street Kings"" is gritty, violent and full of twists with plenty of action, tension and an above average story It starts off at break-neck speed and does a good job of maintaining its momentum throughout. The most lasting impression it leaves is of the widespread corruption that's portrayed as being endemic at every level of the LAPD. For anyone who's surprised or appalled by this, the reassurance that Ludlow is given at the end of the movie (that the Department needs officers like him) will be particularly depressing, especially in view of who gives him that endorsement.",Street Kings
48,Angelus2,Street Kings delivers with some great shoot out scenes,7,15 October 2008,"Keanu plays Tom Ludlow, a cop who is willing to take out the criminals without giving them a chance to surrender. But after the killing of his partner, the thirst for vengeance takes over and he searches for the men responsible uncovering a vast conspiracy something that he is apart of.It maybe because I've seen films like this before, but I didn't quite feel the excitement, Reeves is a actor I admire and have seen some great performances from him even when everyone else said it was bad, here I felt he wasn't 100%; the jokes weren't very funny, Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie provide a satisfactory job as Ludlow's superiors while the occasional appearance from a rapper is noted. Evans was convincing as a young rookie cop trying to help his fellow officer.The shootout scene at the beginning was very good and held some grit when it was revealed what the Korean gangsters were doing, the end is also a thrilling moment when all is revealed about the killers...A good action film to watch...",Street Kings
49,antoniotierno,sad and terribly violent,6,4 July 2008,"A cop thriller reminding both ""Training Day"" and ""LA Confidential"". Location is essential to create the atmosphere of the movie, in fact everything's focused on LA dreary areas, on its least salubrious and most violent neighborhoods, so that the result is a strong authenticity. Probably Keanu Reeves was not the most suitable for this role, in spite of his talent, but he certainly didn't cut a poor figure. In addition to his decent performance, Whitaker, Evans and Hugh Laurie - back on the big screen after many years of 'Dr. House' - are not disappointing at all. The storyline is a bit predictable and conventional but the script works because the plot gets to appear cynical and to show a realistic and appealing cop-drama.",Street Kings
50,TheUnknown837-1,"a decent action picture. Nothing in it hasn't been seen before, but the filmmakers do wield it well enough to make it enjoyable and sometimes hair-raising",7,1 January 2009,"A man wakes up in the morning with a very pessimistic, worn-down, can't care about anything expression. He sleeps with a gun in his hand. He doesn't care about anything that happens to him or anybody else. Nowwhere have we seen this before? Many times, over and over again in cop movies. Basically, David Ayer's Street Kings is just a retread of what other cop-corruption movies have done in the past. But what it does is cleverly blend them all together to create a story that may not be pumped full of intelligence, is compelling enough to keep us guessing at least most of the way through.Street Kings stars Keanu Reeves as the stereotypical don't-care-about-nuthin' police officer. His wife is dead and he's often used by his boss (Forest Whittaker) for taking down bad guys. When Reeves becomes suspected in the murder of his former partner (Terry Crews), the common tales of betrayal, corruption, and loyalty come up as Reeves takes the law into his own hands, blood is shed, shells are emptied, and the whole cycle starts over again until a conclusion is reached.Yes, there is nothing in Street Kings that I call original, but then again, there are few movies these days in the early years of the 21st century that are. Hollywood seems to have lost its nerve for newer, bigger ideas and is just going back over the movies that made big bucks in the past. But Street Kings is effectively made. I really liked Keanu Reeves as the pessimistic cop, I enjoyed the other actors in their performances and roles. The action is hair-raising. The setting of a world of corruption and hatred is well realized with the script. The dialogue is oftentimes very vulgar, sometimes over the top, but that can be looked over. And like I said earlier, even though the plot elements have been used over and over again, the screenwriters wield it just write so that you'll have several guesses about what happens next or simply no idea whatsoever. So, while it's not a great movie in any regards, Street Kings is a fun, shoot-'em-up action picture with good performances and lots of adrenaline and therefore, gets a recommendation from me for members of the action movie fandom.",Street Kings

52,jaredmobarak,I'm already packedStreet Kings,6,11 April 2008,"What I love about David Ayer's work is that he is unpredictable and unafraid to tell a story in all its brutality. From his penned script Training Day to his directorial debut in Harsh Times, we are treated with bad men and worse men, doing what they need to survive and not worrying about the consequences. When I saw the trailer for his new film Street Kings, I thought I'd be in for a three-peat, but I should have looked at the writing credits. Don't get me wrong, I like James Ellroy and Kurt Wimmer, I enjoy much of their work, however, knowing Ayer's catalog makes me believe that it was their fault why I did not love this film. The aesthetic is there, the language is there, and the violence is never shied away from, but the story itself never surprises. You will be able to see what will happen straight from the getgo and unfortunately that just isn't what I'm used to seeing with Ayer. I expected more and hopefully for his next film he won't go gun-for-hire and write his own new urban street tale.Don't be fooled by the trailer, this is not a story about a corrupt cop on his day to day jaunts busting heads and covering his tracks. It's about the good cop that has lost his faith, while he may go against the rules, he will only do it for the right reasons; he hasn't gone completely off the deep end. No, it's those around him that are lost and he must find two cop killers when everyone just wants to let it go in order to save his skin. True he wants the cover up to keep his job, but he also wants justice for his ex-partner, a man he began to dislike but a man he loved and would not let die in vain. In effect, then, we are treated to a much slower paced plot then you may want as he goes out on his own to solve the case off the books. More a straightforward cop drama then a crazy shoot-em-up, we are shown this one story thread through to its inevitable conclusion. It's all tidied up with a bow, villains explain the whole plan like the old cliché goes, and we get closure. Ayer, you aren't supposed to be so cut and dry, what happened? Being such a by the numbers tale also means sacrificing a lot of character development. Roles like Naomie Harris' are throwaways, putting a name actress in a small part with no real substance. The same goes for Hugh Laurie, third billed and quite entertaining, but does his Captain Biggs have any real need to be there? You could have put any guy off the street in that role and it would have served its purpose as a MacGuffin to be explained later. And how about Common? The guy owns his five minutes of screen time; it's just a shame that is all he is allowed. Not to mention John Corbett who doesn't even get a billing on IMDb, now that's just strange.The acting is great overall though. Forest Whitaker is a bit too showy for me, but I love the guy so I give him a pass; Chris Evans is top-notch as usual, hopefully a true breakthrough role is coming for him; and Jay Mohr comes out of nowhere playing the aged Sgt. without any of his trademark wit. Even Cedric the Entertainer comes in shedding any comedic preconceptions. He plays his not-so-bad thug sounding like Terrance Howard in Hustle and Flow; I was shockingly impressed. The guy that holds it all together, though, is Keanu Reeves. I know people hate the guy, but I think he is solidly perfect here. He has the dejection and death sentence look about him, taking the kills for himself so that his partners don't have to live with the guilt. He knows what he does is wrong, but he does it because he believes he has to. Sometimes to keep the city safe, you have to bend the rules. Reeves looks weathered and beat-down here, totally believable as the cop looking to do right despite his actions. Real good stuff.So, well directed and well acted, but yet not that great? Doesn't seem to make sense, yet that's my feeling. All the good stuff tries to overcompensate for the generic, lackluster story. One thing about cinema, thoughand maybe the writers strike was worth it, even though those wanting the strike for more money were mostly the hacks, the true auteurs already get the casha good script overcomes all and a bad one cannot be saved. Unfortunately this one never goes that extra mile to be completely unique and the performances just fall into place when necessary rather than enhancing to bring the tale to new heights. If you haven't seen it yet, go rent Harsh Times, save this one for a rental in a few months instead.",Street Kings

Forest Whitaker, Hugh Larie and Chris Evans are two other well known actors, their performances along with Keanu Reeves is fantastic. The rest of the cast did solid work, bringing good performances and interesting takes to their characters, they all did.That's the premise and Street Kings covers familiar territory in terms of originality but it shines in its writing of character and story, simply fantastic and David Ayer executes it perfectly with the direction and visual storytelling. Mix that with the cinematography and how good the movie looks, you get a great crime film with lots of good character interactions and suspenseful scenes.

It is a good action thriller! It is one of my favorite best Keanu Reeves movies, I am still a big fan of him and I always enjoy this movie. I also had no idea that Chris Evans (Captain America The Winter Soldier, Avengers) started in this movie as the main support cast opposite of Keanu Reeves.

The mystery, the acting and the action in this movie is outstanding!""Street Kings"" is possibly one of the best cop thrillers in years since the likes of The Departed, Training Day, Dark Blue, and To Live and Die in L.A.! Keanu Reeves gives a very strong performance as a veteran L.A. detective who is struggling with his conscience as he deals with both delivering brutal street justice and mourning the death of his wife. Oscar winner Forest Whitaker gives another strong performance as Keanu's hard-nosed boss, whose duties include keeping Keanu within the confines of the law and out of the clutches of Internal Affairs. Hugh Laurie (TV's ""House"") was a real surprise in the movie, as he plays the captain of Internal Affairs who is out to bring down corruption in the force, particularly amongst the Vice Squad (which includes Keanu, Whitaker, and a couple of appearances by Jay Mohr and John Corbett). And Chris Evans (""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") gives a very convincing performance as a young detective who teams up with Keanu after evidence implicates the latter in the death of his ex-partner.This movie is filed with a lot of action and twists, although some were predictable it kept me interested to the end. Keanu Reeves played a good part along with Forest Whitaker who always gives a top notch performance. It is a fun flick, specially if you are Keanu Reeves fan or you like the actor. This movie was pretty good. I enjoyed it very much. great cast. good story. I know this type of Bad cop movie has been done before in different ways. Keanu Reeves did a way better job as a cop in Street Kings then he did an architect in Knock Knock. Very believable. Great camera and make-up work. there was a good part in this movie were you can feel how cold the streets could be. But for the most part it was very predictable. In this movie are two rappers in here that both plays different characters and they did a good job on acting. Even some people would not agree with me. Common as corrupt LAPD deputy masquerading as ""Coates"" and The Game as Grill. I think both did a good job playing their roles. Street Kings got a also a sequel which it sucked ass! Both of the roles Keanu Reeves passed in the sequels Speed and Street Kings. Because he knew it was a bad idea and the sequels will be a failure and they really were.Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a veteran LAPD cop who finds life difficult to navigate after the death of his wife. When evidence implicates him in the execution of a fellow officer, he is forced to go up against the cop culture he's been a part of his entire life. This is Keanu Reeves that I love and not his role in Knock Knock, this movie kicks ass!!!!!!

55,rajdoctor,Street Kings,6,16 April 2008,"I think, this movie was released simultaneously in US and Netherlands, because it did not have many IMDb reviews when I went to see the movie. I had no idea of how the movie would be? I thought it might be something to compare Keenu Reaves' Speed. I was wrong.LAPD Detective Tom Ludlow (Keenu Reeves) has his own ways of justice; he does it alone and is lethal. He is often verbally reprimanded by his team, but often protected by his boss Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker). In an incident Tom becomes the center of controversy when his fellow colleague is shot dead. Tom is transferred to a desk job, but he decides to find the killers of his colleague. Unraveling the mystery of the killers Tom opens the pandora's box of corruption in LAPD. After much action and fights Tom is finally able to kill all culprits.This is a serious movie and script, very unlike Speed where Keenu Reeves was playing a cop. Keenu Reeves has grown and matured and plays this intense angry detective. He has this blank look on his face, but with his actions we understand he must be an angry man. Forest Whitaker has overacted at times, but I think that is what the role required of him to do.The movie has some suspense  on who is the final culprit. Within 30 minutes of the movie I had guessed it and luckily I was correct in my guess. Otherwise now a day in the name of suspense, director can take us to any ending.Screenwriter turned Director David Ayer has got a tight script on hand, and he does justice in its execution. The movie is serious and heavy, with enough action sequences that may appeal to action goer audiences.Some old fallacies of movies are also there  first, our hero even though faces death, is never killed. Villains always take their own time to kill the hero  until the hero kills them, second, the villains will always become dumb and reveal their cards and their game-plan to the hero in the end, making it easier for the hero and audience to understand the motives behind the villain's plot.This is not a bad movie, but not a great movie to rave about also.

57,the-movie-guy,The police are the Street Kings and Keanu Reeves is their enforcer,8,10 April 2008,"(Synopsis) Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves), a veteran LAPD Detective, works in a Special Vice Squad Unit in Los Angeles. Ludlow has been suffering from depression since his wife died. On top of that, his former partner, Detective Terrance Washington (Terry Crews) is murdered by two gang members. Ludlow goes on a wild and reckless quest through the mean streets of Los Angeles to track them down and get justice for Washington. Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) is Ludlow's supervisor who must keep him from going over the edge and out of the cross-hairs of Internal Affairs Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie).(My Comment) Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker were excellent in playing their parts. In the first 10 minutes, we get to see how good Ludlow is in using his guns. The movie races at such a fast pace, and it is so intense at times that you don't know who is the good guy or the bad guy. There are some great shootout scenes, and whatever you do, don't get in Ludlow's way, because he will take you out. Usually, the police have this cop culture of protecting each other. After they imply that Ludlow had something to do with the murder of Detective Washington, he begins to question his loyalty to his fellow officers, especially, when they hang him out to dry. At that point the movie gets real interesting. The only problem I had with the script was that it put the tough cop Ludlow in a gloomy mood the whole movie. I would have preferred him to be a cop with self-control and strength of mind. If you enjoy cop dramas, you will like this one, because it has so many twists and turns and back stabbing to keep you interested and wanting more. You will love some of Ludlow's interrogation techniques of the bad guys. (Fox Searchlight, Run Time 1:49, Rated R)(8/10)",Street Kings

You don't always get the protagonists attitudes and the different elements of the plot aren't well articulated, which is prejudicial since the outcome and final confrontation between Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker suggest an interesting point of view but that was badly backed up by a clumsy story.Street Kings is therefore far noteworthy but Ayer will deliver, four years later, a much more accomplished cop movie on every level, End of Watch.",Street Kings

Since Serpico the idea that police who dip their hands into the cookie jar seems almost unrealistic until Keanu Reeves came to being as a cop whose wife died mercilessly at the hands of criminals. Disillusioned he becomes an enforcer for his superior to rid the streets of rival gangs or provides hits on other political bodies who might turn, and divulge sensitive material to higher powers if they feel threatened. Knowing how much his world has turned upside down Jack (Reeves) tries to reconcile with a guilt he cannot ignore any longer.Yet the hierarchy within his department finds that the risk of his turning on his own is too great, and decides to eliminate jack before he finds who was responsible for killing his ex-partner Washington. On the hunt with another head strong detective Diskant (Chris Evans) they start to unravel the mystery as to who runs the big show behind the curtains. Jack in his disbelief finds out that his superior (Forrest Whitaker) is the main target, and must put an end to the escalating nightmare.Since Serpico I found this to be a tight, and daunting tale of police corruption. Emotions run rampant in this high octane thriller as Reeves bounces from one moment of despair to another. There is never any rest as far as Jack goes seeing that he could be implicated for crimes not on the books. A great twist, and often moving around the compass of LA it was amazing he was able to keep his sanity through out. With all of the evidence pointing his way to put him behind bars for life he finally had enough of the tainted badge he was working with. The struggles to keep from breaking down must have been enormous.Wonderful story along with some great characters to add in the mix such as Hugh Laurie who more or less helped Jack alleviate some of the pressure when jack put an end to the terrorizing plot by putting a slug into his captain's chest. It is amazing that today's police can dip their hands into the jar when it comes down to survival. Pay is not what it used to be, and with druggies, and their sellers making or raking in millions a month who would miss it? The temptation is too great to just say no. With a pile of money four feet high with a few bricks of cash missing would be counted as nothing more than a mistake.I say when a bust goes down that can collect such a haul I say let the investigative police officers involved keep the money, to distribute among the other policemen in their detachment. They risk their lives all of the time. It would prove a hell of a lot better than listening to the news reports about how some police stole or acquiesced from the holding vaults. Highly recommended for viewers of this genre.",Street Kings
60,dead47548,Surprisingly quite good.,8,26 September 2008,"A pleasant surprise; I really dug it. Definitely felt like an Ellroy story and while it has a lot of twists and turns and a very intricate structure of all the corruption throughout the police force, it never got too confusing and never got so unrealistic that it distracted from the great time it was. Reeves was surprisingly very likable in the lead role and even had a few scenes that proved he can be emotional if needed, unlike the 'most wooden actor alive' persona that so many have pegged him of having. Forest Whitaker was definitely the best of the cast with an almost psychotic intensity that reminded me a little bit of his Idi Amin, especially in his final scene. A lot of people say he goes too over-the-top but I thought his theatrics were necessary for the character. The rest of the supporting cast is solid, but none of them shine too bright. I really wish Hugh Laurie had more screen time. I'd like to give a special mention to Chris Evans who had this excellent groove with Reeves once the two of them teamed up. That's pretty much it. An entertaining, gritty cop thriller that I found highly enjoyable.",Street Kings

Well alrighty then! The action here is pretty darn good. The story is engaging and you really want to see how this is going to play out and how it's going to end. For the story to be engaging is very important in these kinds of movies. You want to get to the bottom of what's going on! There are some good twists and turns. I like when you can't be quite sure who to trust or not.If you've seen a couple of Ayer-movies, you might recognize the style.As I said, I like Keanu Reeves here. I think I like him generally. There are some gun fights and in some scenes I imagined I was seeing some sort of prequel to John Wick, haha. The rest of the cast does a good job, too. We get to see a skinnier Captain America too, feels weird to see him in anything else nowadays. I like the chemistry between him and his co-actor.Now, I don't want spoil anything, because that's how I roll, so all I'll say is this: If you want to see a pretty good ""cop-movie"", you got one here.",Street Kings
62,johnnymacbest,"Tries a little too hard to be like ""New Jack City""",7,5 April 2008,"With ""New Jack City"" director Mario Van Peebles and screenwriter Thomas Lee Wright, created a fresh new take on the seedy, gritty urban crime drama, conveying its atmosphere almost realistically with a sense of verisimilitude echoing that dark era of early '90s New York. The performances from Peebles (who also stars in the film) and rapper Ice T among others brought the style to new heights. With ""Street Kings"" however, the result is a rather mixed bag of writing, directing, and performances. Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) comes off as a brooding, wannabe thug rather than a angry, tough cop. Forrest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie (of ""House"" fame) however have much better acting performances. I can't really say much about Common, The Game, and Cedric the Entertainer, other than being ""product placements"" since both are well-known in the media. But I really was surprised by Naomi Harris (28 Days Later, POTC 2&3). Her acting alone should garner her more roles in my opinion. She's beautiful, intelligent, yet somewhat distant and vulnerable but holds her own.While the action scenes in NJC were well-directed and edited, ""Street Kings"" still suffers from some clichéd, MTV-style-hyper edited action scenes that are really out of place and hampers the film in that aspect. They could've been so much better had the director established more grounded reality in those scenes or at least had a consultant on real-life situations where such unpredictable actions can occur. In fairness, some of the action is ""suitable"" but derivative.Although the film does get you to care about the characters, the writing sometimes does feel wooden and contrieved. The dramatic bits are good though, utilized to good effect in several parts, although the music is a matter of taste. Because Reeve's performance is so weak and uneven, there's no denying that this film could've been polished more in conveying convincing emotions and concerns between him and the other characters and this is largely on the director's part.""Street Kings"" is a good film, but its many problems in writing and direction makes it fall short in comparison to New Jack City. See this film. But don't expect anything more.",Street Kings
63,dilbertsuperman,Keanu posing as a dirty cop does not ring true- wooden performances all around.,5,19 September 2008,"This is a watchable yet run of the mill attempt at making a cop movie thriller using the vehicle of a dirty cop in the form of Keanu Reeves. If you want to see someone that normally plays heroes play a good dirty cop- go see Training Day instead- much better movie in similar script territory. Keanu is a pretty boy, his delivery is monotone and boring and not at all engaging as what is required from a lead. When he walks around trying to be street tough, it's hard not to laugh. Several unintentional comedy scenes because of his miscasting.PLOT: Dirty cop has a dirtier boss but is someone trying to whack him? Keanu is our streetwise cop who beats up criminals after he gels his hair properly and hits the tanning bed. This is a watchable movie about cop corruption- but not a good or a great one.",Street Kings
64,HelenMary,dark dirty complex and absorbing - cop drama gone twisted,8,5 December 2012,"After the success of Point Break and Speed, this is another cop drama for Reeves but with a difference. This is dark dirty and twisted. Reeves isn't pretty or nice in this, but he's good at what he does and does this with his normal aplomb. Reeves opposite Whitaker is a joy to watch; the chemistry between them, anti-chemistry if you will, is brilliant, but hey, Whitaker is genius in everything. He does occasionally over-act but not in this, and Reeves is smooth and scary; broken and more than a little nuts, like Johnny Utah gone very VERY bad having gone into Vice, and there are parallels between the two.The plot is clever, the writing excellent, and I won't ruin any surprises, but it's an insidious back-stabbing plot and Ludlow (Reeves) is used to do all the dirty jobs that no-one else is smart enough or daft enough to pull off, but he's got a moral streak - skewed morals of course - but you want him to come through. The necessary but in real life silly denouement of the plot when the bad guys think they'll get away with it so explain everything is actually useful to fill the viewer in on a few things. Hugh Laurie is almost funny, dry (House) humour, and it's great seeing a Brit in an all-American role, and he really does IA guy well. Chris Evans is the fresh-faced Rookie, and there's some well known faces throughout the film. Whilst Reeves and Whitaker are the stand out stars, it's quite an ensemble cast. It's fast paced, tragic really, and the twists and turns of the story leave you quite dizzy. It bears repeat watching as truth be told I didn't get all the nuances of the story the first (and second...) time and there's a lot in the plot to see on repeat watches. Ludlow sums up the film in the line (paraphrased) ""We can do what we want, we're cops, it's just a matter of how you write it up"" and herein lies the central tenet of this particular Vice Squad. The film is not easy watching, there are some pretty difficult scenes and it's certainly not one for the squeamish, language or violence-offended. Whitaker's character is just fantastic, terrifying, his ambition and power going increasingly to his morally weak head. The penultimate scene (Reeves and Whitaker) is simply stunning in it's intensity - and anyone who says Reeves is wooden after that is severely visually impaired!",Street Kings

A police thriller full of action, drama and suspense. The story about Tom Ludlow, a veteran LAPD cop who finds life difficult to navigate after the death of his wife. When evidence implicates him in the execution of a fellow officer, he is forced to go up against the cop culture he's been a part of his entire career, ultimately leading him to question the loyalties of everyone around him, is interesting but a little predictable, with some loose ends and with a lack of a closure at the end. The cast is really good, all-star actors (Reeves, Whitaker, Laurie, Chris Evans and Jay Mohr) but I feel some of the performances kinda weak. Keanu was good but with not the enough power the character needed. Forest as always excellent as the corrupt police chief, Hugh Laurie was amazing although at some moments his character reminded me to House because if his ironic way of talking.

The story is somewhat engaging.But it fails completely with the whole ""who dunnit"" thing (I don't want to give too much away). It's blatantly obvious from the very beginning who did it, so the filmmakers attempts to give the story some twists and turns in an effort to confuse the audience as to who did it are completely dead in the water. It's a shame, really. The whole movie, you're just sitting there waiting for the inevitable showdown.",Street Kings
68,cosmic_quest,Entertaining enough cop flick,6,7 May 2008,"'Street Kings' is one of the most recent films to focus on police corruption and it does handle the storyline in a reasonable manner, although there is nothing that special with the film. Set against the backdrop of a gang-ridden Los Angeles, the films centres on Tom Ludlow, a cop who isn't above breaking the law to catch (or rather, kill) the bad guys and he does so with the approval of his team captain Jack Wander and fellow cops. However, when a former friend, himself a cop, is murdered brutally, Ludlow is implicated and slowly awakens to the moralities of his actions when he uncovers a darker side to his precinct during his struggle to prove his innocence.Keanu Reeves does a good job in his role as Ludlow, successfully demonstrating the character's moral ambiguity that leaves the audience undecided on whether to cheer him on or not. Forest Whittaker makes for an excellent Wander, though we expect no less from him, while Chris Evans does well as Paul Diskant, the young cop who works with Ludlow and who thinks he understands how things work yet, next to Ludlow, only shows how naive and inexperienced he can be.The storyline wasn't meaty enough when it came to properly handling the premise of police corruption in terms of the repercussions and delving into how Ludlow became who he was (and, in turn, why he was able to pull away before becoming too caught up in the darkness). I think I would have added an extra star or two if Hugh Laurie's character-- the Internal Affairs captain who is ultimately a good guy but one who knows he has to play the game a little to catch the big fish-- had been developed more and we saw a deeper insight into Ludlow realising the implications of his actions, further developing the idea that the film tries to question over moralities, sacrifices, what makes someone 'good' and when do the good guys become the enemy.As such, while I did enjoy the film, it is ultimately just a cop action flick with plenty of shooting scenes and chases. It does entertain but 'Training Day' and 'The Departed' do better in exploring the issues 'Street Kings' touches upon.",Street Kings
69,tburke85,Street Kings A Decent Action Crime Thriller With Some Flaws,7,10 June 2009,"Street Kings is a decent crime thriller with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad. Director David Ayer does an admirable job of making this movie about cops in Los Angeles. The cast are solid in their roles including Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker, and Hugh Laurie. Chris Evans shows up for an extended appearance only to be written out before audiences can come to care about him but he still makes the best of his small part in the movie. The same can go for Common and The Game who make brief cameo roles but are believable enough as the characters they are playing which is a good thing. The rest of the supporting cast including Jay Mohr, Cedric The Entertainer, and John Corbett are good in their limited screen time. The action is well executed and the movie moves at a steady pace unlike some others out there. A few flaws the film could've improved on was a little more character development, secrets being revealed too early as to the identity of the dirty cops (dirter than Reeves character anyway), and some real suspense. Despite its flaws though Street Kings is a decent attempt at a crime thriller with some action at a steady pace and solid acting by the cast.",Street Kings
70,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"It brings nothing new, but does everything right.",7,28 November 2008,"STREET KINGS Welcome to Street Kings, the movie that sees Keanu Reeves returning to the genre that made him famous, the action/crime/thriller. And boy is it good to have him back. Whatever your opinion of Reeves is as an actor, I really think he's grown on me in recent years. This also might have something to do with the fact that the guy really doesn't make bad movies that often. Street Kings is definitely in the upper tier of his work, both in his performance and as a film.One thing that should immediately stand out to you is the size and profile of the cast, which is not short on stars. However, underneath the sea of recognizable faces is a gripping thriller with enough gunfire and blood to satisfy most fans of the action genre, as well as a compelling story to keep the crime buffs interested. We follow Reeves' Tom Ludlow, a brutal and unforgiving LAPD detective, as he works the streets of Los Angeles without rules and uses whatever force is necessary to get the job done. However, when he is implicated in a crime, he must put all he knows behind him to save his life and career.Keanu Reeves...I can't think of many actors who have played more characters that define the word 'badass' (maybe Mark Wahlberg). So what if his abilities are limited to being dark, moody, and the definition of brooding intensity? He's GOOD at it! He can play the most repulsive guy (like he does in this movie as well as Constantine), yet still come off as likable, which is why I'll finally admit that I like the guy.The massive supporting cast is headlined by Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, and everyone's favorite snarky doctor, Hugh Laurie. While Whitaker does his usual theatrical/over the top act, it really fits with his character and doesn't detract from the film. Laurie is also great in a scene stealing role as the Captain after Ludlow's badge. Chris Evans is forgettable, but not horrible. Cameos from ""The Moniker Team"", as I like to call it, are welcome additions as well. This team consists of Common, The Game, and Cedric the Entertainer. Common's cameo as an ice cold villain is memorable and almost scary. I loved him. Amaury Nolasco annoyed me once again, while seeing John Corbett in a movie was kind of weird, considering that he 'retired' a few years ago.The mood and atmosphere of Street Kings is where it gets its title. It really felt like a constant power struggle within the movie not only between the characters, but with Reeves' character as well. His character's light and dark sides both come out in the film, but the real twist is which side comes out on top in the end. The film has several twists and turns, including a somewhat predictable revelation as to who the main bad guy is, but I found that I was never bored. It is well paced and definitely entertains with some dark and dry humor here and there.With Street Kings, you've got a thriller that doesn't bring a lot of new things to the table in the 'dirty cop movie', but instead has a strong foundation in its cast and director (David Ayer, the man behind other dirty cop stories such as Training Day and Harsh Times), which shows on screen. It's one of the better thrillers this year, and is worth a look if you're into the genre.",Street Kings

However I had my reservations about this movie giving the negative reviews the critics were giving to them but I never listened to them anyhow. Street Kings reminds a bit of Training Day meets Harsh Times with a small glazing of Magum Force, and truth be told it is not bad at all. The film moves into action very quickly , things are kept out straight and simple so it easy to follow. Reeves carries him-self with the likes of Forest Whitaker and even Hugh Laurie it almost felt like that I was watching an episode of the Shield. The film was consistent with action and emotion although I felt that the ending was just overly dramatic and the romance was just too superficial. To conclude if you look some of the following things that I mentioned then Street Kings is defiantly one for you , remember this movie is not for everyone so if you don't like Reeves then don't go.

It bears some resemblance to Ellroy's ""LA Confidential"" of course, but SK is more messy.I laughed on how ""American values"" this film is. They show Detective Tom drinking so often one has to think ""he's an alcoholic"". His chief, who knows he kills lawlessly, criticizes him for this ""vice"". But we saw Ludlow rescuing those underage hostages. Then ""he's good"". How come, is he bad or good? Can he be both? And they pay script writers for this ""moral dilemma"" ... :).I would have liked Naomie Harris to play the ""female beauty"". Martha Hilgareda is OK anyway.I expected some great lines like in Training day. I know this by heart: ""Jake Hoyt: Its not so fun when the rabbit has a gun.

73,jemps918,Pretty much a variation of Training Day,6,17 April 2008,"Keanu Reeves returns to the mainstream to play Detective Tom Ludlow in the crime/drama/thriller Street Kings. As Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker)'s prodigy, he gets to operate lone-wolf style, irking the rest of his team who clean up after his maverick ways. Making matters worse is Internal Affairs Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie, better known as House M.D.), who seems to always get in the way of cops doing their jobs. Or are they, really? Seeing Laurie on the big screen is a big draw to see Street Kings, aside from seeing Reeves and Chris Evans (as Detective Paul Diskant), of course. Not because he's as pretty as the latter two, but because of the hope he'd reprise his sardonic character, albeit in cop form. This he sort of did: he made do having non-witty lines by making up for it in delivery. His first appearance in a hospital setting seemed like an homage to his hit TV series. Fellow boobtube stars Amaury Nolasco (Prison Break's Sucre) and Last Comic Standing's Jay Mohr try on different uniforms and play fellow cops.As usual, Reeves has no chemistry with his leading lady, exotic Latina Martha Higareda (as his nurse-girlfriend Grace Garcia). Having been ingrained in audience's minds as unstoppable physical forces in Speed and The Matrix, it took some adjusting, seeing him as the older vet to Evans, who did most of the running for him.Street Kings is Training Day writer David Ayer's directorial debut, and it pretty much was just a variation of his earlier effort. It ran on longer than it should, especially since the plot was already very similar to previous cop dramas. The dialogue is supposedly realistic, but the story and the action sequences we've all seen before.",Street Kings
74,joemamaohio,My Review,6,14 August 2008,"Renegade Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) doesn't follow the books - he shoots first, then asks questions later. This is the perfect thing for Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) because it's helped propel him to captain status.Things begin to go sour when Tom's former partner, Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) is about to rat him out for his illegal police tactics, but he's brutally murdered before he can do anything.Tom is a major suspect for Captain James Biggs (Hugh Laurie), and Tom begins to try to unravel the mystery behind the murder, enlisting the help of fellow Detective Paul Diskant (Chris Evans), and their leads take them to the dark side of the law.""Street Kings"" is filled with action, suspense and drama, but fails in the most important thing - caring about the main character. Tom is a drunk, he doesn't listen to authority and he doesn't do things by the book, which usually ends up in people getting killed. I didn't care if he lived, died, found out the truth or got caught up in the lie. Sure, everything else about the film was great, but that one missing element made me not care about the outcome as much as I probably should have.",Street Kings
75,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""Street Kings""",7,11 May 2008,"David Ayer wrote the script for ""Training Day"" back in 2004 then 4 years later he directs a film very much similar to Training Day: Street Kings. Yes, it still deals with corrupt cops, undercover cops, dirty cops, corrupt chief of police, the unaware protagonist and the big ""Set the evil thing straight out"" in the ending. There's still the typecast rappers as evil drug dealers and stuff. So now, we have Keanu Reeves (the most misunderstood actor of all time) as veteran detective Tom Ludlow. After his ex-partner Washington (Terry Crews, yes the guy from ""Everybody Hates Chris"") gets killed by two guys in red bandanna's, he sets his sight on the guys who killed his partner and exact revenge. The plot may have been used for the nth time in all its entirety, at least they managed to add a little more zing to it.Although I could smell the ending a mile away, actually 10 minutes into the film, I already knew who the real culprit is, the man behind it all. They will try to establish a villain in the first part of the flick but it didn't work on me. Sorry. Hugh Laurie isn't just cut out for villainous roles. The film is predictable yes but that's just about the only negative thing I'll say about Street Kings.The action is all locked and loaded. Minutes into the film we are already thrust into action when Ludlow raids a Korean hideout and owns the fools. They excellently balanced the flow of the story and the action, not surpassing one another. We have a dialog scene here, then next scene is all out guns blazing shootout, then repeat. Just like shampoo. I am also compelled to mention the brief but delightful all out fight scene between Forest Whitaker and Keanu Reeves near the end. Its like watching an episode of ""Celebrity Deathmatch"" minus the clay. Two big shot A-list Hollywood stars duking it out. Wow. That's the magic of cinema.The acting is just wow. Forest Whitaker as usual steals the scene from lead Keanu Reeves whenever the two of them are both on screen. Do not get me wrong Keanu is a great actor (yes, he IS a great actor so stay away from him detractors) but he just can't match Whitaker's intensity. If both of them were earthquakes I'll rate Keanu Reeves intensity # 10 and Whitaker intensity #10 bazillion. Chris Evans, still sporting that Hunky persona was okay and from House fame Hugh Laurie was in perfect form. I admit its really hard not to think of him as Dr. House while watching this film. Its the same case with Matthew Fox. Common was a surprise too. He only appeared for like 5 minutes only but it was 5 minutes made of gold. His creepy dialog was well...creepy.The twist was alright in my book. There couldn't have been a better twist for a gritty cop thriller like this. Street Kings may not be the most original of films but what the hell, it worked with Tarantino's films right?",Street Kings

The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.This movie is another example of why critics all over the US are being fired. They have to much control. Infrequent movie goers rely on these dumb reviews. It is simply ONE person's opinion and in most cases it is someone who has a bias of some sort. We went to see this movie and the theatre was empty.

80,TheRadiobox,Middle of the road,5,2 July 2021,"Street Kings was directed by David Ayer, written by James Ellroy, Kurt Wimmer, and Jamie Moss, and stars Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker, Chris Evans, Hugh Laurie, Common, Cedric the Entertainer, and Terry Crews. It's about an LAPD cop who's working to clear his name after being set up for another officer's death.The Plot: Ayer tends to make one kind of movie to varying degrees of success, favoring following tough guys with tougher jobs that send them on brutal and arduous paths, and that tendency continues with Street Kings. Detective Ludlow (Reeves) has just taken down a group of kidnappers without following procedure, much to the benefit of captain Wander (Whitaker) and the rest of Ludlow's team; and to the chagrin of ex-partner Washington (Crews), who has been tipping off Biggs (Laurie) of the IA. Washington gets killed in an improbable hold-up and everyone asks questions. Ludlow and detective Diskant (Evans) investigate Washington's death being connected to a man named Coates (Common) despite the case being closed. While much of the procedural element and journey to find a culprit in Washington's murder is far from original, Ayer does pace the story well and offers the occasional insight into the grime of city-based police work between more generic plot revelations.The Characters: Like many a crime movie, Street Kings sticks to archetype instead of taking a risk. Is that a commentary on the police forces of the U. S.? Possibly. What's crystal clear in the movie are its characters. Ludlow is the only one of the bunch that has something to him, even if it is just one thing. Aside from his borderline alcoholism and built up rage over the unsolved death of his wife, he's a hypocrite. He's searching for the answers to a coverup when he himself has been a part of one (probably more if some throwaway lines are true). Ludlow is a composite of the two leads from Training Day (written by Ayer), which works well in giving a complex character a chance to play the hero. All the others are pulled straight from other crime movies, with Wander the boss with history, Biggs the suspicious tail, Diskant the negotiable informant, and the criminals blank slates. Thankfully the movie sticks with Ludlow instead of the blatantly cardboard supports.The Crime: Having a morally ambiguous character as the center does help keep Street Kings afloat when it threatens to weigh itself down with cliche, but the script doesn't do much aside from providing shakedowns similar to numerous other crime stories that lead to uninspired destinations; and revelations surrounding the death of a once-crooked cop trying to go clean that can be tedious to top it off; but what Street Kings does have that elevates it is its presentation. Ayer's upbringing in South Central adds a layer of legitimacy to the proceedings, with a few volatile encounters with gang members and fellow officers alike allowing Street Kings to make its statements and bring some jolts of energy to its events. Much of the journey is predestined, but there are a couple of solid moments that manage to stand out of the mediocre majority.The Technics: Being an Ayer film, Street Kings is true to its location, never for a second failing to illustrate the setting and all of its denizens. Together with the handheld style of cinematography and Ayer's penchant for indulging the gorier details, the look and construction of the movie is one of its biggest assets. While the writing that pertains to the story and its participants is mostly unsurprising, the dialogue is never dull. Sometimes it's insanely overwrought and testosterone-filled, and other times it's close to being so organic that it feels more like improv than something planned. The formula is tried and true, and Street Kings does it justice on a technical level.For Ayer's fifth-in-a-row crime saga he offers more or less the same stuff. Street Kings is a well-made movie for sure, but the plot and characters are so flimsy that the movie can't help but be an average crime story made worse by wasting its talent.54/100.",Street Kings

82,Pratik112,A Good Movie To Watch - The Best So Far This Year,10,27 April 2008,"They rule the streets - they are the Street Kings. This movie has really made a pleasant change and one that is for the better - a good action and thriller genre movie which cannot be missed by those who like to watch such movies.A Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, who has lost his wife, finds it very difficult to navigate his life. But then, one night he is on a mission to save two Korean children who have been missing. The mission is a success and he is named a hero. But then his ex - partner comes up against him and he decides to follow him when he is killed in an armed robbery. This forces him to go against the so - called ""cop"" culture"" and he begins to question loyalties of everyone around him.Written by James Elleroy and Kurt Wimmer, the movie stars Keanu Reeves, Forrest Whittaker, and Hugh Laurie and is directed by David Ayer.Its good to see Keanu Reeves back in action along with Forrest Whittaker, who is remembered for his role as Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland."" This movie has brought back the nostalgic times of watching good action and thriller movies regarding ""cops"" and one which has action from the very beginning till the end and is able to keep you glued to the screen. Yes! It does have a lot of swearing and a lot of blood but that is a part of this movie. But never the less it is a movie that is worth while watching.",Street Kings
83,athena24,Ayer and Ellroy Recycled plot.,6,29 April 2012,"--- MINOR SPOILERS ---Ten minutes into the film it started to remind me Dark Blue. After seeing the people involved, I knew why. Though it's a different movie, the plot has its similarities and most of the characters in Street Kings have they parallels in Dark Blue.The cast is awesome. This is actually the best thing about Street Kings. Except some of clichéd phrases, the dialogs are fine. The plot is crippled, though. There are some interesting moments, but mostly it's a linear plot of beating up bad guys, and extracting info from them. On the other hand, the bad guys appear to be too sloppy when it comes to killing Reeves' character. They make all the possible and the impossible mistakes. It makes the plot to look foolish. If the director/writer want the main character to win, they should stop setting him up in situations, where his win depends on others awkwardness plus tons of chance. It can be forgivable if it happens once, but couple of times is too much. This is supposed to be believable.The action is there. It's not the essence of the movie. The opening scene was fine. Beyond that, I think it's quite casual.",Street Kings
84,tubby1,Training Day 2,6,14 July 2009,"Street Kings is very much like David Ayer's Training Day except it is not as suspenseful, and seems to regurgitate many elements from this impressive film.The screenplay is very good and it feels very gritty and real. However, it is obvious early on how the film will progress and indeed end which is a real shame.Forest Whitaker is Wanderer and plays him with real panache (very much like Denzel Washington in Training Day). Hugh Lawrie is the most mis-cast character, he really does not come across well as Detective Biggs, so much so that he makes little impact when he is on screen, and how is accent is deemed acceptable I do not know.For all its realism, it fails to identify itself from other corruption crime films, and the end really is to clear to push this beyond a satisfactory experience.",Street Kings

87,robertallenandersonjr,One of the best cop movies ever,9,13 April 2008,"Street Kings was one of the best cop movies their are in my opinion. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I really wanted to give this movie an A+ and 10/10 but I can't. Their was just not enough action. pretty much all the action came toward the end of this movie. It was pretty entertaining through the whole movie. I think that their was just to much planning and talking. The whole middle pretty much had no action. Their was more of a story to it. The story was very good but seemed a little bit mixed up and confusing. When you see this you really have to follow it a lot. It is one of those movies you have to pay attention to. Watch for every single last detail in the movie. Each seen in the movie turns out to be pretty big at the end. You will be really surprised who is a bad cop and who turns out to be good. I think that they could have made it a little bit better. It does get you really pumped up though. During the movie you find yourself like yelling a little bit. It even had some pretty funny parts in it as well. The trailer to this movie had some good music, but in this movie there was no music pretty much. I was expecting some good music but their was really none. Now to get onto the cast. It was very well choose by the director. I think they found the perfect cast. They all played amazing parts and did great jobs. They made it really realistic. Chris Evans pretty much had little screen time. Keaunu Reeves did a great job in this as well. I think that he pretty much stole the show from every one though. He pretty much was in each seen. Forest Whitaker did another great job. This was probably his best movie yet. He made his part very realistic. He was very fun to watch in this movie. Hugh Laurie did a great job as well surprisingly coming from a T.V. show. This was just very entertaining and had some extreme action scenes. Their was a ton of blood in this movie in a couple different scenes. The messages were pretty much aimed toward cops. It showed people that their are crooked cops out their in the world. Some of the camera shots and visuals were pretty cool. I liked some of the shots on Keanus car he drives the whole movie. Overall this was a very slick action thriller. Go see it and enjoy it.",Street Kings
88,ereinion,Flawed but satisfying,7,31 December 2012,"This is a sort of Keanu Reeves' comeback flick. After The Matrix trilogy ended, he was in a number of unsatisfactory, mediocre works, such as ""Constantine"", ""The Lake House"" and ""Thumbsucker"". This role is rather strange to him, playing a down-on-his-luck detective, a loose cannon who lives from day to day. And considering that, he does a good job. Only problem is that, aside from Forrest Whitaker, there aren't any other equally capable actors here and some are quite annoying as well. Chris Evans, of The Fantastic Four fame, tries hard but fails as the serious and dedicated sidekick det. Diskant. Of other notable appearances there is the rapper The Game, who is at least authentic in his part.I was rather surprised by this film. I must say I didn't expect much from it, but it turned out to be a rather satisfactory film-noir thriller. Reeves might not look his part but he acts it. It is also flawed because of the way everyone is either good or bad, nobody is in between. Reeves' character at first seems to be in between but later turns out to be a typical hero. What else can I say? A little, pleasant surprise and a movie that probably salvaged Keanu's career, at least for the time being, after a string of misfired efforts.",Street Kings
89,Timofey1980,Great movie.,10,4 May 2021,"The Los Angeles police officer had never in his life considered what might be waiting for him outside of his own cozy world. However, with the death of his beloved wife, a dark, merciless, desperate emptiness enters his life. Ludlow is forced to act when his own fellow soldiers accuse him of murder. Thus begins the struggle of man for his place in the world, which is increasingly controlled by external forces.",Street Kings
90,C-Younkin,Explosive entertainment,8,12 April 2008,"""Street Kings"" definitely has the street-cred. Keanu looks real bad-ass, Forrest Whittaker looks like he's digging back into the character he played on ""The Shield"", writer director David Ayer is no stranger to life on the cop circuit, having written ""Dark Blue"" and ""Training Day among others, and the movie also brings on the token rappers for good measure in Common and The Game. But does it work? Reeves plays Tom Ludlow, a Vice detective on a Special Forces unit in LA, led by Ludlow's friend and former partner Captain Wander (Forrest Whittaker). Ludlow's a dirty cop, but he feels in a good way. He'll execute and then tweak the crime scene if it means taking the low-lifes off the streets for good.His former partner Terrance Washington (Terry Crews) doesn't see it that way though, as he is in the midst of ratting him out to the head of Internal Affairs, Captain Biggs (Hugh Laurie). When he finds out, Tom follows Washington around, walking right into a convenience store robbery where Washington is gunned down execution style. Wander tells Tom he'll take care of it, but Tom is a man who values justice more than anything. He partners with a homicide detective named Diskant (Chris Evans) to follow the evidence and solve the murder.The movie, by David Ayer, couldn't be more hard-core. It's filled with riveting gun-battles and fights and it's a movie not afraid to show some real brutal violence and blood. The verbal exchanges between characters are also exceptionally written, heated and intense with a good ear for dialogue. My favorite line by far this year is ""Why don't you do the department a favor and clean your mouth out with a buck-shot."" And the story pulls off a compelling morality play, sending Tom up a ladder of murder and corruption, and at the same time, climbing him further toward his own redemption. Sure, you can probably see the ending coming if your paying close enough attention, but think about it, the movie couldn't end in a better way.This is the kind of movie Reeves is excellent in, giving his character edge and toughness but also never losing track of the character's underlying moral dilemma. Whittaker is also incredible in this movie, sinking his teeth into a character who's basically portrayed as ""The Godfather"" of LA. Hugh Laurie shows up every once in a while, the character feels underwritten though. Chris Evans does a decent job, Cedric The Entertainer and Jay Mohr are nice additions who add some comedy, and it's a small role but Naomie Harris deserves a shout-out for playing the down-to-earth voice of reason character.""Street Kings"" is hard-nosed, gritty film-making. The cast is right on the money, the writing and direction is terrific, and the action couldn't be more exciting. The year is still young but this is one of my favorite films so far.",Street Kings
91,MrVibrating,Another Ayer movie,7,7 June 2008,"Ayer doesn't disappoint, but doesn't excel; Street Kings is a good movie and little else. Comparisions to his other movies are inevitable.The characters are better overall than in his previous movies, but we sure miss Christian Bale's dark and brooding profile whenever Keanu opens his mouth. The supporting cast feels a lot more real than Reeves, who never the less manages to pull the movie along. Forest Whitaker chews some scenery, and Hugh Laurie is very underused. Common and the Game are more like cameos than real parts.The music is very nice, a dark brooding electronic/industrial thing that really sets the tone. The camera-work has gotten better and obviously more expensive with vast heli-zooms over the city.The dialog is more held back and not as over-the-top as Harsh Times, probably because of the two other screenwriters helping out. There is local colour in the language, but it doesn't feel stereotyped or overdone. The plot is nothing special, a little twisty and requiring of attention, which is good. It's not a pure action-movie, it's more dark drama with violence intertwined.All in all, Street Kings is a solid 7/10.",Street Kings

93,lopcar1993,One of the best crime dramas of the decade!!,7,3 August 2009,"Sometimes in Cinema we see things that get repeated over and over and over again so many times that when something new and fresh comes along, we turn the other cheek because we instantly think that it's going to be the same thing done over.. again. But that's not the case with Street Kings. No Street kings is fresh and exciting and puts a whole new spin on the corrupt cop story that makes this film one of the best crime thrillers to come out since The Departed and Goodfelleas, this film follows a winding and snakish path down one back alley of corruption after another. I wouldn't exactly call it original or anything groundbreaking but this film had a great story to tell and in the short time it had it told it well.Keanu Reeves(In his finest hour.) plays corrupt veteran vice detective Tom Ludlow, Ludlow isn't corrupt to further his own career, no Ludlow does it so he can put the criminals where they belong. Which in m book makes that pretty good reason. See the film tries to tell us that one man out of a whole unit is righteous and as the story unfolds in front of you it seems very true that Ludlow is the only good hearted corrupt cop in that unit.I liked this film, I liked the premise and I loved the plot but the one thing that I didn't like was the fact that the whole movie was only 1hr. 47min. long, that was the only let down about the whole film. But besides it all this film delivers an entrancing and very entertaining thrill ride you've just got to see to believe.Street Kings is near-perfect in almost every way imaginable the story is bullet-proof, the acting is very good it's not great but it's very good. The premise is great and everything in the film works amazingly and it's story is told with lightning fast accuracy ad great pacing that let's the story unfold before you piece by piece and then in the end it blows you away.All in all Street Kings is a force to be reckoned with and it's a film that should be given a chance because you never know, you might actually like it.",Street Kings
94,jasontheterrible,Trashed by critics when first released,10,28 July 2018,"They hated the way the main character, played by Reeves, was so violent. The movie also portrayed the cops in LA as racist. The truth is, blue collar guys have always jumped on each other for anything and everything; race, gender, gay, straight, Irish, ugly, dumb, or whatever. It was always a bonding ritual, and no one cared. But writers have never worked in the real world, and they do not know how real men in just about every blue-collar job talk to each other. Every ethnicity does it as well. This is by far the best Keanu Reeves film I have ever seen. It was super exciting, visceral, and realistic. The ending is a big surprise and the best part of the film, though I found it all entertaining after the beginning. The beginning was off-putting just because we never get to see the real, gritty tension that exists in some cities, especially big cities. No one makes Serpico anymore, or The French Connection type films. When I first saw it in the theaters I was pretty taken by it, but the reviews were so awful I figured I was mistaken. Now I realize I have nothing in common with those puddles of poo and I no longer give a crap what the critics think.",Street Kings
95,beregic,bloody violent but with a point,10,28 May 2008,"in point form; i miss Christian Bale as this feature seems made for him, however i think that Keanu Reeves does at least a decent job(there are plot parts that Require naivety and he definitely has the looks of)still Russell Crowe might have had been the ideal choice here, i think...i absolutely love the soundtrack ; comes pretty close to Klaus Badelt original musical scores with ""faithless""/""massive attack"" touches here and there. the camera work is exceptional; no nonsense cartoon shootings like in the most recent ""shoot them up"". the dialogs are at least engaging and i KNOW i will be watching this production in the future, if get the time to do so again.i am a fan of Cedric the Entertainer, Amaury Nolasco(my fav. actor and character in ""prison break""),Forest Whitaker and nevertheless of ""common"", one of the few rappers well known for his social oriented lyrics this days. and lets not forget the awesome ""dr.house"" or """"House M.D."" protagonist,Hugh Laurie that brings here as well his well known style of hereditary ""grumpynes"" awaking the known sympathy levels(he is fantastic here for real ...""you go cry to daddy?""hahaha).unexpected comic relief moments that do not seem to take away the serious aspects of the plot itself. coming to think of it this is a great blend of ""brand"" actors and ""sezonal"" ones))).the ending that some say ""it is up in the air"" i find it no less then perfect in its realist content, could not have asked for a better one.regardless this movie is not for everyone, certainly not for the men in ""office"".the political implications are great and ""in your face"".kudos to David Ayer, he did not let down my expectations.)))read some of the critical reviews towards how ""impossible"" the police corruption could be, and how violent this feature is,etc. i have to ask the question of how come this people do not say the same when it comes to the brutality in Iraq...never mind that, can anyone give me an example of a bigger then average American city(and not only), where there was never a case or ""two"" regarding police corruption? that IS the reality . having corruption in ""interal affairs seems ""impossible"" and far-fetched!?...for god's sake, there are all types of corruptions, even in the OVAL OFFICE, for example just look the way the contracts for ""rebuilding"" Iraq have been distributed and to WHOM based on their internal-corrupt relations.it is a great story that strikes close home ,as how any individual could be manipulated and be part of ""it"" without necessary knowing so. the disturbing part to all this is very simple question as of ""why?"", or ""what for?""... well known the saying ""power corrupts"", but how one can corrupt the power itself and be a threat that need be removed, not out of compassion or ethical reason(S), but because of a ""threat"" to the ""ladder""....i am not talking about the regular cop everyone sees on the street, they likely do just what they been told to in most instances,just like within any other chain of command. and most times those ""little guys"" do not have the idea themselves of what laws exactly they might be upholding or NOT. even this days, to become a policeman still requires ONLY a grade 12 . if a ""mob"" character seems always so ""uneducated""(street smart at best), why is so hard to believe the same for a cop!? do not forget that united states has the BIGGEST prison population per capital in the whole word.there are 1 in 8 Americans that have done jail time, and this is an information that no ""official"" would deny, but at same time will not bring it in the spotlight either. therefore this type of movies like ""hars times"", ""traning day"",etc have generally very well defined purpose in bringing to light at least some aspects of why things are as such. everyone has an ""inner criminal"" side , just human condition, BUT the question is how the social norms and ethics are APLLYED in order to create accepted rehabilitation.i want to remind you that only in north America a criminal record could be deleted as long as one is willing to pay hard money in order to do so...and from WHERE those funds coming? likely another criminal activity/infraction to pay for the ever increasing police wages. how a cop can loose his job?...by DECREASING the level of crime which obviously can never happen once you have a well ""estblished"" police force passed on from ""father"" to ""son""(""we own the night comes to mind"" a very racist and ignorant ""vintage"" cop movie in my opinion).ever more increasing crime levels with ever expanding police force and especially prisons.",Street Kings
96,stebird,Corruption goes straight to the top,7,14 November 2017,"We've all heard the age old story of corruption within the police force, well ""Street Kings"" takes that story and sets it ablaze..., fair dues the story itself was somewhat predictable, but just because you know the destination you're heading to, doesn't mean the journey can't be fully enjoyable.The protagonist, Detective Ludlow, is a man on a mission, his mind scrambled by the recent death of his beloved wife, he pulls no punches even when he becomes embroiled in the framing of a police officer's murder, Ludlow sets out to uncover the mysteries that are haunting him. You could label ""Street Kings"" as just another crime film with Keanu Reeves inserted into the lead role, but it's more than that, Reeves showcases high standards of acting ability and makes you feel empathetic towards his poor detective character. The supporting cast features some real heavy hitters, most notably Forest Whitaker as Captain Wander, head of Detective Ludlow's unit, from the very beginning there was a sense that something was not quite right with this character, but any clues as to his real motives were expertly kept under wraps until the time came for him to reveal his true colours.A young, pre-Captain America Chris Evans showed real credibility and talent as Detective Diskant, a partner of sorts for Ludlow, who's natural demise came later in the film than I thought it would, giving the young actor some extra exposure and screen time, which he duly lapped up. Yes ""Street Kings"" is quite racist and incredibly tongue in cheek but that just adds to the realism, helping to flesh the film out and give it an added dimension, if you are easily offended by certain things then I'd definitely avoid this film.The presentation was dark and disturbing, illustrating the underbelly of LA perfectly..., the tones and colours chosen were apt and even during the daylight hours there was a sense of darkness in the air, painted onto the screen by a perfectly qualified cinematographer and art department, kudos to them..., drawing you further into the story and making the mystery more intriguing.Alas my final note is to say, not an exceptional film, but a fine film that will keep you gripped until the end, enjoy!",Street Kings
97,tanelteder,"dr. House is king in the hospital, not in the street",6,9 March 2011,"In this movie you find lots of killing, blood, dirty language, tough guys etc. Almost everything you look from a good action film. But I must admit, it fell short. The story about a veteran cop who doesn't hesitate to put the bullet into the gangster's body and his corrupted detectives and chiefs, is quite interesting to follow. You can still foresense the ending though. Hey, but if you still wanna see a good cop movie, where a tough guy owns everybody, then go ahead. You get what you expect.There are lots of interesting actors here. Rappers and other subject fields representatives. Keanu Reeves plays a tough veteran cop I was talking about earlier. He is pretty good. He has similar characters before and these roles suit him well. The greatest cameo is from Common, who leaves the impression that he actually is and hard-ass gangster is real life too. Forest Whitaker is a police chief. dr. House, I mean Hugh Laurie, is not. It was weird to see such a charismatic British actor who'll always be remembered as dr. House, playing a statement-making police chief in a Hollywood movie.

98,Red_Flag,Keanu Reeves is king of the street. But he's still jester of the big screen.,4,8 June 2008,"The Matrix was brilliant. Everybody knows that. So its proof that the less talking Reeves does the better his acting talents are. I'm sure in some dark corner of the world there is someone who believes Reeves is a very talented actor and although I don't like to discredit opinion I'm afraid their sorely wrong. At least here he has acting legend Forrest Whittaker to help him out providing more than enough charisma for both of them.With would have been great if the movie could stand on its own. With a paper thin plot and characters that lack likability and interest Street Kings barely makes an impact on its audience. It's brave enough to entertain somewhat with it bringing up racism and working as a policeman isn't quite as brilliant as it's cracked up to be but the payoff is rubbish not to mention the underwhelming ending. If you go see Street Kings for one reason make it be for Whittaker. My advice forget news about its crafted sophistication.Street Kings is as good as an example of the overused new media as anything showing on MTV. Lacking in style. It does manage to be gritty and is clearly not afraid to get dirty but none of that matters once the plot starts doing somersaults and falls flat on its face in an obvious attempt to inject originality into a worn premise. Street King is no snooze fest but its lacking in anything that makes me feel it should merit a review higher than a two.It's also a great shame the Mr Reeves must be seen in every goddamn scene without fail making it almost impossible to come with, the guy cant act.The story goes that as LA deadliest cop who isn't afraid to play dirty (Reeves) is under investigation after he is seen at the scene of the murder of a former colleague. He makes it his mission to find out who did this but how do you know when you've gone too far, seen things your weren't meant to see. All of this leads up to a less than explosive conclusion that manages to combine tension with action, shame then that five minutes later it all seems worthless. Reeves keeps the same straight guy tone throughout meaning there s little to no humanity or reliability to hang on too.Don't think just because i don't like Keanu Reeves that means I gave Street Kings a bad review. Even if they cast somebody like rising talent Ryan Philippe who is one of my favourite new actors. Street Kings would still stink.My recommendation? Go see the highly anticipated ""In Bruges"" for some real action and dark humour not to mention some massively likable characters. Basically its everything this film fails to be and while there are some memorable sequences and some damn good acting (Whittaker) there's very little for me recommend here. It's probably best off you keep your distance from this dull and uninteresting cops and robbers film. There's hundreds just like it so you're not missing much anyway.",Street Kings

He also rarely follows regulations, and has been known to beat information out of suspects.In fact, his unit is known for covering up for all their wrong-doings, including the unit's commander (Forest Whitaker), who has taken ""Ludlow"" under his wing.After saving two girls from kidnappers, and covering up what really happened, ""Ludlow's"" former partner (Terry Crews) goes to internal affairs, which opens an investigation on ""Ludlow."" When he hears about the investigation, ""Ludlow"" goes to confront his former partner in a corner store, only to get involved in an apparent robbery, but witnesses the two suspects hunting down the whistle-blower, and shooting him to death.Eventually, ""Ludlow"" becomes a suspect in a shooting, and has to clear his name.Yet another B movie recommended by Yahoo Movies. There is lots of action, a lot of violence and blood and mediocre character development.Reeves performance is not the best. In fact, I would have to say that it's an 80 out of 100%. He seems uncomfortable at times in some scenes, and it effects his performance.I was not impressed with the supporting cast. Many of which was poorly written. Whitaker does an excellent job as a guy who thinks he can put anybody in his pocket -- including superior officers to him.There is a whole lot of plot twists, which are not spaced out well if you ask me. They come a bit too close to each other at times. In fact, they come so close together at times that it gets a bit confusing as to where the film is going.If you are into action, this movie will make you happy. You get a whole lot of gun-play. However, a word of warning, there is a lot of blood. And when I mean a lot of blood, you get to see the results of a bullet strike on the body of it's target. The blood flows a lot in this one.The soundtrack is completely forgettable in this movie. With all the action, I don't remember hearing any songs or instrumentals at all as the movie progressed.If you are desperate to see a movie, wait until you find this on HBO or on the Free Movies section of your On Demand service.",Street Kings
107,gbx06,"Good Cop, Baaad Cop",5,16 June 2008,"The movies about policemen are always the same. We have on one hand the bad guys, corrupt policemen who in one way or another have managed to hide behind the system to enrich themselves through illegal businesses and shady dealings with the worst traffickers or thieves of that place. On the other hand we have the policeman or policemen that tired of the system, either because they are rookies or because they have decided to rebuild their lives, they decide to confront the bad guys always with favorable results.It has always been like that and we have seen this over and over in movies, with different packaging (actors, time and locations) but always with the same result. And this time was no exception. Even when David Ayer had achieved a great job with ""Trainning Day (script)"" and even when the screenplay of Street Kings was made in base and with help of James Ellroy (for me one of the most important writers of the genre) is not for nothing a reflection of what that could have been.The film is slow and predictable most of the time, in fact who have read the first paragraph of this comment could intuit the whole plot, plus the poor performance of Keanu Reeves, nobody believes the character and what is worse he doesn't have the charisma necessary to identify with his values. On the other hand is a waste to have Forest Whitaker and not to exploit fully his qualities as actor and just put him as a neurotic-irascible captain.All I can say is that with the combination of talents that this film had I hoped to see more on screen and the only thing that I received was another silly film about policemen vs policemen.",Street Kings
108,DaveDiggler,Kings of Crap,2,21 April 2008,"Street Kings"" is an over-the-top, unrealistic portrayal of corruption within the police force. Setting it in LA is the only way to make a film with such ambition of distorting reality even possible. LA is heavily diverse with all kinds of people which is a good backdrop for racism and more importantly racist cops. LAPD is also a place where the police have been scrutinized and publicly shamed for involvement in corruption that resorts anywhere from murder to police brutality to not paying for coffee. And in the one track mind of David Ayer who hit it big with ""Training Day""- which was a much better film, but also terribly flawed as well- just can't seem to get away from showing cops in a extremely negative light. Here he basically rips off his own film again- see ""Harsh Times"". The good thing about ""Training Day"" was Ethan Hawke's character. He was a good cop under the wing of a corrupt cop. There was a good and evil battle there. Keanu Reeves is supposed to be that good guy, but he's a veteran of 18 years and he has quite a history of corruption. Right from the first scene of the film he's puking because, naturally, he's an alcoholic due to the death of his wife. A lot of cops are alcoholics so it's only natural for the main character, once again, to be an alcoholic in a David Ayers film. Then he goes and buys little airplane bottles of Vodka- three of them- chugs them down, then proceeds to make a routine sell to a couple of Asians who are looking to buy a Machine gun. These Chinese (Or whatever they are) are the guys he's looking for in a kidnapping of two missing persons. Ludlow (Reeves) goes on a racist tirade about their looks and then they follow that up by beating the crap out of him. Only then does he tack them down and kill them all. That's what he does: He kills people. No warning, no police procedure of any kind, he's merely a vigilantly with a badge; a cowboy in the mold of Jon Wayne.The writing in this film is terrible. It's not even close to realistic and it paints a picture of corrupt cops who own the streets through fear and intimidation- they act the same way as the criminals do. Oh, you've seen that done before? Naturally you come across guys who cover up, set up, spree kill, kill other cops, get involved in drugs, and pretty much any kind of corruption you can think of in about a span of five days. This is made routine in an Ayers film which was okay the first time around. Now it's getting out of hand and it makes his previous films look even worse because we now see where Ayers wants to take this subject: No where. Ayers packs years and years of police corruption into weekend retreats as if it's an everyday routine: A casual drug deal here, an everyday spree killing there, and the usual torture-thing over here. This stereotypical technique of painting all cops evil is not unlike ""Training Day"" or ""Harsh Times"" where reality is not needed. You don't notice how bad of a writer someone is until they prove to you that they can't create a character that's three-dimensional or, more importantly, different. Ayers can't provide drama. He has to put his characters in the most extreme circumstance every five minutes because, when he doesn't, his films get boring with tedious everyday interactions that just don't work because they're not in any way, shape, or form realistic. If these cops aren't corrupt they're aspiring to be corrupt. The forgettable cast and the forgettable plot will probably leave smarter audience members with the same feeling I had. If I could tell Ayers something I would tell him this: ""Stop beating your stupid message that corruption exists within the police force to ad nausea levels that only a Paul Haggis could rival!! Stop it!! You don't like cops! Great, got the picture."" Ayers showed promise as a writer. Now he shows that he can't come up with a single original idea as his films stand on clichés, coincidence, and exaggeration. He adds nothing new that hasn't already been done- even by him. ""Street Kings"" depends on coincidence to drive the plot, such as a chase scene where a suspect runs through the neighborhood as Ludlow drives around the streets to find him (I think I've seen that before and if Ayers makes another movie I bet I see it again). Naturally, Ludlow is waiting for him and he throws something at his legs- looked like a chair, I wasn't paying much attention since I already knew what was going to happen- which takes the suspect off his feet as he falls into a barbed wire fence. This will also give Ludlow the opportunity to torture him by pulling him against the wire so it cuts into his skin. The man pleads for help as he thrives in pain, then gives in. Ludlow get's his answers. Not a single original idea is created. It's a work of dreadful perfection. The acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the writing is so bad it should have never been written let alone pitched, read, and then made. How did Forest Whitaker get himself involved in this? It's hard to even imagine his performance from ""The Shield"" compared to this hammed up, pay check cashing snooze fest. Of course he wasn't out done by Keanu Reeves and that one guy who pops in mediocre roles for some odd reason in big budget films. That dude's best acting performance came in ""Not Another Teen Movie."" Maybe you remember him? No? Me neither. They both were upstaged by Whitaker which shows that Forest can be a better actor than Reeves and the other guy without even trying- or at least he doesn't look to be trying.",Street Kings
109,imdb-23821,Sometimes ridiculous story with great cast that sells it,7,16 August 2021,"How often do you get Keanu Reaves, Forest Whitaker, Chris Evans, Hugh Laurie, Cedric the Entertainer in one film among others? While the script sometimes borders along the ridiculous and cringeworthy (I just wanted you to have this (smoking gun)... LOL), it's very well sold by Reeves and the rest of the cast.In short here is the stock story. Reeves is the Dirty Harry of his generation. But he had a falling out with his partner who went totally clean and resents Reeves because... it's a movie and he saw the light of being straight and is now trying to get Reeves in trouble with Internal Affairs for going above the law. Or is he? Reeves goes to a store with a robbery about to happen in progress when it's really a hit. But the video will put Reeves in question about what he was doing there while 2 gunmen with machine guns murder his former partner. Reeves will need to navigate IA, other cops, the dangerous drug underworld to find out who the killers are.If you can overlook some silly parts, it's a fun, cliched but well acted with a great cast and does maintain some credibility and plenty of suspense. Not great but certainly better than average and certainly better than modern tripe.",Street Kings

111,yourmotheratemydog715,It's Good... But Not Great By Any Means,6,29 August 2008,"""Street Kings"", 2008 There's nothing particularly amazing about ""Street Kings"", other than the fact that Keanu Reeves can make it through 2 hours without changing facial expressions. But, the movie as a whole isn't that bad, either. Just average.The film follows Tom Ludlow, a LAPD cop played by Keanu Reeves. After getting extremely mad at his ex-partner, Terrance Washington, he follows him to a supermarket, only to see him brutally murdered by two gang members. But the Captain (Forest Whitaker) thinks that if they release certain info on the shooting, people will blame Ludlow. So, Captain decides to let it all go and not arrest the gang members. So, Reeves gets angry and decides to track them down and get justice. So, in other words, another ""gritty cop drama"".The first thing one will notice about ""Street Kings"" is that it has a surprisingly high amount of good actors in it. I was immediately turned off when I saw Common and The Game (please stop trying to act, rappers) on the cast list, but for every dumb rapper trying to make it big in Hollywood, there's about three talented actors. Plus, you get to see Cedric the Entertainer and Jay Mohr try to handle dramatic roles! I've never been a fan of Keanu Reeves, however, and this movie didn't change my mind about him. I don't know if he just doesn't know how to act, if he's just playing his roles ultra serious, or if he actually lacks the ability to show any facial expressions. He goes through the entire movie with a blank, slightly angry look on his face. Ever so often, his face becomes a little angrier. Nothing else. It was quite strange, especially when all the supporting cast crack smiles and jokes left and right.I'm not a big fan of the ""gritty cop drama"" genre, mostly because they all seem to be basically the same movie. There's usually not much original ideas to differentiate one from another. I can't say that this one is original, either, but I actually cared about the plot for about the 70-80 minutes of it. The plot line was really quite engrossing, something I wasn't really expecting from it.If I have one gripe about the plot, it's that there are FAR, FAR too many ""twists and turns"". It seems like everyone in the movie switches sides at least once during the movie, and it's quite hard to remember where everyone stands. Sometimes it even seems like they're on the good side, yet Keanu still decides to kill them. It gets rather confusing ever so often.There really isn't that much negative to say about the movie, other than the awful dialogue at times, but there's not much really positive to say about it either. It's just another movie that will come and quickly be forgotten, because there's nothing that special about it. It's entertaining, I'll give it that, and I'll give it a mild recommendation, there's just nothing really special about it.So, I'll give it a:7 out of 10 (Recommended)",Street Kings

113,kjruk,Awful,5,1 February 2013,"A Hollywood LAPD is by definition an alcoholic, divorced, anguished, mentally unstable, emotionally suffering, even close to being psychotic. And its hard to tell the difference between him and the bad guys. And what a filthy dump he lives in on such low pay you wonder why he bothers. Every cliché in the Hollywood book is in this film. The opening is even more ludicrous than usual as the lone ranger single handedly and at some risk to his life sets up the bad guys and then exterminates them one by one and thats OK cos they are very bad guys. No police procedures followed by this cop. Even Dirty Harry never quite went as far as this to ignore all rules and morality except his own. He's so unpleasant it's not surprising the other cops hate him. So do I. He's a psychotic moron who should not be a policeman. Oh yes and he fills himself with vodka and drives on duty. Great examples for gullible youth. And nowhere near reality. And so it goes on. Ridiculous. If it had some of the humour of an Arnie or Clint character it might be OK but it's deadly serious!

114,madonnawb,don't waste your money.... simply re-watch the Training Day....,5,16 April 2008,"I really liked Training Day and actually hoped Street Kings would be as half as decent. Too bad I also didn't know Street Kings was written/directed by the same guy as the Training Day making it a sure set up for a disaster. Why on earth would he even think he can pull off another cop thriller is beyond me (more money perhaps?) but there I was, unfortunately watching the consequences of it. The story is more than predictable - tough cop Keanu with plenty of issues of his own gets involved with the big boys and the cover-up of something dirty within the LAPD. (Wow, what a creative plot, I'd drawn in already) On his side he has his Captain (Forest Whitaker) who also seems to be above the law and definitely overacting the remnants of his role in the Last King of Scotland (another annoying minus for the movie). Through series of unfortunate events and with his badge on the line, Keanu has a change of heart and goes after the hand that feeds him willing to uncover who was behind a murder of one of his old partners Det. Washington and why. The whole change of heart seemed rather unlikely and we never get to really know Keanu's character or how this twist happens. But for all intensive purposes of the plot it does, and within 45 min into the movie, we already know all the answers: why the murder and the cover-up (laundering of the dirty money aka operation cookie-jar) and we know who's behind it all (the only person who has all the power in the movie: Captain Forest Whitaker). The End. But no, sadly you are forced to sit through another 50 minutes pretending something different might happen. But it doesn't. After bunch of silly twists and turns, lots of gun action and near-death experiences, Keanu finally learns what the audience already knew: the Captain is behind it all. He shoots the bad guy, cleans off his name and yes, gets to go back home to a sexy girl. Awww... if that's just not the perfect feel-good movie, then I dunno what is. Yeah Hollywood, you've done it again- another pointless movie for the masses!",Street Kings

116,taifunu,it's not what it looks like,8,21 April 2008,"first of all, must say that this is a movie that benefits from - and actually needs - a second viewing. at least. maybe even a third. then, in order to fully understand it it helps doing some homework. I know I did. read almost all Ellroy's novels. Watched almost everything Ayer wrote. and also his previous movie Harsh Times. there are a lot of influences in this movie. after all, this is the post-modernist age...or are we leaving that one behind as well ? anyway...the first thing that 'hits' you as you sit in the theater chair is the score . it just blends in with the images, as if it's organic. it just insinuates itself in your ears, wraps you around...and you're caught. and don't even know what happened. The movie It's not a masterpiece, it's not gonna redefine the history of cinema. But it's a well made, well-thought movie. It's not just another cop movie ; it's not ""the poor man's LA Confidential"" as someone wrote . If it were to be defined in such terms, I'd say it's ""LA Confidential"" and ""White Jazz"" ( the novels ) mixed, stirred, not shaken ( or was it the other way around ? ) filmed by the man that made ""Harsh Times"". It's Ellroy's writing, with all his classic trademark notes, and Ayer's camera. It doesn't glorify cops; it doesn't judge them either. It just puts up a mirror : if the reflected image looks ugly, don't blame the mirror blame reality. If anything, it's an ironic ode to the last ""lone ranger""- but in this case it's not Wyatt Earp, it's just an obscure LAPD cop. Times have changed, legal system has been overtaken by procedures and technicalities and lawyers that can twist words such as a murderer can walk out of court with a grin on his face, all based on a tiny slip of the lawLAPD's answer to all this is Tom Ludlow. He follows different rules ; he defines justice on his own terms. The ancient terms. The law of the street. But he does not enjoy it. It's a duty, not a passion. He takes no pleasure in the pain he inflicts upon others ; deep down inside, it hurts him too. All those images haunt him, but he never complains . Instead, he just goes more and more out of control. And we gradually learn that he was shaped to become that way ; that his mentor noticed his temper and turned Tom into his weapon. A weapon he uses according to his own agenda. And everyone manipulates him. And he's a loner par excellence. Can't relate to people, can't relate to his own emotions. So he drinks to drown them. Ludlow is not an alcoholic ; he doesn't drink to stop the shakes; he drinks to numb his feelings. And it's not working. The movie also touches the ""why's"" of corruption. For some cops it's about money, for some it's about dope ; for some it's about power. For Ludlow, it's about the purpose justifies the means. He breaks the rules for justice – or his idea of justice. All he wants is to 'get the bad people', whatever it takes. The irony is that this wreck train, this loose cannon, this half-demented character is in fact an innocent. Ludlow is just a soldier, following orders, and a code of honor that goes only one way. He's just a pawn – and he'll have the fate of a pawn. Used both to open the game and to end it He's used and framed by the people he considers his 'family'. After all, he's a victim of his colleagues' actions, and of his own self-destructive nature. Survives betrayal, yet he doesn't really change. And as the movie develops, Ludlow's eyes begin to openjust to realize that what it looks like is not always what it is . he gets tangled in the spider's weband there's no way out. Acting : Forrest Whitaker's captain Wander was a little over-the-topbut it was only this character who could have won over Ludlow, and be accepted as a mentor. As for Keanu Reeveshe just WAS Ludlow he was so believable it hurts. After Constantine and Bob Arctor, I thought I've seen everything. Well, I was wrong. He surprised and amazed me again. And I have a feeling there are quite a few more surprises in store for usif we'll just be patient. And if lady luck will be on his side",Street Kings
117,leorican,Ted's New Adventure,5,22 August 2008,"First let me say if you don't figure out whats really going on in about the first 15 to 20 minutes of this movie...then you must have fallen asleep. Keanu Reeves spends the whole movie trying to figure out what is so painfully obvious to the viewer. A tale of corruption, secrets, lies, betrayals, and half-truths involving a special police unit helmed by the over acting Forest Whittaker. Keanu is his right hand man leading a special group who are into vigilante justice. Someone close and out of Keanu's characters past threatens their set up and what follows is a nicely paced familiar and uninspired plot. Some familiar faces pop up here in there in staple stereotype characters that fill these types of movies. You can tell what its trying to be but as clueless as Keanu is through this whole movie so are the makers of this film not to have it dawn on them that this has been done before in so many different ways. Keanu tries to do his best at portraying the alcoholic screwed up bad cop/good cop in turmoil but at times it doesn't stick...while other times he shines. My favorite cameo is of Hugh Laurie, the actor who portrays the doctor in ""house""...watch for his ""wink at House"" introduction to the plot. One of the best scenes in the movie deals with Keanu and two Chinese characters and Keanus characters assessment of their whole bad boy wanna be persona's. I wont say I wasn't entertained because I was...just not inspired or thrilled. Still keanu showed some chops and that he can play something other than ""Neo"" or ""Ted""",Street Kings

I understand that his role was supposed to be cold and ruthless, but I just couldn't get into his character. All I keep seeing is Keanu Reeves, an actor just reading off lines. I still can't figure out how he gets so much work. I actually liked Chris Evans better than I liked him. Hugh Laurie was also really good, and as always you would never know he's English. Common was in the movie for about five or ten minutes, and we were of course expecting him to play a bigger part just because of the ads.

Result... some of the schemes does not look ethical. We are introduced to our main cast Tom Ludlow (played by Keanu Reeves) an old hand LAPD, who is haunted by his past, is questioned when one of his mate Washington (enacted by Terry Crews) gets massacred which seems to be a regular shoot out case. Circumstantial evidences leads Ludlow as the suspect. Though initially this case looked usual, further inquiry takes us deep into the world of corruption and manipulation of evidences to hide some grimy truth. This movie portrays how Ludlow questions his loyalty towards his unit who seemed to be behind the murder of his friend & how he ultimately deals with it.Reeves' role as Ludlow was believable but not great. Though the movie initially starts with a pace, in between it seemed a little bit exhausted. I will not grumble that I got jaded with the movie but on the other hand this movie could have been more exhilarating, if we had the chance to see some character development. None of the characters were well explored. This is no 'L.A.

In the first few minutes of the film we get to know our main character Detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reaves) I won't say how this is portrayed but its very good indeed and we get to see some great gun handling. Once we have settled down and gotten to know Ludlow we are then introduced to his boss Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) He comes across as a good guy, I think I'll stop while I'm ahead and let you figure the film out on your own.Go and watch Street Kings it's a thrill ride, full of effects and off the wall gun fights, well worth your money.

123,jhobdell,Very dark corrupt cop drama,7,18 April 2008,"This was a pleasant surprise for me. I'm one of those that doesn't rate Keanu Reeves very highly for his acting ability. I can't quite make up my mind with this one: there wasn't much from him other than angry or 'I don't care', but it works here. There's a rising insanity about the situation throughout, right up to the end, but somehow he cares so little about anything but 'locking up bad guys' that he doesn't crack, and I think Reeves' blanket 'I don't care' persona is ideal.

After the first dozen or so gaffs, cue Keanu throwing up in toilet, cue Keanu swaggering every line like he just remembered what to say next, cue the donkey-eyed cop face as Keanu ducks, flanks and fully extends his sidearm around every hidden corner; you start to wonder is this movie taking itself seriously. Then the bomb drops, Detective Washington (yes Washington), who turns out to be a black ex-partner turned Turncoat for Internal Affairs against Keanu - are you with me - is horribly gunned down in front of said ex-partner. Now we have all just witnessed at least 100 bullets riddling this poor guys body, but that doesn't stop Keanu from stating ""Stay with me Washington"". Oh brother. Why didn't he just say ""You killed my partner, you expletive""? But that is when the tide turns for this movie. You realize, it's not taking itself seriously, its having fun at poking fun at all the 80's (The Rookie, Lethal Weapon, Point Break, etc etc) and yes some 90's (Dark Blue, Last Action Hero, etc, etc) cop, buddy, detective-on-the-edge movies that stopped being guilty pleasures and started feeling like a mundane ouroborous (look it up if you haven't seen Adaptation) and seamlessly replaceable carbon copies.Then we have the actors. Jay Mohr, horribly miscast, as current team member and always a shady glean in his eye foreshadowing his inevitable typecast deception. Forest Whitaker, long overrated and soon to be dismissible presence as the Captain-on-the-take father figure. If he didn't try do desperately to be Denzel, it would be easier to let the overacting and eventual fall-back to the stereotyped omniscient black overseer which he so often plays. Joe Morton, Don Cheadle anyone? In any case the character simply does the 80's style police captain gorilla dance (not a racial slur, plenty of white captains do the same thing) while simultaneously having ulterior motives. Sigh...Even with all the bad, this movie however does deserve a viewing, if nothing more than to reacquaint us all with the movies we love to hate. Flashbacks of those almost unwatchable childhood memories of Beverly Hills Cop and even a few cop&dog movies were unavoidable while sitting through SK.Go see it or better yet rent it, or even better yet watch it at a friend's house.

This is the first positive thing in the film. The second one is a surprising end, but we see such things in almost every American action movie. The negatives are that the fights with fists are unreal, because there is no blood (not in gun fights!). Truly said I was expecting something more. Something similar to American Gangster. Do not expect, because you will be disappointed. It is typical American movie- unreal investigation, where a detective comes, everybody tells him everything he wants.

Be it trapping and killing the bad guys, or seeking revenge for his ex-partners vicious murder. He trusts his ""brothers"" and believes in what he does—no matter how bloody he gets in the process. Reeves plays it with just the right amount of weariness and naiveté to make it believable.Forest Whitaker's overacting at times is the only thing that was a little off-putting, however, his acting was on par with his role and it made sense. However Hugh Laurie does an excellent job as Captain Briggs, a power player in the LAPD who's just on the edge of entanglement in a conspiracy of murder, money and power. Terry Crews, John Corbet, Jay Mohr, Common and Amaury Nolasco do a fine job of making me loathe them as dirty cops in a department full of dirty cops.I'd like to add that in my opinion, Common's acting is probably some of the finest you'll ever see in a rapper turned actor for a very long time. He plays the role of a cop gone so deep undercover, he's more criminal than he ever was a cop.I heard nothing but silence or jeers from the critics about this movie, sadly I listened and for far too long. For nearly a year I missed out on one of the best cop films in the genre. It's a nice little thriller with a good amount of action thrown in. The twists and turns are appropriate and highly believable and as a cop drama, it serves it purpose.",Street Kings
127,Kings_Requiem,Cops,10,24 March 2015,"WOW! is the one word I can think of when describing Street Kings. It combines a little bit of every cop movie we've ever seen and puts it all together to create the BEST cop movie period.The cast is suspect at times but all of them seem to redeem themselves at different points throughout the movie. (Reeves, Whitaker, Laurie, Evans, Crews, Harris, Mohr, Nolasco, & Corbett)While some will say that this movie is racist and is a despicable depiction of the LAPD and it's just a rehash of every other cliché and police movie, but to me that is what makes this movie so strong because it uses all the clichés and puts them together to show us as the audience the rough, dirty, and harsh ways of cops in L.A. and on the streets.This movie should be a part of everyone's movie collection and should be considered an Instant Classic in ""Cop/Action"" Genre for years to come.",Street Kings

But he enacts a different role here and delivers it impressively.The movie by David Ayer is along the steps of harsh times and training day. Keanu Reeves is a cop with dark shades in his professional life. He gets entangled in murder of a fellow cop and throws open a vicious circle of corruption. The movie will keep you guessing all the time and has all the elements of a tight thriller.For me LA Confidential still remains one of the best cop - corruption movies i have seen along with dirty harry series. But this one has created its own slot.",Street Kings

'Internal Affairs', 'Dark Blue', 'Training Day', etc. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of this stuff and this was watchable and for the most part enjoyable, but it was also cringe inducing at times, rehashing stuff that has all been done before and improving on none of it.From the outset, a bit like 'Training Day for Dummies' perhaps, cliché, corn and stereotype are thrust in our faces, nothing is hinted at, implied or left to comprehension or interpretation, it's all just spelled out in black and white. Drinking behind the wheel, the lost wife, the falling out with the old partner, the 'rat', the good cop standing up to the racism, the guys on the same 'team' shoving and pushing each other and spoiling to fight at every opportunity and the obligatory head honchos 'retirement fund'. Did I mention the Internal Affairs guy on the trail?With lines like - ""We're cops, we can do whatever we like, it's all in how you write it up afterwards"", this is no classic I'm afraid and there was very little in it that you couldn't see coming.Still, it does have its moments, but it also doesn't miss any chances to shoot itself in the foot plenty of times along the way either.",Street Kings

Street Kings was showing, and it looked pretty good, so we thought ""why not""...This film has a very solid cast, with lots of big names and lots of talent, and the plot is also fairly free of major holes. In the cinema it was quite enjoyable, but it seemed to lack a certain something. On the small screen it was noticeably much less enjoyable.I cannot really put my finger on the problem. My only real criticisms are Keanu's continued woodenness, that has sadly been a continuous feature of his acting career, and also the miscasting of the very talented Forest Whitaker. I thought that his role could have been played more effectively by somebody a little older.Formulaic but relatively enjoyable, this film is worth seeing once, but you won't benefit from seeing it twice.",Street Kings

Story is straight forward and lacks intelligence. no thrill and not much of action as well. Plot is laid down not intelligently. Average person can predict the plot.Camera work and editing is OK. I think cast is not well picked. Forest Whitaker was good as usual. I am surprised by good acting of Chris Evans and he looks quite handsome in this picture. But picking Keanu Reeves as a lead was not a good. You need here a solid actor but Keanu Reeves is famous for bad acting skills. His gestures do not look like a cop.

136,inkslug,"A decent cop thriller, but not in Training Day's league",7,27 May 2008,"I've read some reviews on here that slag off this movie because they claim the plot is incoherent and makes no sense. Well I have to totally disagree with that, and can only assume that those reviewers have phenomenally low IQs.The film follows a few days in the life of Keanu's character- an old school cop who ruthlessly takes out the bad guys and lies through his teeth to get the job done. In that sense he is a corrupt cop, but he's not on the take, and as the movie unfolds he discovers his ex partner is grassing him up to Internal Affairs and he must get to the bottom of a cop killing incident that increasingly stinks of blackmail, dirty money and cops betraying cops. I think that's as much as I can say without giving anything away.My main criticism of this film is that for me, the plot and the twists were far too obvious. So if your one of those people like me who sees twists coming a mile off, but hates it when that happens, you may be disappointed. So I recommend either switching off your brain or giving yourself a congratulatory pat on the back when your guesses are gradually confirmed as the movie unfolds. You can then laugh at the idiots on IMDb who couldn't make sense of it.There's plenty of shoot outs, some decent action, and an interesting slant on the Internal Affairs scenario. Admittedly many of the characters are clichés but what cop thriller isn't riddled with them? And besides, clichés are clichés because they are often spot on to reality. Hugh Laurie has a small but significant role as a 'House' version of an Internal Affairs officer. I was annoyed by the ending, in that certain faceless and unknown corrupt officials appear to end up being protected and not pay for their crimes, but on reflection I realise that had this story been a true one, then that would have been exactly what would have happened.All in all a good effort, not in Training Day's league but let's face it that was something extraordinary. Don't listen to the dunce's that claim the plot is a mess and doesn't make sense, it's just that those reviewers are so thick they have to crap on anything they don't understand and really should be watching The Telly Tubbies instead.",Street Kings
137,Skriptman,Solid action pic,8,13 April 2008,"Okay, let's face it. The credibility factor in almost ALL action flicks is questionable at best. If you really took the time to analyze the logic behind the story, you'd come up short. But, by definition, action pics are just that -- heavy on the action, and not so heavy on the logic that supports the story. With this in mind, Street Kings is a solid, well-executed action flick that has all the right ingredients: a non-conformist hero you WANT to root for; a never-let-up story that keeps you riveted to the end; and a stylish, fast-paced visual smörgåsbord that delivers from start to finish.Yes, the story falls short -- you'll find yourself asking questions like ""Why did the undercover cops that Tom Ludlow (Keanu) kill want to eliminate Detective Washington if they weren't part of Det. Wander's crew to begin with?"" Yeah, it does get a little dicey if you think it through -- but if you DON'T bother getting bogged down in the minutia, it works. Contrary to much of the published critique of the movie, I think Keanu brings exactly what is needed to the role -- he's vulnerable, jaded, broken... and invincible.

Finally I sit through one that is really good. Make sure you are comfortable before it starts because you won't want to miss anything.... this movie starts off fast, keeps racing, speeds up and crosses the finish line at top speed.The story is about a cop that works in a special unit that is almost above the law. Well, actually the story is about all of the guys in that unit, but the lead is Keanu Reeves. Now every time I see him I see Bill S Preston Esquire from Bill and Ted. Even when he was in the Matrix (which I loved). However, here he did such a good job playing this burnt out, pushed to the limit, cop that I didn't think about it one time! All of the other actors did astonishingly well, too. The story line is pretty tight and the cinematography is nice as well.On the Gargamel Scale it gets 1 for car chase, 1 for guns/explosions, 1 for acting, 1 for story and hmmmm.... well there was no nudity even though there would have been a couple of easy chances for some....so 0 points there.

Though the concept was original with Keenu Reeves and Chris Evans being the vigilantes of the LA street, I found that this movie had an immense amount of time used for dialoge. I remember watching it and expecting for some action, but getting more informative clues leading to the next chase and then to the next. The action scenes may have been the most interesting part of the film, but seeing as it stars Keeanu reeves, most people know he made no mistakes in the matrix. If you are into movies like this, than I would say go watch it, but if your more into the action, and concept than look somewhere else, because this film may overthrow you with their abrasive language and gunpoint drives.",Street Kings

141,Mudbug711,I give this film a big................... WHOA!!!!,9,16 April 2008,"This film really surprised me. First off, I did go into the theater expecting Keanu to play as one of his cliché character modes. Boy, was I dead wrong. You will somewhat expect him as Neo, Jack Traven, or Ted Logan. Nope.... This has to be one of his best performances to date, no doubt. He makes his character so believable, and totally human like. The character of Det. Ludlow is very intense, very gritty, yet is nervous. You will have to see this performance for yourself. Outstanding....Next, was the great cast behind Keanu. The always lovable Forest Whitaker plays a role that you will just shake your head at in astonishment... that is all I am gonna say about that. The loved House M.D. Hugh Laurie is terrific, and downright straight as a iron beam as his character is sporadically thrown throughout this film. Jay Mohr is not so easily recognizable with a mustache on his face, although, he plays a rare great role.The script is also what really makes this movie. The acting from all performers is awesome, even down to the little stand in one liners. The tough, gritty Los Angeles locales, and backdrops puts you right in the action, the camera is worked with perfection, with just a tad of shakiness, to give you the rough cut feel.So, if you want to go see a flick with great acting, a vehicle that makes your mouth water.. (Oh yeah, it's got a Hemi), a rough, and tumble cop thriller, with some decent shoot em' up scenes, that will leave you on the edge of your seat, AND an outcome that you most likely will not expect... This movie you may just like, and enjoy. Keanu looks like he grown up, and matured into a pretty darn decent actor. You will somehow be surprised yourself of this film. I actually give this film an 8 1/2 of 10.",Street Kings
142,tomasdiaz,Great action wrapped in a confusing story,7,29 August 2008,Street Kings by Director David Ayer is loaded with great action scenes. Other than that the story was too damn confusing littered with Hollywoods typical idea of the mean streets.The Good on this one was great action. Pleny of shootings filled with blood. I can't remember a recent movie that has done it better. Actor Chris Evans (Det. Disco) was great. He stole every scene he was in. The Bad was the story. It was confusing and made no sense. Felt like an after thought compared to the action. It was like some Hollywood bigwig decided they didn't a story if the action was there. Action won't hide a bad story. The twists and turns were totally forced. Any viewer with half a brain cell knew who the bad guy was right at the start. Movie audiences are smarter than this one gave them credit for being. A give away the story was going to be bad was 3 writers listed in the credits because it felt like 3 different storys thrown together.The Ugly was Jay Mohr as a tough guy dirty detective. Jay Mohr LOL! Totally wrong for the movie. The pointless love interest of Det. Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) played by Martha Higareda. Am I only the viewer that wondered why her character was in the movie?The most unbelievable BS was that a Mexican gangbanger named Quicks played by Noel G. would have inside information on a a black gangbanger Grill (The Game). Street Kings being set in LA should have known better. Racial tension between blacks and mexicans unfortunately is real on the streets of LA. Wrtiters took easy way to get a piece of information out.

This is probably enhanced by the fact there are broad range of top actors in the film- this can sometimes go wrong but here it goes well. Forest Whitaker puts in a performance that is out of this world. I always thought Denzel Washington was the best black actor of all time (which he is) but the more of Whitaker i watch- i realise he has truly great qualities. But overall the film is fast paced, intriguing and well worth a watch. Although after fully thinking through there are some questions about storyline but that makes the film great.

Well directed and pacey, with some strong acting from the leads, except Mr. Reeves.I'm sorry to say that I'm always nervous when I am about to sit down to see dear Keanu in action. When I watch him I never stop realizing that he is acting. He never convinces, especially if he has more than the occasional line to deliver. His dialog is thankfully limited in this movie but not enough to save his neck. Keanu - you were the weakest link (as usual) - Goodbye! But I give the movie a 7 despite him.",Street Kings
145,EddyOne,Street Kings don't deserve the crown,5,10 April 2008,"I just saw a sneak preview of the movie. I'm a big fan of Training Day. I even liked Harsh Times. Dark Blue wasn't great, but I've seen worse cop thrillers. So my expectations were kinda high. Sadly Street Kings was a huge disappointment for me. It's like everything that happens in the movie, I've already seen in a movie before... and better. For example the performances by the actors. Keanu Reeves is terrible! He has exactly one facial expression, that lasts from the first to the last minute. I didn't buy the tough cop from him. Compared to what Christian Bale showed in Harsh Times, Reeves fails to deliver. Bale made you feel his anger and was absolutely believable, though he played a rather crazy man. Another example the guest appearances by rappers The Game and Common. They seem like cameos in a bad sitcom. It was like Ayer was trying to make this movie more ""gangsta"" and ""rough"" by placing them in some random scenes. Too bad they had no real story or personality. None of the characters are believable. There is no interesting background, no depth. The whole story is a big cliché and pretty predictable with those random scenes. Like the -""let's go check out the ghetto for some clues"" -scene. Another good example is the scene, where Keanu Reeves talks Spanish to a little girl. That's just another example of Ayer trying to give the movie some authentic ""street credibility"". I've seen this - ""old cop showing young cop how to be close with 'these' people and get important information by speaking their native language""-scene a dozen times before. The Movie feels like a bad copy of Ayers previous works. Forest Whitakers last scene, almost made me laugh. And that's not a good thing, as it tried to be very dramatic. I'm really cheap when it comes to L.A. cop movies. It don't take too much to impress me. But this one sadly didn't at all.

Please do not built high expectation or compare to Training Day because it is unfair to the Street Kings. Yes, this movie is not as good as the Training Day, but does it mean this is a bad movie to see? I say ""NO"". Keanu Reeves was taking a lot of blames(from his early years Dude....but DUDE, that was like 20 plus years ago!!! Give him a break!!!) In my eyes, keanu Reeves was very believable. His good looks makes his alcoholic, out of control, bad cop believable as he is invisible/untouchable. Oscar winner, Forest Whitaker seems over acting through the movie. Chris Evans was great additional character to spice up the movie.

148,gotmyorangecrush,Easily one of the best cop films of the decade!,7,11 January 2010,"I am one of the first people to admit how small a range Keanu Reeves has in regards to acting skill. However, as The Matrix proved, even actors with the skill level of Reeves can get a part that winds up being perfect for their style or range of acting. Street Kings is such a movie and its easily Keanu's best performance since The Matrix. In fact one could argue that in regards to acting, that this performance is actually much better than his performance in The Matrix. In other words one could make the argument that this is Keanu's best work yet.Street Kings excels on pretty much every level. It has an outstanding cast, it has a great story and its has about as perfect a pace as a crime drama dealing with this subject matter can have. It opens up fast and strong and it never drags. Why this film didn't receive more praise from the critics is beyond me. It's probably because the critics are biased when it comes to Keanu. They don't like him, never have and never will, regardless of how great a particular movie or a particular performance by Keanu really is.This film is basically a superior version of Dark Blue. If you enjoy crime drama's, especially ones that have intelligent stories and involve some serious gun play, then you should absolutely give Street Kings a look. The casting is just outstanding and everyone gives a worthy performance especially Hugh Laurie, Forest Whitaker and Keanu Reeves. It would be nice to see Hugh Laurie in more roles like this as he really was just brilliant.The bottom line - Street Kings is easily one of the best crime drama of the last 10 years and one of the most underrated films I have seen in a very long time.

I know that he is always awful, and can't act for his life, everyone knows that. but he keeps getting these dramatic roles and he can't pull it off. he needs to stick with goofy like bill and Ted. and the other reason i hate this movie so much is because there were so many cameos that i had a hard time getting into the movie. when i watch a movie i want to feel like i am in there with the characters, but when all of the characters are huge stars like the game, Cedric, Hugh Laurie Chris Evans, jay mohr, common, terry crewes. I mean they woulda been just fine with just keanu and forest. but yea, its just hard for me to get into the movie because there is no depth in the characters, when Chris Evans died i could've cared less. same goes with terry crews and Cedric the entertainer. The only one i felt bad for was forest Whitaker because he was the only good actor in this movie, and maybe common but just because he's one of my favorite music artists. and i also thought the script didn't do a good job explaining the full concept of the events taking place in the movie. i didn't realize what the movie was really about till 3 quarters into it. so yea, its just a bad movie.now i'm going to list the things i like about it. 1. action/fighting scenes were decent. 2. forest Whitaker is always good 3. had a good dark and urban feel to it 4. keanu reeves's attempt at drama always entertains me 5.

But somewhere in the middle of the movie it becomes a story about a mass murdering cop, who can't be stopped. The whole time you want him to be stopped somehow, either by death, jail, or just going on vacation. But in the end they have him keep doing the same thing. My point is that this movie is so different from every other movie, even the Departed. There is no happy ending here, a mass murderer from start to end. The people that employed him are dead, but now he has a new employer. It is a messed up, crazy movie, and I can't believe it wasn't more popular.",Street Kings

I know he cops a lot of flack for his performances at times but understated doesn't always mean wooden. He is capable of great subtlety, if you care to pay attention. If the guy looked like Sean Penn instead of Keanu Reeves, I'm sure he would get more credit than he does. The support cast are superb.

155,Gullytrotter,Really average,5,18 July 2009,"Before I sat down to write this review, I read a few of the reviews here in the IMDb and actually watched to movie. Now I am wondering if all the other reviewers did the same. Sure, there are differences in taste and there are probably also different interpretations about when a cop is dirty. Somehow, I just can neither share the super-dooper ratings nor the really bad ones.To me, Detective Tom Ludlow isn't really a dirty cop. He doesn't deal drugs or commit any other crime for his own benefit. Instead he is a bit more the kind of hero we all love from Marvel movies and comics: He takes the law into his own hand.Apart from one twist that I didn't see coming (although I am normally quite good at guessing the outcomes of rather transparent stories), the whole thing is pretty thin. The storyline could have been summed up within a 30-minute short-movie, just about all of the rest is mostly pointless shooting and violence. I am not in general a person who is against violence in movies, but I don't find it very entertaining as end in itself. As an example, I really liked the computer game Deus Ex but I didn't like Serious Sam.What really bugged me most was that all stereotypes of American cops had to be taken up (again). Police men have a problem with conduct, only just respect their superiors, have lost their wife some way or another, don't seem to have anything worth calling a home and either smoke like hell, drink or both. You bettcha, Reeves plays a cop who does it all. It almost boils down to Reeves as a bum with a gun and a fast car who seems to be on the better side of the law.Most of the acting was atrocious, which could also be a result of the script and the exceptionally flat characters that wound their way all through the movie. There were two exceptions: Hugh Laurie (who seemed a bit too much like 'House' for my taste) and Naomie Harris (who played Linda Washington). The role of the latter was rather small but at least acted well, even if the widow who comes around is in itself a rather dumb idea - especially for the meager interactions their were between Reeves and her. Speaking of those, Tom Ludlow was the former Partner Linda Washington's Husband, it seems a little strange to me, that Tom would address her as Mrs Washington.Normally, Forest Whitaker is really good at his job. But like his role in 'The Shield', this one doesn't really fit him and the result is that both characters seem very much alike although they should have nothing to speak of in common. Whitaker's character packs a good punch which seems somewhat out of place in comparison with the rest of the role. This is not so much Whitaker's problem (who did great in Ghost Dog) but a problem with the role itself. Chris Even's Character had a similar problem as it was never too sure where he stood and what his agenda really was. Basically, Evans and Whitaker suffered from roles who's pieces just didn't fit together. Neither could convince me in this movie.The action scenes were quit good, somewhat overdone in most cases, making Ludlow look more like a downtown version of Rambo, but at least the scenes well laid out. The camera wasn't always spot on, resulting in some actions scenes looking more like blurs than anything else - even if viewed in HD.The music was typical for an action movie. It lacked detail is some cases, seemed a little too loud in some scenes and started a little too early once or twice. But this type of movie doesn't live off the music anyway so that can be excused.After all that, you might think this is a really bad movie. It's not. It's just not a really good movie either. Watch it, think about it, but don't expect too much.",Street Kings
156,macias-5,Almost a remake,5,13 August 2008,"Watching this movie is like deja vu -- I already saw this plot filmed at least two times, the same scenario (even the ""team in the restaurant"" scene was familiar). What is ""screenplay"" today means if it is just the same thing going on and on?Well, I can't tell I was bored because good actors and nice pace delivers entertainment but there was nothing fresh or surprising here. The story starts familiar, it ends in predictably and the way it unfolds is way too obvious.My advice: pick another movie because you will just waste almost 2 hours on stuff you know already.",Street Kings
157,Watcher120,"Fun Flick -- ""The Shield"" on Steroids",8,12 May 2008,"OK, some of the acting is a little stiff, most notably Hugh Laurie who seems to take a deep breath before every line as though he's struggling to keep an ""American"" accent, and the normally great Forest Whitaker is a little sloppy, but, so what, this is not an actor's movie. It's an action film. As such it has good overall direction, good photography that makes excellent use of Los Angeles, very good action scenes, good music, and, above all, a rapid pace. Keanu Reeves is a solid choice for the lead as he has a driven intensity which fits the bill just fine. It's a slam against the LAPD but basically the same story as you get on the TV show ""The Shield,"" just more brutal and with lots of non-TV cursing.Chill. Have fun watching it.

Only if one of the other officers had said,""...don't you mean a hearse?"" Could the damn thing be ""more worser."" Geez, what a crummy movie.I make no apology - it was my free movie of the week and a complete waste of 45 minutes, which is the point at which I hit eject.

However it wasn't unique or better than training day whatsoever. True it would be unfair to compare, but it just leads me to compare. The acting was good, but the crucial thing was their is nothing that separates it and makes it a fantastic film.Well more thought should have been given to the film because the potential was there, but it just didn't make it. But to give it credit, the action scenes were on the dot and gave me the shrills. The story could have been more realistically done, and Hollywood has much influence on this film.",Street Kings
160,myrealnameisjon,A change in expectations of Keanu,9,14 December 2008,"I'm not sure if David Ayer is a miracle worker or not, but if I had never seen anything else from Keanu Reeves, I would have no other option than to proclaim that he is a phenomenon on film. Reeves ditched his usually dopey and lost demeanor for a streamline to cool, calm, and collected persona as he fulfilled the role of a hardened killer behind a badge and a gun. To be completely honest, I half expected a Point Break-esquire approach to undercover work, and it may have been my low expectations of Reeves that overshadowed what should have been reasonable consideration. The tone of the film through particular cinematic accents and slight emphasis of character correspondence gives to initial predictability. However, the plot thickens, our attachment to characters is derailed by storyline and circumstance, and the final twist puts it all away with a swift kill shot. There was not a single moment in the film where my interest was not captured or where I was not left in awe of Whitaker's passion for excellence. Furthermore, the action sequences were created with a sense of realism that leads the audience to believe that the shootouts not only could happen, but do. The depth of character development, the unraveling of the plot, the cinematic artwork through realistic action sequences, and the prime picks for the cast made this movie not only one worth watching, but one to be purchased and watched repeatedly.",Street Kings

162,sljohnson12,Entertaining & Thought Provoking,9,1 November 2009,"This movie is interesting & very entertaining, most definitely great for what it is. Similarities can be drawn with L.A. Confidential, in the sense that there is clear corruption within the police force present in the films & that as the film progresses towards the climax the viewer is slowly brought to understanding just how deep it runs. I would give it 8.5/10 but, given the scoring system on IMDb, rounded up as is custom with currency. The plot is easy enough to follow, the premise standard enough to not require unnecessary devotion to the establishment of such & the actual execution being notably stylish. Cinematography is sophomoric however does not detract from the experience of watching it, so in a way keeping with this simplicity works in favor. The film grain used really adds visceral tones, which helps to accentuate the gritty ambiance necessary for the intents of the director. What should be stressed is that I found this movie entertaining & thought provoking in the sense that it was very interesting to see how the plot unveiled, although there were some bits that were predictable. This, however, did not kill any of the entertainment value & plus, these days it is very difficult to avoid clichés set by classics that are now considered archetypes.Given high production values, a great cast & above average performances, Street Kings will not necessarily be marked as a classic within the genre as it will a very entertaining crime thriller. I would strongly recommend to fans of this movie the movie Training Day, Dark Blue or L.A. Confidential & vice versa- if you enjoyed any one of the aforementioned titles, then Street Kings will be very likely to entertain you as well.",Street Kings
163,jusdiz2,Bad movie,3,20 July 2015,"This is a bad movie, I did not like it. Why I have watched it? First, I have seen David Ayers ""Harsh Times"" and I expected something harsh too. I did not get it. Keanu Reeves trying to look harsh, he fails. Forest Whitaker is not harsh, Hugh Laurie, Chris Evans - they are not harsh too. But this is not the main problem.The main problem is that I did not care about a main character Tom Ludlow. He is stupid, he makes stupid mistakes and he makes other people around him to behave stupid. I think I care more if the movie would be about how his wife died or about detective Terrence Washington and his wife. This story is about how about corrupt police officer Tom Ludlow starts to think and doubt about what he is doing, and everybody around him starts to die, and he kills some men too. He is not a hero, he doesn't know what he wants.So this is not a movie on which the director - David Ayer makes his choices, this is bad Hollywood movie. If you want to see really good action crime drama go see ""Harsh Times"" and ""Training Day"".",Street Kings

Keanu Reeves was fantastic in this film and it really showed me what a great actor he is. I have had a hard time imagining him in anything since The Matrix, but he really pulled this character off and showed me what he is made of.The rest of the cast is solid as a rock too, but the thing that really stood out to me was the writing. This film is a throwback to the cop thrillers of the 1970's, but with MUCH better writing and bigger budgets. There are even a few genuine laughs to go with all of of the action and it is great to see Jay Mohr doing something other than ""The Ghost Whisperer!"" The audience reaction in this movie was refreshing as well. It is quite easy to get absorbed in this one.Prediction: Street Kings is the number one film on it's opening weekend.",Street Kings
166,phillips-adl,Not entirely terrible,5,23 January 2015,"I thought that this might be a sort of diamond in the rough. Keanu Reeves comes back with some undiscovered show of promise, and to some extent it was although I was still somewhat disappointed. The film started out very badly, I actually began to wonder if I could do better personally, even in terms of the moving around parts, nevermind the actual speaking parts. Keanu Reeves was incredibly wooden, as is his way and I found that quite distressing (despite being an enormous Point Break fan). However, I found my laziness sufficient to avoid turning the film off and so continued to watch, at which point I actually started to enjoy it more. In summary, if you want some good cr*p to watch, this is your baby. Looking for a well written plot, good acting and any sense of realism then maybe shop around a little more. I know it gets hard when you're sad and have seen everything like me - but hey at least I'm not a film buff watching film noir yet.",Street Kings

It had an amazing cast and every one of them put in a top notch performance. The story was fast paced with some twists and had an excellent showdown at the end. Great action, excellent acting, and a good storyline sets up a great movie experience.If you enjoyed Reeves in John Wick, then you will enjoy this movie also. Go back and find it.

Street Kings was latter: The viewer is pushed right into the action with a sublime shooting scene after soberly been introduced to the life of Tom Ludlow, played by Keanu Reeves. Soon afterward, intrigues develop around Tom and the action begins.The story is great, dense and doesn't reveal any possible endings or details to the audience: Moments of surprise guaranteed!Keanu Reeves delivers an outstanding performance playing the cop Tom Ludlow - never saw him delivering substantive acting like in Street Kings since Matrix.Everyone who likes cop movies has probably already seen Street Kings but to the others: This movie is really good.

The relationship between Reeves and Whitaker is exactly the same as Washington and Hawke. Hell, even the storyline was almost the same. But, in my honest opinion Washington is a better actor than Whitaker. Also, Training Day actually portrayed the 'feel' of the film better for this gruesome brutal street life where you better watch your back. Whereas, Street Kings was kind of like a...let's take some playful actors and make them seem bad ass type of feel to it.I'm sorry, but Hugh Laurie as an insurance agent just DID NOT work, he's played in House too many times to be taken seriously as that role in a film. Also, Whitaker has played too many roles as the concerned father type to be really taken seriously as a bad ass crooked cop type. I'm sorry but there were just too many people playing too many roles that did not fit, it wasn't very believable and wasn't all that great.

Keanu Reeves plays detective veteran Tom Ludlow, a hero solo cop dishing out justice at any cost.Director David Ayer portrays a city infected with corruption at the highest of levels, where the streets are as dark and as violent as the men who govern them. Combined with the convincing performances of Forest Whitaker and Chris Evans, Street Kings' intricate plot is engaging and consistently entertaining.Surprisingly, its only flaw is in having casted Keanu Reeves as the film's lead. Unfortunately, Reeves lacks the hard-boiled renegade edge that is meant to distinguish his character from the other LAPD officers.

If IMDb could let me write only one line as a review the above mentioned sentence would be it. Seriously, this movie was a train-wreck from the first opening shot...I think that is mainly due to Keanu Reeves. I have only liked him in one role and that is Ted Logan from, ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"". I really can't blame this all on Keanu though, because even the writing was downright horrible. It just was one cliché cop line after another about a man who wants ""justice"" or whatever. Not to mention that the plot was just filled with big holes and meaningless characters. How Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie, and Keanu Reeves ended up in such a train-wreck of a movie baffles me. What actually gets me the most is how people are comparing this movie to ""Training Day"". Seriously? You see unlike ""Street Kings"", ""Training Day"" was actually good.",Street Kings
178,j_jefferson55,Like a sequel to Training Day,7,13 March 2009,"Street Kings is a very enjoyable movie. I must say, though, that it seems like a sequel to the movie Training Day. A few examples: the central theme in both movies is police corruption, they both take place in L.A., and the lead characters in both movies are undercover cops.Also, the two movies have similar scenes, such as when Keanu Reeves' character instructs a character to go ""fetch"" a suspect (think back to training Day when Denzel Washington tells Ethan Hawk to do the same thing) in the ghetto, and when Keanu Reeves breaks into the Korean's house and kills them all, even the unarmed suspects, and makes it seem like justifiable homicide (think back in training day when Denzel does the same thing to Roger for the money).Still, this is a good movie. Keanu Reeves did a great job as the lead. His character is the lone officer in his division with scruples (although he does his share of dirt throughout the movie) after his ex-partner gets gunned down right in front of him. And the plot takes off from there.Finally, this is a worthwhile movie, especially if you like movies involving corrupt cops. Very gritty and graphic.",Street Kings

It isn't a wall to wall mindless action film but yet it remains fairly violent and gritty. It isn't really a cop partner flick but it features buddy elements.The best way to define Street Kings is a cop revenge flick with some twists throw in for good measure. Predictable? For the most part. The action scenes are enjoyable. The film has a certain mean mentality that benefits the subjects the film discusses such as political corruption and racism. Keanu plays the role with distance and anger that from time to time works. The supporting cast holds the film together and makes it all come together nicely. The problem is the film may have a bit too many characters to juggle. The film has a rough time developing the characters and the given situations.Again, this might be asking a bit much from a film called ""Street Kings"" but for a gritty 2 hour cop flick starring Keanu Reeves it could have gone much worse.

182,john_minty,Not as good as you'd expect,5,16 March 2009,"Glancing at the cast list for 'Street Kings', which between them have gained an Oscar, a BAFTA and two Golden Globes it is difficult not to expect something great from David Ayer's second directorial feature. Those however who do expect something (like myself) are due to be bitterly disappointed. 'Street Kings' tells the story of LAPD detective Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves). He is a burnt-out cop, an alcoholic who is a bit of a renegade yet still gets results. Our anti-hero is joined by his boss Captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) who main job appears to be to keep Ludlow on-the-rails. This already clichéd plot is enhanced by the murder of Ludlow's former partner Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) and thus leads Ludlow on a path to find his killers and exact vengeance. If this plot sounds somewhat familiar to you it probably is, the narrative is entirely unoriginal and lacking any kind of substance, it feels like you've seen it all before. It is disappointing to say the least as the cast do the best they can with a decidedly average script. The aforementioned Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker play their parts very well but the actor that stood out for me was Chris Evans, who gave a solid performance as Paul Diskant, an officer who helps Ludlow. Formerly of 'Sunshine' and 'Fantastic Four' fame he steps up to the mark and outshines the rest of the cast, which includes Hugh Laurie, whose almost cameo role must have been cast to pull in the audience as he really doesn't suit his character or the lines he is given. After a relatively fast tempo, interesting opening, 'Street Kings' dissolves into a forgettable film which despite being gritty in places fails to hold the audience. The action scenes are handled well, especially the shooting and chase sequences but are nothing that hasn't been done better before. The grittiness of the film is probably its best point, made even more apparent by the total lack of humour Ayer decided to include - usually encompassed in this genre of film, a little humour goes a long way but the absence of it made the character's supposedly solid relationships unbelievable and false. The camera-work does complement the urban nature of the film; the shaky hand-held, constantly moving camera keeps the scenes uncomfortable and realistic. 'Street Kings' is not without its merits, namely the performances from some of the cast and the way it is shot but the unlikeable characters and predictable, unoriginal narrative will put many off. Fans of Ayer's previous written work 'Training Day' may well be in for a treat though, as his latest effort bears striking resemblance to his 2001 hit, but others, especially those looking for something a little more meaty should stick well clear and try a detective drama with a little more bite, such as the classic 'LA Confidential' or more recently, 'Gone baby, gone'.5 out of 10",Street Kings

Something interesting about the selection of the cast is the use of people that are famous for other kinds of work.I would never have expected Terry Crews to play a role in a drama, and I couldn't help but expect Cedric the Entertainer to spit out a few more one-liners. But Cedric plays a completely different role than he usually does and it is gold for his career.Common (a rapper turned pretty decent actor) made a nice unusual appearance as well. After playing a thoughtful, level-headed gangster type in Smokin' Aces, it seemed that he was comfortable playing the guy with good morale and reason. His role in this movie shattered that perception of him; he is ruthless! Reeves does a good job of taking the back seat to these characters when it is necessary. The appreciation of this is realized when thinking about the movies where plays an almighty type (Matrix trilogy, Constantine). He also isn't usually a f*** up.""Street Kings"" is a beautiful interweaving of actors trying something different, and it works.

This is easily his most nuanced role to date - he truly wears the weight of a cop who has seen and done too much on his face.

190,skrible71,A king of the cop,10,17 April 2008,"As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued and knew that it was going to be a great movie. And when I watched the movie, I was absolutely stunned by the plot, character, twist and everything about it. Ayer never seemed to disappoint with the award-winning Training day under his belt, Street Kings revealed the grotesque world the the L.A underworld and the corruption in law enforcement. Keanu Reeves was impressive as Det. Ludlow, he was absolutely memorable not to the extent of Denzel in Training Day. Nonetheless, It is a must see for people who love this genre and it is great for people who are not familiar to this type of film. 11 out of 10 if possible.",Street Kings
191,tyranny_of_souls,A dark and thrilling story of dirty cop who stands up against his unit,9,20 April 2008,"This is another story of corruption and treachery within one police unit, depicted from the angle of one cop who finds himself in the thick of the events that entirely discredit him as a cop. Desperate to redeem himself, he dips himself into the world of corruption and crime, trying to reach the untouchable and finally pushing himself to the point where there is no turning back. He is Tom Ludlow - a gritty, troubled, violent, vodka-addicted, gloomy widower and ""a damn fine cop"". His methods are dirty, hyper-violent and unsound, but if it is all that takes to fulfill his assignment, the end justifies the means. Whatever may go wrong, Ludlow will always be backed up by his boss and friend Jack Wander, who is always there for him to hide his dirty laundry away. Not so when Ludlow founds himself implicated in murder of his ex-partner Terrence Washington, who apparently had been reporting for Ludlow to the Internal Affair for some time. Teaming up with young detective Diskant, he sets off to find Washington's murderers and clear his own name. What follows is quite a predictable story, typical for Training Day type movies. But this story is depicted almost perfectly, giving a significant insight of the other face of LA. It is not pleasant or beautiful, but it is real. The story has a certain grip and much of dark tones, and director David Ayer does an excellent job in bringing up rough and tough story that asks more questions than it is actually able to answer. Keanu Reeves gives an exceedingly solid performance of a lonely disgraced alcoholic cop who is not able to bring his own life in order, let alone the streets of LA. He is perfect in action and convincing in intensive emotional scenes, which makes Tom Ludlow arguably the best performance in his career so far. In case of Forest Whitaker, his Jack Wander is certainly not his best role, but he portrays his character just in the way needed for the film, and so his ""LAPD godfather"" is totally believable. There are less fighting and gunfighting scenes than one can probably expect from a crime thriller, but they are spectacular and somewhat shocking. The film gives pretty strong impression and stands quite well, but you better not watch it if you're a Keanu Reeves' anti-fan because he is in EVERY scene of the movie.",Street Kings
192,henryd2001,Thumbs up!,9,10 June 2012,"Thumbs up! This was one of the great cop movies. Great acting. Good plot. The way the movie unfolds makes one watch the movie until the end. The movie also develop the characters involved which helps the movie ending. The movie's ending was somewhat unexpected and makes the movie even better. Once one understand what was going on. the ending make sense. I think this movie deserves more credit than given and as such I gave the movie a high score. Movies like this compare with the great cop movies . Forest Whitaker, good acting, Keanu Reeves, good acting. His car, it worked well with his character. Oh yeah, the Internal Affairs Captain, he also did well. I would have to say this is one of my top ten cop movies of all time. Good borderline great movie.",Street Kings
193,achilles26,Good for what it is,7,11 April 2008,"Im biased on this movie for three reasons; gun play, cop drama, and location. Having said that this movie is a similar formula to other named but it is different in the delivery from the actors. Im not saying thats it not over the top at times but overall it is a good movie for those into cop dramas. Don't go into this movie thinking ""its another gangster/training day flick"" Just do what people have forgotten about watching movies nowadays have. Just watch the movie and formulate your own opinion.

194,rockmanprince86,Underrated kick-ass movie!,8,16 June 2015,"While Street Kings may appear on the outside to be nothing more than your typical summer-time cop thriller filled with hip-hop music and rapper cameos, it is in fact almost none of that. The story is solid from beginning to end, with the focus mostly on Reeve's character's struggle to remain a good cop, but realize that once in a while the rules need to be broken to maintain justice in certain situations. Without giving too much away, I'll tell you that any particular rapper or hip-hop artist you saw in the trailer serve their purpose to the story promptly, then they're gone. Shockingly enough, there was also much more credit to be given to the acting in this film than what the trailer had shown. Many fans of currently running prime time television shows will be pleased to see a few of their favorite actors show up and give solid performances. With a story directed by David Ayer, the writer of ""Training Day"", and penned by James Ellroy, the writer of Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" and Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"", this film was intriguing and entertaining throughout the entire sitting. I suggest casual audiences go and see it the next time they're out and about or just feeling bored.

The actors are good, but you can't believe Reeves' struggle and don't get to see Laurie enough. The rest of the cast could be called ""innocent bystanders"" as the very well predictable story goes by. The best performances came from the supporting actors: Laurie played House on vacation, but we love him, and surprisingly Chris Evans performed above the aforementioned average.

I think most critics can't look at Reeves and not see Bill Preston Esq or Neo. However Keanu Reeves shows range in the movie and heads up the movie wonderfully.This movie is a fast-paced LA Cop movie. It starts off great and never slows down.

It's sad that he only got so little on screen time.My favorite scene is not the gunfights and action scenes. It is the final showdown in the film. A true testament to the acting prowess of Forest Whitaker. He simply steal the thunder and lift the show single handedly.Reeves on the other hand played out his character (a cop with moral dilemma) with the usual broodiness, seen-it-all personality. Pretty much like in Constantine. A well acted, believable character. Watch this movie if you happened to walk into the cinema one weekend with nothing in mind.",Street Kings

I rated Keanu Reeves in this film, he played a great cop, portrayed the part real well. The new cop on the block played by Chris Evans was well played also..All in all, well worth seeing, if you like fast paced action, of which is realistic, see Street Kings.",Street Kings
202,blmerriman,{{{{ Rolls Eyes }}}} This is a B movie - at best,5,26 May 2008,{{{{ Rolls Eyes }}}} AT THE TEN STAR REVIEWS. How can you make actors like Reaves and Whitaker look foolish on film? You'd think it would be difficult but the director and scriptwriters of Street Kings managed just fine. The film is hurt by the directors seeming compulsion to make every scene dark and black with small bits of mood lighting to illuminate the actors. I'm serious. What is more damaging to the film is the script. You WILL laugh out loud at the pitiful lines the actors are forced to utter. If you are looking for a gritty movie ala 'The Departed' or a non-stop action film with an actual storyline like the 'Bourne' series -- you will not find it in Street Kings. Save your money and wait for a director and script that is worthy of Whitaker and Reaves talent.,Street Kings
203,catbuttons,This is a great movie!,9,13 April 2008,"Action from beginning to end. I saw this with my sis and bro-in-law last night. We are all 50-ish grandparents and we loved it. Keanu Reeves is always getting bashed by the critics because he refuses to advertise his private life like Tom C. The man deserves his privacy, just like the rest of us. All the acting was top-notch, nothing over the top or wooden. Real testosterone, just like the law enforcers I know. You have to have the balls to be a cop these days.

One critic I read was speaking about Keannu Reeve as a bad cop waking up, drinking and shooting some guy without much reasons. So this is what I was expecting, a stupid story about a cop doing bad things without punishments. But this movie is so much more intelligent and subtile, making hard to blame the ""bad"" cop.And, contrary to The Departed (who has a quite stupid storyline), this movie is believable! Remember, in The Departed, just out of the police acadamy graduating party, the guy played by Matt Damon just meet the crime boss while all those police men around without an inch of nervosity.

It fails to link actions to character, or explain relationships between characters.It does have some brutal action scenes, which added some liveliness, but much of the movie was various characters vaguely explaining what has happened, leaving the viewer bored as hell.However, boredom is alleviated by the non-stop barrage of corny dialogue and lame clichés.The ending just tops it off, as it makes no logical sense, nor emotional sense, and the final climax of the film was a real let down.

I like action movies, even the cop ones, I like Sin City-like body counts, loved Keanu Reeves in movies like the Matrix and The watcher, but this one really, and I mean REALLY, disappointed me. I mean, a cast with names like Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie does raise a certain expectancy. The storyline itself already promised little good. An alcoholic cop who lost his wife, his partner and doesn't have much regard for the law now has to save city and pride, accompanied by some rookie. Did any one else wonder why Bruce Willis wasn't asked for the part of Tom Ludlow? The scenes of Tom going around town with his guns, vodka and unchangeable expression is not only accompanied by cliché, standard-action-movie music (the type you start to notice after a few minutes and bugs you for the rest of the time), but also by some of the worst dialogues I've seen moviecharacters have. Rivaled maybe by King Arthur's horrible attempts to sound historical and philosophical at the same time- but at least that movie had proper actors and good, exciting action in it. It also didn't have the uselessness of the plot that 'Street Kings' does possess. At the end of the movie, nothing is solved for good, Tom Ludlow'll still be depressed and the viewer is left with that same emotion and a sort of 'Ok, sooo....?'-unsatisfied feeling. And after a last look at Tom Ludlow, staring at the setting sun, exactly like Reeves (honestly man, even Neo managed a subtle change every now and then!) stared at everything else in the movie, the credits start to roll. Thank you, David Ayer, for making cops look corrupt and Reeves look untalented, for a movie with exactly one line I managed to laugh at, and please, Hugh Laurie, focus yourself on making more House-episodes for us to enjoy...!",Street Kings

208,tristenlake,Reeves & Whitaker rule in this picture,8,5 April 2009,"Keanu Reeves gives one of his best performances yet; his rapport with Forest Whitaker is powerful and intense. As written, these are not the best parts either have acted, but both actors rise far above the material in their interpretation.There is not much for me to complain about in this film, except maybe for the very first sound effect in the first scene, which reminded me rather too jarringly of a certain other Reeves film.Still trying to figure out why this film was panned by critics. Like ""Pride & Glory"" which came out a little later in 2008, the plot & dialog are solid, and the performances excellent all around. The best explanation I can think of for the negative reviews, applicable to both films, is that there is not much exposition--one must pay attention to the action and and dialog, so maybe hoi polloi just couldn't keep up with the plot. Maybe everyone has their own idea of how police work or drug trafficking are supposed to be portrayed. I expect some people were offended by the blatant and unapologetic ethnic slurs, particular as directed toward various Asian nationalities. This is probably its worst flaw, along with a lack of well-developed female characters. Well, one can't have everything -- every story or production or editing process has its exigencies.Never mind all that, this movie kicks butt from start to finish. See it.(And why all the bashing of Keanu Reeves by viewers & critics for the past 20 years? I don't get it.

212,darkw00ds,"An Honest, NO BS Review. (Slight spoilers)",5,5 October 2008,"I'm not an AVID movie goer. In fact, I can't keep up with 90% of the crap Hollywood has been spewing out since the post-matrix era. And since I think I've developed quite a keen sense of judgment from the amounts of movies I've watched, I'm just going to point out the facts from a seasoned movie go-er.A lot of people have been saying they enjoyed Keanu reeves appearance in this one, that he had more variety in his character. First of all...What variety? There is only ONE character Keanu Reeves can play best... And that character is Keanue Reeves. Yes folks, whether its from delivering a line on how cursed his life is for being a cop, or from trying to take a Manley swig of bud-light, (my girlfriend can hold a beer manlier then him) - I often wonder WHY or HOW he gets casted in these roles in the first place.Keanu is good at doing a few things, and thats the prolonged, ""concentrated"" stare. However, when you put Keanu, a soft, pale skinned mild mannered individual in the role of ""Bad ASS COP"" you get a few inconsistencies. It's hard to take intimidation seriously from a guy who moves and acts like he's a restaurant manager.But this isn't about Keanu Reeves, this is about the similarities between Training Day. Sure you can take a script, the setting, and music from David Ayer's ""Training Day"" - but when all the tools and elements are put on the table, you're still missing that crucial element. And that's ""Talent"" Whether your playing the tough-cop-gone-vigilante and beating the crap out of ""The Game"" with a telephone book, you gotta wonder if the David Ayer was trying to create a scene of humor or be serious. I don't know if it was the half-retarded facial gestures the game made while trying to feign ""pain"" after being bitched slapped with a phone-book 15 times, but he looked as if he could hardly keep himself from laughing. Maybe David Ayer just said *beep* it"" and let that scene slide, as well as many other scenes. Being a reputable ""Gangster thug rapper"" doesn't necessarily mean you should be in movies Acting. I mean Snoop Dogg pulled it off well in Training Day, but the game needs to stick to rapping (Wich he's not very good at nonetheless).Ironic The Game released a DVD entitled ""Stop Snitchin', stop lying"" - yet in his cameo role he does exactly that. He snitches.But lets not talk about the bad acting of mediocre rap stars, and focus our attention on the cast. Let us divide the GOOD acting from the BAD. Keanu reeves, supporting cops, and Forest Whitaker himself, BAD. As someone mentioned before. ALONZO from Training day. Hello? Can we say RIP OFF? And Keanu? Can we say.. ""Whoa.."" But I have to hand it to Hugh Laurie, he single handedly out-acted every role in the few 5 minutes he had in the movie then the entire 2 hours they gave Keanue, Whitaker and the rest of the so-so cast. When I looked at Hugh Laurie, I thought. ""This guy's good. I mean, he actually acts like he's been on the force for 20 years"" And when I sat through Keanu, doing his best to be a ruthless, alcoholic, tough vigilante, I could only sigh as he took a swig of beer in an overly-Manley way. Some people you know just don't drink beer. Some people you know probably only drink Zima or Rasberry martini's while sitting on the beach getting a pedicure. When they put Keanu's character at the complaint desk, I thought, ""Gee, what a fitting role, and instead of a badge, give him a Verizon or Sprint name tag with a head-set and put him in a customer service room."" I have nothing against Keanue, I loved the matrix. But then I grew up.Props to common though, who did a damn good job playing a ruthless insane killer. Who would have thought? As for Terry crews. I honestly think he could have played a better lead role then Keanu. No joke.And side by side with Keanue and his whinny face, squinter eyes and pseudo-toughness, you have to bite your tongue and remember it's just a movie. By the way, whats with the in-consistencies? If Keanu is a highly trained seasoned veteran, breaking into a Korean gang hide-out and single-handedly taking out 7-8 fully armed Koreans with deadly precision, whilst taking a shotgun blast to the side and walking away unscathed, how come he couldn't take out 2 armed rifle-men, WITH backup (Terry Crews) AND.. not to mention it.. our would-be ACE cop shoots his OWN man in the shoulder while hiding in a corner? HUH!?!? I don't want to get into ""This or that"" with the film, the script has it's issues with realism and focuses more on sensationalism, I liked the Car, the street scenes were fun, watching the game get bitched slapped by a phone-book unnecessarily wrong was also very entertaining, cop chases bad guy was fun, mostly I enjoyed the movie as long as Keanu wasn't talking. I also enjoyed the cameos by Hugh Laurie and Common, the rest of the cast, the plot, etc, in my opinion, can just go to *beep*",Street Kings
213,tre2099,Predictable and Banal...With a twist ending seen from a mile away,5,14 April 2008,"Street Kings is a film that you wish had spent a few more hours in the editing room. The plot has too many unconnected and essentially useless strands, and too many undeveloped characters whose purpose is either to kill or be killed.The first act sets up the drama, introducing Reeves as a vigilante cop with a big chip on his shoulder. He drinks too much, and insults and fights with his fellow officers. The film begins to pick up as Reeves goes on a manhunt to find the killers of a fellow officer and avenge his death. However by the third act we've had the rug pulled out from under us so many times we learn to stop stepping on it.The ending, visible from a mile away for anyone with a hunch for whodunnits, is predictable and completely unbelievable.In the midst of all the clichés, strong performances are turned in by Keanu Reeves as a dirty cop looking to avenge his partner, Cedric the Entertainer as a himself, and Common, even though he only appears in the film for a minute.Poor performances are given by Forest Whittaker overacting as police captain, Hugh Laurie as Dr. House with a badge, and Jay Mohr with the funniest looking mustache in movie history.Lurking under all this fluff is actually a good story with Reeves at its heart, working his way up the food chain until he finds his man. Its a shame we know who it is long before he does.FYI: There is one scene in the film that is so ridiculous i must share it. Reeves, in the backseat of an undercover cop car tries to escape by choking the driver, and the car crashes into another car going 100 mph. Moments later, miles away, both Reeves and the driver and unhurt. Reeves is again tied up, escapes again, and drives away in the very same car that was in the accident without a scratch on it.

My only criticism of Reeves is that he doesn't show much emotion. In fact, he seems kind of cut off. But, I know what to expect from him in all his movies. He is pretty much the same. But I enjoy his acting anyway. He does real well in the fighting scenes. This movie reminded me somewhat of Training Day.

The basic premise of the movie isn't about the typical ""hood"" shootout and drug deals . The movie deals with another side of the coin which talks about Keanu's struggle to deal with the restricted police system. You have to go see the movie to fully get the true street kings experience.

It seems every time the Reeves' character needed to travel they show him driving in his pristine Charger at break-neck speeds through the LA ghetto. They also throw in a mid level shot of the Charger's tires to give a street perspective for what seems like 30 times too many. The only reason this is getting a 3-star rating from me is because the cop mustaches were beautifully creepy. Oh, and James Bond...it's spelled ""Bullitt"".",Street Kings
218,erenta,"Great Movie, BAD Script",6,14 April 2008,"I have never seen a movie that had such an excellent cast, great action scenes, a couple of twists and turns that made the ride interesting, but such bad writing at the same time. No memorable quotes, no outstanding speeches. When you have Oscar winning cast give them something that they can work with. Even though Reeves has never been a great actor, he could have made a better job if the script hadn't been written the director's kids. The climax of the whole confrontation between Reeves and his ""enemy"" was butchered by ""You were my best friend"". Lousy writing, but great everything else. If you are the type of person that leaves your brain at the entrance then this movie is for you. If you have a little time to get to the theater then choose another one.",Street Kings
