0,Leofwine_draca,Lovecraftian action-horror,7,17 November 2018,"COLD SKIN is a Lovecraftian slice of monster horror from French director Xavier Gens, the man who made the still-shocking FRONTIERS back in the day. This one's set on a remote island where a lighthouse occupied by two characters is repeatedly assailed by hordes of fish-people who are more than a little akin to Lovecraft's ""Deep Ones"". What follows is a tale that mixes in action adventure elements, some horror, lots of suspense, and even a little unexpected romance. It's a traditional sort of movie, quite old-fashioned on purpose, but one which I enjoyed a lot. There are unique little touches to the story to keep you guessing, and a nice cyclical ending which works out superbly. Cast-wise, seasoned professional Ray Stevenson delivers another towering performance, but the stand out is the underrated David Oakes, of PILLARS OF THE EARTH fame.",Cold Skin
1,kosmasp,Cold or hot,7,5 April 2018,"It is tough to tell how the story or the characters resonate to you (that's any other viewer out there). It's part love story, but mostly a thriller about the unknown and how to deal with it. It is about loneliness and about how to fight inner and outer demons. Quite literally at times and it really can strike a nerve. Either you get on with it or it will leave you cold.All in all the movie is a chilling thriller with some decent effects. The acting is more than efficient and the story moves along nicely. You may have some issues with the characters involved, but that should not take anything away from the enjoyment you can have from the movie. It is not a great project but it's more than decent",Cold Skin
2,Woodyanders,Superior horror fantasy creature feature,8,26 August 2020,"1914. A young man (a fine performance by David Oakes) takes a job as a weather observer on a remote island. The young man soon discovers that deadly humanoid fish creatures from the sea also reside on the island. And said fish creatures are decidedly hostile towards humans.Director Xavier Gans relates the darkly engrossing story at a gradual pace, maintains an admirably serious tone throughout, makes excellent and evocative use of the isolated island setting, expertly crafts an eerie gloom-doom mood, and stages the ferociously exciting monster attack sequences with considerable skill and gusto. The intelligent script by Jesus Olmo and Eron Sheean smartly explores the extremely slight and subtle distinction between savage beast and civilized man. Moreover, there's a pleasingly creepy Lovecraftian bent to the basic premise, with the aquatic beings proving to be both convincing and grotesquely fascinating in equal measure. The strong acting by Oakes anchors this movie; he receives sturdy support from Ray Stevenson as scruffy misanthropic brute Gruner and Aura Garrido as Gruner's browbeaten creature companion Aneris. Both Daniel Aranyo's sumptuous widescreen cinematography and the lush score by Victor Reyes further enhance the overall sterling quality of this on the money film.",Cold Skin
3,CinemaSerf,"Clever, quirky, fantasy horror.",7,22 July 2020,"David Oakes is one of those actors regularly seen in lengthy historical television adaptations, but rarely making any decent appearances on the bg screen. In this clever and stylish adaptation of Piñol's novel, he plays a young man (with no name, known only as ""Friend"") deposited on a remote island as a weather monitor. He is teamed up with the rather eccentric ""Gruner"" (Ray Stevenson) and soon their rather testy relationship is being regularly challenged by their need to defend their lighthouse home each night from an army of curiously aggressive marine mammals. The mystery deepens when we discover that ""Gruner"" has one of them as a part time lover that he treats pretty appallingly. As the daily carnage continues unabated, ""Friend"" tries to find out why these attacks happen and to try and find some sort of solution. It's quite an odd concept; the story lacks structure in any conventional sense. It isn't just that they don't know why the creatures are attacking, we don't either. Their bewilderment is our's too; and coupled with the remoteness and starkness of the surroundings it actually all builds eerily and quite compellingly to a rather decent conclusion. Jesús Olmo has adapted the novel sparingly and Xavier Gens allows much of the, at times brutal and violent, imagery do the work. Certainly worth watching.",Cold Skin
4,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Finely enjoyable if somewhat flawed creature feature,8,16 July 2018,"Arriving at a remote island outpost, a lone seaman is sent to man a remote battery in the Antarctic wilderness with a rather cantankerous lighthouse keeper finds that the deformed creatures who live on the island are attacking the pair forcing them to defend their surroundings to survive.Overall, this was an incredibly fun and enjoyable offering. One of the better elements featured within this one is the incredibly strong sense of isolation and abandonment felt throughout the film. The first half, where it gets to feature the whole reasoning for his stay there where all we see him accomplish is the seemingly endless round of fumbling with the equipment for his stay or reading old journals by himself really highlight the seeming abandonment of the locale. Coupled with the creepiness of the location, from the rocky beaches and never-ending sounds of the sea crashing onto the rocks around him, create such a fine suspenseful setting here that really sells the horror effectively. Those horror scenes, which are brought up quite early on in the film, are rather fun and where the film scores it's best moments. From when he first encounters the strange creatures attempting to break into the shack soon after he arrives and spots the handiwork of their encounter as he spots the inhuman footprints in the sand afterward, that turns into the rather frantic and exciting shootout in the house where the creatures attempt to break in which causes a massive fire burning the house down during the night. The other big action scenes, featuring the creatures swarming in attack on the lighthouse which is shown to be a nightly occurrence as the series of montages showing them fortifying the location to battle swarms of creatures spilling out of the darkness and overrunning the structure only to be driven away by the morning light. The finale, with the final battle between them at the lighthouse filled with all sorts of traps and rather fun tactics they utilize to keep them at bay with their plan which has a lot to like about it and ends this on a nice high note. Coupled with the fine creature design and some solid gore against both species, there's enough to like here. While these here are incredibly fun, there are a few problems here. The most egregious issue is the unbelievably jarring and disjointed pacing that creates rather weird placings for each of the setups in the film. The first encounter with the creatures occurs not twenty minutes into the film and results in nearly burning the house down which is before we know anything at all about the creatures or anything which is a surprising feature that should come at a point where it heightens the tension of the creatures' attacks. As well, we don't really learn much about them anyway, leaving the entire sense of organization or anything about what they're like so they're a complete mystery. Otherwise, there's not much else to dislike here.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",Cold Skin
5,deloudelouvain,Original story,7,8 April 2018,"Why would people compare Cold Skin wit The Shape Of Water? It has absolutely nothing to do with eachother apart that in both cases there are some weird creatures from the sea, that's about it. The story is completely different so comparing them is just ridiculous. I thought Cold Skin was a refreshing story, not one you will ever have seen before, and for that alone it's worth watching. Okay there might be different plotholes, like why would that creature just not swim away instead of staying with that bully, but it still remains an interesting movie to watch. The main actors are Ray Stevenson and David Oakes, that are isolated on a deserted island and both find their own way to deal with their life visions. The other major actress is Aura Garrido, but she doesn't speak as she is the creature. Her make-up was really well done. There is some suspense in the story as well, as they are on constant alert of a new attack. Nice shots with good acting. To me it was a nice story, with some plotholes, but still worth giving it a go.",Cold Skin
6,Platypuschow,Cold Skin: Original but flawed,6,4 February 2019,"Cold Skin is quite the original unique little tale, but ultimately it fails to deliver on its promises.It tells the story of a military intelligence man set to do a scientific study on a remote island for a year replacing an existing gentleman. There is nobody on the island bar one, a disgruntled insane from isolation man named Gruner. As night falls he learns that the island holds a terrible secret.Arguably a ""Creature feature"" this horror stars the excellent British veteran Ray Stevenson and was made by French/Spanish studios. I'm very glad I came across it because despite its flaws it's quite remarkable, it was nice to find a movie this original and visually pleasing considering that it's not a mega budget film.The concept is outstanding, the delivery however is very mixed. They manage to make it all look good and Stevenson is on form as usual however the writing is really messy and the film simply should have flowed better.When the credits rolled I was saddened by the wasted potential here, on paper it had the makings of a fantastic feature but the end result here is something that loses steam at around the 2/3 mark and hits you with a very uninspired ending.Well worth a watch simply to marvel over what it does have to offer but it's a fine example of a ball being dropped by all involved.The Good:Solid conceptLooks greatRay StevensonThe Bad:Loses steamWasted potentialWeak finale",Cold Skin
7,paulclaassen,Awesome underrated fantasy drama.,7,10 June 2018,"Cold Skin refers to the creatures being cold blooded, and can be interpreted literally and figuratively. The action starts quickly and it is mysterious and scary in the beginning. With regards to the photography, there are some really spectacular shots. The acting by the two leading men were convincing and effective, and it was interesting to see how their opinions towards the creatures change during the course of the film. At times I did find the creature Aneris a bit too similar to 'The Shape of Water', especially when a romantic interest surfaced. The film is exceptionally well made with a beautiful subtlety to the underlying theme.And what a brilliant ending! It's all a matter of deja vu, and the film and the character's actions are much better understood. Loved it!",Cold Skin
8,Thanos_Alfie,Mystery...,6,16 June 2020,"""Cold Skin"" is an Adventure - Horror movie in which we watch a young man arriving on a remote island in order to work there as a weather observer. He will soon realize that he is not alone and he has to fight for his life.I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple and interesting plot. The interpretations of both Ray Stevenson who played as Gruner and David Oakes who played as Friend were very good and they made this movie even more interesting. Regarding the direction which was made by Xavier Gens, I have to say that he did an amazing job and he presented very well the main characters, their beliefs, their emotions and the evolution of them was also very interesting. Lastly, I have to say that ""Cold Skin"" is a good Horror movie with a lot of mystery and suspense.",Cold Skin
9,cruise01,Suspenseful and action packed.,8,2 December 2018,"Cold Skin (4 out of 5 stars).Cold Skin is a sci fi horror film that delivers with suspense and chills about a meteorologists and another guy that are stuck on an island with a lighthouse. And every night these humanoid sea creatures comes out to attack them. Lots of action, a great concept, and a fast paced direction.In 1914, a meteorologist Friend (David Oakes) travels to an island to replace the previous researcher. Except, he is nowhere to be found. He does meet the remote island's lighthouse guard played by Ray Stevenson. And he notices the lighthouse is built like a fortress like it is prepared for a battle of some kind. When night hits, Friend notices an army of humanoid sea creatures comes out of the ocean to attack him and the lighthouse. After a few attacks, he teams up with the light house guard and to hold defense against these sea creatures. He notices that the guy has one of the sea creatures befriended like a pet. How long can they hold out surviving the attacks before they both lose their minds towards each other?The plot was good. Friend and Gruner (Ray Stevenson) despise each other. But they both need each other for survival. Why is Gruner obsessed with staying on the island when a ship comes to switch the meteorologists? What really happened to the other meteorologists? These questions gets answered and it is best to see and find out in the end.There is a lot of suspenseful action that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. It is Friend's journey of being stuck on the island with a guy that is a maniac. And creatures that he has to be alert for. There can be some rough scenes to watch with Gruner abusing one of the female sea creatures. While Friend is falling for the creature.David Oakes and Ray Stevenson were both great playing their characters.Overall, Cold Skin is a good film. It is action packed. It tries for some suspenseful scares. The acting is great. And it never slows down.",Cold Skin

It has lovely atmosphere n the creatures a bit like the ones from Descent.
Inspite of the movie based on one location n only two characters, it is gripping n entertaining but once again i repeat that the ending ruined it.One of the reviewer wrote that the actors r never heard of.

12,wandernn1-81-683274,I Was Surprised By This One,7,28 January 2021,"Continuing my Amazon Prime marathon of bad movies, Cold Skin came up as a recommend. The story of a lighthouse keeper and an adventurous visitor. So the basic story is that the lighthouse is under siege from a sort of alien fish-man type humanoid from the sea. Definitely reminded me of the Sahuagin from Dungeons and Dragons.But wow, a nicely done movie. Not a whole lot of stupid stuff. Some, but not a lot. And a decent ending altho completely expected. 7/10",Cold Skin

Also reminiscent of Island of Dr. Moreau (without the experimentation). Hardly recognized Ray Stevenson. Third-billed Aura Garrido has no spoken lines.",Cold Skin
14,kevin_robbins,"This isn't a ""great"" movie, but is well done and the story is well told",6,2 May 2021,"Cold Skin (2017) is a movie I recently watched for free off Amazon Prime (it is also available for free on Tubi). The storyline focuses on two Lighthouse employees where shortly after ""the new guy"" arrives he discovers the incumbent lighthouse worker has captured an artic creature from the ocean . Night after night some of the creatures friends come to the lighthouse and tries to rescue the captured creature. This movie is directed by Xavier Gens (Frontier(s)) and stars David Oakes (The Borgias), Ray Stevenson (Thor) and Aura Garrido (Stockholm). The storyline and CGI for this felt like a better version of the film The Lighthouse with not as good acting. There are several awkward scenes that are a little ""icky"" and made me squeamish. The Arctic creatures were well done and reminded me of Abe Sapien from Hellboy. This isn't a ""great"" movie at all, but is well done and the story is well told and presented, I'm just not sure I ""loved"" the story. Overall I'd score this a 6/10 and recommend watching it once.",Cold Skin

16,henry8-3,Cold Skin,4,23 October 2018,"A man gets a dull job on a desolate island to measure wind and rain with only a crazy man and a tribe of underwater creatures seemingly bent on their destruction for company.This is certainly different and a noble attempt to make an undoubtedly Lovecraft influenced original piece. It works well to start with by building up the story narrated by the lead, however once it's clear what's going on and the creatures are out in the open it doesn't offer anything different and just keeps doing the same thing for most of the remainder of the film. The lead's motives are understood and well articulated, although those of his crazed partner are somewhat less clear.A good effort.",Cold Skin

18,Pairic,Lovecraftian Horror,8,7 October 2018,"Cold Skin: A lighthouse mystery with Lovecraftian Sea People. A friendly Irish chap named Friend (David Oakes) arrives on a remote South Atlantic island to replace the existing meteorologist but is met by the drunken lighthouse caretaker, Gruner (Ray Stevenson), who tells him that his predecessor had died of typhus. Friend finds his cabin in a state of disarray and a journal belonging to the previous meteorologist refers to strange creatures coming from the sea. Friend's house comes under attack that night but he manages to fight off the beasts.Coming to a modus vivendi with Gruner, he moves into the lighthouse. He learns that the sea people regularly attack the tower but Gruner had turned so misanthropic he turned down the opportunity to leave the island on the ship which transported Friend. Gruner keeps a docile sea woman, Aneris (Aura Garrido), as a slave/pet. Gruner and Friend fight savage battles with the sea people, slaying large numbers of them. The sea people are humanoid and appear mammalian but have gills and webbed feet and hands. Their hands have fearsome talons and their teeth are more fanglike, they see the humans as invaders on their homeland. Gruner and Friend both have their reasons for leaving civilisation behind and are convincingly portrayed by Stevenson and Oakes, while she cannot speak Aneris communicates her feelings, while subservient to Gruner, she snarls at him when he shoves Friend. She has both animal and human aspects, well depicted by Garrido.Director Xavier Gens delivers an effective horror film with cinematographer providing bleak daytime scenes counterposed with nighttime attacks by the sea people in flickering light and shadow. The Sea People were designed by Arturo Balseiro with prosthetics by Sebastian Lochmann and Raquel Manuero. 8/10. On Netflix.",Cold Skin
19,TdSmth5,Iceland is nice; the movie stinks.,4,27 January 2019,"Some guy arrives at a volcanic island in the early 1900s to replace the weather officer (later called signals officer) there. There's a light house nearby inhabited by some mad jerk. Apparently the previous officer just left and never returned. As guy makes himself comfortable in his residence he's suddenly attacked by some creatures. In trying to defend himself he manages to set the house on fire and burns it down.He then seeks help from the jerk in the lighthouse who's not at all interested buy eventually allows guy to live there as long as he helps kill the creatures which attack the lighthouse nearly every night. At first dumb guy freezes and can't even shoot his rifle. But eventually he settles into the routine of fetching water, wood, and killing creatures at night. It also turns out that the jerk keeps one of the creatures as a pet that he can kick around. But there's also something unsavory going on between the jerk and the creature. Guy sort of warms up to the creature, it's not clear how much but he may also have crossed the line. Guy is apparently happy with the routine and doesn't even bother to explore the island. It takes the creature to show him an abandoned rowboat. Jerk isn't interested until he suggests grabbing some dynamite which is on sunk ship. Guy gets to put on some archaic diving suit and the two get the dynamite.Jerk's only motivation to keep going is exterminating the creatures. So he's delighted about the dynamite. Winter is also arriving. There's some more drama between the three, till finally there's the inevitable resolution to this and something of a surprise ending.With Cold Skin Xens returns to his favorite theme--human ugliness. Jerk is just too much of a jerk, madness and all. In the meantime the creature serves to tear at our heartstrings. And the constant loud ridiculous orchestrated music is just sickening. But in the absence of any reasonable dialogue and normalcy filmmakers just love exposing us to a slow motion concert--of nearly two hours. And yes, Iceland is beautiful. But surely there's more to see there than just the same 5 sights this movies shows. Based on a book, this movie doesn't do it any favors. Better not to ask why on earth stuff happens the way it does or the way it doesn't. Somewhere there was material for a decent movie, but the scriptwriters, the director, and production fail this time around.",Cold Skin
20,peterp-450-298716,"First ""The shape of water"" and now this. Something fishy going on?",4,7 March 2018,"""We are never very far from those we hate.
For this very reason, we shall never be truly close to those we love.""This film is as vague as the reason why the nameless young man (David Oakes) seeks refuge on a rocky island in the Antarctic Ocean. Initially, he has to relieve another meteorologist. But the question of the captain for what he's running away, remains unanswered. Did he do anything wrong during WWI? Or is an unrequited love driving him to this isolated island? No idea. And in the end, this isn't important anyway. The problem is that the man he needs to replace, is nowhere to be seen. The only living soul still present on the island is the primitive looking loner Gruner (Ray Stevenson) who's hiding in a lighthouse.Gruner isn't very talkative. But soon the young man realizes that his safety isn't guaranteed at night when water creatures start crawling out of the ocean. When the meteorologist sees his accommodation go up in flames after the first evening, he's forced to stay with Gruner in the lighthouse. There he discovers that Gruner keeps such a female amphibious creation (Aura Garrido) as a kind of pet. She serves as a maid and as a sex object who's being abused by Gruner. The reason why the creatures attack the lighthouse at night is rather unclear. Are these attacks a need of conquest? Or are these rescue missions?I wouldn't call it a horror. Or should the used symbolism frighten the viewer? A symbolisme that shows how man behaves towards strangers and even towards those it knows. Is it a reflection of the brutality we know in our society? The suppression of other individuals and the abuse that comes with it. Eventually you are wondering who the monster is here. The ones who abuse a helpless being from the sea? Or the creatures who storm the lighthouse every night? Some admiration for the acting of Stevenson. He succeeds in showing that cruelty and madness in an excellent way.I wasn't really impressed by this film. The story isn't really overwhelming and tends to be repetitive after a while. Despite the action-packed attacks and a few jump scares, this is ultimately just an average film. And the comparison with ""The shape of water"" is quite striking. The eradication of a fish-like being for self-profit and sexual interaction between this being and someone of the human race can be found in both films. The only difference is that in ""Cold Skin"" it's a whole bunch of those ocean dwellers.",Cold Skin
21,robertemerald,Highly entertaining and original sci-fi,9,17 February 2019,"There are layers to this movie, a sort of double message. It's as much about domestic violence and respecting Nature as about monsters. Don't confuse this picture with The Shape of Water, although it is a very clever movie. It's taken some of the best imagery from classic zombie footage and given it a fresh and yet classic appeal, and as it's not zombies we can even, and here's a lark, feel something for another species. The creature effects are excellent, as is the astute use of cgi. The time period is clever too, a sort of pathos. The sense of being lost, as in lost in a desert or lost in space or shipwrecked on an island, is also profound, and the clash of gentlemanly manners heightens one's awareness of this fact, and is brilliantly delivered by the energetic leads. This is not a B-movie, or an indie, it's too professional for that. There is too much smart imagery, writing and direction. I would have liked to have seen a more wintery climate, complete with storms and clashing elements, and I dock this piece a point for that (the action is, after all, about survival). The soundscape was clean and appropriate without being intrusive, the plot makes perfect sense if you accept the premise (any sci-fi fan easily will), it's not overly long and the ending is an appropriate sense of justice and loss and deeper thoughts and feelings. I enjoyed it from literally the first brilliant seconds. All up, for me, Cold Skin is almost perfect.",Cold Skin

24,Foutainoflife,??,4,17 February 2019,"I may be in the minority but I feel like there isn't much of a story to this. We have a dude who goes to an island to be a weather watchman. There is also a lighthouse on the island that is occupied by a rather unfriendly fellow who has fortified the lighthouse with sharp stakes. The man soon learns that their are bipedal aquatic beings who storm the house every night with what seems to be an attempt to kill. After he burns down the house, he is forced to try and find shelter in the lighthouse. He and the lighthouse keeper will spend the rest of the film at war with many of these creatures and having sexual relations with one.Needless to say, this is a movie that has a bit of weird to it. I wanted to give it a try since it was a marketed as a horror film and I'm always willing to check flicks out in hopes of finding a few hidden gems. This movie just fell really short. It wasn't that it wasn't filmed or acted well. My problem is that you are never really given any insight into why all of it was happening.There is the initial impression that the creatures attack to possibly feed or simply kill. A little later on, there is the casual hint that the attacks may be the result of the female living in the lighthouse and getting her freak on with the old man. Then there is a moment where there was an attempt at some sort of truce but that all just seemed strange because I was still unsure why they were at odds to begin with.I've not read the book but I don't consider myself to be an idiot or unable to comprehend what I am being shown. I guess that this is just not a film for everyone and I am in that crowd. It may also be that I don't consider this to be a horror film. I see it as more as dramatic sci-fi. I'm not too crazy about sci-fi.My final thoughts are simple. If you've read the book and liked it, you may very well enjoy this. If you are into sci-fi, you may like it too. If you are looking for horror, I'm not sure if this will leave you satisfied.",Cold Skin

His only company is a haggard lighthouse keeper and the swarm of mermen who try to kill him. This film has lots of sides to it.
It is very beautiful, the cast and acting is great.
The characters are true men of their age and have that real Victorian lust to conquer the world about them.There is lots of action, yet the film is very slow.
The big battles are interspersed by long shorts of icy waves crashing and interactions between the main characters.
Quite often in the middle of it all kicking off the camera will pan away from the action to a wall getting splattered with blood then the sun rising.There is an awful lot of subtext going in this film - it's just I don;t think I am clever enough to get it.
I feel like there were themes on imperialism, and the destructive nature of man and the relationships between the genders but I could equally just be imagining it.An enjoyable watch, but slow and measured - save it for another time if you are not feeling patient.",Cold Skin
27,juanmuscle,I thought this was very interesting...,10,15 January 2019,"Based on a book, of which I do not know; but it must be a fine book for this was a fine tale. At first I was like what in hell are these things , for they appear to be fiendish creatures from the sea no less, that is very very scary indeed! But as the tale unfolds there is a very cute sea creature who is not only voluptuous but rather sweet but seemingly her nature is of one similar to a domesticated beast; intelligence is not really their strong suit; perhaps there are no schools under the sea lol; but nevertheless the cute creature seems to be willing to learn by its intimations here and there. Now we come to the Lighthouse character; golly is this guy creepy, but we surely say, it is because of the creepier sea creatures for they are fiendish no?Why I think this is a must watch is mainly for one reason, I don't think violence , beating people or sea creatures , or sentient beings to wield and mold them into what we consider to be proper is the answer.Second, we get a feeling from the beginning that the character joining this situation here at this juncture in time is filled with condition ideology that lends to the manifestation of fear and anxiety for these beings as when we see him reading the literature composed by the last person.The only thing I do not understand is why these seemingly really incredible creatures from the sea, as they are showcased during the third act, attack at the expense of losing so many of their own? I mean the only real question is that we don't know enough about them to truly understand what they want with the island and or is it all just an old grudge perpetuating itself in an ever ongoing reprisal towards that creepy Light House fellow?Even though there are not enough answers, I think its for the best, as the moral and all the fine subconscious points the film imparts remains lurking about ominously and deeply hauntingly forever after experiencing this thing!",Cold Skin
28,spookyrat1,Another That Got Away!,6,2 March 2019,"Cold Skin is another example of that type of movie that gets many of the production fundamentals right, so that initially you'll think you're in for a good sitting with an understated, underrated film, only to realise well into the screening that you've been dudded.Being set in an isolated unforgettable location, whose rugged scenery is beautifully captured by cinematographer Daniel Aranyó, Cold Skin is another of that growing sub-genre of films, which feature a short cast list; in this instance, essentially just three lead characters, who are well cast and give fine, convincing performances. To be sure there are plenty of other characters seen, but I think CGI was generally employed to feature them. It should be noted too that the special effects in a clearly low to medium budget release are extremely functional.The main problem with the film is the rather baffling storyline, which unfortunately in this oceanic-inspired tale, is filled with holes, that appear big enough to sail a boat through. And this in itself is strange as many of the other armchair critics of this film claim it is almost adapted to the most exact detail from the award winning novel by Albert Sanchez Pinol.Set as it is in 1914 around the outbreak of World War 1 hostilities, I can well accept that the film as a whole represents an example of the futility and losses involved in waging war. But one has a right to ask how this war began? Why do the creatures continue to fight a war in which they always seem to be suffering significant losses? What do they hope to achieve? Why are they actually losing when we see they are so much quicker, agile and both athletically and aquatically inclined than their two solitary human opponents? Why are they supposedly collectively inhibited by daylight, when we see Aneris being untroubled by the day. Speaking of Aneris why does she continue to hang around Gruner, when she is so obviously being used and abused? There is some throw away line late in the piece about him freeing her from a net or something, but this film (and by inference the book) suffers maddeningly from a lack of background details.A number of the film's staunch advocates I see, are suggesting you need to read the book to (possibly) get those sort of questions answered. Such comments are quite bizarre. An adapted film should exist and be reasonably understood on its own merits, not dependent on reading some previous book to be fully comprehended. Cold Skin as it stands therefore is just like another unhooked, but inviting big fish, swimming off into the impenetrable ocean depths, after playing teasingly for a brief time with our baited lines.",Cold Skin

36,phenomynouss,a solid 6 type movie,6,13 March 2021,"I guess maybe I just wasn't as moved as others by this film. It was, overall, neat. Had some neat moments and interesting concepts, but it plays very light and airy with it all. There's a lot of moments where you basically think ""wow, that's kind of deep"" then laugh at the idea. But the film doesn't take its superficial navel-gazing seriously enough to be worthy of mockery.
At the same time, there's just not much there in terms of theme or purpose. A man with no name volunteers to stay on a tiny barren island where a grizzled, bitter old man Mr Gruner is tending to a lighthouse. Sometimes at night, swarms of aquatic-looking humanoids attack the lighthouse and Gruner shoots at them, kills a bunch, and they eventually scurry off after eating some of their dead or otherwise taking them away.
This becomes a slight routine with Gruner and the man with no name, his Friend, as some nights they don't attack. It all seems somehow connected to a female aquanoid they call ""Aneris"" who just kind of meanders around with them, chewing on random stuff and stands on the lighthouse making loud noises whenever the other aquanoids attack.
There's not a whole lot done with the film beyond this, relying a lot on a grim, moody atmosphere with gentle music and ruminations about how the lighthousekeepers are the evil ones here, having invaded the island that apparently belongs to the aquatic humanoids.
But beyond that, there's not much here. It's not particularly deep or meaningful, but it also doesn't try to be, so there's not much lost and it doesn't come across as pretentious.",Cold Skin
37,bregund,Unrecognizable actors=B movie,4,5 April 2021,"One sign that a movie blows it that it features actors you've never heard of, because the script was passed around to the A-listers and they all said no; yes they're largely a bunch of airheads but when it comes to scripts they have a keen sense for what works and what doesn't. A group of sea-monkeys terrorizes two men on a remote island, that's the story. There's lots of licking, nudity, and subjugation, all of which is nauseating. If you want to see a naked, flabby, middle-aged man for nearly two hours, you're in luck. There's no ultimate message or payoff, no clever twist, no commentary about society in general, just a couple of dopes who serve no clear purpose, fighting a battle with the sea-monkeys, whose motivation is never clear. They have the entire ocean, why do they want the lighthouse? Oh, and of course unlike almost every single sea creature in existence, they don't like the light, any light, so they only come out at night. That's convenient, isn't it?

52,S_Soma,Beautifully made but incredibly sloppy storytelling.,4,12 February 2018,"Short opening preview:COLD SKIN opens with scenes of a young man, whose name is Friend, on the deck of a tramp steamer bound, as we are to learn, for a remote island where he is to perform duties as a weather observer for a term of 12 months. The aged and worn Capt. of the clanking old vessel, Capt. Axel, chats with Friend on the deck with surprising kindness. Colorfully, Friend observes that the captain treats him with the felicitousness of the executioner for the condemned.Almost immediately, we arrive at Friend's island destination, an intensely desolate place with almost no vegetation, all volcanic rocks with a little sand. Incongruously perched like a wart on an otherwise featureless face, the small cabin Friend is to call home for the next 12 months squats not far from the shore, surrounded by the few constructs necessary to support Friend's weather observation activities. A few sailors carry Friend's meager belongings into the cabin which appears in a bit more disarray than one would expect. Friend is supposed to replace the existing weather observer, but the present occupant of the cabin is nowhere to be found.Capt. Axel sends the sailors away and then he and Friend go to a lighthouse some distance away in hopes of questioning the lighthouse operator as to the whereabouts of the existing weather observer. Upon arriving at the lighthouse, we see a most unusual structure. The lighthouse and its immediate surrounds are bristling with sharp sticks and festooned with other such unwelcoming accoutrement at every possible point of attachment. No one answers the door even after much yelling and pounding at the door.Breaking in, Friend and Capt. Axel discover the lighthouse operator upstairs, passed out naked, apparently from too much drink. Friend and Capt. Axel rouse the lighthouse operator who gives every indication of being exceptionally hostile and unstable. As for the missing weather observer, the only explanation they get from the lighthouse operator, who we learn is named Gruner, are some vague mumblings about his having died from disease.Friend and Capt. Axel return to Friend's own cabin where Capt. Axel attempts to dissuade Friend from remaining in this awful place just one final time. Friend refuses and the pair bid each other a pleasant farewell.That very night, Friend hears someone or something moving about immediately outside his cabin. He tentatively calls out to who he assumes is Gruner, but there is no answer. Startlingly, a dark, gray-green webbed hand reaches probingly beneath the cabin door. Understandably horrified, Friend immediately and enthusiastically stabs it with a knife. And so Friend's nightmare begins.Review:From the very first scene, COLD SKIN immediately impresses with its production values. The music is excellent and atmospheric, the cinematography is engaging and colorful with an almost Jules Vern-esque adventure feel, and the actors are colorful and well played. The special-effects/CGI are first-rate. The island setting is superbly appropriate for the subject matter and is so desolate it feels frightening just sitting there, doing nothing. So, for most aspects of its production, COLD SKIN gets a solid 10/10.Unfortunately, and in my opinion most disappointingly, the entire thing falls flat due to a storyline that is utter unmitigated, illogical rubbish. The movie wishes to pile-drive us in the face with a morality tale about xenophobia, apparently, and is willing to corrupt its own storyline to the point of utter nonsense in order to do it. The net effect is a storyline that, if you think about it for more than 5 seconds, makes absolutely no sense.Why are the fish-people willing to mindlessly throw themselves in mass attacks against the lighthouse night after night only to be killed by the score? What are they after? The land is not their domain of interest and even if it was there are no resources there as it is utterly barren. If it's the fish-girl that's keeping company with Gruner that's attracting them, what's so special about her? If the fish-girl is causing the attacks, does she not care that her brethren are being killed by the busload every night? Why do the fish-people only attack at night when it's abundantly clear they're perfectly happy to be out in the daylight? Why does Gruner say they fear the light when they obviously don't? Why does the fish-girl want to keep company with humans who treat her like garbage? She's not being held prisoner in any way and has access to the water whenever she wants. Why does Gruner, who has been working diligently to massacre them by the hundreds for the entire picture, suddenly walk out the door at the end and allow himself to be torn to pieces? I only stop here arbitrarily; this list could go on indefinitely.Movies can be highly stylized to the point of apparent insanity (BRAZIL, THE 9TH CONFIGURATION, etc.) and still have perfectly functional stories with which to tell their morality tales without fundamentally trashing the basic mechanisms and properties of decent storytelling. In a movie, even apparent insanity has to be carefully crafted and constructed, controlled and sculpted. It can't be shoveled out and thrown at the viewer like a monkey throwing poo at passersby at a zoo.And, sadly, in its zeal to hit us over the head with its moral, that's pretty much what COLD SKIN is like.Update 2/21/2018: Some have suggested to me that a reading of the original book from which COLD SKIN is derived might clarify my many irritations with respect to the story. This is a wholly unsuitable suggestion for numerous reasons, though I will only name a few. Firstly, barring exigent circumstances, a movie should stand on its own and should not rely on information ""not in evidence"". There are certain situations, such as the Star Wars franchise, where there are so many stories and sub-stories that make up the overall arc that are revealed in so many different kinds of media (animation, books, audio recordings, etc.) that one is obviously expected to explore these other elements to obtain the full sense of the franchise. COLD SKIN is not one of those circumstances. It is simply a poor story poorly expressed. If one MUST read the book to understand the movie, why see the movie?I suffered enough with the movie and so, truthfully, I have not read the book. A friend of mine, however, has. I put some of the collection of questions I have regarding the overall story to my friend and she was not any more able to answer them than I was with the movie with the single exception of the question as to why the Sitauca (the formal name of the fish/frog/whatever people) incessantly attack the weatherman and the lighthouse keeper; it was for the warm meat. This of course makes obvious sense; innumerable hundreds of at least semi-sentient beings would obviously be willing to sacrifice themselves for only 2 food kills at best. Uh-Huh.In short, the book form of COLD SKIN adds more, and I am told repetitive, detail but little if any more clarity. The story is a self-indulgence of an author that is primarily an anthropologist possessed of Deep Meanings he wishes to express. There are some 7.6 billion people in the world and it is inevitable that there will be a few who share the author's peculiar brand of moral navel contemplation; others will be less impressed. Reading the book illuminates issues only for the predisposed.",Cold Skin

57,scottmannen1,"Art House. Entertaining, yes. Horror, no. Thriller, no. Drama, maybe. See this only if you enjoy art flicks!",6,21 June 2019,"Surprising is how I describe this movie. Why? The movie was marketed as a thriller/horror film, which it certainly is not. It's not a comedy, it's not a horror movie, nor is it an action movie. The best way I can describe this film is to classify it as an Art House/Drama movie. It doesn't clearly fit into any of the normal classifications! For that fact alone the director and writer deserve some praise because that makes this movie original. So few original movies coming out of Hollyweird these days! The closest movie out there that is almost a carbon copy of this movie is X Machina. Why do I say this? In the movie X Machina spins the movie around 3 people the same as this movie. The people are all in isolation from the world- check again. Both low budget films of decent quality featuring fairly well known actors that for their parts do a very good job of acting. The similarities are very close! Here I was just saying that this movie was unique right before I go on a tirade about how it's the same as another film! Beyond my contradictory points, it is still a very original movie.Now if you aren't an Art House movie fan you are definitely going to have issues with this film. I myself am not really into Art House films. After attempting to watch David Lynch's Inland Empire Art House film I decided to never watch Art House again! Luckily this film is nowhere near the Art insanity of Inland Empire. That being said, I still enjoyed Cold Skin because it wasn't too Artsy for me. In fact the movie starts out quite normally...It starts out with a man getting dropped off for a one year tour of duty as a lighthouse technician. When he arrives it's discovered the main house is dusty and in dis-array as if no one has been there in many years. That's when they find the islands lone occupant living in the lighthouse. Bruno the occupant is simply crazy from having cabin fever due to years in isolation. The captain warns the new technician that something is wrong on this island and that he should not stay. His warning ignored and he leaves.We quickly discover that every night these lizard people from the ocean attack the lighthouse in an attempt to kill Bruno. Thousands of them every single night. Now here is where it starts getting artsy as the lizard people are undoubtedly meant to represent something else and the technician is supposed to recognize colonialism that crushes their enemies before attempting peace. I won't spoil any of the story for you, but it's all symbolism and goes straight into full on Art House symbolism where ""friend"" stays with them and magically appears and disappears throughout the remainder of the film. There is no horror or scary scenes. In fact, what we end up with is a mediocre film that is disjointed and due to the Art House attempts the film itself becomes a disjointed story with plot holes and a story that is not well written.As this film still manages to be entertaining there is some value in that. The writing could have been much better than what we got. I mean it seems like the story even could have been filmed but it's almost like the producers removed the critical scenes in the story that connected everything together! It's a real shame as I feel that this could have been a fantastic 7.5/10 if only the story was actually completed better and connected the dots. A real shame. So bottom line is don't watch this movie if you are looking for a great film. This is more of a bored on Saturday afternoon movie to watch when there is nothing else to watch! Do yourself a favour and go into this one with low expectations and you may enjoy yourself! Otherwise I would avoid this one.",Cold Skin

But after opening well, it quickly goes into the rough and never recovers. Lots of problems - all serious. All tension is lost early on, once the ""cold skin"" is revealed. The storyline barely develops at all, the characters aren't interesting, events shown have no logic, it's very repetitive. It tries to make a point about human nature, but labours this far beyond breaking point through repetitive violence, which has no impact.

It's a testament to how engrossing the rest of the movie is that I can still recommend this film, despite how disappointing the end is.It could have chosen so, so many things to be, I'm so confused about what this crew must have been thinking they were doing. If you're one of those people for whom having things explained is what defines your enjoyment of a film, do NOT watch this. You will be...furious. Absolutely furious. Much goes undiscussed, much more underdiscussed. And not in the way that suggests the filmmaker intended to not discuss things. No, it is rife with endless, confusing omissions and failures, usually of things that, any one of which, would be the defining aspect of another film.I still really enjoyed it.

In spite of the fact that only three actors are in the majority of the movie. It does keep the viewer involved. However, there are so many unanswered questions, that in my opinion are never really answered in full. I found it odd that one of the main characters contributes a voice over during parts of the movie. But when a voice over could offer some explanation as to what is occurring, nothing is said. Further, in the final scenes, the viewer is left on their own to figure out what the ending means. The creature design works well, and the actress playing one of the creatures. Does a very good job making her character interesting, and unusual at the same time. There really could have been more done with the basic premise of the film.",Cold Skin
79,sagniknath,Decent atmospheric film centered around the theme of isolation,7,11 February 2018,"I have always been a fan of sci-fi/speculative films that tend to have a minimal cast against the backdrop of an expansive setting. In this regard, Cold Skin is very reminiscent of Oblivion and Ex Machina. All these films had at most three main characters interacting with one another in an isolated but very vast picturesque location . The wide landscape serves to contrast with the localized affairs of these individuals. So the main hook for me was this setup. Story-wise, the film tackles primarily two issues: isolation and xenophobia. Both the two male characters have escaped to the desolation of a lonely island having only two human establishments, a cottage and a lighthouse, in hope of running from some burden or repercussion they left behind in society.As such , they try to make the best they can out of mixing with each other and with a female of a native anthropomorphic aquatic species. In fact, I would say this is where the film comes very close in terms of plot point to Ex Machina, which also featured a very palpable tension in the relationship between the two male characters and the female robot. However, Ex Machina carried this storyline to a more concrete resolution. I felt as if Cold Skin didn't try this hard enough and sort of rushed it up towards the film's end. The topic of xenophobia is also brought up with the aquatic creatures clearly being stand ins for the natives of nations colonized by European Imperialism. The film tries to balance the views towards these creatures as both classical savages with an intent to kill the white man as well as natives trying to protect their homeland against colonialism. Although I had never heard of the actors before, I was never a moment bored by the performances and the good pacing of the movie. Overall, definitely a film to check out and one not deserving of the abysmally low rating on ImdB : 5.8/10 (as of the time of writing this review)",Cold Skin

The movie tries to shows that when we go to a new area for us, find a new group of people different from us, that we then force our ways or destroy them. You could say it is just like the colonist to America or whites to Africa, but the fact remains that people, tribes or armies as far back as history recalls, take over a new land and force their ways.

Kids now talk about war as if it's a 'gaming experience' - it's not. The brutality, the violence, the emotions felt when playing a game are nothing, NOTHING in comparison.

And though this wasn't exactly the movie I wanted it to be, I was satisfied with it. Firstly, this movie is extremely well-made and acted. The location is simply wonderful. I would've preferred the sea creatures to be more grotesque but that wasn't what they were aiming for. This film doesn't explain everything which leaves you thinking about it which works well in this case. I enjoyed too which leads the viewer to wonder just how long the lighthouse keeper had been there and who the original lighthouse keeper was. Not surprisingly, this movie is based on a rather popular foreign novel which received a bit of praise and attention which it apparently is quite faithful to.",Cold Skin

The actors were superb in getting across their characters - even their character's subconscious was shown - a side the characters probably weren't even aware of.

The sexual relationship with what is basically a slave master and his creature slave, was horrible. I'm not sure why I finished watching this film even though at some point, I started doing work on my PC while watching because the film just couldn't hold my full attention. Even half watching was too much as this film left a really bad taste in my mouth. I went to bed after watching this film, feeling a little sick in my soul.

That he was in it was enough for me to watch.The story of 1 or 2 people in a very remote and hostile location, with strange happenings around them, is one that has been told many times in many different films, but Cold Skin does very well at not being just a retread of those. The chaotic relationship between the 2 men maintains tension throughout the film. (semi-spoiler here) How one of them evolves over time and the other doesn't makes this much more than the usual dark-of-night creature feature. There's a message in the film about the nature of humans, too, and not a flattering one, but it's also handled a bit more subtly, without the heavy-handed preaching other films fall victim to.Good film -- definitely worth the time.",Cold Skin
98,MTZink,Interesting Descent Into Utter Stupidity,6,29 January 2021,"Even the most grand and atmospheric backdrops can be overwhelmed but the sheer insanity closer to the viewer. Here we have another wonderous waste of acting talent and concept because both screenwriters (and apparantly original author of the derived book) are either too lazy, incapable or outright uncaring to make complete sense of their material.
Da hell is it with so-called ""creative"" works these days? Seriously, I want to know. Because all I see is the above fails that should never pass muster. We're talking about the basic LOGIC as expressed by other reviewers that totally and completely destroy the movie. You've been there. Start out fresh and interesting, then things start to stretch and next thing you know, you're grooming your cat or trimming your nails while the movie drones on in the background. To wit:
1. More ""rubber suit""/makeup monsters. Bipedal humanoids. Gills or fangs notwithstanding... yawn.
2. Illogic swamps all; pure animalistic predators or hinting at primitive cultures. Either would be fast extinct through their own stupidity as follows.
3. Mass night attacks for zero apparant purpose. Not even predators risk much; these idiots sustain nothing but death, gunshots and hatchet hacks for zero reward, supposedly again and again, each night. Other reviewers note the book sez it's for the ""warm meat"" inside while others suggest/hint at the female mascot hanging with the humans for some unknown reason/lame excuse despite near constant abuse, including freaky sexual ... er, incidents that I really don't care to examine for whatever message is intended.
4. Speaking of these nightly attacks, they seem to be deliberately triggered and/or given a solid ""START"" signal via one guy shooting off a flare. Looks great but again: WTF? Seriously: bam! Flare shoots off from lighthouse into water... pause ... instant monster attacks. Same sequence of events shown several times. No variation. Which offers as many questions as this whole review could cover. Why? What started THAT? Why do they wait for the convenient ""We're ready to shoot you down"" signal? Why have a signal at all? What happens if you, oh I don't know, simply DO NOT shoot a flare off at night? Would they not attack? Eventually fall asleep, checking their waterproof Timexes again and again, wondering why things were delayed?
5 or have I lost count? Anyway, the attacks come at night because we're told they fear the light. Yet use a flare to attack, show up in broad daylight at other times and never a problem.
? - Da hell is up with that Gruner guy anyway? Why never mention the nightly attacks when the new guy arrives to stay in a separate cottage about a mile away from the formal lighthouse ... which, suspiciously, is fortified with sharp stakes ala Walking Dead? Why doesn't the new guy ASK about that stuff?
?? - Back to the cottage. Previous weather observer got munched or otherwise fell victim to fish monsters. Yet nothing is out of place. Ok, previous dude may have been grabbed w/o fuss. By the way they attack the lighthouse, I'd assume this place would be ransacked out of pure anger alone but perhaps a pass on that BECAUSE, back to the fortified wood spikes on lighthouse: it's a remote volcanic island w/o vegatation seen besides lichen. That's a lotta driftwood.
AND WHY? These are manlike creatures that swarm in large masses. If not for the convenient steps added by the spike poles, I can see no way they could carry out their nightly scramble all the way up a couple stories of smooth stone for battles at the top.
Better wrap this up. Other quickies:
Gruner leaves new dude out on balcony during first attack for ... reasons. A hazing or rather brutal tough love lesson on what they really faced, I guessed. Another ""cool scene"" but each top balcony battle I saw was like World War Z's Jerusalem wall scene OR too many Resident Evil plays where I get overconfident only to be swarmed by the undead. As orcs swarming the castle, it was all they could do to fight them off left, right and center. Doubtful new dude would have survived. Wholly uninjured at that.Back to WHY the baddies attack at all. They live in the ocean. Glimpses of the swarms suggest close to a hundred each time ... that's a lot but the sea is... well, BIG. The grand vistas of the volcanic seashore stretching into the misty distance of this remote island only made me think of the sheer logistics required to concentrate attention on one little piece of shore. There was no goal, no motivation to break away from normal life to wander back and mass up at one place.In short, simply too much made too little sense.",Cold Skin

I think the crew did a great job conveying a sense of isolation in a forgotten and virtually unknown section of the world. The cinematography and acting was well done in my opinion, more so the cinematography than acting. There were some themes about war, enemies and the duality of human violence and empathy that were well presented. The more I think about this movie the more I like it. I'd give it a 6.7/10.

This creature is all what the movie is about. She shows how much she can be differnet than her own species, no matter how aggressive they might seem, she showed us the other face of their ""culture"", the face of a kind being, even better than humans.
Friend was very like all humans, he wants to be good but he is controlled by some desperate man who wants to proclaim himself owner of the island, even though he admits being the invader, the enemy, the new comer, the strange one.

Set the film on a remote island where our two protagonists are stuck for a year with dwindling supplies. Also add a 'Shape Of Water' element but with an abusive inter species relationship..and finally add fantastic actor Ray Stevenson whom I have loved since I first became aware of him in the series 'Rome'.
 On top of everything the visual effects are very good..the soundtrack is commanding..and the remote island and lighthouse are a major aspect in themselves.

It is not a diamond in the rough, hidden, cult horror film. It is just bad, all the way through. The story in its essence might have been worth a 6/10, but once you add the actual writing (that ranges from bland to hysterically bad) and the non-sensical scene cuts, you find yourself wading slowly out into a weird ocean of nothingness. You want it to fix itself but it never does. It is all pain for no pay off. Just spare yourself the agony of the slow, miserable death that is watching this movie.",Cold Skin

In fact, there's a big mistake hiding the background story in the film that made it lack of content and nonsense itself. The book shows a background of each of the characters, Friend was a soldier escaping from memories and consequences of a civil war in Ireland, Grüner....well Grüner is not Grüner himself, and the ""toads"" (monsters) has its own story behind as well the island has its own secret. All of them shows a mirror of our own society but you cannot see neither of this in the film...Amazing book if you love something to think later.

I could literally stop the movie at whatever moment take a screen shot and make it a wallpaper! The script is very good as well, every dialog/narration is like reading from a book.

It has overtones of 'The Shape of Water' and 'Alien', along with a touch of 'Fort Apache the Bronx' and DiCaprio's 'Revenant'...The cinematography is first-rate, the acting is excellent, and the writing was at least 'on-par' for the movie's other attributes. I think the 'sex' aspect could have been shelved, it wasn't needed to keep the movie flowing, but then again...I guess they felt they needed it to 'compete with Shape of Water'...who knows.Definitely worth the money to rent and see, if you like 'cold, lonely, survival' combined with that melancholy, 'what comes next?' feeling that such a movie instills. If you liked 'Alien', if you saw 'Shape of Water', and if you found 'Revenant's' survival theme interesting...you'll at least 'like' this if not love it!",Cold Skin

I have not yet looked at online threads about this movie, of which I'm sure there are some, and not just at IMDB. But I won't demote my rating because the ending perhaps eluded me.

Although there is lots of blood, violence and even sex, the film's focus is none of these. The core is emotional and sensual. A lot of production value is in the wonderful photography and color correction. Gorgeous low key imagery of the sea dominates from beginning to end. The orchestral score, the set design and the acting are all on par. Without sea creatures this could have been a Victorian period piece.",Cold Skin

146,whoacalm,Usual white savior storyline,1,25 February 2021,"Awesome cinematography but the usual storyline. Hard not to be reminded of Pocahontas, Sarah Baartman, Sally Hemmings (or the multitude of others) in this story. Abusive white guy takes on female of a race of beings that he despises as a concubine and becomes solely motivated to maintain his dominance over her (and pleasuring himself) while at the same time committed to completely eradicating her species. Joined by a less abusive white guy who also ends up pleasuring himself with female and wanting to protect her from the first abusive white guy (since we have become intimate after all) while joining in the attempted genocide of her people and helping devise a plan where we possibly can eradicate them all (dynamite). Female so overcome by the physical attributes of her captors/rescuers that she endures punishment and cowers like a dog for most of the movie yet never takes advantage of the numerous opportunities to save herself or her people by killing him or helping her people to even though she's obviously swimming with them at least on occasion. Just a 2020 version of the Cowboy movies I watched growing up where the mindless Native Americans just continued wave after wave attacking the stage coaches in a circle or the mindless Zulus with the cowskin shields getting mowed down in the movie Zulu.

A poetic, thrilling, dramatic and at moments, scary experience with a superb cast (don't let the fact there's only two of them scare you away - this duo carries the movie fantastically!), beautiful scenery, and a terrific soundtrack.

The movie is filled with subtle details, facial expressions and body language that leaves an enormous impression. How these details have been transformed from script to reality is astonishing. And no, I'm not someone who's part of the film, I'm actually a Norwegian woman who values movies with a deeper meaning. Movies like «Cold Skin» does not come around very often, and this is actually my very first review. 
If you're simple minded and want easy and fast entertainment, this movie is not for you. You have to be someone who pays attention to details, and someone who have the ability to see the movie in its entirery to appreciate it. Just an advice. It's not pure science fiction/entertainment. It's a movie that is supposed to make you think about humanity and the different aspects of human behaviour.",Cold Skin

-Friedrich NietzscheFor those of you who are thinking about watching this movie and assume it's just about the beginning of The Great War, Amphibious people and/or the story of a man driven crazy on a remote island are in for a rude awakening. This movie is an allegory of the colonization of militarized white men to foreign lands. The Amphibious Indigenous people are the terrorized, unassuming souls of an island remotely touched by humans. WWI is barely spoken of in this movie. You only become more aware of it by the final scene which I assume is due to it being 1914. Gruner has no qualms about treating an indigenous female as if she were a dog. He rapes her, kicks her, beats her. Yet he thinks that SHE and her people are the barbarians. If it wasn't for Friend (David Oakes) this movie would have no redeeming qualities. Each scene I hoped that Gruner would turn more civilized only to be horribly disappointed. I believe Gruner wanted the people to continue to attack just so he could continue to exterminate them. The Nietzsche quote in the beginning fits this movie/book quite well. I can only assume that since the war brought many more men to the island, that the rest of the indigenous people would be raped/murdered/bred out and/or completely wiped out. Which is reminiscent of what other cultures have had to endure.",Cold Skin
