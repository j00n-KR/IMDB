0,kosmasp,Anthology and then some,9,16 April 2021,"What makes a horror anthology a good one? We know that the stories in between have to be decent - but what also matters: to have something that really feels like a good story surrounding it all. VHS tried that to a degree and I reckon you could say it served its purpose. But in this case here, it is more than just a simple thing to accompany the other things that are being said.I was not able to watch this at a cinema but did get my hands on a 4k release. This really looks beautiful! Even more of an achievement if you think how small the budget must have been (see also behind the scenes). Nice stories and really good actors get a great treatment (two dps apparently as the director states, which is not a bad thing in an anthology)! So all the elements work nicely together - you just should not be ... easily offended and grossed out too quick. While the nudity is ""missing"" or a non issue, this is quite vivid when it comes to the violence ... can you dig it?",The Mortuary Collection
1,paul_haakonsen,An atmospheric horror anthology...,7,27 February 2021,"Well, this was definitely a horror anthology that had atmosphere, and that is something that counted well in favor of the movie. But I am getting ahead of myself here.First of all, ""The Mortuary Collection"" is a horror anthology, which the movie's title sort of also indicates. But just so you know, this is indeed a horror anthology, for better or worse.The different short stories in the anthology were of various degrees of entertainment and contents, not surprisingly really, as it usually goes with horror anthologies. Some of the stories were very good and interesting, where as some were just bland if not actually unappealing.I was initially lured in to watch this 2019 anthology because of the movie's cover. Sure, I hadn't even heard about the anthology before now in 2021 as I was given the chance to watch it. Of course I did so, because I enjoy horror and because I was intrigued by the movie's cover/poster. And when I saw that Clancy Brown was in it, this was a given movie to watch.Personally I liked most of the stories told in the anthology, but oddly enough, as it actually is with many anthologies in my opinion, it was the narrative that binds the various segments together that actually had the most appeal. Perhaps because it was that narrative that had Clancy Brown in it. But it was also a rather enjoyable narrative story binding the other stories together.Visually then ""The Mortuary Collection"" was rather interesting and good. I liked the special effects and the make-up. The special effects, both practical and CGI was rather good in all the segments and the narrative. And the make-up and prosthetics department really worked magic in this anthology. I particularly liked what they did in terms of putting make-up on Clancy Brown.I was genuinely entertained by ""The Mortuary Collection"", and this is an anthology that I can warmly recommend you spend some time on sitting down watching.My rating of ""The Mortuary Collection"" lands on a seven out of ten stars. It is without a doubt one of the better anthologies since the ""Creepshow"" ones.",The Mortuary Collection
2,BandSAboutMovies,Finally a good modern portmanteau!,8,12 August 2021,"As bad as most modern horror anthologies are, The Mortuary Collection makes a real case for the future of these movies, even if it borrows some of its narrative device from Tales from the Hood.Ryan Spindell made The Babysitter Murders - I mean, if you're going to take a title, take it from one that makes horror fans recognize that you get it - which is part of this story. The framing is all about Sam (Caitlin Custer) who has come to Raven's End Mortuary to ask for a job from its owner, Montgomery Dark (Clancy Brown).He takes her through the coffins inside, telling her how each of the bodies got there. The first story is simple - a thief discovers a monster - and nearly made me stop watching this, as I worried that this would follow the example of other modern portmanteau films with stories that abruptly end and have no real narrative steam.I'm happy that I stayed with this movie.In ""Unprotected,"" a college man tries to take advantage of the woke nature of his classmates. When he finally scores his next conquest, Sandra, and takes off his condom, which leads to her making him pregnant. This is a quick and simple story, yet well-structured and filled with some disquieting imagery.""Till Death"" has a husband trying to get rid of his catatonic wife with increasingly gory and unsuccessful efforts. Ironically, the movie then has Sam demand that the stories become less about simple comeuppance. Montgomery takes Sam to the mortuary subbasement and prepares to cremate a child-size coffin. Sam then tells him she's not here for a job. She's here for the dead child and has a story to tell.This is where ""The Babysitter Murders"" fits into the story, revealing that Sam is a killer of children. She attempts to use the bones of the kids to kill the mortician, but her victims tear her apart. He sews her together and uses embalming fluid as her blood, making her the new owner of the funeral home as he steps into the sun and turns into dust.With films like this and Ghost Stories, the future of this subgenre of horror feels like it has a chance.",The Mortuary Collection
3,Hey_Sweden,"The bad guys do NOT ""always"" win in real life.",8,7 October 2021,"Writer / co-producer / director Ryan Spindell does his bit at keeping the time-honored sub genre of the horror anthology alive with ""The Mortuary Collection"". In a number of ways, it's standard fare, with an obvious setting in which to spin increasingly macabre tales. The mortician relating these tales to us is Montgomery Dark (the great Clancy Brown of such movies as ""Highlander"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Starship Troopers""). The character who gets the ball rolling is Sam (Caitlin Custer), a young woman who's come to the mortuary to apply for a job, but is first really interested in hearing some great horror stories.The first is obviously a warm-up, no more and no less. The characters even refer to it that way. A young thief goes into a restroom to examine her prizes, and makes the classic ""curiosity killed the cat"" mistake of peering behind a medicine cabinet.The next tells us about Jake (Jacob Elordi), a handsome frat boy who knows that he can pretty much have his way with women. However, he's the kind of guy who doesn't practice what he preaches, and when he has a night of wild sex with a stranger, and refuses to wear a condom, he pays a big price. The overall feel to this yarn is pretty familiar, but it's still good fun, and it's entertaining the way that Spindell never hesitates to go for the gross-out.Our third little epic concerns Wendell (Barak Hardley), a husband / caregiver living an unenviable existence caring for his sickly wife. Things keep going from bad to worse as he decides to give her some high-risk pills, and darkly comic twists are in store for this hapless fellow.Finally, Sam gets to tell her own story as she tells Dark about a child whom she'd been babysitting. While most people may find Spindells' twists rather predictable, here at least this viewer had a good chuckle as he realized how well the filmmaker had been manipulating him into thinking a certain way.The gore and creature effects by Amalgamated Dynamics, the widescreen photography, the visuals, and the songs & score by Mondo Boys were all assets in this macabre entertainment that may not really achieve the greatness of a ""Dead of Night"" or ""Creepshow"", but shows its audience a pretty good time. The devilishly fun performance by Brown is a true high point.Eight out of 10.",The Mortuary Collection
4,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Incredibly fun throwback anthology,9,4 September 2020,"Asking to become his assistant, a woman attending a funeral stays behind to inquire about the position, leading to a recollection of several stories about various victims from several previous decades until she notices something sinister behind the series of gruesome stories.The Good Stor(ies): 1950s-At a big mansion party, a thief enters a nearby bathroom to count her score when she notices something isn't right with what lies behind a sealed medicine cabinet. This was a solid and enjoyable opening to get things started. The twist about who she is and what she's doing is quite well-handled, while the battle with the creature when it's revealed is a lot of fun with some nice gore and practical effects. The length could be a detriment or positive as well, barely lasting long-enough to realize what's going on which is a good thing with the zippy pace working for it or a downfall as it doesn't have time to dwell on anything.1960s-Attending a special frat party, a chauvinist picks up a special student and takes her home, unaware of the deadly secret she's hiding within her. Despite several flaws, this is pretty fun and is quite enjoyable. The series of body-horror revelations that come after the fateful encounter is where this one works as the series of physical changes creates a rather fun counter to what had been going on previously. It's just entirely predictable and obvious what's going on and takes way too long to get there, being far too long to get to the expected punchline which may or may not be completely detrimental.1980s-Staying with her charge for the night, a babysitter becomes aware that an escaped mental patient has arrived at the house and forces her to fight him off to save her. Generally, this one had quite a lot to like. The majority of the effort being a fun stalk-and-slasher against a raging thunderstorm means that plenty of atmospheric chasing occurs throughout here which goes nicely alongside the constant torture inflicted on both participants featuring plenty of nice gore. With the tables turned nicely as the final-girl becomes more heartless and ruthless against the killer as it goes on, it's quite fun if somewhat too artistic for its good at times but not nearly enough to hold this back too much.Wrap-Around-Attempting to take up a job, a woman hears stories told by a sinister mortician about past residents only to find a far more dangerous purpose to her visit. Overall, this one is a lot of fun and has a lot to like although it does have some issues. The beginning stages are atmospheric, tense and cheesy where it's focused more on the strange tales being told. The longer it goes on, though, it just becomes ludicrous and overblown which is rather obvious that it's going on way too long with too many false endings to get the point across. The fantasy-laden CGI is out-of-place and distracting as well, making for a slightly flawed effort overall.The Bad Stor(ies): 1970s-Marrying the girl of his dreams, a man soon finds the misfortune that befalls them too much to bear until the point comes that drastic actions have to be taken for the both of them. Overall, this one seems the least likely to be included as it doesn't fit into the overall story here with the events taking on way too far-fetched and over-the-top for a simple premise that comes off quite unnaturally. Nothing is explained and the entire morality conflict that this drives towards is spelled out from the beginning. The effects are effective and the outcome is still fun but the flaws do outweigh this one.Rated Unrated/R; Graphic Violence and Language.",The Mortuary Collection
5,deloudelouvain,Not bad at all for short stories.,7,4 March 2021,"I wasn't expecting too much from this movie as I normally find short stories a bit disappointing. Sometimes you just don't get enough from a short story, but in this case I have to admit they were all well made and interesting to follow. The acting was good and that from all the actors in the different stories. The special effects and the make-up for the creeps and monsters, it was all done very professionally and they deserve credits for that. The Mortuary Collection is perfect for amateurs of Tales From The Crypt but it will also please people that just like a good horror tale with decent special effects.",The Mortuary Collection
6,thesar-2,Beware The Average-Sized Man,8,23 October 2020,"Man, do I love a good anthology. Namely a Horror Anthology. Wait. Do they really make any other kinds?I like them so much, usually I'm very biased with them and judge the bad ones more harshly than I probably should. Mercifully, The Mortuary Collection is one of the better ones. Also, one with probably the longest wraparound ever.But, no complaints, each story, including the wraparound, was wildly entertaining with great production designs, acting, sets and gore effects. I'm used these kinds of short stories within a story, so I expect certain things. And others, I'm pleasantly surprised. My guesses were NOT on fire with this one.So, an ""Alice"" in this wonderland of frights is looking for a job at the local and creepy morgue run by an even creepier mortician. Oddly, and it did take me out of the movie for a bit, the applicant requests stories of her future employer in her spontaneous interview. That is certainly NOT recommended in real life.But he complies and we're tricked and treated to some gems. It's definitely Rated-R, but not too far over the top sans a few scenes I had to look away. If you like these kinds of inventive stories within a movie, you must add this to your list.***Final thoughts: Probably the wraparound was my favorite, but I certainly liked them all. In the second story, I could swear Hollywood - no, The World - had found their next Clark Kent/Superman with the male lead, Frat-boi ""Jake"" played by 23-year-old Jacob Elordi. All I saw while watching him in practically every scene of Story Two was Superman. He'd be perfect in the evitable next reboot! (WB, you owe me if you pick him.)More final thoughts: I loved that little Asian kid! He was so adorable and really added to the story at the right time. And, speaking of which, glad to see more and more Asians represented in American horror, unlike previous decades. And the kid wasn't the only Asian.",The Mortuary Collection
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,You're tellin' all me stories!,6,7 September 2021,"'The Mortuary Collection (2019)' is, essentially, an anthology of short horror films that each focus on a different sort of 'poetic justice'. Though, at times, it can often feel like the framing story exists only to house these disconnected experiences, it ultimately ties itself into at least one of the shorts in a satisfying and unexpected way. The thing is often a little clunky, don't get me wrong, but it tells a complete narrative when viewed as a whole. The four shorts generally improve as the piece progresses, with the first being the simplest (and, by extension, worst) and the last being the most ambitious. The final short is far and away the best thing about the entire affair, so it's a bit of a shame that I can't give this film full credit for it. That's because it is comprised entirely, I believe, of one of director Ryan Spindell's previous outings. Still, it's undeniable that the story is suspenseful, subversive and surprising; its twist is genuinely unexpected and proves that the filmmakers are keenly aware of audience expectation. It also ties into the framing narrative very closely, making the final third of the movie its most cohesive and successful. Although the actual ending may be a little silly, it's generally entertaining in a pulpy sort of way and unveils yet another layer to the overall experience. For a while, the flick is a bit too slow-moving for its own good. It also seems to lack a distinct drive for quite some time. The first two short stories aren't all that great, to be honest. I mean, they're fine for what they are but they don't exactly inspire the imagination. The third is much better and, as I've mentioned, the fourth is straight-up fantastic (though not technically created for this). The whole thing has an almost tongue-in-cheek vibe, too, which helps smooth over its rough edges. Even though it gets properly dark and features some fairly full-on gore, it's generally fun horror as opposed to terrifying horror. That's okay, though; not every horror film has to scare you to the bone. In the end, this is an uneven yet enjoyable anthology that knows what it is and seems to relish it. 6/10.",The Mortuary Collection
8,westsideschl,Better Than Expected,8,15 August 2021,"Storyline: A mortician tells a series of tales to a potential apprentice.

10,paulclaassen,The new generation Creepshow.,6,3 July 2021,"'The Mortuary Collection' is the new generation 'Tales from the Crypt', or 'Creepshow', or the more recent 'Scary stories to tell in the dark'.The film is beautifully shot, making every scene almost look like a masterpiece. The first story is a short one - like a teaser - and is about a thief who gets more than she bargained for. Not fascinating, but interesting enough as a starter.The second story is about a guy who refused to use a condom, and tricked a girl into making her believe he did in fact use a condom. Things go very wrong for him, though, when HE gets pregnant. This segment was rather good and had a bit more flesh to the bone.The third story is about a guy caring for his terminally ill wife, but decided on a 'mercy killing' to save her from her suffering. However, things doesn't quite go according to plan. This was by far the best segment with good performances and incredible visuals. Rather creepy too.The last story is about a babysitter, who encounters an intruder and must fight to survive the night.If you're a fan of the aforementioned films, you will love 'The Mortuary Collection' - if this is your sort of thing, off course. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",The Mortuary Collection
11,Tweetienator,Horror Served Well,7,17 October 2020,"I agree with those rather negative reviews that The Mortuary Collection is nothing special or unique - but, and this is a great but, everything we get served is well produced and good looking (nice settings, costume designs etc.). The actors (Clancy Brown and Caitlin Custer!) do very well, and some fine gory special effects spice things up. The twist in the end is also a nice one.

13,kevin_robbins,"this is a very worthwhile addition to the genre and worth a viewing, it's just not as good as some of the classics in this genre (Creepshow, Tales from the Darkside, Tales fro",7,2 May 2021,"The Mortuary Collection (2019) is a series of short horror stories told by a mortician during an interview of woman who enters the mortuary as a response to a help wanted sign. Little does she know her responses and reactions to the stories is all part of the job interview process. This movie is directed by Ryan Spindell in his major motion picture debut. This picture stars Clancy Brown (Shawshank Redemption), Caitlin Custer (Teen Wolf), Christine Kilmer (Shameless), Mike Nelson (Black-ish), Ema Horvath (What Lies Below) and Jacob Elordi (Euphoria). The storyline for this is just okay...I can't say I loved the mortuary scenes; however, the actual short stories themselves were excellent. My two favorites was probably the pregnant man storyline and the story about the man dealing with his wife being non-cognitive. The special effects and kill scenes are outstanding and the stories are well told and paced. Overall this is a very worthwhile addition to the genre and worth a viewing, it's just not as good as some of the classics in this genre (Creepshow, Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt, etc).

17,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Modern Horror Anthology,9,23 December 2020,"For this movie, I heard about it around Halloween and it was one that I was intrigued to check out. I knew this movie was an anthology, which when done right I'm usually a fan of. I also got the chance to hear an interview of the writer/director Ryan Spindell on a podcast. Hearing how passionate he was for this project, it really made me want to see it as well. Most everyone was pretty high on this as well which boded well for me. The synopsis here is an eccentric mortician recounts several macabre and phantasmagorical tales that he's encountered in his distinguished career.We start this off following a paperboy as he makes his way through Raven's End. His name is Bill (Tristan Byon) and we get a taste of the town as he rides through. His journey takes him to the Raven's End Mortuary that is located in the woods. There are a bunch of papers so Bill decides to go up to the door. He gets scared off by the mortician who runs the place, Montgomery Dark (Clancy Brown). Bill drops his camera and Montgomery keeps it when he leaves.He then presides over a funeral for a child and there's something that he says that throws off those in attendance to the point where many of them cannot look at him as they leave. He thinks that everyone is gone when he discovers Sam (Caitlin Custer) in the showing room. Montgomery asks if she is there showing her respects, but she reveals she is answering the ad for a job. He takes her into the office and she inquires about all of the books. This causes Montgomery to tell her that they all contain the stories of how and why all those that comes through the doors end up there. Sam wants him to tell her a story, which he is reluctant to do, but gives in.This is where the movie starts to break into the 4 stories of this anthology with the wraparound Montgomery showing her around. The first tale is Emma (Christine Kilmer) going into the bathroom. There's a knock at the door and she tells the guy that she's meet up with him in 10 minutes. She notices a weird slime on the light switch. We see that she's someone who is up to no good and there's something quite odd in this bathroom with her.The story after this involves a fraternity where Jake (Jacob Elordi) has quite a lot of success with the ladies. Things all change when he meets Sandra (Ema Horvath). They go to hook up and she wants him to wear a condom. When he doesn't, he gets a horrible surprise as the tables are turned.Then we go to a story of a newly married couple of Carol (Sarah Hay) and Wendell (Barak Hardley). Things went south pretty fast. Carol is in a comatose state and Wendell is struggling to not only take care of her, but to also pay all the bills for her treatments. That is until Dr. Harold Kubler (Mike C. Nelson) offers an alternative.For the final story, Sam takes the reins as it turns out she did know the little boy's who funeral just happened. She tells the tale of what happened the night he passed away and the riot that was on a newspaper headline at the local mental hospital as well. Things aren't necessarily as we seem there as Montgomery is impressed with her story telling ability.Now that's where I'm going to leave my recap of the movie as that gets you up to speed with everything with it. I will say I really liked what this movie was doing here. For me, I prefer to have my anthology films to have a wraparound and this one feels lot like Tales from the Hood. What I mean there as that we're in a mortuary, the tales are mostly being told by our mortician and then the final tale involves our character much like that one did. That is really not a bad thing at all. I'm a fan of Tales from the Hood so taking a page out of that book while doing something works for me. We also are learning the tales of people that have come to this mortuary for their final resting place.This is one in the vein of Tales or like Creepshow where all of the shorts are written by the same person and directed with one vision for them as well. In the case here, Spindell did both of them so that works well for a singular vision. These stories feel a lot like you'd get in the old EC Comics where they're cautionary tale. This movie is smart though that it has come out well after them where Sam calls out Montgomery for them. The first story is quite short compared to the others and Sam states she wants more. It is fine, but nothing special. As the others go on, I like the Meta approach where it is someone doing a bad deed and them being punished for it. It works well for the final one for sure.The last thing I'll say here is that we get a nice combination of stories. We get a bit of cosmic horror, which is a sub-genre I've been really getting into more of lately and I liked seeing it. There's also a bit of creature feature here and social commentary through flipping gender roles. I also like what they do with the couple and how wild things end up there. It also goes a bit supernatural that I can appreciate. The final story and how it ties in with the wraparound really just completed the movie for me. What I haven't said is that I believe this movie takes place in the 1950's or the early 60's. It still has a timeless feel as they don't shove it down your throat.Where I want to go next would be the acting. I love that Brown is taking on Montgomery here and being our story teller. He has such a great screen presence and how he plays this role is perfect. This is a character I wouldn't be mad to see again and have another movie with him. Custer was really good as well. Her character change by the end worked for me. She also calls out Montgomery and she brings some sass to the role. She pulls out the Meta aspects on top of it. Aside from this, I think that the rest of the acting is well done. Being that it is shorts, the writing helps to establish the characters and their performances convey what they need in the short time given for me.The last thing that I really want to go over would be effects. The practical ones that we get look good. There isn't a lot of gore, but we do get a fair amount of blood. There are also some creature effects that are done here as well. What doesn't necessarily hold up for me is the CGI. There is some green screen that I noticed and didn't look great. There is a bit I think used here and there throughout the movie. This didn't look as bad, but I'm still not fan when I noticed it.So now with that said this movie was really a pleasant surprise. Something I led off saying was that when anthologies are done right, I'm on board. I liked the 4 stories that we got and how the wraparound factored in there in the end. The acting really helps to bring it to life. The practical effects were good and the CGI doesn't necessarily work for me. It doesn't necessarily ruin it though either. I would also say that the sound design and soundtrack worked as well. We get a nice mix here and I thought this movie was a really good movie that is bordering again on being great.

21,gedikreverdi,A visually appealing and spooky horror anthology with a twist at the end,7,26 July 2021,"It was visually beautiful and reminded of Guillermo del Toro films. The twist at the end was pretty good but it could have been just a bit shorter than this. There're 4 stories one of which belonged to the fairy tooth serial killer in disguise of someone wanting to work at the mortuary. Montgomery Dark the mortician told 3 stories. The first one was short and fun. A thief woman got sucked into the medicine cabinet by an octopus-like monster. The second is about a man who used to be fat and now he's having unprotected sex. He had sex with that mysterious woman too and ended up being pregnant to a monster. He labored at the house of the woman with the help of his parents and died. The grandmother of the monster baby put it in a room full of numerous cradles. The third and the last story from the mortician was the best. It was about a man taking care of his catatonic wife. One day after seeing how desperate he is, the doctor gave him untraceable painkillers. He gave them to his wife and chopped her up to fit her dead body into her bridal chest. He's afraid of the elevators and he got stuck in the elevator with the chest. They went down and down at free-fall and his alien looking wife got out of the chest and when the police opened the elevator, he was sitting with a photo album in his hands. There was a funeral of a little boy on the same day. And the fairy tooth killer told her story how she got into his house as a babysitter and cooked him at the oven and killed the psychopath on the loose. The boy's father was the doctor from the other stories. Then she stabbed the mortician too but he was undead. She couldn't leave the house and was eaten alive by the charred dead little kids coming out of the books containing her stories. Then he put her back together and got out and disappeared.

22,thekarmicnomad,Typical horror anthology - takes its time,7,18 October 2020,"This is a horror anthology movie.
Those not familiar with the term: this is a selection of short horror stories tied together by their telling. Perhaps by cowboys around a camp fire or standard travelers taking refuge from the rain in a spooky old house.
The stories tend to be along the lines of: a creepy old man finds a sweet, young girl in the forest searching for her lost puppy. He offers to help her look, with obvious ulterior motives, then when the puppy is found it turns out to be a werewolf and the girl giggles as the man is devoured.So this format is well worn and tends to be a bit lame: so much that the Simpsons even spoof it.So if you accept what this is and its limitation then you should find that this is an excellent example of its kind.It is quite slow in pace and is happy to take its time showing you around the funeral home that is the tie-together story.
Now, we know that our expectations are soon to be subverted, but the film knows that, and it knows that we know that.
So it is not afraid to do the odd double or even triple fake-out.The setting is immaculately laid out with great sets, lighting and effects.
The main characters are interesting and well cast.
It is obvious a lot of care and love has been poured into this and it really shows.Now this is not particularly scary and the stories are quite pedestrian, but this is part of the course.
I found this to be an atmospheric, fun bit of horror that is unlikely to give anyone nightmares.",The Mortuary Collection

Where Montgomery Dark(Clancy Brown) an Mortician finishes his funeral service and is then approach by a young lady name Sam(Caitlin Custer) who what's to work as his apprentice. While he shows her around recounts four twisted tales. While nothing to mind blowing or outstanding, this film is a fun that full of camp and charm. The 2nd and 3rd are the most interesting, with the most time put into them. The 1st helps ease you into the film, but, nothing more. The 4th pretty much serves to wrap up everything though is does have a good twist. Also each story is theme around a specific decades. The acting is done well Clancy brown is great his presents and his voice is chilling, the make up on is done well good. His looks is very similar to the Tall man from The Phantasm series. It honestly wouldn't be surprising if that was intentional. Cailtian Custer is also good you don't know why she's what's to work other then she thinks its cool, but it clearly she has no Qualms with her morbid sense of humor. The rest of the are just basic characters. The music good and the production of the the house itself is appealing.

I have rarely been so delighted to be wrong.I've always liked Clancy Brown, and he plays the mortician character, Montgomery Dsrk, with an affable, quirky aplomb. Caitlin Custer absolutely nails it with her performance as a young woman who has supposedly come to apply for a job opening for mortuary assistant.If you enjoyed the old HBO ""Tales from the Crypt"" series... which I did... you will very likely enjoy ""The Mortuary Collection"".

39,kyleallencole9,Excellent Horror Anthology,7,13 April 2021,"Wow this one was a wicked ride!Starts out with a mortician played by Clancy Brown who is showing a young teenager the ropes around a spooky mortuary. Each body has it's own story in this one.The first story centers on a thieving woman who comes across a creature at a party.The second story is about a womanizing fraternity brother who finds himself changed after a one night stand with a college student. This one was a pretty morbid and nasty tale about body horror.The third story was decent and about a lonely man who spends his days taking care of his comatose wife where with a doctors help, he gives her some pills to make her go to sleep forever. The pills have a different effect on her, resulting in her tragic accidental death. Her husband decides to dismember her body and get rid of the evidence. He is unaware that the pills have made her a vengeful spirit and learns the hard way how sacred marriage is.After these three stories are told, we are introduced to a little childs body in a coffin, who is about to be cremated, the girl tells the mortician that this boy belongs to her story and she wants to tell it.Her story is called The Babysitter murders about a masked killer years before who killed teen babysitters.She is alone with a child in a spooky home babysitting, when she hears there was a riot at a nearby asylum and some inmates may have escaped including a cannibalistic child murderer.This story had a rather surprising and gruesome twist in it while showing the silhouette of a child who was been killed and cooked in a oven.Once this story comes to an end, she discovers the mortician and her fate there has been sealed.Definitely a nice and twisted slice of horror. Highly recommend!!",The Mortuary Collection

But Ryan Spindell pulls it off with his full-feature debut which he built off the foundation of his excellent 2015 short ""The Babysitter Murders."" That short is incorporated deftly into the feature film with an excellent ""wrap-around"" story to tie it all together.Fun fact: John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" was originally ""The Babysitter Murders"" and the homage is obvious and delightful.",The Mortuary Collection

43,nebk,No Evil Deed Goes Unpunished,7,15 October 2020,"Starting off with a girl asking for a job in an old funeral home The Mortuary Collection is a horror anthology consisting of 5 loosly connected stories told by the mortuary owner to his potential new assistant. One is about a thief getting eaten by a monster at a house party, another is about a womanizing playboy getting the tables turned on him when he gets impregnated by a girl because he refused to use protection. The third is about a man who decides to end his ill wife's suffering (and his own) by poisoning her but everything that can go wrong does so and in a spectacular manner. The fourth story is a serial killer/babysitter trope turned on its head and the final story takes place throughout the film and is about the mortuary owner and the assistant who isn't at all what she seems.In short this is a very good blend of horror and humor with very competent acting all around especially by Clancy Brown who really does well as the creepy mortuary owner Mortimer Dark. The rest of the cast is not that well known but do a great job.The stories are written and directed well and the effects are competent for the most part other then a few glaring cgi moments which couldn't be avoided. This is highly recommended for horror fans and just in time for Halloween.",The Mortuary Collection
44,el7,What it lacks in surprises it makes up for in charm.,8,30 June 2021,"The Mortuary Collection is a very well-produced anthology built around a frame narrative in which a creepy old mortician hires a young woman as his assistant and then proceeds, at her prodding, to tell her stories about the eery town of Raven's End in which the old Victorian mortuary is located. Each story builds on the creepiness factor, with a through line of Dr. Kubler as a character who becomes involved somehow (even if only to be referenced). The aesthetic is meant to evoke several different time periods at once, both in fashion and in a soundtrack courtesy of the Mondo Boys, lending a nostalgic feel to the whole thing without ever feeling like a period piece. Although most of the stories in the anthology lean into common tropes, they do so with panache; and there are a couple of surprises in store at the end and they're pretty good ones. It would be neat to see a continuation of this as a series, though it works well as a standalone piece. Definitely worth a spot in your Halloween marathon.",The Mortuary Collection

48,BeanieCore,"By a horror fanatic, for horror fanatics.",8,3 February 2021,"Director and writer Ryan Spindell is obviously a huge horror fanatic. His debut feature film is a twisted love letter to the genre, combining elements from various decades of horror into one big, fun, surprisingly intelligent celebration of fear. The film harkens back to ""Tales From The Crypt"", with a dash of influence from the old Amicus anthology films, combining gross out humor and gore with classic morality plays. Most anthology films feature at least one disappointing segment, but this is the rare film of it's kind in which each story is as good as the last. All 3 tales are clever, blackly humorous and well directed by Spindell. The entire film a sheen of dark, yet colorful cinematography, and the set designs shift back and forth, between believable recreations of different time periods.Best of all, right when you expect the ending to fall back on clichés, it delivers a final twist that will leave retro horror fans feeling giddy. The abundance of practical effects is more than welcome, and are of excellent quality for a lower-budget film. And the wrap-around is equally engaging as the stories themselves, thanks in large part to Clancy Brown's excellent performance as the mortician. Acting is good across the board, in most of the segments as well. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's been some time since we've had an anthology film of this quality, or with this much love placed into it's making. If you're a bona-fide horror fan, you can't afford to miss it.",The Mortuary Collection

56,Blazehgehg,Right on the edge of too much,8,21 October 2020,"This anthology has a smirking wit to it that constantly teeters on the razor's edge between being cool and annoying.A young woman inquires about a job at a mortuary, and the mortician is skeptical about her ability. She challenges him to tell her increasingly scary stories about some of the weirdest cases he's ever taken. Some are shocking, or gross, or horrifying (sometimes, all three at once). No matter the tale, there's always an edge of dark humor throughout, and the woman has her own sly commentary on story and storyteller alike.Even though The Mortuary Collection threatens to be a little too smart (and snarky) for its own good, it's hard not to be charmed by something in this collection of stories. It may not reach the same highs as films like ""Creepshow"" or even ""Trick 'r' Treat"", but Clancy Brown is perfect as the gravely-voiced mortician, telling stories that are always scary, but never frightening, if that makes any sense.It's the sort of movie where, in 15 or 20 years, there's going to be a whole generation of adults that remembers seeing this when they were teenagers, and for them, it'll be their number one cult classic.For me, it was the sort of movie where every time it felt like I was about to roll my eyes, it managed to stick the landing.

I mean c'mon how many set-ups can you use for an anthology horror movie before you need to rehash older themes. How many times has the funeral director/ crypt-keeper/ grave-digger/ pathologist/ mad-scientist ect. telling horror stories thing been done? Countless, right?But, one thing those others didn't necessarily have was.... Clancy Brown, if the name doesn't ring a bell think of the hardest screw in Shawshank. Yeah, that Clancy Brown. And he is fantastic as a very low-key yet perfectly gnarly old funeral director.So, does having one of the arguably finest character actors of our time (maybe even all time) save this movie from the horror movie scrap-heap? No it does not. In fact, it didn't need saving, yeah Clancy Brown is as always great in this but, he's just the cherry on top of this pretty damn good little collection of horror stories. Admittedly there's nothing particularly new here but.... So flipping what!! Its a fun horror movie. There's some twists, jumps, laughs and more than enough blood and gore to satisfy even the more jaded horror fans out there.Looking for new blood to add to this years creepy crawly movie binge?

That is not necessarily a problem but the segment bring nothing new to the table and that makes them very predictable and unmemorable. The fourth segment was the only one that could peak my interest.
The film has the same problems as scary stories to tell in the dark. Well made but with little substance.
I didn't think it would have been a masterpiece but I hoped for a fun little movie to spend my evening with.

76,SJinSeaTac,Bad,1,16 October 2020,"This movie was not scary, nor clever, and a waste of time. To me, many of these reviews are probably planted by the creators of this movie and possibly Shudder as well. If you want to be incredibly bored for about two hours, go ahead and watch. Otherwise, watch something else on Netflix. Maybe watch it again.",The Mortuary Collection

78,kstice-25195,A horror anthology consistent with Shudder quality,6,25 October 2020,"Shudder continues to be one of the best sources for horror fans looking for quality, independent horror films. Some of their titles, such as Tigers Are Not Afraid, are sure-to-be classics. The majority of their movies, including The Mortuary Collection, are quality movies with a few faults. The Mortuary Collection will entertain the audience, even if the ending is a bit confusing and weak in spots. The anthology consists of the connecting story, one short intro story, and three primary tales. The first full-length about male pregnancy is the best, with the most novel idea of the movie. The second tale, about marriage, is the most emotional and dramatic. Finally, the third tale and the connecting story have their strengths. Unfortunately, the main twist of the story ultimately falls flat. I won't go into the details, but there are way too many plot holes. Luckily, Shudder movies are primarily about fun, and The Mortuary Collection is will bring you nearly two hours of fun.Pros: All stories are interesting and well-made, great setting, strong acting for a horror movie.Cons: Weak twist, not as scary as the best horror anthologies",The Mortuary Collection

What I expect was what I got and honestly, it was good. A few things I didn't expect but overall it was an entertaining Halloween vibe kind movie for adults. It really gave me the feeling of A House with a Clock in it's Walls for some reason, maybe because it was so bold with it's setting, but I liked that.

Like the Creepshow films and TV series it was spot on for laughs and tongue-in-cheek gory horror. A special mention for Clancy Brown who played his part to perfection in a roll that could easily have been over-the-top. These type of portmanteau films that combine multiple shorter stories within an overall framework used to be so popular, but have become rare, but the multiple stories mean there's something for everyone, and if you don't like the story you're watching there'll always be another along in a minute or two.

83,iceman-johnson,really ?,3,4 January 2021,"I got told ""its lemony snicket for adults ""..lemony snicket is more for adults than this.
i paid 99p for a 3 month subscription to shudder only because i wanted to watch ""anything for jackson"" which was pretty good when i finished that i browsed shudders section for another low budget film and this seemed highly recommended by people in the amazon reviews (idiots)the good things about it :
the mortician was played by that guy from pet sematary 2 (that was a way better film than this and that was pants ) who was a great choice because he looks eerie and has dead eyes but that's as far as it goes tbh.the set designs and effects were done pretty well pretty sure there was a huge nod to the goonies at the start with the locationthe badddd
it felt like i was was watching an episode of ""are you afraid of the dark"" with added gore. the thing is are you afraid of the dark knew its audience this doesn't. . this was clearly aimed at young teens but for some reason is being punted to adults . no self respecting ""adult"" would sit through all this and find it entertaining or scary. i only watched it all the way through because i paid the subscription fee and i wanted my money's worth. it should have been punted as a horror comedy and beefed up the cheese a little more and it might have worked better. but it really looked like they tried to be serious in parts and it was far from that thatthe little stories in the film were boring and obvious. the one that made me laugh was guy getting pregnant after a one night stand even then it was forced because of how stupid it was. after that it was your typical lets make it gory lets make it super dark and grimy , thats scary right ? ..the guy with the trapped inside wife ..what the hell was that about ???? stupid plastic alien face and over use of fake blood ruined itthe ending...... the smug girl who went to the funeral home for a job and has been nothing but a complete cringe fest turns out to be .you ready for it ???.....""the boggy bay tooth fairy ""...(that hurt writing that ) a girl who kills kids for their teeth?? and she went to the funeral home to go retrieve her victims tooth as a trophy not to get a job .....such shyamalan twist...good griefi gave it a 3 star because although i hated it and i've seen scarier episodes of goosebumps and i made fun out of it all the way through i do feel a good effort was made by the people that made it . it was visually very good looking and the sets looked awesome. such a let down from the main character. she just came across as irritating and smug and cringy and her story was just stupid with such an obvious twist. the mortician nailed it and did a great job though, creepy and strange but not over the top. the movie came off very childish though overall and it wouldn't faze the average 12 yr old tbh . they should have dropped the storytelling and intertwined the stories with them all ending up being connected somehow but it just felt lazy and something my 16 yr old would laugh at",The Mortuary Collection

But this was a really good horror movie and I like horror movies that carry different stories in it.Although some of the plots and actors may feel B-movie like, it was entertaining just the same. It could have added a bit more substance to it though since some parts were too common. Gore-wise it was sufficient and the movie itself wasn't exactly a waste of time.Maybe that's why it didn't create much of an impact to the horror world.",The Mortuary Collection

Teens - Will probably have fun with this one!
Kids - Would be fascinated, only it's not recommended due to all of the gore!
(Perhaps a PG-13 version or a TV version that's censored would suffice)Yes, I would recommend this movie!This is one of those campy horror movie flicks that you should give a watch, only if you've got nothing else to watch! Honestly have some mixed feelings about the film. As I've always been a fan of Clancy Brown. An always have had an attachment to Horror Anthology's ever since I was a kid. This does however feel a bit like a tamer version of the Creepshow tv series. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing! As I'm somewhat biased here, because I'm very partial to traditional 80's and 90's horror films / tv shows / anthology's that utilized practical effects over cgi.

This is scary fairytale done so beautifully with a lot of imagination. Thanks to that you will not forget for a while that this is just unreal fun.

This one walked the comic edge with some dark humor, but it was still entertaining as plain, old-fashioned horror. Not as goofy or campy as I expected. And I adore Clancey Brown, so that was a big draw. Really cohesive as an anthology, which is rare. All four stories were equally good, though each was entirely unique. Seemingly disparate stories, all tied up in a nice little twist ending bow. It's not particularly scary, but it does have some creatively creepy moments. And some pretty cool effects (I'm not a big gore hound, but yes - there is enough cringeworthy material for those of you who are). Set and atmosphere are top-notch. And Clancey Brown is the delightfully creepy cherry atop the anthology cake!",The Mortuary Collection

Most of it seem to go for a strange/shock factor over a creepy/scary factor.

105,jondav2006,Absolute rubbish,1,25 February 2021,"I cannot believe that this trash passes off as horror these days. First off, the tone of the movie is clearly aimed at juvenile viewers - the halloweeen crowd; who pretend to be scared of ""creepy"" stories and think that's fun (I'm not a prude either but to me the idea of fun in horror is closer to evil dead than trick or treat nonsense). The second issue are the anthologies themselves; none seem to be definitively connected to the main character (mortician) or to each other. The last story is the absolute worst of the lot - the director goes all in with the standard horror tropes! The twists, which is supposedly fun according to our usual halloween crowd, just make the story lamer and lamer. By the end, I was furious of having wasted 1.5 hours of my life on this pile of junk which I'll never get back.A quick word on the ratings. It's mind-boggling to see this film enjoy a 6.5 rating as of this writing, while more decent efforts (e.g. Bryan Bertino's The Dark And The Wicked) get rated lower.

109,jtnite,Outstanding throwback anthology.,9,22 October 2020,"This movie walks the fine line of simultaneously paying homage to old horror, critiquing old horror, and simply making a great anthology that doesn't belabor the first two points.First things first: This thing looks amazing. There's a 50s-ish vibe to the sets, costuming and makeup, but it's heightened - think Pushing Daisies, Pleasantville or Big Fish. The visual effects are top notch - obviously there was a limited budget here, but that means lovely, squishy, visceral practical effects for the most part, with just a smidge of CGI.We also get a larger variety of stories than you usually do in an anthology. The first one is a darkly comic little gut punch, shorter than the other segments. Then we get some social commentary (and some fantastically gory scenes), then a bleakly comic but oddly touching story of marriage, loss and murder. Then we cap it off with The Babysitter Murders, which Spindell released as a standalone short a few years back, but which he has folded effortlessly into this in a profoundly satisfying way.All of it is held together by Clancy Brown at his Clancy Browniest, all subtle snark and basso profundo. He's telling these stories to Caitlin Custer as the mysterious ingenue, and her character could have been insufferable -- she provides a little meta-commentary and critique of each story after it's been told. Fortunately it's just wink-nod enough, not too much to spoil it.Overall, this is a blast. I loved every minute of it.

I think it's because they all follow the development order of the whole content.After reading it, we can guess that the old man in the house must have been a sinful person before he came here, but he followed his own idea of doing evil, that is, the balance of all things and karma. But when the old man was in the hut, there was still a job advertisement at the door. I think there are two reasons: 1. The old man wants to leave the hut, and he thinks he can leave if he recruits a new person to replace him, and he doesn't know the consequences of leaving, which can be seen from his last behavior and expression. 2. The old man is not the real owner of the hut. The hut is just like a spiritual treasure looking for a suitable owner. This can be seen from the advertisement falling off after the abnormal woman became the owner of the hut. It no longer needs to look for it.So the question is, what kind of owner does the hut want? That's the abnormal female leader's way. The principle she pursues is that ""the bad guys always win."".

Not only that, despite copying the film, the entire meaning and purpose behind the original's creation was completely erased. We were presented with a film that highlights the plight of Black American's with a horrific twist. Instead, The Mortuary Collection turns it into a campy horror flick which is a slap in the face.
