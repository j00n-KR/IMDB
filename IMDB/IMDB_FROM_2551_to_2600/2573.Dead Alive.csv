0,MartinHafer,neat idea but way too much emphasis on special effects,3,23 December 2005,"I've got to first admit that this is not the type film I usually watch and I tend to hate movies that rely so heavily on special effects. So, keep this in mind when reading the review. I actually watched it because it was billed as a comedy and it sounded weird and irreverent--just the type of movie I like to watch from time to time. The problem for me was that although it had a cute idea of mom becoming some sort of ""straight from the pit of hell"" monster after she was bitten by a rabid monkey, the movie just degenerated into the most amazingly grotesque display of special effects I have ever seen (with the possible exception of THE EVIL DEAD). Guts, blood and gore abound, so I would be hesitant to let Junior watch this flick (unless you ARE trying to raise your child to be a maniac). Now that I think about it, I would be hesitant to let ME watch it again as well!",Dead Alive
1,Leofwine_draca,A Peter Jackson triumph with an unforgettable climax,10,13 December 2015,"Peter Jackson's huge cult success has gone down in history as the ""goriest film ever made"". With five gallons of blood being pumped a second for the splatterific climax, this film does what SHAUN OF THE DEAD did years and years later: it made zombies funny. Shot on a low budget, probably about a millionth of what he had available to him when he made LORD OF THE RINGS, Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD is a huge cult success that stands repeat viewing just thanks to the sheer humour and originality of the production. Intricate attention to detail has always been one of the director's best aspects and it's just as present here as it was when he became a multi-million pound director all those years later. But in many ways, BRAINDEAD's quirkiness makes it stand out as still one of the best of the director's career, coming just after his Middle Earth trilogy for me.The first hour of the film is an inventive, low budget laugh riot. It mixes together a sweet boy-meets-girl romance with zombies, and the result is clearly uneven but even so it works. The Kiwi angle breathes fresh life into the genre and Jackson explores the zombie mythos in many original ways; forget mundane flesh-munching, these zombies have feelings, have sex, have much more fun than a typical brain-dead gut-muncher you'll find in an Italian gore flick. The acting is over the top throughout, adding to the film's deranged turn. Timothy Balme deserves huge kudos for his character's convincing transformation from lovable geek to macho hero, and Diana Penalver is equally good as his feisty Spanish girlfriend. Yet the cast is also fleshed out with other great turns from the Australian and Kiwi supporting cast. Elizabeth Moody's domineering mother is the obvious stand-out, but for my money the flesh-creeping Ian Watkin is just as good as the slimy Uncle Les. Yet the best turn for me is the guy playing the mod-turned-zombie, who really gives the performance his all. Even though he's stuck with half a body for much of his screen time, he's a real hoot in what is a physically exhausting turn.Anyhow, the first hour is pretty good, full of gross-out comedy – the custard-eating scene is the notable bit – and bizarre cameos from a range of odd characters. It's also full of gore and prosthetic effects, from the embalming-machine-gone-wrong set-piece – try holding down your lunch when you watch that one – to the rapidly rotting mother and the stand-out fight scene in the graveyard between a kung fu priest and a horde of the undead. So far, so good, but nothing I would ever have watched again. The zombies never number more than half a dozen and the limitations of the budget are obvious; for instance, much is made of a silly zombie baby including a padded-out interlude in a children's park in which Jackson seems to be going too far to make the audience cringe with his bad taste and violence. At around the hour mark, a house party takes place which is soon besieged by the undead – and then things start getting REALLY gory! The party scene lasts until the movie's climax, which also throws in a giant monster a la KING KONG for some fun and games. It's around forty minutes of classic film-making, as our partygoers attempt to defend themselves against a growing army of the undead. It's here that Jackson's inventiveness really comes to the fore, with a series of outlandish deaths and zombie hijinks, each one crazier than the last! Lightbulbs go through heads, hands exit from mouths and internal organs are soon popping all over the place as the screen becomes awash with blood. Here's where all the money went, and it really shows; in fact, the half-an-hour full-scale zombie attack is one of my favourite moments of cinema and enough to guarantee this whole film a five-star rating. The special effects, all prosthetic, are wonderfully good and Jackson never skimps on his imagination for a second. We get flying severed heads, evil intestines and more splatter than you've ever seen in your life. Then comes the one definitive moment that put this film in the history books for good – the infamous lawnmower climax. This sees Lionel finally deciding to fight back, employing a petrol lawnmower in his fight against the ravenous zombies – with extraordinary, eye-poppingly gory results. It's all done humorously, with just the right overdone music and bulging-eyed acting, and thankfully it seems to go on forever; no blink-and-you'll-miss-it stuff going on here, it's all focused lovingly up on screen. A superb ending which makes the film and the first hour worth sitting through, I can't praise it enough. See for yourself!",Dead Alive
2,SnoopyStyle,Peter Jackson horror comedy indie,5,3 May 2015,"It's 1957 Skull Island. A group is pursued by the natives for stealing a monkey. They managed to bring the rat-monkey home to Wellington Zoo, New Zealand after one of them got bitten and having the arm chopped off. Mama's boy Lionel Cosgrove is on a date with shopkeeper's daughter Paquita María Sánchez at the zoo. His mother gets bitten by the monster turning her into a killer zombie.I'm fine with the horror indie part. Peter Jackson puts his limited resources to the best use. The problem is that the comedy isn't always funny and I found the romantic notes rather clunky. The rom-com tone is pretty annoying and I wish he keeps to the horror gore side. The gore is somewhat fun. I think the actors aren't good enough to sell the romance or the comedy or the acting. Also Lionel is not a particularly good lead character. He's pathetic, annoying and not much fun.",Dead Alive
3,Prismark10,Braindead,6,20 June 2021,"I do remember the cinema trailer for Braindead, rather amusing with the split screen.This early work for three times Oscar winner Sir Peter Jackson is more an exercise of special effects over acting and a coherent screenplay.Lionel Cosgrove is the mama's boy whose life is turned into hell when his overbearing mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey.Now the zombified mother is infecting everyone else especially when creepy Uncle Les arrives and holds a big party. It is up to Lionel and his new girlfriend Paquita that his mother disapproved off to just to stay alive.The film is a black horror comedy with bucket loads of gore and bad taste. The baby offspring of the dead nurse and priest is surely a homage to Gremlins.It is really a showcase of Jackson's early talents. Show what he can do with an ultra low budget. The downside is the acting is a bit off, a little on the amateur side.The grotesque special effects take precedent leaving the story just too demented.",Dead Alive
4,claudio_carvalho,A Masterpiece of the Trash Movies,10,8 February 2005,"In 1957, a rare rat monkey is brought from Sumatra to a zoo in New Zeland. The local Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) is a shy young man, having a complex due to the death of his father, and is completely dominated by his evil and possessive mother Vera (Elizabeth Moody). In a small shop nearby his house, Lionel meets the very superstitious attendant Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Peñalver), who believes he is the man of her life. Paquita invites Lionel to go to the zoo with her, but Vera follows them and is bitten by the weird Sumatrian monkey. The monkey's bite turns her into a zombie, and every person she bites also becomes a zombie. Lionel tries to hide the situation from Paquita, hiding his mother and the other zombies (his mother's nurse, the local priest and a grave thief) in his basement, using tranquilizer bought from a Nazi doctor to keep them calm. However, Lionel loses the control of the situation when his Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) arrives for his sister Vera's funeral and blackmails Lionel because of the corpses in the basement. Les promotes a big party in Lionel's house and all the guests become zombies. While traveling in my summer vacation, I have just seen ""Braindead"" again maybe for the tenth time. Full of black humor and awarded in the Festival of Avoriaz, ""Braindead"" is a masterpiece of the trash movies. The story is so funny that I can not stop laughing in most of its scenes, such as: the lunch party promoted by Vera for two members of her club, when the visitor enjoys the ""cream"" in the dessert; the priest fighting like Jackie Chan; Lionel with the baby in the park; the intestine chasing Lionel; Lionel with the lawnmower, ""ending the party""; the reference to the Oedipus complex in the end of the story. I believe I could mention many other hilarious scenes, but better off the viewer rent or buy this cult-movie and watch it. Unfortunately ""Braindead"" has not been released on DVD in Brazil. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Fome Animal"" (""Animal Hunger"")",Dead Alive
5,classicsoncall,"""Your mother ate my dog!""",1,24 June 2018,"Back in the very first couple of years of IMDb's existence, there were some God-awful films that made their way into the Top 250 List. This is one of the more extreme examples. The DVD cover for the movie states that it's 'the goriest fright film of all time'. Since I'm not a fan of this stuff, that statement could very well be true as I haven't seen much to judge it by. The only thing I know is that if the film makers had a goal of making the most disgusting film possible ever, they probably achieved their life's ambition here. The gross-out factor of the picture is way off the Richter scale, and gets my vote for the worst movie in history that should never have been made. Now I know there's an audience for stuff like this and to their credit, director Peter Jackson and writer Stephen Sinclair did a commendable job in creating an over the top gore-fest that looks like it was meant to be more of a horror spoof than anything else. I mean really, you've got a goofy looking Sumatran rat monkey, a kung fu priest, a werewolf/zombie effect that transforms it's victims into the walking dead, and a lawnmower scene that's not to be believed. For some reason there were repeated scenes of the film's hero (hero?) administering the old 'hypo up the nose trick' with some kind of serum developed by a Nazi doctor. When the love interest Paquita (Diana Peñalver) had her fill of all the nonsense going on, she just joined right in to deliver more buckets of blood with the rest of them. If you've got a queasy stomach there are any number of scenes that will send you to the porcelain goddess, and you better be quick about it.I was actually surprised to learn that Peter Jackson helmed this picture, but when the opening scene described the setting of Skull Island off the coast of Sumatra, it all made sense. Jackson would return to Skull Island in 2005 to take a crack at the rat monkey's cousin. Safe to say, ""King Kong"" wasn't nearly as bloody.",Dead Alive
6,gavin6942,The High Point of Peter Jackson's Horror Career,9,16 December 2008,"Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) is something of a mama's boy. When he falls in love with Paquita, things quickly go sour when his mother does not approve. Her death would seemingly simplify things, but unfortunately for the pair she was bitten by a rat monkey from Skull Island in Sumatra (maybe or maybe not the same island King Kong was from). Soon she becomes a zombie-like creature... and New Zealand will never be the same.Peter Jackson is often given credit for this film, and should be. While my favorite Jackson film is ""Bad Taste"", this was clearly the horror masterpiece in his resume (not ""The Frighteners"")... but often not given any credit is Stephen Sinclair, the writer. Sinclair is a Jackson crony, having also written ""Meet the Feebles"" and ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". Without Sinclair, Jackson wouldn't be where he is today. Don't underestimate a good script.""Dead Alive"" (or ""Braindead"") excels in almost every way. It has a good story, likable characters, humor. It also allegedly has the most blood of any film ever made. Gore fans cannot be without this in their collection -- the special effects guys really went all out in the death scenes, and the blood from the lawnmower scene -- oh my! Today, films with this much gore (""Machine Girl"") rely heavily on CGI, but ""Dead Alive"" shows the best that can be done in the business is still old-fashioned hard work.If you haven't given this one a chance, see it. Gore and splatter fans, especially. If you liked Lamberto Bava's ""Demons"", you'll love this. Bava is left in the dust. Though Jackson would not have been able to make such a film without the precedents of Bava and Herschel Gordon Lewis... so really this is just the latest in a long tradition of gore cinema. Sadly, in the sixteen years since, I don't think we've seen a rival.",Dead Alive
7,lee_eisenberg,Why didn't I get to see the lawnmower scene?!,10,28 March 2006,"Before Peter Jackson became famous for Hobbits and giant apes, he made this disgustingly hilarious flick about some gross occurrences in 1957 Wellington. When elderly Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) gets bitten by a rat-monkey at the zoo and becomes a zombie, her son Lionel (Timothy Balme) ends up with more than a few problems! Every person whom she bites becomes a zombie, and Lionel can't even tell anyone what's happening! In fact, everything seems to convince people that he's either crazy or a crook. Go figure! Watching ""Braindead"" (called ""Dead-Alive"" in the US), one gets the feeling that it's a joke, or that they at least made it for fun. I still crack up thinking about the priest. Unfortunately, I've heard all about the lawnmower scene but never seen it; the original video release in this country didn't show it. I sure hope to eventually see it.All in all, in the near future we may be speculating on how it is that New Zealand - the country that gave us ""The Piano"" - also gave us this movie. But no matter. We shouldn't ask why they made this movie; we should just accept it as what it is: pure, unadulterated fun. Whether it's the funeral or the end sequence, this one's a riot from start to finish. You may just want to go to Wellington after seeing this.",Dead Alive
8,jboothmillard,Braindead,10,14 August 2006,"I always thought The Evil Dead was the goriest film I had ever seen, but I remember seeing this film once before, and seeing it again, I thought it was just as gory, maybe more so, from director Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, The Lord of the Rings, King Kong). Basically, set in Wellington, New Zealand, 1957, shopkeeper's daughter Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Peñalver) has a card reading from her psychic Grandmother (Davina Whitehouse), who tells her she will meet her new love with a certain sign, and it it Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) that makes this sign. He is the awkward so and so who lives with his domineering Mum, Vera (Elizabeth Moody), and he can hardly do anything without her being involved, especially not fall in love. While going to the zoo, Lionel and his mother look in the cage of the newest addition, a hideous Sumatran Rat-Monkey, taken from Skull Island, infested with a deadly virus, which bites Vera on the arm. Slowly what starts as a very bad bit to the arm and sickness for Lionel's mother turns into a hideous bulging wound and a disgusting looking woman with horrible table manners. After seemingly dying of her hideous condition, bursting like a volcano with green goo, the now zombie mother starts biting other people in the near village, turning them into flesh eating creatures too. He tried to defend himself with his kung fu fighting, but priest Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie) and thug Void (Jed Brophy) are the two zombies, as well as Vera, Lionel tries to keep knocked out and locked up in the basement. Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) is victim to the zombie terror as well, and as the ""braindead"" creatures grow in number, there is also the appearance of a baby zombie, after the Father and Nurse have a hump. Uncle Les (Ian Watkin), who wants to take the house from Lionel now that he believes his mother is dead, holds a party inside the house, and the zombies manage escape, turning dozens of people into these crazed monsters as well. With Lionel, Paquita, Uncle Les and one or two others trapped in this nightmare, the only thing they can do is kill the zombies with whatever they can, whether it be working light bulbs, blenders, and in the blood splattered finale, a lawn mower. Also starring Jackson himself as the Undertaker's Assistant. Bad Taste was a cheap looking but quite funny horror, this one is a much better film from the early career of one of the best known directors, it is critically acclaimed being five stars out of five in fact. Everything you would expect to be be slashed and splashed is, but also you get unexpected terrors like living spinal columns and of course that memorable zombie baby giggling away, for any fan of outrageously sick and over the top gore movies, this is a must see comedy horror. Outstanding!",Dead Alive
9,BA_Harrison,Jackson's best film - a gore drenched delight!,10,10 March 2006,"In the early 90s, if you mentioned the name Peter Jackson to the average moviegoer, you probably would've received a blank stare. However, to fans of horror and cult cinema, he was already a hero, having directed the great low budget gore treat 'Bad Taste' and the downright bizarre puppet feature 'Meet the Feebles'.However, the best was yet to come in the shape of BrainDead. I originally caught the film at an all-night horror festival at the now defunct Scala cinema in King's Cross, and I was blown away by the sheer amount of cinematic carnage that Jackson and his team managed to splash across the screen during the 100-or-so minutes running time.Jackson takes the basic premise we all know and love from George Romero's 'dead' films  that a bite from a zombie eventually turns the victim into a shuffling reanimated corpse  and injects a huge dose of humour, resulting in the funniest splatter movie ever.From the opening scene on Skull Island to the lawnmower-dismemberment finale, the film never fails to amaze and astound. Gathered here in this one film are some the greatest gore effects ever committed to celluloid. The sheer inventiveness of the bloodletting is truly incredible and considering that the budget of this film was fairly low, some of the things the FX crew achieved are simply jaw-dropping.I won't go into detail about the effects, because to list them all would take ages  suffice to say that I think you will be impressed! It might be asking a lot, but I think it would be great if Peter Jackson returned to his roots and made his next project a sequel to this incredible gorefest.",Dead Alive
10,paul_haakonsen,A true classic...,7,27 October 2019,"""Dead Alive"" (aka ""Braindead"") is a zombie classic, and it has been ever since I first saw it back in the early 1990s on VHS. The sheer amount of gore is more than enough to make you stop and take notice of the movie.This is a gory zombie movie, no doubt about it, but it is also a movie that combines comedy and horror in a very good manner, and the end result is just a very hilarious and enjoyable zombie comedy.The movie starts out in a brisk tempo and doesn't really slow down, so there isn't really a dull moment throughout the course of the movie. And the storyline is very easily followed and it is a story that you quickly take a liking to.As for the characters in the movie, while they are very caricature and over-the-top, then it works out well for the movie, because it is not just one character that is that way, it is all of them. And they had a good ensemble of actors and actresses to perform the various roles. I think this movie is actually the only time I've seen Timothy Balme in a movie.The special effects in the movie are quite good. Well, aside from the stop-motion-animated rat monkey, which was just atrocious. But again, it fits well into the movie and the atmosphere, so you don't really mind the fake stop-motion used. And as I mentioned earlier, there is more than enough gore to make even the most seasoned of gore fans satisfied.""Dead Alive"" is a movie that you cannot avoid if you are a fan of the zombie genre. And if you haven't already seen it, you definitely should take the time to do so.I am rating this classic a solid seven out of ten stars. ""Dead Alive"" is well-worth the time and effort.",Dead Alive
11,Quinoa1984,I saw an epiphany of gore and weird horror in Jackson's delightfully outrageous effort,9,13 July 2002,"It would be hard to say that it wasn't difficult watching this. It was. It takes the realm of ""campy horror"" so far into another level that by the time the movie's over you'll feel it's brilliant or want to vomit. I felt both, and realized the film did come with flaws like jaws come with a zombie in this movie, and there was a point in this movie where I saw the creative peak of Jackson in his live action cartoon of a Romero movie gone berserk: An Australian man is walking along a carriage through the park, inside the carriage has barb wire blocking out an infant which not long before was BRED BY TWO ZOMBIES.... need I go on? Well, one thing would be to point out the performance by Timothy Balme which resonates of the lead character of Return of the Living Dead 3, who was a irritable, crazy person who would take care of his zombie girlfriend, here the lead does the same, except it's for his mother, a priest (that scene in the graveyard is hilarious), several bikers, and others, while a girl (Diana Penalver) sits in utter confusion till the bitter third act. Bottom line, this rivals over Evil Dead and the Living Dead trilogy in gore and comes very close to Eraserhead in bizarrely, and I can think of few other movies aside From Dusk Till Dawn where the blood quota could be used for a drinking game. But it is a little flimsy, and even the most die hard of gore and wacky B-horror fans may tire of it's over the top exuberance and terror in the guise of the apocalypse (does somebody really want to see a liver go after human flesh? maybe). Still, if anyone wanted to see another side to the now director of epics like LOTR and Kong, here it is.",Dead Alive
12,Coventry,The Lord of the GORE!,9,4 March 2004,"While writing this review, director Peter Jackson has just been honored with 11 (!) Oscars for his trilogy-fantasy 'The Lord of the Rings' Well made and exiting films of course, but not nearly as thrilling as the ones Jackson started his career with. During the late eighties and the early nineties, Jackson profiled himself as an absolute master in the horror genre. For the true cult-admirers and cheap horror lovers, Jackson will always be the one who brought them titles like Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles and..Braindead! Those exact same fans desire that, one day, Jackson will return to making gore-highlights again. Yours truly included.Braindead is one of them rare movies you can watch repeatedly .without EVER getting tired of it. Peter Jackson single-handedly set new standards here and attacks the audience with more blood, guts and pulp then anyone has ever done before. It's an outrageous and completely hilarious comedy.under the condition that your sense of humor isn't too easily offended, of course. Personally, I can't understand why someone would dislike this charming little mess. It is as creative, light-headed and unique as Jackson's previous escapades (Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles) but from a professional point of view: Braindead is a huge step forwards. Unlike with his extremely low-budget adventure (better say no budget at all) Bad Taste, Jackson now had some funds he could count on. And that shows!! From start to finish, you almost have to seek shelter for the overload of juicy zombie massacres, extraordinary eccentric characters and the morbid sarcasm. Timothy Balme is terrifically cast as the geek who suffers from his mother's tyranny.almost like girlish version of Norman Bates! He finds a little lovin' in the arms of the stunning Paquita, but mommy dearest disapproves their relationship. While trying to boycott her son's relationship, she gets bitten by a rat-monkey (a ghoulish monkey-species, indeed). The bite slowly causes mommy to turn into a ravenous zombie and everyone who comes close to the elderly house finds a nasty death. The gore and blood comes with entire buckets, people! The most common household items like blenders and lawnmowers are being used as deadly zombie-weapons. Meanwhile, there are kung-fu priests and fled nazi-doctors running around which is a real hoot, I assure you. Braindead is the ideal movie to 'sit-back-and-relax' and that is a guarantee! Take my advice on this one: invite a group of friends, make sure there's enough beer in the freezer, order a few pizza's and then watch this film together.",Dead Alive
13,Hey_Sweden,"""They're not dead, exactly, they're just...sort of rotting.""",9,25 October 2012,"One of the most invigorating zombie comedies ever made, filmmaker Peter Jacksons' ""Braindead"" a.k.a. ""Dead Alive"" is insane, uproarious, in-your-face fun, sparked by some of the most amazing gore that the genre has to offer. It also has appealing and entertaining characters, and a true ""anything goes"" attitude. Its hero is instantly sympathetic, and it will make all viewers develop a real appreciation for lawnmowers. It takes place in 1957 New Zealand, where young Lionel (Timothy Balme) is overwhelmed by a nagging mother (Elizabeth Moody). Lionel could find romance with saucy Paquita (Diana Penalver), but fate steps in when Mum is bitten by a hideous rat monkey from Skull Island, and the effect on Mum is to eventually turn her into a hungry zombie. She naturally spawns other zombies, and poor Lionel remains ever the dutiful, devoted son, trying to take care of her and the situation, even as things get totally out of control. People who basically know Jackson for his epic adaptations of the ""Lord of the Rings"" series should be amused to check out his early work if they're not already familiar with it. The potential viewer does indeed need to have a strong, strong constitution, but if they can appreciate the gore, they'll have a high old time with ""Braindead"". It goes so far over the top that one can see just how comedic it's meant to be. Among the characters that audiences can delight in are the delightful Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie), the man who kicks ass for the Lord, the sleazy and lascivious Uncle Les (the hilarious Ian Watkin), and swaggering punk Void (Jed Brophy). Among other things, there's a bit of zombie sex, a zombie baby, a memorable custard meal, and the party to end all parties. The creature and splatter effects are simply amazing, and it's all practical stuff, to boot. An irresistible dose of dark humour runs throughout, in addition to the amount of slapstick and farce that creates some truly hysterical moments. Of course, seeing the unrated version of this film is advisable, since you get even more bang for your buck. All in all, it may not be for all tastes but for some it's undeniably great entertainment.

14,poolandrews,"""Your Mother ate my dog!"" Absolutely brilliant gore drenched horror comedy zombie film.",10,15 March 2006,"Braindead is set in Wellington, New Zealand 1957 & sees Spanish shop assistant Piquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Penalver) falling in love with the likable Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) whose every thought & decision is controlled by his domineering Mother Vera (Elizabeth Moody). While at a local zoo, spying on her Son Lionel & Piquita, Vera is bitten by a vicious Rat-Monkey. The bite becomes infected & despite the best efforts of Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) Vera dies the following day, however she doesn't stay dead for long as she comes back as a flesh-eating zombie. Nurse McTavish is her first victim & she too rises from the dead, Lionel manages to lock them in his cellar & keep them sedated with tranquilisers. In a series of incidents that follow things spiral out of control, a mutant baby is born & more zombies are created as there seems to be no end to the bloodshed. To add to his problems Lionel's Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) turns up trying to get his hands on the Cosgrove fortune, is Lionel's relationship with Piquita doomed to failure? Will anyone discovers the horrors in Lionel's basement? It's well worth watching to find out...This New Zealand production was co-written & directed by Peter Jackson while he was still working outside the big budget Hollywood machine, he has gone on to make the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001 - 2003) & more recently the mega budget King Kong (2005) remake, he also has a small role in the film as the undertaker's assistant. According to the IMDb there are a few different versions of Braindead floating around with as much as 20 odd minutes difference between them, the version I will be commenting on is the full uncut 100 plus minute version that has been released in the UK containing all the gore. Now, what on Earth can I say about Braindead that hasn't already been said? Well nothing probably but in my opinion this has the the absolute finest, most brilliant, simply wonderful & just downright fantastic horror comedy ever, it's as simple & straight forward as that. The script by Jackson, Stephen Sinclair & Fran Walsh (who appears in the film credited as 'Mother at Park') has the absolute perfect combination of horror, gross out gore & comedy as it uses all three to wonderful effect throughout the entire film. I love all the over-the-top character's, from the hilarious Uncle Les to the tactless Mr. Matheson (Lewis Rowe), from the bizarre kung-fu fighting Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie) to the likable Piquita & Lionel whom I really started to feel for & the dodgy German veterinarian! The whole thing is brilliantly judged, is totally hilarious & just so entertaining. I love this film, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Jackson shows why he now virtually has a blank cheque from any major Hollywood studio to play with, Braindead is almost perfection in my mind. The way it's shot, the character's, the gore, the imagination & the thing moves along like a rocket. The only negatives things I can say about it is that I didn't like the ending that much & I thought the silly looking giant deformed monster spoiled things a bit. There are major continuity errors at the end, despite being covered in gallons of blood & guts at the very end when Lionel & Piquita are in the street their clothes show almost no sign of blood stains at all! While the amount of blood & gore in Braindead is highly commendable there is so much of it in quick succession that you feel slightly bombarded by it & don't have enough time to take it all in but that's a small criticism. I have seen a lot of horror films & I personally think that Braindead probably is the goriest I've seen, the sheer amount of blood spurting, severed limbs, impalings, lawnmower chopping action, flesh ripping & just general carnage is joyous to behold & is surely as extreme as any other film out there.With a budget of about $3,000,000 Braindead is very well made with some terrific special effects that will freak your girlfriend out. I'm currently thinking about a friend at work named Kelly, if I showed her this film I don't think she'd ever speak to me again! The acting is very good, Watkins as Uncle Les is just hilarious in every scene he's in. Apparently Braindead won best film, best director, best screenplay & best male dramatic performance at the prestigious 1993 New Zealand Film & TV Awards which upset a few people...Braindead is easily one of my favourite films ever & probably is my favourite horror comedy, I just think it's near perfection & as a film it contains everything I want & more besides. Although having said that it won't be the same for everyone. This is a film I could talk about all day & run out of superlatives to describe it but when all said & done I adore this film as much as any other I've ever seen.",Dead Alive

16,grantss,Silly and gross but also funny and fun,6,25 May 2020,"Wellington, New Zealand, 1957. Lionel and Paquita are at the zoo on date when Lionel's domineering, oppressive mother, Vera, appears, trying to prevent Lionel from seeing Paquita. Vera is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey and overnight becomes a zombie. Soon she infects others and Lionel is struggling to contain the zombie outbreak.Written and directed by Peter Jackson who later went on to direct Heavenly Creatures, The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, Braindead, his third film, is nothing like those movies. If, however, you've seen his first film Bad Taste, Braindead will be no surprise.Bad Taste relied heavily on a silly plot and gross-out special effects but was quite funny and generally quite fun. Braindead is similar but has a more solid plot, including a set up - Bad Taste just launched straight into the humans-vs-zombies/aliens action. There is still a lot of gross-out visual effects, many of which are silly and gratuitous, but some of them are really clever and funny. Some great laugh-out-loud moments.On that note, in Bad Taste the silliness pipped the funniness but here the laughs win out.

Not in the least. It's a gore-fest that combines non-stop action with incredibly stupid scenes which seem to go on forever. Yet somewhere in the midst of it all there is a story thrown in as well. Now, unlike some people I am not a fan of movies that are ""so bad it's good"". And this film is no exception to the rule.

In fact I tend to agree with what the box says saying it is the goriest film of all time.  Scary no, gory YES!!!!!!!!!!!!

She follows them to the zoo, gets bit buy a rat-monkey, dies, comes back as a zombie, and infects others...you know same ol' same ol'.

One of these movies was Bad Taste, which I found terribly funny, gory and it stuck with me until now. I am sure if I ever ask a high-school buddy if they remember it, they will!Now, Braindead is like Bad Taste with zombies instead of aliens. And better! Actually I can't believe I've never seen it until now. It succeeds beautifully in a genre that has a very tiny margin of success, horror comedies, masterfully mixing immense quantities of gore with funny scenes, scenes which are clearly well thought of and purposeful. The ideas are revolutionary! Shaun of the Dead has nothing over Braindead!Bottom line, a must see for every horror fan. It contains scenes of zombie mayhem, zombie love, zombie sex, zombie birth, zombie baby (this for the romantic side of the film, I guess :) ), blood baths, guts, zombie guts, mutant megazombie, reverse zombie birth (you have to see it to believe it) and, worst of all, dog getting eaten by zombies.

So I rented it without delay, not to mention I mean Peter Jackson?! With his directing skills this movie was aimed and ready for entertainment on my list. My mom grabbed the movie first and watched and she asked me ""Where did you hear about this movie? The mental institution?"" I laughed and was thinking maybe she didn't get it. She didn't get Evil Dead, how can she get another cult classic? Now my problem was, comedy and horror, two genres that can work very well together, but can make a disaster of a film unless used correctly. What was Peter making? I didn't know if it was a comedy or a horror flick, was I supposed to be scared or laughing my head off? The make up and acting were horrible even for a horror movie. I cannot believe that Peter made the great Lord of the Ring trilogy after this, because this movie was just trash.3/10",Dead Alive
22,MovieAddict2016,"It isn't funny enough to be a comedy, isn't scary enough to be a horror, and isn't convincing enough in its character development or subplots to make us care at all.",3,25 August 2006,"Peter Jackson's problem is very simply that he deals in extremes. He has never found moderation in his career and this is what will always prevent him from becoming a master of his craft. As a shock filmmaker in his early days he was quite effective  the passionate filmmaker who wasn't that great but kind of grabbed your attention once in a while with projects like ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Frighteners."" But today with his multi-million-dollar budgets his passion often blinds him. It's easy to see where this trend started, too: ""Braindead"" (or ""Dead Alive"" as it is known in the US) is considered a ""horror classic"" by Internet gore-flick geeks, and it is often compared to ""Evil Dead II"" in terms of its balance of humor and the macabre, but the ""Evil Dead"" series handled these elements far more successfully. Perhaps to the gore-lover ""Braindead"" will offer exactly what they want: buckets and buckets of blood. To most other viewers I imagine its flaws will hinder any level of serious enjoyment.Now, I understand it's a comedy (sort of), and I know it's not supposed to be a realistic horror film; but without any sense of a marginally realistic universe this film has no grounding, and its complete lack of character development doesn't help much, either. Those who just look for gore and wacky humor can perhaps overlook such ""trivial"" topics such as the clichéd, totally unconvincing (and borderline creepy) romance. Lionel (Timothy Blame) is practically stalked by Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Peñalver), and this unnecessary romance continues throughout the film. There's no chemistry, no spark  nothing. And I can't think of a single sane human being who would continue to pursue a relationship with a man after being treated the way Paquita is in this film by Lionel: the fact that Jackson tries to establish a romance later on in the film, when Paquita is seen yearning for Lionel while on a date with another man, is entirely laughable. If you're going to make a cheesy, gory horror film, then don't try to dump a stupid romance on top. Because the romance in this film is probably the most unconvincing relationship I've ever seen in any film in my entire life. That's hurtful to the film when it spends so much time focusing on this subplot.Then there's the fact that all these people in Lionel's town continue to die and turn into zombies (and they all end up living in his basement), yet no one wonders where the nurse got to. Or the priest. Or the gang leader. Or why the grave of Lionel's mother has been dug out from the inside.It's just completely stupid. And just because it's a horror-comedy doesn't mean any of these flaws should be excused. It's incredibly lazy film-making  the character development (of which there is none of any value) and romance between Lionel and Paquita are insulting throwaways offered by Jackson to fit the mandatory guidelines of horror films. Then there's the fact that Jackson tries to reference the Oedipal complexes of ""Psycho""  but Norman Bates had depth, and Lionel has none. Watching him tend to his mother doesn't ring true or look like something a caring, sheltered son would do  it looks like something an insane serial killer who wants to have sex with his mom would do. It's another poor call by Jackson in a film that isn't funny enough to be a comedy, isn't scary enough to be a horror, and isn't convincing enough in its character development or subplots to make us care at all.Lionel is supposed to be our hero, but I've never seen such a dull and unmoving protagonist in any film. Yeah, he's under pressure from his mother  we get it. But then when his mom dies, he doesn't react at all. It's another example of the total lack of reality in this film in terms of human emotion: at least Bruce Campbell had a breakdown in ""Evil Dead"" after his girl died. You got the feeling that he was real despite the absurdity of the flick. Lionel is just a big, bland waste of space.Sure, Blame is talented when it comes to the physical comedy, but his acting is nonexistent: he's worse than the people on commercials for Wheaties cereal. Where did Jackson find this guy, in a New Zealand bar on karaoke night or something? ""There, that drunk oaf singing 'Unchained Melody' in the wrong key  I want HIM for my movie!""He couldn't have found a less talented individual. And even his physical comedy isn't all that great  the whole Chaplin routine is kind of funny at first, but after the millionth exaggerated fight with a zombie it gets really old. Plus, the bizarre scene with Lionel nursing a mutated demon baby in a park and then proceeding to punt, kick, beat and throw the thing after it attacks him is like watching a train wreck: so much potential for this scene, and all it results in is a lame, childish sequence of frat-boy humor that brings to mind the atrocity committed by Tom Green in ""Freddy Got Fingered.The film has a good rating on IMDb. It has a strong Internet fanbase. And a lot of PJ fanboys have given it a revival in cult popularity. But if you're not a gore freak and you aren't a loser with no social life who thinks Peter Jackson is the best director in the world, you'll probably be smart enough to realize this is one of the worst films ever made. And I'm sure I'll get plenty of hate mail for single-handedly declaring all Ringnuts and Jackson fanboys are losers when I'm the guy spending time writing a review to post on the Internet, but hey, I never said I wasn't a hypocrite.",Dead Alive
23,KineticSeoul,Top wacky splatter zombie comedy!,8,13 June 2014,"Before Peter Jackson directed the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""The Hobbit"" films. He directed some really wacky and bizarre movies back in the day when he was younger. I am not sure what he was into back then, but this movie is pretty darn crazy. Now I personally don't watch a lot of blood and gore flicks, but if you are a audience member that likes splatter comedies, this one is up there. Watching this movie was like watching a ""Evil Dead"" movie, probably ""Army of Darkness"" with zombies in a early 90's setting. I for one didn't find this movie all that funny, but it does have few amusing parts for me. When it comes to the plot, it's about this guy named Lionel who is the hero of this story that has a mother that gets bit by a Sumaratan rat-monkey. Soon she gets sick, dies and turns in a zombie and starts eating everyone that is near her. Including dogs, nurses, friends and neighbors. Lionel is caught in the middle of trying to take care of this crisis while trying to save his relationship with his girlfriend. If you like over the top gore fest style movies with weird characters and decent development, this movie might be worth checking out. Instead of a lot of CGI effects that are used now a days, this one actually gets pretty creative when it uses props and other materials like stop-motion. You will get RIDICULOUS amount of blood in this. Even the zombies themselves have somewhat different traits that they bring to the table. However be warned, this movie really isn't for audiences with weak stomachs. This is one of those movies that is well worth seeing with buddies.8.3/10",Dead Alive
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Lawnmower man.,7,7 May 2021,"'Braindead (1992)' focuses on a young man whose overbearing mother accidentally becomes patient zero for a mysterious, zombifying virus after she's bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey from Skull Island (a place that director Peter Jackson would one day return to). The first two thirds of the piece play out almost unlike anything else; it's certainly a unique zombie movie. That's not to suggest that its final third is any less distinct, just that it more readily conforms to what you'd expect from the genre. The picture is a blatantly bizarre, charmingly schlocky, unashamedly puerile piece of 'splatstick' entertainment. The movie is, infamously, incredibly violent; in fact, some sources claim it's the bloodiest movie ever made, with over 300 litres of fake blood being used in a single sequence. The affair isn't especially scary or upsetting, though. It's a comedy, first and foremost, and it uses its over-the-top gore primarily for laughs. It's surprisingly funny, too; its shocks often translate to chuckles. However, that's not to imply that it's for the feint of heart. It has more than its fair share of stomach-churning set-ups (most of which look surprisingly convincing despite their absurdity), and even its mildest of zombie-killing moments are more explicit than most others in the genre. Let me be clear: it's not gore for the sake of gore. It's gore for the sake of comedy and it does exactly what it sets out to. It isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's an ambitious, inventive and in-your-face experience from beginning to end. It's also incredibly creative. Seriously, I've never seen some of this stuff before. The special effects are simply sublime, walking the line between preposterous and plausible. It's awards-worthy stuff, inherently enjoyable to behold. It's actually hard to look away from, even if some of it screams for you to avert your eyes. It's disgusting, but decidedly tongue-in-cheek. Its only real flaw is the fact that its second act is very stop/start and doesn't have all that much forward momentum. Still, its finale more than makes up for this; it's unrelenting, unflinching and, frankly, almost unparalleled. Overall, this is a strange but satisfying 'splatstick' comedy. It's very entertaining - if you can handle it, that is. 7/10.",Dead Alive
25,bowmanblue,Bl00dy brilliant!,9,9 July 2019,"Long before Peter Jackson's name was linked with mega-budget films, such as the 'Lord of the Rings' saga, 'King Kong' and whatever others he's done since, the writer/director (and sometimes actor) seemed more in favour of crazy, over-the-top gore and silliness. I'm not saying that the 'Lord of the Rings' movies weren't awesome, as Jackson is a very talented director. However, there are times when I pine for a drop of twenty of the 'red stuff' flying in all directions.Whether you know the film as 'Braindead' or 'Dead Alive,' it's set about fifty years ago in a quiet little down in New Zealand. A young man called Lionel's life starts off simple enough, looking after his overbearing mother (perfectly played by Elizabeth Moody), until she's bitten by a 'rat monkey' during a trip to the zoo. Instead of just reporting this and getting the appropriate medical attention, they let the wound fester and slowly, but very surely, she starts to change into a zombie, before doing what the undead do best... biting - and therefore spreading - their plague.Unfortunately, during this particular zombie apocalypse, no one thought to just call Rick and Daryl from 'The Walking Dead' to just shoot these ghouls in the head. Lionel isn't the type to wield a crossbow or magnum, instead choosing the more gentile option of simply locking them in the basement and sedating them in between meals of bowls of custard (did you know zombies also eat custard? Well... apparently, they do).Sadly, regular meals of sugary dessert is no match for a zombie's thirst for human flesh and Lionel soon finds himself the custodian of more and more of them, until... well, if you've seen one zombie movie then you know how they eventually turn out. What transpires is just one epicly-hilarious horror film. I know it's largely known for its gore (which is a fair point). However, if you're expecting something that is gory AND scary, then this isn't it. 'Braindead' knows it's silly and plays up to it at every moment. It's more of a comedy than a horror, with moments of - brilliant - gore thrown in there. It's true... you're unlikely to see a more gory movie to this day and, to make things even better, being made in 1992 all effects were practical and therefore a lot more 'real' than the regular CGI-fest we get today.The performances from the central two characters (Timothy Balme and Diana Penalver) and as good as any you'd expect to see in a horror movie, but the real stars are (as I already mentioned) Elizabeth Moody as Lionel's evil mother (and that's just BEFORE she became part of the undead!) and also Ian Watkin, as Lionel's truly disgusting 'Uncle Les.' The local priest also made me laugh, but isn't in the film for a long as he probably could have been, but his notable line of 'I kick a$$ for the Lord!' will live with me forever. I'm not sure I can count a certain 'infant' zombie as a 'character,' but, again, little 'Selwyn' will also be a continued source of amusement for me.I read online that, in the final act of 'Braindead,' they got through about five gallons of blood per second (or something like that - either way, it was a lot!). That should tell you all you need to know about the film. It is totally disgusting, possibly the more gory film you're likely to find, it's totally over-the-top and crazy and, if you're into something like that, it's definitely the one for you. Plus it has the lines, 'Your mother ate my dog!' in it and the subsequent response, 'Well... not all of it.'",Dead Alive

27,Cineanalyst,Grotesque Excess,7,28 April 2020,"""Braindead,"" a.k.a. ""Dead Alive,"" is an amusingly eccentric exercise in excessive gore and the grotesque. For fans of comedic zombie exploitation, it doesn't get much better than this. The camerawork, including oddly angled close-ups and strange tracking shots, the stop-motion animation for the ""rat monkey"" and infant zombie, the characterizations, acting and some silly lines are felicitous to this offbeat tone. And the lawnmower scene tops it all off. It's an impressive early effort from director Peter Jackson.I also thought it interesting that the rat-monkey is taken from ""Skull Island,"" the same place from which King Kong was enslaved in the 1933 film before he escaped his stage to wreak havoc on ""civilized"" society. Same sort of thing happens here at the zoo. Of course, Jackson would return to Skull Island, too, to remake ""King Kong"" in 2005.",Dead Alive
28,sol-,How weak is a human body?,7,29 June 2006,"I cannot think of a more putrid and disgusting film that this one, and that is perhaps something to admire about the film. There is no way that one can walk out of this film without having felt something - the excesses of horror and gore, and the violence shown, such as someone's face being ripped off, or someone's legs being ripped so that only bones remain - are a shock to the senses. Every form of atrophy and mutilation of the human body is shown on screen: a visually disturbing comment on how fragile our human bodies are and how poorly we are able to defend ourselves if attacked.Timothy Balme as the protagonist, an introverted weakling, is reminiscent of the protagonist in Peter Weir's 'The Cars that Ate Paris'. As in Weir's film, the protagonist discovers and shows others that he has power even if it does not appear so on the outside. Jackson's film is a black comedy, and part of the comedy comes from how Balme is able to withstand numerous zombie attacks despite being having such a weak personality and physique. The outwardly strong characters are the ones who die in the film, while the supposedly inwardly strong ones survive.Despite the depth of Jackson's film, it ultimately becomes a mess, with repetitive attacks by zombies and blood everywhere. The story seems to halt after a certain point and becomes slaughterhouse galore. There is also a distinct lack of logic in the film. A rare rat is an infectious zombie? Zombies are able to have sex and immediately produce babies? Zombies can evolve to a state where they are able to talk? All different types of zombies can be formed too, like a variety of different monsters? Also, the baby zombie and certain other aspects seem added in for pure comic effect, with little thematic concern.Still, what is shown is generally effective. The camera-work is amazing, with plenty of low camera angles, intense close-ups and interesting camera movements to frame the action in unnaturally foreboding ways. The special effects are also quite good, with the exception of the stop animation on the rat monkey that is so obviously fake that it is funny for the wrong reasons. Jackson has created certainly one of the most interesting zombie movies ever made. If not quite perfect, it does at least leave you thinking once it is over.",Dead Alive

And in that way, this is pretty effective.Most gore films have very shallow, clichéd and boring characters (That usually appear in any of those movies just to have a violent death) In ""Braindead"", instead, the characters are very likable and interesting, avoiding most of the stereotypes from other horror films. The plot is something pretty original and funny, and it never takes itself too seriously. That's why despite all the violence and blood, this film ends being something very enjoyable.

32,BaronBl00d,Jackson's First Trip to Skull Island...,5,29 December 2005,"Oscar winning director Peter Jackson directs this funny, gory film about what happens when a domineering mother eavesdropping on her son is bitten by the elusive rat monkey of aforementioned Skull Island. It seems a bite from this chimp will soon turn you and anyone you come in contact with by sharing bodily fluids into a killing brain dead machine. Well, as far as zombie flicks go, this one is pretty decent. It is definitely constructed with tongue firmly implanted in cheek. Jackson goes for the jugular with his use of splatter, but really none of it is particularly frightening. Jackson also shows us his penchant for weird special effects and creatures. Here, we are given a huge giant of fat waltzing across a roof, a baby that just cannot be kept down, and a bizarre head on spine concoction. The effects for their time are quite imaginative, and Jackson's sense of humour is pervasive. The scene in the park with Balme and the child are just priceless! Lead Timothy Balme does a workmanlike job as the dutiful, downtrodden son who has fallen in love with a Spanish girl named Paquita(or as his uncle calls her ""a nice bit of something""). Diana Penalver plays her to perfection, but it is the supporting cast which really makes this movie move. Elizabeth Moody excels as dear old...and decayed...mom. Stuart Devenie as a kung fu fighting cleric had me in stitches. But it is Ian Watkin as a repulsive, fat, greedy uncle who steals every scene he is in. This guy has a great sense of timing. Jackson shows us in this film his ability to construct story and create suspense as well as use special effects. Is it any wonder he made King Kong when he opens this film with a short introductory scene with a New Zealand zoo keeper trying to bring back this rat monkey from Skull Island. That scene sets the mood for the rest of the film, and though it is very gory - it is not one of the goriest or sickest films ever made as some might have you believe. It's use of blood and guts, I thought, was rather restrained and very, as I said before, unrealistic. It's nothing say to a Hellraiser movie in terms of blood and guts. That suits me just fine.",Dead Alive
33,Anonymous_Maxine,Your mother ate my dog!,8,12 February 2005,"Dead Alive is one of the goriest splatter films I've ever seen, with a level of comedy and extremism that approaches that of the Evil Dead films. It's amazing how different this movie is than the Lord of the Rings films, both in style and, even more, obviously, in content. With the Wachowski brothers, you could at least see the seeds of their style in earlier, trashier movies like Bound. I won't spend much time comparing this to The Lord of the Rings, because I'm sure anyone who has watched it anytime in the last four years did so because Peter Jackson went from making movies like this to making one of the biggest and best trilogies ever made.The movie is so grotesque that it has created something of a cult following despite being something of a conglomeration of a great many other horror films. Many of the zombies move and look very similar to those in the Evil Dead movies; the main character, Lionel, looks and acts strikingly similar to Dr. Herbert West from Re-Animator and, when we first meet him, he's a grown man under the complete control of his mother (as in Willard) and then later he's obsessed with his dead mother, although for slightly different reasons than Norman Bates. The gore effects look exactly like those in Day of the Dead (the sick one of the Night of the Living Dead films), especially when zombies bite people and pull on their elastic skin. Not very realistic, but then again, I've never seen someone bite into anyone else, so maybe that's what it really looks like.It all starts when some zoologist brings a rat-monkey with mystical powers to a zoo in New Zealand, against the advice of the locals of the island where it was found, who fear it like a malevolent god. Ultimately it ends up at a zoo where it routinely punches and eats monkeys in neighboring cages and, when it is lucky enough to get it's creepy clutches on a human, it starts making zombies.From this point on, it is really a pretty routine zombie movie, but what stands out is the sheer magnitude of the gore. It all started with Lionel's mother, who is the one who got bitten by the monkey at the beginning of the movie. Before long, her wound is festering and explodes this absolutely disgusting, creamy, bloody substance all over the wall.Check this out, when I was watching this scene, I had made the mistake of eating dinner, which in most cases wouldn't be too horribly bad. I've eaten plenty of meals while watching horror movies, but when this scene came on, I was eating onion rings and dipping them in a mixture of ketchup and ranch dressing. It's actually pretty good, I recommend it, but NEVER eat it while you are watching this movie! Never in my life have I come so close to vomiting because of a movie I was watching, it was awful. I fed most of the rest of them to the dog.In addition to that, a guy gets his entire rib cage ripped out, a zombie punches a girl in the neck from behind, shoving his fist through her head and out her mouth, a poor fat guy east pudding with a nice serving of the above-mentioned fluid flowing and pussing from Lionel's mother's wound, more than one person is halved (and not stopped), one zombie gets some hedge clippers through the mouth and beheaded, one poor girl gets a light fixture through the back of her head which then glows and later ignites, and of course, Lionel plows through a roomful of zombies with a lawnmower in what is probably the most famous scene in the film.And not only is that not all, that's not even HALF of it. Blood and guts are everywhere in this movie, it is absolutely unbelievable. Five years earlier, Peter Jackson directed a movie called Bad Taste. I think that in this movie the extent of bad taste is illustrated in a scene where a fart loudly emanates from a disembodied large intestine. I have seen hundreds and hundreds of horror films, and there were dozens of things in this movie that I had never seen before (Lionel's mother, for example, eats her own ear in one scene). The return of Lionel's mother at the end of the movie is truly a spectacle to behold.If Timothy Balme was as good of a comic actor as Bruce Campbell this movie would have been as funny as the Evil Dead films (consider, for example, the scene where Lionel enters with the lawnmower with the strong backlight and the one liner  ""Party's over."" That's Ash talking). It does, after all, feature countless morbidly amusing scenes as the farting intestine, an incessantly giggling alien baby, lot of severed heads getting kicked around like soccer ball (one of which slides all over the floor before finally being put into a blender and liquefied), there are countless organic explosions, if I can be excused a massive euphemism, and a circus music soundtrack throughout much of the film.Dead Alive is not a scary movie, it's a horror movie (note that there is a difference). It is never scary, but it is truly gruesome. Marilyn Manson released an album a couple years ago called The Golden Age of Grotesque (which is also the name of one of the better songs on the album), and I could swear it was named in reference to this movie.As far as sheer volume, this is by leaps and bounds the goriest film I've ever seen in all my life, I can't wait for the 4-disc New Line Platinum Edition!",Dead Alive
34,videorama-759-859391,"A horror classic with brains, and in no way dead",8,9 October 2014,"He's finally done it. Jackson has finally created something that is a gore fest and a half, the last half hour, almost non stop with it. Whereas Bad Taste was cheap and had repulsive gore, was slightly funny, where in between this were some long stretches of boredom, and was just plain stupid, here Jackson has made a much smarter film of better quality, where so far, this was his best. Braindead is a romantic horror tale, where boy introduces girlfriend to mother, where they make the dreaded mistake of going to the zoo. The mother is bitten by a Samutrian Rat, something I'd never wanna be bitten by, especially if the rat was infected, as I can recall. As to how this horribly ensues, all I can say, is strap in for one hell of a zombie fest, no holds barred, and I'm talking buckets of the stuff. High level horror fans won't be disappointed as Jackson has really shown what he's capable of with this mainstream, pre Lord Of The Rings, pic. Trivia note: Braindead took two years to hit video shelves.",Dead Alive
35,dee.reid,I now have a newfound appreciation for lawnmowers!,10,22 October 2011,"(Gore films with slapstick humor don't get any better than this!)Before he was the ""Lord of the Rings,"" I suppose that New Zealand's Peter Jackson had to start somewhere. While 1992's ""Dead Alive"" is not the director's first time behind the camera, it is, in fact, his most well-known (read: notorious, infamous) film before the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy made him a Hollywood big shot and big-time Oscar-winner. If two words could be used to some up ""Dead Alive,"" it's ""gore galore!"" In fact, it's impossible to in any way mention ""Dead Alive"" without also thinking, ""Gore, gore, gore!""It has been thoroughly suggested by some (by some names as big as Mexico's Guillermo del Toro) that Jackson's pre-""Lord of the Rings"" films - this one, ""Heavenly Creatures"" (1994), ""The Frighteners"" (1996), and others - were merely blueprints for the future ideas he would lay out in his epic cinematic trilogy that adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's books to the big screen, or were simply previews of what was to come in just a few short year's time.As a fan of zombie movies (1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the supreme epic of zombie movies, in my honest opinion!), ""Dead Alive"" has long been on my ""to-watch"" list, but I just somehow never got around to it... until tonight. I knew of ""Dead Alive"" through ""Fangoria"" magazine and held a passing interest in the film over the years, but I finally bought it on Blu-ray DVD a few weeks ago, and I was thoroughly impressed, and thoroughly disgusted, by Peter Jackson's supreme epic of gory zombie-horror mayhem! And damn, is ""Dead Alive"" gory, and hilarious! ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) is mere child's play compared to ""Dead Alive"" (but I still love ""Evil Dead II""!); I thought ""Evil Dead II"" was the ultimately happy-go-lucky ""B""-movie splatter-fest, but I was proved wrong by this ultra-gory 1992 cult classic from New Zealand's most prolific filmmaker.Jackson really seems to aim high to outdo himself at every turn; if you think he's got Sam Raimi or Tom Savini beat - Savini's gory make-up effects and Raimi's manic, ADD-charged camera-work - he does. Whereas the savage violence/gore of ""The Evil Dead"" (1982) genuinely scared the living daylights out of me and ""Evil Dead II"" proved that laughs and gore are indeed possible, ""Dead Alive"" further continued the notion that the American laugh-'n-gore template can indeed be carried overseas with fabulous results.In 1957, a New Zealand zoologist recovers the dreaded ""Sumatran Rat-Monkey,"" which is the carrier of a lethal zombie virus, and is bitten by the loathsome creature before being diced to bits by his native forest guides in order to ""save him."" Cut to Wellington, Lionel (Timothy Balme) is under the authoritative yoke of his over-bearing and controlling Mum (Elizabeth Moody). Mum is bitten by the dreaded Sumatran Rat-Monkey at the zoo, gets sick, dies, and comes back to life as a ravenous zombie. Being the good son that he is, Lionel stashes her in the cellar and tries to go back to a normal life, by attempting to romance the lovely neighborhood beauty Paquita (Diana Penalver). Before you know it, Mum gets loose and thus spreads a living dead epidemic that threats to consume his entire town!Well, here it is: the movie that the ""New York Daily Times"" proudly proclaimed, ""The goriest fright film of all time!"" I was thoroughly on the edge of my seat the entire time during its 97 minutes. The movie does not really have a message (it may be about Lionel trying to crawl out from under the thumb of his domineering Mum, culminating in a symbolic ""return to the womb"" late in the film), but to me ""Dead Alive"" is really more of a celebration of the art of special effects in the early 1990s, and a consolidation of strengths.Jackson's camera is never once steady. It pans wildly across the screen and zooms in on the character's faces and gives the viewer all kinds of crazy angles from which to view the film; it lends ""Dead Alive"" a unique comic book feel (well, the whole movie never takes itself seriously to begin with and if you try to, you're in for a rude awakening) that has yet to be topped. The unique mix of humor (even slapstick, or ""splat-stick"") and gore is incredible. And speaking of special effects, the special effects are this film's greatest and most celebrated achievement. The outrageous gore effects, miniatures, and stop-motion camera-work by Bob McCarron and Richard Taylor deserve special mention for simply being outrageous and disgusting; you can spot the obvious love of ""King Kong"" (1933), George A. Romero and David Cronenberg movies, and Ray Harryhausen at every opportunity. They cease being scary after about the first or second evisceration and quickly fly into comic book territory. (Again, don't waste your time trying to take anything you see here seriously.) This is in a nutshell, the ultimate gore film.The following scenes stand out:The opening sequence on Skull Island (""King Kong,"" anyone?),The dinner scene where Mum is decomposing into her meal before our very eyes and that of her dinner-mates,The kung-fu fighting priest,The ""baby in the park"" scene, and of course,The mother of all gore sequences, the infamous ""lawnmower scene""!Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" is one of the best and greatest horror films I've ever seen. Maybe ""horror"" is not the right word here because it's not really scary in the slightest; this is by far the bloodiest ""comedy"" ever made!10/10P.S.: ""Dead Alive"" is a nasty one, so make sure you have a barf bag ready!",Dead Alive

A great line in this fantastically entertaining descent into splatter-filled zombie madness done the epic Peter Jackson way!",10,14 December 2019,"So in this horror flick which is actually a period piece set in the fifties, a henpecked young man's foul domineering mother gets bitten while spying on him and his date at a local zoo by a toxic rat-money that was stolen and imported from darkest Skull Island, yes that one, and soon after messily sickens and dies, only to explosively come back to life as a mutating, ravenous zombie that spreads a plague of undeath as she begins eating dogs, nurses, punks and neighbors! To me this is Peter Jackson's best film, no offense to you Hobbit lovers, it's just so full of youthful energy, inventive kills, innovative special effects, and a hell of a lot of laughs. Oh my heavens the gore in this movie is just incredible, and the gallons of blood and guts on display have a certain look that's cartoony enough that's it's never nasty to the point of being unpleasant and not fun, although there's definitely practically every kind of nasty thing you could think of and even a few new ones that go down in this picture! It starts on a small scale and by the end you just have all out madness in a house that's full of zombies, killer entrails, yes, monster babies and a gigantic mum-rat beast that are all hungry for blood! It's an achievement in splatter horror it really is, and you just don't get films as crazy and cool as this one anymore, it's such a blast. There are plenty of horror movies with more realistic and effectively disturbing gore, but in terms of sheer volume this one absolutely tops them all! It has a good story with even a sweet little love story put in but the primary focus is on the gore and the comedy which is fine to me because it all worked out beautifully. It's so damn funny, and two scenes that always get me are when Lionel for whatever reason takes the wicked mutant baby Selwyn out for a stroll in the park and a scene involving custard that's as stomach-churning as it is hysterical! I really love this movie I always did, it's such an insane treasure, there's really not another quite like it.

39,drownnnsoda,Jackson's funhouse of bodily horrors,8,26 December 2014,"Set in the 1950s, ""Dead Alive"" follows a young man whose mother gets bit by a monkey at a New Zealand zoo. After returning home, mama falls inexplicably ill and dies, only to come back to life as a flesh-eating monster who infects an entire host of locals.Also known as ""Braindead,"" ""Dead Alive"" has garnered a cult following over the years among genre fans, and it's easy to see why. Jackson's quirky black humor is interspersed with increasingly macabre hi jinx and bodily gross-outs, and the proceedings and dramatic irony involved make the film thoroughly enjoyable. The film has all the makings of an after school Halloween special, except it's inexorably violent; the special effects on display are the chief attraction here, playing second fiddle to the clever and witty writing. The film has gained infamy worldwide for the excessive gore factor, and it's deserved— that said, a lot of it is so over-the-top and even cartoonish at times that it's unlikely to actually churn stomachs, and more likely to induce gag laughs.Overall, ""Dead Alive"" is an early nineties gem that put Peter Jackson on the map for horror fans. It's gaudy and disgusting and funny all rolled into one. Not a serious film by any means, but a remarkably entertaining gore flick with zombies and overbearing mothers and runaway intestines. You may squirm in your seat, but you'll also be laughing your way through it. Just wait for the finale— it's to die for. 8/10.",Dead Alive

This film is so gory, so over the top and so fun that it became an instant cult classic. Everything was done so well here too, its hard to find a complaint.

42,Witchfinder-General-666,Gorgeously Gory and Hilariously Grotesque Zombie-Satire,9,6 July 2009,"Peter Jackson is world-famous for directing the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy - highly entertaining and well-made films, of course, but for Horror/cult-cinema fans like myself, the true gems in Jackson's filmography will always be his bizarre early films. And ""Braindead"" (aka. ""Dead Alive"") of 1992 is doubtlessly the most memorable of these films. This grotesque and unspeakably hilarious Zombie Gore Slapstick Satire is widely considered to be one of the goriest films ever made. And it is. It has to be said though, that the gore is immense and often extremely disgusting, but never disturbing in this film. Peter Jackson had already made a very funny Gore-comedy with the bizarre ""Bad Taste"" in 1987, but while that film still had some major faults (extremely low production values, a boring middle part,...), ""Braindead"" promises perfect entertainment for anybody with a love for schlock and a sense for black humor. Back in the 90s, ""Braindead"" became one of my first gore-favorites as a teenager, and after seeing it many, many times, I still find it as hilarious as I found it the first time.The grotesque story starts in 1957, when a Sumatran 'rat-monkey' is brought to New Zealand. The Nerdy 25-year-old mommy's boy Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Blame), who has fallen in love with the enchanting Latina Paquita (Diana Peñalver), has his life turned upside down, when his evil, ultra-possessive mother is bitten by the rat-monkey and subsequently turns into a flesh-hungry zombie; as, subsequently, does the whole neighborhood... The film keeps getting more bizarre and hilarious with each passing minute, as the situation gets more and more grotesque. The gore keeps getting more and more (hillariously) disgusting. A totally nauseating 'dinner' sequence or a Zombie-sex-scene are only two examples. The film furthermore introduces a variety of eccentric characters, such as an ass-kicking priest, a deranged Nazi-scientist, a sleazy and greedy uncle, a gang of Rockabilly-zombies and even a Zombie-baby. The film is full of extremely gory massacres, and yet, while the violence is extremely gory - in fact ""Braindead is doubtlessly one of the goriest films ever made - it is never disturbing or shocking, but always satirical and hilarious. Timothy Blame was the perfect choice for the lead here - Blame is perfect in the role of the nerdy hero Lionel. Diana Peñalver is beautiful and very lovable as his girlfriend, whereas Elizabeth Moody is absolutely diabolical as his abominable tyrant of a mother. While people who are sensitive about violence in films are, of course, well-advised to stay away from the film as far as possible, lovers of Horror, Gore and, especially, Macabre humor should love it. ""Braindead"" is definitely a 'love it or hate it' film. I am one of those who love this film, however, and I couldn't imagine for anyone not to like it, or at least find it funny. In short: ""Braindead"" is an out-and-out hilarious Splatter Spoof, which no Gore/Horror/Comedy lover should consider missing!",Dead Alive
43,ferbs54,The Outside Limit Of Twisted Horror Comedy,9,24 October 2007,"Many cinematic sons have had problems with their mother--just ask poor Norman Bates!--but perhaps none more so than Lionel Cosgrove, in Peter Jackson's third film, ""Dead Alive"" (1992). His mum, you see, after receiving a nasty bite from the accursed Sumatran rat-monkey at the Wellington Zoo in 1957, died (well, for a brief time, anyway), and soon came back to life as an extremely aggressive zombie gutmuncher. Before long, this contagion is fairly widespread, and Lionel and his girlfriend Paquita (who must surely rank as one of the spunkiest Latinas in horror-film history) are left to deal with a veritable army of the undead. Anyway, there is not a single moment in this film that doesn't either amuse, startle, or completely gross one out with hilarious, cartoonlike, completely over-the-top violence. The justly infamous climax, during which Lionel, armed with a handy power mower, tears through the zombie horde amongst gallons of spurting blood and heaps of flying body parts, must surely represent the outside limit of twisted horror comedy. It is just remarkable how much inventive carnage ""Dead Alive"" dishes out: from the antics of a zombie baby, to a fight between a kung fu priest and some undead punks, from a bout of zombie lovemaking, to the sight of a pureed zombie head in a blender, and on and relentlessly on. Jackson directs with great energy and panache, and generously supplies some pleasing and quite convincing period detail. His film ultimately suggests a sick amalgam of John Waters tastelessness and George A. Romero horror fare, but the zombies on display here, despite the comedic tone, are much faster moving and nastier than the Romero variety. ""Dead Alive"" works equally well as horror and comedy and, in its own sick and twisted way, is quite an accomplishment; a minor masterpiece.",Dead Alive
44,TOMNEL,On the line between disturbing and great.,7,13 March 2007,"Before Peter Jackson really hit it big with Lord of the Rings, he directed this odd, extremely gruesome and gory comedy/zombie movie.

One day after spying on Lionel and Paquita at the zoo, she get's bitten by a weird clay animated monkey rat and soon starts losing various body parts and growing a taste for human flesh. Once more people are bitten, Lionel tries locking them in the basement as to not let people know. It's a really bizarre tale with some very odd scenes. Among the most amusing scenes are a priest who quickly switches in to kung fu mode to beat up the zombies, and a zombie baby, conceived by two active zombies, runs amok at the playground. It's a very strange flick, but it's not without it's charm.My rating: *** out of ****. 83 mins. Either rated R or NC-17 for strong violence, some sex, language.",Dead Alive
45,Jonny_Numb,hilariously wild,8,10 March 2003,"I consider ""Re-Animator"" to be the most successful combination of the extremes of horror and comedy ever committed to celluloid, but Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" comes in a close second.  A truly visceral experience loaded with comedic gore and eccentric characters, it's a testament to the enduring popularity of the zombie film in modern times.  Unlike ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Re-Animator,"" the gore in ""Dead Alive"" is much easier to take because of its over-the-top nature, placing it closer to Monty Python than Romero.  My only complaint is that the climactic sequence where a house becomes infested with zombies, relies too much on the gag of people being choked with intestines.  Other than that, this is easily the strongest zombie film to come out of the last decade.  (Note:  Avoid the R-rated version, which runs 12 minutes shorter and is practically goreless.)8/10",Dead Alive
46,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Hilarious, Peter Jackson Zombie Film",8,12 July 2019,"This was a film that I remember seeing the box for the VHS at my local video store. For whatever reason though, I never pulled the trigger. My father loved zombies and I don't ever remember him saying anything about it, which in turn means I really like zombies as well. I heard a lot about this film through podcasts and eventually figured it was one that I really needed to see. I'm now updating this after a second viewing of this wild film. The synopsis is a young man's mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey. She gets sick and dies, at which time she comes back to life, killing and eating dogs, nurses, friends and neighbors.We start back in 1957. There's a man from New Zealand who goes to Skull Island, which according to this film is just off the coast of Sumatran. He is accompanied by a guide and he has collected a Sumatran Rat-Monkey, which is a mix of a virus-carrying slave-ship rat and a tree monkey. The man tries to show the natives that he has a right to take it, but they give chase. He doesn't make it though. He is killed by this native guides after he gets bit and scratched by the creature.In Wellington, we go to a shop. Here we meet Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Peñalver). She shows interest in a man who makes a delivery. She asks her grandmother (Davina Whitehouse) if she will end up with the man, even though he somewhat ignores her. The grandmother reads her tarot cards and tells Davina that there will be another man she falls in love with. It won't be easy though. There is then someone who enters the store. Her father, Silvio Famularo, tells her to go help whoever it is.It turns out to be Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme). We see he is clumsy, but Davina notices a sign that her grandmother spoke off. She tries to talk to him and he panics, leaving the store and managing to catch a trolley.He lives with his mother, Vera (Elizabeth Moody), and she is very controlling. We do see him trying to mow the lawn, after she tells him that it needs to be done. Davina shows up, bringing the list of items he requested. Vera doesn't seem too happy that they are talking.The two of them go on a date to the zoo. We see that by nature Lionel is off. He's also afraid of water. He tells a story of how he fell off a pier and his father tried to save him, but ended up being taken out to sea and drowned. They come up on a monkey enclosure and meet the viscous Sumatran Rat-Monkey. It tears the arm off a monkey in a different cage that gets too close. The two aren't alone either. Vera is spying on them from the bushes. She gets too close and is bit on the Rat-Monkey. She makes a scene, killing the creature in the process. Lionel is forced to take her home and leave Davina.Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) comes over to the treat the wound and it just gets progressively worse. The next day they are supposed to have Nora (Glenis Levestam) and Mr. Matheson (Lewis Rowe) over for lunch. Lionel wants to cancel, because Vera's infection is spreading and she is starting to fall apart. She demands they continue on with it. We get some disgusting scenes with bodily fluids and body parts falling off. It gets to the point where Nora flees and her husband is forced to follow.Despite their best offers, Vera passes away, but she just won't stay dead. We get some hilarious scenes as she spreads her new infliction to others which culminates in a wild scene back at the Cosgrove's house. Lionel and Davina will do whatever it takes to stop this plague from escaping and running all over New Zealand.Now I have to lead off saying that this is a fun film. It is pretty outrageous, but with this early Peter Jackson film, you see flashes of his talent. Don't come into this one expecting everything to make sense. Now the concept of how the zombie plague starts is pretty interesting. I'm not sure if the Sumatran Rat-Monkey is real, but it's interesting that is where an infection like this could start.Something I'm kind of curious to see this film if Jackson would have tried to play it straight with a little less comedy. Now according to zombie logical, Lionel and Davina would probably have turned, due to the amount of gore that gets on them, but that is something I'll let slide. Also I don't recall the couple that came for lunch turning, but the husband for sure should as he ate blood from Vera. It does have some funny parts as well as parts that made me cringe. That was pretty interesting from a horror comedy. I don't mind how this plays out, as it keeps up with how the film is portrayed.The acting I felt was pretty solid as well. Balme is great as the timid man that does whatever his mother tells him. He does learn a secret that changes his life and it is fun to see at the climax him growing into the hero. Peñalver was pretty cute, but her character is a tad unrealistic. She is so convinced that what her grandmother tells her through the tarot cards has to be true. It doesn't ruin the film, it just seems odd to me. The more I think about it though, with her upbringing, she probably would be this way. Moody is solid in the little time she has when she normal. You really get the feel she is extremely controlling. I'd say the rest of the cast is fine in rounding out the horror and comedic aspects of the film.It is crazy that Jackson is known for the Lord of the Rings films that are just CGI-fests. This film is a much lower budget and everything was done practical. It is crazy because I thought the effects, even things that are outrageous, still look real. The only things that really didn't were the Rat-Monkey, a zombie near the end and the Vera creature at the end. Those were down with stop-motion though, which I love. The Vera creature I'm not sure why it was as big as it was. This film had me gag a couple of times so I will give the film a lot of credit for that. The editing of the film was fine. It does build some tension, but being a comedy it does alleviate a little too much in that department. The story continues to build throughout. The score was fine in my opinion. It wasn't great, but no complaints.Now with that said, this is really one of the better horror comedies. You can see the early ability of Jackson that led him to do some of the things he has done after this film. This one has a nice back-story and interesting how everything develops. Some of it is outrageous, but that makes the film fun. I like the climax and the gore, which didn't freak me out too much due to just how over the top it was. The acting was pretty good I'd say, some of it is unrealistic, but you have to keep that in line with the film. The effects were amazing. The editing was pretty solid and the score was as well. This film is from New Zealand, so keep that in mind as the accents can be a bit tough to follow. If you like zombie films and like comedy with your horror, I'd definitely say give this one a viewing. It is over the top, but definitely fun.",Dead Alive

She is so convinced that what her grandmother tells her through the tarot cards has to be true. It doesn't ruin the film, it just seems odd to me. The more I think about it though, with her upbringing, she probably would be this way. Moody is solid in the little time she has when she normal. You really get the feel she is extremely controlling. I'd say the rest of the cast is fine in rounding out the horror and comedic aspects of the film.It is crazy that Jackson is known for the Lord of the Rings films that are just CGI-fests. This film is a much lower budget and everything was done practical. It is crazy because I thought the effects, even things that are outrageous, still look real. The only things that really didn't were the Rat-Monkey, a zombie later in the movie and the Vera creature at the end. Those were down with stop-motion though, which I love. The Vera creature I'm not sure why it was as big as it was. This film had me gag a couple of times so I will give the film a lot of credit for that.Now with that said, this is really one of the better horror comedies. You can see the early ability of Jackson that led him to do some of the things he has done after this film. This one has a nice back-story and interesting how everything develops. Some of it is outrageous, but that makes the film fun. I like the climax and the gore, which didn't freak me out too much due to just how over the top it was. The acting was pretty good I'd say, some of it is unrealistic, but you have to keep that in line with the film. The effects were amazing. The editing was pretty solid and the score was as well. I do feel that the film is a bit long though. This film is from New Zealand, so keep that in mind as the accents can be a bit tough to follow. If you like zombie films and like comedy with your horror, I'd definitely say give this one a viewing. It is over the top, but definitely fun.",Dead Alive
48,lastliberal-853-253708,That's my mother you're pissing on.,8,5 August 2012,"There are no name actors in the film, but it did win a basketful of awards, and it is directed by Peter Jackson (King Kong, Lord of the Rings).Timothy Balme expertly plays Lionel, whose old bat mother (Elizabeth Moody) is turned into a zombie, and who is chased by Diana Peñalver, who believes him to be the man of her dreams. Lionel is, for some reason, oblivious to her charms whilst he tries to contain his mother's gory actions.There is plenty of comedy, gore, blood, and even martial arts from a priest (Stuart Devenie) who ""kicks ass for the Lord."" And, did I mention zombie sex? Lots of interesting characters like Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) and Paquita's (Peñalver) father (Silvio Famularo) and grandmother (Davina Whitehouse).Amazing special effects, and great direction by Mr. Jackson.",Dead Alive

He's executed a superb horror-comedy here and done it complete justice. It's quirky, violent, gory and also very silly at times and Peter Jackson has really taken it to the extremes where possible. It is a visual extravaganza not to be missed for the horror-comedy buffs. Gather a few friends around and watch this. You will not be disappointed.",Dead Alive
50,RainDogJr,Sumatran Rat-Monkey: a rare species resulted from the rape of some monkeys by rats,10,1 June 2008,"*Written on 30 May 2008*Business are business and in order to gain some money is not very important the consequences that can result if you take a Sumatran Rat-Monkey to Wellington, New Zealand. And that's how this film begins and upon that we are going to watch the gory situations that the Rat-Monkey will bring to the people of Wellington. Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) is a young man from a very rich family. Paquita (Diana Peñalver) is a young woman who works at a local shop and whose entire family believes in what the cards may say. This two will start a relationship but for their misfortune Lionel's mother (Elizabeth Moody) is an old racist woman will try to avoid that Lionel spend time with Paquita. This part of the film is just the introduction to the characters that will be part of the problems that the Rat-Monkey will bring and certainly is when this unique, bizarre and amazing creature finally appears ( yes the Rat-Monkey looks very cool) when this film really begins and upon that, the fun, the gore, the creativity and the zombies will never abandon the screen. The character of Lionel is just great (a great performance of the unknown Balme) and the fact that his mother is the first infected will just confirms the excellent son that Lionel is and the love between a mother and a son. So we are going to see how Lionel will take care of his mother after she begin to turns into a living dead and is so funny how in order to protect his mother, Lionel hides her and tries to continue with his regular life but of course he can't control a zombie so eventually there are going to be more and more infected persons. Is hilarious to see Lionel hiding every zombie and all together looking as a true family, yes a rare family. The film is full of gore and there is a gory moment everywhere, with really cool visuals with a lot of creativity, just like hilarious moments but of course there are the moments and also the zombies that are more memorable than the rest. To list and remember some, there is a really cool father who has another interest apart of being a pederast. Yes the father is also a really good fighter and his fighting scene is nothing but memorable. Later as a zombie, he becomes a dad and his baby is probably the most memorable zombie of the film. The final party is the greatest sequence of the film, of course, and definitely a very gory reunion so in order to end with the zombies, including his mother, Lionel and Paquita must cover their entire bodies with some blood, well actually with tons of blood. Conclusion: What a gory, funny and memorable zombie picture with wonderful special effects. When you see for the very first time the Sumatran Rat-Money is just really cool but actually you will almost forget that great scene, of course after a really bloody final massacre. Anyway, I still don't think that all the fans of Peter Jackson's Rings will enjoy this film as I did (for example my sister) but definitely all the people who claim that are true Cinema lovers and believe that ""Rings"" will be the only films for what Jackson will be remember, well you better check this cult gem first. DVD: The only extra is the theatrical trailer but to have this film in my collection is the cool thing. I recommend you that if you want to see for the first time ""Dead-Alive"" (the USA title) you get this DVD with the uncut version because is a film to see more than once. PS: If you have the DVD of Jackson's Kong you better check the scene when the cage of the Sumatran Rat-Monkey is in the ship. Appears when the pianist (Brody) is at the animal storage hold inside the ship.",Dead Alive
51,nycritic,Demented Fun,8,6 March 2005,"Who would have imagined that in 1992 a film director of mainly cult movies would grow to the immense stature that he has today? I certainly didn't, but this is exactly the case with Peter Jackson, who then brought this extremely bizarre comedy-horror splatter-fest called BRAINDEAD, also known as DEAD-ALIVE, and between 1999 and 2003 cemented his status with the ubiquitous, monumental LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY.A simple premise that had by then done numerous times -- flesh-eating zombies wreck havoc among the living -- is taken not only to the ultimate extreme: here it just makes going over the top seem like a weak cliché. It completely jumps straight over a cliff and never bothers to return to any sense of normalcy. That this story of zombies gone amok has been dressed with an interesting Freudian spin -- over possessive mother tries to control her son's every move even after (un)dead, quite like PSYCHO -- only makes the hero's evolution from Mama's boy to unlikely survivor ever the stronger and gives the completely lurid tale some grounding even after it explodes left and right, literally, in pieces of flesh and still moving body parts.DEAD ALIVE has a lot to owe to EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN with its gleeful amounts of gore and truly slapstick scenes of crazy body parts, but it out-does it by the sheer volume of gore and blood that comes forth once the real madness begins. The fact that the aforementioned body parts have a will of their own makes for one rip-roaring sight gag after another in frenetic shots -- for example, one character's body snaps in two; his lower torso continues to amble about, his inner organs come ripped apart from his body and even take a peek at a mirror to see how they look, while the owner's upper torso gets partially flushed down a toilet. As a matter of fact, that same character's intestines take up quite a lot of screen time towards the climax as they chase the apparently hapless Timothy Balme around the house as his girlfriend, battling zombies in the kitchen, uses a blender to grind a hand that simultaneously tries to pull her in and all the while a baby zombie is becomes something of a tennis ball, bouncing about while creating yes, even more havoc. That is, until Balme goes berserk with a lawnmower and makes puree out of the entire lot of them. All this shows to what extremes the notion of the exaggeration of horror could be taken: the more blood and outrageousness, the less horrifying it becomes, and here, once it starts, it never lets up until its side-splitting finale.Definitely not for all tastes but for people who like their horror with a nice dose of Tex Avery lunacy, comedy as black as night and tanks of the red stuff -- this is horror comedy par excellence.",Dead Alive
52,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Absolutely disgustingly good,8,20 July 2012,"Out of all the zombie movies ever created, I have never witnessed one made with so many atrocities and somehow not allow me to lose my lunch. Even more surprising was that this was before director Peter Jackson was really known for making some big movies. And although no one hears about the actors who were in this movie, much of it still leaves a scarring impression for the better.Dead Alive is the story of a small town of civilians that become infected by a virus that turns its victims into flesh eating zombies. The origin of where this virus starts is at the house of Lionel Cosgrove played by Timothy Balme. The person to be infected first is his snooty grandmother (Elizabeth Moody) who never seems to be happy with anything. But before this even begins, the introduction alone is only a tiny glimpse of what monstrosity is coming the viewers way for the rest of the film.Honestly I can't even comprehend how this much gore was even acceptable let alone feasible. From singular moments to hoards of zombies, Jackson immerses his audience into what seems like a zombie paradise; where anything and everything is ripped to shreds and or eaten alive. Much of which I could not believe occurred. After watching the movie once, I had to go back and watch all the scenes I didn't think I had viewed.Turned out I wasn't hallucinating.Some people complain of adventure films having too much over the top action, well in a sense, this is a parallel to the horror genre. Dead Alive has over the top gore. I congratulate Richard Taylor's (creature & gore effects) ability to make some really horrific scenes but there were times that I felt like there needed to be an intermission so the main characters could take a breather. Instead, I got non-stop yuck.The comedy aspect I could have cared less for too. There weren't many scenes I laughed at. Most were just ""Ah,..funny"" moments. The zombie baby was a turnoff for me. It was at that part of the movie that made me feel like Jackson just put it in for us to not take seriously. It just didn't seem to match the rest of the tone in the film. However, the karate-chopping priest was neat and entertaining add-on. Overall it was an enjoyable and scarring experience.The intended comical scenes are silly and the gore may be excessive at times but what distinguishes itself from the rest is how abundantly it is relied on. Dead Alive is not for the squeamish.",Dead Alive
53,Matt_Layden,Tongue in Cheek Horror,8,15 August 2005,"Wow, what a film from Peter Jackson, the guy that went on to do LOTR. If you are a gore lover, this is ""the"" ultimate film to check out.Here is a movie that has comedy, zombies, blood, guts and lots of it...did I forget to mention a lawnmower. Which is one of the bloodiest scenes ever filmed, more or less on par with Kill Bill's House of Blue Leaves.I was hooked right from the beginning of this film when the two men climbed down in the rocks of the Island. BUT when looking for this film, make sure you get the UN-cut version, because the R rated version literally cuts everything up to pieces, this is a classic gore fest that should not be missed from any horror movie fan.It's one of those low-budget B horror movies, where you would expect there to be bad acting, which it has, bad special effects, which not exactly right, because for this film, the special effects were astounding. Three scenes in this film stand out in my mind, one is the opening, because you do not know what you're in for until you see the guy get hacked to bits!!!! Second would be the baby in the park scene, that goes down as one of the funniest scenes that I've ever seen. Of course the last one is a given, the lawnmower plowing through the zombies!!!!! Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed, with a house full of zombies and 3 people fighting to survive, limbs will falls, heads will fly and rib cages will be ripped out!!!",Dead Alive
54,slayrrr666,Entertaining zombie/gore opus,10,12 April 2007,"""Dead Alive"" is the most fun an over-the-top gore-opus can be.**SPOILERS**Living in New Zealand, Lionel Cosgrove, (Timothy Balme) meets young Pacquita Sanchez, (Diana Penalver) working in her family's general store. Thinking that he's her soul-mate, they agree to go out on a date, much to the annoyance of his hen-picking mother Vera Cosgrove, (Elizabeth Moody) who follows them to the zoo. While there, she gets bitten by a new exhibit, the Rat Monkey, and becomes infected with a ravenous disease, forcing Lionel to spend all of his free time with her and canceling on Pacquita. When his mother dies from the infection, he tries to grieve for her but finds that the infection keeps her from staying dead and soon finds himself needing to control a growing number of his mother's victims who are just like her. As he tries to manage all the zombies from Pacquita, but when she finds out the awful truth, they have to get out of the house before the zombies and their still-living body parts get to them first.The Good News: This is a really entertaining film. This is mostly known for how bloody and extremely graphic it is. One of the goriest scenes is when a party-goer has his entire intact rib-cage pulled, in its entirety, from his body. In addition to the guest who underwent sudden rib-cage removal, the many and varied demises include a woman having her guts pulled out, a man literally having his face lifted right off his skull, a woman having her throat bitten and ripped out, one guy who is stripped of flesh from the waist down and a woman who has a fist emerge from her mouth after being punched in the back of the head. Another scene has a zombie smashed up against a light fixture so hard, a light bulb is in its skull, causing the entire head to glow. There is an endless stream of decapitations and amputations, most coming from the utterly insane lawnmower sequence, where one person takes a lawnmower into a room bursting with zombies and walks through the crowd, spraying limbs, organs, blood, bones and body pieces in all directions, for what has to be several minutes as well. With just about every death containing blood splatter as well, there's no shortage of blood in this one, and a lot of this film's success is due to it. Even without the gore, the make-up effects are totally disgusting, with the initial transformation the mother undergoes a huge example. Over night, Mother's injury gets seriously infected, resulting in spurting-bloody-pus infected, her tongue is swollen, her face is getting scabby, and a gigantic wound on her arm is pulsing. When scrambling to her makeup table, she smears a makeup-brush across her face and a big flap of skin peels off. The addition of the Sumatran Rat Monkey isn't far behind. It is a beastly little thing, having the body of a monkey, albeit lacking any hair, and the head of a rat, again, with no hair. Huge black eyes and long jagged teeth complete its hideous appearance. It really could've been included more, as the appearance is quite shocking and can carry a film easily. Almost as impressive as the gore and make-up is the ingenuity. When a people get killed, they not only come back to life but their body parts can function on their own. When one loses their insides, they will attack someone else five minutes later completely independent of the host. That amounts to several great moments where only disembodied parts chase after victims. All throughout, it's also very apparent that the whole thing is being played for laughs. Cartoon-ish touches keep the grisly from becoming too much. In one scene, Lionel ends up running in place due to the slippery blood on the floor. Throughout the entire lawnmower scene and several others, a severed half-head gets kicked all over the bloody floor like a hockey puck. Another moment has one character who wipes his face with a cloth and smears green embalming fluid all over his face. The scene in the park is simply fall-down hilarious, due to the extreme nature taken in the events and the priest material is classic. These are all trumped, though, by the dinner scene. For example, the main character is having dinner with several zombies. One of them has their throat slit, so the pudding she is eating oozes out of the hole. The main character decides to pull her head back, dropping several spoons full of pudding down her esophagus. Naturally, the infamous custard scene comes next, in which Mum's wound spurts pus from beneath the bandage into the bowl of the President's husband, who, eyes closed in enjoyment, scoops it right up. Couple this together with a strong pace and nonstop action, it becomes all the more enjoyable.The Bad News: There isn't much of anything wrong. The biggest question is the blood-and-guts. There is so much gore on display here that after a while the sheer magnitude will either cause you to flee in disgust or begin to lose its impact. Also, because of the tone of the film, most of the violence, despite being ultra graphic, is still very much comedic in nature. This can be a problem to get through for some, who want the gore, but for some it will be hard to get past the film for it's gore. This, though, is the film's sole problem.The Final Verdict: While it's not surprising how gory this is, there isn't a lot to dislike in this one. This is one even the gore-hounds will be satiated at, and there's enough in here to allow even those not into that sort of style to have fun with this. Highly recommended to all kinds of horror fans, but mostly gore fans.Rated UR/NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence, some Language and Nudity",Dead Alive

58,Rabical-91,''Crainium blowout!'',8,27 March 2017,"Five years after Peter Jackson's blood splattering hit 'Bad Taste' churned the stomachs of cinema goers, the young director went even further down the gore route and came up with 'Braindead' ( known in North America as 'Dead Alive' ), set in 1950's New Zealand.It was disgusting to say the least. Not one moment goes by without gross, blood and gut letting violence going by. It was all about the life of a young mummy's boy whose life is turned upside down when his mother is transformed into a flesh hungry zombie. Lionel Cosgrove is a well mannered, well intentioned though dim witted and spineless young man who has not yet managed to break himself free from the apron strings of his malicious, conniving mother Vera.Eventually, Lionel strikes up a relationship with beautiful Spanish shopkeeper Paquita and one day takes her on a day out to the zoo where a hideously deformed creature known as a rat monkey is known to reside. Lionel soon discovers his mother is spying on him and Paquita when she stumbles against the cage containing the deadly animal which bites her.The venom from the bite causes Vera to mutate into a zombie. Eventually, Vera's appetite for human flesh spirals out of control and before long all of the city has become overrun by the undead.'Braindead' is certainly not one of the best comedy films around, it's not even great but it is fun, if sick and vile. The acting is nothing too special ( apart from Elizabeth Moody, who played Lionel's nasty mother ) but for a film like this that is probably to be expected. Timothy Balme, who played Lionel, more recently has appeared in the dreadful New Zealand drama 'The Almighty Johnsons'. Diana Peñalver, who played Paquita, I suspect was hired for her looks alone and not her acting ability.The funniest moments in the film included a slowly zombifying Vera trying to host a dinner party which ends in gory disaster, a zombie priest and zombie nurse having sex and giving birth to a baby zombie, a female zombie having her head impaled on an active light bulb thus alighting her head like a Halloween lantern and the zoo keeper announcing to Lionel and Paquita that the rat monkey creature came into existence after a plague of rats raped all the tree monkeys of Skull Island. Only the scene at the end where Lionel massacres the zombies with a lawn mower doesn't work. I personally found it horribly overdone.Whilst the special effects used for their time would have been pretty impressive, I suspect now they probably wouldn't stand the test of time. As I said previously, 'Braindead' may not be great, but it is still fun.",Dead Alive

60,IonicBreezeMachine,"I give it credit on its craft and style, but I was never enjoying the movie as much as I wanted",7,13 September 2020,"Peter Jackson's 1992 film Dead Alive a.k.a. Braindead is an over the top exercise in excess. The movie follows the supernatural shenanigans that befall the town of Wellington when a creature known as a rat monkey spawned from when ship rats raped the monkeys of Skull Island is brought to the local zoo with disastrous results. The movie follows Lionel a put upon and meek man who can't seem to get out from under his overbearing and domineering mother's thumb, Lionel's mom is bitten by the Rat Monkey and soon transforms into an ungodly abomination whose evil is spreading as Lionel attempts to keep her and the creatures she's spawn under control.Braindead has many, many elements at work. It's an homage to numerous other films including King Kong and Psycho, it's a love story, and it's an over the top gore fest with some of the best designed gross out and splatter effects ever produced on film. Which makes me sad to say I didn't like this movie that much.While there's nothing all that wrong with Braindead, I found I wasn't enjoying it as much as similar fare like Night of the Creeps, Return of the Living Dead, and the Evil Dead sequels. I think the overall issue I had with the movie was there wasn't all that much of a story stringing the set pieces together. There's a lot of creativity to be seen with the undead chaos that ensues including a zombie baby, living entrails, faceless dead, headless dead, bottomless dead, and topless dead just to name a few, but I never felt like there's was any comedic rhythm to the events I was watching unfold. When I look back upon movies like Living Dead or Evil Dead 2 there was buildup to the over the top gore scenes that gave set up and pay off that made them funny. In Braindead's case the first half of the movie feels like set up with ALL of the biggest gross out effects taking up the last act of the movie which is an impressive feat visually speaking with great details, but because all of this chaos is compressed into the last third of the movie it becomes repetitive after a while and I found myself losing engagement in the proceedings.Braindead is a movie that is worthy and well deserving of its cult following and I do recommend the movie to anyone who's a fan of the over the top spatter horror comedy sub genre. It's a clever movie, with well thought out comedy and amazing effects. I only wish I were able to enjoy it on the same level others do.",Dead Alive
61,mstomaso,Perhaps the best horror comedy of all time,8,3 March 2007,"Peter Jackson's gore-fest ""Dead Alive"" - AKA Braindead- is a very funny, very bloody film. The story is pretty simple, but includes some ingenious plot elements - such as a budding romance between two very likable characters (Balme and Penalver), a psychologically distressing relationship between Balme and his mother and well scripted dialog.Balme plays Lionel - a troubled, more or less housebound young man who has been forced to spend most of his time taking care of a domineering and psychologically damaging elderly mother. Penalver plays Paquita - his romantic destiny. Paquita is a charming young woman for whom English is (perhaps) a second language. Soon after they meet, Paquita notices some odd quirks in Lionel's behavior, and slowly begins to realize that there is something besides the usual male fear of commitment. Perhaps Lionel's cannibalistic zombie mother is to blame? Soon enough Balme is babysitting a whole family of living dead who he has to constantly inject with animal tranquilizers, and trying to fend off a despicable uncle who is trying to muscle in on his inheritance. Then the fun really starts. It's the Dead Alive Series with extra gore, infused with brilliant slapstick and just a pinch of Monty Python.Balme is amazing! - an excellent physical actor with great slapstick pacing and manic anxiety. And Penalver is delightfully pretty and sincere yet gives a nice campy performance. Dead Alive is one of the films in which Jackson began to blend detailed ecstatic and fantastic elements into his plots and cinematography - later culminating in the disturbing Heavenly Creatures and the spectacular LOTR trilogy. In Dead Alive, he finds his formula and makes it work without a tremendous budget. The film is well shot and grotesque, but remarkably amusing.",Dead Alive
62,ElijahCSkuggs,doesn't get any better..,10,9 October 2003,"Quite possibly the best horror movie of all time, Dead Alive (the unrated version)is bar none the epitome for zombie violence.  Peter Jackson is the man when it comes to making any type of movie, low budget-high budget, whatever.  There are so many spectacularly creative deaths in this movie, and scenes of pure blood splatter, that no other horror movie will inflict a severe gross out effect on you again.  I'm serious too, I saw this movie in '94, and I've still yet to see anything this awesome.  I've heard there are some pretty cool Japanese movies like ""Lai Wong"", and ""Versus"" was really good, though not as gross as ""DA"".  Of course, if you really need to see something off the charts, watch ""Urotsukidoji"".  It doesn't matter which one, I'm sure they're all nuts.

63,one9eighty,"No, this is not the one with the donkey and the chambermaid...",10,29 June 2020,"When Lionel Cosgrove takes his date Paquita to the zoo his over-brooding and over-doting mother is bitten by an extremely rare and poisonous Sumatran rat-monkey. The rare specimen was brought back from Skull Island (yes, the same island King-King is from) and legend has it that the monkey is hybrid birthed from when tree dwelling monkeys raped plague carrying rats. The bite turns Lionel's mum Vera into the walking dead, a contagious and highly disgusting puss filled zombie. This starts a chain of events which forces Lionel to grow up quickly, he has to become the man that stops caring for his undead mother, and instead learns to save the day from the undead and his awful 'family' and 'friends' who are only interested in any inheritance that might have been left, and parting at Lionel's expense.This film is one of my favourite films and stands at the summit of a visceral goretastic splatter and gross-out mountain that has made me the person I am today. It still stands as one of my favourate horror-comedies of all time. It's not just an absolute corker of a film, it pathed the way for how my cinematic sense would develop as I entered my teenage years. This didn't just tickle my senses, but the film became a platform that I was able to share with my father who has as an equally terrible sense of humour to me. Since then we have bonded over these types of films with great joy.Played by Timothy Balme, Lionel is a wonderful loser. The anybody zero who is an undoubtable underdog that must develop to come good in the end. Lionel's mother, Vera, played by Elizabeth Moody, is cringeworthily brilliant and elicits the kind of emotion that makes hate her and equally sorry for her, and feel sorry and uncomfortable for anyone she encounters. Likewise, Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) does a brilliant job of carrying that same emotion on after Vera's 'change'. I feel sorry for Lionel and his girlfriend Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Penalver) throughout as they try to survive the films climax and deal with the next problem which seems to eclipse the last problem. Equally I have to mention Stuart Devenie's kung-fu action priest character - Father Jon McGruder, who I have quoted throughout my teenage years - brilliant!It is difficult to believe that this ground-breaking comedy-horror was directed by Peter Jackson years before he went on to make films about Hobbits and Wizards. This is as far away from a multi-million-dollar budget, star studded Hollywood film as it gets. This low budget masterclass isn't a B or C movie, this created a whole new branding of a Z-Movie.Have you ever seen zombies have sex? Have you seen abomination of that same zombie sexual encounter go rogue? Have you ever wondered how to rid a house of a party of unwanted zombies? Have you ever seen a Sumatran rat-monkey? If you want answer to those questions, and more then get this film on and enjoy!It's funny, it's sick, it's disgusting. There is character development, a great plot, a fantastic delivery. Critically awful, but with a massive cult approval, ""Braindead"" (or ""Dead Alive"" in some countries) is an absolutely brilliant film and couldn't be better if it tried. While Jackson's LOTR and Hobbit films are highly regarded in Hollywood it is this film I could watch on repeat weekly rather than those. This is a ground-breaking, one of kind film, that proves that that over the top isn't enough over the top enough, that gallons of blood is too little, that you can laugh at dismemberment, and that you can make a fantastic film without Hollywood's CGI heavy effects. 28 years later, in 2020 this film STILL holds the record for most fake blood used in a film - 300 bloody litres (Take that ""Saw IV"", ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""Hostel: Part II"", ""Piranha 3D"", ""Martyrs"", ""The Cabin in the Woods"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Carrie"", and ""House of 1000 Corpses""). Realising this fact bumps my rating from a 9 out of 10 to a solid 10/10 - I know it may not be to everyone's tastes, but this is my review and this film is right on the money for my sick tastes.Stand back boy, this calls for divine intervention.... I kick arse for the Lord!",Dead Alive
64,Mister-6,Yay!,10,13 February 2002,"Bow down, pay homage and rejoice, ye fans of truly gory horror: ""Braindead"" is here!I caught this at a friends' Halloween party and spent most of the evening watching entranced as zombies, rat monkeys, Shaolin-Catholic priests, intestines and lawnmowers all share screen time.  Every minute of its running time, in the back of my mind, I was just subliminally shouting ""yay"" at the top of my lungs, overjoyed at every grotesque/hilarious moment that transpired.  No plot description is necessary here; this is a movie that can only be experienced first-hand with friends and family (and barf bags) close at hand.If you have not seen ""Braindead"" and think you've seen it all, you MUST catch this one!  As funny as ""Evil Dead 2"" yet almost blasphemously profane, therefore all the funnier!  Monstrous zombified mothers (yay!), partially decapitated nurses (yay!), pus-filled soup (yay!), zombified babies beaten from pillar to post (yay!) and enough stage blood to fill two Olympic-size swimming pools (yay!) will give the strong-stomached among you jollies to last for months.  I sure did the trick for me.Director/co-writer Jackson went on to bigger things, to be sure, but will he ever regain the inspiration he attained here?  Probably not, but how would he mix Hobbits and killer intestines (yay!)?Ten, no: eleven...no: TWELVE stars for ""Braindead"" (ten for the movie, two for the overall feeling you'll have days after in remembering how zombies party).YAY!",Dead Alive
65,KnightsofNi11,Satisfies anyone's gore fetish,7,26 September 2011,"Before he made the hit Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson was a small budget director from New Zealand who just sat around making the movies he wanted to make, no matter how weird, gross, scary, or silly they were. Dead Alive was his final New Zealand based project before he made The Frighteners with Universal Pictures and then of course the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Dead Alive is a zombie film about a man named Lionel whose mum is bitten by a Sumerian rat monkey. Lionel's mother falls gravely ill and then starts transforming into an undead nightmare that attacks and bites other people, spreading the infection. Lionel, being a timid mama's boy, can't bring himself to kill his own mother, despite the fact that she is already undead, and so he tries to cover up his zombie problem as it grows worse and worse. This is one of the more offbeat zombie films you'll see as it strangely combines humor and horror and makes sight gags out of some of the most grotesque, disgusting, and vomit inducing blood and gore ever seen in film. I would actually feel safe calling this the goriest film ever made.From the get go it is easy to tell what a small budget film this is and how it isn't setting out to be anything huge or revolutionary. This is Peter Jackson having fun and making the goriest film he can make, but in an ironically tongue-in-cheek manner. The film is really dumb, very sloppy, and incredibly silly, and it knows these things. It has the simplest of stories and the most basic of characters, bu,t for all intensive purposes, these aspects work. The film doesn't get bogged down with useless character relationships or convoluted subplots. It is very streamlined and very basic so that at the core of the film you simply have a really fun zombie flick.And that is what you will remember about Dead Alive, the zombie part. This film pulls out all the stops and comes up with every way imaginable to kill a zombie. We see the bloody effectiveness of everything from a blender, to a light bulb, to a lawnmower. Some characters even insist on using martial arts to fight off the undead hoards and, like everything else, it works and it makes a terrible mess, which is just what we're looking for. This is film is made solely to entertain. It delivers more zombie action than we could have asked for and the last half hour of the film is a never ending man versus zombie bloodbath which remains consistently exciting and never gets repetitive. As simplistic as Dead Alive is, it is actually a rather impressive film.Dead Alive is a must see for fans of zombie films as long as you don't expect anything serious. It's also recommended for Peter Jackson fans who want to get a taste of the director before he hit his greatest achievement via Lord of the Rings. This is an unbelievably fun film that sticks out despite all of its stupidity, simplicity, and utter silliness. It's a film that aims to entertain and disgust simultaneously, and it absolutely pulled that off.",Dead Alive
66,jluis1984,Insane fun!,9,3 January 2006,"Director Peter Jackson, now a worldwide known celebrity thanks to his wonderful ""Lord of the Rings"", created an early masterpiece with this little gem filled with the most insane comedy ever. ""Braindead"" or ""Dead Alive"", is definitely not a horror film in the classic way, instead of scare the audience, it takes to the limit all what was accomplished by Sam Raimi almost 10 years before in his bizarre mixture of horror and sick slapstick comedy, ""Evil Dead"" and its sequel ""Evil Dead 2"".Set in 1957 in New Zealand, ""Braindead"" tells the story of Lionel Cosgrove (wonderful Timothy Balme), a young man who has spent his life under the oppressive control of his mother Vera (Elizabeth Moody). One day, he meets Paquita (Diana Peñalver), who thinks Lionel is her one true love, and ends up having a date with her at the Zoo. His mother follows them but she is accidentally bitten by the mysterious Sumatran Rat Monkey. Hell's broke loose when the bite turns her into a zombie and Lionel's life won't be the same again! The movie, as most reviews have pointed out, is filled with the most grotesque scenes I've ever seen, and yet, it is still a comedy. A romantic comedy for those with strong stomach, since despite its goofy humor the movie has all a horror fan would desire: pus, ooze, gore and blood at 5 gallons per second.The make-up and the SFX are remarkably outstanding, the movie presents things that are quite imaginative and it is amazing how all this was accomplished with a low budget.Jackson's direction is what makes this movie to be different. Many movies have over-the-top comic-book violence, but Jackson, along writers Stephen Sinclair and Fran Walsh, have created a story that really traps the audience. The comedic tone is very well handled and there is no time where the movie gets tiresome or boring. It actually feels as a roller-coaster.The cast, most of them newcomers, does a great job with the script, and many of the performances are classic by these days. Timothy Balme is great as the unlikely hero of the story, and beautiful Diana Peñalver is a fitting romantic interest, but definitely Ian Watkin and Stuart Devenie steal the show; Watkin, as the despicable uncle trying to get Lionel's money, and Devenie, in his small but very memorable scenes as the Priest of the small New Zealand town that gets invaded by zombies.Even with all this great stuff, I must say that this movie may not be for everyone, as many of its scenes could be labeled as gross, sick or plain disgusting. However, for those interested in a not so serious horror film with a big dose of black humor and intestines, this movie will be like heaven. 9/10. A Cult classic",Dead Alive
67,The_Movie_Cat,"""That's my mother you're p***ing on!""",3,8 October 2000,"And that's probably one of the least offensive lines. Braindead is a spoof of zombie/slasher thrillers, with a bit of Hitchcock thrown in. The fact that most of these movies were tongue-in-cheek in the first place means that the film's makers were probably out more for derision of their source material, rather than affectionate homage.Yet the only real agenda Braindead has is to shock and repulse with bad-taste humour. This is fine in itself, bad taste can be very amusing, and the high rating this movie gets  means a lot of people did find it very funny.  So maybe it's just me. I must admit, I'm not a fan of Antipodean ""humour"", an oxymoron if ever there was one. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was a good effort, but other movies, such as the OTT Strictly Ballroom, or sitcoms, such as the abysmal Let The Blood Run Free, leave me cold. They always seem to miss their targets in a volley of ham acting and overstated camp.Braindead continues this great tradition; any level of wit eked out of it by going too far. How far is too far? Well, certainly, a film going right to the limits of what is considered good taste can be a lucrative endeavour - as the recent run of gross-out movies from Hollywood have proven. So if your idea of a good joke is seeing a mutant baby held in place via a nail through it's umbilical cord, or a character who exclaims ""some of my best friends are paedophiles"" then you'll have what is known in the dumbo trade as a ""laugh riot"".Timothy Balme is quite effective as the lead, Lionel Cosgrove, and Diana Peñalver does well as his love interest. Ian Watkin is excruciatingly unfunny as Uncle Les,  and the only genuinely funny actor is Tony Hiles as the all-too-brief monkey blood-dripping zookeeper. A karate-kicking vicar (""I kick ass for the Lord!"") perfectly illustrates how gratingly misjudged and unsophisticated the humour is. Surprisingly, given the pace and subject matter, the film is also quite tedious.On the positive side (and there's little!) the production and design is well done, the only inspired scene - yes, the lawnmower - being particularly well put-together. Though this scene is perhaps unfairly cited as the goriest of the movie, whereas all the scenes involving the eating of custard are more likely to make you queasy.However, fans of Lord of the Rings may panic when it's revealed that the man behind all this is also the scheduled writer/director for that particular trilogy. Please don't be fooled with arguments that this horror film ""subverts the basic laws of the genre"" or that it's a ""Freudian critique"". Arguments like that crop up all the time to justify bad movies. If this is your idea of humour, then good luck to you. Personally I found it absolutely abysmal.",Dead Alive
68,Superunknovvn,"Sweet Jesus, what a riot!",6,22 April 2003,"I didn't care much for the first, rather boring half of this movie. The second half, however, is really a blast. Unbelievable, how much love Peter Jackson put into the making of a movie that was much likely to never pay back its costs (much like one of his previous films ""Bad Taste""). With a budget of only 3m$ and no digital special effects I imagine this to be harder to make than the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. Jackson did it, however, and he realized this crazy screenplay with an incredible lot of creativity. Bravo!",Dead Alive
69,tomimt,Something's wrong about mommy,8,13 February 2006,"There are some definitely unique features in Peter Jackson's Braindead. Unique features for a zombie film that is. Or to think it again, those features are pretty unique when you place them against any genre.As some of you might know, Braindead is the second feature film made by Peter Jackson, who now has much larger audience with his feature adaptations of Lord Of The Rings and King Kong. Just don't get this film expecting you'll see something similar. Because you don't. Not in that scale anyway.The humor is extremely dark in the film, that's why it's not a surprise, that the film has been casted as one of the most goriest films ever made. And that is not an understatement: blood, guts, chopped limbs and heads all fly all across the room in the final showdown, where Lionel (Timothy Balme) finally starts to get rid of his zombie problem.A Sumatran rat monkey. There is something dreadfully wrong with that animal. In fact, when it's taken into a zoo in Wellington it immediately begins to show some bad temper. Finally it bits the hand of Lionels mum (Elizabeth Moody) and things start to go in really bad direction. Lionels fresh relationship with beautiful Paquita (Diana Peñalver) seems to end before it even starts. And mum seems to have acquired taste for human flesh. Oh bugger.The film techniques Jackson uses in the film are pretty similar, but more developed, thanks to bigger budget and better equipment than he had during Bad Taste, his another gore infested zombie flick. Script is as insane and ridiculous than it was in the previous film, but there are some more elements in it, besides cheap splatter, like the love story of Lionel and Paquita and the whole thing with jealous obsessions Lionels mother has towards his son.Braindead is probably one of the best zombie films I've ever seen. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which has tripped over more than one flick. As I said, the film has some pretty gross effects and it really doesn't fit for children or people who might get upset with this kind of imaginary. but if it's dark comedy you're after, then this might be just the thing for you.",Dead Alive

TRASH EVERY OTHER HORROR MOVIE AWAY!!! THIS IS THE REAL THING!!! NO HOLDS BARRED!!! NO QUESTIONS!!! NO DISCUSSIONS!!! ZIP! ZILCH! ZERO! END OF STORY!............................Sounds exciting, eh? Well, before anybody rates this one a perfect ""10"", let me remind all of you that this atrocity in gut spilling and bloodbathing is still not the kind of breakthrough you're expecting! Sorry, but DEAD ALIVE is plain and simple enough to describe as a copycat of past splatter films. Like Troma's and H.G. Lewis' movies, it has some twisted humor to go along with the spare parts, which is an acceptable combination. The only difference is that Peter Jackson spent tons of hard-earned cash from BAD TASTE and MEET THE FEEBLES in making the ultimate gory movie look like a big budget production from Hollywood. In other words, it compares well to a fatty triple-deckered cheeseburger filled with large sums of ketchup, mayo, and grease! The gore may be fun to watch by some, but it's overused way too often to make it very mindless, which is normal for splatter junkies. A sicko movie can't be without any positive qualities, though. Visuals are a giant improvement over BAD TASTE and is sillier. It has some original moments like the indestructible toddler, graveyard chop-socky, and the lawnmower killing scene, which is the SICKEST on celluloid! DEAD ALIVE ain't perfect, and some will be thinking after reading my controversial review that it sucks. It's better than average, but it's not truly outstanding, either.",Dead Alive

I don't understand why texas chainsaw massacre part 2 is bashed by a lot of people,and movies like dead alive,and evil dead II are praised. In my opinion texas chainsaw massacre part 2 is real laughs with lots of gore.

I'm not saying their bad movies. On the contrary. Their just not my cup of tea. Peter's third pic here, he couldn't of got it better. With this one, he doesn't make you forget what he's capable of. That first schlock winner, the dreaded Bad Taste, followed by that bizarre, puppet borderline porn flick, Meet The Feebles, I loved. I hated The Frighteners, although I never saw Heavenly Creatures which was considered his best. This one, that hit the video shelves, two years after it's cinema release in Adelaide, he's outdone himself. He's just got better here. We have a simple and cute little plot, which paves the way for a lot of disgusting and despicably delightful gore. The last thirty minutes, is a constant full on horror show. A mama's boy, a nicey nicey type, meets a new town beauty, falls in love. The three go out. The mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat monkey. She comes back to life, an enraged zombie, devouring any human or animal, and we know what happens from here. So just sit back, and be horribly disgusted, while entertained by what follows, cause if you're a horror geek, and like it full bore, you're gonna love Braindead.

It is every horror fanatics dream to witness the most extreme carnage ever! I didn't even realise you could fit so much gore into a film, and let's not forget this is the man who did Oscar winning classics like ""Lord Of The Rings"" and ""King Kong"" well Mr. Jackson this is up there with them (I haven't seen ""Lord Of The Rings"" though).You need a funny bone to actually enjoy this though. If you're a film snob, don't even bother with this because critically this is dire! But, if you're lucky enough to just ride with it, you will find the most entertaining film ever made. I was howling with laughter throughout, with the OTT acting and blood. The dinner table scene and park scene are just back breakingly hilarious! Then the last half hour begins with just legendary gore amounts, blood floods the room like ""The Shining"" and with the iconic ""lawn mower scene"" it would get any horror fan excited. You might think that continuous killing for 30 minutes would be a bit dull but it's not at all! The effects and kills are so inventive adding to the outrageous fun this film possesses. And then the ending comes out of the blue, no one knows why but no one cares either because its so much fun to watch.Its bizarre gory madness that you have to see to believe. Unfortunately there is no in the middle. Either you find this one of the best films ever made or one of the worst films ever made.

Ever since his father died saving him during a swimming accident Lionel has been taking care of his mother. But unfortunately his mother must have come from the same parenting class as Norman Bates' mother since she is as manipulative and smothering. But things seem to be on the up and up for him when he starts a romance with a local shop owner's daughter. But a date to the zoo takes a turn for the worse when Lionel's overprotective mum follows him and manages to get bitten by a ""rat monkey"", a particularly nasty creature whose bite is killerliterally. The bite turns his mum into a zombie and each one she bites turns as well. Pretty soon poor Lionel is living in the house of the dead and fighting off a lecherous uncle scheming to grab the estate.Peter Jackson (of Lord of the Rings fame) once again proves he is more than able to give us the gory goods and make us laugh the entire time. This insanely entertaining flick has buckets and buckets of blood and gore, probably one of the (if not THE) bloodiest around. For a film with a miniscule budget (approximately $3 million) he makes every penny count and turns out a very nice looking film. The comedy is pure slapstick and at times dark as pitch.

It's a movie that's not afraid to take a dive into some deliciously over-the-top thrills, all the while keeping the scares and excitement high! Even more effective are the wall to wall gore FX that this film takes full advantage of. To say that Dead Alive is not for the squeamish is a big understatement!

It's a rare film that's constantly having the audience to make a decision on whether to scream or laugh.

Peter Jackson, a genius of comedy-horror in his early days, hit his horror peak with this film. Simultaneously gut-wrenching and hilarious, the film displays some of the most creative and over-the-top gore ever put on film. From detached ears and pus-filled custard to meat cleaver and lawnmower massacres, 'Dead-Alive' is sure to please even the pickiest of gorehounds. The one problem I tend to have with splatter films is that they'll often sacrifice the things I look for in a film that actually make it quality: direction, acting, writing, story, etc. Luckily, Peter Jackson's gorefests actually display his talent alongside the puddles of blood and piles of severed limbs. Unlike most 'brainless' splatterfests, this film really isn't brainless at all (braindead, maybe). . . it doesn't simply throw in things for the sake of throwing things in. There was almost always a reason behind everything beyond just creating opportunities for more gore and that, for some reason, was a huge plus for me.

This is one of my favourite movies (in my top 150) as from a disturbingly young age, i've been a gore and zombie movie fan, and this definitely rates as one of the goriest films ever. Braindead, after Jackson's previous two low budget efforts, is remarkable in 2 ways: firstly, that it keeps the gore and stomach churning qualities of Bad Taste and Meet the Feebles, which can be seen to a smaller extent in his groundbreaking LOTR trilogy, but raise them to unbelievable levels. Secondly because, unlike his previous films, this one shows some semblance of emotions other than fear and disgust as we feel some sort of sympathy towards the main 2 characters. this relationship would feature in all his following films to date, such as Heavenly Creatures. But this movie does not try to be anything other than fun; gory, bloody, clever, funny fun.from the opening scene you know this is going to be a blood spattered mess as a man is quickly chopped limb from limb because he carries the disease which zombifies. and it does not disappoint, as every body part you can think of is cut off or gobbled up, lakes of intestines flow like lakes of blood, one zombie shoves a spoon through his own head in a failed attempt to eat in a more dignifies way. a zombie baby is kicked joyfully around a public park, and a lawn mower is used in a lovely, cleansing manner.

I don't know why I thought this was funny; that says things about me I'd rather not know.  But there are a lot of people who can see the humor in amongst the gore and to them I can recommend this.If you don't like gross-out movies (for example, if you think ""Something About Mary"" was too gross) then you must promise me that you will stay the hell away from ""Braindead"".

90,jamiedarlow-37510,Really worth seeing if you have the stomach for gross-out bloodiness!,10,16 February 2020,"This is one of the most ridiculously insane films out there and I think that's why it stands the test of time and has become a cult classic. Before The Lords Of The Rings trilogy, before the epic remake of King Kong, Peter Jackson made a name for himself in comedy-horror particularly for being a master of directing pure splatter! The first half of the film is just pretty strange to say the very least and balances between being a very dark and offbeat romantic comedy to bombastic creature and body horror. It's the story of Lionel (Timothy Balme) who is very much under the thumb of his overbearing mother (Elisabeth Moody) and so much so that it is affecting a sparkling romance with Paquita (Diana Penalver) a woman who becomes enchanted by Lionel through a suggestion made by fortune telling. The mother follows the couple and jealously spies on them, as a result of which she gets bitten by a rat-monkey from Sumatra. And that's just the beginning! What follows is a chaotic descent into gory hell that has to be seen to be believed that this film was made, and thank goodness for that! The practical creature and gore effects by Richard Taylor and his team are astounding; making for a much more visceral watch than it would be if it was cgi. It features one of the most hilarious scenes I think I've ever seen ('I kick arse for the LORD!!!!') the biggest bloodbath you're ever likely to see on celluloid and some genuinely disgusting moments that you won't know whether to laugh or turn away from. The acting is over the top for the most part as it needs to be but also surprisingly sweet from Lionel and Paquita who make for a pretty cool screen couple in the end. Such a damn fun and oddly cathartic experience with the knowledge that something this passionately silly exists! Plus pretty inspiring considering it's low budget and they made something this memorable and entertaining",Dead Alive

It's here the rat-monkey is captured and hauled away to civilization, but not before a man is bit and subsequently chopped into pieces. Our pathetic mama's boy of a main character sees his overbearing and downright horrible mother get chomped on by the rat-monkey at the zoo and takes her home to where she will wreck havoc as a zombie. The tone is basically slapstick and despite what could be the most bloodletting ever in a film, Jackson keeps his material comedic. The last act of the film is gleefully ridiculous as a giant uninvited party at our lead Lionel's home becomes a show stopping display of gore and off the wall manic filmmaking.

It's no doubt that after the huge success of ""Lord Of The Rings"" (2001 - 2003), Mr. Jackson's filmography would be unearthed. Yet I don't think anyone would have quite expected this.While being without a doubt one of the most sick twisted messes of a movie ever made, I have to say that the performances and set pieces are really grounded in the cartoon atmosphere the movie has created. It's really hard to believe Peter Jackson made such a hellish bloodbath, and yet still kept it vaguely entertaining throughout. It has aged awfully but the macabre is off the charts, even after hearing that the recent ""Evil Dead"" remake (2013) topped this movies record for most fake blood used in a motion picture.Blood doesn't necessarily mean better, and every body part you can think of goes flying somewhere into something or someone. I cannot begin to write down what doesn't get mutilated, so much so that theatres supplied vomit bags.Final Verdict: It is the GOREIST movie ever made in the English language I have seen so far, and will anything ever top it? I bloody hope not. I watched it once, I own it and I'm scared to play it again (And I've seen 2008's ""Tokyo Gore Police"", and the works of Takashi Miike). 7/10.

However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when Ola' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing (or second, or third...) of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based drama Heavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort.

96,ragingbull_2005,Gross fest which is plain disgusting and unfunny,4,24 December 2012,"I first saw Dead Alive aka Brain Dead nearly nine years ago. I did not know Peter Jackson then, had no clue about the Lord of The Rings movies he had made. I brought this to show to my friends in engineering college on the recommendation of the CD shop owner who said that this was a terrific movie, very scary and full of thrills. Back then I had cursed him and his family members a lot after viewing the film. I had to stop the screening after 45 minutes as almost all the people had left. That was the only screening I was allowed to do during under graduation. I decided to see this again as I wanted to be through with Jackson's filmography as a director before watching The Hobbit. So I got a blue ray print and was very excited because of the great reviews and rating that this enjoys on various sites. This is the story of a rat monkey from Sumatra who bites people and infects them, turning them into zombies with flesh eating urges. I could watch this till the hour mark and then had to shut it down again. The bad special effects, the amateurish acting, the weird camera angles and the 'different' direction might be cup of tea for his legions of fan boys but they made for a very jarring movie watching experience. I understood that the movie is deliberately over the top like Evil Dead but it could not grip me at all. A few scenes were pretty hilarious but the overall sense remains the same that I could have done without watching this. 2 out of 5 for Jackson's Dead Alive. If being grossed out is what you like you will enjoy this tremendously. For others, this is a mandatory skip.",Dead Alive

This film is so unbelievably repulsive and violent, it losses its shock value, and becomes over-the-top and cheesy.  Not a great horror film, but it succeeds as a comedy.  Way too much for most I am sure, but folks who don't mind seeing killer intestines, this is your cup of tea.Who would have thunk that this is the same guy who would go on to make the Lord of the Rings movies?",Dead Alive
98,Tromafreak,Wholesome Family Entertinment Part 7: Damn Fine Custard,10,8 August 2009,"It's like this, Braindead aka Dead Alive is, and will probably always be the goriest movie in existence. Whatever film is the second goriest can't even be compared to the jaw-dropping brilliance, the completely insane amounts of gore that has been brought forth by the Lord Of The Rings guy. Seriously, isn't that weird? Does Peter Jackson, the guy that polluted theaters with that awful, evil trilogy really deserve this kind of honor? To be perfectly honest, I'm not really OK with it, I kind of wish someone would dethrone this guy as the goriest filmmaker, but like I said, it just ain't happenin'.Not quite your typical Living-dead pattern, but close enough. Set in 1950's New Zealand. About a mama's boy named Lionel, his controlling mum Vera, his love-interest, Paquita, and that rascal, the Rat-Monkey that brings Hell down on everyone. One day, Lionel takes Paquita the love-interest to the Zoo, Vera the mum follows them, and while snooping, gets bitten by the disease-carrying Rat-Monkey. Lionel ditches poor Paquita, takes mum home, takes care of mum till mum dies, and naturally, continues doing so after mum comes back. Vera the mum is now Vera the Zombie, completely out of control and killing and infecting anyone in arms reach. Lionel pretty much takes in anyone who's been infected and takes care of them like they're apart of the family, not a bright lad, I take it. Shooting them all in the head most likely would have solved everything. Lionel sure is lucky that Paquita gave him that star-moon thing, whatever the hell that means.If there is in fact something that hasn't been said about Dead Alive, it's this. Aside from the standard-setting gore, this is one hell of a well-made quality film, at times, a love story, a film that, to me, never gets old, and a film that deserves more than that crummy little Lions Gate DVD release, I want audio commentary (Joe Bob Briggs), I want 2 discs, I want extras. Where are you when we need you, Shriek Show?For every decade, there has been at least 2 or 3 cult classics that manage to grow out of the cult following and get at least some of the recognition it deserves. The 60's had Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs, the 70's had Pink Flamingo's and Faces Of Death, and of course The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, everyone knows The Toxic Avenger ruled the 80's, and finally, the 90's (the dark ages), by now, B-entertainment is pretty irrelevant, so we're talking slim pickin's, but there's always The Doom Generation and Tromeo & Juliet, and yeah, Dead Alive. For proof that this Peter Jackson guy was not a one-hit wonder, check out Bad Taste, which is more low-budget. for something way too long and waaaaay too overrated, check out The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, especially if you're a child. And for something beyond comprehension, there's always Meet The Feebles. Although, Dead Alive is King, there have since been a few that almost come close to the Jackson-level of gore, such as Leif Jonker's Darkness, Premutos, and Bone Sickness, yet, nothing will probably ever dethrone the one brought to you by the Lord Of The Rings guy. So, never mind Romero, never mind Raimi... just never mind. If you've seen Dead Alive, you know what's up. Passionately recommended to Gorehounds everywhere. 10/10",Dead Alive
99,Jacques98,Just a little stale . . .,4,10 September 2008,"The sub-genre of bloody Saturday morning cartoons has come a long way over the years, and it's hard to Braindead was the granddaddy of them all. Maybe that is why it seems so stale when the gore starts. It's hard not to compare it to superior movies like The Machine Girl and Kill Bill from the same sub-genre, despite the fact it's older. I could be the only one who feels that way, but after seeing so many similar movies first that were better, it's hard to be positive in this review.I know no one else is going to share my opinion here, but I really loved this movie until the gore startedthen it just got bland and seen-this-before. On a technical level, as far as amount, this is most likely the goriest movie ever made. That doesn't mean it's effective, however. The gore effects have not aged well and though the gore is terribly unrealistic or anything, but I was just unimpressed with the level of actual blood. It seemed there was a lot of bloodied skin and torn out rib cages, but hardly any blood on the floor or on anything else except in random scenes where blood was a plot point. That's why I'm hard-pressed to call this the goriest movie ever because I've certainly seen more blood on screen than this in Inside and seen more severed limbs in Kill Bill. So maybe it's just the audacity that tricks us into thinking it's the goriest movie of all time, because I'm starting to doubt it is.Though none of this makes the film bad. It isn't bad. For what it tried to do, it did. The lawnmower scene was nicely done. There were quite a few genuinely funny scenes, and I'm not sure the last time a gore movie (I almost said horror movie, but this really isn't one) had me laughing as hard as Braindead did. The casting and acting were absolutely perfect for the type of movie it was. It reminded me a lot of a bloody episode of Wallace and Gromit, for whatever reason.I just can't give this a perfect rating. I guess I've seen so many modern movies like this before I saw Braindead, it just looks slightly bland and overdone. I just can't say it holds up well to movies like The Evil Dead, even though it has more gore. I think there are some movies that are meant for a certain generation, and a lot of people in the next generation won't understand it. Maybe that's what Braindead is. It was made before horror-comedy really caught on in a major way, but after you've seen all the others this just seems repetitiveat least to me. Make up your own mind. Any and every horror fan needs to see this movie. Don't let my negative comments discourage you from that.5/10",Dead Alive
100,geminiredblue,A Gosh Darn Fine Zombie Movie!,8,18 April 2011,"What can I possibly add to the reviews that haven't already talked about Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE (AKA BRAINDEAD)? Before Peter Jackson became the mega-director who made the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, he was already making a name for himself as a wild and woolly filmmaker from New Zealand! Soon after making several forgettable movies (BAD TASTE, any one?) he came out with what many believe is the creme-de-la-creme (no pun intended) of zombie comedies (or zomedies for short.) Set in New Zealand during the sickeningly-sweet 50s, this movie follows Lionel, our hapless, mum-dominated hero. In many ways, it's a standard boy-meets-girl story: Boy-meets-girl, boy's mum gets bitten by rare rat monkey, boy's mum turns into a raging zombie, raging zombie mum soon infects others, boy must rescue girl from zombie hordes, etc. What set this movie apart at the time, and still today, are the imaginative gore and special effects that still have me wowed to this day. And it still leaves me rolling in the aisles, provided I don't get sickened first! Yucks and chuckles are what this movie does well. If Peter Jackson was out to set some sort of bloodiest movie record, he certainly achieved it! Everything but the kitchen sink is used... or is it?

This movie is brilliant, the tone Peter Jackson went for is absolutely perfect. A dazzling mixture of comedy and gore. Blood-spattered, gruesome, charming fun! Jackson certainly knew what he was doing, as this movie could satisfy even the most die-hard fans of B movies, specially gory ones. Even though you find it nauseating and stomach-churning you can't look away, because you sort of look in awe. Sounds a bit weird, but that's how good this movie is!Elizabeth Moody is the highlight, acting-wise for me. Her character is everything this movie needs, this plot needs and the grisly violent action
needs. I wonder how much fake blood did they use in this movie, probably gallons. Highly entertaining film, I can easily go from this to watch any ""Lord of the Rings"" film and feel bedazzled by thinking this same guy did both masterpieces in such different genres and tones.",Dead Alive
102,TheRedDeath30,"Yes, It's Bloody Disgusting but Also Full of Bad Humor",8,18 January 2015,"My ""relationship"" with this movie is an odd one. Some movies you fall more in love with each time you see it. Some movies cause you to hate it more with each viewing. This movie fluctuates for me. Maybe it's the mood I'm in, but mostly I think it has to do with what I'm trying to ""get out of the viewing experience"" when I see this movie.Am I looking for a bloody disgusting good time? Then, this is the movie for me on that night. I was a little disappointed my first time seeing this for most of the movie's run time. It has this legendary status as the bloodiest movie of all time, so naturally we go in expecting a full-on splashfest, but most of that comes during the finale. That is not to say that the movie doesn't have it's gross out moments in the first half, at all. It starts setting a bar early and continues to top it as the movie goes along, but it's not until that final, gore-drenched finale that the movie really earns its' rep, but once it does, it is glorious indeed. It's one of the few movies that have ever made my horrorhound wife cringe a little in disgust.With repeated viewings, though, that initial glee of seeing so much gore on screen tends to diminish as you're more familiar with the territory. Now we start to examine the backbone of the movie more and it's a little hard for me to swallow sometimes. I'm also not a big fan of BAD TASTE, another Jackson indie flick that I find has an over- hyped reputation. To me, the humor is just stupid. Maybe it's a cultural divide, maybe it's just me. Every time the movie goes for a laugh I find myself rolling my eyes. Then, there's the bad Raimi playdough style effects that also cheapen the movie. Some horror fans find an affinity for those low budget effects, but they just look bad to me.What is my final opinion of the movie, then? I guess I'm not entirely sure. I think it's a fun movie that's an absolute essential for the gorehound in search of a bloody movie and it holds a lot of appeal there, but just be prepared for a cheesy romance story with some bad effects and some even worse Kiwi humor.",Dead Alive
103,Maleplatypus,It's so awful that it might be considered good,3,9 September 2011,"The first thing that came to mind after watching this movie is Sam Raimi (Evil Dead series). Peter Jackson obviously tried to pay a homage to the master, copying his directing technique. Later on someone gave Mr. Jackson the money, and then came King Kong (which was actually good) and epic Lord of the Rings (which could be far better in someone else's hands). This movie also reminded me of Ed Wood and his enthusiasm for trash. By all means (especially acting and directing), this movie is awful. It's also occasionally funny, has a plot and screams for a remake (with a considerably larger budget, but probably the same director), meaning second chance. That way it probably won't look as an exam project on the movie academy, made by some almost-dropout students. It's worth a look, though. But just once.",Dead Alive

Several years ago when I heard that Peter Jackson, who directed this film, was also set to film the Rings Trilogy, I was very pessimistic--how could the wild, graveyard humor of Dead-Alive be restrained for the Rings? That Peter Jackson could do both so admirably is a tribute to his talent.What I find ironic is that Mother, who is bitten by an infected monkey, was more of a monster BEFORE she died. This horror movie is marvelously done as a macabre farce, and I can hardly think of an equal accomplishment on film. It's the reverse, mirror-image of Night of The Living Dead. The Living Dead drew its horror from relentless zombies trying to get IN, whereas this film draws its laughs from the protagonist trying to keep the zombies from getting OUT.There's not a serious moment in this film, and the lawnmower finale has become legendary, if not yet mythic. There is gore galore, but it is farcical rather than serious. I love this film, and I can hardly think of any film that has made me laugh longer or harder.",Dead Alive

It was so over the top with gore and filled with stupid humor that I almost didn't recommend it. But after watching it I saw that it was intentionally created with this type of humor in mind. Peter Jackson (yeah that Lord of The Rings guy)went above and beyond just a horror film and made one of the most hilarious gore comedy's of all time.Lionel,(Timothy Balme) an innocent young man, has to take care of his domineering mother after she is bitten by the infamous Sumatran rat monkey. After her death she comes back and starts eating people, infecting them and turning them into what she has become, a zombie that craves human flesh and blood. Like herself, these new zombies are able to infect other people that they dine on, and soon Lionel finds the task of trying to keep them all under lock and key in the basement impossible.This movie was way over the top in humor and gore. The gore becomes more outrageous as the movie goes on, and I found myself laughing hysterically at the special effects and the gruesome scenes. This is not a horror film per-say, it is more like a gruesome comedy which has more gross out scenes than any other movie I've ever seen. The movie includes a Kung Fu priest and even a baby zombie monster which was conceived by two zombies having sex. It all culminates into one of the weirdest endings of all time involving a lawnmower and a monstrous zombie.This movie is just to funny to be taken as a true horror film. It is definitely the goriest film I've ever seen, but I was to busy laughing to really be frightened by everything. But I can see why some people might vomit when seeing this film.

Jackson must have seen this film, and thought 'I can top this in gore and Oedipal comedy.' And ""Dead Alive"" (or ""Braindead"" in many parts of the world) was born.The film is neither for the faint of heart, nor for those who cannot enjoy a half hour long dismemberment sequence as a choreography of blades, bodies, blenders and blood. Think of it as the zombie equivalent of the space docking scene in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""The film gets right to it: an animal collector is hunted by an indigenous tribe through ravines (also used for the City of the Dead in LOTR by Jackson, talking about early location scouting). He is bitten by a rat-monkey that turns anyone into a zombie. His crew, who know the deal, throw him to the ground. His arm shows a mark. They hack off the arm. His other arm shows a mark. They hack of the other arm. His face shows a mark. They...From there we are thrown into the relationship of a young grocery clerk with his mother (the Oedipal part of the comedy), a domineering hag who will not allow him to court a pretty young customer he falls in love with. Mother is bitten by the rat at a zoo in New Zealand, and from then on, zombie contagion ensues. Mother builds a zombie coterie around her while an embarrassed son tries to hide it and sneaks out to see his girlfriend.The film brings you some of the most memorable zombie-horror-Oedipal-comedy ever put on celluloid (for this was a pre-CGI affair). The final scene even features a re-entry of our hero into the zombie-mother's womb. I mean, how much further can you take the Oedipus myth? In between, you are accosted by non-stop, lovingly done gore, including entrails that chase the hero through an attic, a head sliced off just below the eyes that looks around bewildered while getting kicked like a hockey puck, grave yard ninja zombies. And of course the lawn mower tour-de-force that was just too much for many film critics who did not appreciate the ballet-like quality alluded to above. Peter Jackson made every penny of his microscopic budget count. That's when he's at his best.This film is a cult classic, another grade-A B movie. Although a worthy successor to ""The Re-animator,"" with its preposterous plot and over the top characterization, it cannot enter into A territory, so 7/10 it must remain.

This movie is similar to the Evil Dead 2, this could have been: Evil Dead 4:Dead Alive. The mixing of comedy horror here is okay. However, the amounts of blood here are legendary.

The gore scenes can also be quite funny to a zombie getting his head ripped off with hedge clippers, to our hero using a damn lawnmower to destroy a horde of the undead! The blood was everywhere.

I won't tell you how the lawnmower fits into the plot, but it involves zombies and the greatest amount of fake blood ever used on a movie set. Might I suggest that you do not ingest huge amounts of pizza before viewing this movie? Just a tip.This is often talked about as a movie about zombies. I think calling it a ""zombie flick"" is to diminish its true qualities. Sure, this is a movie about zombies, but it's also a film about true love, oppressive mothers, annoying relatives, kung-fu priests, really ugly babies, rat monkeys, and why it's always a good thing to keep a lawnmower around when you're throwing a huge party and all the guests show up dead.How awesome is Braindead? It is far more awesome than your stupid mind can allow you to even comprehend. Imagine a movie with Jim Carrey, Bruce Campbell and Samuel L. Jackson fighting evil robots together, directed by Sam Raimi with a script by Tarantino, multiply this hypothetical film's awesomeness by 1000, and you might have a fraction of an idea of how awesome Braindead is. Still, Braindead's level of awesome can't be explained in the English language. You simply have to see it for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you - you might not be ready for it. Few movies ever reach this level of awesome.Unfortunately, I'm afraid only the true cult movie fan will truly appreciate what a work of blood-splattered art ""Braindead"" really is. Which is a shame, because it really is a great movie when watched with the right mindset. Perhaps not a film for movie critics, this is for the human being in all of us that can appreciate over-the-top gore and violence for fun's sake.

I had overlooked the early films of Peter Jackson's, mostly because they had that weird-looking way they always looked, sort of like a Sam Raimi film in his past days. Although the originality is a plus, I found it a bit rudimentary in cinematography, even if the stop-motion animation is a big factor to the look.The film is closer to a hilarious spoof of a zombie film than an actual, scary film. Jackson's premise must've been strongly based on being able to see as much blood-splatter more than to complicate the story beyond respect. I like the weird story pretty much. There's also something to said about Jackson's addition of psychobilly music to the party scene (like he has his finger on the pulse of the underground scenes in music and culture). The film is loaded with hilarious death scenes and creations of ""monsters."" Any scene with the ""zombie"" baby getting into mischief is hilarious.All in all, I think everyone needs to see it, if not make it a classic in your collection. There are strange aesthetics for the way things look and how the actors act which didn't really draw me into the story at all, but it has a quality of something like the Evil Dead series, so I can see how a cult can be made out of Jackson's movies as well.",Dead Alive
112,chelano,Oh look! A chubby baby zombie!,6,14 October 2010,"I will admit that the story to this film is just really cheesy. A diseased rat monkey bites someone and then you have zombies. I think the writers really had their thinking caps on in this one. But that is not what makes this film enjoyable. It is the zombies. They were so well done with different personalities. Especially the zombie baby. What a great and creepy little character. They did jump into the whole zombie scenes pretty quick, which was good since the story was going no where in the beginning. The cast was OK. Timothy Balme was decent but the girl played by Diana Penalver was on the verge of annoying to watch. The side cast had some fun gems to watch like Elizabeth the mom and the priest who was Stuart Devenie. This film really does go in a book of fun zombie films to watch. It is not so much scary as it is bloody. There are a few jumping scenes though. You will find yourself watching the film watching to see what zombie they come up with next. Mostly you see normal zombies in films which show a person with an eye out or a missing jaw. This film just goes overboard when it comes to characters. For example. One guy gets grabbed by his head and has his head and spine ripped out the backside of his body. Later you get to see this crazy character walking around. These type of films you can expect much from the story, but it gets an A+ in creativity in characters.",Dead Alive

Timothy Balme, Diana Penalver, Elizabeth Moody, Ian Watkin, Brenda Kendall, Stuart Devenie, Jed Brophy, Stephen Papps, Murray Keane. One of Jackson's first films, a disgusting blood-spattered gorefest that has been labeled `the goriest movie of all time.' And it certainly seems that way! A young man's mother is bitten by a rat monkey and its poison turns her, and others (since people killed by zombies become zombies) into a zombie. Every disgusting thing possible is in this movie: from Kung Fu-fighting Catholic priests and babies in blenders to animated farting intestines and zombies chopped into slush by a lawnmower. The movie is not, I repeat NOT, meant to be taken seriously, with the funniest sequence involving the hero and a baby zombie during an afternoon park stroll. Not for the faint of heart (no eating pasta while viewing) but certainly a delight in its own repellent way. And remember: `I kick a** for the Lord!' RATING: 7 out of 10.",Dead Alive

Constantly gets weirder, a good sense of escalation through special effects
Can be genuinely funny, masterfully uses physical comedy to balance out the horrible events happening in the story
Capable of entertaining action
Fitting, catchy theme song
Remains remarkably unexpectedCons:
Mysticism and parents backstory was unnecessary
Some zombie designs made little senseBest part: anything the baby is doing in the third act, it's the source of the best physical comedy in the movie
Worst part: the main character yelling at his mom on the roof, like why would you try to have a moral debate with a zombie dinosaur rat monster",Dead Alive

A great movie from start to finish, the climax is one of the best I've seen and the violence has to be the worst I've ever seen. But all in all it's also funny to watch, I loved it.

It had me laughing my head off by the end, it was that good. One of the best comedy-horrors I've ever seen.Once things really got going the ideas kept coming thick and fast, one after another, delivering some absolutely amazing content and fabulous entertainment. Even the creepy uncle turned into an axe-wielding zombie bashing dude.I didn't really appreciate the humour element at first such as gluing mother's face back together so that she could keep up appearances in front of the visiting guild members, but once the line ""I kick ass in the name of the Lord"" was uttered I started to fully grasp the manic tongue-in-cheek element of it all.It must have been an absolute riot to film and be involved with.

118,80sHorror,"Classic, Sick, and outrageously entertaining gore-fest!,",10,20 November 2011,"BrainDead is very violent, bloody and gory! And thats the main thing that makes this film so incredibly good so if you don't like gory films or haven't got a strong stomach then stay away from BrainDead, stay away for your own good!!! But if you can look past all the intense blood and gore then this is actually quiet a well made, written and directed film! And with Peter Jackson as the director what do you expect! I still cant believe that this is from the same man who gave us 'The Lord of the Rings' (trilogy) and 'King Kong' (2005 remake)!!! This film didn't exactly have the biggest budget ever and the cast of actors wont be winning any awards. Although the films that good you can look past the bad acting. And if you don't like films that don't have all the things that a good film should have then you'll pleased to know that BrainDead actually has a decent story, maybe a little short and quiet simple but if you watch 'Bad Taste' (another Peter Jackson comedy/gore classic) then you'll understand that it isn't the lengte and complexity of a sorry that makes a film good! And another thing you'll like in this film is that it is actually very funny! The part where the main character takes out the 'zombie baby' out to the park and the 'kung-fu priest' scene is especially funny! But like 'Bad Taste' you wont find this film as funny if you aren't amused by 'black comedy'. If you are a fan of zombie films then this whole review is pointless because you will definitely like this film, it has everything from gore to a budget so if you are into that type of film then buy this right now!!!!!!!

A brilliant combination of campy horror story, creative monsters and lots of fake blood.Lots of horror movies rely on dark scenes and endless suspense with very little payoff. This movie has a simple creepy rat monkey creates monsters, effective and lots of monsters where no two are alike. Lots of lame horror movies use the combination of fast camera scene change + loud sound to startle you. No this movie uses the fantastic imagination to create bad guys that discover new ways to kill others. Lots of horror movies only have a couple of money shotsthis movie has money shot after money shot. And for low budget the gore and special effects is outstanding. One of the most fun horror movies I have seen in a long timeand this was made a long time ago, 1992, I do not know how I did not discover this before. There are lots of outrageous gore scenes, which were great, after all it is already unrealistic so why not have some unrealistic gore scenes.This movie showcased Peter Jackson in only his 4th movie directing. Jackson also did visual effects with miniatures and stop motion, Also the tandem of Richard and Dominic Taylor in special effects was showcased.This could easily become a cult classic.

The plot is the craziest plot that I have seen and everything about it was awesome.Even writing this review, the zombie baby, the rat-monkey and the giant zombie on the roof are still embedded in my head.

The funniest scene of all is the breakfast scene, where every one of the basement zombies has some bizarre and funny moments during their meal.

This is one bloody, violent, and gory movie. Even the first three-minutes provide some nice hacking at limbs; but the monumental status this film hits is in its third-act, as all Hell breaks loose in Lionel's (the main character) house, as there is non-stop bloodshed -- and it's actually quite inventive. As for where the comedy plays in, it is all over the place, even though it primarily clings to slapstick, there's plenty of laughs to behold as there's a karate-chopping priest, a demented zombie baby, and intestines that come alive and cause our main protagonists quite some misfortune.Overall, anyone looking for something hilarious to watch on a Friday or Saturday night is sure to find great enjoyment with Braindead.

IF THE READER DOESN'T WANT THE FILM TO POSSIBLY BE SPOILED FOR THEM, THEN I SUGGEST WATCHING THE MOVIE BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. Thank You.**I do believe that this movie is supposed to be a horror comedy, or so that's my best guess anyway. Anything else that would've been aimed for would've just been ridiculous. It's so silly it makes me laugh. The ""well constructed"" and planned over-the-top effects were executed perfectly in this film. When the movie started, I thought it was going to be a monster on an island type movie, but boy was I wrong. A team of zoologists capture this weird looking rat thing, and bring it back to the states to be placed in a zoo. They knew that whoever gets bit from the rat thing, will turn brain dead (""Brain Dead"" is the original title.)and develop zombie like traits. When they become infected, it's just like any other zombie, once it bites someone else, then they'll be transformed as well. This all begins to happen at the zoo when the son of a wealthy old woman goes to the zoo, and spies on her son with a woman he met delivering them their groceries from their regular store. For some reason she didn't want him seeing other women (this is explained towards the end of the movie to why she didn't want him dating). She then gets bit by the rat when she was hiding behind a bush spying on them, because she got too close to the cage. When she screamed, the guy (her son) recognizes it, and dreads it. He notices her getting bit, but she pushes it off of her, and bashes its skull in off the ground. This is where the fun begins in the movie. Believe me. It's a trip and a half. The guy starts stuffing people that become infected in his mother's old basement (now his basement because of inheritance after his mother's death), hoping no one will find out. It's funny as hell because he starts feeding the zombies, and grooming them; along with whatever other goofy sh*t, like sitting them down and helping them get comfortable. He does all sorts of hospitality chores for them, which I actually got a kick out of. There's also a bunch of ridiculous mishaps that occur while he is attempting to keep this situation isolated, while also in the midst of battling with his uncle over the inheritance of the manor. This movie tickled me in some parts. Some will find it silly/funny, and others will find it over-the-top stupidity. Depends on what kind of person you are. The acting is fair, the script is fair, the story- line is silly, and the dialog is also silly. I would recommend this movie to people who appreciate low budget comedy horror, for a one time laugh.",Dead Alive

Lionel's mama didn't like this too much, but she was bitten on the arm by a rat monkey while she was spying on the lovebirds at the zoo. Things wouldn't be so bad, but mum turns into a zombie and begins biting others and making them into zombies too. One of the funniest scenes is when the priest uses kung fu against the zombies (he ""kicks arse for the lord""). Although Lionel tries to keep the zombies under control, it really doesn't work that well and they escape and run amok while his sleazy uncle is having a party.

127,Det_McNulty,"Quite Possibly The Goriest Film Ever Made; Silly, Odd, Mad, Disgusting and Unique",7,19 November 2006,"Today, when somebody says the name Peter Jackson you automatically think of Lord Of The Rings or possibly Kind Kong. Well even though Lord Of The Rings is certainly Peter Jackson's finest achievement, let's not forget his early gore fest Braindead. If you're a fan of Peter Jackson's latter works and want to check out his previous works I think it would be good of me to warm you in advance that Braindead is not everybody's type of film. But if you're a horror fan or a fan of experimental and daring cinema then I urge to watch Braindead.A film such of Braindead is one that has no message, moral and no meaning. And yet even with all that it still remains a breakthrough horror film that really does have style. Some of the most unique scenes in history are filled with hysterical one-liners that become instantly quotable. The script is so downright ridiculous that it's hard to take the film seriously and that's what the film wanted to be. The shock factor is incredible and the focus on all the fine details shows how much time and effort has been put into the film.The start of the film is an obvious reference to one of Peter Jackson's favourite films and that is King Kong (which he would later remake). Right from the opening the gore starts flooding in, at first it comes in small doses and as the film progresses you'll find it piling on. The gore is extremely comic and fake, but that's what makes it so frenzied. The use of slapstick style humour in the fights and the unconventional retro style the film is filmed in. This all helps to make it become an original and offbeat experience.Some of the direction is exceptional, my favourite bit of direction would have to be at the start of the film where you see Lionel's mother holding the knife, purposely flashing it in front of the camera with a odd grimace on her face. Another one would be where you see the Lionel mowing the lawn and there's a shot of the lawn mower blade rotating round. These items will all become main parts of the film as you get further and further to the extreme final 20 minutes.If I was to say what kind of film Braindead is I'd find it very difficult because it's hard to categorise it, but I anything it's a cross between Psycho and Night Of The Living Dead. The countless references to Psycho are blatantly obvious for anybody who knows something about film. The film's use of orchestral music is tremendous and works seamlessly with the ""zombie killing"" scenes. Lionel is such a peculiar character and that's what makes him so perfect for the film's goof ball story.A highly unique and hilarious film, but definitely not recommended for the faint hearted. Yes it's over the top and lacks any kind of narration or subtext to the story, but it still remains one of the visceral experiences you're ever likely to see.",Dead Alive

There were 3 underground gross-out classics that Mr. Jackson directed before he became the Academy award winning director that he is today and that would be this film along with ""Bad Taste"" and ""Meet the Feebles"" but perhaps none go as far as ""Dead Alive"". From what I have read there were literally MILLIONS of gallons of stage blood used to make this film! It is a dark comedy done in the style of the ""Evil Dead"" series...entirely tongue in cheek. So outrageous and over the top are the gore effects that they actually produce laughter from the audience instead of retching. Instead of vomiting in your chair you will undoubtedly laugh until you pee your pants. That's what makes this film so unique, the fact that, even though the effects are incredibly elaborate and gory, this film absolutely refuses to be take itself to seriously. In my estimation, Mr. Jackson should have received his first Academy Award for this film, at least for the effects.",Dead Alive

Reality itself, maybe, though reality, when it comes to such extremes, isn't funny at all...One must have a solid sense of humor to truly appreciate this little diamond, which plays with cliches, taboos, inner fright and sentiments in such an iconoclast way that I understand some people just can't stand more than a glimpse on some scenes!What is incredible is the amount of work in the scenography: this would be a bloody good comedy even without the gore! Some of my friends just didn't see this as they were far too disgusted by the gore topping, what a pity. Because the whole story, deep within, is a marvelous metaphoric analysis.

132,boondocksaint20,Forget the Evil Dead...THIS IS THE GORIEST FILM OF ALL TIME!,9,16 November 2002,"Okay, I'm a huge horror film fan.  I thought Dawn of the Dead, Re-Animator or the Evil Dead films were the goriest movies prior to seeing this.  Boy was I wrong!Words cannot describe the violence contained in this movie.  It's directed by Peter Jackson, yes, the same guy who directed Lord of the Rings, and for an early 90's New Zealand filmed movie, this one sets the standard for gore in films.  It's as if Peter Jackson wanted to make a movie that far surpasses any gore-fest by 1000%.  What do I mean by gore?  I'm talking more than the simple decapitation or zombies munching on human remains...oh, it has that too, but add a severed head being diced in a blender, a human spine with intestines squirming that stalks and tries to choke the main character for the last 30 minutes of the film, a guy's face being ripped off of his head, a zombie thrusting its hand through the back of a screaming lady's head and then choking another victim with the same hand sprawling out of her mouth, a guy's entire chest (ribs and all) being ripped out of his body while he is screaming, DOZENS of corpses meeting untimely ends via a lawnmower and of course, the most disgusting pudding eating scene ever filmed.  Plus dozens of other shocking scenes and almost literally waterfalls full of gore splattering around the place.Okay, for such an over the top movie, and me being a horror buff I have to be completely honest on this one.  I am so surprised to say this, but it is really entertaining.  There are scenes that will totally gross you out, but Peter Jackson films everything as a black comedy.  Almost every 'gross out' scene is played for dark humor, which is very effective.  If you can take it, you'll be literally laughing out loud at the extreme violence and obsurdity of this one, not necessarily b\c it's funny in a natural sense, but b\c it is so obsurd.  There is basically no plot in this one, a man's mother gets bitten by this foreign rat-monkey thing and then she turns into a zombie.  Soon, she starts turning others into zombies as well, and then when about 50 swingers come to party at their mansion (the place where the main character keeps the growing number of zombie bodies, away from others) all freaking hell breaks loose.  I'm talking like 30 minutes of PURE GORE. I know this one will please gore fanatics, especially b\c it is underrated and not as well known as the Evil Dead films.  If gore is your thing, DEFINITELY check this one out, however, a word of caution, this movie is so gory, that if you can't see the humor (and Peter Jackson amazingly provides humor in every single gore scene, and there are dozens of them) in the gore scenes, which are very bloody and rather disturbing then please, do not, I repeat do not rent this movie.  I could see how people with weak stomachs would throw up while watching this movie.  But, for those who like ultra dark comedy and ultra gore, by all means, rent this one.Okay, I've commented a lot on the gore which is ubiquitous in this film. The question remains, did I like it?  Honestly, yes I did.  And I'll tell you why.  First of all, the main love interest with the two main characters is very cute and I was rooting for them to end up together the entire time. Second, I have to be honest, the movie was directed very well and incredibly stylish.  I saw a lot of similarities in direction from this and LOTR. Okay, onto the gore.  Me, I like gore in films if it's played for CAMP, not SHOCK or GROSS OUT.  This one was played for all three, and there were times I was exclaiming profanities in response to the scenes I had just witnessed, but I must say, I did have fun watching this one.  However, I can take the gore, though I know most people could not.  I saw the unrated version of Dead Alive, though apparently there is a way toned down R-rated version out there too that I haven't seen.  But anyway, if you can stomach it, this is without a doubt the most unique and underrated 'horror' film I've ever seen (it's not really a horror film b\c it is not that scary).  I have to give props to any director who directs an indie flick and goes to the extreme to create his vision WHILE doing a stylish and superb job at the task he was trying to accomplish.  That is why I love B-movies, it is b\c there are no rules, the director does what he wants and we get movies that are over-the-top, or anti-Hollywood.  This one is as over-the-top as you can get, and that is saying a lot!!!I have to give this one 9/10 stars b\c it was very entertaining even though it was incredibly gory and at times made me have to think about running to the bathroom.  The director had a vision, and he more than accomplished it, which is rare in these days.  I'm glad I saw it, so I could make it a milestone over the other horror movies I thought to be too gory (haha, those films have nothing on this one!!), but will I ever see it again?  Probably not.  However, as I said, despite the gore, there is a very interesting and sweet love story admist this, and you will be rooting for the main characters the whole time.  What a great casting job!  See this one if you really love over-the-top violence.  The reason I didn't give this one a perfect rating is b\c there was next to no plot and it was not that scary (though still entertaining).  I honestly can't believe I am rating this one so high, but when I look at other reviews on this site on this one, I don't feel as bad.  9/10 stars.",Dead Alive
133,fibreoptic,YOUR MOTHER ATE MY DOG!!!!!!,9,26 July 2004,"I first watched this in 1993. My mates came around with a video they had rented saying that it was some kind of new zombie movie. I was like ""cool, slap it on"" and what befell our eyes was nothing short of intense. We all thought it was excellent. Of course i'm talking about the super gory zombie horror comedy 'Braindead'. Six years later in 1999 i had the opportunity to purchase it cheap on video so i did and watched it many times. Three years after that in 2002 i lent the video to my then at the time girlfriend about two weeks before we broke up. Sooooo along with my mobile phone she nicked my copy of Braindead! So i was happy when i came across another copy of this from a certain source for absolutely free the other day ;o)The movie is fantastic in nearly every way and where Peter Jackson succeeded with Bad Taste he has took it to the next level with Braindead. It's full of gore, comedy and memorable lines like the one mentioned in my one line summary. My two minor gripes about this movie is that the rat monkey looks bad and the lawnmower scene. Don't get me wrong, i love the lawnmower scene, it's cool as f*** but i have a personal fear of lawnmowers so it don't half make me cringe when watching that scene.

It is in the same vein as Jackson's earlier works Bad Taste and Meet the Feebles but Braindead is rather more polished, with a budget of around $3 million. Although it starts with the capture of a zombie-creating creature on the eerie Skull Island, the movie is relatively low-key in its opening half. Only in the second part does it spiral out of control into a blood-filled zombie film.In fact there is so much blood and guts that half of it is hard to believe like pulling off your face by holding your hair! Its bizarre, but still good.",Dead Alive

136,tyranid_slayer,sure to be a cult classic,9,31 May 2007,This film was on t.v. the other night and i decided to watch it hearing that i was probably one of the most goriest movies of all time.The film follows this guy who is a bit of a mummys boy. Until his mother is bitten by a rat monkey she turns into a zombie. The film follows that basic idea meaning the more folk that become infected by the zombie the harder the guy has to try to keep them hidden.Being told it was a really gory movie thats why i watched it i was quite disappointed until the last sequence where the whole house is run amock with zombies. i loved it. Killing zombies with lawnmowers using the spine as an extended neck whooooo.This film is probably one of Peter Jacksons best but not known well enough to be considered a cult classic.,Dead Alive

As opposed to most of today's horror movies, Brain Dead doesn't take itself too seriously. The story is not very important in that movie: it's the blood and gore that counts. Most characters are really funny(watch out for that kung-fu priest) but Pakita(the hero's girlfriend) is pretty annoying. Most scenes are absolutely disgusting and you should not watch this movie if you are sensible to that. One of my friends could not stand it. The gory scenes are all very ""creative"".

141,cwbellor,I kick ass for the Lord!!!!!,8,10 February 2011,"I remember watching John Water's Pink Flamingos with a group of friends and thinking that it must be the grossest, most tasteless film out there. Tasteless? Probably. Grossest? Look out, here comes Dead Alive (a.k.a. Braindead). This film can typically be found in the horror section of the video store. However, chances are that most video stores that aren't too ashamed to have a cult section would be smart enough to put it there. That's because this film is not scary by any means. It is disturbing,DISGUSTING, and funny, making it most deserving of the cult label. It may also make some nostalgic for the lost days of puppeteering, prosthetics and mechanics instead of CGI for visual effects. There are very few movies that are 90% an experience for the senses that hasn't been witnessed before. You would have a hard time convincing me of another film that has used more fake blood than this production. Braindead has found every bodily way to be disgusting without displaying sexual organs and for that, we should probably thank the lord. The climax with all of its blood and prosthetics becomes a bit overkill - pun intended. If you check out this film let me give you some advise: * It is going to be disgusting and you should keep in mind that this is in order to create shock value and it is funny simply because it is disturbing and vomit inducing. * Make sure you watch it with someone else who doesn't have a bad stomach and isn't Christian. I say this because I watched it with my dad and it is very rare that the two of us laugh so hard during a movie that one of us starts to cry - ME. The MTV movie awards has a category for best fight. I realize that Braindead was not well known at the time it came out. But for the love of all that is hilarious and random, this movie has a kungfu fighting priest who kicks zombie ass and deserved the best fight statuette more than anyone in '92. And just when you think this film can't get anymore disgusting, here comes mum!",Dead Alive

Timothy Balme plays Lionel, a shy 20 something dominated by his mother. On following Lionel and his girlfriend, Mum stumbles and gets bitten by a Sinbad-style Dynamation Rat Monkey. What follows is superb comedy mixed with as much blood as you can take. This has been proven the goriest movie ever thanks to its grand finale with the lawnmower. Spot Peter Jackson playing the undertakers assistant. He acts like Derek from 'Bad Taste' which is also very good. The amount of mayhem and hilarious moments like Lionel fighting his mum and the nurse while his girlfriend tidies up downstairs are brill.

This film is a delight for any gore fan and is laugh-out-loud hilarious with scene after scene designed just to disgust and it works a treat. The characters are all great in their own way and funny (especially the Kiwi accents) and Jackson directs this film at a frenetic pace. But this film is all about the gore and it builds up to a spectacularly nasty finale; an amazing combination of imaginative gore and hilarious incident.

The wonderful world turns upside down when the hero of this story tries to deal with all of the zombies that his mother has created.  Instead of killing them, he tries to sedate them.  The winner scenes are the zombies having sex, the zombie mother falling through the roof, and of course the rat monkey.  This is one of those films where you know it is not serious after the mother has her skin glued back onto her face. 
Special effects winners are the zombie punching out the face of one victim, the zombie who is lit up by a light bulb, and the nurse chomping down on her lover's lips.  Favorite scene is the hero trying to run away but slipping and sliding on all the guts on the floor.If you don't like comedy or zombies do not watch this movie.

The plot for the movie centres around Lionel, Lionel is a lonely man who finds love by chance with a Spanish girl called Paquita, but there is one person who is determined to ruin the relationship for Lionel, and that is his nasty controlling mother, Vera.On Lionel's 1st date with Paquita, they are at the zoo, Vera follows them and spies on them, but in the process she slip's onto one of the animal cages and gets bitten by this mysterious 'rat monkey'.The poison from the rat monkey's bite starts to turn Vera into a bloodthirsty zombie-like creature and she in turn bites other people and turns them into these undead creatures!!! Lionel and Paquita have to work together to keep Vera and her undead friends from causing uproar and devastation in the local community, so he locks them in the cellar and uses lots of tranquilisers to keep them under control, but they break loose during a big party which Lionel's nasty fat uncle Les has planned for all his friends.Greedy Les is not only after Lionels share of the inheritance, he wants the big house, and also Lionels girlfriend Paquita!!!! Can Lionel and Paquita save the day or will the party turn into a massive zombie-fest.Braindead has some great characters, a great story, it remains to this day one of the goriest films ever made and it's also very fast paced and great fun throughout, excellent stuff!

148,d_fienberg,"Disgusting, Creative, And Wonderful",9,16 January 2001,"The quick and obligatory warning: Dead Alive (as Braindead really ought to be called) is not for everybody. Heck, it's not for most people. But if you think that the idea of a zombie baby getting whacked with a swing is funny, or that endocrine systems can come alive, or that rat monkeys are the root of all evil, then it just doesn't get any better than this.I can't think of more than a half dozen movies that give me as much pleasure as Dead Alive. It's laugh-out-loud hilarious throughout, strangely touching in places, and the gore is meted out in the most original ways possible. I'm a big fan of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead (the best of the ""Dead"" series, as far as I'm concerned), but Dead Alive is the king of Zombie movies. While Dead Alive lacks Dawn's comentary on modern society and its media critique, it far more successfully handles of the issue of what would happen if two zombies had a baby. And sometimes that's just what you want in a movie.Braindead (or Dead Alive, to keep things confusing) is really just a sweet story of a boy named Lionel (Timothy Balme) and a girl named Paquita (Diane Peñalver) who are meant to be together. And, as the timeless tale goes, the boy's demanding mother just doesn't approve. However, when the mother gets bitten by the Sumatran Rat Monkey and becomes a zombie, well, the relationship is put to the test.That Dead Alive is able to bounce between being a parody of classical Hollywood romance, a terrifying ooze-fest, and spine-rippingly hilarious is a tribute to Peter Jackson. Jackson has written and directed five full length features and for my money he hasn't missed once. While his first zombie film, Bad Taste, is really only a warm-up for Dead Alive, and his first Hollywood film (the criminally underrated The Frighteners) was a box office disaster, Jackson has a unique visual and tonal style. Even though the relationship between Paquita and Lionel is meant to be humorous, it also feels completely genuine. Amidst the puss is true loopy charm. That's how the man behind the raunchy Muppets off-shoot Meet The Feebles could also gain true critical credibility with the Kate Winslet film Heavenly Creatures. Jackson has yet to prove that there's anything he can't do.
Dead Alive is bouyed by a number of game performances. Clearly neither lead is a great actor, but they both throw themselves into the characters producing both chemistry and a Bruce Campbell level of campiness. And as for the collection of bodily fluids, muscles, and organs on display, much credit to the technical staff.If you don't like Dead Alive, you'll have turned it off within ten minutes. If you stay for the whole thing, though, you'll love it. Dead Alive is a running exercise in bad taste, a series of escalating gags, all of which work perfectly. I figure this one is good for a 9.5/10.",Dead Alive

150,eched,Simply a great film,10,26 October 2010,"So, yes, Dead Alive! Said by well all horror fans to be the most blood filled film ever, period (can't say for sure, haven't seen Tokyo Gore Police yet), it was made in the 90s and was directed by Peter Jackson, that's right, the guy that made The Lord Of the Rings.Do to how blood filled this movie is, it was going to become a cult classic no matter what, weather it was good or bad. Lucky for me it was good, actually one of the most enjoyable horror films I've seen in years and in many ways comparable to the Evil Dead films, which is one of the best horror series there is.Anyways, the plot is Lionel is shy, nervous, and a tad dumb. His mom is over powering and given the amount of work she has him do, he doesn't have a life of his own. Do to him being, well, a push over, he doesn't have the guts to stand up to his mom or set his life straight. When his mom is bit by a rat monkey(ya, I'm not making that up) she becomes a zombie. Lionel though, being one to always ignore his problems, simply tries to ignore the fact that she is a zombie and tries to have a normal life. Things get more and more out of control though as zombie mom starts turning other towns' people into zombies and before Lionel knows it, he's got a basement full of the undead.This is what's called a splatter comedy. Pretty much they have a tone of blood and slap stick comedy and the idea is the film is supposed to be so over the top with its violence and random ball plot that you can't help but find it funny. You'll laugh at a lot of parts not cause they are funny per say, but because they are downright so odd. Like, this has a zombie baby running around, and I don't know why, but that's really funny! What's interesting about this film though is despite the tones of blood and gore, it actually still has a theme and a message to the story. Don't ignore your problems in life. If you ignore your problems they are only going to get worse until one day you wake up surrounded by flesh eating zombies! The most interesting scenes in this by far are the ones where Lionel helplessly tries to ignore the zombie issue and have a normal life. There's one scene where he has all the zombies at the dinner table and is trying to have a normal meal with them. It's just odd.Another interesting thing about the film is it tries really hard to change the zombie mythology and make zombies its own. Ever since Night of The Living Dead zombies have pretty much always been done the same way. It's not like with vampires where the film can do whatever it wants with them. Zombies have become very ridged in film. So, it's pretty uncommon to see a film play around with them as this one does.The zombies in this spread by bites, and by cutting your skin. So if one gets its nails in you, you'll still become a zombie. Also, these zombies don't die if you shoot them in the head. Each body part of theirs can live on its own. If you cut off a hand, that hand will get up and come after you. So, they are next to unstoppable.Lastly they don't kill to feed. Their attacks are emotion based. When someone first becomes a zombie in the film they will likely kill anything in site, but if you tie them down and try to calm them down, they'll actually become nice after awhile. There are a few scenes where Lionel walks around them and they just ignore him. They only really become violent again near the end.This is an interesting idea because it's not like in other zombie films where when someone you love has become a zombie they are nothing like what they used to be. In this, they are still who they used to be, they're just also dead and are very violent. This makes it a lot harder for Lionel to except that his mom is dead, and actually adds a lot to the story.Lastly, one of the coolest things about this movie is its filming style and set design. It REALLY feels like you are watching Bugs Bunny. This is as cartoon like as a film with live actors can become. The playful camera movement, the colourful set designs, and the crazy violence just makes it feel like an animated movie. If Bugs Bunny did pop up mid way in the movie, he would blend in and you wouldn't even notice the guy.As such the camera work and set design are both amazing. It is painfully funny, the hero is actually a really nice guy you can't help but love, and over all its just a really creative and fun little movie.I give it a 10 out of 10. It's a must for anyone that likes splatter comedy. If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Evil Dead 2, you MUST see this film.",Dead Alive

I've never seen ""Bad Taste,"" Peter Jackson's other gore opus, but can certainly imagine what it was like with this follow up.Dead Alive is a zombie comedy that never takes itself seriously. The gore is so over-the-top that it is farcical from the very beginning. This was obviously Jackson's intention, and he tries very hard to gross out his audience. In fact, I'll bet he was the one that got the biggest kick out of the movie, sitting in theaters watching the test audiences get up and run to the restrooms to vomit. Jackson was apparently inspired by the black humor of Monty Python, since ridiculous gore was also one of their trademarks.Somewhere past the buckets of blood there was a story here, and it reminded me of an extended situation comedy. What starts out as a small problem grows exponentially as the main character of Lionel struggles hard to keep his house full of zombies under wraps, but more people keep showing up to visit and adding to the growing undead population. This is the first zombie movie I've ever seen where the zombies themselves become characters with some degree of personality, instead of just masses of flesh craving psychopaths.Although I love horror and enjoy gore if it reinforces the story, this was really too much. It was definitely gore for the sake of gore, and I got the point very early on. Because the blood and guts were so unbelievable, the movie was not as disturbing as say ""Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer"" or other such films.It was nonetheless entertaining, and I got to see what all the fuss was about. This is most certainly not a movie for everyone, and only gorehounds need apply. The only reason I'd ever need to see it again is to watch it with friends and be amused by their reactions. I would probably know then how Peter Jackson felt.",Dead Alive

155,SamuraiNixon,A movie that warped my fragile little mind.,7,14 August 1999,"This is the most violent movie I have ever seen. The violence is so over blown that it is comedic. It is analogous to Evil Dead II in that it is bloody, funny, and definitely gross. This movie is destined to be a cult classic. Some lines such as ""I kick butt for the lord"" are going to be remembered as long as lines from Taxi Driver (""You looking at me!"") and Midnight Cowboy (""Can't you see I'm walking here.""). Well maybe not, but there is great dialogue.The only problem with it is the low budget nature of the movie -- the clay animation of the evil monkey is horrendous (ranks up there with the terminator in Nemesis). Once the movie gets to Lionel and his mom, then the movie starts to roll.The plot of the movie is that a monkey imported from a foreign place is cursed and whatever it bites is turned into a flesh-eating zombie. Lionel's mom gets bit by this creature and then stomps the creature to death. She then infects the rest of the town. The subplot involves Lionel and the women he loves. There is friction between Lionel's zombie mom and Lionel about his girlfriend. I let you figure the rest by watching the movie if you have the guts for it.Beware of the shorter version.  Do not get the 85-minute R-rated purged piece.  The unrated version is 97 minutes and can be found under the name Braindead.  The movie is exceedingly violent, though not in misogynist tone of braindead slasher flicks such as I spit on your grave or any Jason flicks that are unbearable to watch.

When a man's mother gets accidentally bitten by the rat monkey, mayhem ensues. Dead Alive, also known as Braindead, was Peter Jackson's third feature after the splatter fest Bad Taste and crude Muppet parody Meet the Feebles. Jackson this time delivers a humorous take on the zombie genre, which harkens to the likes of Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead in its combination of physical comedy with blood and guts galore. Dead Alive is said to be the bloodiest movie of all time and I'm not exaggerating! One of the final sequences required 5 gallons of blood to be pumped out per second! That's absolutely ludicrous! Thankfully it pays off and the film remains one of the greatest zombie comedies of all time.Timothy Balme excellently pulls off the wild physical comedy and in all honesty, he is a runner up for Bruce Campbell in terms of giving the best performance in a zombie horror comedy.

Whilst spying on her dotting son Lionel & sweetheart Paquita, oldhand Vera is bitten. Due to the infectious bite she becomes a zombie. Not wanting to kill her, Lionel hides her in the basement. He goes to great lengths in trying to keep her a secret from everyone else. Nevertheless, Vera escapes unleashing the infectious zombie plague. Lionel and Paquita are the only ones left to fight a growing army of the ""braindead"".Critique: 'Night of the Living Dead' meets 'Laurel and Hardy' in this hilarious spoof of the splatter movies. Director Peter Jackson's messy gem is a no-holds barred experiment in special FX, seen through a wickedly unique eye. Though the film borrows heavily from others (including 'Psycho', Romero's Living Dead trilogy, the 'Evil Dead' series, and even 'Indiana Jones'), Jackson has created something so insidious that it immediately attained cult-status, and its easy to see why. It has cajoling dialog (""So, you've found your dad's old stag movies eh!?..Is that the one with the donkey and the chambermaid?""), great special effects worthy of Hollywood big shots, ham actors at their snappy best (my favorite is Lionel's uncle), and unique musical score(like the ones in silent films).

162,aptpupil79,the most tame thing we experience is a head in a blender,9,21 March 2003,"i finally got around to watching this oft-recommended movie. if you have a light stomach or are squeamish then i wouldn't suggest you read this review, much less watch this movie. okay...there are two kinds of horror movies: the serious ones that build atmosphere and use psychology, music, camera angles, and everything else to get into your head and make you uneasy; like the shining, the ring or dawn of the dead. then there are those like evil dead (a big influence on this film) and reanimator which go completely over the top with gore and play with the horror film conventions in order to (hopefully) make you laugh. dead alive falls into the latter category. there are times in the first 30 minutes where you might be scared or your skin will crawl, but for the most part this is about laughs, pushing boundaries and doing so intelligently. the important part of that point is the last one - intelligence. this movie, like evil dead, has a strong cinematic undercurrent; that is, throughout the film you are aware that the director know what he's doing - this isn't an amateur who is just making a gore flick for fun. the screenplay, as well as the cinematography and direction, all confirm this fact. the last 10 minutes or so really shine. in fact in the last 30 minutes of the film the most tame thing we experience is a head in a blender. one of the more funny moments is after a zombie's intestines fall on the floor they begin to creep along the ground after the protagonist only to take a break and fart mid-chase. priceless filmmaking. anyone thinking at this point that i'm insane or that this film isn't all its cracked up to be is sorely mistaken. the genius of this film is well-established and certainly contributed to peter jackson being chosen to direct the lord of the rings trilogy. it's a great movie with a well-established 20 minutes of normalcy at the beginning to offer a great contrast to the last 30 minutes of putrescence that cap off the film. oh and the symbolism and surprise ending further confirm my feelings for this fine piece of work. one last note...it definitely was inspired by evil dead - the gore, the feel and the protagonist busting down the door at the end were all totally out of evil dead, but it's important to add that it wasn't too derivative - rather it was its own movie with occasional nods to its mentor.

Moreover, I better would like to explain why this film is so great in order to fulfill my review of one of the most unique, interesting and yet stupidly fun films of all time.Imagine a single film in which you might find, comedy, horror, suspense, gut wrenching gore feast, ninja priests, mating zombies, baby zombies, as well as romance, drama and even a sub-plot of murder. Now if you can't think of anything, stop thinking and go get this film, since it is all the things I've said and more. You won't believe your eyes, and you'll start wandering ""How in the world did anyone could come up with something like this?!!"", and no matter what you see...you won't be able to get off your seat for the whole time. What surprises me and I admire the most is the baldness with which Jackson makes his films. He doesn't care about the audience or the distributors, nor even of the censors; he just makes the things he would like to see on film for himself. I imagine that he sits in his living room with a box of pop corn along with his sons and tells ""look what daddy did"".Obviously, this is not a film for all tastes and I figure that most of the people that has seen it are disgusted by it.

The plot is irrelevant, because it's simply a vehicle to move the movie from one zombie splatter scene to the next.  This movie doesn't have one serious moment in it, which makes it all the more easier to stand.  If you are the least bit squeamish, Avoid like the Plague!!, because the blood gets real deep real fast in this one.

To be sure, it's a great show, very much in the spirit of the 3-Stooges-meets-slaughterhouse theme of the ""Evil Dead"" movies (well, the 2nd one anyway). But darn it all people! Even zombies need rules to live by! In George Romero's zombie series, they understood this, and came up with very specific methods to stop their zombies. But here what kills one zombie only further irritates another. Luckily, one can try to ignore this glaring flaw and revel in the scenes in which zombies and mortals are dismantled in just about every way possible. But the movie begins to falter under its own gore-streaken ponderousness (kinda like that last line). This is what made this one slightly less than perfect for me.

170,Jakethemuss,Unprecedented gore,8,24 July 2007,"I remember watching this movie on C4 about 6 years ago, and was quite frankly amazed by the amount of on-screen violence and gore. It is all done in a slapstick, black humour style, but at the same time, is incredibly sick.Directed by Peter Jackson, of 'Lord of the Rings' fame, it is set in New Zealand. It all starts when some fearsome rat-monkey hybrid is captured and brought back from some hot desert like country (can't recall which one) to live in a local zoo. It bites Lionel's mother, Lionel being the central figure and 'hero' in this film. She becomes infected by the deadly venom it carries and promptly falls ill, which is when the film becomes messy. The illness I'm talking about is zombification, which soon spreads through the neighbourhood.This low budget but cult horror movie gives a humorous take on zombies. Instead of the slow moving immobile creatures we've become used to in earlier zombie outings, particularly the original 'Dawn of the Dead', this movie actually gives some of these walking corpses certain amounts of personality. Despite the excessive amounts of blood and gore, a lot of the violence is presented in a deliberately OTT and often comical way, so the viewer would probably finding him or herself laughing or pulling a face rather than being repulsed.The main proportion of the gore/violence comes near the end, when Lionel and afew other survivors are fighting for survival during what looks like an open house party for the undead. Limbs go flying, torso-less corpses walk the stairs, and a fat guy with a huge quiff makes easy work of a horde of zombies using 2 kitchen knives.",Dead Alive

The situations in this film are so absurd that it makes you laugh.  This movie is not for the weak stomach.  It's so gory that it makes you wonder if the actors got sick just working with all of the blood.  Peter Jackson does a wonderful job mixing gore with comedy.

174,aakash-karkare,Interesting . . . .,6,1 November 2010,"Braindead or Dead Alive whatever you want to call it is one of Peter Jackson's earliest movies. Made in 1992 with a very low budget and with his friends doing all the acting it was the movie that made him known to international audiences.Braindead is a horror comedy. It makes you a realise that it isn't taking itself seriously when you see the man's hands and head being chopped of in the start. At that point you would think that you are in for a ride. A very good one at that. But this movie differs from earlier zombie comedies like Return of the Living Dead in that it also tries to engage the audience in sub plots that then distract the viewers and the zombie carnage doesn't start till an hour of this movie is over. It would have been better to focus on the zombies more than the sub plots.However Braindead does add something new to the genre. In this film the character instantly doesn't kill the zombies. He decided to lock them up and feeds them and tries to keep because he says ""They are not dead they are merely rotting."" The acting is nothing to write home about since it is a low budget b - movie but that is what makes the movie so appealing.I sometimes wonder what Peter Jackson thinks of when he looks back at these movies. Does he miss making them with his friends on weekends and having a lot of fun or does he enjoy making big budget movies and has forgotten these ones.Overall Braindead is a decent flick. There is no groundbreaking special effects or story. There is however a lot of gore and it does live up to its sobriquet of goriest film ever made. Though a bit uneven there are a few laughs and there is a sense of goofiness that makes it very enjoyable.",Dead Alive

I was surprised at how good the film was. Although the Gore is fake as hell. It still makes you sick to your stomach.

I don't really know how to approach this film. It's very quirky, and yet it is very violent. It has plenty of doses of comedy and romance: plenty of that for literally the gallons and gallons of blood and guts this movie has in it along with the staggering body count.

Yes, there will probably never be another film quite as gory as this. Yet, gory as it is, it still manages to have a happy, sweet ending. Most of the gore is very cartoonish and ludicrously overdone, which is what makes the film such a treat. You just get to the point where you can't believe they could possible go any farther or get any sicker--then they do. But every bit of horror is capped with a gag of some kind.

So if any of you are complaining because the film is more funny than it is scary, then that's the whole point. Peter Jackson wants you to laugh when you see this movie. If he wanted to frighten you, he'd make the film along the same lines as his other masterpiece HEAVENLY CREATURES.

181,KnightLander,"Proof that ""Rings"" director Jackson is anything but ""Braindead""",8,20 June 2005,"Look up the word ""disgusting"" in the unwritten Book Of The Cinema and you'll find that the definition is ""Peter Jackson's 'Braindead'"". I don't know how else to introduce the picture other than to say that it is believed to be the goriest film ever made, and that it is considered by many to be the best zombie (and even horror in general) film ever made.The film revolves around Lionel (Timothy Balme), a kind-hearted and loyal young man forced to take care of his wicked old mother (Elizabeth Moody). When Lionel meets Paquita (Diana Penalver), a girl working at a local shop (who has been foretold that Lionel is her destined love), a romance blooms - angering Lionel's mum, who proceeds to follow the couple on a trip to the zoo. The story goes from sunny romance to pitch-black horror in an instant when Lionel and Paquita stumble across a bizarre creature in the zoo: the rare Sumatran rat monkey, a vicious little beast with taste for flesh. In the film's first bloody scene - enough to get the film an ""R"" rating already - Lionel's mum is bitten by the rat monkey.Naturally, being the very loving son he is, Lionel takes his sick mother home and gives her his undivided attention. That night Lionel is visited by Paquita, and for a while Lionel forgets about his mum or anything else.From then on Lionel's life becomes a living hell. First, his mother dies. Then, she is resurrected as a zombie and begins losing clumps of skin and an ear. This doesn't seem good, especially when a respected couple arrive for dinner. Soon, friends of the family are bitten, or just nibbled on by Lionel's mum - and so they find themselves brainless, undead creatures as well. Then some of the kind local citizens - including a priest who ""kicks ass for the Lord"" - are zombied. Finally, most of the town has become zombies. Things aren't looking good for Lionel, who's trying to keep the whole thing under wraps - pretty much literally.How much gore could a horror film have if a horror film could have gore? I don't know, but I'd say ""Braindead"" is about the limit. People whose stomachs aren't made of rock should steer clear of this film, or any of Jackson's earlier pieces for that matter. Luckily, I was prepared for the gory festivities after watching ""Bad Taste"", but even then I was surprised when - three minutes into the film - a man finds both his arms and, ultimately, his head cut off in an unflinching scene which gives you no time to blink. If there ever has been a more gory, disgusting, sick film that ""Braindead"" (or ""Dead Alive"", whichever you prefer), I've yet to see it.For example, in one scene, Paquita and Lionel hear Paquita's dog bark and attack Lionel's mum. Rushing upstairs, they find Lionel's mum looking sick. Lionel goes to her and removes one of the dog's legs from her throat. (In case you haven't noticed, this is one of the most disturbing scenes in the film) ""Your mother ate my dog!"" Paquita screams. ""There's still some left,"" Lionel replies. We pull back and find the room splattered in blood, with hairy remains on the bed.Ugh.""Braindead"" is rated highly most everywhere I've seen it reviewed, hailed by horror fans as a masterpiece. It is constantly competing with films like ""Evil Dead II"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" for superiority in the ""Best Zombie Movie Ever"" category. I'd say it comes pretty close too. The film's nightmarish, unflinching atmosphere is something entirely unique to Peter Jackson. The acting is terrific - you feel exactly what you're supposed to feel when you're supposed to feel it. The score, by Peter Dasent, is also very fine, and gives the film a mischievous, comedic mood.""Braindead"" is Peter Jackson's pre-""Rings"" masterpiece, and one of the greatest horror films ever made. If you, a) have a very endurant stomach, b) call yourself a horror fan, and c) haven't a fear of rat monkeys, then this is the film for you.

189,accattone74,Blood at 5 Gallons/Second,10,16 November 2010,"Zombies. Love 'em or hate 'em, but they're here to stay. That's something every living man and/or woman in a zombie film has to learn to deal with. Most folks fight and almost always lose, but occasionally there's the bold soul who gambles, trying an alternative and non- violent approach. Take Lionel, for instance - the hero of Dead Alive. Lionel uses a weapon against zombies that few have dared to use before – denial. And at first it's quite effective, albeit in a disturbing yet hilarious way, but only at first. Unfortunately, Lionel, like most pacifists, must learn the hard way that violence is the only way out of a zombie holocaust— besides death. If Lionel had been braver earlier on, perhaps the eventual massacre of innocents would never have happened, but how many of you could kill your own mother to prevent such a thing? Dead Alive has everything that a solid piece of entertainment should: side-splitting comedy, tear-jerking drama, heart-pounding romance, tarot cards, custard, hot glue, necrophilia, a homicidal toddler, farting, barfing, dismemberment, a lawnmower, undead hordes, a disturbing Oedipal complex, and more blood & gore than any other film ever made, before or since.Dead Alive was the third feature directed by Peter ""My Precious"" Jackson, after his debut film, the alien invasion shockfest Bad Taste, and the all-animal Muppet/puppet porno/musical Meet the Feebles. Yes, I said porno/musical. If you haven't seen it, put aside whatever you're doing tomorrow and rent it. Any film whose tagline is ""Hell hath no fury like a hippo with a machine-gun!"" must be a classic, and it is. In my previous existence as a video store clerk, I can't tell you how many times I'd leave my store's cover-misleading copy of Feebles in the children's section just to see if any parents would rent it, and they often did. The final blow-out in Dead Alive belongs to that cinematic echelon of gross-fests occupied only by those similarly gut-wrenching scenes in Evil Dead, Re-Animator, Romero's Dawn and Day (of the Dead), Scarface, The Beyond, etc. However, it is Dead Alive that holds the record for most blood spilled in a film: 300 liters in the ending alone.

But this movie ties the three themes together superbly.  It is all at once the most gory movie I have ever seen, one of the funniest movies I have seen, and one of the most enchantingly romantic movies I have ever seen.  Only Peter Jackson could have melded these three genres together so successfully.  The actors are all just fantastic - you really root for poor Lionel and Paquita, and even old Uncle Les to triumph against the forces of evil.  I should also mention that the sountrack is fantastic, always perfectly setting the mood for the scene it accompanies. If you like Evil Dead 2, make sure to see this one - it goes beyond the dual genre whammy of ED2 and adds in a really compelling romance plot as well. Then once you have become a Peter Jackson fan, go and see Bad Taste, the film that started it all!",Dead Alive
193,d-maxsted,Peter Jacksons King Kong Of Horror (With Tongue In Cheek),10,1 May 2011,"Before 'King Kong"" before ""The Lovely Bones"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Peter Jackson was nothing less than the master of gore,he pulled out all the stops and wasn't afraid to be as explicit as he could to shock the audience with buckets or blood and entrails yet at the same time make sure his audience had the best roller-coaster ride of their lives while in the theatre. Speaking as a 100 percent Kiwi I like so many thousands of other New Zealanders knew the world stage was beckoning after the release of this classic,in New Zealand we knew this movie simply as ""Brain Dead"" although the title was changed for American and overseas audiences I can tell you not many directors say a handful have ever dared to be so graphic on the big screen,yet Peter Jackson did so and the world took notice,read a few of the reviews from people who have seen this movie and you can tell that even now it continues to delight and thrill. In its release the faces of so many well known New Zealand actors,mostly from our television screens showing up to be either torn apart or to have their hearts ripped from their chest was such a hoot,audiences were howling in the theatres plus with a dought 'Brain Dead' contains probably the finest and funniest moment in cinema history of a priest showing what other skills he has apart from being able to hold mass every Sunday,and his now classic line ""I Kick Arse For The Lord"" had us all rolling in the isles. If you haven't seen it but read a review before doing so with any such movie of the genre I kid you not,this is one of if not the best example of what happens when a master film maker does things his or her way...the result is magic.",Dead Alive

Old woman is bitten there, she gets sick and dies, but she comes back to life as a zombie, killing and eating dogs... nurses, friends, and neighbors. Main characters are her son Lionel and his girlfriend Paquita. Timothy Balme and Diana Penalver are perfect actors for that roles. As film goes it seams filmmakers delivered in every way. It is horror, and most hilarious horror at all times.I've watched this film more than 60 times, probably every 4 months since it's released :) And every time I'm more and more impressed.If you are fan of this genre, and if you missed somehow this film... don't wait one minute longer.

197,shuklavinash,The twisted world of Sir Peter Jackson,10,4 October 2012,"'Braindead' as the name suggests, is a zombie film. But wait! This doesn't make it like any other zombie film. In fact this is the powerhouse of a splatter! As a gatekeeper of the cinema hall, I request all the haters of gore go home and welcome all those who love the twisted tale of splatter and walking innards that set history in the world of splatter. People had seen gore before 'Braindead' was released, but what sets this one apart from the other gore films is that 'Braindead' falls into the 'comedy horror' genre. Since it's no disturbing stuff, the lovers of splatter may revel this twisted tale for years together.The film begins with the scene of Skull Island, where we come across a New Zealand zoo-officer (Bill Ralston) who has dared catch a Sumatran Monkey with the help of local guides and poachers. The spear-wielding tribal inhabitants show unwelcoming attitude towards the intruders and follow them. Fortunately they happen to take the monkey along, but the zoo-officer gets bitten. The poachers lose no time in decapitating and beheading the helpless zoo-officer for his sole good, for they fear that the monkey's bite would transform him into something bizarre! The monkey reaches Wellington and is kept in a zoo.Cut to Wellington, we meet a young man Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme), who lives with his over-possessive, domineering, and snobbish mother Vera (Elizabeth Moody). Vera loves making Lionel work for hours together and keeps him engaged in several odd jobs. It so happens that Lionel begins his first affair with a dashing Spanish belle Paquita (Diana Peñalver) and the two decide to visit a local zoo. Vera is suspicious about Lionel's objectives and follows them. Unfortunately, Vera gets bitten by the same Sumatran Monkey and Lionel somehow brings her home.Vera objects to this relationship calling Lionel irresponsible and unapologetic. The next day the bite begins showing its effect and Vera dies. Moments later we see Vera's corpse animating back to life, but this time she has become more like a rotting corpse or more precisely a zombie. Lionel somehow believes that his mother could be cured and does everything to keep her alive. The townspeople believe that Vera has died and gather at her funeral. That night Lionel visits her grave and exhumes Vera's corpse. He is hampered by a pack of hooligans who think he is a body snatcher and beat him mercilessly. Vera's corpse comes out of the grave and infects the hooligans and a priest Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie). In order to hide his mother's tale, Lionel has to make arrangements for all the zombies at the basement of his palatial house, he has inherited from his family. But his uncle Les (Ian Watkin) has his own plans about this inheritance. How Paquita and Lionel try to reunite against all the odds and fight away a pack of several hundred zombies forms the crux of the story.'Braindead' is a perfect splatter entertainer in all sense. The film captures some of the more bizarre and disgorging images that may leave the viewers in discomfort. I think they spent most of the budget on fake blood because gore and splatter are the ingredients that set the viewers' mood. Also, it has some of the wittiest dialogs I've ever enjoyed listening to. I remember I liked Tom Holland's 'Fright Night' for its witty dialogs and its credibility as a next door tale. 'Braindead' too is close to any other credible next door tale, except that Lionel's house is the home of raging and murderous zombies. Now there are zombies of all age and sizes and Lionel's interaction with them is more of a spectacle. The scene where Lionel deals with the zombie baby is ludicrous and a great stress buster. People may berate this one for its offensive imagery, I still say that gore hounds and the admirers of bizarre and twisted have an ample scope to quench their thirst! So before planning to watch this one, here is a sample for you:Paquita: (Screaming) Your mother ate my dog!Lionel: (Taking dog's fur out of Vera's mouth)...Not all of it!",Dead Alive

199,Nic673,One of the Best Horror Movies of 90's,9,7 September 1999,"Dead Alive ranks up there with Silence of The Lambs, Candyman, and Scream for the best horror movies of the 90's. This is probably one of the most entertaining horror movies I've seen in this decade. Dead Alive is by far one of the goreiest in cinema history. It`s almost like a tame Anime come to life. The plot and the acting is above average. While people say Dawn of the Dead or Evil Dead are much better movies. This film is definitly one of my all time favorite horror movies. Peter Jackson`s twisted trilogy of films (Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Dead Alive) are much better and smarter than any of those Kevin Williamson teen generated casting of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Dawson`s Creek, and Party of Five films.   Even if I am teenager, I still hate all of these stupid teen horror and most of the other genre, too. Dead Alive is masterpiece, that should be on the level of Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. It does have lot frights, but it still remains very entertaining. From watching and hearing about all of these teen generated films, there probably won`t be any films like Dead Alive or Night of Living Dead coming to a theater near you anytime soon.",Dead Alive

Lionel finds love for the first time (well love found him), But his crazy mum wants him to care for her. In the process of tracking him down on his secret date she is bitten by the accursed Sumatran rat monkey. Chaos and hilarity ensues involving A disgruntled Kung Fu priest, zombies f******, a zombie baby, and one good use for a lawn mower.

I laughed so hard while watching this movie that my stomach hurt. It is an all out blood fest. As sick as this movie is, it does have a storyline to it and you will just smile through the entire film. I would have never thought this was made in 1992. It feels like an early 80's type of flick. From the rat monkey, to the mom, to the zombie baby, to the priest, it is terrific. The lawnmower scene and the mother at the end is the best. This is a must see for any fan of gore.",Dead Alive

Or the remake of Texas Chain-Saw Massacre. Like in Texas Chain-Saw Massacre it was only 5% of the violence in This film.. but it was more realistic. If it had even 20% of the violence in this film and was still realistic... It would have never been released. If it had good special effects... people would have to sue for psychological damage. People would be in tears screaming throughout the movie. And I still can't believe this is the early work of the director of Lord Of the Rings. I didn't believe it until I saw it right here on IMDb... I still don't fully believe it. This movie almost made me puke a few times. No movie has ever done that to me, ever.

If you were lucky enough to see this one at the theaters, then you would know that the viewing experience is even crazier with all the contagious laughter coming from the audience.

Peter Jackson's genius ---- also evidenced in his previous splatter films BAD TASTE and MEET THE FEEBLES ---- is that he makes true horror; this is a movie so incredibly sick and gruesome that it is actually more funny than it is scary or disturbing. Timothy Balme as Lionel seems like the kind of role that would have been played by Jeffrey Combs, had he been a New Zealand native. Lionel lives in constant servitude to his horrid mother (Elizabeth Moody, who was also brilliantly cast as one of the Sackville-Bagginses in Jackson's THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, but cut out of the theatrical cut). I could ramble on about the greatness of this film ---- which includes zombie sex and parenting, face removal, animated intestines (that means they're moving, not cartoons), the ever-present and disturbing maternal metaphor, and the infamous lawnmower scene ---- but I don't want to ruin it for the poor, deprived souls who haven't seen it yet.

206,CTS-1,"Oh, God, I Love This Movie!",10,22 August 2006,"This film is truly the finest hour of the young, aggressive, full-speed-ahead Peter Jackson. Check your squeamishness at the door and get ready for proof that splatter can be played for laughs.Not all the laughs are splatter-based. The opening scene shows a zookeeper waving a permit to a tribe of hostile natives about to kill him, shouting out ""per-mit! Per-mit!"" From there, the film descends into the inspired, amused lunacy of the splatstick. Look for the cameo of a young, thin Peter Jackson as a mortician's assistant. Also look for the minor hilarious characters- the Nazi vet, the idiot football player, and most famous of all, Father MacGruder, he of the film's best one-liner.Timothy Balme is excellent as the nebbishy mama's boy who ends up taking on the whole undead world by himself, with a couple of mechanical aids. He out-Ashes Ash! Like any good zombie film, the end features waves of zombies, but many with unique and twisted personalities of their own. The best is, of course, zombie baby. It is shocking and yet hilarious to see what zombie baby endures, and yet survives (perhaps to live on in the long awaited sequel?) Ten stars, and five out of five blood splats thrown up against the wall (during the last half hour).",Dead Alive
207,MoffatLP,Hilarious Horror Entertainment,8,5 January 2012,"A lot of people I talk to are unaware of Braindead/Dead Alive. When I mention this is one of Peter Jackson's first films they automatically assume it will be like his Lord of the Rings trilogy. No, this is unlike anything else Jackson has ever done. Probably my favourite zombie movie of all time and one of my favourite horror movies altogether, Braindead is an absolute blast to watch.Braindead takes place in a small town in New Zealand. The film is about an old woman who gets bitten my a Sumatran Rat Monkey, composed of dreaded stop-motion effects. Soon after being bitten she dies but returns from the dead as a zombie. The woman runs around infecting (and sometimes eating) dogs, neighboors, and friends and family. It is only up to her socially awkward son Lionel to stop her. Along to help Lionel is his girlfriend he meets days before.Braindead contains some of the most hilarious scenes of all time. There is one scene of a zombie baby being tossed around in a park as residents look in horror at what Lionel is doing to this baby of his. Of course it isn't his baby though, it is the baby of two zombies. How did they end up having this baby? Take a guess. While everyone else is watching Lionel beat this baby off of poles and such, there is a drunken guy who is cheering him on.A lot of the characters who put the comedy into the film didn't have very big roles at all. As mentioned before, the homeless drunk in the park has little to know role in the film whatsoever and is mainly there for comedy. But sometimes it isn't the characters who aren't funny, it's the scenes themselves. Kind of like when a priest is fighting a bunch of zombies using martial arts. Or one of the most gruesome scenes of all time when the main character slices zombies up with a lawnmower.Unlike a lot of other zombie movies, this one didn't have a dark feel to it. It was actually a feel good movie. But it was hard to take seriously over the comedy. However there are some emotionally intense scenes in it. Point is, don't expect to take this very seriously because you aren't getting a serious movie.It's a classic and there is no doubt about it. Can you go wrong with zombie movies? Not really. The scenes were classic. They were incredibly hilarious and always make me laugh. The costume designs were terrible but great at the same time while the stop motion effects were just plain awesome. If you want to have an awesome time or don't want to think too much and have some fun then watch this movie.",Dead Alive

So I stumbled across Braindead. Saw a rating of 7+ and was willing to watch it. I also never thought that zombie flicks can be bad. I always thought that somehow the movie would be at least a time-pass. I was wrong. This is the worst zombie flick ever. Worse than ""Shawn of the dead"". Half wit story, half wit acting and fully mental gore scenes. I mean who wrote this crap? OK a few scenes were really funny, but why would anyone have zombies at his home, and feed them dinner? And how did his mother become so big at the end. I mean I just want to go back in the past and undo this. Those huge nipples from the last scenes still haunt me. For true Zombie flick fans, please skip this. And for people who voted anything more than 4. Please first get an idea of what a zombie movie should be, you can try ""Dawn of the dead"", ""Night of the living dead"" and for even more beginners, just watch Micheal Jackson's thriller videos. One last word of advice, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. Yeah somethings should be buried, like all copies of this movie.I almost forgot the most memorable moment from this movie....

It also succeeded in being a hilarious, twisted, over-the-top coming of age story.Right from the start, it is clear that this movie does not take itself seriously.  The characters are goofy, there are stereotypes galore, and it falls to nearly every cliche of B-rated zombie flicks.  Except it's clear from the level of visual effects that this movie did not have a tiny budget. I highly recommend this movie.  It was written and directed by Peter Jackson (yes, the director of the amazing Lord of the Rings), and it is obvious that he knows this genre and is skilled at making his audience laugh and vomit at the same time.

I don't really like gory movies, but I like them if they're funny (i.e. ""Shaun of the Dead""). As things progressed, the special effects just sort of took on a life of their own. Pay close attention to the entrails...ROFLMAO! Seriously. How the h-e-double-hockey- sticks did they do that????? Now the reasoning behind my being totally enthralled with the special effects is this movie was filmed in 1992--long before the invention of CGI or anything of that nature. ""Some"" of it was cheesy, but honestly, by the time the movie had moved on to the real grime and gore, it amazed me that they didn't use REAL, uh--don't want to spoil this-- ""stuff.""

Admittedly it is kind of slow near the beginning but when things get rolling in my opinion they really get good. Re-watching it I started to wonder how I sat through it so well as a child. Truthfully I love horror movies and not much can make me feel sick, but some scenes in this movie really had my stomach turning. And let me tell you it had nothing to do with the gallons of blood they were pouring out. Although my memory from childhood was a little fuzzy on what took place in the movie, it did remember that there was something very BIG at the end. My memory held up and it definitely wasn't wrong.

Normally, such material would make good fodder for unwatchable late night garbage or Mystery Science Theater 3000. In the hands of Peter Jackson, however, Dead Alive is a horror-comedy gem that manages to go right over the line of absurdity and still be glorious entertainment.Poor Lionel is suffering from severe insecurity. When a ""Sumatran Rat Monkey"" arrives in his picturesque New Zealand hometown, undead chaos ensues. Thus, it's up to Lionel to blossom and save the day. In the process, he just might become a hero. Equally interesting characters are Lionel's obscene uncle, his Hispanic girlfriend Paquita and the scores of uniquely revolting zombies which require dismemberment.Be warned, the gore, no matter how whimsical, is unmatched by few others.

(Not the US Dead Alive version)I don't even know where to start, so without giving up some of the best parts, I guess I'll start with a bit of the plot:  A severely repressed man who lives with his overbearing mother and is in love with the local grocer girl is forced to deal with; first his mother becoming a Zombie, then a bunch of other people becoming Zombies, then his thoroughly disgusting uncle throwing a party in the Zombie infested house.If someone asked me to describe this movie in one word, it would be 'funny'. Either that or 'clever'.  I think there are a number of homage's paid to older horror flicks, including Hitchcock (Psycho) and Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead etc...) but any references are done in a truly unique and funny way.  I laughed out loud a number of times (but then I am a little twisted).There are some very surprising scenes, which may turn many viewers off and quite a few disgusting scenes, mostly towards the end, but I quickly became desensitized to the grotesque aspects of this film and completely enjoyed it for what it is: A Zombie Movie.  The main Zombie plot, while being fairly unique, doesn't stand up to modern science.  But while watching the movie, I really didn't care because it allowed for some really funny scenes, especially the scenes revolving around animal tranquilizers and poison.  For uniqueness (which is missing from most Zombie movies that I've seen) I rate the Plot at a solid 7.5/10.Having seen Jackson's first film, BAD TASTE, the acting in Braindead was surprisingly good.  There are no Oscar performances, but overall, for the genre acting was a solid 8/10.Special effects, for the day and age were very good - 8/10Direction was excellent, Peter Jackson balanced camp with drama, humour and visual action.  I don't know how he did it.  I really don't... 8/10Overall I'd say this film scores a solid 8/10",Dead Alive
222,movieswithmitch,One of the greatest Horror movies ever!,10,12 November 2010,"Unfortunately, to review this movie I'm going to employ one of the most overly used review phrases but I can think of no better way to describe Peter Jackson's comedy-horror classic, ""Dead Alive"", but as a ""tour-de-force"" in blood, guts, and gore! Jackson's flawless film is an amazing achievement not only in horror, being maybe the goriest film ever, but in cinema as a whole. Superbly crafted, Jackson goes for broke, perfecting sickening sight gag after sickening sight gag with the help of off the chart gore effects from Richard Taylor and prosthetics by Bob McCarron. On top of that, there are wonderful performances all wrapped in a love-letter look at 1950's New Zealand, all making ""Dead Alive"" the ""Casablanca"" of horror.Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) is a bumbling momma's boy who becomes romantically entangled with the enchanting Paquita (Diana Penalver). While Lionel's overbearing mum (Elizabeth Moody) is spying on their first date at the zoo, mum gets bit by the cursed Sumatran rat-monkey. Shortly there after, mum dies but doesn't stay dead, coming back to life eating everything alive, including Paquita's dog in a spectacular gross-out scene. Mum wreaks havoc on the town, making zombies out of the nurse, a gang of greasers, a kung-fu priest, and half the rest of the town which culminates in an orgy of a bloody climax that has no rival in any other film. It's up to Lionel to choose between his mass murdering mother or saving the day and getting the girl. ""Dead Alive"" is a masterpiece of horror that does no wrong. You will do no wrong by watching this film as soon as possible!﻿",Dead Alive

There have been a very small handful of movies I actually enjoyed, but mostly, the writing is terrible, and the acting is even worse. Dead Alive, or Braindead though. Holy sh*t. I put off watching this movie for so many years. I don't know whether its because I don't generally enjoy kiwi movies, or because I didn't think I could give it the watch it deserves, but now that I have seen it, I think it is maybe the best movie New Zealand has produced. As a gore fan, I rarely see a movie that makes me uneasy. Sure, a lot of the movies in the 80s were pretty gory, but nothing like Dead Alive. This was an absolute gore-fest, and probably the goriest movie I've ever watched. Aside from that though, the actors, the writing, and the photography are all brilliant. Will definitely watch again, and will definitely recommend.",Dead Alive

Though there is a lot of fanfare about this title now that Peter Jackson is a recognizable name, it's not Peter's name attached that makes this a great film in it's genre. Before watching this, I thought ""Oh well, if it's terrible, it's only 97 minutes of my life and I can get some work done while I watch""... After the first 20 minutes or so, I never decided break from the movie.This is a film that employs so many zombie clichés that it's really incredible. It creates new ones that have been used by other films, and exploits zombie pre-1992 scenes for excellent comic (and general shock) effect. As you begin to think you've seen the last over-the-top effect or idea, it only gets more incredible. The turning and kill scenes really get more and more insanely campy, but in the best of ways. You can feel the ballistic gel squishing. You can hear the hand-in-the-turkey foley art... Classic! Then it has the audacity to try to create familial drama after you are already invested in the extreme campiness. Imagine Evil Dead, but GOOD!

226,SmashMonkey,DO NOT eat before you watch it,10,21 August 2006,"this has to be the sickest, most disturbed, gore-filled movie of all time, so naturally, i love it! despite a slow start, there is more zombie action than you can shake a lawnmower at. all the roles are perfectly understated, which just makes them more believable (if you can believe in zombie sex) and the gross-out gags just keep coming. it's impossible to be scared watching this film, it's just too funny. i don't know if it's true, but i've been told that this is the goriest film ever made, which i could well believe. Lionel is a great character and an unlikely hero, but mother steals the show. after being bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey, she falls ill and soon dies, only to return as a zombie who REALLY likes to have her friends for dinner! Lionel soon has a house full of undead guests, who he tries (unsuccessfully) to hide from his new girlfriend Paquita and the rest of the town. just when it seems that things can't get any more bizarre, one of the zombies (mother's nurse) gives birth to Selwyn, the ugliest baby you could ever meet, zombie or otherwise. then, just to cap it all, the lecherous, money-grabbing Uncle Les shows up, determined to get his hands on his sister's money and house. of course, it wouldn't be complete without a party, and Les and his friends oblige. however, it's going to take more than a doorman to get rid of their party-crashers! finishing with hilarious, riotous scenes of utter carnage, this is one film not to be missed. i am the only woman i know who has watched this film, which is a great pity. if you love horror, or are just looking for the perfect antidote to Bridget Jones, put this one on your shopping list.",Dead Alive
227,The_Vigilante,The Goriest Film Ever Made,7,4 July 2001,"When you mention the name Peter Jackson you immediately think, 'he's the guy who's directing that Lord of the Rings film ain't he?!'. Though this is a valid statement what you should also know is that he has made a few very horrific films before. You may remember 'Meet the Feebles' (yes, the puppet film) or the infamous 'Bad Taste'. But these films in no way compare to the gore that is contained in Braindead.The introduction is a very memorable experience, a zoologist is in search of a 'rat monkey' with the help of a few islanders. Though he manages to capture one of these creatures he is bitten by it during his escape. Once bitten by one of these creatures it turns you into a zombie (you know the drill), so the only possible way to stop this is to cut of the contaminated limb. Unfortunately for the zoologist this turns out to be his hand, arm and head. So off they come with a rusty axe and shouts of 'synguya' by the islanders.Without going into great depths to explain the story, heres the main outline: the hero of the story, Lionel, goes to the zoo on a date. His very clingy mother follows him secretly. Mother gets bitten by the Rat Monkey thats in the zoo. Mother starts to change, infects most of the town, they change into zombies, Lionel takes it upon himself to save the day by killing the zombies in the most tongue-in-cheek style you're ever likely to see. Sounds ingenious doesn't it??!!OK, its not much of a story but thats not the reason you'll be watching it or have watched it. Of course, the only reason really to watch this film is so you can be completely grossed out by the amount of blood and gore that this film is made up of. Oh, and there are other good reasons aswell, these include zombie sex, a zombie baby called Celwin and intestines with a mind of its own. Undoubtedly you'll find something else you like about this film, but be warned it is definitely not for the faint of heart.",Dead Alive

The R-rated version is the best argument for proponents of the anti-censorship movement.  It's nearly unwatchable.  The uncut version is a modern day classic, effectively parodying horror films while enthralling us with likable characters, multi-level plotting, ingenious black humor, and exceptional special effects.  This is Peter Jackson's horror-comedy masterpiece, a slight step above his earlier film Bad Taste (not to knock that film one bit).

Director Peter Jackson throws in anything and everything imaginable in this no-holds-barred comical gorefest, and with an unbelievably thought out plot, it all connects together.  The story is about a mama's boy who finally gets a date, but when ""mum"" finds out about his little romance with an attractive cashier, she is filled with jealousy and sets out to ruin his love life, getting bitten by a cursed Samatran Rat Monkey in the process.  After ""the bite,"" she literally begins to decompose right before her nerdy son's eyes, and soon, she turns into the most hideous looking zombie ever, mutilating and decapitating anybody in sight.  Soon, hungry and rabid zombies are everything in the house, and it's up to Lionel to put a stop to them, in one of the most bizarre and disgusting endings I've ever seen in my entire life, and for sure, in the history of movie making.  If you have a cast-iron stomach and love gore movies or just love to laugh yourself silly, then this is the ultimate gorefest for you, and without a doubt, the ""last word in horror films.""

232,chuckc,"Jackson Evicerates His Antecedents in ""Dead Alive""",6,31 July 2005,"Before Peter Jackson became a ""respected"" director with ""Heavenly Creatures,"" and an Oscar winner for ""Lord of the Rings,"" he made slapstick gore flicks. He was New Zealand's answer to Sam Raimi (who also went on to better things).""Dead Alive"" is New Zealand's ""Evil Dead""--all it lacks is Bruce Campbell (and there is one character, a butt-kicking priest, who bears more than a passing resemblance to the big-chinned Bruce). The plot is essentially this: A ""rat monkey"" bites the bitter old Mum of a milquetoast named Lionel. Mum becomes an undead ghoul who feasts on human flesh. Her bite turns other people into ghouls, etc. (I think you can fill in the rest.) Will Lionel stand up to his Mum and save his girlfriend from almost certain ghouldom? Rent the flick and find out.This is a fairly entertaining movie if you're in a particular frame of mind--think ""The Three Stooges Meet the Living Dead""--but, boy, are Jackson's influences showing. The look of the ghouls, not to mention the plot of the movie, recalls Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" pictures. One character, Lionel's sleazy uncle, even refers to ""total bodily dismemberment"" as the only way to kill ghouls (this is a direct quote from ""Evil Dead""--the uncle even acknowledges that he heard this in a movie). The ghoul attacks recall George Romero's ""Living Dead"" flicks; even the idea of a disease that causes its victims to become homicidal maniacs is derived from Romero's ""The Crazies.""Yes, Jackson's antecedents are definitely showing, but he does ratchet up the gore. In ""Evil Dead II,"" Bruce Campbell straps a chainsaw onto the stub of his wrist to slice up ghouls; in ""Dead Alive,"" Lionel straps a lawnmower to his chest and purees the monsters (simple dismemberment isn't quite enough). But, as derivative as it is, slapstick gore fans will probably enjoy ""Dead Alive,"" even though Raimi's movies are funnier (and he has Bruce Campbell).",Dead Alive
233,YugoNinja,A true pearl in a sea of mediocrity,10,27 March 2007,"I've seen a lot of gore-splatter-horror movies and I mean a LOT. And Brain Dead is pure genius. Probably because it is not pure gore but more of a comedy. Jackson really knows how to make a good cocktail. And what a cocktail of blood and laughs is this! The zoom-ups, the camera angles, the lines! Love it or hate it, you can't ignore it. Most people don't like it because it is gruesome, bloody, revolting, stomach-turning. But you have to appreciate the genius of Jackson of toning it down with a great sense of humor characteristic of all his early flicks. I always liked horror movies that didn't take everything so seriously. You know, the dark, brutal shockers that are labeled as horrors only because of a few slasher scenes and a pair of tits. Brain Dead is nothing of that. If you want to scare your friends, your little brother or your girlfriend don't bother renting it. This movie is to watch with your friends with a few beers. Fun and laughs are guaranteed. And those who aren't acquainted with Jackson's pre-LOTR work will never believe you when you will tell them this man actually won a ""few"" Oscars.

234,Pal_Joey,Braindead indeed,5,31 October 2005,"This movie is for people who like gore. Mindnumbing scene after scene of gore. Also bad acting comes into play, particularly with the film lead as Lionel. Seems like a lot of performances are at the Benny Hill level of comedy, with lots of signaling ""THIS IS FUNNY- LOOK AT MY MUGGING"" sort of thing. I like films with plot, character and nuance such as Scream, Wait Until Dark or Silence of the Lambs. This is not one of them. I do admire some of the camera work and techniques- and as mentioned in more favorable reviews, the kungfu scene with the priest is a classic. The start of the film is promising with an Indiana Jones-like escape with the Rat of Summatra from a locale used in Lord of the Rings. A later scene of the rat in the zoo is very low-budget. The last half of the film becomes repetitively gory- the dead are indeed alive and won't go away. I found it boring in the end.",Dead Alive

It might be alright if you're sitting around with a bunch of your juvenile friends (or you're under the age of 13 yourself) or your tripping or just looking for the ultimate b-movie gore-fest, but unless you fall into one of the aforementioned categories don't waste your time with this lame flick.

But I'm glad they did, as this is one of the most irreverent films ever made.Peter Jackson's King Kong fascination is revealed by the start of the film on Skull Island, and like his recent remake, this takes a while to get going. Interestingly Jackson also used the location in a much more sombre scene in Return of the King.Then there is an introduction to the characters: the crazy mother, the unassuming hero, Lionel, and the plucky Paquita. Afterwards there are some comic moments as the now-undead mother (and later, the infamous kung-fu priest, the nurse and the biker dude) are being looked after by Lionel in his mini-zombie nursing home. Then there is the reappearance of Lionel's uncle - another great character - and soon after, the zombies are all over Lionel's house. From here on, it's just a non-stop barrage of limbs, blood, entrails and the cringe-worthy dismemberment manoeuvres that precede them.From a single viewing, I'd guess that about 80% of the budget must have been for fake blood substitute, but it's still a better use of money than paying 1/10 of Tom Cruise's salary ;-) There are downsides: the plot is adjusted to fit the scenes, it feels like the movie has too little action in the first half and too much in the second half, and if you take away the slapstick and initial shock at how far it pushes the boundaries, it is actually not that hilarious.",Dead Alive

All I'm gonna say is this ranks as my number 5 favorite Zombie film (check out my review for 28 Days Later to see my top ten) ever. It's starts out as a goofy comedy with great gross-out gore (I love the rat-monkey stop motion) and escalates into an all out zombie fest at the end, with our hero, Lionel (Timothy Balme) in full Ash/Evil Dead 2 mode (only instead of a chainsaw for an arm, he slaughters the living dead with an old lawn mower tied around his torso). The zombie baby scenes are particularly funny... and I think they are only in the unrated version because I don't remember them in the far inferior R-rated version... definitely watch this one unrated.

It is nice to see that some time in his life, Peter Jackson directed a film that was short, and simple. The story is the same basic romantic comedic formula geek falls in love with girl, and geek wants to be in a relationship but for some reason has to overcome obstacles to be with the girl. In this case, Peter Jackson uses this formula for a zombie horror film and tried something different which is always great to see in a movie.The film however does have it's faults. The acting to say the least was not at all great, I think Lionel was hard to like, and every time his face came on the screen he looked as if he had just wet his pants. In addition there were so many characters, and one after the other kept coming and coming and it was hard to keep track of them. What was even more frustrating was how the zombies kept coming back after being killed multiple times. And it's never fully explained why the mother at the very end turns into a giant 50 foot monster while the other zombies stay the same height, but are just a little bit faster.It is not a film for the squeamish. It is a film for a horror movie freak with a sick unquenchable thirst for blood and carnage. Although a Horror Freak such as myself can sit through the film and watch as Lionel takes a lawn mower and slaughters an entire zombie party. The gore and special effects are corny for me, but completely grotesque for the people who I had forced to watch the film with me.I enjoyed this movie because it is a horror film with great cinematography, editing, special effects, and story. If you enjoy horror films then go for it, but if you are not skip it and when the zombies come, and have a zombie baby that is very creepy and troublesome you'll have no idea how to handle the situation.",Dead Alive

Are you kidding me?? So it belongs to the same category as the exorcist and the shining? ... and to warn people about the fact that if you are not among the craziest fans of slasher movies genre, this movie can ruin your night just like it ruined mine. Right off the bat, the movie lets you know that it does not take itself seriously with a few absurd scenes where the cheapest special effects and absurd dialogues rule. It goes downhill from there, although at this point one can already ask oneself "" how worse can it get?""..well much worse...it goes from abysmal acting, to stupid plots and ends with the lamest and most gratuitous and distasteful gory images that one will ever come across. I don't care much if this is the type of film that Peter Jackson wanted to make,the point is: it's just a terrible movie and as such it does not deserve such a high rating which is probably due to the fact that the director have since then made movies such as The lord of the rings trilogy, kingkong and DIstrict 9 which I considered to be masterpieces but will not retroactively excuse such utter mess and disgrace that Braindead represents.

Be sure to get the unrated DVD, not the r rated version, because much of the gore is cut out.

251,moviedoors,Symphonies of Sickness,9,14 May 2007,"Dead Alive (or Braindead if you like) is bar none one of the most balls out, over the top, will-do-anything to get a reaction, blood and innards splattered movies ever made. In fact, this might just take the cake for being the most gloriously ridiculous Zombie film that at least these eyes have ever scene. This movie is like Evil Dead II on angel dust.When a bizarre rat monkey (anyone else thing that ""world's ugliest dog"" winner is a dead ringer for this thing?) infects poor momma's boy Loinel's overbearing mother, all sorts of hell breaks loose with Lionel trying to keep a basement full of zombies under control.There is no way to be indifferent to this movie. You will most assuredly be repulsed. I pride myself on having seen some pretty intense films that have drastically raised my tolerance for this sort of thing, but yet I still cannot bring myself to watch a scene involving a bowl of pudding featuring an extra ingredient. Those who only know Peter Jackson via his excellent Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong remake are in for a shock.The climax of this movie contains unheard of amounts of blood. Faces are peeled off, intestines have a serpentine life of their own, and there's a lawnmower as weapon scene clearly invoked to one up a certain chainsaw wielding deadite slayer. These scenes are so over the top that you have two choices: vomit or laugh hysterically. Hell, you might even vomit and laugh at the same time and wouldn't that be something? You'd be telling people about that for years!",Dead Alive
252,cgaela,cool,7,12 August 2002,"**minor spoilers**This is a cool movie. This is not the goriest movie ever made. Evil dead has more gore than this. That could just be because I got the cut version and missed out on a lot more but it was still an awesome movie. THat karate fighting preacher was awesome and had some cool lines and the thing with the lawn mower was awesome. Plus, I also loved how that baby laughed. There are so many greats parts in this movie I can't say all of them. People should definitely see this. By they way, I could never find PJ as the morgue's assistant. When was that?",Dead Alive

The movie is a triumph of blood and bodies dismembered, but not for a moment I felt really disgusted (try to watch nekromantik, that is anyway a movie I liked). I was captured by the creativity in the use of the body parts. The only critics someone could move to this movie are about its not being scary and for my personal taste for not very appropriate music.

Anyway, my point.. I'm surprised at so any 10's, but I loved this film the first time I saw it and find it amusing that someone said it was a waste of a rental when I just bought it for £2 on the market today, knowing I had bagged a great deal :P Contrary to what a few people have said here, when I first saw it I thought the special effects were great. I think the effects vary from crappy and stupid (laughable, enjoyably) to incredibly real and slick looking, that in some odd way remind me of The Frightners. Maybe its something to do with Jackson's obvious eye for effects and movement. I didn't really get Bad Taste, but here I thought the story was really fun and interesting and moved at the right pace. I especially love the bit near the end with Lionel and the lawnmower. I think it's the acting and shooting style that make it funny, Uncle Les and the baby are genius and the whole feel is just really lighthearted and slapstick, with a bit of weird thrown in. I think maybe people who don't like it are taking it too seriously, or should go and watch What lies Beneath or something... I guess the style is similar to Evil Dead, but I don't really like makings comparisons. I don't even do it subconsciously, every film is new story to me. Maybe that's why I don't usually prefer the mainstream features, too much smash hits and not enough effort, with too many comparisons. Austrailian/NZ accents are always funnier than American anyway let's be honest :P I reckon Americans think Aus actors are corny and bad, but its just the way they talk! The setting for the film I thought was pretty creepy as I do most films set in ye olden times. Well I don't want to go on too much, but if you like horror/comedies and aren't too picky about affects and embrace any cheese with a smile then you'll love it.",Dead Alive
255,sullymazda,Guaranteed...can't miss,10,7 April 2017,"I've always wondered why, exactly, this motion picture takes place in 1957 (Peter Jackson makes sure it's virtually the first thing you see). I was born that year so...well, I know a thing or two when it comes to Old School. Trust me here... There is not one single solitary blooper in the film..you know, a model of car that doesn't belong there, verbal expressions that people didn't use back then, etc. As they would say...""You get my drift"". Hey, there's one from the fifties! Anyhow... The film operates flawlessly as a period piece..and must have been extremely difficult to make. Think about it. It can't be easy ensuring that we don't see, in the background, someone driving a brand new Corvette, or even a fancy kind of pay phone could not possibly have existed in 1957. People my age...better yet...even older have told me that it's simultaneously the most disgusting but hilarious movie they've ever viewed. (Ian Watkin, who played Uncle Les, steals the film as soon as he shows up in his fancy car and hideous toupee). More importantly that, yeah, that's how things were and looked back then. Lastly, I wonder if the people at the Academy Awards...who gave Jackson (deservedly)I believe 11 statues for ""Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King""... possibly the single best movie I have ever seen..knew that he had this madness under his belt.

This one day he's off to get groceries and meets this pretty girl who is the clerk at the grocery store. They soon have a date and are heading for the Zoo. Lionel's over protective mom has her thoughts about her son's new love affair so she follows her son to keep an eye them. But the zoo has a new addition a rare animal called a ""Rat Monkey"". Before she knows it she is bitten. After a day or two the wound has killed Lionel's mother but turns her into a flesh eating zombie. And this is where the fun starts. This flick just has it all. Over the top horror-comedy. You get to see zombies getting it on and giving birth to a zombie baby ! Now how cool is that. You'll get to see a zombie ass kicking kung-fu priest, intestines which can kill, a huge big momma zombie, a zombie with a spine in his ass with the head still attached so it looks like a scorpion zombie, a zombie with her face stuck onto a light bulb so she looks like a jack-o-lantern, a group of zombies getting ripped to pieces by a land mower, and many more which I will not spoil for you. Yes people this is a gore fest you'll never forget !It's hard to believe that the director of the Oscar winning series ""The Lord of The Rings"" is behind this all but he is. And to be honest, it works. This movie if very entertaining and I promise, you wont be left disappointed. While this movie can't weight up to the great Special FX you have nowadays, it's way more fun then most of the Hollywood big budget blockbusters.This movie is a must see for Comedy-Horror fans, but in my opinion everyone should see this one at least once !",Dead Alive

259,aimforthehead,Braindead aka Dead Alive is a rather humorous entertaining zombie film,9,8 February 2007,Braindead aka Dead Alive is a rather humorous entertaining zombie film. If you liked The Frightners this is another must see. Peter Jackson does a fine job directing. I believe this film is set in the 50's or the 60's which was a refreshing change. The color scheme too was also rather different and added to this film's charm. This film follow's Lionel a Mama's boy who's overbearing mother turn's into a zombie. Lionel spends most of the film trying to keep his mother from eating people and along the way acquires more zombies to babysit. Throw a blackmailing uncle in the mix and Paquita (Lionel's love interest) this film never has a dull moment. But one of the best scene's involves a zombie baby and another memorable scene involves a lawnmower. This film is worth the 97 minutes it takes to watch it.,Dead Alive
260,sizzlepepper,A cheap horror flick that just happens to be directed by Peter Jackson,1,14 January 2004,"Being an enormous fan of Heavenly Creatures and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was definitely excited to see some of Jackson's older work. Dead Alive (Braindead) was the first of his older horror flicks that I got around to watching. After seeing it, I definitely don't think I will be seeing any of the others. There is something sickening about a movie that could very well be one of the goriest films ever made (so it is hailed as by many) that uses its gore for... yes, humor, and not much else. Well, and also to shock. The effects are cheap and amateur, adding to the campy, tacky ridiculousness of the entire ordeal. It seems almost crazy to waste the money and time of those kind of effects though when the intent isnt even to make them scary, it is to make them cheesy and funny. I myself did not find the film very funny. Even though the zombies are very far-fetched, the film seemed to bring this craziness to a normal world, making it slightly unsettling. This is not the intention of the film at all of course, but still, I found certain scenes even disturbing. Such as when Lionel falls through the wall with his mother's corpse in his arms at her funeral. And the embalming scene. Of course it isnt meant to be a real comment on society but it just bothered me. Also, Peter Jackson seems to have a disturbing interest in matricide. What is with this? In the film Heavenly Creatures, based on a true story, Pauline Parker, a fifteen year old girl, murders her mother. After seeing Dead Alive, which was made first (and in it Lionel Cosgrove must kill his zombie mother) I was actually slightly disturbed by the fact that Jackson then went on to do a serious film in which matricide is involved. It actually makes it seem as if there is some perverse interest in it. If it hadnt been for the horror take on this, turning the idea of matricide into a total laughfest, then the interest it wouldn't seem quite so disturbed and twisted. Anyway, if you just love gorey splatterfests that are solely for the sake of fun, is one is for you. If, however, you were looking for anything psychologically stimulating from director Peter Jackson (and if you have a weak stomach), don't look to his older work.",Dead Alive

Yes, I had rented the cut version of Braindead(DeadAlive) at a conventional video store. And especially after hearing it was one of the goriest movies ever made. Was disappointed. But then I found out that I had been duped. Two versions of this masterpiece were floating around America, I had to find the other one. I got obsessive. I checked out pictures of the uncut version on the internet. And found out that the stupid censors had to get their panties ina wad and cut every bit of ""FUN"" out of the movie. They even cut Peter Jackson's cameo out! But then guess what happened my friends? I was shopping ina grocery store last night, and found a video store within it. I decided to get a membership so I could rent Big Daddy. I also found DeadAlive in the horror section. I grimaced when I picked up the box. Remembering how I'd been duped at my OTHER video store into getting the R rated version. But then I noticed something. The box claimed that it was... UNRATED! Yes! And it had 12 extra minutes in it! I was, needless to say, very happy. So I picked this and Big Daddy up and went home. I watched this new DeadAlive and was treated to a much better version of this classic. Limbs fly everywhere, ratmonkeys, feeding a zombie through their neck. And let's not forget the hilarious scene where Uncle Les (the best character) pulls the zombie priest's teeth claiming that he has ""a nasty plaque problem"". That had me in stitches. And don't forget the lawnmower scene either. Which is much better and makes a lot more sense in this version. So whatever you do. Pay attention to the box to Deadalive if you come across it.

This film is as funny as it is gory and gruesome, which in a weird kind of way can only be seen as a compliment. Jackson does a brilliant job, a far-cry from his later LOTR and Kong films, but shows he has a wicked sense of humour and an eye for visual comedy.

He's a sissy momma's boy until he has to brutally mangle zombies to save his and his girlfriend's life. this film is simply brilliant. there are some really sick parts though. which is alright. This is so good because like evil dead, It's not trying to be serious at all.

274,prehensel,Too Much...or Not Enough?,4,24 June 2007,"Apparently, everyone who reviews this movie has to note that Peter Jackson directed it. So there, I said it. Now bugger off.This movie's status in the elite of the horror-comedies is not going to be threatened anytime soon. From what I have seen, *Evil Dead 2*, *Army of Darkness*, and *Bubba Ho-tep* are the only ones even in the same category. (In fact the ""party's over"" lawnmower scene is reminiscent of *Evil Dead 2* in the one-liner delivery, use of lawn and garden tools to kill zombies, and even the back-lighting when Lionel opens the door.) In any case, it certainly beats *Motel Hell*. And I am saying this as one who does not care for horror films with overt humor. I don't tend to enjoy them, and I didn't really love this one, but I also didn't hate it. And that is saying something.From some of the very first shots (camera angles, line delivery, and score), you can tell this is going to be a campy, schlocky horror movie, but you begin to understand what you're in for when the stop-motion Sumatran Rat Monkey kills the other monkey and Lionel rubber cements the skin back on mum's face. At one point, we even have a character who combines the traits of Bruce Lee and the Bishop of Canterbury into one bad mofo--until he turns into a zombie (after which he has sex with a mostly-decapitated nurse).I like gory movies, but this was almost too much for me. (When Lionel pulls the dog carcass out of his mum's mouth, I almost spewed--even though it was obviously a dummy head.) It did get crappy through the middle of the film. It slows down, and it's just Lionel taking care of four zombies (and an annoying baby zombie) with formaldehyde injections. Big deal. Once the zombies get loose we're back in business, and Uncle Les's repeated nut shots and Lionel doing a Scooby-Doo-esquire running-in-place-while-slipping-on-blood gag balance pretty well against the *Night of the Living Dead*, last-stand feel that seeps in. But for my money, that last-stand feel is the only reason this movie was ranked as highly as it is.",Dead Alive

Sounds boring already, and believe me, that's exactly what i was thinking during the first 20 minutes or so of this movie. But I urge you to sit through the panto-style acting and (seemlingly at first) cliché storyline and wait for the good stuff!What follows is an orgy of blood, guts, and intestines, not to mention knives, blenders, even lawnmowers! It's unbelievable - overly gory, action packed, yet the film still leaves room for plenty of comedy and a parental sub-plot.

If you tell me that zombies can be stopped by cutting off their heads (like in most zombie movies), I don't want to see a pair of legs walking around by themselves. I mean hello -- it's got no head! Plus, everything looked really cheap -- it was pretty obvious that this film had almost no budget. Each zombie looked like a puppet rejected from Jim Henson's workshop. It was hard to get worked up over the wanton destruction of a bunch of poorly done puppets.And the characters weren't at all sympathetic.

281,evolute,Twisted nostalgic trip through my memories,10,5 August 2009,"From perhaps the age of 5 much of my time was taken up creating fantasy worlds with all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures. Much of this stemmed from my fascination with creature special effects, animatronics, along with models and other fantasy beings, after seeing films or programs on TV such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Dinosaurs, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Labyrinth, Willow, Time Bandits, and a little later The Thing. I claimed I'd become a model or creature maker for movies. I'm not, but that's not important. I'm young yet, and may still pursue that one of many dreams.A few years later I discovered Fangoria magazine and would gleefully thumb the pages in a large Scottish department store. I got quite a fright once when a friend found me in my own little world of fake blood and gore.At only 8 I visited New Zealand with my mother and happened to find myself in the capital's futurist Te Papa museum, at her suggestion. At that time was an exhibition dedicated to Peter Jackson's backyard ingenuity in making his early comedy horror films. It even had the documentary of the making of Bad Taste, including his mother talking about him using the oven to bake his latex alien masks. I was so enraptured by the arousing disgustingness around me. Amazingly my mother happily left me alone, along with many other kids, in the frankly shocking scenes of the exhibition, including many bloodied props from Braindead. I went on to chase them through a maze of mirrors. It's an obscure memory I hope to never lose, but one that tells a lot about children's acceptance of things.It was over a decade until I saw the featured films. For Braindead I waited until I was able to see the original uncut version on Britain's glorious Channel 4. I eventually managed to download Bad Taste (sorry Peter Jackson) from eMule to share the greatest of New Zealand with my friends. I often brought them weird offering to watch together, matched with a smooth spliff and beers for the others.Suffice to say I was not disappointed! I've only ever seen this film alone, but from discussions with numerous people it's clear that what we have here is Jackson's finest film and undoubtedly the greatest marriage of comedy and horror in the history of cinema. It's that likely ancient way of accepting the utter ugliness of much of existence, by humourising it. Perhaps even accepting these extremes are merely variants of the same great experience. The US had it's own classic series before with The Evil Dead, and I'm extremely proud of the UK's top billing Shaun Of The Dead. However because this film is truly Kiwi I love it beyond all others.Looking back on both the museum exhibition and movies, it appears Kiwis are quite comfortable embracing these themes in daily life.

Students commented on how gory those movies are, and they are right. However, knew they hadn't seen gore until they saw Dead Alive, a movie that has haunted my mind for a dozen years. The lawnmower scene burned itself permanently into my brain. So, today we watched it. It was just as gushingly disgusting as I had remembered it. A real capper to a gore fest. My assignment will now be for my students to join IMDb and come here and post their comments. So anytime you see my name mentioned, it's so they get credit for posting. Their opinions, however, are their own.",Dead Alive
283,gummo_rabbit,Zombies as metaphors,7,20 January 2007,"We all know Braindead is one of the most talked about horror classics, and we all know who Peter Jackson is. Unfortunately, rarely - if ever - does Braindead get the serious attention it deserves.More than just blood and guts, the theme of this film is trying to control something that has gone totally wild and which is unaccepted in normal society, to the point where it becomes a shameful taboo. The solution that Lionel, the main character, finds for this problem is by facing up to this overwhelming danger, and by doing so, freeing himself from his fears.The zombies act as metaphors in this. They are monsters, but they still resemble people. Only when Lionel sees them for what they truly are, is he able to release himself from their iron grip. His mother is the most obvious example: when he has to poison her, he can't do it, because to her she is still his mother.The frantic way in which everything is filmed, and the over-the-top quality of the violence, reflect this subject matter. The viewer has to look the frenzy right in the eye.I can hear you thinking: come on, this movie is so outrageous, how can you even begin to find something serious in it? True, this is a really outrageous film. Outrageousness is its main ingredient, to be exploited and enjoyed for its own sake, just like the stereotypes (the mother, uncle Les, the priest - who, by the way, reminded me very much of Terry Jones' Monty Python character The Bishop). But they also communicate something more ambitious and serious.It's there from the very beginning. The second the natives discover he is being bitten, they kill the explorer (in other words: the ""savage"" natives know better how to deal with this uncontrollable frenzy than the so-called ""civilised"" British citizens, a nice Burtonesque dissection of colonially rooted, suburban hypocrisy...). This introduces the rat-monkey, providing the horror element, the fear of the unknown and the absolute evil.Then there is the psychological content of the mother-son-relationship. The scene in which the mother follows Lionel and his girlfriend Paquita down to the zoo is a real key scene - by combining the horror element, when the mother gets bitten, with the psychological. Perhaps even more terrifying is the shot in which Lionel's mother, already a zombie, is stumbling across the street in broad daylight like a raving maniac, seconds before she gets hit by a tram. These are truly scary images, much more so than the gore circus that ensues in the grand finale.Peter Jackson deserves recognition for having made a masterpiece of its time, as well as for the effort he put into it to give it lasting dramatic content, something which distinguishes him from directors who see horror merely as entertainment.One last thing about this film and that's that it is worth watching for one shot alone: Lionel is standing in the main hall, completely covered in and surrounded by tons of blood, flames blazing from the kitchen on the left, from where Paquita comes running and embraces him. Just as good as the ""You met me at a very strange time in my life"", skyscrapers collapsing, final scene of Fight Club.",Dead Alive

287,zhennis,The Dead Should Stay Dead,4,18 October 2010,"Dead Alive is a film that embodies a typical yet somehow fresh stereotypical zombie film. The outbreak of the virus is started by monkeys which is usually the most used since the outbreak of the HIV virus that is thought to have originated in monkeys. The difference comes when trying to destroy the zombies. Unlike the films of George A. Romero, which explain how to defeat the walking dead, Peter Jacksons installment in the genre forces our protagonist to explore different ways to destroy zombies. The story revolves around the inability to let go of the people we love despite their shortcomings, and the fact that they are deceased.This film could influence both short and long reviews; however, in the style and the focus of my reviews this will be rather short. Dead Alive ultimately is a film that looks like it was created purely to show off (Peter Jackson's) special effects talents. Now, one can say James Cameron created Avatar simply to show off special effects but it did not ""look"" that way. Dead Alive obviously sacrifices technical elements such as camera angles and setting variety. This is not a film for anyone looking for a blockbuster film. However, if you are interested in the career of Peter Jackson and/or innovative uses of special effects. If this film does have an upside to it other than its creative use of special effects, it is the acting. Typically the acting of horror movies is sub-par however the Dead Alive cast is able to exemplify the sarcasm and humility within the film. The acting style resembles District 9 where you have the perfect cast for the movie even if the movie is not so great. Dead Alive has a serious cult following that claims this to be the best zombie movie of all time. While I agree that Peter Jackson along with George A. Romero defined the zombie film, I believe Romero's installments to be far more entertaining.",Dead Alive

The plot itself was kind of shabby, but the acting and direction was superb. *The idea of zombies having sex. The Uncle with the urinary infection.

Today nobody can denie the talent of director Peter Jackson after having brought to us so different masterpieces like ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Heavenly Creatures"". Sam Raimi's (Spiderman) ""Evil Dead"" was for many years one of the best - when not THE best Horrorflick of all times. Then came Dan O'Bannons ""Return of the Living Dead"", where gore and ironical humour were mixed.  ""Brain Dead"" is a kind of melange between this two films. Never have I seen more blood, slime and gore in one single film - seldom have I laughed more (in a splatterfilm...).

If Peter Jackson should make a remake of this movie, I say DO IT! You know how awesome that would be? Everyone would see it since his work is appreciated more these days. I would love a remake of this, though CGI I think would be used more, since fake puppets and paper-made props are out these days.

In any case, if you're looking for a gory horror film that has shrieks and shrills then look no further, because despite the films cheesiness and vomit-inducing scenes, it actually was well edited and directed and does have some very creepy and scary ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" scenes.

All the characters are brilliant, crappy, but brilliant. Nearly every scene is a classic. Peter Jacksons tour de force. Not for the squeamish, but I recommend to anyone who is fan of horror to watch this movie. Especially now. When it came out in the early 90s it was quite full on, considering what special effects were like back then. But this movie has grown into itself, is better now because of its use of at the time fairly good sfx, but now the sfx are hilarious and really make you appreciate the comedic value of the film. The movie has everything,zombies, zombie love, zombie babies, necrophilia humour, kungfufighting priest that kicks arse for the lord, grave robbing, new zealanders, 50s hoodlums, pissing on graves, self aware intestines, the most brutal funny deaths you'll see and a party from hell.

This film is amazing to say the least. When you watch this film you can really tell that Peter Jackson knew exactly what he was doing. Jackson shot the film with almost cartoonishly extreme angles and close ups; the acting is cartoonish and over the top as well. In short this is a really over the top movie....Which is what make's it so special. This isn't a serious movie in the least bit; it's pure entertainment, and as far as entertainment goes this is probably one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. The two leading characters do great together and you really want to see them both together. The villains in the film are enjoyable and likable in their own ways as well. Heck though; who can't love a film with a Kung Fu fighting priest and monster intestines.

Never have I seen a movie so bloody, gory, repulsive, twisted, bizarre, cracked-out, intense, unrelenting, ruthless, disturbing and disgusting in all of my life - and believe me, I've seen a TON of weirdo movies. 'Braindead' does everything in its power to gross out its audience in one way or another and it gets the job done.  Whether it's the gross-out perverted humor, the extreme graphic violence and gore, or the cheesy acting, this movie continues to pound and pound on your stomach until you've had enough...the only problem is...I haven't.  The worst thing about this movie is that it ended...it's without a shadow of a doubt a horror masterpiece (even if it isn't that scary at all).  I love the eerie feel of the movie, the intensity, the outrageousness of the many situations the characters get themselves into, and also the in-your-face camerawork of the film.  Never have I seen a more creative, artsy, innovative, novel approach to zombie movies (not to mention gory).  While the acting may be very cheesy and the budget not up to par with box-office smashes, don't be so quick to judge - if you do, you will miss out on experiencing the most genuinely cracked-out film (and most bizarre ending) ever filmed in the history of movie making.

I actually enjoyed the Lord of the G-strings on HBO a bit more. ""Braindead"" reminded me of a Tim Burton film, but with so much more gore. Mr. Jackson stick with your own ideas, there so much more creative, and entertaining. Also I must say this film should be on the top 250 of all time it is such a amazing film, and Mr Jakson you are a visionary, and a brilliant director. I can't say enough good things about this film.

Dead Alive is that movie. Perfectly combining splatter horror, and comedy this movie is sure to make you laugh and vomit at the same time. The premise is simple, an awkward young man's mom is bitten by a Rat Monkey that leads to her becoming a zombie. Eventually she gets out and begins to spread the disease around the neighborhood. Basically you classic zombie movie. But this has a completely different feel to it. For one I couldn't stop laughing, whether is was the zombie baby or the heart and lungs monster, this movie made me laugh. But at the same time I completely lost my appetite. From watching a man get his legs eaten off, or a woman eat her own ear. It really takes a certain kind of person to understand the humor in this movie. I give this movie ten out of ten, not just for the humor and story but for the practical effects. They were absolutely amazing. A few like the monkey or the baby don't really hold up to today's standards, but when the guy gets his legs eaten away leaving just his bones, that was unbelievable. It looked so realistic. The characters were another way that made this movie great. I really enjoyed the characters, they were all people that really acted like someone would in that type of situation making it believable.I wouldn't recommend this movie to just any movie watcher. It takes a special type of person to enjoy this movie to it's full potential. But if you love movies like Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland I suggest you check this movie out.

It took awhile to find this gem along with Peter Jackson's two previous films, Bad Taste and Meet the Feebles. I just want to point out that Jackson initially got inspired to do filmmaking not only from the original 1933 King Kong which he not only payed tribute to by doing his remake of and also painstakingly remaking the lost spider pit scene from with a crew of stop motion animators, but also he payed homage to by making the rat monkeys home Skull Island the home of Kong. However there is another film that inspired him to make movies, Troma productions The Toxic Avenger, it showed him that you can go out and make a movie with next to no budget and without the studios telling you what's right and wrong. Now let's address why he chose to make his films as nasty as they are, which might I add doesn't make them bad movies but more for a certain audience, I'll say that all three films can be nasty at times but it's what adds to their charm. First off practical effect driven horror was all over the 80's and that the Genre that all the young kids were into, but regardless of how much horror wasn't respected as a genre then there were still many people getting their starts there, John Carpenter and Sam Raimi for example, everybody's gotta start somewhere. Peter Jackson didn't get known as a respectable director because of the tasteless nature of his early films, which might I add were intended to be that way, but his camerawork skills, creativity, brilliant practical effects for low budget filmmaking, humour, and offensive and dark comedy that got him more noteriety as his skills improved throughout the course of each of the following films released. They are good because they embrace the fact that they are gross, offensive and/or gory as all hell and run with it, might I add to you critics out there that won't at least admit that you weren't the target audience for these kinds of films and therefore dismiss them as garbage in their entireties are people who think that you're just above the others who like these, plus if all these were garbage then Peter Jacksons career in filmmaking would've ended just as fast as it started, so obviously there is something that he did right you were just so offput by the nature of it that you couldn't find anything good in these movies even if you tried, sorry if that sounded a bit egotistical, I'm just trying to say that it's SUBJECTIVE so don't act like people are dumb for enjoying these movies or any other movies",Dead Alive

If this movie is any indicator, my doing so would probably give Mr. Jackson a good belly laugh.I really don't know how to describe the film. Let it suffice to say that every time I think about it, even for a moment, I wish I could go back in time and destroy my friend's DVD so I wouldn't have been subjected to the ""comedy"" of the movie.

Jackson is genius!!!,10,14 December 2003,"~~~I had inadvertantly rented both Braindead/Dead Alive & Meet the Feebles at separate occasions and never made the connection that they were both directed by Peter Jackson.  After seeing the Fellwship of the Ring I decided that I wanted to know more about this director, & started to collect his past films.  You can imagine my amazement that a guy with films like Bad Taste & Meet the Feebles on his resume was chosen to shoot the epic that is LotR.  but after watching the past PJ films, I am convinced that the man is a genius.  He has fun in every film, & tells an entertaining tale.  I think that he is, before all else, a great storyteller.The thing about Braindead that strikes me is that it is, at heart, a love story.  So there happen to be a few bumps along the way to romance...like the dead mum...& the wicked little zombie-baby...not to mention the killer viscera.  But in the end, it's Lionel's desire for love that is the important thing.I've seen posts saying that Braindead is the goriest movie ever...I don't know that I can say that...but they sure used a heluva lot of blood in that lawn mower scene.In the end, I haven't seen a single Peter Jackson film that I haven't loved...and that anyone who lays down their hard-earned cash to pick up this gem of a dvd is getting every penny's worth.",Dead Alive
318,Greenx82,Splendid Absolutely Splendid,9,21 September 2004,"Saw this movie last night for the first time because its become so hard to find on DVD. I must say I was honestly impressed. Very gory, outrageous movie that has everything from decapitations to severed heads being put in a blender to zombie corpses doing the nasty. Brief synopsis of the plot, Norman Bates type mama's boy goes to the Zoo with his new (and possibly first) romantic interest while mama tails the nasty little bugger (how dare he leave his poor mother by herself) and she gets bit by a rat monkey creature while hiding in the bushes near the rodents cage. Wouldn't you know all hell breaks loose as she is infected with something much worse than rabies!! The son has to help look after mum cause he feels partially responsible and it becomes one huge comedy of errors. Ill leave the plot at that with much more to be explained and explored. Filled with a lot of fun surprises and campy acting (very well acted for a comedy horror i must say). It was done in New Zealand with help and probably financing from the New Zealand Film Commision. If you've seen and of Jacksons pre LOTR films and enjoyed this comes highly recommended if you've got the stomach to handle it. Another viewing for me and it might very well be my favorite of his!",Dead Alive

(i accept the possibility that some people actually like weird animated shorts with claymation eyeballs popping out - you know the sort - yawn) the gore wasn't gory but rather tiresome; it reminded me of the time my cat had an bite-wound abscess which exploded in a fountain of pinkish pus and blood. which admittedly was fairly gross but far more entertaining when coming out of my cat than it was in this film. i was bored by the end; there's only so much pus and plasticine you can take, and it was boredom rather than horror that made me switch off. yawnsville extreme",Dead Alive

329,emilyconnerty,Splatter Comedy at it Best!,9,23 August 2010,"Now, when I think Zombie Comedy, this is what comes to mind! The movie is from director Peter Jackson, pre-LOTR and he shows that he's always had talent. This film has everything you could want in a splatter comedy flick! It focuses on a cursed rat-monkey that bites a horrible woman at the zoo, turning her into a zombie and leaving her much abused son to try and hide it from everyone. He's in love with a girl who his mother hated, a gypsy girl who was told by a tarot card reading that great love and horrible things were in her future.Understatement of the century.Naturally, the zombies spread and soon the town is terrorized by them. This film is depraved, so very, decadently depraved! It is gory, indeed gorier than anything I have ever seen in my life. It may be the goriest film ever made, I cannot say for sure only because I've not seen every splatter fest the world has to offer. But it is so gory you cannot believe,and utterly hilarious! The gore is fake, but no less entertaining and more funny because of this. Since the movie is nothing but gore, I am loath to spoil any of this inventive carnage for the first time viewer. Just go see it.However, it is almost too much of a good thing. I was queasy many times during the film, and I have a cast iron stomach for fake gore. Saw doesn't even bother me in the slightest, but this is no Saw. It is much more intensely bloody. It borderlines disgust for me, so if you dislike gore DO NO, I REPEAT DO NOT SEE THIS FILM! You will hate it, you probably will be sick, you will be irrevocably scared by it.However, if you want zombie splatter comedy, you can almost do no better than this!",Dead Alive

The film is marred somewhat by a slow first half hour, but when it kicks off boy does it kick off. The action in this film is phenomenal and the amount of gore is pretty amazing, it is not really scary but instead is extremely entertaining. The acting in this film is relatively impressive (unlike in bad taste.) Probably the best part of the movie is the special effects, the range of ways the 'zombies' and people are killed are diverse and pretty imaginative and the deaths are conveyed in the best possible way with the most blood possible. Also the film takes an evil dead 2 approach but takes it to the extreme. As the film has some comical moments in it. All in all this movie is stunning, it is not for those with weak stomachs but if you want all out action with the most gore ever in a film, then this film is for you.

Why can't Jackson make movies like this anymore some of is best work is in Bad Taste and Dead Alive aka Braindead.. Not knocking off The Lords Of Rings saga but Jackson is way better when he's directing very Gory movies.. The Frightners was another OK movie he directed but he needs to go back to the thing he directs best Gore movies..Dead Alive is difently in my top 10 Gore/Horror/Comedy movies ever made.. The Lawnmower scene is Epic n by far the goriest scene in a movie ever.. I'am a big boy and about lost it in the custard scene..

335,neech_manley,Utterly brilliant. Utterly repulsive. Utterly hilarious.,8,14 July 2005,"This is without a doubt one of the finest examples of B-moviedom that you will ever see. Although be warned, it is horrifically repulsive in places, and is guaranteed to make squeamish members of the audience throw up / leave / cry.I had already seen Bad Taste before viewing this (Bad Taste is Jackson's other 'Splatter' film), so had a rough idea of what to expect. In all honesty I didn't enjoy Bad Taste that much, which surprised the guy who endlessly recommended it to me (he thought I would've loved the 'grossness' of it, but my immediate response was one of boredom). Having seen Bad Taste I obviously had some idea of what to expect from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised by how consistently this film cracked me up, or made me shout out 'awwwwwwwwwww' in a suitably horrified yet entertained manner. This film also contains possibly the greatest line ever uttered on screen, ""I kick arse for the lord"". I have yet to meet a person who, irrespective of their views on the rest of the film, didn't find the kung-fu preacher line / scene utterly fantastic.The vast majority of the enjoyment from this film comes from: 1. The accents. I'm serious, they're great, especially in the first scene.2. The excessive, over the top splattering of gore / blood / limbs. Some people (heh, mostly girls in my experience) seem to find this repellent, but if you have a strong stomach, you'll love it.3. The zombie baby. Awesome beyond words.4. The Priest. Sheer cinematic genius.There isn't really much else to add that hasn't already been said by the reviewers on here. Braindead is fantastic, but it's not for everybody. Best viewed in a group, with the beers flowing. In my opinion, Braindead is a much better film than Bad Taste, but it had made me want to go back and give Bad Taste another shot.

It's low budget, but well put together and incredibly inventive, showing the technical brilliance he built upon in his subsequent films. His crew of FX artists deserve particular praise for making the complex practical gags work without any help from ones&zeros. Along the way it pays tribute to many films, most notably George Romero's Dead Trilogy (especially 'Day of the Dead'), but also 'King Kong' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.

And then once its into new Zealand it all starts off. The gore is sheer brilliance, its so over the top, but some of it looks pretty realistic, like where the guts are pouring out of void in the bath tub, it was pretty believable.Its not just a film where it is all action no story, it does have a mystical plot told by gypsy cards of destiny showing what will happen. Lionels mother seemed pretty believable, and very annoying, the part was done well and I was glad she died.It had a very pythonesque humour to it, which is great, so not many people will get it. A cult classic and my fave. If you're going to watch it get the full 104 min fully uncut one that I have, its more enjoyable and less cheesy.I was glad they showed this on film 4 a while back, there was only like 20 seconds cut out.

This Australian film is great fun(what Australia makes films? next you will be telling me France does), with obvious nods to Raimi's Evil Dead and Romero's Zombie flicks. It is difficult to believe that this piece of low budget enthusiasm and the production line trash of the rings trilogy are by the same man, except possibly for one thing - both display his love of excess, and this must rank among the goriest movies ever (all done in delightfully bad taste of course).",Dead Alive

It just makes me feel sad that there are people out there who didn't find this movie to be a very rewarding experience. Like I did.I recently had the privilege to see Braindead, uncut, in a cinema (yay!). The first scene, where they were cutting that guys hands off was enough to make my stomach churn. In my opinion that was the grossest scene, except, of course, for the custard eating scene. Although the most memorable scene, and the definite climax of the film, the lawnmower-scene, was incredibly brilliant, all it did was make you laugh.Which may very well be the only problem of this movie: I was laughing so hard I missed some of the movie, forced to close my eyes or wiping tears of laughter from my eyes.Other memorable scenes include the walk with the baby in the park, the infamous ""I kick arse for the lord"" scene, or when the four main zombies are eating together. There's too much to list.",Dead Alive
349,nickdude9110,"This is no ""Lord of the Rings""",9,19 January 2007,"It's a zombie film, though the zombies are completely different than any I've ever seen. If you are bitten, then you become one in a short time. I know that seems like standard fare, but the weird part is what happens while you are a zombie. Pieces of you might randomly fall off. You can still talk, but you prefer to kill in the most hideous ways, like punching through the back of one person's head, with your hand coming through the mouth to grab another person, or by pulling the skin completely off a person's entire head. It's nearly impossible to kill them also, except by completely destroying them. Several scenes involve on zombie's intestines wrapping people up like tentacles. The movie has some of the most terrible acting, writing, dialog, and overall directing I've seen this last year, but the creative gore and zombies more than make up for it.The story follows the character Lionel who lives in New Zealand in the 1950's. He goes off with a girl to the zoo, while his horrible, wretched mother follows. She is spying on her son and his new love interest (Paquita), obviously disapproving, and she gets too close to the cage with the cursed Samutran Rat Monkey, who proceeds to bite her. Her son takes care of her for the next few days, trying to prevent his new girlfriend from finding out about his now deceased and reanimated mother, who starts to attack house guests, including Paquita's dog. Eventually, his uncle who claims to have been left Lionel's house, throws a party, unknowing about the zombie chained up in the basement, and all hell breaks loose. The movie has the BEST ACTION SCENE EVER, in which a priest goes kung-fu on some zombies in a graveyard, saying the memorable line ""I kick ass for the Lord"". Another great scene, which is the scene that gives the movie it's world record holding position, is where Lionel gets a lawnmower, starts it up, and.... You fill in the rest. The scene has fake blood being pumped at five gallons per second, running for about 4-6 minutes total. A few interesting notes: -The opening scene in which an explorer carries the Rat Monkey is the same place where Peter Jackson shot the scene in The Lord of the Rins: Return of the King when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolos travel to The Paths of the Dead. -The movie also has had more people report THROWING UP while watching the movie than any other film in history. Even I got a bit nauseated. -There is not one moment of action or dialog cut from Peter Jackson's original screenplay. -In some cinemas, tickets for the movie included paper bags for vomiting. -Some dude's dad's grave was partially in the frame for about 5 seconds in the graveyard scene, so he filed a lawsuit. As only three letters were visible (BRA), he lost the case. -Many families, after seeing The Lord of the Rings, picked up this movie to see what else Jackson had done. Those who stood through the horrible acting and dialog were definitely surprised when they got to the zombie sex scene, the lawnmower scene, and the Mother on the Roof scene. Indeed they were.Anyway, I recommend this movie, but you HAVE to stick with it. The first half of the movie sucks.",Dead Alive

I can honestly rate 'Dead Alive'  as one of my favorite movies (Along with Jarmusch's 'Dead Man', 'Brazil', 'Dr. Strangelove', 'the Bicycle Thief').  It is not because of the acting, the directing, the score or the gore, even though all these elements are wonderful and truly well done.  'Dead Alive' is one of the most amazingly and brilliantly structured films I have ever seen.  It starts off with a man being graphically dismembered, and then never takes a step backwards.  Every scene is more shocking and hilarious than the next, and every time you think to yourself ""O.K., it can't get any more outrageous"" it does.  And then it does again. And again.  This film is pure entertainment, nothing more, but I give it my highest rating because it tops every over-the-top film in existence.NOTE:  DO NOT RENT THE R-RATED VERSION!  IT IS NOT THE SAME MOVIE!

But few people realise that Peter Jackson made great films before that (""Bad Taste"", ""Braindead"", ""Meet the Feebles"", ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Frighteners""). Basically the story is that a momma's boy named Lionel gets a date with a hot Spanish girl. His mother follows them to the zoo where she is bitten by a Sumatran Rat Monkey from Skull Island (Isn't that where King Kong's from?). Anyways she gets sick and dies....Well not quite. This movie general hilarity from start to finish, with its over the top gore, gruesome slapstick violence, and zombie sex. Yes that's right, zombie sex! One of the best bits is definitely the graveyard scene with the kung fu fighting priest, but that is eventually topped by the end sequence, involving a party, zombies, and a lawn mower. Oh and an appearance from Lionel's mother in a slightly different form! I'm all for more zombie comedies but I doubt any will be able to top the gory fun that is ""Braindead""!",Dead Alive
355,FatPete,The best gore/comedy ever!,10,4 April 2002,"The movie is about a young man, Lionel Cosgrove, who has a very, very controlling mother, Vera Cosgrove. When Lionel meets a Paquita, his mother isn't very pleased. However, this has little meaning, because Vera gets bitten by a rat monkey and turns into a flesh-eating zombie! The rest of the film is a gore-fest, with the coolest SFX ever! And there's a little romance in there for you girls, too. Both human-human and zombie-zombie. And, I guess, a little zombie-human action too!",Dead Alive

Well, it had everything but the fun. It wasn't funny, the characters were unengaged, and the blood looked like mud. It was just gross. The final scenes almost won me over, but after trudging through so much mundane (It's sad that zombies can ever be mundane) I just couldn't get into it. This movie's humor fell flat. It's gore fell flat. Even the momma's boy routine was less than fun. It's a total waste of time in comparison to tons of better, funnier, gorier movies.

360,forbjok,Simply beyond words...,10,5 March 2003,"Spoilers!! Braindead, also known as Dead-Alive, is the third and last of Peter Jackson's ""triology"" (Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, Braindead). It's from 1992 and is by far the best of these movies.Braindead starts off with an expedition that has captured a rare sumatran Rat Monkey. Shortly after the rat monkey arrives at a zoo, Lionel and Paquita go there on a date. What they don't know is that Lionel's mother Vera has followed them there and their date is cut short when Vera accidentally steps to close to the rat monkey's cage and gets bitten.Lionel takes his mother home and bandages the monkey bite, but it soon turns into a festering wound, and the next day she dies, only to return as a rotting flesh eating zombie. She immediately tears the head of nurse McTavish, so she turns into a zombie as well and then tries to kill Lionel.While Lionel is doing everything in his power to keep the zombies a secret, the zombies kill more and more people, who also turn into zombies and he begins to realise that he's got a big problem.As if Lionel didn't have enough problems already, his sleazy uncle Les (the fat guy with the australian accent) discovers the zombies in Lionel's basement and mistakes them for ordinary stiffs, and uses it to blackmail Lionel into giving him the house.When Les invites his friends to a party to celebrate his new house, Lionel and Paquita accidentally injects the zombies with animal stimulant in an attempt to permanently kill them, and in no time there's a whole house party of rotting flesh eating zombies trying to kill Lionel and the few other survivors.The party is suddenly over when Lionel comes in with his lawnmower and literally mows the zombies away.
This is Peter Jackson's greatest masterpiece. Braindead features excellent music and a great story. Unlike his earlier movie Bad Taste, which was basically made up along the way, Braindead has a far more deep and meaningful storyline.Don't get it wrong, though. Braindead is a ""parody"" of many earlier zombie movies (Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, etc) but even so it beats all other zombie movies I've ever seen. In fact, it's probably the best movie I've ever seen and I've seen MANY movies (I have more than 400 movies and I've seen many that I don't have as well).Braindead is extremely funny, and quite likely the goriest movie ever made. (there are some scenes where there's hardly a spot not covered in blood)
I could try to describe the gore, but it would be pointless. There are simply no words that can describe Braindead very well. You just have to see it to believe it. (I'm not kidding, you can not possibly IMAGINE it)
I give it 10/10.If you haven't seen it yet, get up and go to the video shop right now. What are you waiting for?!Skip the popcorn, though. Good advice :)",Dead Alive

With a decapitated Dr. Hill walking around in the morgue of a hospital with an anatomical head fitted on his body and carrying his real head in front so he could see. This movie is pretty much the same thing except it is even more gory. It contains everything that one would expect from a first class zombie movie. Bodies being torn apart, zombies sitting around a table eating a delicious lunch provided by the lead zombie's son, and even even zombie sex that results in a ""cute"" little baby. The baby does have a bad distemper however. To say more...well there is more and more and more.

363,marvreturns,A Splatter Classic.,10,6 June 2003,"Peter Jackson's Dead Alive is not only a modern cult classic, but probably one of the best horror comedies ever made. From The character of the mother to the priest, every thing in this splatter classic is fair game for termination. The gore factor is so high in fact that you may not be able to eat for days but the laugh factor is so high that you would want to experience the ordeal again.See it and be shocked.",Dead Alive
364,fatherjimmy4,The one and only true splatter movie,9,22 July 2003,"I believe that the term splatter movie or gorey movie is thrown around a lot, and given to films such as Tobe Hoopers 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' when it is obviously not gorey, just disturbing.  But there is, without a shadow of a doubt, one film that will reign for ever as the bloodiest movie of all time, Peter Jacksons 1992 gore fest, Braindead.The film begins with a hilarious scene in which the gore starts straight away and shows the viewer what he/she is in for.  But the films gore doesn't really begin until the last 30 minutes.  Before that the film consists of rather disgusting scenes (including the infamous custard eating scene) which are actually quite disturbing, but it isn't before long that the gore and laughs come flooding in.  Including one of the funniest scenes of any film i have ever seen, taking place in a graveyard with an ass-kicking priest and a couple of biker zombies.But it is the movies finale that is a real gem, using 300 litres of blood for the end scene, it is an incredibly blood-soaked 30 minutes.  The movies icing on the cake, is the legendary flymo scene which is one of the most compelling bits of cinema in history, a real bit of magic.
To conclude, do not sit down to watch this either expecting to see a serious horror movie or just before you eat a meal.  If buckets of blood and gore takes your fancy, nothing is better than this gore dripping masterpiece.

Could be.,10,20 July 2005,"Crazy, visceral, over the top, quirky, violent, gory, silly, extreme and (in it's own way) sweet, are just a few words that can describe this visual extravaganza.What makes it such a good movie? It's fast paced, it's witty, it's charming... and it is GROUNDBREAKING,it's an important movie of the genre.Lionel is a loser who lives with his dominant mother. Lionel finds a way out, by hooking up with Paquita (a beautiful Diana Peñalver), but soon Lionel's mother gets bitten by a RAT MONKEY and she gradually starts to decompose (it's hilarious) and turns into a living dead... Lionel like a loving son he is, tries to hide the fact that her mother is a zombie, keeping her sedated with drugs... until, naturally, all hell breaks loose.Timothy Balme is genius as Lionel, I mean; HE'S SO UNDERRATED, he gives a truly comedic performance that's top notch and really entertaining, so is the rest of the cast.This is my favorite Peter Jackson film, and maybe one of the best horror comedies EVER. It's so f***ed-up, crazy and over the top it's almost poetic.Everyone who considers himself (or Herself) a Horror Lover, a GoreHound, a rare-movie seeker or a Three Stooges fan should get their hands on this unusual flick.",Dead Alive
366,filmfanjesse,The best in the horror comedy genre,10,29 December 2012,"I've always had a soft spot for horror films. It's more than likely because they were some of the first movies I really fell in love with and were my entry into becoming a film buff. Although, I really do like serious horror films such as The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street, horror films that don't take themselves seriously like Evil Dead 2 or this film, Dead Alive, are the best ones. They stop trying to take a movie were a bunch of people die in sometimes completely ridiculous ways and instead make it into pure comedy. This movie does it so successfully. The movie already starts off with a great introduction scene with some ridiculous effects. The main plot of the film follows Lionel, played by Timothy Balme, and his very obsessive mother. Lionel meets Paquita, played by Diana Penalver, and she thinks they are romantically connected due to a fortune told by her grandmother. This doesn't really sound like much of a horror movie does it? Well, let's just say a rat monkey bites someone and everything breaks loose to put it in the simplest of terms. Things just go crazy.From a zombie baby being thrown around the park to a lawnmower being used to kill a ton of zombies. It is just ridiculous in the greatest way possible.The effects used in the movie are very fake looking but completely on purpose it adds to the humor level of the movie. The movie is filled with great overacting in some scenes which always plays into the horror comedy genre. Overall, if you just love comedy horror this is some of the best you can possibly get out of the genre. It is extremely enjoyable and filled with some of the most hilarious scenes in the genre possible.",Dead Alive

Like most horror-comedies from that era, the humor seems outdated and often dumb or even cringe-worthy (e.g. the mumbling grandma in the dinner scene, or the ""zombie baby - playground scene"").BUT, that's not what I've watched the movie for. Primarily, I wanted to experience a gore fest and that is exactly what I got.I think, no one did it better than Peter Jackson when it comes to gore FXs and makeup. This movie is just so over the top and hard to overtrump that it definitely is a must see if you are looking for a blood feast.So, even though I didn't quite like most of the non-gory scenes, the last third of the movie totally made it up for me.",Dead Alive
369,zakie-holdren,Nothing comes close...,10,19 May 2006,"I give this a 10 because of assorted scenes in the first hour, and for the last half hour. It is, by far, some of the most violent, gory, horrifically grotesque film ever made. Scratch the: THE most violent, gory, horrifically grotesque film ever made. The film starts out, however, rather weak. The main character, Lionel, stumbles into a fruit market and catches the eye of a Spanish clerk, Paquita. Seeing him as the man of her dreams (through a weird coincidence), she seeks him out and begins to see him socially. There's only one problem: he's a TOTAL mamma's boy, and his mom is rather demanding and mean. She spies on him and Paquita on a trip to the zoo, and is bitten by a rat monkey from Skull Island (its arrival in New Zealand, the film's location, is the opening scene). Soon, she becomes a decomposing zombie, yet Boy Scout Lionel can't help but still care for her, even when she goes a bit, well, nuts...The plot, I must say, is rather unoriginal at the beginning, very straightforward, and the dialogue and acting can be a bit overkill. So why does this get a 10? I've been around a gory film or two. I'm what you would call a fan of cinema carnage. I've been shocked and I've been entertained by the occasional beheading, disembowelment, dismemberment, etc. I often laugh at the audacity of the movie to include such insane elements into the plot. Until I saw this film, I was under the impression that I had seen basically all I needed to see.I had no idea...The first hour or so had very graphic and disgusting displays of gore, one of my favorite shows Lionel's mum shoving her hands through a nurse's skin in the cheek, blood spewing, and then ripping the head nearly off, with only a small patch of skin at the back of the head keeping it attached to the body. After this, I thought it would get bad, but I had no clue. The middle parts are more disgusting humor, and less violence. All the while, I was waiting for this last half-hour, which I thought would be underwhelming given the hype.I hope not to spoil to much (if you hadn't read the warning above), but I have never truly had a TRUE jaw dropping moment. Many times, I have tried to satisfy other people by showing such a show of shock, but I had never really seen anything worthy of such a response. After viewing the last half hour of this movie, my jaw hurt so much. It had been dropped for the duration of the party scene, and I hadn't noticed until the movie was over and the pain kicked in. It was so horrifically disgusting that I almost considered turning it off because I thought that I would be officially desensitized to ANYTHING. The lawnmower scene almost makes you sick at the amount of blood. And not just blood, but puss and flesh that makes a yogurt-like solution that makes you wanna vomit. And the final battle with mother...No words.It's over the top, of course, but don't let that fool you. You will need a STRONG stomach....But what a ride!",Dead Alive
370,ZombieApocalypse,Your gonna need a wet-vac to clean up this gore fest !,9,13 November 2005,"This is truly Peter Jakson's Greatest. A non stop, balls to the wall bloodbath that slaps you in the face harder than your ma-ma's hand bag. This is not for the squeamish, but if you can handle it, I definitely recommend this title for any fan of the horror genre. In the first part of the movie we learn of a terrible rat like monkey found on a island somewhere in the middle of the ocean. when a man is attacked by this demon monkey, and gets every one of his limbs cut off by his crew, we know something is terribly wrong. why was his crew so frightened by this demon monkey? you'll soon find out in gruesome detail. Enter Lionel Cosgrove(played by Timothy Balme.) He just can't seem to get his life together, (let alone keep his mother together. Whatever will be left of her anyway)We learn that the demon monkey has been transferred to a zoo near Lionels house, and when his mother gets bit, we learn the horrors that the demon monkey carries. Lionel is a momma's boy, and spends day in, and day out tending to his dear old mum's needs. Even when his mother becomes deathly ill, and her skin starts falling off, Lionel is there with open arms. Over the course of the movie more and more people get infected, and Peter Jakson does what he does best, GORE, GORE, And more GORE. We are talking puss shooting into soup at the supper table, lungs being ripped out, zombie sex, intestines with a mind of their own, one ass-kicking zombie pounding kung-fu kicking preacher, and the coolest zombie-kill scene you will ever see when Lionel plows through dozens apon dozens of zombies with a lawn mower strapped to himself. And then of course he still has to answer to his dear old mum. This is by far one of my favorite flicks. It is truly a horror geeks wet dream. So if your a horror fan, I urge you to check it out.

The closest they get to that is a throwaway comment in the beginning about evil spirits.This is not a movie you watch if you expect any sort of logic to guide the zombies, their body parts or their actions. Some of them eat their victims, some of them just kill for the hell of it, and at least three are still driven by lust. Also, you should not expect everyone to turn into conventional zombies or for the time-honored classic of bodily dismemberment or beheading to have any appreciable effect beyond irritating the zombies.This IS a movie you watch if you want a pure, mindless good time. For all its plot holes and inanities, it tells an entertaining story of a young man caught in the middle of his worst nightmare...finding out his mother truly is Prime Evil. Between worrying about his new girlfriend, being blackmailed by his uncle and trying to keep the zombie plague from spreading while taking care of the zombies already created, the lead actor pulls off an admirable job of acting scared, confused and desperate.Not to mention that near the end is the most creative way yet I've seen of getting rid of zombies, and the final nemesis manages to be scary despite its obvious (deliberately so?) puppetry.While hardly the ""masterpiece of horror"" it claims to be in the trailer, this movie is still worth buying, if only to watch on Halloween before or after the midnight showing of ""Rocky Horror"".9/10",Dead Alive

Second, all the violence has a point and adds to the movie in some way. It's brilliantly done. If you cut out the part where the mom eats her own ear, you lose a hilarious scene and a more reasonable explanation for why Nora Matheson is so terrified.So, I'm trying to buy the movie and I have no idea which version I originally saw, probably the 97 min. one. But I see here that the original is 104 mins so what else did they freakin' cut?! It's so frustrating. The movie isn't that long, there's no reason to cut anything! As for the violence, with movies like Hostel and Saw 37 on our shelves, how can the censors begin to justify their rating system. This movie is hilarious!

That audience will not be ready for the Braindead's gore, blood, and guts.Although do I believe that the rat monkey has furry feet...For all those horro-com junkies out there, this movie is head and shoulders above them all.  I seen the film many times and I'm still laughing so hard that I am wiping tears from my eyes. I highly endorse Braindead as a party flick; this movie is great when viewed by the largest number of sick minds at once! Rent it. Buy it. Enjoy it.",Dead Alive
387,ZakG,"Best zombie flick ever, with Jackson's brilliance for continuity.",7,25 September 2002,"Quite simply, this is the best zombie film ever made. The movie follows the first rule of blood 'n' guts horror movies, 'make it a comedy!'. You can see why Peter Jackson has built himself such a succesful career. The continuity throughout is amazing, with the scenes comparing only to the genius of old Tom & Jerry and Warner Bros cartoons, with added gore. What really shines through is how effective the special effects are, especially when you consider the tiny budget this film was made on. The choice of cast also works well. It seems that when choosing the actors and actresses, they chose the sort of people you would never expect to see in this sort of movie, turned them into zombies, and let the story do the rest. This film is a real laugh out loud affair, best watched with a group of friends, plenty of beer and a twisted sense of humour. For a true gore fest, watch with Jackson's first comedy horror Bad Taste. You need never see another zombie film again.",Dead Alive

It's hard to convey just how over-the-top the gross-out visuals are here; on the other hand, every moment of the film rides an obvious wave of humor. If Re-animator and The Evil Dead touched the right nerve but left you craving more gore and guffaws, you might get your fill here. Great college/camp-crowd flick.

389,vegeta13613,The Best Horror/ Comedy Movie of All Time,10,25 February 2008,"If you can get through the first 20 minutes or so, Peter Jackson's (Lord of the Rings) Dead-Alive is without a doubt the best Horror-Comedy of all time. I'll admit that the first time through I wasn't sure about the first 1/4 of the movie, but if you have seen the whole thing, I can't see how anyone could disagree that this is the best Horror/ Comedy movie of all time. It includes a ""walking"" anus/ intestines that begs for it's life, a protagonist that literally mows through a house filled with dozens and dozens of zombies (ending in a house with an inch of blood and gore on the floor), a twenty-foot tall zombie mother, zombie sex (that, of course, results in a zombie baby being walked through the park in a baby stroller lined with barbed wire by the protagonist), a ninja-priest, and a lawnmower (trust me, you'll love the lawnmower scene... and the baby... and the ""living"" intestines... and pretty much everything else).

392,unirags1987-1,A Gore-Fiends Messiah,9,5 October 2008,"Romance, suspense, action, drama, zombies, tons and tons of gore and oh so much more. 'Braindead', a film that makes Eli Roth's films look as harmless as a disemboweled boar. If you get in a roar for Peter Jackson and immense amounts of gore, see 'Braindead'! Don't be a bore.Being a widely known and respected director after winning numerous 'Academy Awards' for his work on 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, Peter Jackson's early film contributions seem forgotten. Two of his earliest films 'Bad Taste' and 'Braindead' are perhaps two of the greatest splatter comedy films ever made. 'Braindead' is like director Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead 2' on LSD. This New Zealand film will entertain, humor, gross-out and astound all who watch it.If you have found your thirst for gore unquenched by modern horror films like the 'Saw' series and Eli Roth's 'Hostel' films, 'Braindead' is your cinematic Gatorade. Jackson's splatter-piece contains some of the most creative gore effect scenes in cinema history and to this day ranks as the goriest film ever created. Disembowelments, spinal replacements, zombie fornication, defacements, hundreds upon hundreds of detached limbs and much, much more.The film centers around the character Lionel Cosgrove, played by Timothy Balme ('Exposure', 'Via Satellite'). Complications in the plot begin after Lionel's mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey and starts to rot, decompose and develop a particular desire for human flesh. His refusal to accept her death causes him to keep her within his house, however the situation is soon complicated after she infects a few more citizens. (including a kung-fu priest, a nurse and a punk.) Between trying to keep his new zombie pets sedated with tranquilizers and trying to avoid his greedy Uncle Les and new girlfriend Paquita, Lionel soon finds himself in an impossible situation. The plot really thickens, however, when Uncle Les throws a house party at Lionel's and the nearly the entire house is infected, leaving only Lionel, Uncle Les, Paquita and a girl named Rita to fend of hundreds of zombies for both there lives and the future of humanity. It is at this point in the film that Peter Jackson's superb creativity in the splatter-genre really shines.One scene in general puts 'Braindead' in the history books. In this scene everything seems hopeless after Lionel has just been thrown through the window and Pequtia and Rita are moments away from being devoured. Then at the last moment, Lionel burst through the front door with a push-lawnmower tied to his chest and delivers one of the best one liner's ever: ""Party's over."" He then goes on a five-minute rampage, cutting every zombie in his path into bits. This scene holds the world record for the most blood used in a movie scene. An estimated five gallons of movie blood was pumped every second in the infamous 'lawnmower scene'. To say the least the scene gives the same sense of satisfaction as surviving a nuclear holocaust.Don't be fooled by 'Braindead's' seemingly shallow concept; besides from being just a great achievement in splatter films, it is also a fantastic overall film. Between Peter Jackson's phenomenal direction, Timothy Balme's great performance and Peter Dasent's fantastic score, 'Braindead' is an overall cinematic masterpiece. It even received a large amount of critical acclaim and won several awards. Timothy Balme won several awards for his performance for both the 'Fantafestival' and the 'New Zealand Film and TV awards', while Peter Jackson won the 'International Fantasy Film Award' for best film. The film won numerous other awards at the 'New Zealand Film and TV Awards' including best director, best film, best screenplay and best contribution to design. If it were a film made on US soil, I have no doubt in my mind that it would have scored highly at the 'Oscars' as well.In conclusion, if this kind of risqué entertainment arouses your interest, or if you just want to see Peter Jackson's early work, I highly recommend you go out and see this pinnacle of cinematic awesomeness. I proudly give 'Braindead' four karate-chopping men of the cloth out of four.",Dead Alive
393,spielferg,"Blood, Blood and more Blood",7,7 January 2003,Having just watched Braindead I felt the need to say that this was a film that contained the most blood in any film that I have ever seen.Having said this however I have to say that every drop of blood that was used in the film was essential as it was the O.T.T nature of the film that really appealed to me. This film was both pure shock and comedy at the same time. I highly recommend it for a night in with some friends.,Dead Alive

But that's only because their stomachs couldn't keep up with the movie.But mine did, and that's why I love this movie. It's funny, it's gory, and most of all, it's entertaining. Nothing is more satisfying than seeing man's arms cut off by natives, man terrorizing an party with an lawnmower and many other gory scenes this movie has to offer.The beginning of the movie is pretty tame to nowadays standards, but after half way through the movie gets really REALLY messy. If you are easily disgusted by zombies and blood, stop watching immediately! The end scene is by far the GORIEST movie scene EVER and should not be seen if a person has an easy stomach. Trust me.

Despite being a tongue-in-cheek addition to the gore-horror genre, it seemed like it had been made with a budget 15 times that it was made with.
When watching The Two Towers, I could see Peter Jackson's roots from this film and the previous Bad Taste poke through, most visibly in the scene where Saruman's orcs are introduced.This picture has one of the best endings I have ever seen. I won't give away spoilers but it was the most genious and hilarious finales of a film that I have ever witnessed.Of the few films that I have seen from New Zealand, it shines through as one of the best films I have ever seen, whether from Hollywood or elsewhere.",Dead Alive

However how can you not be impressed with a film like Braindead, Those who rated it as 1 and brought its rating down to a scandalous 7.5 need to go outside and have a word with themselves. Peter Jackson is now being hailed as a genius by the mainstream movie goers for LOTR however those who know his earlier work (braindead, bad taste, meet the feebles, heavenly creatures and the Frighteners) have known for far longer. Played exactly at the right tone, great characters, and amazingly sickening effects and all on a shoestring budget. This has to be one of my favorate movies of all time (although the end monster could have been alot better). On a final note all hail Peter Jackson for bringing us not only LOTR but this little gem.

Well this is an amazing film to start with. Jackson, collaborating with is wife and co-screenwriter ""Frances Walsh"", shines high, combining film elements of George A. Romereo, Sam Raimi, and Dario Argento. This film's story line, along with its subtle cinematography,and complex shot composition, as well as an abrasive chopping horror style, proves that Jackson is definitely one of the most diverse Directors working in the film industry today. Not only does The film push zombie film-making to an ultimate new level, it will definitely make you celebrate diversity in film-making with the academy recently highlighting him with Oscar winnings.

I truly feel that this is Peter Jackson's best film, lord of the rings is nowhere near as good. The basic outline for a zombie film is the same but it is executed originally. I will start with telling you about the budget, Basicaly it is a 53 hour week at British national wage, but my god was it put to good use.

Excellent,10,17 February 2005,"Peter Jackson's Braindead (also known as Dead Alive) is one of the most hilarious, highly entertaining, highly imaginative and, most of all, BEST zombie flicks ever made. Right from the opening (""Zengaia!"") I was hooked.I watched this movie when I had heard some enthusiastic and well-placed reviews on this site. I knew some things that would happen - EXCEPT the opening. It just blew me away! And from that point, jaw wide open, I was hooked.With some brilliant and well placed sight gags - the baby zombie, for instance - the film has many strengths and not many flaws. Setting it in the fifties is a clever thought, and leads to some VERY funny moment. I knew that there was a lawnmower scene, but it wasn't the way I expected it to be. With some absolutely politically incorrect moments - two zombies screwing on a table, and later on the floor - it has insured my 10/10 mark of hon.One of the things that I liked most was the pus-in-the-custard scene. Man, I was about to laugh my head off. (literally, but no pun intended)This film, along with the Aussie flick Undead, is one of my all time favourite movies. It is also my favourite zombie flicks.With the best sight gags this side of a Zucker movie (top of zombie's head on floor, to name but one) Braindead is a must see for anyone who likes their zombie flicks gory, good, and hilarious.

Examples would be: ""The Wild Bunch""(western),  ""Pink Flamingos""(cult)  and  ""Singin' In The Rain""(musical).Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" (""Braindead"") is a peak.

The film starts off relatively slowly, but once the fun starts it doesn't let up. The gore gets bloodier and bloodier, leading to some of the blackest humour you'll ever see (The Zombie dinner scene is a classic). The characters are unforgettable, the Kung-Fu priest (""I kick ass for the Lord"") and the vicious Zombie baby are two of the best, while the whole film is suffused with such a sense of morbid fun, you can tell the crew had a ball making it.

The make up and the general air of the film is designed in a good order and although some special effects seem not satisfactory it contains successful violence factors that can make you vomit.Also the film has a comedy mood indeed,for example in the film you will get surprised when you see some unusual zombie types that make love and get pregnant, further more a zombie child adds an absurd effect on the watchers so you both laugh and hesitate to watch splashing fleshes.",Dead Alive

Just watch Meet the Feebles or Bad Taste to see what I mean. LOTR was not at all his most common style of film.The special effects are pretty good when you think about the sheer amount of them and the fact that Peter Jackson had a small budget and most likely did a lot of it himself with a small group of people. He uses miniatures well and the fact that most of the effects were meant to look a bit silly so that people don't get mentally scarred.The acting was pretty good for a B-movie and the genre of the film allows for a bit of overacting and stereotypes. It was meant to be unrealistic and should not be taken so seriously. It is just a bit of fun by making a simple story so ridiculously over-the-top.",Dead Alive
427,devdj,the single worst movie ever created,1,22 November 2007,"I cannot believe that the screenplay for this film was even considered. There was not even a lick of entertainment in the entire movie. The gore was too extreme, I had to pause the movie to throw up several times just because it was so terrible. I cannot understand why anyone on this entire site would give this movie a vote that is more than 1. The film was not funny at all. It was simply sickening taking the brilliant invention of a zombie from George Romero and turning it into this disaster of a movie. I only continued to watch the film to laugh in it's demented sick face. My final decision that nothing will change is that this was the single worst film ever made.",Dead Alive
428,GogginDugalle,The Best Zombie Movie Ever,10,20 November 2007,"Dead Alive is an extremely entertaining movie, most definitely my favorite zombie movie, and one of my favorite films of all time. After a sort of prelude that foreshadows the hearty volume of blood and gore in the movie, the story starts off with Paquita, a young lady who works at the general store for her father and grandmother. She starts to become romantically entangled with Lionel, an introverted young gentleman who lives with and under the control of his elderly mother. When Lionel and Paquita go on a date to the zoo, Lionel's mother follows in secret with the intention of spying on them. She gets bitten by a vicious Sumatran Rat Monkey and Lionel takes her home. Over the next day the bite causes her to become sick, delirious, and start to literally fall apart. After eating part of her own ear and most of Paquita's dog, a nurse comes to take Lionel's mother to the hospital but it is too late and she dies. But then she comes back as a zombie and kills the nurse, who also becomes zombified. Lionel now finds it upon himself to lock the zombies in his basement and struggle to keep anyone from finding out, even Paquita. This is further complicated by new zombies that he has to keep hidden, his conflicting emotions over Paquita and his zombified mother, and the meddlings of his sleazy uncle.This is one of the famous Peter Jackson's earliest films. I have heard people remark on how far he's come since then with Lord of the Rings, which implies that Dead Alive is an inferior and poorly made movie. On the contrary, I find Dead Alive to be much more entertaining and a better use of my DVD money. It has a thoroughly interesting and surprisingly complex plot, and every single one of the characters is quite likable. It also has a strangely intelligent way of producing hilarious humor from violence, gore, and death, most of which won't be enjoyed by anyone who gets turned off by that sort of thing. It's a highly quotable film as well, full of lines such as ""What, no pudding?"", ""That's my mother you're pissing on..."", and of course, ""I kick ass for the Lord!!"" I've seen quite a few zombie movies, but Dead Alive is the only one I can think of that has unique and humorous zombies that are part of the film's entertainment instead of merely undead people who want to eat the living. Films such as Sean of the Dead are quite humorous as movies, but the zombies themselves are typical walking undead instead of the source of much of the comedy. Some of the zombies in Dead Alive are funny, such as a zombie with a garden gnome shoved into his neck where his head used to be, and some are downright grotesque even amongst the blood and guts that fills the last third of the movie. There is also a zombie baby toddler thing running around that is humorously annoying yet holds a sinister undertone and is often the source of many of the film's funniest moments.Dead Alive has some insane gore and blood content, but most of the brutality is stylized or so completely over the top that it doesn't come across as horrifically violent as it would have been had it been presented in a realistic fashion. It's often cited as the bloodiest film ever made based on the massive quantities of fake blood used in its production, and based on the infamous lawnmower scene alone I would agree. Despite its initial image as a shallow film that is little more than an exceptionally bloody zombie movie, Dead Alive is a hilarious and witty masterpiece that also has the most creative and amusing zombie permutations I've ever seen.",Dead Alive

Actors are terrible but not in a weird-but-goofy way, they simply suck. If he hadn't taken Lord of the Rings job, he would be making these horrible movies until he overshadows Ed Wood. That man at least had a vision of creating an ultimate horror masterpiece. This guy just takes some gore, and mix it up with sick and disgusting images in his head and there - he calls it a movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this to any true horror lover. Pathetic LotR adorers, who would buy any piece of crap as long as ""The"" Peter Jackson signs it, are probably most of its viewers. They'd even dare to call it a good movie even though, deep inside, they know it doesn't worth a dime. Dear Peter, stick to the homo-hobbits and that fairy-tales of yours. Seriously, I'm begging you, for the love of cinematography don't get back to making horror movies. And don't start making comedies. Don't disappoint your hordes of mindless zombies loving you for LotR work, and most important, don't disappoint good movies' fans by making any other genre. Have mercy!

A local man named Lionel is somewhat of a mama's boy to an extremely evil and vile woman named Vera. One day he goes to the small local convenience shop where he meets the very superstitious Paquita Maria Sanchez. For Paquita it was love at first sight and she invites him to go to the zoo with her the next day. His mother finds out about this and decides to ruin their date and gets bitten by the rat monkey at the zoo. Soon she dies and becomes a zombie and infects other people in the neighborhood. As Lionel tries to hide this from Paquita and the rest of the community hilarity and gore ensues!",Dead Alive
433,metis03,The King of Splatter Movies,8,7 December 2008,"The film starts on Skull Island where an expedition has been sent in order to capture a rare rat monkey for Newtown zoo. It is immediately apparent that contact with the monkey has dark consequences after the local tribe attempt to stop its export at all costs and one of the captors is butchered by his own men after only the tiniest bite. Back in Newtown, star crossed lovers Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) and Paquita Maria Sanchez (Diana Peñalver) set out on a secret date to the a fore mentioned zoo. However Lionel's controlling mother Vera (Liz Moody) is there to spy on them. As she creeps through the bushes she gets a little too close to the rat-monkey's cage and suffers a severe bite. Lionel rushes his mother home, but despite his best efforts (fuelled by his inner guilt about causing his father's death as a boy) the damage is already done. Paquita warns Lionel that 'Dark forces are amassing against him', she's not wrong.I feel it is worth pointing out at this point that this film is officially the goriest film ever as it used a record amount of stage blood. So if you are looking for gore Braindead cannot be beaten, there was 700 litres used in the last scene alone (the one with the lawnmower, i won't go into detail because it really must be seen). Note that the Zombies in Braindead are not 'killed' by the tried and tested method of destroying the brain or removing the head. These Zombies will attack until they are blended to nothing. For example our hero Lionel is attacked at various points by a single hand, the top part of a severed head and even the guts of a dismembered body. If u can still see it, its coming for you.Braindead is a horror/comedy which means the plot is not particularly developed, there is no real explanation of why or how the bites lead to people turning to zombies and whilst there is brief mention of a curse, this is not enforced. There is an interesting back story regarding Lionel but the other characters are largely based on stereotypes which means there is not a huge amount of personality development. Having said that the film is fairly unique in its use of zombie characterisation, in most horror films the transition of person to zombie involves the loss of anything that made the character human. However in Braindead the main zombies retain their previous traits but they are distorted to reflect their worst, this adds a villainous dimension that zombie films tend to lack.Being a comedy this film does lack any particularly frightening moments, this isn't helped by the fact that the visual effects, although entertaining, now seem dated. I felt more moments where I was impressed with the the effects rather than startled or scared by them. However the comedy and gruesome elements more than make up for the lack of frights. The comedy is very twisted and undeniably hilarious, it would probably not appeal to a mainstream audience but I would definitely suggest that it would appeal to most zombie film fans, who would likely enjoy Lionel restraining a zombie by digging a rake into its head and clamping the other end into a vice.",Dead Alive

Gets high marks for massive amounts of pointless disgust and pure rubbish.

If for some reason you found this movie a success in either comedy or horror, you most likely need to get yourself into the sunlight and enroll yourself in some kind of social development course. This attempt at entertainment almost drove me back to reading. It should be noted this is a composite analysis by three individuals trapped in Iraq with nothing better to do, and we decided to turn off this movie and stare at the wall.

I'm not one to complain about a movie's plot because most zombie moves are just about mindless killing - but the entire premise of this movie is so ridiculous.

438,jmanc1347,~Slapstick Cinema~,1,17 May 2010,"Braindead a.k.a. Dead Alive is a slapstick comedy with excessive amounts of blood & guts & gore. It starts out slow but then gets really heavy later into the movie. If you like that sort of thing, this will be a classic for you for years & years.For a movie made in the 90's it appears a little more old-school than that. If you like ridiculous amounts of gore combined with that really old-school slapstick comedy then this movie is for you. If you're idea of a decent zombie movie is something like Day of the Dead, or Resident Evil, then this might be one to avoid. It just depends on your preference.This is NOT a zombie movie to be taken seriously by any means. If you like your horror gore-fest movies to still try to cling to at least an ounce of realism, this is NOT for you. This is a COMEDY.And by realism I don't mean how the dead act, because that would be absurd, but instead, just how the living react to seeing the dead (especially the leading actor.) Who is going to take a baby zombie to the park or try to constantly tranquilize them? You either kill the things or you run for your life, you don't lock them in the basement, go to bed, & then invite them up for a tranquilizer family breakfast.But that's just a comedy being a comedy. The acting, though outdated, fits for the time. There are some inconsistencies, such as super strong zombies becoming gentle when they get their hands on our main hero, & our hero trying to bury zombies multiple times even though they already jumped out of the ground before.Resident Evil: Degeneration is my kind of zombie flick. I like a zombie film built upon action, horror & then touches of other elements: romance, comedic moments etc., not as a full-on comedy.Braindead a.k.a. Dead Alive is a slapstick comedy with excessive amounts of blood & guts & gore though not the most real-looking of such.

The excessive gore which I am sure you have heard about is not until the end, but this scene is preceded by a chain of hilariously strange and impossible events.

This movie is for a very selective audience.

Jackson is relentless with his gleeful violence and wastes no time in setting up the plot, making Dead Alive perhaps one of the finest horror movies ever made.

444,gustavomgds,One of the greatest masterpieces of comic gore,10,13 August 2014,"In 1992, Peter Jackson gave us this. For modern moviegoers it may seem odd (having in mind the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), but before his Hollywood stardom, Peter had this bizarre propensity of creating extremely gory pictures where everything is, I dare to say, ""disgustingly funny"".Let me give you a super quick synopsis of the story: A ""Sumatran Rat- Monkey"" (google it, it's a thing) is a hybrid creature - that ""according to legend"", is the result of the rape of tree monkeys on Skull Island by plague carrying rats - is captured and shipped to a local zoo.Lionel Cosgrove (Timothy Balme) lives with his insanely scary soon-to- be-a-monster mother, Vera (Elizabeth Moody). Lionel, on a casual visit to a market, meets Paquita (Diana Peñalver) and helplessly falls in love with her, to his mother's dismay.While peeping on the two during their date in the zoo, Vera is attacked by the hedious creature. By raising the ""impossible love"" cliché to a whole other level, Vera turns into a ear dropping zombie, that will be the great obstacle between Lionel and Paquita's love.But it gets worse. Vera infects other people and the number of zombies starts to grow. The only solution that Lionel sees is to keep all of them concealed in the basement, giving them repeated injections of a so called deadly poison, that turns out to be an ""animal stimulant"". You see where this is going, don't you?Now, let's give a more technical analysis of this scorned flick.The narrow shots (close-ups) in this movie have a switched effect. Normally they are used to emphasize dramatic scenes, where tension reigns. But in this movie, these shots are used to accentuate the comical expressions of the characters, and also to show the viewer in detail all the disgusting stuff along the movie.""Braindead"" is completely waggish. From the music to the dialogues. And these are quite priceless: we have quotes like ""That's my mother you're pissing on"" or ""Your mother ate my dog!"".Everything about this movie is designed to make you sick (yeah, keep this in mind, don't watch it after a heavy meal). But in a good way. It's hard to find a scene without any gore in it. Peter Jackson takes everything to the limits and that's one of the keys of comedy: exaggeration.When the movie was released in 1992, it was a commercial failure but over the years it earned a cult status, in great part thanks to the success of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.According to experts, ""Braindead"" is placed in the ""trash"" movie category.

Not the case here. As for a sense of humor, nowhere in this movie have i found anything remotely funny, just one bad joke after another (for example the bombastic 'I kick arse for God', when the priest fights some zombies in the cemetery). The gore is extremely unrealistic to the point of ridiculousness, the only thing it accomplishes is to make you sick. This movie has no style whatsoever. I'm sure peter jackson thought he had some pretty original ideas in there, and i'm sure the 30 year old nerds who play with action figures in their mother's basements also think so (they might have actually felt an emotional connection with the main character, which would have lead them to further misinterpretation of mr. jackson's movie making skills), but believe me, this movie is totally worthless.

The violence in this film is disgusting not for how it's depicted, but for what is depicted. I'll spare you the details, not to avoid sharing spoilers but because I'm revulsed by the thought of them.See this movie if you're curious as to just what kind of man was entrusted with the billion-dollar Lord of the Rings trilogy. See this movie if, like me, you want to be literate in the zombie/ survival horror genre. See this movie if you derive pleasure from scenes of zombie horror in and of themselves, that is, you're a zombie-porn addict. Otherwise just run away--and not slowly, like the Night-of-the-Living-Dead zombies, but Return-of-the-Living-Dead zombie fast.",Dead Alive
458,cannibaljon01,The goriest fright film of all time... genius,9,15 September 2005,"I remember watching Dead Alive for the first time when I was still in middle school. I was obsessed with the gory horror movie and was captivated by the caption on the box proclaiming it to be the goriest ever. Man, were they not kidding. I remember being haunted for weeks at some of the horrific imagery and the nightmares caused many sleepless nights. However, I hated the movie. ""Why?"" you ask, and the answer is I wasn't old enough to appreciate the satire. I expected serious horror movie and wasn't prepared to ride the roller coaster of blood, guts, humor, and statement that this movie was full of. Now over 10 years later, Dead Alive stands out to me as a sheer genius work of film. The gore and zombies are so over the top that they are hilarious. The extreme nature of the events that unfold are a brilliant contrast to the serious horror movie that seeks to outdo its rivals by showing more disgusting and terrifying deaths while trying to keep a delicate balance of not seeming corny or unrealistic. Dead Alive throws those expectations out the door and goes well past and beyond the limits of good taste. The scene where Lionel is trying to escape the foyer full of zombies only to be unable to run because of the gore coated floor, producing a ""Scooby Doo"" running in place effect is just wonderfully cheesy. Also the attempt to treat the zombie baby as a real person by taking it to the park is a side-splitting attempt at humor. And who could not crack up at the ""divine intervention"" provided by Father McGruder in the cemetery. This is one for the ages, almost ranking up there with Evil Dead 2.",Dead Alive
459,jpgore,You've got.......The Bite !,10,17 January 2006,"You've got.......The Bite ! This should be added to the list of quotes. This is obviously a cult classic. I was turned on to this movie back in 1995. I've since seen the classic at least 100 times. I bought the DVD which is part of my collection. Since 2002, when my youngest son turned 8 - we've always had movie night. He was going through my collection and asked if he could watch it - at first, I was thinking this really isn't the type of movie for an eight year old, but we decided to watch it anyway. Well this eventually became one of his favorites. We've seen this movie together dozens of times, and it's still a classic. We both have most of the lines down that we can probable act out the whole move. Our other favorite all time movie line came from this - ""You're mother ate my dog"" always makes us die laughing. Peter Jackson rules.",Dead Alive
460,MovieMike27,I love this film!!!,10,5 February 2015,"This is in my opinion the best zombie film out there! The effects they used back then are just mind blowing especially in the digital age we are in now where practical effects are nearly a lost art. From the stop motion animation to the quirky color of the blood used, this is an absolute gem! I would love to see this film re-made by Peter Jackson himself or at least produce it, but part of me likes keeping it secret so when a friend needs a good recommendation I can break Braindead out and relive the experience every time. Even after all his success with LOTR and The Hobbit, I will always come back to this as Peter Jacksons best work. A total box office failure because a true cult classic among horror fans.",Dead Alive
461,danweiss-1,Brilliant Zombie Movie,10,12 April 2006,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* This has got to be my favourite film of all time. This extremely gory splatter film is from Peter Jackson who most people will know from the 'lord of the rings' films.The film is about a wimpy man named Lionel who lives with his overprotective mother. When he starts seeing the local showgirl Paquita his mother does not like it and follows them to a zoo. The mother then gets bitten by a rat monkey, turns into a zombie and all hell breaks loose. The film has a brilliant scene with a lawnmower.This film is like no film I have ever seen before and is very funny and inventive. I think it is Peter Jackson's best film.",Dead Alive
