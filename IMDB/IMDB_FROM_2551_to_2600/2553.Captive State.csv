0,SnoopyStyle,better than expected,7,12 June 2019,It's 9 years after an alien invasion. Many cities have underground alien sections as they drain the earth's resources. The world's governments have surrendered to alien control. Gabriel Drummond is trying to survive and escape out of walled-off Chicago. His parents were killed at the outbreak of the invasion and his older brother Rafe was lost participating in an insurgent attack. William Mulligan (John Goodman) was his father's police partner and is tracking the insurgency for the alien overlords.This is pretty good sci-fi for a lesser budget fare. It lacks the big action or extensive CGI. The alien design is a little silly with the porcupine. I expected going underground to see the alien world but the movie ends a little abruptly. It's like the movie ran out of money before running into some heavy CGI scenes. The leads are fine and Goodman is good once again. This movie is definitely punching above its weight.,Captive State
1,Prismark10,The fracking overlords,5,15 June 2019,"Captive State should had been an interesting alien resistance movie. Director Rupert Wyatt turns it into a listless dour movie with a fuzzy plot.There has been alien invasion and the governments of the world realise they cannot defeat the invaders so they cooperate with them. The humans of planet Earth has been colonised and made to work hard.Captive State is set nine years later in Chicago. William Mulligan (John Goodman) is the detective who is after an insurgent group. One of whom is presumed dead but turns up alive. These resistance fighters have an elaborate plan to destroy the aliens during a unity rally. The aliens what we see of them who look a bit like spiky spider type creature.The film keeps many of the characters shallow, the plot is kept murky so it can deliver its plot twist. After a sombre beginning the film does pick up pace eventually.",Captive State
2,claudio_carvalho,"Bleak, Messy and Overrated",3,23 June 2019,"After a massive alien attack, mankind surrenders to avoid annihilation. Nine years later, the civilization is divided in collaborators and resistance force while the aliens explore and deplete the underground of Earth.""Captive State"" is a bleak, messy and overrated sci-fi without action film. The low-budget associated to a terrible screenplay make a boring but intriguing film. The invasion is presented in fast pace and then the alien race move underground to avoid the expensive use of special effects. The one-dimension characters are not well developed and the viewer spends 1h 49 min running time expecting something to happen but even the conclusion is disappointing. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""A Rebelião"" (""The Rebellion"")",Captive State
3,nogodnomasters,Beware of Greeks bearing Gifts,7,25 March 2019,"Aliens take over the world, wall off major cities and exploit our resources. There are humans who side with the aliens to keep the peace. They point to the booming economy, low unemployment, and low crime. Also, Congress is no longer divided.Commander William Mulligan (John Goodman) leads the battle against insurgents who want to still battle the aliens. The film also centers on Gabriel Drummond (Ashton Sanders) a young man who is part of the Phoenix resistance. (Dumbledore's army?) Things come to a head at a gathering at Soldier's Field.The film reminded me of 1984 plus aliens. It is the question of humanity swapping freedom for security. Each of us has their own comfort zone. The speech at Soldier's Field reminded me of a modern political figure who boast economic numbers while usurping power from Congress. There was no background character development until the end, and that was by design. However, it had the effect of making the film boring as you are unable to connect with the characters until the credit roll. Certainly, a film that would be better on the second viewing. Characters were on the wooden side, par for science fiction.Guide: No sex or nudity. A woman in the film is a prostitute. Don't recall any F-words.",Captive State
4,kosmasp,Allegory,6,15 March 2021,"A different kind of Alien invasion - not the actual invasion is on the forefront, but what or how things would evolve if they made us their ... workers. And you may recognize patterns here that have been used by humans before. So these aliens here seem to be quite the dictators ... and humans fall either into line or rebel against the oppression and against the being used as slaves.There is enough tension here and there are enough eerie scenes (of people being taken away, without anyone doing anything - or being able to do anything) ... and some may enjoy the ... I'll call them highlights more than others. The movie had me at the start but lost me a bit towards the middle ... certain character choices (cliche) didn't help either.Overall decent, but not as great as I imagined this could have been, all things considered.",Captive State
5,oscaralbert,If you study the cast listing for this flick . . .,7,18 March 2019,". . . you'll find only one current day Real Life American political party mentioned, and it is NOT the one with the cute donkey mascot. While only a single cast member is officially designated as a deplorable Pachyderm Party Plunderer, it's clear that CAPTIVE STATE suggests that the already unrecognizable Lincoln Brigade is going to complete its murderous mutation and morph into a Freedom-ravishing band of ""Roaches"" within the coming decade. Though the Insect Defamation League and the Vermin Defense Council both have cried ""foul"" on behalf of the USA's cockroach population, these CAPTIVE STATE critics should take a closer look at the film. There are several CAPTIVE STATE scenes which get ""up close and personal"" with these so-called ""Roaches,"" and their smirking mugs actually resemble those of the U.S. Senate majority much more closely than something in any entomologist's collection. CAPTIVE STATE forecasts that the Pachyderm Party infestation already has become so entrenched the We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Working Stiff Citizens can only reclaim our Homeland through such desperate measures as self-sacrificing explosions and a total purge of the Roaches' enabling Fifth Columnist Fellow Travelers.

6,view_and_review,Enjoyed it Overall,7,18 March 2019,"I went into this movie largely blind. I saw a trailer but either I wasn't paying much attention or it didn't really give away anything. In either case I was a bit shocked at the opening scene when these aliens decimated a married couple.""Captive State"" was an alien invasion movie. Where this was different than most such movies was that the human beings surrendered. With the surrender of all humanity it ushered in a new era of an alien ruled earth with lower crime and lower unemployment. Police largely acted on behalf of the aliens called ""the legislature."" This is not to indicate that Earth was some blissful place because it was anything but.This movie tears you in different directions emotionally and mentally. The fighter in me wanted to see a widespread all-out attack on our new masters but the self-preservationist in me wanted peace and security. It's a gritty movie with a series of small subtle movements. The little coordinated movement of would be insurgents was gripping. The movie conveyed a sense of the magnitude of the takeover as well as the extent of the alien grip on society.In some ways the movie was frustrating simply because of my own expectations. Once I let go of my expectations I was able to let the movie take me where it wanted to take me. Overall I enjoyed it even if the American in me was looking for some more fireworks.",Captive State
7,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,2,8 June 2019,"Captive State is unevoking and dull, lacking the basics.No star of the film, no character development, no reason to be made or any standout moment. Only the human side of the story's explained and that's not good enough, since you don't care about them. A bunch of random people come together to accomplish a mission, with minimal dialogue. The viewer's just thrown in watching dullness, to have it pieced together at the end.",Captive State
8,Wizard-8,Too muddled to be effective,3,10 October 2019,"Though the core of this story - humanity resisting total and absolute rule by aliens from another planet - is nothing new, I was willing to sit through another rehash, since there are definitely still some possibilities to be made from this idea. However, this particular execution is not very well done at all. I didn't mind the lack of action and special effects as some other IMDb users have, but the storytelling is an absolute mess. There are a lot of questions that are brought up but are never given any or enough explanation at all. Why is technology in this world at an analogue level? Why are video files being destroyed? How exactly are the aliens governing the world in a way that makes many humans happy? Why do the aliens want humanity to construct gigantic underground chambers for them?These are just some of the many questions that aren't answered. When it comes to the main story, things are just as badly botched. The story seems to be trying to do too much in just 109 minutes, and as a result we get very little character development. The story is further hurt by really bad editing and direction at times, making you wonder every so often what has just unfolded in front of your eyes. It's pretty easy to see why the distributor didn't push this movie too hard when it released it to theaters (and why the movie didn't attract much of an audience.) Not a captivating moviegoing experience.",Captive State
9,siderite,"A combination of good acting, fresh story, low budget and no point",7,9 June 2019,"This is already a genre: the occupation genre, yet while it makes sense for Nazi Germany, it does little for interstellar alien species. The resources of Earth? puh-lease. But, hey, I get it, we need to freshen up the already tired French Resistance cliche, so we get movies like this. Once you get over that little hurdle, Captive State is a decent film. Well acted, with a rather transparent intrigue, but interesting. A bit too long for my taste, though. The only thing left is the ending, which achieves the goal declared at the beginning at the movie, but it pretty much dooms us all. Why? Because of interstellar alien species!! OK, maybe getting over that hurdle is not that easy.",Captive State
10,ThomasDrufke,Beware of Greeks Bearing Gifts,5,25 March 2019,"Captive State is an interesting film. It's both frustratingly confusing and narratively intriguing, once the final frame cuts to black. Because ultimately it may take more than one viewing to appreciate what director Rupert Wyatt was going for. We know he's a capable filmmaker after what we brought to us with 'Apes' in 2011, but his vision with Captive State is so muttered with a convoluted script. As I said with this weekend's 'Us', even with the flaws, I'm glad these types of films are being made. At the very least it will challenge moviegoers to commit to narratives that are more complex and less-structured than your average blockbuster. Captive State certainly falls into that category.5.5/10",Captive State
11,westsideschl,Made Little Sense,3,27 June 2019,"Really bad science: The alien physiology made no sense especially how quickly they adapted to our gravity & O2 levels. And, aliens have been looking very similar from one movie to another for years now. I wonder if they do it on purpose, or maybe attend the same beauty school. The flying spaceship rock also makes no sense, but looks cool. It, or something very similar, has also been done in past alien movies.
The main plot of humans selling out w/enclaves of dissidents has also been done before, but this script left enough holes in the plot to embarrass even a Swiss cheese. Nothing cheaper in film than lots of screen time showing people running around in abandoned warehouses, and back streets.",Captive State

14,cruise01,Boring and forgettable.,2,13 June 2019,"Captive State (1 out of 5 stars).Captive State is horrible in about every way for a science fiction thriller. It was really difficult to even get into from the start of the film. Once you push through hoping for something good to come out of it. The sad answer is there is nothing good coming your way besides a spiral of boredom. A film that lacks character/story development, dull direction, and a script that handles a story that is very much uninteresting. It has that plot were the metaphor takes place of most of the story. It makes sense but there is nothing exciting about it without giving away spoilers. It may have some political themes thrown in there and try to relate if the world was invaded by aliens. And the aliens won and humans surrendered. How will the government react and handle the rest of civilization? The plot takes place in a Chicago city. The aliens are dictating the laws for humans. While the aliens are inhabiting underground, consuming Earth's resources. A group of humans are trying to rebel against the government and aliens. Trying to cause an uprising. Enough said about the plot. While the rest of the story feels like a propaganda on trying to rise up. And most of it is metaphorically.The film lacks character development. The good guys like Gabriel (Ashton Sanders), Rafe (Jonathan Majors), and so on. There is not much development to even care for the good guys. They are forgettable. John Goodman playing William, an officer who is on the hunt for these rebels is also forgettable. Vera Farmiga talent was also wasted on here as well.The film does have a twist in the ending that ties the whole plot together. But the plot was just so stupid that even the twist does not leave you feeling anything about the rest of the movie. The direction and music score is so dull and grim.Overall, Captive State is a horrible film. The plot is dull. The characters are one dimensional and forgettable. The direction and script were all over the place with the story that does not leave any exciting impact. It is boring throughout.",Captive State
15,eddie_baggins,A thrill-less Sci-Fi event,2,24 January 2021,"Hey guys, do you remember the 2019 sci-fi/thriller Captive State from Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt?It's ok if you don't, actually it would be surprising if you did, so forgotten and unloved was Wyatt's mid-budget offering that the film has never even made its way to Australian shores either via way of a cinematic release or VOD release.At once stage looking like one of those original concept genre mash-ups that if done well could be seen as both an analogy of our times or just a straight up sci-fi yarn, Captive State arrived with little to no fanfare on its way to piddling box office results and poor critical and audience feedback and upon final viewing of this finished product, its safe to say the film got exactly what it deserved.Almost thrill free and offering audiences nothing to grasp a hold of in a character sense or setting sense, this Chicago based affair that imagines a world where alien lifeforms have overtaken our hierarchy and humans must obey their rulings, alongside a Big Brother like landscape where humans every move and moment is watched and observed, State fails to utilise, any of its ample ideas or capable cast members to great effort as Wyatt once more delivers disappointing results in the directors chair.After great moments with his breakthrough prison movie The Escapist and then with Hollywood heavyweight The Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Wyatt has been meandering in the Hollywood system with TV show work and forgettable efforts like The Gambler with hopes originally that this effort would be the type of film to bring him back into the light.Unfortunately State is a charisma free affair, devoid of any moments of memorable spectacle, unable to provide us with any interesting characters and plodding along at such a miserable pace that you wonder if the genre of thriller is completely wrong for this escapade that will have sci-fi nuts hungry for other similar products that do the job much better and thriller fans bored witless by a film that seemed like the result of some good ideas hastily put together into a film that doesn't know what it wants to be.Final Say -A hugely disappointing and lame affair, Captive State has the shell of a good film but that's it; the rest of the finished product we are left with is an offering that fails to give us a reason too care.1 sim card out of 5",Captive State
16,Tweetienator,Like A Corpse Patched Together by Frankenstein,5,30 May 2019,"The good stuff about Captive State is that the movie tries to provide something new and unique (style of storytelling, visuals) and got a good production and cast, but there is also a heavy downside - almost everything we watch and follow seems to be taken from some alien invasion movie/show that we already know too well (e.g. the rebels and collaborates theme etc.). Or e.g. the procedure of the rebels to carry out their mission is taken from every spy and/or crime movie on earth. In this sense the movie contradicts itself - trying to provide a unique style but borrowing all the time from all imaginable alien-invasions and spy movies on this earth - the whole body (movie) is made by fragments and pieces of already well known ideas. Also, the end is a rather unsatisfying one - the aliens cannot spot/detect their own technology...To sum it up: Captive State is a mixed experience. For certain not a must watch but also not an absolute fail - just don't expect too much action going on or a (even the twist is just too predictable) unique story.",Captive State
17,damianphelps,Goodman Owns This,7,11 January 2021,"Very stylish and cool movie that really makes you feel like you are there, under pursuit/surveillance, in danger, fighting for your existence.This could be any 'state' where a region is occupied by an aggressive agent, this time it happens to be aliens.Throws up some great moments that I won't spoil.However the element I really want to stress is the performance of Goodman, he is simply stellar in this!",Captive State
18,matthewssilverhammer,Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad,1,22 March 2019,"Captive State is the kind of high-minded sci-fi that's so obnoxiously low on entertainment value that it's shocking it ever made it to theaters. Like a Netflix original movie that the company chose to bury under copious reruns of ""The Office"", it barely exists in the minds of the public, and that is totally fine. It's a convoluted and boring alien invasion drama that spends its abundant runtime (wait...it was only 100 minutes???) bluntly beating us over the head with its class warfare themes.
The film opens with a family being attacked by a small swarm of bug-like extra-terrestrials in a city tunnel. It's a decent little suspense scene from which the movie never comes close to replicating. Instead, it bogs the screen down with hideous visuals, illegible action and colorless characters, desperately trying to make us care about the new social order this alien race (who are shrouded in oppressive darkness) has created, and root for a small faction of dissidents (who have as much personality as an extra on ""NCIS"") trying to bring an end to the oppression. By the end, the story has devolved into complete confusion; not because the movie requires complexity but simply because it's being told so poorly. It's a critical cliché, but it really is a hot mess.
However, unlike most messes, this one isn't interesting; it's just utterly disposable. As soon as the film starts, you're sure a ""twist"" is coming (there is), and even more sure that you will be disappointed by it (you will be). Even with a large Diet Coke and a bag of Sour Patch Kids, I found it hard to stay awake. If you wanna see a criminally underrated sci-fi film about class, go see Alita.",Captive State

20,subxerogravity,Not as Captive as it needs to be.,5,16 March 2019,"It's an interesting political thriller with the dressing of a Sci-fi movie, that's overall mediocre and it has the tendency to get real dull at times, sometimes so dull you'll... ""miss"" it's attempts to be cleaver and intelligent.It's a mystery that needs to be unraveled, but too many elements in it are not really needed. Lots of stuff met to make you look the other direction so you don't see it coming, it technically works too well cause by the time I come back from looking the other way I forget what was directly ahead of me, and they had me looking too long in the other direction that I no longer care what's right in front of me.The sci-fi backdrop was a cool idea. The visual elements of the movie is what really makes it feel Sci-Fi. The story happening in front of you makes this a political thriller about a resistance group planing a terrorist attack, while certain small visual tones behind it make you remember that this movie has aliens in it. It's literally an alien invasion story that's not about the aliens.Captive State is trying too much and not succeeding in all it's attempts. A very cleaver idea not full flushed out.",Captive State
21,Turfseer,"Twist ending climax of sci-fi alien occupation allegory is great despite long-winded, convoluted second act",6,27 March 2019,"Captive State is a film that I went back and saw a second time because there was so much I missed the first time around. Many reviewers focused on the film as an allegory about authoritarianism but missed the core of what the narrative was really all about-a Twilight Zone-like sci-fi thriller with a powerful twist ending. If you don't realize that there's a twist ending involved here, much of the story will appear quite convoluted--the pronouncement in fact of many reviewers who simply couldn't follow a good deal of the plot. I'm going to go ahead and reveal what the twist is all about here so if you haven't seen the film, you might wait until you do and then read this review.
Some of you might recall the film Alien Nation or the TV series of the same name. Captive State is sort of a reverse Alien Nation-instead of the aliens arriving on earth and ending up as a discriminated minority, the aliens here immediately crush the military might of all the countries on earth and set themselves up as a group of deadly overseers, much akin to the Nazi occupiers in Vichy France during World War II.
The story is set in Chicago in the year 2027, nine years after the alien invasion. The aliens have constructed a ""closed zone"" in the middle of the city and exist way underground, rarely making an appearance on earth's surface (the aliens look like giant, powerful insects who communicate by using a clicking sound which has been utilized in a host of other past sci-fi productions featuring insect-like aliens).
Just as in Vichy France, the populace is ruled by a group of collaborators, who enforce the rules of the aliens who have dubbed themselves ""legislators."" The aliens have outlawed all digital communication, so the media utilized are reminiscent of the kind of analog communication that went on in the 70s and 80s, prior to the advent of smart phones and the internet (for example, pictures are taken with Polaroid cameras).
One of the protagonists, Gabriel (Ashton Sanders), works on a factory that saves the digital data for the aliens but destroys the chips and media card the data is stored on. The part of Gabriel is a weak one and notably at a certain point in the film, the character disappears for twenty minutes and you wonder what happened to him. Suffice it to say, Gabriel is protected by a former police detective and now head of internal security for the collaborators, William Mulligan (played by a taciturn but rather good John Goodman). Mulligan proves to be the most interesting character in the film. He's trying to protect the rebellious Gabriel from falling afoul of alien rule as Mulligan was friends with Gabriel's father, also a detective prior to the invasion.
The real bulk of the action concerns a conspiracy of rebels who communicate with one another often by placing print ads in newspapers. They refer to a ""Number One,"" the leader of the group who is to somehow become unwittingly the alien's trusted agent and set off a bomb while welcomed into their lair. Most of the conspirators are unaware who Number One is. The twist is that Mulligan, who appears to be the #1 collaborator, is actually the #1 conspirator, entrusted with setting off the bomb deep in alien headquarters underground.
A good part of the film involves the conspiracy to set off a bomb at Soldier field, where a collaborator unity rally is being held. The allegorical nature of the story is made clear during this rally where a complacent public is depicted as submissive, lulled into believing the aliens have brought unity to the planet.
This is where the film loses focus--because if you don't realize that the conspirators are all on a suicide mission and their plan is designed to fail, you will find a good deal of what happens before you, confusing (to put it mildly). It's Mulligan who is made to look good as he seemingly uncovers the conspiracy and eliminates it-all designed to impress the aliens, who put him in charge as Acting Commissioner at the surprising climax. Since the Commissioner is the only one allowed to enter the Closed Zone, Mulligan is seen at film's entry headed down into the alien lair, about to set off his bomb.
Captive State has a great twist ending but might have worked better as a one hour cable TV episode as part of a sci-fi series. In the end, the second act machinations are too convoluted and confusing with the entire plot involving the conspiracy (which turns out to be a staged set-up) proving to be not so exciting with rather predictable scenes of annihilation by alien entities who have come out of their cocoon deep underground.
Captive State is filled with clues throughout to suggest things aren't really what they seem. Look for the ""trojan horse"" illustration on the wall at the prostitute's home. Also note that Mulligan tells Gabriel right before his final mission, that ""maybe"" the plan all along, was DESIGNED to fail. And finally, traces of the bomb (made out of phosphorescent material) are seen flashing briefly on Mulligan's back right before he goes into the contraption that sends him into the belly of the beast.
Captive State is certainly worth a look (or even a second one), despite a poorly edited and drawn out second Act, since the climax wields a powerful punch.",Captive State
22,dfranzen70,Just so tortuous,4,12 November 2019,"This looks like it would be a tense sci-fi movie about invading aliens and the plucky humans who rebel against them. But it's not, not really. The premise is solid (see first half of first sentence), but the execution is lacking. There are far too many characters, which means not much time spent on any one of them, and there are so many different threads that the viewer quickly gets lost in trying to track everyone. John Goodman plays a police commissioner trying to quell the rebellion on behalf of our new alien overlords, known as the Legislators, who have taken over the planet. A plot was hatched against them but failed, with the perpetrators believed to have perished in the attempt. Goodman's William Mulligan isn't so sure. But the overarching problem with the movie is that it never allows the viewer to really become invested in anyone's cause, whether it's the captive humans or those collaborating with the mean ol' aliens. And, for a sci-fi movie, there really isn't much action to speak of. The rare action scenes are Earthling based; heck, we hardly ever see the invaders themselves (it's okay; this is a treatise of man turning on man, with the aliens kind of secondary characters at best). The result is that the movie feels disjointed, distant, and pointless, and the direction is so haphazard and muddled that it's difficult to really get a sense of what's happening and what it all means, even in the mild context of the movie itself. Because of the deficiencies of the script and the direction, watching this movie was a tedious experience.",Captive State

This is a weird little sci_fi movie. I like weird. I like sci_fi. But this one just didn't work for me. It seemed like a first attempt by someone making a movie-it was ok but it seems like it's missing something. It was almost good. The story takes place about 9 years after an alien invasion, and the aliens have won. They are in charge and have subjugated the humans. Some of the humans are collaborators and some are dissidents-they don't like the aliens and want to fight back. The problem is, there are humans that will rat you out to the aliens so you have to be careful. John plays a policeman that goes after the rowdy humans that plan terrorist attacks against the aliens. Vera plays a hooker that John sees occasionally. Ashton and Jonathan play brothers that happen to fall on the rowdy humans side of the fence. The aliens are interesting to look at but they are not shown very much-FYI: I did notice special make up effects by Greg Nicotero in the credits, for you Walking Dead fans. Most of the movie is about who can trust who and what is really going on. Like I said, it's interesting but a little drab.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence & action, language, drug material and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I'd rent it either. If you really want to watch it, I would wait until it comes to cable.",Captive State
25,CubsandCulture,novel take on alien invasion but script fails its big ideas,6,16 March 2019,"Set long after the initial invasion and mostly concerned with the logistics of what guerrilla fighting would look like under alien occupation this is refreshing take on the space invaders subgenre. The film's focus and plotting around how humans would conduct terrorist attacks is at once subversive and sociologically relevant. The plotting was mostly plausible, through I imagine the big twist at the end is something of cheat. (It seems unnecessary in how many steps were involved). In any case, the film's low-key focus is a nice break from the bamboozle that makes up this subgenre. The film plays much more like a thriller than an action film. But, alas, the film focuses on the details and misses the big strokes.The aliens are utterly nebulous. Their motives, actions and basic social structures are entirely unclear. On a plot level this is largely OK; the various twists and turn of the plot keep the issue in the background. But it makes it very hard to nail down what sort of allegory the film is trying to make. The aliens stand in for a pretty unspecific authoritarianism and/or police state. This unspecified symbolism is empty. It renders the film hollow and frankly a little dull. This really isn't a film that calls out to be re-watched due to this issue.Wyatt directs with a docudrama feel that adds to the film's interest in the logistics of resistance. It is generally effective. Wyatt does a good job of using the film's limited budget to his advantage. The aliens are never really clearly shown; while the use of shadow to hide the (relatively) low budget is an old trick I found its use effective here. He gets good performances from his cast. Goodman, while giving an engaging performance, doesn't quite sell a central tension of his character. The final film is weakened because of that.This was a good idea that didn't make it off the page well.",Captive State

28,sauravjoshi85,"Slow, confusing and boring.",3,30 March 2021,"Captive State is a Science fiction action movie directed by Rupert Wyatt and stars John Goodman, Ashton Sanders, Jonathan Majors, Colson Baker and Vera Farmiga.We have seen many alien invasion movies in the past in which some had become great and classic movies and rest died their own natural death and with immature handling doubled by slow and confusing screenplay the movie is nothing but another example of a badly executed movie.The movie starts from the time when earth is already invaded by the extra terrestrials and nothing has been depicted as how, why and when they came to earth. The movie is primarily based on aliens but you will barely gets a chance to see them and very often seen as the blurry vision of spider like mammoth creatures.The screenplay of the movie is confusing boring and slow infact very slow and after a point you will feel that you are watching the movie since ages.Acting is average to good as the characters hadn't got a chance to display their work and you could blame it on the poor execution of characters.The climax of the movie is hurriedly written and made as I was expecting a better climax to sign off as I thought that the humans will fight with the aliens to get their earth back.Overall a utterly disappointing and boring movie with lackluster execution and an unconvincing ending.",Captive State

30,dworldeater,"Good sci fi, a nice surprise",7,5 August 2019,"Captive State is a surprise for me. I went into this with low expectations, but ended up getting engrossed in the story and digging the film. Even though it has a PG 13 rating, it does not diminish the dark tone or seriousness of the movie. Captive State is a post alien invasion movie which deals with the aftermath of the aliens as an occupying force that infiltrated the government and controls society. This is a bleak setting with most of the populace living in poverty and squalor and is focused on the
underground opposition trying to overthrow the occupying force. The acting is good with a lesser known cast with John Goodman as the lead. The special f/x are good, but this movie is more about the story and the characters fortunately. Captive State is based on The French Resistance in WW2, but the film brings this in a sci fi setting, with plot twists and a gritty style brings to mind lots of great classic dystopian science fiction and that is certainly not a bad thing in my book.",Captive State
31,peterp-450-298716,I was enthusiastic when I saw the trailer. Now I feel disappointed.,4,22 June 2019,"Light a match.
Ignite a war.When I saw the trailer of ""Captive State"" for the first time, I was immediately overenthusiastic. It seemed like a suspenseful and action-rich Science Fiction about extraterrestrial dominance and their reign. I already imagined myself a kind of movie as ""Independence Day"" or ""War of the Worlds"", with a sophisticated storyline as presented in ""Arrival"". Added to this is the existence of a rebellion of individuals against this alien occupation. And last but not least, they managed to get John Goodman to play one of the key roles. The very first thing that occurred to me was that I certainly wouldn't let this film pass me by. This film was the reward after having to watch crap movies as ""Occupation"" and to a lesser extent ""Beyond skyline"". After seeing this ""as I imagined"" incomparable film, I had to conclude that my enthusiasm had dropped below freezing.I'm sure there was a shrewd story somewhere deeply hidden. And yes, the ending was ingeniously conceived. But you have to wait an enormous amount of time before you realize what's really going on. The entire setup only becomes clear at the very last minute. That means you have to have a good portion of endurance. Because this movie isn't really captivating (pun not intended). It's rather confusing and vague. And if you're eager to see aliens at work, you'll be disappointed as well. There are only a few vague, dark images. Not that it's really necessary. The opening scene with the parents of young Gabriel (Ashton Sanders) and Rafe (Jonathan Majors) being pulverized, shows already how all-destructive and invincible these cosmic rascals are. The rest of the film you see those creatures in semi-darkness while producing creepy insect-like sounds. They look like a giant cactus. And you'll also see a kind of flying drones with a flesh-like suction cup. However, their function wasn't entirely clear to me. Well, there were more unclear things.The originality of this film lies in the relationship between humanity and these invaders. In one way or another, they've managed to make humanity take a submissive attitude. The choice was probably limited: accept their authority or total destruction. The result is a run-down society that tolerates despotic rules. The aliens have buried themselves in the centers of world cities behind an immense wall where only certain authorized persons are allowed access (To receive instructions and report on the situation, I suppose.). These ""closed zones"" serve as mines to plunder earth's resources. After the intriguing start, however, the film falls into a politically charged story about limited civil rights, economic decline and bureaucratic juggling in which privileged people are richly rewarded for their cooperation. The emergence of a resistance movement is a natural result. But it's brutally suppressed.And that's where John Goodman comes in. He's a detective who's determined to clean up the ""Phoenix"" group once and for all. He follows Gabriel's movements in order to track down and eliminate these resistance fighters. Everything for the greater good. All in all, this entire operation is initially fairly incoherent and difficult to follow. His relationship with a prostitute (Vera ""The Conjuring"" Farmiga) seemed unimportant at the beginning. The use of alien explosive technology wasn't really clear to me either. And wasn't it so that the entire human civilization was stripped of any technological ingenuity? Gabriel's work included, for example, the systematic destruction of SIM cards from mobiles. And yet the law enforcement agencies work with a sophisticated tracking system and face recognition. Or was this a technology from the alien rulers? In terms of communication, they made more progress than in ""Arrival"". Here, there are already interpreters who actually understand and translate the clicking, scraping, and hissing of the aliens.Again, I understand that with the ultimate revelation everything becomes clearer. And when the ultimate message hits in, you'll be awestruck. But almighty, you cannot really call the film fascinating. Perhaps you watch it rather passively because you're kept in the dark for so long. The film deals with aspects such as resistance movements, political compromises, and self-sacrifice for the greater good. I don't expect a film which tackles the subject of an extraterrestrial invasion, to focus only on these aspects. Yet again another proof that trailers aren't always an accurate representation of the final film.",Captive State
32,questl-18592,Captive Audience,3,29 December 2020,"I love the idea of this movie. So often in these sorts of films we experience the alien invasion right at the beginning. Alien forces make contact, battle ensues and just when humanity is on the brink they rally together and triumph over the alien invaders. Well not this time! Captive State kicks us off some time after the aliens landed and started taking control and we get to experience the lives of these people trying to get by in the new world being created.That sounds like a fun concept, right? I thought so too. Shame the movie can't figure out how to make it work. It's such a mess, it's a little preachy, clunky and just frustrating to watch. I was getting actively annoyed watching this and the fact that it took a potentially fun concept and just ruined it was even more frustrating. Possibly the biggest issue and example of the missed potential is in how utterly forgettable this is. It took all of 20 minutes after the credits had rolled for every bit of this to fall out of my head.This isn't worth your time. It's upsetting because of how badly it misses on a fascinating concept only to create something entirely forgettable and uninspired. Don't bother seeking this one out, there's nothing here worth the time or even to qualify it as backgrourd noise,",Captive State
33,valleyjohn,Nothing to see here,5,6 October 2020,"There have been hundreds of alien invasion films . Some great , some ok but most forgettable. Captive State falls firmly into the latter.Set in a Chicago neighborhood nearly a decade after an occupation by an extra-terrestrial force, ""Captive State"" explores the lives on both sides of the conflict - the collaborators and dissidents.It doesn't matter how great a film looks or how big the movie star you have in it , if a story is dull , there's not a lot you can do about it . Captive State is incredibly dull.The film is set years after an invasion and it felt like I had missed the important years ! We don't ever see much of the aliens because by now they've hidden themselves underground - great .All we have is a semi political story that takes every cliche from previous alien invasion films and bombards the audience with gamma rays of tedium.It has a slight feel of a Cloverfield film but I'm not sure if that's because it stars John Goodman ? It certainly isn't as good as Cloverfield or any of its spin offs .After an hour I had completely lost interest in the increasingly complicated plot or was it complicated because I'd lost interest?

34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Captive State,5,20 June 2019,"Aliens that we rarely get to glimpse and are almost in the background, institute martial law on the human race. That's the layout of the sporadic and spasmodic, Captive State (my latest review).""State"" is yet another PG-13 thriller that takes place in dystopian Chicago, Illinois (this Mud City really needs to take a break from the film biz). Its look is so grubby, so inky, and so sunless, you can barely tell what's going on. Not to promote the essence of Mop & Glo floor cleaner but Captive State sure could have used a cinematic coat of it. When the squishy E.T.'s show up unannounced, you really need to squint to get your view on.Captive State, which features an always reliable John Goodman in one of its leads, has a sense of urgency and can never be deemed as boring. The problem is this fast-paced vehicle lacks continuity with its rookie editor clearly on mock holiday (Andrew Groves has only been involved in shorts, TV movies, and TV series up until this point). Profuse characters (of a serious nature) fade in and out, scenes are storyboard-ed so quickly the viewer never gets a foothold, and Chicago locales like Soldier Field and Wicker Park feel a little too conspicuous to someone who lives there (like myself).Oh well. At least the musical score by Rob Simonsen is disquieting, the Willis Tower is still standing, and scruffy co-star Alan Ruck goes full incognito (his days of playing Cameron Frye and T.S. are long gone). Bottom line: Captive State strives to be intelligent science fiction with a Matt Reeves and Neill Blomkamp flavor. Still, it gives your average conspiracy enthusiast no sound reason to latch on. ""State"" leaves the audience member adrift, lost, and held ""captive"" (ha-ha). Call it ""district nein"" as in ""no"". Rating: 2 stars.",Captive State
35,Easygoer10,Mediocre At Best,4,24 July 2020,"First off, this film was released in March of 2019. As usual, Amazon lists it as newer. I hate that. They are very misleading. As far as the film, the soundtrack was clever. Unfortunately, John Goodman is a highly overrated actor I cannot stand. On the other hand, Vera Farmiga is very talented. Unfortunately, she had a total of 5 minutes screen time (almost a cameo). I enjoyed the real lead of ""Gabriel"" played by an extremely good young actor Ashton Sanders. The film kind of goes in a linear same old same old fashion. The ""creature effects"" were bad; also too understated. Less is more in these cases; however they took this to a new low (pardon the pun). Anyway, I wasted about 2 hours on this excuse for a sci-fi film. I strongly suggest you skip it.",Captive State
36,eric262003,Way Too Crammed With Little Going For It,5,11 April 2021,"Personally, I think the movie ""Captive State"" would've worked better if it was a televised mini-series. With its frugal budget getting in the way and its lack of special effects the cheap factor sure hits its mark in this unfulfilling sci-fi thriller. If it were a mini-series at least we would've had a better narrative, well fleshed out characters and more proper editing and it would've worked out so much better. ""Captive State"" offered way too many story lines, too many characters, lack of development and it quite convoluted in its editing. In the end it was trying to be a combination of ""District 9"" meets ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" and in the end it fails miserably.In the introductory scenes, we get an awkward explanation of how things have come to be in the dystopian atmosphere that has become. Earth has been under a massive alien invasion that rules with a draconian state of mind and we have no choice but to comply. We had unsuccessfully defeated the aggressors, the world has surrendered. They now have succumbed to shell governments and must also report to the ""legislators"" which are the aliens that now rule the Earth. On a global perspective, all major cities have been been forced to create ""closed zones"" designed to position the invaders powers which makes them a vulnerable targets against rebellions.Set in the city of Chicago, ""Captive State"" concentrates on a radical group with their mindset on killing the principal legislator and to go through the closed zone. It also follows the investigation of Police Chief Bill Mulligan (John Goodman) to nab, question and take out the members of this cell. But he is on borrowed time with the legislators, the chief has to take out the threat of the invaders or else, the alien beings will use total tyranny to annihilate and entire section of the city, even at the cost of innocent lives lost.The principal action settings are mostly scene through chases which replaces any overblown or gregarious special effects. The alien creatures do materialize, however they're pretty generic in appearance. To make the atmosphere all the more grim and cynical, the world has succumbed to an eternal darkness where the sun is hardly ever in sight. Under the direction of Rupert Wyatt, he does succeed in maintaining a great level of intensity throughout, however the narrative runs too much at a slow pace to stay invested.As for character development, they really are all fragmented and very scattered to be invested into. They're job is just to come in when the plot is needed for them, like pieces on chessboard. Aside from what is given to the audience, the motives of the characters are esoteric and their background stories are incoherent, with maybe the exception of a clip near the end that extrapolates what we've been watching the whole time. The leading characters Police Chief Bill Mulligan, his resistance leader Rafe Drummond (Jonathan Majors) and his younger brother Gabriel (Ashton Sanders) are lifeless and lack any depth in character or background. With no characters we can fully get invested into is a major disappointment because even though Wyatt created a drab dystopian society where civilians can rebel upon quite effectively, it's just the characters who are fighting the system lack in depth, we simply don't care less about them. When a character meets their demise, we dismiss them not because we're uncaring, but because we know very little about them.The sacrifices to cramming so much material into am almost two hour long film is quite overwhelming. The integrity of the story becomes muddled and all scenarios feel kind of rushed. There were just way too many subplots all happening and very little gets resolved. The ending was quite unpleasing but telling us how it ended without showing us how it ended.The vision of this movie is solid mainly due to the script by Wyatt and his co-writer wife Erica Beeney. Lore about humanity stepping back from an alien invasion has been a timeless symbol of the science-fiction genre. And though ""Captive State"" lacks in anything original in quality, there are some twists that will likely catch you off guard. It does stay low profiled in its commentary regarding the political agenda it hold secretly towards its audience. Though it was never a boring movie in the least, it was still convoluted and was never able to relate to any of the criminals or their lawmakers.",Captive State

The story is based on the alien(s?) who shut down the whole power supply of the world (or nation?) and controlled network for 9 years. After 9 years a group of rebels tracking and hacking it and try to destroy it. The story is in so short and as per my assumption. But not confirmed, because the movie is beyond my brain. A few loopholes too but we have no enough time and logic to look after to pay attention due to confused direction. Very messy story plot movie. I doubt that even director has firm idea about such story. Watch or not it depends up on your brain. If you can understand then you may watch further else stop and play a chase board for brain exercise. Nothing much for acting department. Vera Farmiga is wasted here.

This is one of those films. The first 40 minutes is unengaging, with a series of characters we know little about and care about even less. Slowly but surely it turns the corners, and the hints, which are abundant, begin to make sense.I really liked the aliens who are unlike any aliens we've ever seen before. Kudos to the people who thought this up.In retrospect, the seemingly random flashes of the lives of a dozen people, makes sense and the film makers are trying to give you the feeling of the operations of a cell, where different people are acting independently. It works, but the price is a loss of engagement with any of the characters.Definitely worth a look.",Captive State
40,rockman182,Captive State (2019),5,17 March 2019,"This film had the misfortune of being sandwiched between Captain Marvel and Jordan Peele's Us. I barely saw any promotion for it. Of course though if you have a passion for watching movies, you will find out about it. The film comes from Rupert Wyatt who started the solid modern day Planet of the Apes trilogy. I thought his follow up, The Gambler, was terrible. I usually am a sucker for alien invasion films. It was hard to decipher that from the film trailer though. Seemed for focused on the lead character than the science fiction and unfortunately this film is just that.An alien race has invaded Earth for the past nine years and the humans most adhere to their overlords. In the midst of that is a kid named Gabriel Drummond who wants to be part of the resistance to cause a war against the alien overlords. He is being closely watched by a police officer (John Goodman) who wants to keep the peace going between the alien and human race. The film takes place primarily in a rundown Chicago neighborhood. Vera Farmiga and Machine Gun Kelly (yes indeed) also co star.This film starts off with a really incredible sequence that makes you want to see more of the alien race that has invaded. It very soon devolves into a super incoherent story with such thin characters. Some characters come and go and you wonder who they are. I still don't think I understood key plot points and character actions. Its such a messily shot film and the writing needed to be more graspable but it isn't. Why am I even supposed to care about the lead character's plight?There's not enough action or interaction with the overlord. I think the film gets bogged down in a plot that is too complex that at the end when the ""twist"" is revealed you don't even know or care about what's going on. Its a super misfire on all counts. I know this film will just be forgotten in years to come but I always get a little annoyed when a science fiction film chronicling an alien invasion goes wrong. In the case of Captive State you would rather be held in captivity by the aliens than watch and try to understand this.5/10",Captive State
41,markthomassintek,This is not what you think,7,18 March 2019,"REVIEW - CAPTIVE STATEThere have been a number of films recently when you watch the trailer and the film seems to be one genre but then when you see the actual film it actually is something quite different, a recent example of this was They Came By Night which by the trailer seems to be a fast paced horror but in actual fact turned out to be a slow paced thriller. This film is the same. By the trailer you feel this film is a fast paced resistance alien film but actually it is a lot more.Very similar to a spy film with double agents, twists and turns this is set in Chicago 10 years after an alien invasion but to avoid mass slaughter the worlds governments agreed to be ruled by the legislator.Interesting concept which must have all of your attention from the beginning because clues are there to see (no spoilers).Watching this I actually found it interesting to compare what is happening in the film to Trumpet administration and many of the mass shootings / terrorism in the USA.Watching this film you can certainly imagine if it was a real person leading a country acting in the way the aliens are acting!Sometimes a film comes along which surprises you and not for the reason you watched it in the first place, this is such a film.If a plan to resist failed, was it planned to fail to allow a greater resistance plan to succeed?Rating 7 out of 10",Captive State
42,jrarichards,Yawning gap between ambition and what we actually get to watch,5,7 November 2020,"I like a good dystopia, and the one portrayed here - though pretty derivative - is intriguing enough. We're something like 9 years into it (a la ""Falling Skies"", ""A Quiet Place"" and so on - and frankly that tends to be a frustratingly hard place to start in and of itself). Aliens who come to be known as Legislators are in total control of Earth (though round here that's mainly Chicago). Humans who cooperate with them assert that the incomers have bought peace and jobs and ended America's divisions (which would make them pretty useful right now, BTW). But presumably (in shades of ""V"" and other things we've seen long ago) their long-term plans are grim enough, and in the meantime there's supposed to be no rebellion.Except that there is (though do we really and truly know why???). Yet, boy, do we ever get to see the fine details of how that rebellion works. The film is obsessed with this aspect, and goes extremely step-by-step - and frankly it's as ultimately dull as it is disorientating - given the large numbers of rebels we get to see in various dark, dank and dingy settings doing things that are never quite obvious.""Never quite obvious"" is OK if we are hungry for each scrap of intel we get, and are working hard to put the whole picture together. But sadly I was not, despite being willing at the outset.""Disjointed"" hardly does justice as a description here.""Disappointing"" is the next one that comes to mind.Needless to say, we get to see PRECIOUS little of the hostile (but certainly dispatchable and hence inexplicably non-all-powerful) aliens; and we don't even somehow get full insight into the regime they've established, though this aspect is better than nothing. But those who decry special effects movies have certainly got their just desserts here, as there are very few of them here either, and you'll soon be longing - even begging - for one or two to spice things up.A mournful John Goodman as by far the most familiar face seems the right kind of guy for these dismal settings, and he does OK. But knowing where his character's loyalties lie is challenging, and - to be honest - we don't really care that much, do we?It would be easy to suggest that the opportunities were lost here on account of the budget - but I fear that would be to let (Brit) Rupert Wyatt and (Californian) Erica Beeney off too lightly. The oppression opposed by (mainly invisible and intangible) aliens is not well-defined enough, while the plots of rebels we can't fully identify with are far too well-defined for their own good, among characters that we never build a rapport with. As it happened, I just watched the BBC's hugely-impressive ""Les Miserables"" and saw rebels Eponine, Enjolras, Grantaire and Gavroche die as they oppose a repressive French regime that has left many destitute and with nothing to lose. It's an Alamo-like scene in which the emotion for the viewer is tangible.Pity we can't achieve the same here in an actually-quite-interesting dystopian sci fi context...",Captive State
43,abisio,Unexpected; a movie that will push to deep thinking,8,15 March 2019,"Captive State is about aliens controlling Earth. There concept has been used before but this time the scenario is different and original.
After 10 years of Earth controlled by aliens from outer space, big city become governed by politicians who must personally report to an alien governor leaving underground. As in occupation situations collaborationist are rich and live with luxury while common people are exploited (in this case mining naturally resources from the planet for the invaders.). Invaders also push technology back several years (the movie occurs in 2027 but there is no internet or cellphones or digital technology). Some people formed a terrorist group to get rid of the invaders and shut down the corrupt collaborationist government.
Those expecting an action packed movie with invincibly heroes will be somewhat disappointed. There are some violent scenes but the focus shift to many different people who in their heroic or coward way make up the story.
For those he have no idea how terrorism work; let me explain that this is Terrorism 101. Every basic detail about cells, is explained and or used; as are also the not legal government methods to combat it. However; think for a moment that heroes here are the terrorists.
Acting is quite acceptable. As always, John Goodman in auto pilot carries most of the movie; but the rest of the cast do not fall behind.
The ending; is not Hollywood style and quite dramatic.
In brief; it is not a popcorn movie but one to think about particularly about the situation in many countries",Captive State

45,kuarinofu,Cool 30 mins of story watered by 1 hour of people doing stuff with music,6,10 June 2019,"First of all, beautiful movie. Great cinematography, color correction, nice locations. Looks and feels good for its budget that's for sure.
The first like 40 minutes were almost unwatchable, really messy dialogue combined with people doing stupid things with ""tension"" music playing over. At some point, I thought this was meant to be a comedy or a satire. But no, it's serious.
These first 40 or so minutes were so unfocused I barely understood what was going on. The movie also borrowed from (or was inspired by) the classics, like the Matrix movie (style and color correction) and the idea of resistance from Half-life 2 video game. The latter was very obvious in the style and overall presentation.
After such an introduction the movie gets a little confused and starts moving the plot, kind of, completely abandoning it 30 mins or so later. This really felt like bits of the story were stitched together. It's like the movie had an intro and an outro, almost like a video game.
The twist of the movie becomes fairly obvious after the two important plot devices are introduced, and by the end, it goes slow motion one more time, but at that point, you kind of got used to people doing stuff with music so it's fine.
Not a complete waste of time, and once again, beautifully shot, but I'd really enjoy these characters getting more developed rather than getting 20 min long scenes of people sharing messages in the most stupid ways possible.",Captive State

47,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,28 March 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, especially when it involves alien invasions of some kind, movies like this always leave me excited. It doesn't matter what the audience or critics have been saying (in fact, it never does) because it won't affect my enthusiasm (in fact, nothing does). By knowing who the cast, director, writers, and producers are, I instantly know how high or low I need to set my expectations. Having this in mind, I was hoping that Captive State could be one of 2019's surprises. It has an unusual concept that can provide a very unique story if it's well-told, so the big question is: did they execute all of their ideas successfully?Unfortunately, no. Not even close. Honestly, the screenplay is so convoluted and messy that I felt ""lost"" several times. I admire the amount of work that they put into this because they actually did and it shows. The overall concept and its ramifications are all there, the story is indeed interesting. It's just the way that it's told that ruins the entire thing. However, the first sentence I heard after the film's conclusion, came from someone who said: ""here I was expecting massive action and ..."" If you go into your movie theater expecting a straightforward, action-heavy, alien-invasion-type flick and you leave disappointed, that's on you! From the trailers to its marketing, there was never a message of ""hey, this is pure action, humans vs. aliens!""It tried its best to give the world a different take on this ""sub-genre"", let's call it that. I mean, they had it all: a good cast with the always astonishing John Goodman (William Mulligan) as one of the protagonists, beautiful visual effects that elevated the set design, and the aliens actually have an intriguing physical shape. Sadly, there's barely any aliens throughout the runtime. There's hardly ... anything. I don't know what happened post-production, but it feels like they were pushed to deliver something different, so they cut all of the other scenes with extra-terrestrial stuff (I'm certain that they had more to show).The main issue here is that you can never have a 100% ambiguous story. Arrival is probably the best non-typical alien-invasion movie ever, not because it scarcely shows any aliens or action, but due to its twistful and thought-provoking script. Nevertheless, it still shows a lot! You don't leave that film disappointed because you didn't see the inside of a spaceship or an actual alien. You leave perplexed and with your mind blown. Captive State just leaves you confused and wishing for more. A lot more. There's really not that much more to say on this review without getting into spoiler territory.Sadly, this is one of those movies that come out every year showing tremendous potential, an innovative and intriguing premise, but that in the end, it just isn't able to succeed. It doesn't structure its story and ideas in the most efficient way possible. Its execution is sloppy, filled with hollow characters, no real flow (it feels like it's just a scene after another scene), too vague, and it profoundly hopes that you didn't figure out a pretty obvious twist so they can shock you seconds away from the end. It's not horrible, but it's definitely frustrating and disappointing.John Goodman delivers a great performance as always, and the visual effects are striking, to say the least. The production quality is undeniable, they really worked hard to provide the audience with an environment that actually feels real. The first act is pretty good, but it's downhill from there. Ashton Sanders shares the lead with Goodman, and he's also pretty good, no doubt about it. However, and this sums up the film pretty well: if I have to check online what the name of the main character was (Gabriel Drummond), then something went terribly wrong. It's not going to end up being one of the worst movies of the year, but so far, it's the biggest letdown.",Captive State

As the movie progresses, it becomes a lot more layered and you start to understand the background of the alien invasion and what exactly the rebels are fighting for. The twist at the end sold the movie for me, and I've been thinking about it a lot. John

52,FrenchEddieFelson,Beware of Greeks bearing gifts,6,5 April 2019,"A powerful alien invasion. A surrender to avoid an ineluctable annihilation. The whole humanity under alien domination.After this quick introduction, we elliptically switch nine years later, without really understanding how the human/alien cohabitation works. But this is definitely unimportant. Captive State (2019) is indeed a suspenseful thriller full of undercover agents, spies, policemen and a few aliens, with a profoundly dark and hardly optimistic atmosphere. The story takes place in Chicago in the near future and that, in some respects, looks like Paris, between June 14, 1940 and August 24, 1944, with resistance fighters and collaborators, and with aliens instead of German soldiers.Thus, Captive State (2019) is obviously not an action/war movie, in a science-fiction context. And absolutely not a pop corn movie! The actors (especially John Goodman), the photography, the special effects, the atmosphere, ... that's heavy! Nevertheless, the script is a bit messy. We must wait for the very last scene in order to stick the pieces back together and have a global picture. The making is sometimes clumsy which may confuse the audience. Besides, some people left the movie theater during the screening I attended. Personally, it took me a while to understand and appreciate this story.

54,sweidman-28016,Mediocre Sci Fi Movie with a Messy Plot,4,19 March 2019,"Captive State ReviewSet in a Chicago neighborhood nearly a decade after an occupation by an extra-terrestrial force, Captive State explores the lives on both sides of the conflict - the collaborators and dissidents. I was excited for this movie. The first trailer was vague and I liked it like the Cloverfield trailers. The ratings weren't so great for this movie so I got nervous but I figured that might happen. After reading in why they said it was bad, I didn't think much of it because it's more of a drama and not much alien stuff. After watching it, however, I understand the reviews and I agree. My problem was with the plot and not the direction. Rupert Wyatt did fine with the directing. The plot seems interesting at first. The opening sequence was really cool. It what happens after that made it an actual mess. There's a storyline following Gabriel (Ashton Sanders), William (John Goodman), and a few others. It was interesting but slow. Then at some point it decided to take a turn and now a different plot with new characters. Then it happened one more time. What really didn't help was it didn't explain anything and it was all thrown at the audience. I did like figuring out stuff sometimes, but it was really annoying. It was like jumping to a whole new movie. I will say with the different stories there were some cool and fun scenes to watch. Any of the scenes with the aliens was great. The alien design was really cool and nothing like we've scene. We don't know much about them which helped with the suspense. The visual effects for the movie I will say were terrible and bugged me. They used the same scene with a spaceship going across the water two or three times and it was horrible looking. The aliens looked fine but not great. It was almost like good graphics on a video game, which aren't that great for movies. The cinematography was all handheld so there was some motion sickness but it made it feel a little more real. It reminded me of movies like The Purge and some action movies. The score had a few good pieces but felt generic for a sci fi movie. I'm not saying this was a horrible movie. It just needed some work with the plot. Had there been more explanation and not so many jumps in the plot, it would've been much better. Erica Beeney and Rupert Wyatt co-writing it needed to work on it longer to fine tune it.My Grade: C+",Captive State

Also, ppl in the movie acted like they vaguely knew each other but in the end they all knew each other and were working together? Tot's lost me! Now I know I am not the sharpest tool in the tool shed but , this movie had me wondering why they were doing what they were doing. Aliens were scary as hell, when they did show them that is. Also, they sent ppl away for being bad but didn't show where they ended up. I like a movie to be just half explained, so I am very easy to please but this movie left me with so many questions.

This movie is an original and clever take on alien invasion.There is a very clever subplot (or the main plot?) about the haves and havenots, political propaganda, people drinking the koolaid, rich versus the poor, exploitation, cowardly politicians, man's will to survive, and ordinary women and men willing to sacrifice everything for freedom with a little 1984 thrown in.John Goodman is good at always.

Disappointing, yes, but not below average, pretty much right in the painfully average category.First of all, the positive things about ""Captive State"" include decent, fit-for-a-post-apocalyptic-story cinematography, decent sound and video editing & an arguably great original score. The acting was fine all around, the problem was how the characters were written. However, shamefully, Vera Farmiga has little screen-time & John Goodman doesn't get much to do, despite being one of the main characters. I'm already drifting off to the negatives... The pacing is rather slow & very even, but You've definitely seen worse.Main minus for ""Captive State"" is the story - it's known, narrow, shallow, without much point or twists, weakly written & just plain disappointing. It's the sort of a plot that you'll have forgotten 30 minutes after the closing credits. The characters are rather one-dimensional even though they are visibly trying not to be, nothing impressive in this area. I alse have to mention that this is not an action movie, merely a thriller. It's rather sad that their trailer was better than the movie itself, because it really got me interested before the first ratings appeared.If You just crave a more expensive looking sci-fi, an average Wednesday evening flick, or loved the video game ""Homefront: Revolution"" then this one's for You.

A sci-fi feel of Hitchcock, twilight zone and black mirror having you believe it's taking you to a certain destination of the story flow, but drops you off at destination, you really don't expect to arrive at. A clever slow burner I for one enjoyed. I read some of the negative reviews, written by the pretentious, I so desperately need attention critics, realizing these people have miserable lives.

60,fciocca,An intriguing espionage story set in a distopian future,8,15 September 2019,"Captive State is the demontration that you do not need expensive CGI effects or a really big budgets to do something beautiful. The film is setted after 9 years of a global alien invasion that changed completely society and humans are trying to rebel against this new dictactorship from another universe. The Chicago Rebel Network is trying to restore peace. To do so they will develop a very smart plan, in order to create a very big diplomatic incident that can ruin the agreement between humans and aliens. In this way, a war would begin between the two races.This is not the usual action/scifi movie full of explosions: there are sometimes some dynamic scenes, but the movie focus more on the espionage side. In fact aliens are shown very few times. Clearly they create just the context of the story (we don't even know from where they came from, or how they colonized Earth). There is a lot of tension, and the build up of some scenes is just amazing. You cannot look away from the screen, because you wonder how it will end. There are a lot of twist that most of the time are completely unpredictable.The cast choice is good and it is beautiful when famous actors decide to partecipate to these not-so-blockbuster movies: Vera Farmiga, that appeared in movie such as The Conjuring saga or Godzilla, was a pleasent surprise. Always glad to see John Goodman, which perfomance in 10 Cloverfield Lane for me was memorable. In this movie has confirmed once again to be skillful actor.Movie is entertaining, and very well made. Music is beautiful and always right for every scene: it creates mystery, tension and fear. My final judgement is 8/10.",Captive State
61,DeBBss,An Original Plot With a Terrible Execution,5,29 July 2020,"Alien invasion movies have become very saturated with the same old plots, so naturally, Captive State tries to do something different. If I had to compare Captive State's plot to any another movie's plot, it would be District 9. I like the concept overall, but the execution was absolutely terrible.Captive State takes its narrative all over the place. First with Gabriel Drummond, then to the resistance, then back to Gabriel Drummond. Once the narrative switches, it sticks to that narrative for about 30-45 minutes. Because of that, Gabriel Drummond is a character that gets completely forgotten in the second act. Another issue with the plot is that it's trying to do too much with a runtime of under two hours. There's too many themes and genres that Captive State tries to apply to.The CGI is also pretty bad. In some scenes, it's okay, but in other scenes, it's noticeably bad. Now I can't really blame the filmmakers due to their rather ""low budget"", but when you compare Captive State with other low budget movies, Captive State looks really bad.Captive State had a great concept, but the screenplay ultimately ruined the original plot. There were too many themes going on with a narrative that's never consistent; and because of that, Captive State felt very messy. And with its lackluster CGI, it makes Captive State look very low budget and cheap. Overall, Captive State was a disappointment in my books.",Captive State

63,movieman6-413-929510,"Nice known idea, but bad effect. end result",4,20 May 2019,"Captive State is a new Sci-Fi thriller directed and partly written and produced by Rupert Wyatt, the director of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and The Escapist.In the film, a neighborhood in Chicago has been taken over by aliens for almost a decade. People are being held captive here. The people are observed by the aliens, who can follow the people via GPS chips that they have introduced to the residents of the neighborhood.
Despite all these setbacks, a group of resistance fighters are still trying to regain power. They soon learn that this is going to be harder than they first thought, because many people are loyal to the aliens and work so hard against the resistance group.This alien invasion film has an interesting start. Unfortunately the intro goes by at a fast pace, so you miss the real clarity surrounding the invasion. After this, the film turns into a cheap Sci-Fi invasion film with many cliché events and alien sounds that have occurred in other Sci-Fi films before. The pace also decreases after the start and the film is now more about the resistance fighters who plan what they can do against the aliens. People who have connections with the aliens keep an eye on the resistance fighters and always try to sabotage their plans.
If you do not pay attention, you will no longer be able to clearly identify who is on which side. These moments also make the film a bit more lengthy compared to how it started. For people who are familiar with Sci-Fi films, the events in the film can sometimes seem somewhat familiar or predictable.The effects also look unclear and cheap, because the aliens are hardly visible. When the aliens appear in the film, the scenes are poorly exposed. This is how the film comes across as Aliens vs. the film. Predator 2 - Requiem.
It seems as if the filmmakers have chosen this, so that the viewer cannot see again how bad and cheap the aliens actually look. There is actually only one real scenes where you can see aliens and this comes across as a cheap version of the Terminator.The acting is also not done so well. John Goodman seems to be the only one who still tries to do his best in the film. Of the other characters you only get to know their mutual relationships with each other, but otherwise there is not really anything of a development in their characters. Sometimes the characters also suddenly disappear from the film and only come back when they are needed to further the story.",Captive State

67,FallenEye,"Captive, but not Captivating.",5,24 October 2021,"Captive State starts off with the kind of bang that makes you feel that you're about to be in for quite the engaging and overtaking ride, but then, somewhat unexpectedly, that ride slows down dramatically while still in the beginning stages of the movie, and as it slows down, the pacing also gets affected, as well as the storytelling, until the movie just becomes almost incomprehensible.The ending is tainted by the journey towards it, because as this movie progresses, it somehow loses the viewer's attention, by feeling disjointed, having a lingering plot carried by an almost incoherent screenplay, with characters that don't feel necessary while those who do, are hard to understand why until you do, but by then, it kind of feels too late.Captive State is not exactly a terrible movie, especially given its ending, but what makes it not that great is that, it was well within reach for it to have been better, but it just couldn't do it. Around 70% of it's first act, almost all of its second act, and all of the 3rd act except the end, this movie fell completely flat, and just couldn't recover.5.4/10.",Captive State
68,digdog-785-717538,"Film, entertain us!",6,5 June 2019,"I understand that this film failed hard at the box office, and i can see why, however it is not without merit.The story is of a recent alien invasion by a semi-bening race of anthropomorphic insectoids, the ""Legislators"", who are all pissy because humans are unruly and dumb and so they implant every human with a live bug in their neck, and make them work and force them to be happy.There's a bunch of conspirators who do resent being happy, and decide to blow stuff up.John Goodman stars as the villain chief of police who tries to stop the terrorists.Now, the film is slow, and the choice (probably dictated by budget) to have unknown-to-me actors as the leads doesn't help, but the acting is reasonable, the plot is fairly complex, the realism is pretty high, the audio design is excellent, and possibly the most important aspect of the film.However as this is basically a high tension heist film, you'd want the typical heist film tropes, such as a charismatic lead; instead it looks like a product of british television, more adapt to a longer, serialized runtime than your 1 1/2h format of cinema. And there's precious little pewpews and kabooms you normally associate with sci-fi films.I dont really know if you could improve on the film, it is what it is, it sticks to its strong plot and demands attention from the viewer, but at times it becomes unexciting, maybe even a little boring.
John Goodman is surprisingly in form here, and it's just a shame that his role is peripheril to the main plot.Compare this to Children of Men, a film that had a great many issues, from the pacing, to the direction, the casting, even some plot choices were debatable, but the otherwise incredible photography and visuals coupled with awesome sound design more than make up for it, and you'd think Captive State could use some of that.it's not you, Captive State, it's us; we're dumb and we want to be entertained.

One where humans are allowed to live on Earth going about their business, yet are subjects of an alien force, and the humans essentially police themselves. Rupert Wyatt deserves a tip of the cap for being original, and being able to bring his creative story to life on relatively low budget.So many movies about aliens have them as the central focus or antagonist. This is certainly not the case. It actually parallels many stories in the real world. Rebellions always need to start somewhere, and they need to gain traction in order to generate momentum. That's what this film is about; it's that process. It can be a little slow or confusing, but it does all come together for a satisfying end.John Goodman is most definitely the life blood of the film.

Goodman was a solid performer, as usual, but not outstanding.The story meandered far too much. At one point, the movie almost turned into a heist/Oceans 11 style movie and I almost gave up at that point. Toward the end, the story started to pick up.The ending was reasonable. The story concept was excellent. The focus away from the aliens was a bonus as it would have only served to detract from the main story.By the end, I felt the movie had redeemed itself to earn a score above 5/10. It's definitely not on my priority list. However, for a movie that has some political correctness, it was quite tame. In Hollywood today, it's rare you see a move that's not pushing someone's ideology, so, that probably upped the score that the politics was kept to a minimum.",Captive State

89,rmarkd,It tried...,5,16 May 2020,"Captive State tells a, for me, tiresome story of a resistance group fighting back on vastly superior aliens.It starts off with aliens invading and quickly taking over the Earth. Humans have no choice by to accept their new masters and the aliens start taking our natural resources using us as labor.This particular story is set in a Chicago neighborhood and centers around Gabriel Drummond and his older brother Rafe, who a leader of the resistance, but was killed, but we find out later he wasn't because, plot twist. There's also a guy, Bill Mulligan, who is tasked with trying to eradicate the resistance cell in this community.Gabriel gets involved with the resistance and the movie spends a good third of it getting a message from one place to another using some convoluted scheme that's supposed to look smart. Strange how it's simultaneously so hard to communicate, yet there's this elaborate system of communicating established.Anyway, the goal is to place an alien explosive device (of course!) on an unsuspecting person meeting the aliens. The alien explosive device can't be detected by the aliens (of course!) although humans have no problem finding and using it.They put together their impossible mission force and successfully blow up the underground section of Soldier Field, taking some aliens with them. Unfortunately, they're quickly found, gathered, and mostly killed. Gabriel and Rafe are both captured. Mulligan gives Gabriel a chance to save his brother by exposing the resistance group.Gabriel does so and Mulligan and team quickly find ""Number One"" -- the leader of the group, who turns out to be a prostitute ""Jane Doe"" who bugged her room to record conversations with her Johns. One of the Johns turns out to be Commissioner Eugene Igoe, who is taped giving sensitive information. He's gone and Mulligan takes over given he found and neutralized the resistance cell.In the main ""twist"" of the movie, Mulligan turns out to be working for the resistance and Gabriel sees a video where Mulligan, other resistance members, including Jane Doe actually know one another. It ends with Mulligan going tot he alien ship with the plot convenience explosive device on him to deal a major blow to the aliens. The credits show other resistance groups fighting back.I had a few issues with this movie. 1) it seemed to go nowhere for too long of a time. 2) the ""twist"" (Mulligan was part of the resistance) was telegraphed so early on and was so obvious that it almost would have been more of a twist if the twist didn't happen. 3) The movie is dark and choppy, trying to be edgy, I suppose. 4) The movie tries to be smarter than it ultimately was. 5) the plot convenience explosive deviceThat said, John Goodman was great in playing Mulligan. The twist was still satisfying, even if obvious. I think if you chopped off about 30 minutes, it would have conveyed the same story without feeling so ""get on with it""-like. I liked it for what it tried to be, but it ultimately missed the target.",Captive State

They'd be invaded for, I think, 9 years already. You know they know all your whereabouts and have you under surveillance. That's what the implants are for. The Resistance plot was interesting.

102,umimelectric,Captive State of confusion,6,2 June 2019,"This science fiction drama makes a lot of assumptions- it forces the viewer to adapt to it, piece together the whats and whys, and assumes you'll keep up enough to enjoy it. I consider myself to be pretty good at deciphering dense story lines but there is a lot to learn here...and it's rewarding if you stay focused. The film begins at what seems to be the origins of an invasion, then immediately cuts to the main narrative which takes place 9 years later. What happened in those 9 years is explained with events as they unfold on screen, so the audience is treated as if they are already in the know, as someone who is really there and has lived through the drama, not someone watching a movie for the first time.
With that said, it's a cool movie, it just takes some flexibility and an open mind. The aliens are very original and frightening, which is refreshing.

Problem is, unlike Colony, this movie made me feel like I was dropped into ths middle of the story. Another review stated that understanding how the human/alien arrangement worked was unimportant, however i completely disagred. While we understand there are humans rebelling against the occupation, we have no concept of exactly what it is they are rebelling against. Although it features a well chosen cast, I felt the plot was old and stale and throwing in the occasional alien did nothing to change this.

But while a peace is made and seems to be working out well for the capitulators, in that the new America is a rollicking econmoic success with an astonishing employment rate, the resistance is not buying into this post-alien invasion version of America.

I mean, it's not great, but I've seen worse. Way worse.The story is basically The Man in the High Castle but with strange aliens rather than human invaders. So there's a secret band of insurgents working individually towards an opportunity to fight back.
Nothing new there.Character development also suffers because there are too many players and too little time.
This should have been a limited series at best, but to what end, since we've seen it all before and, as mentioned, we already have Philip K. Dick's inspired The Man in the High Castle, for those who are interested in the long game.Despite all that, I thought the actors did a decent job in their respective roles, and I'm really liking John Goodman's choice in movies this decade.However, I did not expect the final twist at the end à la a Trojan Horse.
That was either very clever or very dumb of me to not see it coming.Also, the fact that we, the audience, did not get a chance to even catch a glimpse of the so-called Closed Zone, was such a cop-out.

I read somewhere that this movie is like the sequel of a movie that don't exist and that really summed my experience. There's no character development here so you really don't care about neither of them, there's not a lot of context about this world and technologies and a lot of things that this movie shows. I see that this is more about rebellion and politics than about aliens which make them unnecessary to the story, the aliens could've been replaced by a dictatorship, feels like the only point of having aliens was to enlarge their audience. I'm not sure if there's a plot here because like I said there's not much character background story and context so this movie is about a rebellion agains aliens that fails, we spent time on this to see they organize a rebellion, fail and die and that's basically it, and then the lead investigator against them climb up on the chain of command.

Little to no context is offered as to how the invaders ingratiated themselves to those who are in power. There is a small amount, and I mean a tiny percentage of on screen interaction between the aliens and humans. The most interesting aspect of this film, is how it is essentially a metaphor for the social climate we are living in today. How oppressive, how dehumanizing, how cruel, we can be to other human beings. This is a major plot point and it's political agenda is not subtle.",Captive State
124,piggulu,Don't go in looking for another Independence Day,9,2 April 2019,"This is more of a spy thriller than the typical alien invasion action movies. There are no gung-ho military men or plucky average joe who saves the day by sheer willpower, no booming gunfights or flashy UFOs. Just a small group of people hoping to start something bigger. Things move slow and deliberately, with information mainly passed along through dialogue. If that's not appealing to you, then this won't be for you (though you'll be missing out).The majority of the film is spent on the younger brother of one of the rebels who had died leading a successful bombing years prior. While he tries to aid the group in planning a new attack and live up to his bro's name, John Goodman plays a hard-nosed alien loyalist detective trying to uncover the plot. The movie does a great job portraying how an underground terrorist network could work, using seemingly innocent symbols and gestures to communicate, to avoid the ever-watching eyes of the aliens drones and listening devices.I honestly don't see how many people found it convoluted or confusing, everything felt straightfoward to me (excluding the beginning of course when motives aren't completely established). The characters tell you what you need to know, and there is little that actually needs to be decrypted or interpreted. Most negative reviewers seem to be hung up on how intricate the plan was, but these aren't suicide bombers, and with the hi-tech surveillance around covert baby steps are key. There's also a lack of information on the aliens (what they want, how they function) which would've been nice to have but doesn't factor much to the goal of fighting back the occupation.",Captive State

Could be its not spoon fed storyline. I cannot understand the review that said its separate stories.... No, not really. It more tells the story from the perspective of a couple supporting characters, but they all are working in tandem so there wasn't a sense of any divided approach.Overall, very good. Wish the CGI had been featured better. I get it might not have been the highest quality but it still seemed like really cool ideas but was really hard to see most of it.Kind of like a touch of Predator, good dose of Arrival, and a splash of Armageddon with an overall War Of The World's/ Signs effect.

I won't repeat the points other positive reviews have made. But it's worth noting that if you liked the USA Network TV show ""Colony"" centered on the alien takeover of the planet, specifically Los Angeles, there's a 95% chance you'll get into this story fairly quickly.
That's not to say that ""Captive State"" is a ""Colony"" knock off. The TV show had weeks to build story, characters and post-invasion background. A two-hour movie doesn't have time for that kind of depth and relies on viewers paying extra-close attention to lots of little details, which can be jarring and confusing.
This movie is not a dumb, sci-fi shoot-out with the evil invaders: our tough guy/gal military and scrappy civilians outsmarting and outshooting aliens at every turn. As Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson speculated: ""If aliens are technically advanced enough to get here across the vastness of space, they're powerful enough to wipe us out if they want to.

Go look them up and you will see a pattern here, all their reviewed movies are 10s, all of them! In the real world, this movie is a 2 tops. The lead actor looks like a wannabe rapper who Hollywood thinks it is it's duty to make into a star for some reason like so many others. The dude is just a bad actor no other way to put it. You can't turn a Ricky Ricardo into a James Bond, it just doesn't work. Hollywood tries to pull it off anyway. This role in this movie doesn't work for this dude. The role needs to fit the actor and the actor needs to make the role fit the character. Neither happened here. John Goodman and Vera Farmiga should have stayed home, they didn't need to be in this and they just wasted a lot of my time. This flick qualifies as more Hollywood junk.",Captive State

It was total coincidence to watch it.And it did start slooooow .. soo slooow... But it became more and more engaging with a steady rise in tension and conclusion. By the end, i was totally blown away by it.AMAZING characters, great, great acting .. great storytelling.There is little real ""action"" - special effects are .. subtle. They are there when necessary, - but mostly absent. It felt like a very realistic take on aliens - hard to know who is who, who to root for and who to dislike really.I can fully recommend that movie - but urge you to stick to it.

So it's nice that it managed to also be gently interesting, because otherwise, you might not keep watching long enough to experience the true, bone calcium depleting boredom this movie gets up to. Holy cow.If I had to guess, the director was settled that getting a clear, contextual look at the bad guys would be a deal breaker, and also felt like that kind of blurry, just out of focus presentation needed to be earned, because the whole film feels shot to endorse the few times the aliens are nearly seen as credible. The whole film feels extremely intentional, which makes it being dreadful all the stranger - just as the bad guys are always just out of focus, so too is there a pervading sense that a payoff is *just* around the corner.And, honestly, there might have been, because I started jumping around looking for something interesting and just...never found anything.A puzzler, to be sure.",Captive State

After an alien invasion has taken over the world and rules it with an iron, though exceedingly strange, fist. It's a darn good movie. Filled with heroic, believable characters of every race, Americans all, citizens, who sacrifice to strike the match to light the explosion that may lead to liberty. Massive plot holes (don't pay too much attention to the plot!), characters come and go and are hard to keep track of, but John Goodman is great, the 'underground' believable, and the captive state much like Paris or Warsaw under the Nazis.",Captive State
133,patrick-91640,The second half beats the first one,7,16 May 2021,"The second half is where the movie begins to shine. It binds all the loose ends together and has a rather clever resolution/ending. With that ending many characters develop further and become more relatable.The first half on the other hand is clearly the weak spot of the movie. Too many characters, too fuzzy story telling and sometimes an even bad pacing. I was close to skipping this one after the first 30 minutes have passed. Glad I didn't.Besides that there are some major deficits. For example that we nearly see nothing of the alien forces or why they are so welcomed by the humans. In the eye of extinction I would have expected a lot more resistance. Besides that this is a tremendous waste of opportunity because the alien design seems to be decent enough and worth a closer look.All in all the second half and the ending carry the movie. At least if you don't except an action or dci fi movie. Captive state is none of that but a mostly clever character centered political thriller with an intense atmosphere.",Captive State

138,Safetylight,Colony meets The French Connection.,7,3 October 2020,"First off...We're spoiled! -As media consumers... If this film had come out thirty years ago, people would still be talking about it today, teaching it in college film classes. The visuals and set designs were extremely well produced, the actors believable, (Goodman's weary detective partner was only in a couple of scenes, but his performance was so much fun to watch).Sure, Captive State wasn't inventing anything new, (so maybe it wouldn't actually be taught in film history), but it knows all its metrics and uses them well. The production values were top notch, Chicago looked as bombed out and rutted with ruin as you could ever want for a post-war film set on modern American soil.And that's hard! Visuals which have insightful backstories but which are not spoon fed to the viewers? If the observant and interested viewer might ask, ""Whoa. What was that I just saw the camera breeze over back there?"", I suspect the set designers and prop masters would be able and possibly even eager to explain it fully.In the real world, every object, by virtue of simply existing in reality, makes sense in its presence. It has a series of causes and effects which served to place it there. -In a movie, however, the true reason an object appears on set is that the film crew put it there, (or chose not to hide it), and that means limited human minds were responsible for inventing a plausible narrative for its appearance. And humans aren't always very good at the job. -Which is particularly challenging for the sci-fi genre, whose viewership is often made up of obsessively knowledgeable and observant sorts.For instance.., there's one shot in a bunker, with a kid is sitting on top of a bank of filthy car batteries. Just a quick glimpse, only a one or two seconds on screen. -But they were not arbitrary set dressing; they were probably powering the bank of salvaged computers being used by the story's resident hacker. (Also only on screen for no more than ten seconds). But by this point in the film, after seeing the exquisite attention to detail, I was willing to bet that if the hacker bunker were a real place, then the number of batteries necessary to run the operation would be accurate to the amp hour. Somebody worked it all out. It wasn't just a mythological wall of blinking lights and dials like you see in some generic Bat Cave. The set pieces were probably only a short distance away from actual functionality. (I hope the team responsible for designing the sets reads this: Great Job!)Another of my favorite points:Much of the story was told through television news clips, and man, they did a bang-up job with those! The fog of background news chatter seemed very authentic, had the newscaster voices and visual patterning any ongoing network coverage of war and disaster might feel like today. -It was not the focus, but put there deliberately to have that exact effect of filling the void with history, all well observed and well accomplished! Again.., Great Work!However.., there were a couple of points in the story itself which I thought were a little too precisely thought out. -The execution of the elaborate underground bombing mission, without the allowance of any open coms, requiring the exactly timed actions of a half dozen rebel agents to not trip or miss their marks seemed a bit unlikely. -Like, when the calls for action came down, if just one participant had been taking a washroom break, or even just in the next room over, the whole operation would have stuttered.But I can excuse that. It was cool to see an underground rebellion operation work flawlessly even if the mechanism seemed a little wishful in their perfection. In the depressing, hope-deprived environment of their soot-covered world, it's hard to begrudge a little sunshine by way of excellent human agents. And who knows? I've never lived under the heel of an authoritarian alien oppressor government, so perhaps it's only human to rise to the challenge. I'm willing to be the creators of this film would put up a stiff argument for why their protagonists were operating well within expected human capacities. Maybe I'm just soft.Though.., at the ending, -and I mean the very ending, where the credits are rolling, the viewer is presented with a series of images which suggest how the story continues for the human race, and does so in positive, ""Yay! We won!"" kind of way. That seemed more than a little wishful to me, given what we had seen already and what we know historically regarding technologically superior colonizing forces. But in the realm of sci-fi, where cutting the red wire three seconds before the clock runs down, and where internet computer viruses reliably save the day, I'm not going to cast judgement on a little wanton hope at the end of this film. And anyway, it wasn't overt; most people would be filing out of the cinema at that point. Besides, who wants to watch a film where the bad guys win at the end?Otherwise, I was really quite pleased to have seen this film. I hadn't been expecting much, and was rewarded with a much smarter script than this sort of fare normally offers along with a beautifully designed and produced visual experience with lots to chew on for the curious observer.",Captive State

The biggest problem is that the movie jumps around between a number of small groups and individuals on both sides--both resistance fighters and collaborators plus a few assorted political and enforcement persons. In the end I got the gist of the story including a fairly nice twist at the end, but I have a little difficulty sorting out in retrospect, whether some of the minor players died or escaped or why they were there in the first place. If you follow most of the story I think you will appreciate it. If you miss some of the pivot points you'll end up lost and discouraged. By no means should you go to this movie expecting the story to unfold like a straight line action movie. Consider it more of a challenge or a test, than entertainment. The best venue for watching this movie is probably on DVD with a number of mystery loving friends where you can pause the action and ask questions. I give it a 7 out of 10 on first viewing. I might upgrade it after rewatching several times.",Captive State
153,ChipperX,"Light A Match, Start A War... Captive State (2019).",10,16 March 2019,"By Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Captive State is an alien occupation film like many you may have already seen: Greedy aliens come to earth wielding sophisticated technology, seeking to rob the earth of its natural resources. Similar movies are V (1984), Independence Day (1996) and Battlefield Earth (2000). Like those movies, humans resist the aliens to spectacular effect, creating heroes out of the common every-man. Unlike other alien blockbuster movies, this one comes to the screen with very little hype and an incredible ensemble cast.John Goodman's performance as William Mulligan is not to be missed, but the real star of this movie is Ashton Sanders as Gabriel Drummond. He is real and very believable, which propels this film forward into legendary status. Honorable mentions go to Jonathan Majors, Vera Farmiga, Kevin Dunn and Alan Ruck.Science Fiction movies tend to be either big on special effects, or big on character development: The best SciFi gives us equal measures of both. Captive State succeeds partially because it is hard to see where the movie is going until the moment has arrived. We are aware immediately that there is a resistance afoot, but the players are literally unknown to us. That is a huge burden for people who like their fiction predigested, but true fans of SciFi are patient. Audience attention is crucial in Captive, where all the moving parts are quickly shuffled. When the special effects are introduced, they are original and terrifying. When you begin to catch the arc of the characters individual motivations, then all the pieces begin to fall into place - and the pace of this movie is break-neck.The aliens are not 100% original - but they are close enough to be mistaken for something totally new. As a bonus, they are utterly terrifying. The techno-organic symbiosis employed by the alien race is not incredibly advanced, but it succeeds in scaring the audience and upping the threat-level exponentially. What the movie does best is give the alien race ten years in our atmosphere to completely supplant our political system, effectively becoming the highest form of government, called Legislators. The alien race plays on our corruption, fear and systems of power to become the dominant species on earth. They propagandize their actions by telling humans there is no more hunger, no more war, and no more unemployment - so long as the Legislators are permitted to remain in power.Captive State is a thinking man's science fiction movie that does not skimp on special effects, plot or set-pieces. By successfully intertwining suspense, drama and action, this movie succeeds where countless other alien occupation movies have failed. Overall score: 10/10.",Captive State

There were some really fantastic ideas in this movie that really got me thinking, and I honestly could not even explain to you what the faults were. It is a nearly great script with countless small problems. And the movie doesnt really explain itself. Granted I missed the opening, but everything that happened was rather vague, which I normally enjoy. But it became confusing. And some aspects were incredibly jarring and out of place, but I get what they were going for, the film is definitely a solid concept with great world building. I definjtely love the world this movie depicts. It is very scary and thought provoking.

156,criscrossin,Enthralling realistic sci-fi without much action and aliens,7,26 June 2019,"Unexpectedly enthralling for me. Eventhough there were lots of unexplained leads and short lead-ups in the begining.
The Aliens are seen in few scenes, they stay below the ground and control the humans by collaborating legislators. The city of chicago is almost under siege. The resistance network has been working through advertisements in the newspapers. They want to destroy the aliens through one broad stroke. We just don't know what it is. All throughout the movie we are progressing towards that one final apocalypse. The mystery lies in understanding that.
Gabriel is probably the main protagonist here , through whose eyes we start the movie and progress to some extent. Dark composition of the society. Everybody is oppressed. Some notes are passed over secretly and by birds, like in middle ages. The goal is to remain below the radar of the collaborators. Everybody is under observation. Some guys want to have a short burst of running away, they believe they can go beyond the purview of the aliens. But the saner ones are against that. They create a farrago of a scheme which even the close ones of the characters do not know.
A senior collaborating security detective is helping Gabriel, sometimes we find he tracks him to apparently foil his efforts too. That way he catches the elder brother of Gabriel , who is a sort of hero to the other young resistance leaders by being the first one to break away. He is still living and in the hierarchy of the fight back.
We are given lots of red herrings. Majority of the characters are seen as set-pieces , and the whole scene moves towards some grand scheme.
Finally there is a tremendous twist which may not be understood immediately or in one view.
The music is eerie. It creates an evironment of blue and grey alongwith the cinematography. There is tremendous emotional force in the people of the city to break out but hey are under tremendous pressure and controlled. The insectoid aliens are innovative.

I didn't know it was ""supposed to be"" an alien invasion movie. Instead I got an entertaining, weaving tale of intrigue and a seemingly non-existent protagonist. I enjoy when a movie takes me in a direction I wasn't expecting to go, as long as it keeps my interest.In Captive State we jump back and forth between characters, unsure of where the story is headed. It seems aptly symbolic of the real world detachment some insurgent cells purposefully have from one another. Each group knowing a piece of the plan, while few top leaders see the whole picture.The settings felt real and rich with detail. Details that didn't cost a lot in budget dollars but added tons of value to the screen. Captive State reminded me of 'Children of Men'. Both set in bleak, near-future worlds facing a threats to human survival. Both meander through groups of characters that are found and quickly forgotten. Kudos to this director who leaves certain scenes up to our imagination. Sometimes our imagination of what happens is more exciting than watching a director try and play it out step-by-step on screen.In the end, one of the highest praises I can give is that I've thought about this movie a lot since first viewing, and that's something not many movies coming out today can boast.",Captive State

161,TheSchinppenSchnaff,A thinking man's movie!,9,3 May 2020,"This is not a scifi action flick where we fight an alien invasion and win against all odds. This is a detective story. There is no distinct main character, just a lot of intertwined rolls, all of whom are morally ambiguous and take actions your would never expect.If a civilization can harness the energy to traverse the stars, it has the ability to destroy worlds. Comparing the pointy sticks and sharp rocks of the stone age to modern nuclear warheads fails to capture the disparity in power between our civilization and one capable of colonizing the galaxy by force. This movie never suggests that humanity could win a war against an alien overlord, but it states outright that we're better off going out with a fight than dying in a whisper.The villains of this story did not need to be aliens, any totalitarian regime could have easily worked, but I think the use of extraterrestrials was brilliant given the way in which the viewer can interpret the villain in anyway they need to suspend disbelief an enjoy the story. For example, I found it particularly striking when thousands of people gathered to praise their alien overlords for creating a world without war or crime, while creating record level employment and prosperity. You could interpret that single scene as an allusion to any variant of right-wing or left-wing extremist.Many will figure out the twist in the story quite early on in the movie - it's pretty obvious. But at the same time, all the characters keep on doing things you just would not expect, leaving you to constantly second-guess your analysis of the characters when anticipating the next scene.Acting was great.The cast was fantastic.The dialogue was believable.The setting was morose and imbued one with the despair and hopelessness.John Goodman was amazing. I have never seen him play such a subdued an inanimate roll. In the Runner, for example, his character, while being cold and calculating, still seethed with intensity.

Goodman's acting, along with a strong supporting cast, brings you into the movie and keeps you guessing. At one point you think you have figured it out and then a couple of minutes later you aren't so sure. The guessing game continues and while it's not the most climactic ending, it's a solid ending.
The story slows at some points but never enough to cause you to divert your attention to you dog licking his balls beside your recliner while you daydream about, ""What if?""
I enjoyed the movie and when you accept it for just being a good story that had a solid premise, even if it fully failed to achieve its potential, you enjoy it more.

Just a nice mid-range sci-fi movie, with both decent alien screen-presence and decent off screen presence. The music was great. It ramped up the tension nicely. Might be the best part of the movie.

168,fromTull,Chicagos never looked better!,5,31 January 2020,"Horrible. You are dumped in the middle of a story with a dry, emotionless young lead and John Goodman who is given nothing to work with. We know aliens have captured all of the major cities and that a insurrection is rising again after one failed attempt to rebel against their new overlords. The problems are many. The actors aren't engaging enough to carry the film because the characters they're portraying are D-U-L-L. The aliens are barely present (it's hard to hate something that's offscreen. . . that actually improved Chicago's crime rating). Worst of all, the film is one loooong march from room to room and location to location. Constantly following fast walking people through various doors. Staring at the backs of countless strangers as they walk you into vague and nondescript situations. By the time you orient yourself, it's time for a new setting with new characters you'll see for five minutes. The faces change so frequently that they cease to matter (except for the DRY leads). I guess the director thinks this persistent movement is supposed to be exciting, but it's not. The music is sparse but persistent and monotonous. It made me want to seize. The flick doesn't show enough emotion to humanize it, and it's not alien enough to make it exciting. Stuck in the boring space between.",Captive State

So where does it go off the rails, apparently right off the dolly rails, right from the beginning. Blair witch wasn't so scary people left the theatres puking, they were suffering from motion sickness. Today's kitschy action camera move is to forget about any rigging and just run with it. In fact it sometimes looked like the editing suite added some jittery rhythmic plug ins of their own. That this cheap trick is already trite and tired is enough that it's starting to fade from popularity. The hold outs use it for only the most dire sequences and typically only in lazy B and even C action movies. It was used with moderation in No Country for Old Men, Sicario liked it, heck even Spielberg has tried it out, but none of them from opening to closing credits. This movie had potential. The creatures are new to me but looked born of anime origins, unfortunately we see their armour skinned versions in first few minutes and have their urchin shells peeled back to reveal the dying bogeyman soon after. Tada!, now what to do for the next one hundred minutes. The plot echoes some of the real world news cycles, the nation divided ripe with alterior motives or greed, if you dug a bit it felt like the story they were trying to tell. That good wins out over evil eventually. Unfortunately the character development is weak and disjointed. There are frial bones of some decent storytelling in the body of the script but it never presents itself well enough for you to attach to the characters. The 'weapons' or powers used to off the humans is interesting but it's been done before too. Check out War of the Worlds, circa Cruise. I expected some Cloverfield camera movements having seen the trailers and planned ahead taking a gravol, I should have taken the nighttime version and simply slept thru this one, would have been better use of my two hours. I like to find at least some positives in a film, films are the culmination of many people's efforts, this is one film that I can't find one except maybe some trademark canned expressions we all enjoy from John and Vera, Ferris Buellers Alan Ruck is a surprise, Ashton Sanders, Transformers Dad Kevin Dunn and a less comical than usual character played by Kevin J O'Connor.

I (as per usual during rubbish movies) fell asleep during it, multiple times. I thought maybe this contributed to the fact that the film felt confused and disjointed but my wife said she remained awake and I hadn't missed anything worth seeing.
John Goodman walks around looking really cross about something, maybe at his flagging career. There is a hilarious scene in it thanks to him though where he's walking about in a balaclava, I'm not sure why because he takes it off anyway, revealing the same facial expression he's had throughout the movie, we were in tears watching that scene. Go back to the comedy John you're good at it!!
Vera Farmiga's in it. Yeah.. Losing faith in our Vera. She was amazing in Bate's motel but she's done a couple humdinger movies of late..
So don't be expecting an alien action movie out of this one, it's not anything like that.

The Nazis in many cold war thrillers are more terrifying. Especially in Marathon Man which I felt this film bared some resblance.

Think about it, only the Commissioner can descend deep down where the aliens live, within the closed zone.... no one else.John Woodman's role, as usual, is fantastic and it makes a whole difference in the movie.

I won't relate the plot as it's already well written about.
The first half was probably a bit slow for some , but it was probably necessary to set up the story.
Overall the movie looked good on the eye it can't be easy to invent a new look for aliens these days, they did remind me somewhat of the aliens in 'attack the block' The special effects/aliens were used sparingly, which was a positive thing. The feeling of hopelessness and despair was palpable.
The plot was interesting without being overly complicated. For me the most interesting and sinister aspect was that the alien 'legislators' lived deep underground.
There is a twist in the tale that you can probably see coming. Personally I think this is in the tradition of good sci fi.",Captive State

Sci-fi plots usually have lots of flaws but this one was pretty tight, I didn't find any glaring errors that pulled me out of the experience.From a philosophical viewpoint the real strength of this film is the parallels it draws from real life oppression by powers today. The aliens have superior technology used to oppress the humans, much the same way real life superpowers oppress developing countries around the world.The parallels are so striking and in such a novel way that while I was already sympathetic to the plights of the oppressed, I felt I had a better understanding of what it must be like under the thumb of the powerful, with a bleak future ahead.",Captive State

Boy was I in for a surprise. The story is expecting you from the beginning to understand that you need to pay attention and if you do just that you'll get immersed in no time. And believe me it's not difficult.
Good action movies have that tension that keep you on the edge of your seat.
This film did not needed ""standard"" action to give you precisely the same kind of tension you expect in awesome action movies. The story is told in a very believable way. You know that there are aliens ruling us, but you do not have to see them to make you believe that they are ruling human lives. I was never distracted from a story line that did not make sense or actors not performing believable characters. The visuals are aesthetically gritty and setting the mood that fits the story best.
Cons
There is not really a but, but maybe I've seen to many movies with twists to be able to predict. Normally I would be annoyed by knowing it, but in this story it was kind of satisfying.I love stories of invasion and resistance and the action and heroics that come with it, but a movie like this grounds me to reality and makes me not forget that we as humans will have to depend on our intellect to fight against a power greater than ours and that will be not easy nor will it be done fearlessly.I give it an 8.",Captive State

There is some of each, but it isn't the point and in my opinion this is better for it. A lot of times low budget movies depend too much on cheap theatrics and fail to capture the charm they could have had. This one doesn't make that mistake.

We do see first hand what their rule has done: create a sharply divided society where the ""haves"" who work with the aliens to rule live in relative luxury compared to the squalor in which the rest of the population is concentrated.As is usual in such films an underground ""insurgency"" has evolved to oppose rule by the extraterrestrials. We follow a police officer (played by John Goodman) as he attempts to snuff out the insurgency. Domestic electronics have for the most part been outlawed and he has monitoring tools not normally available to regular citizens.On the other hand the insurgency has evolved a mix of traditional and old fashioned means (would you believe carrier pigeons and classified newspaper ads?) to communicate their plans.Much of the movie is a cat and mouse game between the police and the insurgents as we follow multiple characters in a plot that initially appears chaotic and disjointed. But things are not as they seem. What we end up with is a very tense series of chases and surprises as we move to an unexpected climax.Some critics have complained about too many characters and a plot that would be more appropriate to a mini-series, but I disagree. It's a pleasure to see a solidly acted movie that focuses on desperate people not on overbearing special effects. This is what happens after the aliens take over and employ the ""locals"" to help enforce their authoritarianism.

I'm very shocked some reviewers gave it a 1 calling it crap. I've seen terrible movies and this isn't one. Great Cine photography, storyline, acting. This movie requires your full attention. There are a lot of moving parts and you have to be patient till the end for it to come together.The basic premise is that aliens have come to earth and took over, lots of casualities. Humans agreed to an armistice to avoid annihilation, and the aliens became our legislators ruling earth from a compound below ground and making the rare appearance. Flash ahead 9 years the aliens are exploiting our national resources and what we see is the domino effect of an insurgent group working to ""light a match, start a war.""I was able to correctly piece everything together during the last 20 minutes. If you're patient and invested in the story .. you should be able to do the same.This is definitely a thinking man's sci-fi movie- it you like thought provoking movies you'll enjoy this too.",Captive State

This is telling the story of people fighting against oppression. The context is just a marketing excuse to make you more attracted. But this story applies to what we have already seen in the past century. It's basically a modernized sci-fi-ed version of a great rebellion some of our grandfathers' took part to.
Just don't watch it waiting for the monsters and the aliens with super hi-tech in independence-day style fights.

This script might feel disjointed to some, and threatening to others, but for the intended audience, every word in the script is an quiet nod of affirmation from across the room.Finally, a sci-fi movie made for the people, not for the critic class.

219,The_Dog_Father,Surprising Very Good. 7.7,7,23 June 2019,"As other have stated, if you watched Colony (tv series), you would get this movie immediately. This movie was very close for me to give it 8 stars or equivalent or on a test a ""B.""I was very surprised how well this movie unfolded, and it didn't stack up to social, PC, political, or make everybody happy on the left. Often times, scifi series goes into sub plots of various ""themes"" about characters, and social agendas, which loses the story line, and then becomes lost in the PC appeasement, or worse, every diverse character gets the protagonist trophy.The trailer would leave you to believe there is some ""social"" justice themes going on, but that is just how Hollywood and the media forces everything on society now, and people come to expect it. It's also why most movies are so awful, nobody wants to go to the theater. It starts out with the kid asking for his lawyer. Hollywood needs to stop with the social justice crap.People see the trailer and think they are going to see something else.
The story line unfolds and keeps you interested, and is realistic and seems more credible. Characters are not complicated, and nobody is crying ""you don't know what's like to be me,"" or contrived racial hatred. No reflection or bashing on the current administration, it is a relief to not see those themes thrown into a movie. It also allows the story to be told without other motives or objectives.There is no back story, but it's clear what is going on. Maybe a younger audience wants to see alien vs human battles, or how other movies unfold. If you want see a good alien war movie, watch ""Battle For Los Angeles."" Critics tore it up, and my guess it is because the Military was not made to look awful for once, and got to be the were the good guys fighting to save civilians. I thought it was a good movie.This is not a romance, or social justice movie. It's not a an action shoot-em up or slathered in cgi for the sake of making special effects for story line fillers.One of the things I really enjoyed was that it is not some ""Bird Box"" style of movie, or some other scifi make you scared with annoying characters that young teens would appreciate more.A few comments and critiques that kept it from being an 8.
1. Cover picture for movie is terrible, but not enough to score down.
2. Interracial relationships or scenes are overplayed out and forced in a movie like this. Stop trying to appease and force it. No romance was even required for a movie like this. Absence of romance or love, shows the seriousness of the occupation, being oppressed, and state of mind of the humans.
3. The white kid acting like a eminem or the wanna be ""Yo"" rapper, was over played, and stereo typified, making him look like an idiot. Just make the kid normal like the main character, and stop up selling the whole making the diverse characters appear more acceptable.
4. Enough with the gay/trans being forced in every movie. Society gets it, everybody knows and understands, nobody is discriminated and no body cares your orientation. The scene that reflected that didn't kill the movie, because the next scene was an intense build up, but none the less, it just ""had to be there"" for some reason.Some of those issues are what kills most movies, but it appears Hollywood has a check list now when making a movie. Please Hollywood, just make good movies, we don't care who or what people are, just as long as the movie is good, and there is no PC pandering.It's not often I find good movies that are worth rating, this was a good movie, and despite a few minor critiques which usually kills most movies, this is very worthy of seeing and rating!Nice Job crew who made this movie;, I am an honest reviewer, firm, and consistent, and when a movie does a good job, you bet I give them all the credit they deserve.

227,srpnt,Gritty Spy-Syfi Alen Occupation Film,10,1 June 2019,"This is a gritty film that doesn't spoon feed the audience.
The film doesn't overly rely on CGI to tell the story. Instead it uses actors, action and mystery which are all held tense by the treat of discovery by the alien occupying force.
The script doesn't try to explain every detail with mythical science. Instead it sets the world and lets the actors and visuals unfurl the story organically. It does that really well, without leaving the audience confused if paying attention - so not a good film to scroll on your phone.
That shouldn't be a problem because the acting is outstanding. The director did a great job to get these great performances that all flow well. The cinematography is reminiscent of spy films, which is fitting for the mood of the piece.All up, this film is really well made.

I don't get it. Are people really that dumb? Clear as day to me. A resistance plot within a plot within a plot, etc. Humans were more than willing to sacrifice themselves and collaborate in unusual ways foreseeing the futile situation they were in.OK, there were aspects to this movie that weren't well executed. The ""hunters"" felt like an afterthought. The existence of the hunters and relationship to the roaches went largely unexplained . Hated to see Vera Farmiga's character die so suddenly after not too much involvement in the story. D.B. Sweeney is an excellent character actor and only made a cameo (felt he could have had a major role), and WTF was up with the unexplained enormous automatons on the pier of the lake we see in several shots of the lake and spaceship. One could say all these things made the whole production more mysterious to an extent. May be an opening to a sequel.I give this movie credit. It has a certain edge.

It's like leftist Hollywood wants to try brainwash the naive through their undertones and messages through these new films . Clearly this was aimed at a particular demographic and the dialogue and events definitely are delivered for that certain demographic . The film itself has a good pace and visual execution but is constantly lost in the overbearing PC nonsense . John Goodman is always spectacular and shows he still a great actor and the visual effects are pretty well put together . Overall it's definitely a solid film to watch but the dialogue and the message is so cliché and unnecessary at this point and bogged the movie down incredibly .

And this attempt isn't bad.We can say that a lot of signifiers are stupid, but if that gives us a sense of purpose of life, which means this signifier is useful and timeless, maybe this signifier is smarter than us and we need to experience more to have a deeper understanding.

There were some really cool ideas but the movie managed to suck all the entertainment out of them. Every time you think something cool is going to happen, the scene would cut and then another, boring scene would start. It was really frustrating being deprived of the satisfaction of seeing a cool scene. I would give this movie a lower score because it was probably one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen. A good sci-fi film immerses you a new universe, but this movie just gave you incoherent glances at that universe.

Admittedly, there are a lot of excellent sci-fi films that have a similar tone (see Blade Runner). However, those movies also had strong character beats and great performances.Meanwhile, this film can't even decide who the main characters are. The film begins by following John Goodman and Ashton Sanders' respective characters. There is a ten minute long sequence introducing a mostly new cast of characters over a half hour into the film.

That was the trade off Wyatt made for this movie. You see there is a very tin like between Creativity and Entertaining. Directors try to find the perfect gradient between these two entities. Something of high creative value is usually, if not at all, of very little entertainment value. This film like most films, failed to calculate that gradient just right. ARRIVAL is one of those movies which does this effectively. But CAPTIVE STATE aimed far too high. Most of the people who got online were trying to find a reason for their unapologetic hatred for the movie because a lot of expectations were on the line. Even I couldn't wait for the release.Wyatt and his team were aiming for a clearly mysterious and highly intense suspension. But this was poorly achieved as viewers couldn't really establish a sense of characterization with the few seconds of screen time they got. The dialogue is extremely weak (over done and under done). The reasons behind each characters actions is questionable. Viewers didn't get the chance to fully understand why some characters did what they did. The judgment is just psychological imbalanced and viewers know this because we're able to make reasonable judgements ourselves in our daily lives which is an ambitious attempt of what we wish to see on screen as a reflection of true human experience under an alien legislation. But yet that was a total let down as characters did the wrong things in the pretext of a final plot. The twist turned out to be better than the plot even though we didn't even getting the opportunity to comprehend 'why' certain points to the lead up to the twist.Nonetheless my main enjoyment to this was the sound effects. It was truly impeccable to me, as well as the fear built up by the aliens without actually seeing them too often. It keeps the movie in a 'Captive state' indeed, which is the whole point of it.Rating this a 5/10 is only a mere congratulations to the production team for, well, doing their jobs and the subtle creative idea behind the movie.

Captive State felt like a bunch of strung together and awkwardly cohesive puzzle pieces that overall fail to keep or cause, really, any interest. I get that you get what you put into anything, but this film offered very little help, to the point that even when the pace started to pick up after an hour... I didn't care. That's because, like this review so far, the film offered not much more than a superficial glimpse into anything: who the characters were, what drove any of them, what drove the beautifully (graphically) rendered aliens that made a couple appearances.

However, the movie itself delivered in spades.Standard space-invader tropes are cut exceptionally brief. You _have_ to pay attention (put that phone away). Clues, backstory, character is presented discretely, through props, ambient sound and acting. This is more thriller than action-opera, more art house noir than Hollywood 101.

The filmography is good enough to get your attention, the story, although sometimes gets predictable, has its twists and turns.

It is in this decision where the film gains strength. But let's be clear, Captive State is not a perfect movie, far from it. But it is an extremely imaginative film, with such intriguing concepts as revolution and aliens. It is a master class that explains how a revolutionary cell operates in a fictitious situation and gives us a thriller that makes us tense at times and intrigues us in others.

297,nicholass109,Just another film misrepresented by its own trailer.,3,22 March 2019,"For the past few months, I've been getting bombarded with trailers for this film. Making it seem like a sci-fi action thriller with really interesting characters plotting a way to survive an alien invasion. What it's really about, is Chicago surviving alien occupation, if you came for epic battles or even more than 3 or four scenes of action, you'll be sorely disappointed.The film starts out as a shakey-cam action movie, showing a car desperately trying to escape a cordoned off Chicago. This is where I felt most mislead, you're following this family around as they're running from cops, breaking through roadblocks and you're aching to find out why, obviously you know this movie has something to do with aliens, and you're hoping it's not another cloverfield or other cheap alien movie where you never see who the hell the enemy is, and then you're greeted by one of the creepiest aliens ever conceived by a concept artist. Relief instantly comes over you as you realize you're not going to sit for 2 hours just to see stock footage of public disasters and a giant alien leg and you think ""ok this can't be that bad if I've already seen some aliens"". Then the worst happens. A flash forward, nearly 10 years later you're in dystopian Chicago, waiting nearly an hour to see some kind of action. The entire movie is about a resistance cell planning to rid the city of the aliens once and for all. But the individual scenes don't really connect that well, one moment you're watching John Goodman drive through the Chicago streets like he's the newest member to the fast and the furious cast, then you're watching him get felt up by some woman and you can't even understand why, then you're watching the protaganist wander from place to place seemingly aimlessly, then you're watching a heist-film-like planning operation take place, then BOOM explosions-gunfire yada yada yada. More melodrama. Aliens land. Catch the resistance scum, generic torture scene, protaganist helps the bad guy to save his friend, bla bla bla, main bad guy was just a double agent the whole time, epic explosions (off screen) and the credits roll as you watch a Tom Clancy map of the world being taken over again by humans. Yay earth. What a waste of time. If you're like me and you don't like waiting two hours to find out what you're watching, then don't waste your time on this film.

303,ThePlagueLegion,"This is NOT an action movie, and that's a good thing.",6,15 March 2019,"Written and Directed by Rupert Wyatt, CAPTIVE STATE follows several characters and multiple perspectives in a Chicago neighborhood in a world completely operated by an extraterrestrial force known as 'The Legislators'. The film portrays numerous aspects of this alien occupation, and chronicles the both sides of a brewing conflict between the human race and the aliens.This is an extremely unique and likely very polarizing movie. Rather than a blockbuster-actioner laden with huge visual effects, CAPTIVE STATE is a somber look at 9 years after the major war has already occurred. What would usually be our primary focus is the framework of the story, which instead is much more of a political-espionage thriller with sci-fi elements. This automatically may be a turn off for some, but I found myself consistently intrigued and excited by the events that play out in the story. Aliens appear throughout the film but only in glimpses and from a far, usually. However, when we do see them up close, the effects work is actually quite impressive for a film made on $25 million. Not all the CG work is great but for the most part, much of it is very seamless and realistic in appearance. The creature design is also very well-done. The Legislators are extremely intimidating antagonists that, despite rarely seeing them in full, maintain a presence over the entire film. Some characters refer to the beings as 'Roaches', due to their insectoid behaviors and language, which consists of strange clicks, gurgles and buzzing. The sound design for these aliens is particularly effective, with many sequences upping the suspense due simply to the offscreen sounds of The Roaches, especially during a key scene toward the third act. The film succeeds in making us very intimidated of The Roaches, despite their infrequent appearances.It's unfortunate that Captive State has a very unfocused structure. Scenes jump from character to character, with the closest thing resembling a lead being John Goodman's character Bill Mulligan. We never really manage to feel invested in every one of these characters, and instead can only attach to a few. Goodman easily has the best part, with his ambiguous morals and stern demeanor keeping him a very believable, restrained character that steals most of his scenes. Ashton Sanders is very good as another sorta-lead, Gabriel, and several character actors (Alan Ruck, James Ransone, Kevin Dunn) turn in very layered, realistic performances. It's the performances, really, that come through in the end and make us care. Director Wyatt seems much more interested in focusing on the event and entire system of society under alien oppression, rather than the lives and details of each and every one of his characters. In some ways, this is a detriment, as it makes some payoffs feel very numb and sorta empty. But in other ways (which I will not spoil), the restraint on developing the characters pays off completely, as we manage to attach ourselves to them based solely on subtle performances and small character ticks that recur throughout the film. Some dialogue is admittedly clunky, and again, some emotional weight is removed with some of these character's fates when we hardly know some of their names. However, Rupert Wyatt clearly respects his audience, using visuals and limited information a create a very gloomy, suspenseful atmosphere that consistently kept me on edge. The lack of detail on the alien species and their capabilities puts us in the same position as the human characters -- in the dark, scrambling to make it in this ruthless setting.This, as well as the numerous other pros and a hefty load of solid social commentary, are enough to redeem CAPTIVE STATE of it's scripting faults and jumbled structure. An enthusiastic 7/10.",Captive State

307,davidgouldthorpe,Some Creative Elements But a Mostly Boring Slog,4,15 March 2019,"The movie starts interestingly enough, and the premise is really clever. But the rest of the movie just doesn't carry it. It talks about important events instead of actually letting us see them. It tells us that this and that person have an important deep bond, but we don't get any chemistry. The biggest developments in the plot only happen off-screen.Directing just flat-out didn't work. The acting felt too muted, especially in scenes that called for more emotion, while the camera work made it so difficult to see what was on the screen.I do have to say that there was a lot of clever writing with how the resistance pieces together their plan, and the espionage was mildly intriguing. But when new characters get brought in every few minutes, it's hard to really invest yourself in anything going on when you hardly know anyone.Finally, a question I've already seen asked around: why aliens? This movie would be virtually identical if this was Nazi-occupied America, or a newly minted megacorporate state. There's hardly any science-fiction present in the movie. It's 2028, and alien contact occurred nine years ago. Police and special ops haven't received any upgrades to their equipment to keep the order? There's nothing to suggest that aliens inhabit this universe except for the fact we're reminded every ten minutes or so.I had been really anticipating this movie, but I ultimately came away disappointed.",Captive State

326,ostrovskydanielbackup,A rare movie,8,24 August 2019,"Personally, I am glad such movies are made. ""Rare"" doesn't always mean ""good"" but in this case it does. That said, it certainly is far from entertaining and hardly suitable for some light-hearted Saturday night family past-time. Also, don't expect a sci-fi action - it's a (political) thriller and the alien invasion here could be replaced with any dictatorship. It is not fully clear whether the film-makers chose aliens for dramatic effect or just to make it easier for the audience to decide who the bad guys are. Sadly, history proved that not all freedom fighters make their country a better place.
As for the story, acting, cinematography - everything works well together to create the atmosphere of oppression, hopelessness and despair. There have been complaints that the script is messy. Well, it is not. If you accept the fact that there is no main character, no hero, no saviour, no deus ex machina and just watch closely, you are in for a decent detective story as well where each scene has a purpose and makes sense (honestly, I was able to predict the final ""twist"" something like 30% into the movie and still enjoyed sitting it through).
All in all, Captive State is bound to be misunderstood by those who want to unwind and is a rare gem for those who are open to a dark and thought-provoking story and are fed up with superhero extravaganza",Captive State

This is an occupation movie pitting collaborators against the resistance, with the aliens as the back drop. This movie is very similar to the TV series Colony (3 seasons on USA Network), following the resistance as they try to navigate around a militaristic state and plot their insurgency. The acting is top rate with many familiar faces (where have you been D.B. Sweeney!), with the exception of the lead Ashton Sanders, who barely carries the first part of the film, then disappears for a significant time during the middle.

There are references to certain ""zones"" which have been demolished by the new visitors, one of which is central to the films landscape of Chicago (chiraq for those paying attention to the news) which are proving to be less cooperative than the remaining remarkable cities of the world.Honestly the whole plot was transparent before the first (kind of lacking) action scene even teed off If anyone cant figure out that Goodman is the ""#1"" before the 1:05 mark then they deserve to love this one.The acting was great, the special effects and cgi were on point...there is a bit left wanting with the dialogue and storytelling but overall this one is worth a watch....... even if it does have sleeper cells finger prints all over it",Captive State

337,aaronerb,Decent resist-the-aliens movie,7,23 June 2019,"This was pretty good! If you're a long time sci fi fan, you'll still have socks on by the end but you'll enjoy it.As another reviewer noted this isn't quite a knock off of the tv show ""Colony"" but the basic premise is pretty darn close. We follow a young man who wants to fight back against an alien invasion force years into the occupation. We are also introduced to a mature resistance movement seeking to make a play. The depiction of the resistance organisation was well thought out, to my mind.Most of the negative reviews seem to revolve around the ""lack of plot"" or ""complex story"". While it's all linear time wise, there are a few different character-groups / subplots that get sustained camera time without a lot of cross over until later in the film. I found this a little disjointed, it didn't work entirely, but allow the thing to bring the plots together and its quite coherent. If you have watched a few world war II espionage movies, this will be completely straight forward. It's not a Marvel movie - good guys! bad guys! biff baff! good guys win! the end!As for the aliens being original (some other reviewers thought so)... maybe if you're young or new to sci fi. They're not exactly out there. Actually not so far off the aliens from the Brit alien invasion caper Attack the Block, just a bit pricklier.The film is darkly themed and intensely paced and scored at times, though by no means an action movie overall. Not one for the kids. It includes one scene with a bloodied character and the clear implication of a torture/beating. In another scene, a human is on the receiving end of an alien weapon - we're not close up and it's not exactly gory but it is bloody. There is also a surgery scene that is not as bad as one's imagination thinks it's going to be (I'm not too tolerant of gore) but certainly close up and would be disturbing for the sensitive.I'm giving this a 7/10 for a sci fi. This isn't a deeply thoughtful portrayal of the human condition or what have you. Just solid entertainment and well shot and acted.",Captive State

As for paid film critics - they are the bane of the film industry and in the same bag as film school teachers who have never made a film. They suck. Anyway enough of that. This film is very very good. Forget the district 9 comparison, this is more an aftermath of war of the worlds. The aliens are very well done and not too much of them are shown. The storys is complex and cast is perfect. And as for the twist - well you won't see it coming. My only criticism is the usual criticism for filmakers that think not actually showing the ending is a cool way of ending a movie. It's not. It shows you either ran out of ideas or money. In this case I can't imagine it was either so WHY NOT SHOW ALIENS AND THE ALIEN UNDERGROUND BASE AT END. Anyways caps off now. Ending aside it's a great movie.",Captive State

350,xxurenegadexx,A thought provoking thriller that takes time to develop,9,6 June 2019,"This movie providing an interesting take on the alien invasion genre - one that I'd never seen before personally. I don't normally right reviews, with this being my second ever, but I took the time to write this one because too many people were giving this movie unwarranted flack.First and foremost, this movie is not for anyone without the patience to try and think through every possibility. This movie takes time to develop and I found it particularly confusing initially as well, but that is expected with the initial time-skip. I have seen in many reviews that the ending is predictable but that, however, is subjective. In this movie, the viewer is exposed to numerous character arcs that intertwine and ways that can be completely unexpected. The viewer is equipped with more and more information as the story progresses - all the while parsing the information given previously. This progression can be seen as helpful or a waste of time if you aren't the sort of person to try and piece together a story - as you start from pretty much nothing at all. The director presents scenarios that would make the viewer question the decisions of the characters and later reconsider. The director provides an exposition dump that unravels the metaphor for greater interpretation while leaving previous questions open ended. The primary being about: whether or not the individual would have made the correct decision, whether the character made the correct decision, what were the possible implications of either, what the ending tells of the overall story, and more importantly the importance of the ending and the role every character played.This movie is very much about unpacking information and piecing together a puzzle of a story with less action than most people would expect.

I had no idea what was going on for the first 90 minutes. Characters just showed up with no explanation and were not seen again. Even more bizarre was that Vera Farmiga and John Goodman were in it. Sad to see this wind up on their filmographies. The theatre screwed up on their movie times and my son and I would have had to wait an hour for the next showing of Captain Marvel. (We live in a rural town and have to drive half an hour to the theatre.) The manager only charged us for one matinee ticket and I still felt like trying to get my $6 back.

It's like when a TV-show is cancelled with a massive cliffhanger because there's not enough viewers. When making a movie, you have 90-120 +/- minutes to make a brilliant movie, but instead of creating the brilliant ending we all are waiting for, Wyatt gives us a messy ending.I'm not going much into the movie itself, besides being promising.I can't stand ending like this. I know that someone love to make their own mind about an ending, but If I would so, I would get to my bed, close my eyes and picture the perfect movie. But I don't do that. I watch a movie to be entertained. I was until the end, which ruined up the entire movie. And that is way I will give it only one star. I don't care about the acting. I don't care about the effects. I don't care. Because this movie was a waste of money. It was a waste of time - for everyone!To make up for everything - make a Captive State 2 which explains more.
There is now way humans would be satisfied with aliens taking over the earth - at least not with the condition like in Captive State. We all want happy ending, but sometimes, happy ending isn't always the best ending. But an ending is always, always best!So, shame on you Wyatt!",Captive State

Probably character wise, the protagonist, if there was one, is not in this movie, looks like there's a sequel or draw your own conclusion.

In a genre where it is too easy to rely on CGI and frightful creatures and sequences to carry you through the movie, this one actually allows the story to do its job and be the heart of the film. A refreshing thing to see for an alien sci-fi. Grade A acting from the entire cast, good use of foreshadow and symbols, and occasional cinematic shots that were grungy and beautiful. This isn't another attempt to be the next Independence Day or War of the Worlds, nor does it try to be. And, more importantly, it doesn't need to be. Captive States stands strong, with a unique presentation that commands the viewer's immediate attention and commitment, making it not just another mind numbing, dystopian action flick.

No balance of high and low tension, it's always high which loses its momentum and effect after the first half-hour (which is right around the time that I got a minor headache)to recap:

It captured the whole 'who is watching?' paranoia very well.If you want to see aliens versus plucky humans in an action packed battle for survival, this is not the film for you.If you do want a slow burn, thought provoking film that does not attempt to spoonfeed us with obvious characterizations of the main players, this could well be it. It was for me.The main characters, for the most part we are told almost nothing of who they are, what motivates them, their hopes, their dreams. At the end of the film it becomes clear why we appear to missing what would be normally be considered to be essential character development. The characters themselves cannot afford to let the authorities see into their lives too much, so why should we be able to do so. Giving us too much early on would give the game away.For me the title 'Captive State' has more than one meaning. The walled off cities where the people are held captive, and also the aliens who allow themselves to become captivated by the one part of our hero's master plan that he wants them to see.Pay attention right to the end credits and one shall be rewarded with a very satisfying ending.",Captive State

I see a lot of reviews for it that suggest its rather mediocre, but its really quite an original concept. Alien invasion is nothing new, but the idea of humans being totally complicit with the aliens is interesting. Add to this the total surveillance of nearly everyone. The aliens and their human helpers (police, intel services, etc) can electronically track anyone with implanted chips.The way that John Goodman's character is secretly working with the resistance while appearing to be a total turncoat against humanity is quite brilliantly done. The musical score is intense and effective throughout. And the scene at the end when Mulligan (played by Goodman) goes into the decent chamber is wonderfully creepy and compelling. The audio portion of that sequence is an actual recording of a space launch to the moon, which kind of suggests that this is the start of a massive effort to overtake the alien captors.There are some pointless scenes, like some alien attack sequences that just seem to be fluff.

379,thedungbeetle,The music and FX helped but fell short with plot,5,28 June 2019,"Good FX and the music helped with the tension. The story however, was like watching the second sequel of a trilogy. There were hints about episode 1 and hints what episode 3 would be but wasnt a good start plot-wise. This could've been a great multi series movie but the producers unfortunately failed this one.",Captive State
380,peter-mjr,Dumb,2,8 August 2019,"If you are gonna make a 2 hour movie, just to fuck up the ending the dumbest way possible, better at least change the plot to reflect that and not spit fake hopes of at least one quality scene on a movie with otherwise good idea. The biggest mistake when making an alien movie in my opinion is to include them for a fracture of a second in scenes you know you should put them, but budged didn't allow that. Then change the plot, and call it ""mild sci-fi"". Actually the biggest mistake is to show aliens in a pitch dark scene and color them black. That's maybe more dumb than the first.",Captive State

383,yki-pantteri,Quite decent movie which makes you think deeper,7,29 May 2021,"Overall this movie reflects alternate future reality well. Who knows what will happen in 20 years or so? This is kind of happening allready in the globe, althought we are the aliens to each other. This movie contains one of the most memorable and intence scene at the end. John Goodman is fantastic and the music, the whole sound athmosphere makes it absolutely great. I will warch this scene many times in the future.",Captive State

386,apr_6,Slowly gets better,6,30 March 2020,The movie starts off really slow and difficult to keep engaged. At the middle of the movie things begin to develop. By the end you look back and see how the storyline was constructed. Decent movie but expected more substance.,Captive State
387,northernfz6,One of the better films I watched.,10,5 November 2019,Just finished watching this movie. I was glued to the screen the entire movie. Great acting and an absolute fantastic ending. I'm not going to say anything other than that because you need to watch it.,Captive State
388,petera00-177-105591,Well done - do not pay attention to critics,10,15 March 2019,"This is probably the best sci fi movie to come out since Children of Men. The reviews I've read from this are atrocious... Den of Geek says that the scenes just ""happen."" What?! Isn't that what a movie should be? Geekwire says that the movie lacks a presence of aliens.... WHAT?! This is a thinking man's sci fi with some of the most tense scenes filmed that I've seen for a long time. This is what would happen in a police state.... Go into it with a fresh approach and you will leave ultimately satisfied. Don't go into it thinking it's some super hero movie... Because honestly Joseph Campbell's a heros journey can only be told so many times. And in all honestly - this is the best movie thus far of 2019.",Captive State
389,woodfil,Not my cup of tea,3,22 March 2019,Captive State just never got off to a good star. What you see in the beginning was confusing. It never really showed how the earth lost control to an alien society. It seemed like there were too many side stories that didn't really add to the movie. I got bored a quarter into and actually lost interest in the story. The editing was choppy with some so dark you couldn't see what was happening.,Captive State

391,johnswarbrick,A disturbing hint of the near future?,10,20 June 2019,"First of all DO NOT listen to the bad reviews this movie is getting. Blame the poor reviews on the brain dead idiots doing the reviews and not this excellent movie.
This movie is for the free thinkers and truth seekers out there in the world.I have not been as disturbed and scared by a SCI-Fi film like this, since Children of Men. Why would a movie like Captive State freak me out as much as did? because the current world system is so close already, to the dystopian nightmare portrayed on the screen. It is 100% realistic and 100% believable. One can remove the alien element and replace them with fallen angels or human beings and it still would be highly disturbing and a very frightening story.
Excellent characters and brilliant story coupled with a solid production. This movie cares more about the narratives than flashy over the top special effects, it requires the viewer to engage their grey matter and buy into the story. This movie is a precursor to the one world order the elite will herald in for real in the very near future, so get ready. Truth is in the movies and the lies are in the news. You have been warned.",Captive State

394,maznblu-06359,Anxiety inducing film,9,5 April 2020,The film starts off slowly and the plot meanders a bit but as a plan is put in motion you are not quite sure who to trust. It creates one of the most intense and anxiety producing reactions I've ever had watching a movie. The ending is satisfying and earned. I'm sure there are plot holes that I ignored but I was thoroughly entertained and stressed out while watching.,Captive State
395,jsklein-92779,"Great, unique science fiction",8,19 March 2019,"If you are a fan of both science fiction and dystopian fiction, this is a movie for you. Goodman is a consistent performer, and shows up well. Minimal scares and action, but full of suspense and intrigue.",Captive State
396,oyshalt,"Omg, John Goodman be my daddy!",7,11 January 2021,"My review is by no means to objectively. The movie is not the sci-fi adventure I would normally find appealing. Though it has quite a few interesting and original features, and is absolutely worth watching.
For me, it's all about John Goodman's character and the sympathy and love I felt about him at the end. Beautiful!",Captive State

400,wclaessen,Horrible Mess,1,10 February 2020,"In a way it's good thing I recorded this so I could keep backing it up when I repeatedly lost interest. IMDB needs to do something about the reviews on this site. There is no way anyone could think or rate this movie more than a one or two star movie. There was no character development and seriously nothing to keep me interested in watching this movie. Ugh, I don't know where to go to review this mess of a movie, there was nothing remotely good about it I'd rather sit through Mars Attacks three or four times then finish watching this. I had to turn it off because I seriously could care less how it ended.",Captive State
401,DJesusUncrossed,The only thing they held Captive was my patience while watching this movie,3,21 March 2019,"After seeing the first trailer for this movie, I thought this would be thought provoking sci-fi movie. That being said, this movie does not provoke any thoughts at all. It's badly written, directed, edited, and shot. The movie itself is ambiguous, without subtlety, or care for the craft being put onto the screen.What does this mean? Well for starters, the editing is just plain bad, cutting to different angles every two seconds to pointless close-up reactions of characters, which brings no impact to a scene whatsoever. There's a huge lack of shots that go beyond 10 seconds, making it a headache to know or notice certain elements of the set. It reminded of the god awful ""Oscar winning"" Bohemian Rhapsody, which couldn't stand switching angles at each word being said. There's no focus on a single character in each scene, often talking about set pieces that we can't even see due to the obnoxious editing the movies has.Speaking of no focus, the writing in this movie was just held captive by the amount of pointless montages, characters, and unneeded ambiguity to the overall story being told. Often times when a character is introduced we focus on him/her for a few scenes before disappearing and showing up after 20 minutes. There's also just so many pointless montages in the movie, like most of the second act is just convoluted with scenes that just make no sense at all. Which brings me to my biggest point in the writing. What was the point at all? The writing is needlessly ambiguous and mysterious that it's seemingly all over the place. I know that too much exposition is bad, but having no exposition at all in a movie that's the sci-fi equivalent of Liam Neeson's Taken, just makes me scratch my head. Like where did this come from? What is that thing he has there? Who is this character who just appeared? Why are they in this place now? It's all just so mysterious and fast paced at the same time, that it just doesn't make any sense at all.This brings me to the biggest flaw of this movie, the directing. When you have a screenplay as ambiguous as this one, you'd expect a little more subtlety in the visuals, shot compositions, pacing, and overall flow of the story. Instead it's all just so heavily fast paced that is counteracts with the ambiguity the screenplay has set the movie up. Often times the movies would just be trapped in this roundabout of shots, that just seem so uninteresting and repetitive. And I know this film has a short budget, and if that would be the case, then why would most of the visuals be so ""in your face"" at times. And these visuals are not good looking as well, a lot of the times they are badly rendered, looking like a villain from a Power Rangers show. These flaws just make the story and script look so much worse, a good director would've have had tried to make all that work at visually or technically.Captive State is a movie that will want you test your patience with a film that's ironically holding itself captive. The editing almost gave me a headache, the screenplay was somehow over and underwritten at the same time, and the directing is just so awful that it just breaks the movie apart even more.I was pissed because the story and the world had potential, but everyone who worked on the movie didn't want to use that potential. If you like John Goodman, sci-fi movies, or the two combined (my reason for watching this movie) then go watch it. But overall, this movie was more disappointing than my divorce. I'd give this shit show a 3/10.",Captive State
402,karrie-92341,The last 15 minutes still can't rescue this movie.,5,9 June 2019,My husband and I had NO clue what was going on during this movie. He fell asleep. I'm glad I hung on because the last 15 minutes were actually pretty good however I did have to read Wikipedia to REALLY understand what happened. I still don't think the last 15 minutes were good enough to justify watching 😔,Captive State
