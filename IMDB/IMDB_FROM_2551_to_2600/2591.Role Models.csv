0,bkoganbing,Roles of a lifetime,6,23 July 2018,"Role Models is certainly something Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott never 
aspired to be. These two have a gig going around to various schools, Scott in
the costume of the legendary Greek mythological creature the Minotaur and
Rudd delivering an anti-drug pitch to our middle schoolers with some energy
drink called the Minotaur which is liquid sugar. Creating a diabetic crisis for the
following generation to deal with.After a presentation that lays an ostrich egg these two get into an altercation
with a tow truck operator it's jail or community service with a big brother type
program run by Jane Lynch.Rudd gets to bond with Christopher Mintz-Plasse a nerdy kid who is into live
action Mazes&Monsters type role play and Scott draws Bobbie J. Thompson a
kid with a sewer mouth that repels everyone else.The film is the story of how it works out for both men and the surrogate little
brothers they've drawn. All coming nicely together in a very funny in a park
where both men and young Thompson get into Mintz-Plasse's live action
medieval tournament.Rudd and Scott really get into their characters or maybe I should say they
build a bit of character in themselves and their charges. It's a nice comedy brought off well by a fine cast.",Role Models
1,SnoopyStyle,some sharp humor,8,7 March 2015,"Anson Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny Donahue (Paul Rudd) are traveling promoters for an energy drink company. Wheeler is a slacker womanizer. Danny is devoted to lawyer Beth (Elizabeth Banks) and bitter that his life is going nowhere. In desperation, he asks her to marry him. Of course, she breaks up with him. Danny gets into a fight with a tow truck driver causing damage to the school. Beth gets them community service and they become big brothers to Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who's obsessed with Live-Action-Interactive-Role playing-Explorers (basically LARP) and foul-mouthed Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson). Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) runs the program.Paul Rudd is a great grump and gets in some good rants. Seann William Scott is doing his usual womanizing slacker. Mintz-Plasse is touching as the LARP nerd. He has a sweet relationship with Rudd. There is something funny about a foul-mouthed little kid. There are a lot of inappropriate laughs and there's a sweet feel-good movie at its center.",Role Models
2,Prismark10,Calling Dr Love,4,12 June 2018,"Danny (Paul Rudd) and Anson (Seann William Scott) are energy drink promoters, a bit like Red Bull but this stuff makes your urine go green. When Danny's girlfriend breaks up with him he gets into a fight with a tow truck driver after a drinks promotion at a school and both end up getting community service.They enrol in a program run by Gayle (Jane Lynch) an ex drug addict where they are mentors to younger kids. Danny gets Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who is heavily into dungeons and dragons type role playing. Danny gets a foul mouthed young black kid called Ronnie. Both initially do their community service to count down their hours but realise they need to do more to help these kids and bond with them.Role Models has six credited writers and yet manage to make a forgettable film. It was not until Ken Jeong showed up playing the king in the medieval role playing segment that I realised I had seen this film before!It is an uneasy mixture of bawdy, crude with cloying sentimentality of letting kids be themselves and not let parents mess them up. This might be true for Augie whose mum just wants him to be normal and be out of her way so she can be with her boyfriend. However I cannot buy that Ronnie is so foul mouthed and annoying because his father left him when he was young. We see his mum as loving and supportive.As for the main characters they play the type they have played before. Scott is a variation of Stifler, Rudd is the rather bland sarcastic type, his girlfriend seems to have dumped him because he is not boring enough. Only Jane Lynch gets the best lines as the ex crackhead. The final role playing battle where our main characters come in dressed as members of the rock group Kiss is fun.",Role Models
3,claudio_carvalho,"In the End, Everybody Shall Be Moron to Be Happy",5,15 June 2011,"Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott) are old pals and work selling the energetic Minotaur in schools. Wheeler loves his job wearing a Minotaur costume but Danny hates it. When Danny proposes his girlfriend, the lawyer Beth (Elizabeth Banks), to marry him, she declines since he is very unhappy with his life. The upset Danny has an argument with Wheeler and when he finds that their truck is pulled by a tow-truck for parking in a wrong place, Danny causes an accident with his truck and destroys a school's property.Beth defends them in court and they are sentenced by the judge to work with troubled boys in community service for thirty days in the Sturdy Wings, ruled by the ex-addicted Sweeny (Jane Lynch); otherwise, they will be sent to jail. Danny is assigned to be big brother of the problematic Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a teenager that loves to participate in a game where each member performs a part of a Middle-Age society while Wheeler shall stay with bawdy boy Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson). Along their assignment, Danny and Wheeler feel sometimes that it would be better off going to jail; but in the end, they feel happier with their lives.The overrated ""Role Models"" is a brainless film that certainly makes laugh with the stupidities of Danny, Wheeler, Augie, Ronnie and Sweeny. However, besides the message that everyone shall do what makes him or her happy, the story is pointless and also gives the feeling in the end that everybody shall be moron to be happy. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Faça o que Eu Digo, mas não Faça o que Eu Faço"" (""Do What I Say, but don't Do What I Do"")",Role Models
4,kosmasp,I want Sean William Scott as my mentor,9,5 June 2021,"Wait do I? Well the character he's playing ... and maybe way back in the day, when that would have actually achieved something. Although I have to admit, I probably would not have been able to have the same chemistry he has with his ""little"" in the movie right here.A movie that is quite over the top - you can tell the chemistry between the two leads is amazing. I don't condone all the behaviour or treatment they give each other (sometime crossing the line into reality, like when Rudd hits Scott in a very sensitive region ... for real), but I love their friendship. So the director seems to know his stuff when it comes to bromances (see also I love you man and other things he has done) and also casting the right people, at the right time.Also there a jokes in here that make me wonder ... Paul Rudd for example jokes about the Ghostbusters (who you gonna call?) ... I mean that cannot be a coincidence right? He's going to be in the long awaited third one ... that is ... I mean he must have a time machine, not just because he is ageless ... also he jokes about Banners (Hulk) ... well urin - but that can only be seen in the deleted scenes.I watched the extended cut and the theatrical cut right after it with the audio commentary back to back. I can recommend that to anyone who likes good comedy that does not care about political correctness, but has a heart of gold ... or maybe it is something else ... but it is precious for sure!",Role Models
5,jboothmillard,Role Models,7,7 June 2011,"I saw bits and pieces and maybe a trailer for this film, I didn't really think much of it at the time, I thought it might be terrible, but then I saw positive reviews and was instantly turned to see it. Basically Anson Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny Donahue (Paul Rudd, also writing) are friends in their early thirties that have a pretty dead end job promoting the energy drink Minotaur and encouraging kids to stay off drugs. They get into a big fight and they could face either thirty days in jail or perform 150 hours of community service, they opt for the community service in which they are assigned to be a big brother program called Sturdy Wings. Recovering drug addict manager Sweeny (Jane Lynch) is the one who has to keep an eye of them and make sure that they log the time they spend with the children until they have completed the hours. Danny is paired up with August 'Augie' Farcques (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who is a geeky teenager obsessed with playing medieval role play games like they are real, and Wheeler is paired up with Ronnie Shields (Bobb'e J. Thompson) the little foul mouthed streetwise black kid obsessed with boobs. Danny can't be on the level with Augie, and Wheeler cannot get Robbie to pay interest in anything, they think about the jail option, but they do gradually bond with their ""littles"", Ronnie taking interest in Wheeler's love for the rock bank Kiss and equally boobs, and Danny joins in with the medieval role play. Their success with the young ones goes downhill though when Danny and the role play with King Argotron (The Hangover's Ken Jeong) of ""LAIRE"" gets out of hand, and Wheeler forgets about Ronnie at a boozy party. They are removed from the Sturdy Wings program and will presumably go to jail, but Danny's girlfriend Beth Jones (Slither's Elizabeth Banks) says she will defend them in court, but they find a way to make up for their mistakes. Danny convinces King Argotron to allow him and Augie to take part in the big afternoon Battle Royale fight in the afternoon to ""capture the kingdom of Xanthia"", and with Wheeler and Ronnie joining they all dress as the four members of Kiss, and even though friend Sarah (Michelle Lenhardt) wins it all ends well. In the end Wheeler and Danny are forgiven by Sweeny seeing them take care of the children and their community service is complete. Also starring Ken Marino as Jim Stansel, Kerri Kenney-Silver as Lynette and A.D. Miles as Martin. Scott as always is great as the slacker like booby loving ""adult"", Rudd is also good as his friend, and the two kids Mintz-Plasse and especially Thompson are good fun, there are the small moments of slapstick and plenty of dialogue based jokes, it is an enjoyable comedy. Very good!",Role Models
6,paul_haakonsen,Funny and witty...,6,28 December 2015,"This movie was actually better than what I had initially anticipated. And it was primarily because of the characters, the storyline and also because of the cast. There is just something hilarious and lovable about these types of geeky comedies. Sure, it is not award winning material, but it provides proper entertainment and good laughs.While many aspects of this movie is as generic as it gets, then the storyline was well-constructed and brought to life on the screen.The cast was doing good jobs with their given roles and characters. Paul Rudd really carried the movie singlehandedly. And it was a shame that Ken Jeong didn't have a bigger role, because he is just downright hilarious.There is a lot that might be appealing to you if you enjoy these types of comedies. I was genuinely surprised with this movie and I was entertained. So ""Role Models"" is well-worth watching should you be looking for a comedy with a good story and equally good characters.",Role Models
7,Quinoa1984,"a bleepin' funny movie... the kind that might make you say bleep a lot, or join LAIRE",7,30 November 2008,"There's a joy to watching smart writing with totally tasteless dialog, and Role Models fulfills that joy even while staying fairly predictable with most recent comedies. Anybody familiar with the ""Apatow formula"" (in quotes since there isn't really one unless you've not watched many comedies ever) knows the shlubs or outsider characters put into an extraordinary (or untenable or just strange) set of circumstances, there's some bonding or growing closer romantically or just emotionally, the third-act kicks off with a conflict that is understandable but all connected with the plot mechanics, and everything ends pretty close to a purity of 'tidy'. Luckily, the director, David Wain, has his own way of doing things, not too dissimilar to Apatow's bunch, which is to fill in these plot points with fantastic comic actors and enough improvisation to impress the Upright Citizens convention.So, in short, the movie is very funny, sometimes so much so that you'll laugh for several seconds just about what you just laughed at (the Marvin Hamlisch line in this instance was one of those, plus anything having to do with KISS), and features Paul Rudd in another good disaffected-character turn and Seann William Scott's funniest in so long as I can remember. The premise, which is slightly thin but fine nevertheless, is that Rudd and Scott play kind-of friends working for an energy drink company (the truck itself is a larf aimed at the Minotaur) and after a particularly bad day Rudd drives the truck through a horse statue and the two of them get sent to community service looking after awkward/deviant children. Then, as want to happen, they bond with the kids (one a curse-a-second black kid and a young teen dork with his obsession being LAIRE role-playing ala D&D) and one or two lessons are learned on love and friendship and so on.This premise could work with just Rudd and Scott, who are capable actors, but the minor genius here is to surround themselves with funnier or just go-for-broke people. Jane Lynch, for example, not only steals every scene she's in but threatens to steal the entire movie as the ex-coke head manager of the 'Wings' center for the kids, as she has replaced all of her drugs and ""BS"" for, well, the children. On top of this is also Superbad's McLovin (Mintz-Plasse) as Auggie, the role-playing nerd who brings out the best (or just the un-tapped de-cynical) in Rudd, and the newcomer (Thompson) who plays the young kid with the libido of a 20 year old (or would-be libido) and the mouth of a two-ton sailor. For the latter, he almost becomes a little wearisome with a kind of ""shtick"" of the kid saying (insert f bomb or crazy insult) every few seconds - and yet, this, as with the LAIRE fighting and the gratuitous sex stuff (there's an Ambien joke that kind of rocks, plus a quick one-liner about a child sex-trade that's a bleeping winner, scuse the language), doesn't get too irksome of corny or whatever.If you need to watch a dirty comedy with kids and crazy nerd stuff and fake medieval fighting and another good Paul Rudd performance - ye turn here. 7.5/10",Role Models
8,michaelRokeefe,Juvenile comedy at best.,4,19 March 2009,"Make up your own mind. Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it is comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; Wheeler(Seann William Scott)and Danny(Paul Rudd),two energy drink salesmen, to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies. Supporting are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.",Role Models
9,hitchcockthelegend,Suck it Reindeer Games!,8,20 October 2012,"Role Models is directed by David Wain who also collectively writes the screenplay with Timothy Dowling, Paul Rudd and Ken Marino. It stars Paul Rudd, Sean William Scott, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bobbi'e J. Thompson, Elizabeth Banks and Jane Lynch. Music is by Craig Wedren and cinematography by Russ T. Alsobrook. Two energy drink salesmen (Rudd and Scott) are ordered to perform 150 hours of community service as punishment for an offence that occurred when their company vehicle was about to be towed. For their service, the two men work at a program called Sturdy Wings that is designed to pair kids with adult role models.Personally I avoided it until now because it just sounded like another lame American bawdy comedy about two slacker dudes who create chaos and then grow up by the end credits. This in spite of the fact that I rate Rudd highly and have often found Scott watchable in small doses. As it happens, the film follows the standard formula of plotting but rises above it with funny dialogue, a commitment to its characters and an avoidance of the sort of treacle thick sentimentality that is out of place in this type of comedy. It's also expertly performed by the cast, with the youngsters doing their shift admirably.Yep, there's adherence to poignancy and type, while the odd scene just comes off as being too smug and clever. But there's so much fun to be had here it doesn't hurt the film, it's a true pick me up if you are feeling down, a splendid case of a cast finding chemistry across the board and delivering on the promise of the zippy script. 8/10",Role Models
10,jotix100,Community service punishment,6,2 May 2010,"Danny and Wheeler are two men that go around different schools around L.A. selling a product that is an antidote for kids to abstain from drugs. Danny, whose job is getting him in a rut, goes berserk one day, crashing his Minotaur vehicle into a statue in front of the school he just visited. That lands the duo in jail. As punishment, the judge orders them to serve the 150 hours of community service in an organization that sponsors young trouble youngsters by being sort of 'big brothers'.Danny, whose engagement to Beth, his lawyer girlfriend, is going through some bad moments, gets irritated at trivial things, perhaps venting his own frustration. Beth resents his attitude toward the serving staff at their local Starbucks when Danny questions the definition for the 'venti' size, which he thinks is ridiculous. Things get worse from that moment on, and Beth decides to leave him. Since Danny has no other choice, he comes to Beth to represent him as a lawyer.Wheeler and Danny land up in an institution where they are paired to Ronnie and Augie, two troubled boys with no men to guide them. Things don't go too well for either Wheeler, or Danny. They don't get sympathy from the founder of the Gayle Sweeney, the former dope addict that founded the organization. Since both men have to face a 30 days prison sentence, they decide to stick with the program.""Role Models"" is a formula film by David Wain, who had done better before. Still, Mr. Wain manages to make us laugh with all the silly situations in the film. The screenplay was written by the director, Paul Rudd, the star of the picture and Ken Marino, that plays in it. Seann William Scott, plays the funny part of the duo, while Paul Rudd is the straight man that gets exasperated by the situation he has been dealt. The best thing in the film is Jane Lynch, who steals the film from the stars. Elizabeth Banks, Bobb'e Thompson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse appear to have fun playing Ronnie and Augie.",Role Models
11,dbborroughs,Good,6,29 April 2009,"Two guys end up having to perform community service get stuck being a big brother to two impossible kids and ending up making everything better all around. Last night was my second go round with this film, it was such a big hit the first time that I completely blocked it from my memory (what can I say I had no memory that I saw this a while ago until I started to recall sequence after sequence). Its an amusing comedy but isn't all that special because the film seems to insist on following formulas, the formulas do produce laughs and some kind of feel good moments, but one can't help but think how much better this could have been if it had actually tried to do something different. I liked it but its good enough that I wish it as better.",Role Models
12,view_and_review,Mentoring Hilarity,7,28 June 2021,"""Role Models"" is a hilarious movie about mentoring. It's about growing up while also being a kid. Two guys who work for Minotaur---an energy drink company that can easily be thought of as Red Bull---wind up facing the decision of 30 days in jail or 150 hours of community service. Like most people, Wheeler (Sean William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd) chose community service. For their community service they had to be ""bigs"" to two ""littles.""Wheeler's ""little"" was a foul-mouth little kid named Ronnie who had an affinity for ""boobies."" Wheeler was uniquely suited to mentor him because boobies were this over-sexed guy's specialty.Danny's ""little"" was a much older kid who was perpetually in character for his role-playing group of live action Dungeons and Dragons types. But Danny wasn't suited to mentor anyone as he was too nihilistic. He hated everything which led his girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks) to break up with him. She couldn't deal with his toxicity.There was much hilarity as the two bigs stumbled their way through their court-appointed mentoring and tried to avoid jail.",Role Models
13,george.schmidt,Rudd and Scott make for a dynamic comic duo; one of the year's funniest films,9,9 December 2008,"ROLE MODELS (2008) *** Paul Rudd, Seann William Scott, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bobb'e J. Thompson, Elizabeth Banks, Jane Lynch, Ken Jeong, Ken Marino. Hilarious high-concept comedy about two co-workers (Rudd -who co-scripted the screenplay with director David Wain - and Scott) who wind up having to commit to community service in mentoring a pair of kids (Mintz-Plasse and Thompson, each a riot in their own way) in a Big Brother-like program and realize they themselves have a lot of growing up to do. Immature and hysterically funny, this arrested development comedy is crude and surprisingly sweet and Rudd serves his usual dry snarky wit with verve (his bit in a coffee house about the word 'venti' is worth the price of admission) while Scott acquits himself nicely. Thompson, a mini-Eddie Murphy, steals the show as the foul-mouthed charge and the always reliable Lynch is a hoot as a former 12-stepper who runs the outfit the duo find themselves in. One of the year's funniest films.",Role Models
14,neil-476,Really enjoyed it despite reservations,9,14 January 2009,"Wheeler (Seann ""Stifler"" William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd) are co-workers promoting health drink Minotaur. This involves travelling around to schools where Wheeler wears a Minotaur suit and Danny delivers a pro-Minotaur and anti-drug message. The trouble is that Danny is very dissatisfied with life - he seems to be suffering an early mid-life crisis to the extent that his girlfriend moves out. This depresses him even further, resulting in an incident which leaves the two co-workers facing a choice - 30 days in jail or community service. Choosing community service, the two men find themselves sent to an agency which pairs them up with young people who need adult mentoring. Danny is paired with Augie, an awkward adolescent nerd with an overriding interest in LAIRE (a game which involves battle enactments while dressed in Dungeons and Dragons gear, which explains why Augie goes around wearing a cape), and Wheeler is paired with Ronnie, a black 12 year old with a preoccupation with sexual matters, especially breasts. Fortunately this coincides with Wheeler's own interests: less fortunately, it does not stop Ronnie's highly toxic attitude towards almost everything. And so a movie which is essentially a four-hander between the two men and their young charges begins to play out...I'm not thrilled about the proliferation of foul language in movies, and I'm even less thrilled about that language in the hands - or mouths - of young people. And there is a fair amount of that in this film. And yet I loved this movie.I think that this is because of the character development arcs through which Danny, Wheeler, Augie and Ronnie travelled. They all came across as believable people, and the effects they had on each other were both believable and rather heart-warming.And much of the film is very, very funny.All those involved perform well, but the two youngsters in particular give great performances (incidentally, someone should teach Mr and Mrs Thompson about apostrophes - Bobb'e is an unpronounceable affection and irritates me beyond measure), and Jane Lynch as agency boss Gayle gives us a very funny picture of a woman with one foot in the real world, and another somewhere else, I'm not sure where.For those interested in such things, the boobage factor is low in terms of screen duration but high in terms of quality.",Role Models
15,evanston_dad,Of Kids and Adults (But Which Is Which?),7,18 November 2008,"Though ""Role Models"" doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the boys-behaving-badly movie genre, it's a worthy addition.The bad boys this time around are Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott, two pals who go around to high schools selling an energy drink called Minotaur. Rudd is gloomy, depressed and unfriendly. He starts fights with cafe baristas over what they call their drinks and hates people who use air quotes. Scott is the skirt chaser, irresponsible and high on life. When the two land themselves in legal trouble, they are assigned to community service in order to avoid jail time. Their service involves being big buddies to two kids, one a potty-mouthed spitfire (Bobb'e J. Thompson) and the other a geek with a fantasy game obsession (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of ""Superbad"" fame).Everything plays out as you would expect for a movie like this (I believe Manohla Dargis has referred to the style of movies like this as ""sitcom functional""). The kids take to the adults as father-figures lacking in their own lives; the adults learn to stop acting like kids. Generation X will get a particular kick out of the film, for there are tons of references to 1980s movies and Scott's love of the rock band KISS plays a major role. The film was a little slow to get started, but by the end I was having a great time.The cast also features the ubiquitous Elizabeth Banks as Rudd's girlfriend and, notably, Jane Lynch, giving a whacked out performance as head of the big brother volunteer organization.Grade: B+",Role Models

Thompson, Elizabeth Banks: Title states that role models are those people who are there for children. The problem is that the advertizing poster showcases drunkenness and urination on walls, which defuses any positive message on the bases of being believable. Rushed premise regards Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott given community service mentoring children. What is truly wrong is the profanity coming from a fifth grader. Directed by David Wain with cheap production and a total lack of sincerity. Rudd was recently rejected by his girlfriend. Scott teaches a boy about graphic sexuality. Together they portray characters unfit to monitor a plant let alone a child. The fact that they become positive role models is completely phony. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays a kid obsessed with fantasy. He is the type of kid who is subject to bullying and it isn't difficult to see why. Bobb'e J. Thompson plays the foul mouthed kid mentored by Scott. Thompson is perhaps the most disturbing element in the film. Elizabeth Banks wastes her comedic talent as the dull lawyer / girlfriend to the Rudd character. Despite the performances the film acts as no role model particularly within the boundaries it crosses.

At first highly skeptical, the duo soon realize that they can learn from their court-mandated 'kids' as vice versa.The film moves at a brisk enough pace, and while never hilarious, it has it's moments and is a bit better then the trailer would lead you to believe despite an utterly predictable story-line.

18,zetes,"Nothing too special, but amusing enough; rent it",7,9 November 2008,"Quite predictable little comedy in the Apatow vein, though that producer had nothing to do with this film. It starts off kind of silly and smutty, and ends up somewhat sweet and touching. It may be nothing particularly special, but it's entertaining. Paul Rudd is a comedic actor I could watch in pretty much anything, and Sean William Scott is better than his reputation. The two kids, Christopher Mintz-Plasse (who of course played McLovin in Superbad last year) and Bobb'e J. Thompson, are both pretty good. Best among the cast is Jane Lynch as the woman who runs the volunteer program Rudd and Scott are ""volunteered"" for. She's got such a wry comic sensibility, and her tirades about being a BS detector and her cocaine-fueled past are the funniest parts of the movie. Wry comedy is what defines director Wain and his crew from The State, many of whom appear in this film (Joe Lo Truglio, Kerry Kenney-Silver and Ken Marino). This is Wain's most commercial and least personal work. I thought last year's The Ten was his best film. Other familiar faces include Matt Walsh and A.D. Miles.

20,mm-39,fine line between funny and weird!,3,16 May 2011,"In comedy, there is a fine line between funny and weird. There is a lot of shock comedy in this film. However, much of the film's comedy gets across as weird. How many weirdo rants from co-workers or listening to spoiled children swearing is shocking? There is no shock or humor with this when all one has to do is watch the Springer show or go to their job. I like the Danny character. I can relate with his pessimistic, and blunt attitude when one has to deal with all the crap life gives us. Many of us would like to say and do a few things Danny says and does in some of life's situations. The movie ended strong, but the over shock jokes and choppy delivery of some of the humor in the first two thirds of the film was too much. I give the movie a 3 out of 10. The movie is similar to a comedy club routine which is gross, shocking, but goes over badly on film.",Role Models
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Role Models,7,21 February 2009,"No man is an island, and deciding to be miserable all the time is not going to make life any easier. You'd either grin, bear it and look on the bright side, or stay a sour puss and irritate everyone with that attitude. Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott) are colleagues who are pimping an energy drink for 10 years, one the evangelist who preaches, while the other prances around in the mascot Minotaur suit.Unhappy with having nothing to show for, and going through the motions day after day, Danny finally snaps one fine day in a moment of madness, and the duo gets offered a choice of either jail time, or community service hours. Not wanting to be raped in jail (yes, it's that insane), they opt for community service, and get thrown into a baby-sitting service where adults volunteer time to spend with children who are a little bit special. In that sense, Wheeler gets to be the buddy of Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), whose mouth is way bigger and vulgar than his size, while Danny got to pair up with Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of McLovin fame from Superbad), the nerd whose life revolves around a fantasy cosplay world whose players gather in a park to enact their medieval dreams.Needless to say this comedy relies plenty on the pairing of misfits to draw some laughter, and I'd admit I got the kicks out of that little swearing kid with a penchant for boobies. And faster than you can say ""formula"", you can bet your last dollar that amongst the pair they will learn how to trust, respect and eventually learn from each other. After all, that's what friends are for. And adding to the humour in almost every scene she's in is Jane Lynch as the founder of the Big Brother program, being an ex-con/abuser/etc who can smell BS from a mile away, the bane of both Danny and Wheeler.While one can stay almost one step ahead all the time in what the story would throw up next, the delivery here mattered, and thankfully none of the actors here irritated nor put you off their characters. What worked also were the plenty of sly, subtle jokes that flew by, some which would have you do a double take in ""did they really say that?"", and the numerous references on pop culture, and the more obvious dig on the metal band KISS.Elizabeth Banks might have been given the role of her life thus far in Zack and Miri Make a Porno, though here she plays the obvious second fiddle in a negligible supporting role as the girlfriend of Danny who dumps him because of his negativity. Paul Rudd seems stuck in playing characters who have indifference for breakfast, while Sean William Scott is pretty much type-casted already, with almost each role being a dude. Time for him to try and break out of that mold, if at all possible. Not that I'm complaining of course.But the two boys literally stole the thunder here with their crazy antics, with Ronnie the outspoken boy who shoots his mouth off, while Augie is the exact opposite in his more hesitant and timid performance. Those familiar with Superbad will spot Mr McLovin here as Augie. If not for the language and nudity, this would make it somewhat of an above average comedy that all ages could enjoy. So pity the kids would miss out on cursory messages like leading the life you want to and to stand up for yourself, while the rest of us who are in the mood for some laughs, may want to check this out. As the saying goes, nothing fancy, but surprisingly it works.",Role Models
22,namashi_1,A Joyride.....,6,27 September 2009,"A film like 'Role Models' promises to entertain, and trust me it lives up-to it's promise completely. However, I would like to state that: 'Role Models' is meant for those who enjoy cinema, not for those who look for a 'Titanic' or 'The Shawshank Redemption' is every other f'''king film! Please those head-weighted are not worth a film like this. And cine-lovers who enjoy films for their sheer beauty should not miss 'Role Models'.Directed neatly by filmmaker David Wain & smartly performed 'Role Models' entertains in those 100 minutes. I enjoyed this box office hit, and I would love to watch it again!Performance-wise: Seann William Scott & Paul Rudd carry the film on their shoulders. Both are excellent. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is efficient, while Bobb'e J. Thompson is fantastic. The moment he starts to abuse, he carries an Ora throughout. Elizabeth Banks looks gorgeous as ever, and does a commendable job. Jane Lynch stands out. On the whole, give this flick a chance. Thumbs Up!",Role Models
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,So much funnier than I was expecting,8,12 November 2008,"After seeing the trailer for Role Models, I thought it looked like a funny movie, but I wasn't expecting much, I was thinking they might have just shown the great parts in the trailer and that would be it. But I took the opportunity and saw Role Models the other day and I have to say this is completely opposite from what I was expecting, first off I was worried that there was going to be a lot of gross humor and the kids might be more annoying than funny, but it turn out that this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. I just couldn't stop laughing throughout this film, who knew that Sean William Scott could actually be really funny? I know there are a lot of Stiffler fans that will hate that sentence, but I don't remember a time that I laughed so hard at his character. He and Paul Rudd both worked so well together and were terrific on screen, this was the last duo on Earth that I expected such great laughs from.Wheeler and Danny both work for an energy drink company, but after a very hard day for Danny he crashes their company truck on school property, but his ex-girlfriend, Beth, who is a lawyer is able to get them just 150 hours community service with two kids, one is a total dungeons and dragons nerd and the other is just a pain in the butt. You know how the story goes, Danny learns how to be happy and Wheeler finally grows up into a more father figure role.Now the story is something we have seen a million times before, but it's still a great comedy. Jane Lynch who is becoming one of my favorite comedic actresses, you've also seen her in 40 year old virgin, she is just absolutely hilarious in this movie and has all the best lines ""You know what I ate for breakfast? Cocaine. You know what I ate for lunch? Cocaine..."" she is such a great and fun actress to watch on screen. I really loved Role Models, it turned out to be a great comedy and was an absolute blast to watch. I highly recommend if you get the chance to see it, take it, it's a guaranteed laugh.8/10",Role Models
24,KineticSeoul,A funny and touching film with more of the funny,7,7 October 2009,"Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott do what they do best in this film, with Sean William Scott acting like Stifler from the ""American Pie"" movies. So one more serious and the other just plain obnoxious. Anyways this duo go about going from school to school trying to advertise energy drinks in till they get into a accident and are forced to become role models, either that or the choice of going to prison, but the fear of getting raped makes them agree on the other option. I first thought this would be another one of those movies with just bunch of fart jokes thrown in, which can be amusing to watch sometimes but that is just not the case for this movie. This film was actually laugh out loud funny at times, and also goes the bonding and healing direction which actually works pretty well. Although at some points of the movie you might want to say screw this and just kick the crap out of Ronnie Shields the character Bobb'e J. Thompson played if you were in Stifler's position I mean Wheeler, but it was mostly in there for joke purposes. But it was kinda like watching Stifler getting tortured so I guess it added to the amusement. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also did a good job playing the geek, as for Elizabeth Banks. To sum this movie up, it's a funny and touching film and well worth watching. Jane Lynch was also a very funny character actress in this movie, and she is just lovable in just about anything she is in. She is like one of the few that can act like a dike on screen and still be likable.7.5/10",Role Models
25,thesar-2,Mad Role Models 911!,8,9 November 2009,"'Role Models,' they're certainly not, but when it comes to dealing with kids, I would trust these guys over Adam Sandler in 'Big Daddy' any day. OK, not by much, but at least this was a thoroughly more enjoyable movie and you had people to root for. Anyone should prepare themselves for this movie, if you're a movie lover or at least see more than 3 a month, you'll need to dumb yourself down a bit for this movie. Forget all the predictability – if the trailers don't tell you the A-B-C plot this is, the first five minutes will – and you'll probably enjoy this as much as I did. It strongly helps I'm a huge Rudd fan as well as 'MadTV' and 'Reno 911!' I recognized a lot of the cast of both now-defunct shows, but I had no idea about a few of them I recognized, but couldn't place them in their new surroundings/get up, until, of course, I looked them up on IMDb. Again, despite the A-B-C plot, I really laughed out loud, and unfortunately could sincerely relate to the Rudd character. Both Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) get into trouble and must do community service headed up by the 'Glee' lady – outstanding (and nutso) here. They must take care of two boys, a la Big Brother, one a menace, one a soldier. The two ""Biggies"" remain selfish in their predicament, until, well, you know how this will play out. And despite a very convenient ""sitcom"" closing, overall, it's recommendedfor adults. Really, this is a Hard-R, despite messages placed in here for kids. Perhaps they were aiming high for the kid in all of us? Side note: despite the usual leads – Rudd/Scott, it was refreshing them using new cameos, and funny ones to boot.",Role Models

27,ThomasDrufke,Two Kings,7,14 June 2015,"As we all know Paul Rudd is taking on the role of Scott Lang AKA Ant-Man this summer, so I thought I would take a look at some of his other films that I have yet to see. Role Models is a tale of two Energy Drink Salesmen who are having a sort of an early mid life crisis after getting the choice of either 150 hours of community service or 30 days in jail. Of course, there's also a woman at stake, that being Elizabeth Banks, (Rudd's Girlfriend) and she cuts them a deal to work at a big brother program.Seann William Scott acts alongside Rudd in a pretty well done comedy. It's nothing too earth shattering and in fact we have seen a lot of it all before, but I had fun with it. Scott is like a poor mans Chris Pratt in a way, but his comedy hits more often than not. He plays the ladies man and the more laid back guy, while Rudd plays virtually the same character he would play one year later in I Love You Man. And what could have been a big disaster in working with younger actors (not so much Christopher Mintz-Plasse but in Bobb'e J. Thompson, it turned out to have a hilarious dynamic throughout the film. I also loved Ken Jeong as King Argotron. It was a much more toned down comedy than I expected and the less-goofy attitude of the film definitely worked to it's advantage.The film is utterly predictable though and everything gets wrapped up neatly in the end when I thought there should have been some story lines that play out further. Though this film isn't the best Rudd film nor is it overly re-watchable, it's an enjoyable silly comedy that didn't rely on as many stupid jokes as I thought. I also think there is a sweet story beyond all the sexual jokes and innuendos.+Toned down comedy +The kids worked well with Rudd and Scott +More than a silly comedy -Predictable -Wrapped up too nicely 7.0/10",Role Models
28,MLDinTN,Paul Rudd plays a ...,6,6 October 2009,"med-evil knight, sort of, in this film. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Rudd teams up with Sean William Scott in this buddy comedy. The 2 work together advertising the drink Minataur at schools, preaching against drug use. One day after Rudd's girlfriend breaks it off, he goes nuts and drives a truck on top of a statue. The 2 can either do community work or go to jail. They choose to be volunteers and are bigs to littles. Rudd gets a boy that is obsessed with Laire, a game that everyone dresses up from med-evil times and they have battles in the park on weekends. Scott gets stuck with a young kid with a very foul mouth that tries to get his bigs to quit.Of course, at first the 4 aren't that great together, but they become friends and Scott and Rudd get back in the kids' good graces by participating in the battle. They make up their own kingdom and costumes based on Kiss.It's sort of funny at times. But I think this movie seems more for 16 year olds even though there's lots of bad language.FINAL VERDICT: If you don't mind the language, it's OK. You may find it funny.",Role Models

Scott reminded me of his old days from the original American Pie movies. I also have to give credit to Jane Lynch. She is hilarious as the social worker.This is about two people whose jobs are advertising energy drinks. Unfortunately for them they are involved in very wild behavior. To avoid jail time, they are forced to spend time with children as part of their punishment. But children can be trouble.This is hilarious. There are plenty of funny scenes especially the ones where they try to recreate a fantasy camp and act like the Lord of the Rings but with different characters.Overall, this is another great movie in the comedy movies that has been coming out lately.

31,inkblot11,"Roll out the accolades, this is a fun and well-conceived film BUT it may be offensive to some",8,7 December 2008,"Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott) work for a company, Minotaur, that makes energy drinks. The firm's marketing strategy is aimed at teenagers, giving young adults an alternative to alcohol and drugs. In this light, Danny, in a suit, and Wheeler, in a Minotaur costume, make the rounds at Los Angeles area schools, where they urge assemblies of kids to stay off the hard stuff and get their ""highs"" by chugging their energy beverages. After the 500th pitch, the gig is wearing away at Danny's enthusiasm. He is also having trouble with his longtime, live-in gal, Beth (Elizabeth Banks), for she is tired of Danny's pessimism, about his job and about life. One day, between school appointments, Danny decides to propose to Beth, an attorney, at her office. She rejects him, sighting his downer demeanor. Stinging mightily, Danny botches his next pitch, has a run-in with a tow truck operator and a policeman, and drives the Minotaur-mobile amok, with Wheeler riding shotgun. The state of California is not pleased. As a consequence, Beth works hard to keep the duo out of jail but, instead, manages to get them a community service sentence as big brothers to troubled boys. Neither of the men is happy and feel they have little to offer children but do not like the idea of jail time, either. In short order, Danny is paired with Augie, a fantasy-minded teenager whose parents wish him to be more ""normal"" while Wheeler gets matched up with Ronnie, a foul-mouthed, wayward pre-teen son of a single mother. Things start off badly, with Ronnie and Augie rejecting their ""bigs'"" initial gestures of kindness. Will Danny and Wheeler complete their service or end up in jail? This is a funny and well-conceived film that has great merit, underneath a slew of bad language and some sexual scenarios. Most of us need a wake-up call to become better people and that's what Danny and Wheeler get, to their benefit and to those around them. As the principal stars, Rudd and Scott are wonderful, funny, and touching. Banks, too, does a nice job, as do the young boys chosen to be the ""littles"". The scenery in California is lovely, as are the costumes and photography. As for the script, which Rudd co-wrote, and the confident direction, they are head and shoulders above most others, for they are strong on humor and intelligence. However, some of the jokes are definitely going to offend, so if you are one who likes family-acceptable comedy, this is not the film for you or your loved ones. Nevertheless, in today's economic condition, money spent on Role Models, either by purchase or rental, is coinage well-spent, for it rolls out the laughs and lessons with gusto.",Role Models
32,Floated2,Could have been funnier,6,22 August 2009,"I saw this film on Friday evening (08/21/09) and though I didn't quite get the belly laughs from it that a previous critic did, it was highly amusing with some clever running jokes - particularly the disingenuous double-entendres which were peppered throughout the movie. What spoiled it for me was how obvious and predictable and tied up all the loose ends in one fell swoop.For me a good film is made complete by an ending which doesn't seem rushed or mangled and one that doesn't leave you with the feeling of ""is that it?"". The ending of Role Models is very predictable. One positive that was real funny was hearing the black kid searing so much on screen. The was funny yet odd. There were many parts that I found unfunny yet my friends found hilarious. I did laugh at some moments but not really out loud (just a chuckle). I think this movie is decent but I've seen funnier, it could have been done better. As for a rewatch 05/20/17' Role Models is a solid comedy with some laughs here and there.

34,insomniac_rod,Mindless fun that should be enjoyed by fans of goofy humor!,8,16 August 2009,"When I'm the mood, I'm an extreme goof-head. Hey, I'm not saying that this movie is mediocre in the humor aspect. No, it's a really funny movie that shouldn't be taken seriously.The plot is absurd but delivers when it's executed. And when the chemistry between it's main four characters works, it means you're up for a fun ride. I liked the contrast between the personality of Sean William Scott and Paul Ruud. One is the calmed down guy who is after an ideal life after wasting most of it; Scott displays the womanizer partier. But the real fun comes when they meet Augey Farks and Ronnie. Augey is an ultra nerd who lives in a world filled of magic, and the things like ""The Lord Of The Rings"". He's a loner but has good feelings and a background familiar history that explains a lot. Ronnie is a little vandal with a terrible attitude and vulgar use of words. He's by far my favorite character.Now, my favorite part of the review...the most memorable scenes in my opinion. 1) Ronnie slapping Wheeler in the face before getting out of the car. 2) Wheeler ending up naked in the forest after a long night of sex. 3) The final battle in Augey's...world. 4) Any scene featuring Jane Lynch. 5) Our lead characters crashing the minotaur band. 6) The KISS homage.

35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Well-conceived comedy with a variety of humor,7,12 November 2008,"""Role Models"" is a film that should be looked up to as a truly bankable comedy. The idea of two oddball characters screwing up their lives and being court-ordered to try and make a positive impact on the lives of two oddball kids is simply rich with opportunity and ""Role Models"" milks that for all it's worth.Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) are co-workers that promote their energy drink ""Minotaur"" while simultaneously giving drug talks to schools. Danny has the sudden epiphany after ten years on the job that he's unhappy with his life and it gets him and Wheeler in legal trouble. That brings them to Sturdy Wings, a big brother/big sister program, where Danny is assigned to help Augie (Mintz-Plasse), a teen caught up in the world of medieval role play, and Wheeler to Ronnie (Thompson), a foul-mouthed and quite crude child. Of course, neither of these men are fit to deal with children.The plot sets up several clashes in personality and it results in one of those comedies that never loses sight of the human element. All the characters have problems and their chemistry not only makes us laugh, but causes us to identify with them more, even if their are some soft spots in the script.Rudd is in standard form with his first-rate deadpan. Scott is simply another incarnate of his Stiffler character from the ""American Pie"" movies, but in the context of a smarter film, he comes out much better than he has in any of his recent work. What really makes the comedy tick, however, is its supporting cast. Jane Lynch as the Sturdy Wings director, for example, provides some of the film's most outlandish lines that merely capturing Rudd and Scott's non-verbal reactions to her is enough to make us laugh. There are also a bundle of familiar faces from the Apatow world and other comedy realms that do this successfully too.The jokes range from outright jokes about breasts and drawings of genitalia to parts of dialog simply ending in overt sexual innuendos that you can miss if you're not listening carefully. The film's creator David Wain (""Wet Hot American Summer,"" ""The Ten"") definitely has a presence in the film, but it's clear that Rudd and others assisted in many ways as the humor is not all dry or all crude. There's jokes all along the way, really, and while you may not laugh at all of them, you're guaranteed to laugh at most.It's been awhile since a comedy with a more traditional premise has really been--good--and ""Role Models"" does it.",Role Models

37,jzappa,"""The Season Was Muck With Ryeberries!""",7,27 April 2009,"We need Judd Apatow. Amidst decades' worth of damnable waste in the teen comedy arena which have burned me so many times that I've begun to accept as true that they are all and will all be terrible wastes of celluloid out to win the weekend and concurrently have an adverse effect on most of its audience's sense of quality, sense of humor and senses. But Apatow at the helm has made so many movies one is understandably reticent to see and subsequently surprised and rewarded with huge laughs and enormous entertainment. Not only that, he even tends to relate a great deal to his target audience instead of exploiting them. Role Models is not only ridden with clichés; it is a cliché. But it's not always the material; it's what you do with it.The movie starts off questionably. Everything is too familiar and too lazy. Paul Rudd, who has proved himself a very able comic actor, and Sean William Scott, a veteran of the aforementioned wastes of celluloid, star as two salesmen for an energy drink. They play exactly the characters you would think they'd play: Scott loves the job while Rudd hates it and possesses a constant negative attitude toward life, which results in the collapse of his relationship with his lawyer girlfriend Elizabeth Banks. Yeah? What a surprise. One day after making one of their presentations at a high school, the duo find that their company truck is being towed for parking in a ""No Parking"" zone. In an extremely stupid scene, they protest by trying to drive it away from the tow-truck, but they end up driving it up a statue in front of the school. If anyone recognizes the cop in the scene shown for only a split second to be Louis CK, you're not imagining it. That's right. They cut out one of the funniest working comedians.However. After the whole obligatory exposition is treating precisely as such, complete with their arrest and sentence of 150 hours of community service over the next thirty days, we move at last to the judge's favorite charity, a mentoring program called Sturdy Wings, led by a drug addict-turned-charity worker, played in one of the funniest performances I've seen in a long long time by Jane Lynch. Of course she takes an instant dislike to our two heroes, is aware that their presence at Sturdy Wings is court-ordered and warns them that if they fail to carry out their tasks to her satisfaction, she will have them sent to prison. What she is is a dead-on parody of the overwhelmingly cocky charity worker with the sketchy past full of drug and jail experiences that have left her apparently ""wise,"" yet we see her rattle off jokes perfectly constructed to be painfully bad and volunteer pontificating accounts of perverse drug experiences.So Scott is paired up with a foulmouthed, streetwise miscreant played by a very young actor with shocking presence named Bobb'e J. Thompson. He's obsessed with breasts and has driven away all the other ""Bigs"" he has been paired with, while Rudd is paired up with the precise opposite, a nerdy teenager obsessed with live-action role-playing games, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who I believe has the capability to be the Woody Allen of the next generation. I would like to be able to choose who I found to be the most hilarious player in the cast, but I simply can't. There's the pitch-perfect scene-stealing of Jane Lynch, the two unbearable children Thompson and Mintz-Plasse, and there is Joe Lo Truglio, who plays Kuzzik, a man who believes himself to be a medieval knight and says absolutely ridiculous things like, ""The season was muck with ryeberries!"" and ""Now let us gingerly touch our tips!"" One of the first things he says when he approaches Paul Rudd is, ""Diana has put away her bosom. Apollo has lifted his skirt. The day has been launched,"" there being no Diana or Apollo.Indeed, Mintz-Plasse's character dedicates his life to prevailing in the fantasy realm of a medieval live action role playing game, LAIRE (Live Action Interactive Role-playing Explorers), which is comprised of scores of fully wardrobed players who speak with phony speculative accents and use home-made toy swords, shields and daggers. This plot point goes further than it should. Much much much further. In fact, the film's climax is a campy LAIRE battle in which all the central characters participate. But that in itself is appealing, because while the film has its touching moments of bonding between lost and misunderstood young boys and minimally successful and disillusioned young men, it is essentially ridiculous. For every lethally hysterical joke and gag, there is an equally lame and unnecessary one. But there is real talent brewing here, playing off of razor-sharp social satire.",Role Models
38,elshikh4,A movie about teen characters. The problem is that it is teen itself !,1,8 June 2012,"For a second, it does sound as a very good idea. 2 irresponsible ""old"" teens have to help a pair of troubled ""younger"" teens, to see - finally - themselves in them, trying to seek help altogether. That could have been a story full of self-exploring, friendship and comedy.. Or not!Still the script is the joy killer, or simply the killer, in most of Hollywood movies lately. The rushed industry pushes the script to the edge of nonsense, just about every time, in any of its mainstream production. That potential idea went into deadly easy writing. So instead of watching leads that seek help from each other, I watched an idea that seeks help from such a spoiled and lazy script. Ahhh, why Hollywood movies have to have a teen script, the worst kind too??!!The movie runs as a windbag filthy drunk for most of its time. The endless F words really hurt my ears, and the abundant nudity took the same mission yet to my eyes. I see that swearing and nudity are ugly, so how about tons of them in every Hollywood movie! They, at least here, represent the producers' desire to milk some money from the viewers, or the viewers' adolescence to be specific.While dealing - outwardly - with the problems of adolescence, the movie - in fact - enjoys its adolescence to the max. All what it had to make laughs was using crude language, throwing puerile and dirty sex joke, or the like. At one of the scenes, I got sick of repeating the F word as if there was nothing to say but it. And all what it had to be serious was a big fake fight at the end, being almost the sole watchable thing around, which without it; the movie is literally unredeemable! See how easy the movies of Hollywood are written today?!The cast was considerably a letdown. The black kid was unbearably annoying. I was about smashing the screen, out of rage, when it came to Paul Rudd's bad coldness. Sean William Scott plays the same stuff that he did in his last 20 movies, without laughs as usual (Now how Booooring!). 2 nearly survived: Christopher Mintz-Plasse who was the most truthful and touching (pathetic of course knowing where he was!), and Jane Lynch who showed clickable performance, though I couldn't believe how awful her supposedly comic lines were. You read that many lines were improvised by the actors, due to the 2007 Writers Guild strike which took place during the shooting. Accordingly, what they did come up with was unfunny, rather horrible, drivel. So, it's official: this cast CAN'T IMPROVISE TOO!Is it necessary that a movie about young and old teen characters must be teen itself?! It's more than obvious that the makers of (Role Models) need some Role Models themselves. They can find them in some of Hollywood classics, back when smart and sober people were making movies. But maybe the movie-makers of today are too lazy to watch and learn!Finally, teen movie, teen producers, teen Hollywood, and even in no enjoyable way!",Role Models

But Danny is having the worst week ever, and crashes his company car, with Wheeler in the seat next to him. His soon to be ex girlfriend Beth(Elizabeth Banks) who is a lawyer, manages to avoid getting them jail time, by doing hours of community service, volunteering at a big brother place called Sturdy Wings led by Gayle(Jane Lynch). Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie(Bobb'e J Thompson) who is 10 years old, and has a foul mouth like he's Chris Rock. Danny is assigned to Augie(McLovins, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who likes to dress like a knight, and fight like he is in medieval times. But will this be good for Danny and Wheeler, or will they be better off in jail?Okay I'm not gonna beat around the bush, this movie was very unpleasant in many ways. Namely the Ronnie character, hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young, was very shocking. If he was a little bit older, it would not have mater'd as much. I mean what where his parents thinking, when they sign'd him on to this. Elizabeth Banks character is so unwatchable, maybe I was supposed to feel bad for her character, but I felt nothing, because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies. And Jane Lynch, who's the worst of the worst. She delivers the most overacting performance ever. Playing a former drug addict, who acts like she still is on drugs. Listening to her give all that annoying dialog, made me want to throw my head up against the wall. Seann William Scott once again playing another Stifler like character, he should really try to separate himself, and this film won't do it. And the more Scott tries to hard to be funny, is what keeps him from being funny.Now Paul Rudd on the other hand, I'm gonna separate from the others in the film, cause he manages to deliver a solid performance, although he does not get higher laughs, but he is the most interesting character from the rest. Cause Rudd does not overact, and does not try so hard. The scenes with him and Mintz-Plasse are watchable. But the rest of the film is so stupid, it picks up at times. But it becomes so predictable and uninteresting. It is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new, there all the same, they take no chances.

Given the choice between a short jail sentence and one month working with a kids' organization, the two try their luck at babysitting and, predictably, learn a few basic lessons about fatherhood, maturity and responsibility along the way. The generic plot won't buck even the most gullible audience, but in truth it's really only there to give the trove of supporting comedians something to riff on in every scene. Jane Lynch and about two thirds of the cast of MTV's old cult favorite The State make routine appearances, but the best lines come from Bobb'e Thompson, the kid under Scott's supervision. Though he's paired in almost every scene with Christopher Mintz-Plasse (better known as McLovin in 2007's Superbad), Thompson lives and breathes his character while Plasse is merely filling a stiff, redundant role. Produces a few good laughs, with plenty of opportunities for Lynch to make everyone on-screen and off feel totally uncomfortable, but at the end of the day it's no better than average.",Role Models
41,jimbo-53-186511,It's not just Daniel Powter who's had a Bad Day...,4,25 July 2018,"Two energy drinks reps Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott) end up being enrolled in a Big Brother style program (in order to avoid prison) after they total their vehicle outside a school. The programme (run through a company called Sturdy Wings) involves Bigs (adults) mentoring Littles (kids) and the 2 men find their respective buddies challenging, but over time they soon begin to bond with them and a mutual respect gradually begins to develop...Revolving your narrative around 2 generally unlikeable individuals is always going to be a risky strategy; inevitably this will usually result in audiences reacting in 2 different ways - either they'll hate the protagonists or worse still won't care about them or anything that happens to them. The film skates this fine line all the way through; the protagonists are quite unlikeable, but evidence that they care about their buddies is highlighted at sporadic intervals throughout the film. This results in the film having a narrative that resembles a heart monitor; it goes up and down, up and down, up and down and so on. I've talked about Rudd and Scott's characters being unlikeable, but in retrospect that's probably a little unfair; Rudd's character is possibly a little bit easier to feel sympathy for; he hates his job and finds himself in a bit of a rut where he generally hates his existence and everyone around him - it's believable as I think that everyone feels a bit low at times. Him buddying up with L.A.I.R.E fanatic Augie was awkward at first, but it did give Danny something to focus his attention on and perhaps made him forget about his own problems - sure it's a little clichéd, but it isn't handled too badly here. Danny was a flawed person, but I didn't see him as a bad person and did find myself being able to relate to him. Sadly, the same cannot be said for Wheeler who really doesn't seem to care about anyone else but himself; this is made worse by the fact that he seems to get away with his misdemeanours with no repercussions. Sure he comes through in the end, but I did find his rather selfish and uncaring attitude a little off-putting.I think the really big nail in the coffin here is that it really isn't that funny; I thought the start of the film was good, but found it fell apart slightly when everything moved to Study Wings; in fact it's really left to Mintz-Plasse and Thompson to carry this aspect of the film as they get the best lines and are the funniest things about this film. After the impressive opener, Rudd and Scott kind of look all at sea in the latter aspects of the film although they do still have some funny moments from time to time.All in all, while Role Models isn't a complete waste of time it really isn't all that funny, but at the same time I can't entirely hate it because some heart and thought has been put into the film, but I don't believe that enough has been done to prevent it from being a below average film overall.FINAL NOTE; I would have given it a 5 out of 10, but it lost a star for that cringey final scence. Yuck!!",Role Models

But his partner Wheeler (Seann William Scott) loves his work, especially he's a mascot. When Danny nearly suffers from a nervous breakdown on the job with his partner, they got in trouble with the law. Danny's now ex-girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks), who's a lawyer. She managed to convinced the judge, instead of going to jail. They will do community service for 150 hours at Sturdy Wings. Strudy Wings is a place, where needy or troubled children are befriends with a big brother type person. Danny is team with a overly shy 17 year-old boy named Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's loves doing role playing in Medieval Times place called LAIRE. Wheeler is team with a wild, hyper bad kid named Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), who's loves woman breasts and certainly needs a father figure. Danny and Wheeler are having trouble getting along with these two kids, while the owner (and supervisor) of Strudy Wings named Sweeny (Jane Lynch) is keeping an eye on these two troubled adults.Directed by Davind Wain (Wet Hot American Summer) made an amusing comedy that offers some genuine laughs, vulgarity and gratuitous nudity that adds to the fun. Rudd and Scott are good as the mismatched friends. But Mintz-Plasse and Thompson have their comedic moments as well. This was an surprise box office hit in the fall of 2008. It was also one of the better movies of 2008.The DVD has two versions of the film, both R-Rated and the Unrated Version that includes three minutes of additional footage. The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD offers a jokey commentary track by the director on the R-Rated version, deleted/extended scenes, outtakes and more. The Blu-ray edition offers more special features. ""Role Models"" was one of the funniest comedies of 2008 and this movie offers a few unexpected surprises. It will please the die- hard fans of Rock & Roll band ""KISS"" as well. Don't miss it.

""I like the idea of it more than I actually like it.""Off the wall moments like that are the reason I watch this movie back again and again. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are the straight guys playing against a cast of wackos. I thought the film needed to be a little better balanced between the scenes of the LAIRE game and scenes dealing with Ronnie. It felt like Ronnie's arc got cut short a little bit, whereas we see a more complete story of how Danny helps Augie gain confidence and acceptance. I always like Ken Jeong, but this is one of my favorite roles of his--little details like his ordering the Denver Omlette stuck with me and add to the repeat value.

46,aidanratesmovies,Very enjoyable,9,5 May 2020,"A genuinely funny, surprisingly sweet, and entertaining comedy- Role Models is a little formulaic at times, but it certainly is enjoyable. The film stars Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott, who make for an odd, but great pair that I never thought I would see in a film together. The kids in the films provide the best supporting performances, most notably Bobb'e J. Thompson as Ronnie who is truly hilarious in his role. The film never struggles with pacing throughout, and I was thoroughly entertained and found myself to truly enjoy the film in its entirety. The film does struggle with some formulaic plot devices and a few cliches here and there, but it's able to overcome its somewhat simplistic nature and make for a semi-unique film that is also quite funny. The jokes never seemed too forced, though they seemed like they should be, which I guess is a plus. The music was well appreciated, with a lot of references to KISS and other classic bands. In the end, Role Models isn't a home run, but a damn enjoyable comedy that proved to be a lot better than I expected it to be. It can be corny, and a bit average at times, but its the films unique moments and sense of humor that make it special, and very enjoyable.

Somehow as in real life all turns out well at the end. That is in comedy films it does. This is another of those suspend belief sit back & enjoy.This has a large cast & all are very good. I will just comment on few of them.The two leads are expertly played BY Paul Rudd & Sean William Scott they are 'Big Brothers' to 2 troubled lads Bobb'e Thompson & Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Young Chris, is a newcomer to films,I think he will have a huge career.Elizabeth Banks & are also involved.

But despite the good and uncommonly found premise of being an example to kids, the movie is in fact not for kids. Besides that, there are more than enough frames about body parts that are definitely not for kids. Though some of them are weird and just plain odd, the jokes are actually fun to see. Paul Rudd acted just at an average performance, though he managed to get the calm mood portrayed. Sean William Scott is comfortable and is actually quite like at home depicting a carefree womanizer. Instead I like how Elizabeth Bank's performance turned out to be. She really gives it a nice addition into the whole picture.",Role Models
51,RainDogJr,"""I like to rock 'n' roll all night and part of every day""",9,23 March 2009,"I have in my DVD collection movies like Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad so I had to check this movie. Actually and with the exception of Drillbit Taylor and Pineapple Express (a movie that, unlike Drillbit Taylor, will be part someday of my collection) I have never seen a movie from the Apatow ""team"" on the big screen, actually Judd Apatow hasn't a credit in Role Models but hey here you will have a very familiar cast if you have seen movies like Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad.Anyway, here we have Paul Rudd and Seann William Scoot playing our two main characters, but is until McLovin and Bobb'e J. Thompson appear when the real fun begins. Actually this is a basic movie, we have two good friends who will be in jail however there's an opportunity to avoid jail, they will take this opportunity but things will be difficult but at one point everything is fine just to have the final big problem before the nice ending with every problem solved. So yes, is nothing mind blowing in that way however basically since McLovin and Bobb'e J. Thompson appear most moments of the movie are just hilarious and in the end it does feel fresh. I saw Role Models on DVD last night with some familiars including my cousin and we both were like ""that black kid f****** rocks!"", he is just a little crazy bastard, tough kid and is all fun. KISS will change everything, but I haven't described the plot well so here it goes: Wheeler and Danny are those mentioned good friends, they work as salesmen, they go to different schools and try to keep the youth away from drugs, ""drugs are bad, energy drinks are good"", certainly they sell a Red Bull-like drink. Danny's unhappy and after his girl leaves him he and Wheeler are arrested so is 30 days in jail or community service by taking care of Ronnie and Augie, of course they go for the community service.So basically when we see for the very first time Augie or better McLovin we laugh really hard and that's when the movie really starts. Certainly we know what we can expect with this nerdy teenager and that won't be an easy time for Danny, and on the other hand we have certainly the McLovin who with Wheeler must spend time, the mentioned crazy black kid who is like ""this mother f***** tried to grab on my hang-down"" just after he meet Wheeler, certainly as truly annoying for Wheeler as truly funny. But KISS will save Wheeler's day once Ronnie realizes about their existence, about their success with the chicks and stuff, so now Wheeler and Ronnie will be seeking for chicks and stuff, so now Wheeler is really a pal for crazy Ronnie.And on the other hand Danny will be fine with McLovin as well, Danny will know more about a world in which he has to make reverence to a sort of gay ""king"" (Ken Jeong) and has to act really well when he gets killed. Stuff happen, both McLovin and Ronnie are p*ssed off, their mothers are p*ssed off but in that is different since because McLovin's mother and stepfather get angry McLovin stops being angry with Danny but anyway we get the final battle and is a hilarious part, to begin because we have sort of the most bizarre Gene Simmons ever! To end, Role Models is just hilarious stuff, absolutely recommended!",Role Models
52,p-stepien,I hath laughed me head off!,8,15 March 2010,"Danny Donahue (Paul Rudd) and ancient labyrinth dweller cross-dressing Wheeler (Seann William Scott) earn money by riding around in a monster truck and paying visits to schools, where they pep talk about how drugs are bad. Instead they suggest the Minotaur power-drink. Apart from tasting great it can be a great party gimmick, when your pee turns green. Danny is frustrated with his dead-end crappy work. A feeling not shared by the dirty-mouthed chick-slaying Wheeler. A tenth year anniversary of working for Minotaur dawns on the hapless ultra-cynical Danny and instead of cheering he ends up being dumped by his girl Beth (Elizabeth Banks), who is just downright bored with his negativity. Downtrodden Danny ends up resisting arrest and driving into a school statue with his Minotaur monster truck with Wheeler as his unwilling accomplice. Willing to do anything to get out of jail free the mismatched duo are forced to do community service - looking after two kids (becoming their buddies). Naturally they get the crackiest cases - given the alternative of ending up in jail they have to make it or break it...Shockingly surprised at how sweet this movie was. Even more shocked that Wheeler and his little bud use so much profound language you would have to beep half the dialogue to make this movie PG. Fortunately no fart jokes - which is a welcome development for Seann William Scott (an immensely talented comedian being wasted on even more immensely stupid movies). Scott and Rudd are one of the best on-screen duos I have seen in ages and given the surprisingly subtle feel-good script this movie seems like an almost perfect success.It is far from perfect and not all the gimmicks and characters fell in tone with the general feel of the movie (i.e. Gayle Sweeney - the ex-crack addict den mother was a bit overboard for my taste). Also the nudity and sex seemed partly out of line. That said I haven't had such an honest and relatively intelligent laugh in a long while. I especially loved the absurd humour which is unusual for an American movie and sometimes you really have no idea what the joke actually was... it was just so out there that given you typical low-belt jokes in modern American movies you would not be to blame for mistaking the movie for a modern version of Monty Python.",Role Models

Here he's a selfish and bad humored adult.The movie is interesting until the time Danny argued with Augie's parents.

It went from a fringe, nerds-only oddity, to the subject of a few documentaries, to a large portion of a mainstream comedy. Craziness! As for a review of the actual movie, Role Models is a comedy that's a bit more palatable to female tastes than the average film of this kind. It has a positive core at the center of its amusing and slightly raunchy exterior. Paul Rudd is as funny as always, Sean William Scott does his usual thing, and Elizabeth Banks lends her beauty and potent appeal, but it's Jane Lynch who steals the spotlight in her short, but numerous scenes. It's nice to see that Arrested Development alums are still the funniest in the biz.Role Models isn't nearly as touching or heartfelt as many critics would have you believe, and I do feel like it could have been much funnier. But overall, it left me with a good impression after I finished watching it, and that makes it a success in my book.",Role Models
55,brando647,Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott = Great Role Models,7,7 April 2009,"While I had never seen any of David Wain's previous films, the star power was enough to catch my attention for this comedy. I'm quickly finding myself as a major fan of Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott has never let me down. Here we have a flick that brings the two together in a comedy that, while it isn't the best I've seen, still manages to keep me laughing. The story follows Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) as two representatives for an energy drink company who are placed into community service to avoid jail time. As punishment, the two are forced into a Big Brother style program and are each assigned a kid for a month.I found that I wasn't overly impressed with this movie when I first watched it but it's grown on me each time since. The jokes are hit-or-miss but most of them are good for a laugh. Paul Rudd continues to flaunt his awesome line delivery and improv skills, and Scott does an ample job keeping up. Of course, some of the film's funniest moments are courtesy of the younger stars, Bobb'e J. Thompson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Thompson is like a mini-Chris Rock, vulgar with great comedic timing. Mintz-Plasse plays up the same nerd angle he did in Greg Mottola's SUPERBAD though now with an obsession for LAIRE (a live-action sword/dungeons role-playing game).The movie is funny but it's doesn't quite live up to the comedic gems we've been receiving from Judd Apatow and his crew in recent years. Some of the jokes fall flat, others muster a chuckle, but some are spot on (especially Jane Lynch, who boosts the laughs as the ex-cokehead running the program) and I still get a kick out of the film's LAIRE finale. The performances were great and a stronger script could've amped this film up a couple levels; if I'm not mistaken, the production had a few hiccups and rewrites. All-in-all, the humor outweighs the dull enough to keep this movie entertaining and worth a viewing.",Role Models

KISS is, after all, role model for four generations of rock bands.Beth, Rock and Roll All Night, Love Gun, Detroit Rock City - sung or heard as source music; a KISS pinball machine, Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd talking about how no one likes KISS, not even Paul Stanley; Scott educating young Bobb'e J. Thompson about two Jews who wore makeup and sang songs about tapping women and became millionaires; the four principals dressing as KISS for the final medieval battle... Who wrote ROLE MODELS? Gene Simmons?! There's less KISS in the last KISS album.David Wain directs ROLE MODELS adequately, from a story written by Paul Rudd, Wain himself and a few others, about energy drink spokesman Danny (Rudd), who travels from school to school with his mascot Wheeler (Seann William Scott), who one day goes postal and is assigned community service along with his mascot.They end up at a mentoring school, run by demented Jane Lynch, Rudd taking on a nerdy teen with a craze for medieval role-playing (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, still McLovin), Scott assigned a young black kid with a big mouth (Bobb'e J. Thompson, a little keg of dynamite). Effectively teaming the alienated adult with the alienated kid and the outlaw adult with the outlaw kid.Elizabeth Banks is Rudd's ex-gf and lawyer, simply glowing like she's just been tapped by KISS.Plot follows Rudd and Scott as they arc toward becoming real mentors, rather than simply doing their time for the state.

58,oneguyrambling,Refreshingly good natured comedy. You just have to read beteween the lines.,6,28 December 2011,"Danny (Paul Rudd) has a bad day on the job and drags his loyal but dim-witted buddy Wheeler (Sean William Scott) down with him. Danny is a 'Red Bull' style energy drink spokesman, Wheeler is the guy in the bull suit that jumps around beside him. In the same 24 hours Danny loses his girlfriend, license and job.In reality he starts by losing the girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks), and his subsequent tantrum and stupidity sees him lose both license and job and sees him teetering on the verge of imprisonment. Somehow guilt by association sees Wheeler in the same predicament.To avoid jail Beth – who happens to be a lawyer = lucky – wrangles community service instead. Service in the form of helping disadvantaged and troubled kids for a company named 'Sturdy Wings'.This shakiest of premises: allowing unreliable young men to mentor impressionable young boys, sets the scene for the slap dash stuff that follows. Miraculously enough though the threadbare premise is held together by enough jokes and amusing moments to make the thing worthwhile, largely due to the continued comedic stylings of one Paul Rudd, and the strength of the various supporting bit parts on display throughout.When allotted their respective 'littles' (Danny and Wheeler are 'bigs') by Sturdy Wings boss and recovering alcoholic Sweeney (Jane Lynch) we immediately see where this is going.Danny considers himself 'normal', but in reality he is so concerned with not being deemed 'uncool' that his disdain for cliché and obvious statements leaves everyone else bored by his constant judgment. He scores 16ish Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a medieval-style role player who is intensely insecure when not in character, and intensely-intense when he is.Wheeler on the other hand wants no part of responsibility of any kind. He is more than happy being the jumping around sidekick in the costume and has no thought for his own future. For now he is all about the well let's just say boobies (and everything below). Of course he is allocated troubled young 8ish Ronnie, a profane little sh*t-stirrer who wants nothing more than to not have to deal with adults.Each kid has parental issues – but ones that don't kill the potential laughs – no abuse here, and the guys must get through to the children in their own way, and sucks; maybe learn a little about themselves on the way What develops is a rom-com with all the associated hijinks, temporary fall-outs and hitches, only between an adult male and a kid/youth, but that's not where the laughs are born.Role Models works best in the smaller roles, the now renowned Ken Jeong keeps his pants on this time and plays the King of the role playing game L.A.I.R.E., surrounded by his toadying minions and remaining in character even away from the game in his kingdom at the local cafe. Jane Lynch is a little OTT with the attempted mind games as the Sturdy Wings boss, but she also gets a few of the best lines in the flick, and there are numerous other bit roles – each with a couple jokes – filled by character actors that'll have you remembering them from other bit roles in other flicks.The jokes are thrown about quick and fast, and while some don't work enough do to make Role Models a lot like I Love You, Man and Knocked Up, lightweight and amusing enough to justify your time, with occasional genuine humour (and unexpected nudity!).Final Rating – 6 / 10. I can see the future. When I watched this 4 days ago I knew myself well enough that I wrote ""It really is a 6"" next to the rating.

Wheeler is just a screw up, I know we've all made mistakes. But Wheeler makes a lot. Both are very likable characters though. Director David Wain, who co-created the show Stella(a genius sitcom that had only ten episodes)returns with this film. I loved Role Models, and I definitely think you should see it. Back to the cast.

61,baumer,My whole body hurt from laughing so hard,10,25 November 2008,"I believe that every decade or so, a few films comes along that defines a generation. In the comedy genre as of late, the Apatow gang has been stealing all the headlines. Superbad will go down as this generations Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Maybe Knocked Up will be known as the neo-Annie Hall. Up until now I'm not really sure what would be known or compared to Beverly Hills Cop. That film is on a stage unto itself. Eddie Murphy did something that no one had done before him and he spawned a myriad imitations. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this, because although Role Models is not a ""cop movie"" it is a buddy movie with all the vulgarity and brash comedy as Beverly Hills Cop. Role Models will not make 200 million dollars the way Beverly Hills Cop did but it will be remembered for generations to come as one of the funniest films of the decade.I'll write a more detailed review of this later, but I had to come here and rebut all the negative comments in here about this film. This film had me laughing from the very first moment. Paul Rudd is simply hilarious and Jane Lynch could very well be a star after this film. She has all the best lines and her line about the judge and the kind of relationship they used to have is my choice for funniest line ever in the history of film.

63,jaredmobarak,Taste the beast  Role Models,7,8 March 2009,"I need to look into the plethora of comedies coming down the pipe for who wrote and directed them. I watched the trailer for Role Models and thought it looked funny enough. But it was Seann William Scottdon't get me wrong, he's pretty good, I just didn't have it high on my list, even though my boy Paul Rudd co-starred. So, here I was, months later and finally ready to take a peek, and the starting credits just made me excited for what was to follow. I had no idea that the crew behind ""The State"" were integral in the production, both writing and starring. Whether my memory of that show holds up to its actually enjoyment, I don't know, however, what they have been doing lately has been comic genius. Even in the more subtle collaborations like Diggers, the laughs were big and the comedy worthwhile. Thankfully, director David Wain and co-writer Ken Marino brought the star of that film over, Rudd, to help them once again. The guy is pure gold these days and even though this new film is pretty run-of-the-mill story-wise, the characters and antics are anything but.Two man-childs screw up on the job, (performing at school auditoriums to sell kids on an unhealthy energy drink to take the place of narcotics), by disrupting the peace, destroying property, and abusing a police officer. Rudd's Danny's girlfriend, who broke up with him just before the incident, is a lawyer and gets jail time reduced to community service for the Sturdy Wings organization, (got to admit I really like the logo for this made-up entity in the film). Danny and William Scott's Wheeler find themselves paired with the two toughest cases in the program: Augie Farks, a nerdy teen who entrenches himself in a live-action D&D world called LAIRE, and Ronnie Shields, a foul-mouthed grade schooler from a single mother home, acting out to push all those who try and reach him away. Assigned by Wings founder Gayle Sweeney, (the always memorable Jane Lynch in another gem of a role as an ex-drug addict prostitute who found her calling in ""servicing"" the children); they are set up to fail to be sent to the big house. While Wheeler begins to enjoy time with a child as crude as himself, Danny can't get out of his funk, a depression that continues to escalate, as he can't even bring himself to call his co-worker a friend  they just work together.The interactions with Augie and Ronnie, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson respectively), are definitely the high points of a very funny film. I hate to say that McLovin' will forever be typecast as the loser geekhis nasally voice and gawky features don't help the factbut, for now, it's working for him. Wearing a cape and fighting grown men in costumes who speak old English, Augie is both embarrassing and endearing, showing a side of us all, that need to be unique and different, to escape the monotony of our horrible lives, no matter what cost to our own public image. As for Thompson's Ronnie, you won't get anything funnier. This kid is fantastic: cussing, slapping people in the face without warning, and bringing out the cute when necessary. I don't know whether to condemn or condone the parents of this boy, because he's definitely got something, I'm just not sure if it is morally right to let him have it. Both boys, though, fit right into the craziness of the movie, bringing out the inevitable discovery of Danny and Wheeler's need to dismantle their selfish selves, and adding fodder for and the creation of multiple laugh-out-loud moments.Supporting this foursome team is a lot of familiar faces, many who have worked with each other before. Lynch is a staple in this genre and joining her are a couple guys that have been cropping up lately too. Both Ken Jeong, (as the King of LAIRE), and Joe Lo Truglio, (a fellow countryman of Augie's), add some awkward brilliance to that thread of the story. You may remember both from bit parts in Pineapple Express  someone needs to get the Apatow gang and ""The State"" gang together for a film. As for members of that troupe, Ken Marino and Kerri Kenney have fun as Augie's parents, director David Wain himself tries to play the acoustic guitar, and even ""UCB"" alum Matt Walsh comes to join in the fun. Let's also not forget the beautiful Elizabeth Banks as Danny's love. She may not be integral to the humor, but she is the rock that his character works towards, and thus becomes a reason for some of the insane activities that occur.Yes, the kooky kids and their inclusion in the sordid ways of two screw-up adults would be funny anywhere, but add in the medieval wars, the teaching of an eleven year old on how to disguise his cleavage viewing, and the cryptic words spewing from Jane Lynch's mouth each time she's on screen, (along with her prize volunteer weirdo A.D. Miles), and you can't lose. References to pop culture are infused throughout, adding a level of relevance as well. We have Kiss entering the land of LAIRE, Rudd quoting every romantic film his character has seen, a gut-busting joke at Harry Potter's expense, and even a mention of Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's own regular Marvin Hamlisch. Sure its obvious, sure its vulgar, (I did view the un-rated version), but there is enough heart and an abundance of quality laughs to make checking Role Models out a good move.",Role Models
64,jon.h.ochiai,"""Role Models"" really works",8,15 November 2008,"My buddy Darin asked me regarding Director David Wain's ""Role Models"", ""Why do you see movies like this?"" I had mentioned that ""Role Models"" is extremely predictable. You have Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott, as two guys forced into community service work as Big Brothers or else face jail time. Of course when they first meet up with their respective charges, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson, it is disastrous. Then for the remainder of the movie we are on edge wondering whether our selfish jerk heroes will transform into the paternal figures that were deep down inside. Okay, this is formulaicunquestionably. However, the screenplay by Rudd, Ken Marino, and Timothy Dowling is ridiculously offensive as illustrated by some of the four letter rifts by Thompson as little Ronnie, but oddly and startlingly ""Role Models"" is heartwarming in spite of itself. A lot of it has to do with the brilliance of Jane Lynch as Big Brother Program Leader Gayle Sweeney""Don't B.S. a bull sh**ter"", and the winning performances of Rudd and Scott In a wonderful scene, Rudd as Danny has dinner with Augie (Mintz-Plasse) and his Mother (Kerrie Kenney) and her boyfriend Jim (Ken Marino). It becomes transparent to Danny that Augie's family sucks. Augie is doing the best he can, and he is a good kid. Danny says, ""Augie You do what makes you happy!"" So amidst the cheap and crass jokes, which really do work, ""Role Models"" gets it right. Okay, I buy into the sentimental manipulation. Although I think Wain and crew often opt for the cheap laughs, they have their hearts in the right place: All kids ought to be happy. Who would have guessed that given the outrageous setup? Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott play Danny and Wheeler, who are sale reps for the energy drink Minotaur. They visit different high schools and campuses with Wheeler dressed in a Minotaur suit. Danny hates his job and pretty much his life. One day his beautiful attorney girlfriend Beth (funny and charming Elizabeth Banks) finally dumps Danny. After all, Beth had to endure Danny's ""My life sucks!"" every single day. Danny goes completely nonlinear with Wheeler literally along for the ride, and the two are arrested and face up to 6 months in jail. Beth works her magic with the judge, and commutes their sentence to 180 hours of community service for a local Big Brothers program headed by Gayle (hysterical Jane Lynch).During the orientation Danny confesses that he would rather serve his prison term. Wheeler is matched with Ronnie (Thompson), who is a little gangster. He says to Wheeler, ""I don't wanna take my pants off!"" Shocked Wheeler says, ""What?"" Danny is matched with geeky Augie (Mintz-Plasse), who wears a cape and wields a plastic sword. Augie is a fan of some live action ""Dungeons and Dragons"" culture. Granted Wain and the writers gave more insight into the nuances of this culture than I really needed to know. However, the point being that Augie is sweet on young Sarah, who is also a participant. This does not escape the eye of mentor Danny. Wheeler is a player, and sleeps with all the hot women. Of course this is a great influence on the impressionable Ronnie. Scott as Wheeler has a hilarious naked tryst with a Big Sister on a camping trip.""Role Models"" really works because of Rudd and Scott. Their polarizing styles compliment. Rudd as Danny is the more sarcastic understated smart ass with the big heart. Scott nails the goofy party animal, who deep down really cares. To both their credits the transformation of their characters from selfish jerks to compassionate parents is nearly ridiculous, gratifying, and endearing. We can all kind of figure out how ""Role Models"" will work itself out, and Rudd, Scott, and Wain make it at least worth the wait.",Role Models

67,Mr_Sensitive,"Two Kids, Two Nude Scenes, Calculate Your Maths.",3,1 April 2009,"Tell the truth I’m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie. And after having seen it, I was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie.I’m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid’s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. I’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.Synopsis: The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven’t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin’) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. And the acting is so-so as expected when you’re watching this type of movie. And the direction, what do one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. Can’t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes.Cons: Not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together.Rating: 3.5/10 (Grade: F)",Role Models
68,LoneWolfAndCub,"Not the best in the crop of recent, similar comedies, but still very funny",7,18 January 2009,"In the past few years there have been a large amount of crass, but incredibly funny, comedies. A few notable ones include: The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder. This is much the same as those, and almost as good. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are the two leads this time, and they are incredibly funny together, whilst Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse, newcomer Bobb'e J. Thompson, the very funny and beautiful Elizabeth Banks and the quirky Jane Lynch provide excellent support. David Wain's direction was smooth and the soundtrack was great, however, the film's major downfall was the screenplay. Unfortunately, it falls into cliché often, and the ending suffers from the ""typical Hollywood business"" of everything being wrapped up neatly.However, despite that one negative, Role Models manages to be hilarious for the most part, with some excellent one-liners thrown around by Scott and Rudd. Of course, the humour is not exactly witty or intelligent, but that does not matter in a film like this (where nudity and swearing are commonplace). Laughs come in many forms, from toilet and sex jokes, to some outrageously funny scenes of Role Playing battles. Role Models is something to sit back and enjoy casually, as it provides some great laughs, with a touching message and a great cast of comic actors. I am looking forward to seeing the next comedy of this type, and hope to see all these actors together again!3½/5",Role Models

A casual comedy fan looking for some guys' fun shouldn't have to sit through so much footage of that, and one certainly must ask the question whether this targets the young 25-30 year old adult or the much younger prepubescent audience because those two are not the same.4.5/10.",Role Models

71,richieandsam,A good comedy that will have you laughing.,7,22 July 2013,"ROLE MODELSThis film is a good comedy.It is about 2 energy drink representatives who get into trouble by crashing their company car into a statue. They were due to go to jail, but their lawyer arranged for them to do community service instead. Their community service was looking after troubled children.Sounds annoying and not very original right? Well, you are kind of right. The story has been re-hashed a million times over. There are so many films out there where an irresponsible adult has to take care of a kid. And yes, the children are annoying. But the good thing is, they are not annoying because they can't act like in most movies with kids. These kids can act and they do a great job. They are annoying because they are playing annoying kids. I don't know... maybe they were just being themselves. :)The movie stars Seann William Scott & Paul Rudd. They both do a good job, but Seann is as annoying in this as he is in everything else he makes. I always find him a little over the top, but he has made some good movie choices as the roles he gets are the over the top characters. The 2 main kids in this film were Christopher Mintz-Plasse & Bobb'e J. Thompson. Bobb'e was really good... I don't know why, but I still find it weird to hear a young child use bad language. He reminds me of a very young Eddie Murphy... back when Eddie Murphy was funny before he became all family friendly.There were some really outrageous lines that really made me laugh out loud. One of my favourites was said by the lady running the child care place, she said ""I'm not here to service you, I'm here to service these young boys."". I am not even joking... I nearly spat out my drink with laughter. :)All in all the story runs along nicely, it is entertaining and the casting was quite good. The writing was even really well done.

72,willcundallreview,A funny film with an interesting story,7,24 February 2014,"Rating-7/10Role Models is a funny comedy and well acted by a funny cast which mixes humour and a heart warming backing to create what I think is an underrated film. A solid kind of good film this is worth a watch and with laughter to match you whilst watching then it is even more advisable. Here below is why I think this film is a good one.The story as said is funny yet warm and although is mostly humour of which can be sometimes very crude(mostly from Seann William Scott), it is still warm also and the ending as you may see is really quite happy and tender. It is fast comedy and things start straight away as you will see, the story is very simple but it works well enough anyway and you should laugh if at least not once, just go with the flow and have fun is all you need to like it, trust me it can be good.Paul Rudd in his ever comedic role is good in the main role with previously mentioned William Scott providing comedic cover in the supporting if not not shared main role. I particularly found the young actor Bobb'e J. Thompson who plays an orphan child as very funny and plays a cursing young boy who acts like he is 30 years old and a player. Elizabeth Banks brings rationality to the film and is just about the only serious character but she doesn't do anything to ruin the humour, it works along well.The script is the main part of the good humour used in this and is partly written by Paul Rudd as well as some others who contribute and make the script possibly the best thing about this entire film. One point when the directing of David Wain comes in is when they play this pretend fight game and the entire shot must have been very difficult to direct as so much goes on, the scene itself is hilarious by the way, and+ the scene has some great costumes as does many parts of the film so look out for them.It isn't the most solid comedy and not every joke is funny to be fair, most are I think but when they are not funny they are sometime in between funny jokes and so you laugh and then think ""what was that"" in two seconds. The acting isn't awesome and although Paul Rudd is experienced at this with such showings in Anchorman, he is the best comedic performer by far, William Scott is funny too though.I think most people who enjoy slightly crude humour will enjoy this and some people will have big laughs. If you are looking for a way more sophisticated comedy then this isn't for you but the movie isn't all comedy as I said it has a warm hearted feeling running through it and by the end(you will see what I mean),you feel the comedy has worked well and it end's nicely.So overall a 7/10 from me a solidly good film and a comedy I couldn't tell you to watch more actually. I would say if you just watch this through and in comedy mode if that makes any sense, then you will laugh at this and find the script is very smartly done. Some will like, some will not and I expect a rather mixed review on this.",Role Models

At first when I saw that Paul Rudd was in it I thought that it was another Apatow movie, but I was wrong when I read who produced it. This movie really delivered huge laughs and the audience seemed to enjoy it along with myself.

76,diac228,Rauchingly sweet,9,19 March 2009,"For every twenty filthy disgusting R-rated comedy gems, there's one that stands out because of its heavy dosage of heart. Role Models isn't the sort of movie you'd expect to be the exception, but nonetheless delivers quality film-making, quality writing and acting, and plenty of life-lessons as well as raunchy humor to keep you laughing throughout. Paul Rudd's first script is full of his dry, sarcastic, witty brand of humor; and then we have the hilarious Seann William Scott in the sidekick role. Underneath the layers of profanity, sex jokes, cleavage lies life values and a hidden layer of sentimentality that seeps its way through the second and third acts. The transition is very slow and gradually actually improves the film as it rolls on.Role Models follows two slackers, a bitter one (Rudd) and a rowdy, horny freebird (William Scott) being forced to community service after a mishap outside a school. For their community service, they have to enroll in a big brother-like program and take care of a kid for 150 hours. The task becomes hard because one of them is a major fan of the fantasy, medieval role-playing lifestyle, and the other is a foul-mouthed, misbehaving youngling with no respect towards adults or people in general. As they spend more time together however, they realize they have a lot more in common than previously assumed; and suddenly start changing each other's habits for the better.The screenplay is helmed by four minds, with Paul Rudd providing his personal touch for the first time in his career. The payoff is magnificent, as the plot never dwells into formulaic, and most of the humor hits rather than misses. Unlike most modern rated-R comedies, some of the jokes are very low and come quickly, therefore passing by the viewer without getting a reaction. It takes some quick wit to nab the swiftly-delivered one-liners. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast as the lead character Danny, and performs with an overwhelming aura of selfishness, sarcasm, and subtle hostility. Seann William Scott is at his best when being second banana (See: American Pie, The Rundown) and is also perfectly cast as the wild, immature co-worker of Danny. Last but not least we must applaud Christopher Mintz-Plasse as he delivers another grand geeky performance that mixes humor with heart.What separates incredible rated-R comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and There's Something About Mary from stinkers like Scary Movie 2, Superbad, and My Best Friend's Girl is how much raunchy material is presented and its timing. In the first two films mentioned, there's squeamish and adult humor sprinkled throughout, but it's never overdone or overkilled. Role Models has a lot of profanity, a bit of sex, and a bit of crudeness attached; but these elements are never one-hundred percent focused on. Director David Wain knows how to keep the film from being unbearably crude and unwatchable by proving other ways to deliver laughs: whether it is with physical humor, snappy comebacks, and hilarious scenarios. The best bits are when Danny and Wheeler are having trouble adjusting to the behaviors of their ""little brothers.""But then the movie dwells into deeper territory by providing insight into the reason why the little brothers are such a hassle to handle; and why these kids can potentially help our two main characters. Themes about life, love, family, and understanding the next individual are all too present. Nobody's bizarre and unique mannerisms are ever left unexplained. By the end you've gotten to know the characters so well, you can figure out their next moves. It's a sort of predictability that's actually refreshing. Of course, then we are all thrown off by the climax, which stages one of the funniest moments in 2008 cinema. The epic finale is long, but ludicrous, and wraps up the story very nicely.Bottom Line: It usually isn't my nature to give a film with dozens of cleavage jokes a high score (especially with my hate affair with Dane Cook), but Role Models is surprisingly cute, surprisingly sweet, and delightfully hilarious and touching. You'll care for everyone by the third act, and will remain entertained until the very end. Unlike the average adult comedy, this one comes with a lot of values and adorable little moments that makes this worth watching more than once. Paul Rudd is a much underrated actor and entertainer, as we see him deliver on his first main comedic role. Here's to hoping we'll see much more of him in the near future. In the meantime, you'll do yourself some good by watching this gem.""No, venti is twenty. Large is large. In fact, tall is large and grande is Spanish for large. Venti is the only one that doesn't mean large. It's also the only one that's Italian. Congratulations, you're stupid in three languages.""",Role Models
77,dvc5159,Very funny stuff.,6,2 March 2009,"This movie surprised me a lot. It is full of well-timed and crafted jokes. Unusual in a time where jokes are mostly stale and repetitive. Not in here. But the show truly belong to the the two leads, Scott and Rudd.Rudd plays a depressed energy drink salesman and Scott plays his sex-crazed dimwit companion, their most memorable and enjoyable characters to date. Their dialog and on-screen chemistry is superb and makes their characters more likable. Their interactions with the kids; one a foul mouthed 8 year old, the other an obsessed role-player of a D&D-like game, is also spot-on.What makes the films and jokes work - it has heart. Sure, it's R-rated and raunchy, but at the same time it is honest, and not played for cheap laughs. The screenplay (co-written by Rudd) is terrific. A notable mention goes to a scene involving a ""fake"" Lord of the Rings like battle, complete with dramatic score. It's so ridiculous and funny it actually looks pretty fun to do once in a while.So, sit back, relax, and have a hearty laughs with your pals. What better way to sit out the current depression than with comedies! Here in Malaysia, the cinemas are prone to heavy censorship (cutting out language, violence, sex, etc) so the film's content will be safe, but a sharp decrease in quality is expected. My advise - if you're in the US, watch this in cinemas where it rightfully deserves to be, or get the DVD.I see a great future for Rudd.Overall rating: 8/10",Role Models

Jane Lynch, playing the social worker is another one of that clique ,including Seth Rogen, Michael Cera and Jonah Hill , who are just one trick ponies and should be shown the exit. Basically her schtick is boring already as well. This film had lousy direction, lousy content and lousy judgment , as far as tastelessness in the midst of child actors.

It's OK, nothing really wrong with it, but, there's more fun to be had with this setup.Most jokes in the movie seem to come from sexual allusions.

81,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Very sweet and kind hearted. Rudd's first lead role should've been given more to work with.,7,6 November 2008,"Finally! One of the best comedic actors in the business, Paul Rudd, finally gets his own R-rated vehicle to toy with. Too bad whoever directed this movie didn't let him toy with the movie that much. Rudd may have done re-writes on the film, but his hilarious improv and ability to expand his character on his own are what really makes him one of the best comedic actors around. While that may be the film's greatest weakness, it doesn't change the fact that Role Models is a 'role model' of a comedy, which makes you both laugh and feel good inside.While I sort of expected more from Rudd in terms of sheer laughter, he does bring a lot to the table as a leading man, and it works in that respect. He definitely has the dramatic chops to handle a role with as much deadpan humor as his Danny does, and that makes the character work and justifying it for not being as hilarious as his previous ones (Anchorman, 40 Year Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sean William Scott is forgettable and an odd presence in the movie. He doesn't bring anything new to the table and basically is there to make the movie R-rated. Not a lot of character development here.As for the supporting cast, I loved them all. They made the movie for me. Is it just me, or is Elizabeth Banks in EVERY movie I see in theaters? It's good to see her popularity growing, because despite little screen time and development, she again succeeds in being likable and gorgeous. I never get tired of seeing her. Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse steals the show again as a character similar to his previous stellar performance in Superbad, but there's plenty of differences for me to laud him all over again. He's just plain likable, and with his full blown geeky role here (think of him as a conglomerate of Michael Cera's usual schtick and every geek you've ever seen in movies), he does a great job. In one scene where he 'blows up', I couldn't help but notice how he could be funny one second, and literally moments later pull of the seriousness required in the scene.Of course, then there's the King of Child Comedic Acting (if that's not a title already held, I'm giving it to him now), Bobb'e J. Thompson, who had me on the floor laughing. It's not just a cursing kid talking about boobs all the time. His delivery and unwavering cuteness really bring the crowd to life. Ken Jeong and Joe Lo Truglio were hilarious in minor roles, and Jane Lynch got annoying in her second or third scene. Very awkward.Like I've said, Role Models is very sweet and kind hearted, but it's missing that 'something' that made other movies like it successful. Maybe it's one lead actor (Rudd) not being able to fully work with his material (maybe it wasn't good enough), or maybe little to no comedic chemistry between the leads (mostly due to Scott's inability to be funny) had something to do with it. To put it simple, when it's just Rudd and Scott on screen, the best it's going to get is a minor chuckle or two.

83,Mr_Censored,"Not a perfect ""Role Model,"" but good enough for all ages.",7,24 April 2009,"Paul Rudd (""The Forty Year-Old Virgin"") and Seann William Scott (""American Pie"") are cast as Danny and Wheeler, a pair of buddies who carve a living by selling an energy drink they despise, dressing in bizarre costumes, driving an even crazier ""Monster"" truck and giving speeches/pitches to high school kids. When Danny hits rock bottom, his girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) moves out on him, and a gig gone wrong lands them community service that forces them to spend time with a shy nerd and a loud-mouth pain-in-the-neck. After reluctantly relating to the kids, Danny learns to work out his own issues and Wheeler learns a little responsibility. Like any mentor/student comedy, you know where this is heading.While the film has a filthy mind, is heart is in the right place. Clichés are abundant, and the plot moves from point A to B almost too easily, but solid performances from Sean William Scott, Elizabeth Banks, Christopher Mintz Plasse (McLovin of ""Superbad"") and a gut-bustingly funny, show-stealing Bobb'e J. Thompson help elevate the material. In fact, it is the show's star, Paul Rudd, who looks and acts like he isn't having any fun. Ironic, then, that he wrote the material himself, but his turn in this film is just a little close to the apathy that defines his character. As for the humor, it may be a bit much for younger audiences (nudity, as well) but nothing a mature pre-teen couldn't handle. It treads on very thin ice, being that it's a film about kids that potentially appeals to kids, but filled to the brim with adult humor. It's almost sunk by this – almost – but thankfully, it never gets too tasteless. All around, it's a feel-good, no-brainer flick that will inspire a few hearty chuckles. Judd Apatow material it wants to be, surely it is not, but entertaining and charming all the same.",Role Models
84,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,Funny and entertaining,7,12 February 2009,"Just went with some friends to see this and it was funny and at times heartwarming. I laughed but found my self checking my watch towards the end with all the Dungeons and Dragons and LAIRE material.The acting was good. Even though it doesn't really have to be in a comedy. Jane Lynch stole the entire show. She stole every scene she was in. Bobb'e J. Thompson was great as a foul mouth kid and Mclovin makes a very welcome to the screen.I didn't think this was as funny as other comedies that have came out in the last few years like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up or 40 Year old Virgin. But Role Models is still funny in its own way. It was raunchy and crude. During the last 10 minutes i felt like i was watching a Lord of the Rings spoof or Revenge of the Nerds in Middle Earth. That didn't fell like it belonged in a movie that is meant to be a crude adult comedy.However despite the negatives Role Models was still funny and was worth seeing. All involved were funny and i recommend it. It is definitely a movie to see with some friends. I give Role Models...7/10",Role Models

In fact, at times ""Role Models"" was very funny, especially any scene that featured magnificent super geek Christopher Mintz-Plasse, vile child Bobb'e J.

True, you could argue that Paul Rudd's character (disillusioned, cynical, loser) might have been better played by someone like Vince Vaughan, and you could also argue that Seann William Scott's character (cocksure, man child, loser) was exactly the same character that he had played in, well, practically every single other film he has been in, but that would be picking hairs.""Role Models"" is a straight, down the line comedy. Often rude, frequently relying on bad language in the absence of solid jokes, and fairly crass, but weirdly feel good.

Funny from Beginning to End !,10,3 December 2008,"For people who enjoy raucous and ribald humor, without being gross or uber juvenilistic like ""Super Bad"", ""Role Models"" delivers on many levels.Wheeler/Anson(Seann William Scott) and Danny Donahue(Paul Rudd) are buddies who work together as a two-man sales force for Minotaur Energy Drink. Wheeler is the mascot, with Danny the pitchman who go around to elementary and high schools, peddling this junk as an alternative to taking illegal drugs. Danny,after ten years with the company wants a better life and is extremely dissatisfied with his current situation. Wheeler is the easy going, take it as it comes B personality.Beth(Elizabeth Banks) wants out as Danny's lawyer girlfriend.So as Danny's personal crisis grows, he loses control when his Minotaur vehicle is about to be towed away.As an alternate punishment to jail, Wheeler and Danny are sentenced to 150 hours of community service. This is where the skill of Director David Wain shines, as he blends the crude rumor, with 10 year olds Augie Farks(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Ronnie Shields(Bobb'e J. Thompson), and a maladjusted reformed sex-drug addict Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch), who is the proprietor of ""Sturdy Wings"", a juvenile reform center.What a FANTASTIC cast, Rudd's dead pan sarcasm and Scott's easy going manner, are a perfectly blended chemistry, that plays to the Max !If you aren't offended by some offensive language, that is said for shock value, and ALLOT of laughs,then this film is for you !There is some nudity, but boobs don't offend most people.Terrific script and exceptional direction carry this film over the top with laughter and sentimentality, when the main characters, must strive to help the children who have bonded to them, and help themselves to strive to be more in life.This film is a PERFECT 10, for those who are not offended by some crude language, and some sexual situations. Terrific Script !This film was not properly marketed, just look at the poster doesn't tell the real story.

88,mr_popcorn,"Wassup, Reindeer Games?",7,23 November 2008,"Role Models, while not really something out a genius mind, is both hilarious and touching. A kind of warm hearted comedy that hits you straight in the heart sans the toilet humor and green jokes and delivers the life important message of doing something that makes you happy. Paul Rudd who is slowly stepping out behind Steve Carell and Seth Rogen establishes himself as a deadpan comedian and proves that he can be an effective lead. Seann William Scott on the other hand, shows the audience that he's not the same Stifler we all knew him to be as he takes on a role albeit similar to Stifler but different in context. It may be just be me, but I think that's a stepping stone in his acting career.Surprise performances from kid wonder Bobb'e J Thompson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse aka McLovin, add a couple of estrogen power with Jane Lynch and Elizabeth Banks and you get a well picked cast and the hilarity will follow. A couple of little mistakes I noticed is at some point throughout the movie, it just can't help but be a little bit cheesy and towards the ending, it got a little too cute for my taste and I think the movie could have ended on a better foot.

Sean William Scott has been typecast as a ""garbage mouth"" and it's not fair to him. This would have been a perfect warm, comedy for everyone had it not been ""trashed"" with vulgarity, crudity and profanity. Is it really necessary? To see a 10 year-old spouting off about his penis and spewing the F-word profusely disgusted me. Even the women play it crude. Is this supposed to be cute? Well, it's not! This movie had a wonderful message for both adults and kids. I ask you; would you take your grandmother, your mother and/or a bunch of school kids to see this movie? Seriously, would you? I grew up in a different era where one didn't have use a foul mouth to get laughs, an era where we didn't think constantly, and only, about fornicating. I can enjoy films with a touch of profanity, and even a degree of crudeness but really there ARE other things in life! Role Models was based on a terrific idea, or concept that worked wonderfully; Community Service that started out on a bumpy road, but in the end rewarded all parties involved. Why ruin a great idea with an overdose of crude, rude behavior. Director David Wain, you screwed up! Kudos to Paul Rudd, Seann William Scott, Christopher Mitz-Plasse, Jane Lynch and Elizabeth Banks.

This film actually believes it.,9,8 November 2008,"Role Models - Two energy drink spokesmen, Wheeler and Danny (Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd) get in trouble with the law after Danny has a break-up with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks who is in everything these days). They are given the choice of jail or community service with troubled kids, and choose the latter. Danny is given a boy Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad) who wears a cape and is into role-playing games. Wheeler is given a foul mouthed terror of a boy (Bobb'e J. Thompson).Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott have good chemistry. Rudd has dry sarcasm to spare and Scott plays a sex-addled numbskull. Their interactions with the two talented young boys are funny and occasionally sweet. Bobb'e J. Thompson is one of the better child actors of his age and makes the nightmare of every teacher a cool often wickedly funny little character. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or ""McLovin'"" as he's known throughout America, plays essentially the same character but sweeter and shy and, funny enough, less creepy. So yeah, he's pretty firmly typecast as ""dork"" at this point. But he's a very palatable dork and may help raise the image of dorks everywhere above the status of subhuman. I heard many girls in the audience very sensitive to his plight in the audience.A few parts of the plot are contrived. But aside from a few film snobs, who goes to see a comedy for its original plot? The important thing is the laughs, and this is where the film delivers. Directed by David Wain, maker of The Ten (funny cult film), and written by Wain and Paul Rudd, this film is hilarious. The laughs were frequent and hearty. One of the films defining elements is the showcasing of role-playing games such as Dungeons&Dragons (here it is known as L.A.I.R.E). Role Models takes a surprisingly even handed look at it. It pokes fun, of course (so easy). But there is also respect ingrained. The result is a case of ""so lame it's awesome"" where the absurdity of D&D is given the gravitas of your average Hollywood blockbuster. It's hilarious, and does look terribly fun.And it's here that the film makes it's stand. Do what makes you happy, no matter what your parents or anyone else tells you. It's been said in so many films that the message seems false at this point. But in Role Model's extreme example of people doing what makes them happy, it really does ring true. You got to give a bunch of people playing with foam swords in the forest their due. They're doing what makes them happy. Can you say the same for yourself? I can't right now.This was a delightful film. It may be a bad year for movies, but it's a damn fine one for comedy. A-",Role Models

The trobulesome aspect is that there are so many child actors in the film which they can't even see. The most troublesome is the filth coming out of the mouth of a young boy. Where is parents on the set? Why would they let their young son use such language? Hope they were paid a lot of money.

When I got home I hopped on the Internet and found out that Maryland has America's oldest LARP-type organization!

That description sounds like a smarmy physical comedy derivative with cheap scatological bits. Except that Xfinity gave it a rating of 3 out of 4 stars, so I decided to take a look at it.To my pleasure, the film turned out to be a much more sophisticated movie. The two men, who are allowed to do community service instead of jail, are assigned to a big brother type program. The more intellectual of the two men, Danny, who is disillusioned with the world, is assigned to an immature teen who doesn't fit in with his peers; instead he devotes himself to participation in an on-going Dungeons and Dragons type reenactment played by a mixed group of adults and children who and his job. Wheeler, a care-free womanizer, is assigned a tough young foul-mouthed kid with whom no previous volunteer had lasted more than one day.

The movie isn't based on it's story or acting it was all about the laughs and the young kids swearing was hilarious. It doesn't seem good to have young kids swearing in movies but it really makes you laugh more than you would think. It was pretty Corny in many different scenes and a lot toward the end it kind of got a little bit strange. It did all come together and make the movie have a little bit of heart. For the whole first half of the movie everyone was selfish. It takes a lot for the kids and adults to find their the good side in them.

We may have all forgotten that Stifler was, for lack of a better term, the villain of American Pie. He was a dick we loved to hate, not someone we actually wanted to see succeed. Unfortunately, ever since Pie 2, we've seen the same character painted with the same brush, yet we're supposed to sympathize with him despite his obvious douchiness.Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is very likable in the cynic role. Jane Lynch has a funny supporting role. The kids themselves, including McLovin, are well played and easy to like.

99,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,If only this could have been the Role Model of all comedies...,6,3 July 2009,"Last night, I sat and watched Role Models with prior anticipation that this was going to be a crude and vilely humorous movie. Well, it had its moments, but kids were involved in the movie. So it seems to me the movie was forcibly toned down on the potential adult extremities of humor while having to maintain an R rating in this comedy. There is still potty mouthing, and sexual content/humor in this and it still pulls off as a funny movie (barely).Initially Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott propelled the humor at the beginning of the film, while endorsing their energy drink to junior high schools. While it wasn't over the top funny as I wanted it to be, there were some decent comedic moments. The chemistry between Rudd and Scott are good as the Role Models. Rudd is narrowly convincing to be an a-hole and Scott, well he's still ""Stifler"" all grown up. There was nothing too special about their characters. As for the kids they are supposed to be mentoring, Bobb'e J. Thompson was lovably menacing vile mouthing kid, but his screen time dwindled as the movie shifts its focus onto Christopher Mintz-Plasse's character. Though ""McLovin"" practically stole the show later on, I must admit it was actually pretty neat to watch a live action RPG in the end. Comedies typically have happy endings and Role Models was certainly no exception. It did its best to stray from the mainstream as far as endings go.I couldn't pick Role Models apart overall. I had some laughs but it wasn't the funniest movie I've seen. I still recommend the movie for the sake of watching the goofy live action RPG in the end.

102,fathersonholygore,One of the best comedies in recent years! (Spoilers ahead),10,27 April 2013,"I don't know exactly why this film didn't get big attention, but it's one of the better comedies I've seen over the past decade or more. Maybe it's because this was just before Paul Rudd really became a bigger name, and Sean William Scott is not considered to be a big leading man (although when he has the right script, he is absolutely gold), but either way Role Models deserves attention.In a situation you'd expect from any regular family-type comedy, Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott play two guys stuck at a dead end job working for an energy drink company called Minotaur; they spend their days driving around in a truck with minotaur horns on it, hawking energy drinks to kids at schools, and promote drug free lifestyles. One day, Rudd's character goes off the wall, and gets the two of them sentenced to 150 hours (maybe the number is wrong, doesn't matter) of community service at a group called Sturdy Wings run by the always charismatic and riotously funny Jane Lynch, a former alcoholic and drug addict. There, they are paired with two polar opposite children in Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the LARP (renamed here to LAIRE) playing boy and Bobb'e J. Thompson, a young boy with a monster of a foul mouth. A typical type of comedy situation, but the writing is absolutely golden. Right from the argument Rudd has with a barista at a Starbucks type location where he argues that 'venti' does not equal a large coffee (clearly his character is unaware it refers to actual quantity, and not a labelled size), I was hooked on the witty dialogue. Jane Lynch's character is absolute comedic gold every time she is on the screen; her vicious problem with semantics makes me cry laughing. Every character gets their time to shine; even minor players in the film such as Ken Marino, Ken Jeong, A.D Miles & Joe Lo Truglio all have some moments that are side splitting funny. Mintz-Plasse at one point tells Rudd he should let his girlfriend know he misses her 'whispering eye', and he does; this only make the young kid crack up, as Rudd is completely unaware of the medieval meaning behind the term, which Mintz-Plasse's character is very, very aware of. There is so much to like about this film. Sean William Scott and Bobb'e J. Thompson work really well together. Scott's character has a particular obsession with Kiss, and it creates a few really enjoyable moments, as well as lends a hand to the heartwarming conclusion of the whole movie. All in all, one of the best comedies I've seen, and certainly among the best of what I find to be a lot of lukewarm to mild comedies over the past decade or so. A comedy does not have to be raunchy to be funny, but every so often a film comes along that uses it appropriately, and edges around the line of what is or isn't too much; Role Models is one of those films. Small jokes involving Paul McCartney & Wings, or the Burger Hole make it not only loud-out-loud funny, but also sort of quirky. I can't recommend it highly enough to those who are fans of Paul Rudd, as well as people who enjoy a rambunctious Jane Lynch at her best. In fact, any of the actors on this bill worth nothing are on fire in Role Models, and I watch this comedy about 5 or 6 times a year, maybe more, so it has a lot of value as something you can re-watch from time to tome; for me at least. 10 out of 10 stars.",Role Models
103,michael-3204,Great cast does great work,7,28 December 2015,"""Role Models"" is from a time long ago in a galaxy far away where Seann William Scott had equal billing and stature with Paul Rudd and both could be ably supported by lesser knowns like Elizabeth Banks, Jane Lynch, and Ken Jeong (in short, well before ""Ant-Man,"" ""Pitch Perfect,"" ""Glee,"" and ""The Hangover""). The best feature of this amiable comedy is the cast, who spin silver if not gold from a formulaic story, pour on the charm without getting smarmy about it, and inject just the right amount of cynicism that keeps the humor sharp without being unnecessarily mean. This movie skillfully sails right over the many pits into which it could have fallen. The set- pieces sometimes seem a little random and meandering, but none of it is boring. Scott (who, I confess, I've always thought is an underrated comedic actor who never got the break he deserved) and Rudd (whose skills are more widely recognized) pair nicely together and pull off the ""friends-but-not-really"" dynamic extremely well. Their relationship is perhaps the most unique thing here -- it's a buddy comedy featuring two guys who are barely buddies, don't have much in common, yet have developed a long-standing mutual tolerance for each other's foibles. That's not an easy dynamic to convey in a lighthearted, lightly raunchy comedy that also has to pack in sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll, which it does seamlessly.

105,nathanschubach,"Typical tale of losers making it in the end, saved by a song",6,24 March 2012,"After watching numerous Paul Rudd movies just like this one, I attempted watching this recently, and I think it still holds up. Rudd and Seann William Scott play a fairly likable buddy-combo (even though I'm not a big fan of Scott's simply because he comes across as the same smug party-boy in everything since his role in American Pie, but as an actor for this role, I guess he did alright). The two boys that Rudd and Scott are assigned to mentor were the selling point on this movie: Christopher Mintz-Plasse (aka ""SuperBad's"" McLovin) and Bobb'e J. Thompson (aka the sass-talking, sailor-mouth kid). The moments spent with these kids is different from past comedies that try to sell the ""Odd Couple"" mismatch awkwardness between its characters, primarily when it comes to acting more like adults with these kids (taking them to parties, talking about ""Whispering Eyes"" and all that).There's a KISS-connection throughout the whole movie that is quite puzzling. Sure, KISS makes fairly adequate hard rock music that drives the soundtrack through these characters' days, but it plays such a huge roll here for no reason, and the script relies on their existence for character conversations and setups. It's very similar to Rudd's movie ""I Love You Man,"" except replace KISS with Rush. Maybe the writing wasn't all there for me, but the characters make the movie work pretty well, especially in the unrated version (where they were allowed to riff a little longer in scenes).Most of the comedy was physical in nature, coupled with ""did-he-just-say-that?"" moments. I liked seeing so many actors from the defunct sketch-comedy troupe The State in the movie;, Joe Lo Truglio especially played an excellent role as a LAIRE medieval swordsman.It's another of these feel-good comedies in the end, but the stakes are so low that you really don't care what happens to the characters. Scott, for me, felt out of place in this venture, and I've seen Rudd in so many of these same character roles that it makes me wonder if I should see him in any more. He basically was the same character for ""I Love You Man."" I still think the movie is better than any average comedy that tries to make this scenario work, but it is growing stale. 6 Stars.",Role Models

109,Len9876,"A comedy with potential, but it just doesn't quite make it.",6,24 November 2008,"This film is about two screwed-up guys, who are court-ordered to work with hardcore misfit kids, and they try to use the blind-leading-the- blind approach to turn the kids' lives around for the better. Mid-way through the film, the guys have some success. Then, towards the end of the film, they screw-up again. At the film's finale, will the guys succeed?Danny and Wheeler are the two guys that promote a high-energy drink with a rather moronic name. At the same time, they educate school kids about the pratfalls of drugs. Danny, a rather dull guy, claims to be unhappy with his life. During his time of unhappiness, he gets Danny in trouble. That brings the guys to Sturdy Wings, a kind of big brother/big sister program, in which the Wings do not seem to be too steady. The Wings would rather fly than stay with the program. There is a kid caught up in an adolescent type of medieval role play, and the other kid is just plain crude. To say the least, the guys do not seem to be a good match to deal with kids.There are some good laughs, in the midst of all the crudeness, but the film could have been a lot of funnier. And, it could have been poignant--but, somehow, the Wings never get sturdy enough to get off the ground. The actors and the film miss their mark.There is some deadpan, and a reminder of ""American Pie"". But, it's the supporting cast that really deliver (Jane Lynch and some actors from the Apatow realm). The jokes about breasts, and drawings of the genitalia, are inappropriate for a film about rehabilitating kids. Although they might fit in ""American Pie"", they don't belong in ""Role Models"". And, besides, such gimmicks just don't provide comic relief.""Role Models"" and Sturdy Wings do not get me positively anywhere, and leave me in suspended animation.

I don't recall hearing about it when it came out a couple years ago but, wow, did I miss out! This movie is HILARIOUS! Edgy in that you don't expect kids to be offering the kind of adult humor they do in this film, especially like what's offered up by Tracy Morgan's son. (Wow, the vulgarity!) But for some reason this movie pulls it off, even as you shift in your seat a little wondering what kind of parents would allow their kid to use that kind of language even for a movie, lol. Even beyond the humor, the more serious overtones or messaging in the plot is welcomed and somehow fits, as in Augie's character coming into his own and being validated in his uniqueness, showing much more maturity than expected. Love it! Love what the writers did with that plot line.So quirky and weird and yet so relatable is this movie. You go from looking ""at"" grown men play-fighting like soldiers in a war to rooting for them and entering into that wacky world right alongside them. lol The subplots and the superb supporting cast round out the film and make it one of the most pleasant movie-watching surprises I've encountered in a long time.7.5",Role Models

The characters were likable despite their obvious flaws (Danny - Paul Rudd - was a selfish jerk, Wheeler - Sean William Scott - was very reminiscent of Joey from Friends but more graphic). The acting was great, especially from the two kids, who were hilarious and adorable (in both senses of the word) all at once. And Paul Rudd was smokin'.

118,TheXeroXone,Wow this was an unfunny movie,4,20 April 2009,"I think the only reason people could say this film was entertaining was because of the way the larpers act. If you have no idea how larpers act during a live action role playing game, you'll most likely laugh your ass off at their bad acting or how nonchalantly they take to being defeated in battle.People with larping experience, like myself, know differently. We know that this is EXACTLY how larpers act in real life and in their respective games. As such, its not that funny and our reaction can only be ""yeah.. and?"" Aside from the larping, this film still isn't funny.First of all, Paul Rudd isn't funny when he rants in the beginning of the film and wholly unemotional when he tries lifting lines from movies to win back his girlfriend. Sean William Scott is also back playing the same role he plays in every film. Here are some boobies. Go fetch.Then we have Jane Lynch playing a counselor mash-up between Courtney Love and Martha Stewart and remains completely unentertaining throughout the film between her unnecessary and badly delivered crack whore metaphors and her running yet disturbing ""What does this look like?"" gag.The only interesting or believable character in the film is Ronnie Shield's mother, Karen, who apparently didn't warrant having a last name for her character even though we know her son's last name. Go figure. Unfortunately while it hints at her having more than two-dimensions (and two emotions) in the film, her character is woefully underdeveloped and unused.This film is just plain not interesting even to a seasoned larper. 4 out of 10 stars, for the sexploitation and the larping scenes.",Role Models

I was originally deciding on a rating of 6 or so, but as the movie got closer towards the 3/4 mark, it just got SO funny with the whole ""roleplaying"" parts and some of the funny awkward moments. I was laughing so hard it hurt at that point, so i hadda bump it up to an 8 rating.It's got a really good positive message too, which is to do what you love, no matter what anyone else says about it or you. (as if there isn't enough movies with a similar plot)The story line was actually very boring and seemed to hold a really dull feel to it, yet in this movie that seems ""okay"" for some odd reason. The cast really brings it alive with the random heavy cursing scenes and occasional punchlines which i've yet to hear in any other movies that i can recall.It's not a super quotable movie, however its Definitely got a few good ones in there....so it works out okay.It's basically a movie with a dull story line, but the movie has so many awkward and blatant heavy language on and off, and with the whole ""role-playing world of warcraft"" scenes or whatever you wanna compare it to.....the movie is just awesome....",Role Models

I simply just cannot understand how this stodgy stuff gets such a high rating. Even Metacritic is also favorable. Some nominations as well. Well there is one win I definitely agree with - the most offensive Male character award. Hands down, show of hands or count of rotten tomatoes. I honestly can't get my head around how there are so many morons to actually like such a dull excuse for a plot, such repellent characters, really offensive speech - especially when kids are involved. The movie was supposed to end with a feel good take home message. I definitely did not stay up for that. It lost all credibility to do that, with the 'drunken lecture at school' scene. A later scene sums up all that's bad in this movie. An 8 year old (does he really have to be black) slaps his would be carer in the face. Are we supposed to laugh at this?

But after seeing this crap, I got the idea he wasn't putting in any effort, along with Paul Rudd who was ""Mike"" in Friends, whom I thought was hilarious in the show.Rudd basically plays a bit of a whiner, which I thought would have been funny if the movie had progressed properly with a bit of direction with his complaints, but no,he just remains the same throughout, in all honesty, he just wasn't funny at all, which was disappointing because I actually like the actor which was one of the main reasons for going to see this. I just wish he got a better script to work with There were a few laughs all in all, more on Sean William Scotts side, which was rare enough.2 Characters I could not stand in this movie was 1.

And whats with all her pointless lines about ""Bu*******ng""?? i just don't get it. For an ex junkie, ALL she did was talk about drugs, and being funny about it, which was ridiculous. And 2. The black kid, Ronnie. Im not taking this movie on a serious personal level, but this kid just turned out to be a foul mouthed brat, and just did NOT strike me as being funny at all, all he did was curse and shout at people, I just couldn't laugh, all I could do was roll my eyes and shake my head yet again.

132,danhollow,One of those Crude-but-Funny Films that works,8,5 October 2011,"I hear a lot of bad things about Paul Rudd, and I hear (and say my fair share of) bad things about Sean William Scott. This movie works perfectly for both of them. Their characters are both funny, but not over-the-top or just stupid. Actually, they are stupid on one level, but the kind of stupid we enjoy, the kind we can relate to more. They say what comes to their mind with little regard to who is listening. This makes them potentially the worst role models in history. That is the main premise of this film. These two guys have to do community service time after one of them goes a little overboard while advertising one of those Monster-esque sports drinks. They have to watch/guide two kids, or go to prison. One of our kids is a Fantasy dork; but when you see the fantasy world he gets to inhabit; it looks like fun. The other is one of the funniest kids I've ever seen. He swears like one of the kids from Superbad, and everything he says is pure comedy gold. He's like a 7 year old Martin Lawrence with the material of Dave Chapelle. The guys have problems and issues through the nose and the less maturity than most of the kids, but as the kids start to open up to them, they open up as well. It isn't the typical ""I know how you must be feeling"" stuff either. It is more like how people actually meet and make relationships, and entertaining besides. Hope you like Sex and Rock and Roll. As for the supporting actors/characters; they are all hilarious as well. Jane Lynch is hilarious as the head of the community service center, ""ideal"" role model Gary is perfect for making us see these two morons in a better light, and Ken Jeong is perfect as the King of the Realm (watch the movie for full understanding). All together, it's crude, but it's funny. It's absolutely worth watching if you like to laugh. I don't recommend bringing your kids, though.",Role Models

The first 15- 20 minutes are somewhat odd, filled with jokes that fall flat and a pointless random Louis CK cameo (wtf?).Once the guys join Sturdy Wings is when a lot of the funny scenes happen. Its often the actors improv thats entertaining and not the writing. Mintz-Plasse' nerdy charisma is hilarious to watch of course, and Paul Rudd always gives a solid effort.You can absolutley tell this is a 2008 comedy, as it has many tropes of the era. One issue with the film I have is with it's editing. Seriously. Many weird cuts, bad pacing at times, and some jarring transitions. Felt mediocre in places.In conclusion though, you can still get some laughs out of this dumb comedy. It accomplishes what it wants to without dragging too much.

A big portion of the laughs also go to Bobb'e Thompson as one of the sharp talking children to be mentored. The plot does fall to predictability and all of the best jokes being placed in the first half, which makes it loose steam as the film progresses.

137,yocca_98,Brilliant comedy,7,6 June 2009,"Was way better than I thought it was going to be. I usual expect most American comedies to have the usual plot line and this one sounded no different. Some good work from the dependable Paul Rudd, Sean Willam Scott and especially (McLovin) Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson who make it into a pretty decent comedy. After going off the rails in a boring job, the two adults are given the chance to avoid jail by mentoring some difficult kids in the community. The results and ending are rarely ever in doubt so there is not much in the way of spontaneous laughter, but in general its not quite as bad a film as some might make out, certainly worth a watch, just not a list topper.",Role Models
138,jurassicmarc,A comedy that delivers.,9,10 January 2009,"Off the back of some recent 'star studded' comedy let downs like Tropic Thunder or Pineapple Express comes what I believe to be the comedy to beat in 2009. The storyline is so formulaic that you would almost groan if someone explained it too you but the actors, writing and overall characterisation lift this movie to be much more rewarding. The dialogue is razor sharp especially from Paul Rudd who is on excellent form (as both actor and co writer) why he is not a bigger star is frankly criminal. He works excellently alongside Sean William Scott who is at his best here dare I say it as good as his turns in the America Pie movies (of which for me he was always the star).Its when working with there younger counter parts that the movie really elevates itself from just another laugh at the dysfunctional slackers flick. Christopher Mintz- Plasse has to be commended here especially rather than just playing 'Mclovin' again he creates in Augie a much more rounded character and I found it hard not to be routing for him in his Fantasy battles. Bobb'e J Thompson is so adorably obnoxious that his scenes with William Scott are a joy to watch. I've always liked William Scott and its nice to see him finally lay to rest the ghost of 'Stifler'. All in all if you want to laugh your ass off at a great comedy with a gifted cast then Role Models is for you I for one will be seeing it again.",Role Models
139,senorjuez,Best Comedy in Years!,10,12 April 2010,"The premise of this film involves two co-workers who travel to various Los Angeles area schools doing anti-drug sales presentations for an energy drink manufacturer. Paul Rudd plays Danny, a somewhat-uptight veteran sales rep who is dissatisfied with his job and personal life. Seann William Scott plays Wheeler, a free-spirited, live-for-the-moment party animal who serves as the company mascot on these excursions. A bad choice of actions puts the two men on the wrong side of the law and to avoid jail they must volunteer in a Big Brother-like organization run by a former drug addict. Danny is paired with a nerdy outcast whose main hobby is participating in a medieval, role-playing combat game while Wheeler is given a foul-mouthed black kid who comes from a broken home and has driven away several other volunteers in a short amount of time.At first things do not go well with these pairings, but eventually Danny and Wheeler are able to connect with the boys. This comes to an abrupt end due to a couple of errors in judgment that alienate the young boys and put Danny and Wheeler's freedom and friendship in jeopardy. During their time as mentors in the program, Danny and Wheeler both developed a sense of emotional maturity by putting the boys needs ahead of their own. They both got as much out of the experience as the boys did and are determined to make things right.While the humor is often risqué, what really makes this a great film overall is the on-screen pairing of Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott. They worked well together even though their characters are polar opposites. I think anybody who sees Role Models will enjoy it.",Role Models
140,MasterDebator5,"Paul Rudd makes a smart comedy about a pair of idiots in ""Role Models""",9,25 November 2008,"Role ModelsDirected by David Wain.Starring Paul Rudd, Seann William Scott and Elizabeth Banks.Apparently no longer content with playing second fiddle to Seth Rogen and Steve Carell, Paul Rudd steps firmly into the limelight for ""Role Models."" Rudd's big break has been long overdue; the actor is most popular for peppering already funny movies with his supporting roles. Here, however, he proves to be an excellent leading man. Perhaps this is due to his experience in the genre, or maybe it's his confidence in the material (Rudd co-wrote the script with David Wain, the film's director).The set-up is simple: Danny (Rudd) finds himself bitter when he is forced to reflect on his dead-end job. He works everyday with Wheeler (Seann William Scott, likable but typical), an easygoing but unambitious partner with an ever-positive attitude. The two spend their day peddling energy drinks in public high school auditoriums, leading to Danny's sour moods. When Danny's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) gets fed up with his pessimism, she sends him packing. His ensuing meltdown while on the job goes more than a bit too far, and both he and Wheeler wind up in trouble with the law. In a bid to dodge jail time, the two out-of-luck losers reluctantly accept their only alternative: mentoring kids. The rest is typical comedic fare, considerably heightened by a talented cast and smart writing.Much of the film's success is a result of Rudd and Scott's chemistry, both with each other and with their unwilling child assignments. Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie Shields (played by 12 year-old scene stealer Bobb'e J. Thompson), a pint-sized pain who takes joy in raising hell for his mentor. Meanwhile, Danny is tasked with relating to Augie Farks (Christopher Mintz-Plasse; ""Superbad's"" infamous McLovin), a reluctant loner and a make-believe knight who takes to donning capes and carrying around fake swords.Both mentors initially have trouble relating to their pupils, and, of course, things get way out of hand. ""Role Models"" isn't going to redefine the conventions of its genre, but it is self-aware and embracing of this fact. There are plenty of laughs to be had, and thankfully the movie never gets too sappy or self-important when the time inevitably comes to present its moral. ""Role Models"" encourages viewers to be themselves, but not at the expense of humor.The film is sincerely satisfying because it never tries to fool its audience. ""Role Models"" knows its place and tries only to stir up laughs, which is very refreshing. Hopefully this is just Rudd's first of many ventures into screen writing, because he has made a truly smart comedy about a pair of idiots.Final Grade: B+",Role Models
141,Planet-man77,Wain's first wide-release is a winner!,8,9 November 2008,"I'm a longtime fan of Wain's work, first as a member of Stella and later discovering The State and my now-all-time-favourite-movie 'WET HOT American SUMMER', which he also directed and co-wrote.I purposely avoided all reviews of this, determined to see it. The commercials made it look like passable swear-and-slapstick humour, but as it turns out, they didn't do it justice. I was happily surprised at how funny it was and especially loved the whole live-action RPG plot which kind of held the whole thing together. Everyone in the theatre laughed their asses off at the movie, and it's actually stuck with me since seeing it last night, which most recent vulgar-coms haven't really done.All in all, it's a great mix of shock comedy with a good story and script, and I definitely recommend it. Here's to a lifetime of great stuff from David Wain.... I have to admit I was disappointed with 'THE TEN', but this balances it out. I really hope Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter have roles in his next flick!",Role Models
142,hellfire_30,Surpringly Entertaining - Don't judge before you've seen it.,6,22 January 2009,"I had a lot of doubts and pre-judgements about Role Models before I even watched it I'm afraid to say, and I guess the trailer was probably the main negative influence - it basically painted it as American pie... now with responsibility. This sort of comedy has become a over worked horse - flogged to death and then given a few more hits for good measure.Since the original American Pie -the 'Godfather' of the genre if you will; there has been a whole host of pretenders to the crown, with increasingly less difference between them. An exception to this was probably the relatively recent Superbad, which gave a much needed breath of fresh air to the whole premise, and coincidently gave one of Role models' biggest personalities their big break (Christopher Mintz-Plasse)Taking all of this into account, it was actually quite surprising that I found this film was actually very entertaining; even side-split-tingly funny in places. I personally put this down to the strength of two standout characters; Augie and Danny. Danny, played by Paul Rudd portrays a good natured yet jaded guy in a dead end job, his situation grinds him down to the point of borderline depression and general apathy with just about everything. The concept is entirely believable, and is givenextra weight by the way Rudd just seems to fit into it like a glove - it was almost like he was born to play this role. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Augie, a geek with an obsession over Medieval Role-play - emphasized by the fact he never leaves the house without his cloak. He has problems at home and a lack of self-confidence that goes without saying. Both are incredibly rich characters that allow us emphasize with their troubles and yet at the same time laugh at their mishaps. The other characters are not nearly as interesting, perhaps a quota had been fulfilled with the previous two. Sean William Scott reprises his usual sex-obsessed moronic role, which has at this point grown stale if it has not done so already and annoyingly grating. Elizabeth Banks is a peripheral figure portraying a clichéd romantic interest and Bobb'e J. Thompson conforms to the irrationally angry African American stereotype that made for the most part cringe worthy viewing. However, Some minor characters really did shine as well, but sadly their contribution was limited; King Argotron and Kuzzik being the most prominent. The one liners in this as you would expect hilarious, and the entire segment in which they were involved a stroke of genius.It's all the more disappointing though that the good performances and one-liners apparent in this movie are dragged down by some fairly large flaws. Perhaps the major one being the story line is largely by the numbers and predictable. Add to this Scott's 'Wheeler' character; incredibly annoying whilst on screen, and you can't help shake the impression that the biggest contribution his character gives is a vehicle for female nudity in a couple of sexually explicit scenes to appease the teenage boys in the audience. There is also a sharp tendency to over do profanity in the dialogue. This is a modern comedy after all, so you would expect swearing and obscenity in some capacity, but it went over the top in more than a few places, and maybe its just a minority feeling on this but when you over do a comedic tool like swearing - which is there to add emphasis and rhetoric force to moments, it just loses something and in turn becomes a little clunky - with certain things in this world; less is sometimes more.The final nail in the coffin however is the film really does stutter and stall towards it's conclusion; the jokes dry up, and we shift to the usual Hollywood sentimentality. This is a real shame, because for the most part, the first two thirds of the movie had a good flow to it - despite the imperfections hampering it. It's an entertaining comedy that knows exactly what it is - and plays to it's strength accordingly. Some weak characters and a poor climax really hinder it, but some scant moments of charm and a seemingly endless list of one liners redeem it from being placed in the same category as your average rowdy comedy. Still worth a watch, but will probably not leave with you a lasting impression.",Role Models
143,manny-97,One of the BEST Comedies of Year,9,5 November 2008,"Actors Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are some of the key players responsible for the renewed popularity of the R-rated comedy genre. Rudd, with his partnership with the reigning king of R-rated comedy, Judd Apatow, and Scott, with his unforgettable role as Stifler in the ""American Pie"" films.With the new flick ""Role Models,"" Rudd and Scott teamed up to make a movie that's raunchy and potty-mouthed, but guess what? The film is one of the best, if not ""the"" best comedy of the year.It's quite surprising that ""Role Models"" began its inception as a dramatic script until Rudd came along. The actor helped reinvigorate the screenplay (the movie is his first as a scriptwriter) and the result is a laugh-out-loud film with a genuine emotional core at its heart.Rudd and Scott star as Danny and Wheeler, two salesmen who trash a company truck on an energy drink-fueled bender. Upon their arrest, the court gives them a choice: do hard time or spend 150 service hours with a mentorship program called Sturdy Wings.Helping the duo is Danny's soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend, Beth (the always dependable Elizabeth Banks), a lawyer who's fed up with her boyfriend's antics. She advises Danny and Wheeler to spend time at the mentorship program instead of jail.At Sturdy Wings, our bumbling heroes are surrounded by annoying do-gooders. Leading the pack is the scene-stealing Jane Lynch as Gayle Sweeney, the head of the program who's a recovering cocaine-addict herself.Danny is assigned to take care of Augie (""Superbad's"" McLovin, Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful 16-year old obsessed with medieval role play. Meanwhile, Wheeler must learn to tame Ronnie (newcomer Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed, tough-as-nails fifth grader.Directed by David Wain (""The Ten,"" ""Wet Hot American Summer""), ""Role Models"" worked because of the great chemistry of the cast. Rudd and Scott wisely let the younger actors shine.Mintz-Plasse, who was relegated to a one-hit wonder status with his McLovin role, proves that he's an excellent comedic actor with great timing. Same can be said with Thompson. You will be aghast to hear foul words coming out of his mouth, but you will be equally charmed by the young actor.The production is also blessed by a great team. The medieval role play war scene becomes a gripping fight-to-the-finish battle royale because of stunt coordinator, Jeff Imada, who coordinated the fight sequences for the ""Bourne"" films.Everyone walking out of the theaters after watching ""Role Models"" had contented smiles on their faces. You will laugh at the funny moments and feel emotional at the tender scenes. Come to think of it, this bro-mantic movie is really the best comedy of the year. And for that, ""Role Models"" gets 3 ½ model behavior kisses",Role Models

Don't know how did it happen with the ranking, but the movie definitely doesn't deserve it.The story is very cliché - like at least thousand of other movies. First you get introduced to characters, they fight with each other, then there is a new conflict (and of course with some cheesy music in background) and finally a happy end, everybody becomes friends again! Hands up! The actors play not bad, and there is a couple of nice jokes, but indeed there is too much of dirty (and I mean it) toilet humour. Who is supposed to watch this movie?

Christopher Mintz-Plasse from Superbad and Robb'e J. Johnson are excellent as the kids. Jane Lynch brings her signature brand of demented free association to the role of the charity-addicted leader of a kids charity. If you liked Superbad, Pineapple Express and 40 Year Old Virgin, go!

Danny Donahue's cynical outlook is easy to relate too, but so is Wheeler's happy-go-lucky attitude. They are the right compliment to each other.Lots of swearing, so be careful with little kids, but the moral is great, and none of the swearing is used in an aggressive way towards another person, i.e., non-threatening.

It tries to have a story, but it's really just about two guys who are REALLY stupid and can't function in normal situations. Ha-ha. Nothing about it is clever.The protagonists are unbelievably stupid but it somehow set up as if you will root for them while they struggle with problems that they themselves created. As for having a moral, I don't need a lesson in how to function like a normal person because I already can.The writers basically thought, ""Wouldn't it be funny if we wrote a comedy about a guy going into the Big Brother program?"" (No.) The next question is, ""Should we make him be the bad Big Brother, or should we make the Little Brother a problem child Why not BOTH! Then they can be buddies!""

150,grant-265,Very funny - but . . .,7,23 February 2009,"I saw this film over the weekend and though I didn't quite get the belly laughs from it that a previous critic did, it was highly amusing with some clever running jokes - particularly the disingenuous double-entendres which were peppered throughout the movie. What spoiled it for me was the denouement which was predictable and tied up all the loose ends in one fell swoop. At that point I felt slightly cheated. I also felt that to achieve this ending a set of rather contrived circumstances were introduced which I was just unable to buy into. For me a good film is made complete by an ending which doesn't seem rushed or mangled and one that doesn't leave you with the feeling of ""is that it?"". Also I personally have a problem with kids using foul language on screen. I don't like to hear kids swearing repeatedly and for me there's something a little immoral in not only encouraging them to swear to order, to but to script the thing for them. Maybe this a puritanical streak I possess but each use of the four letter word by a kid barely out of short pants, jarred a little. Additionally I can swallow so much poetic license and fully realise that it is over-the-top characterisation which make a film funny, but Jane Lynch - the manager of Sturdy Wings - came across as too unstable and wacky to have ever been allowed in such a position of responsibility with young kids. If you can swallow that lot along with the cop-out ending and foul-mouthed kids, then you will find the film very funny, wittily put together and enjoyable.",Role Models

Let the hilarity ensure.I really enjoyed that the entire cast of Mtv's ""The State"" (It was a sketch comedy show that was a lot like Monty Python and The Kids In The Hall) makes appearance in this movie. Without those characters the movie wouldn't have been as funny. Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott were good in scenes they didn't act together, but I really didn't see them much as a comedy duo. As for the kids in this one, Christopher Mintz-Plase (""SuperBad"") is Auggie,a kid who loves live action role playing games. The one who steals the show is Bobbe J Thompson as the foul mouthed Ronnie Shields. He is funnier than the two leads one of the most memorable.

158,armedelmo,Rudd and Scott Team Up For One of the Funnieset Comedies of The Year!,8,8 November 2008,"I've always been a big fan of Rudd through the Apatow movies. Now drifting away from Apatow, but still venturing into crude comedies, he teams up with Sean William Scott, who relives a small fraction of his infamous Stiffler character. The movie plot is simple. Rudd and Scott play two energy drink spokesmen who go from school to school explaining the negatives of doing drugs. Instead, they suggest drinking a Minotaur. We see them go from school to school, even cussing out a bunch of kids, and then all goes downhill for Rudd. He proposes to his girlfriend of 7-8 years, played by Elizabeth Banks, and she tells him no, and she's moving out. Things couldn't get any worse for the guy, until their truck gets towed. Well Rudd, being strung up as hell, decides to drive the truck off the tow truck and up a statue of a bull. Elizabeth banks works things out with the judge and gives them 150 hours of community service at Sturdy Wings.Now this is where the movie really kicks off. Once we're introduced to Augie Farks and Ronnie Shields, all hell breaks loose. Augie, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, somehow takes on a more nerdier role than McLovin from Superbad. Rudd's first impression is that he's going to have a long 150 hours with this kid. Augie is a part of a real life Dungeons and Dragons group, LAIRE, who hold these fake battles in the middle of fields and forests. Rudd knows that this is completely ridiculous and there is no way he will connect with his kid.Scott is paired up with Ronnie, played by Bobb'e J. Thompson, who is a foul mouthed little brat who makes Scott's life a living hell. It's good to see Scott paired up with a kid like this because you know he's going to connect with him since Scott plays the typical young partier. Aside from having a few frustrating situations with Ronnie, they both do end up having a good friendship.With most of the plot lined out, let's talk about how the comedy. First off, Rudd, as usual, delivers some great one liners. Scott is great too, and it's the chemistry between the two that really shines. Mintz-Plasse and Thompson are also great, as they try to live with their mentors. A lot of the comedy does rely on dialogue. There is barely any physical slapstick, apart from Rudd hitting Scott in the balls with a foam sword, but really it's great fun. Oh, and how could I forget Jane Lynch, who nearly steals the show. She plays the organization's leader, and explains how she was a recovering drug addict and alcoholic.I did have some gripes with the film. I think I speak for a large number of people when I say that Ronnie could've sworn a tad less. It seems they thought that having a little kid blurt obscenities would be funny every time. Well it was funny at first, but then it got a little tried and true. Another for me was that towards the third act, it felt a little dry. Now this is before the big battle scene. More so the dinner with Augie's parents and the party Wheeler goes to.With all gripes aside, this movie was very funny. It wasn't too crude either. I mean it had it's fair share of sex jokes but it couldn't hold a candle to the Apatow flicks. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants a good laugh for the weekend. 8/10.",Role Models
159,uscdude,Low Expectations == Excellent Time,9,12 November 2008,"This is really, really quality comedy. Although I love Kevin Smith to death, I think this movie made me laugh more than Zack and Miri (still excellent, but nonetheless...). You know how most commercials give away the entire movie (I'm looking at you, BODY OF LIES and EVERY COMEDY EVER MADE)? This one doesn't. The plot really is predictable but unpredictable. But I'm sidestepping the entire issue.This movie is f*cking hilarious. And don't pretend to take that as some general comment heaped upon any foul-mouthed comedic work that Hollywood seems itchy to greenlight these days. This is some really, really funny stuff. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott have some excellent chemistry here. Like Jake and Elwood chemistry. They basically are the driving force of this movie. However, supporting cast does an equally excellent job. The woman who plays the children's center director basically nailed her performance and always had me in hysterics. And the two kids; ahh, this is the icing on the cake. Ronny and Augie were genius.Basically, this is definitely on the top of my list of highly underrated comedies (Oh, Tapeheads... how I love thee). I would absolutely see this in theaters again.In summary, check this out for a riotous, consistently funny 100 minutes of laughter.",Role Models

But on behalf of its producers I must say it doesn't fall into any known movie category, it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! It's a ""Neurological drama"" ! It saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person's brain.It's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one. It drives you speechless, all you members go numb, your mouth falls open and remains so, and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf.No small feat for such a sort of a ""movie"".The only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!",Role Models
161,Karmakrazy,"In slacker genre, ""Models"" stand out",8,11 November 2008,"The standard for comedies aimed at folks under 30 has become ""foul mouth, fond heart."" But too many have no heart at all, just a pretense of warmth to satisfy convention after two hours of mockery. ""Role Models"" is different. Though its grosses may not soar into the realm occupied by ""Superbad"" and ""American Pie,"" it has more sympathy for its characters.Its stars come from those two movies, not to mention ""Knocked Up"" and Christopher Guest's improvisational pieces. There are different flavors here, and director David Wain blends them smoothly. The script passed through at least three people besides Wain  Ken Marino, Timothy Dowling and star Paul Rudd  yet it holds together, with everyone in the film playing to his own strength.Rudd is Danny, the same kind of guy he played in ""Knocked Up"": a quietly cynical man unsatisfied by his job, prospects and long-term relationship with a woman (Elizabeth Banks). Seann William Scott is Wheeler, the same kind of guy HE played in ""American Pie,"" a breezy horndog who thinks every beer and babe are fair game.They work selling an energy drink, until Danny goes ballistic at a middle school. They're sentenced to 150 hours of community service at a Big Brothers-like nonprofit led by Gayle (Jane Lynch, whose daffy monologues sound as if she were making them up for Guest).Enter Augie and Ronnie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson). The former is a role-playing, shy, bespectacled teen too nerdy to approach a girl  yes, the same kind of kid Mintz-Plasse played in ""Superbad,"" though this one realizes he's a nerd  and the latter is a sewer-mouthed 10-year-old who compensates for short stature with a long string of crude remarks, most of them about sexual impulses he can hardly have had. (Wain and company wear that joke out quickly.) You see where this is going: The two men botch their assignments, straighten themselves out, realize they truly like their young charges and intervene successfully in their lives. But I don't think you'll expect the way in which it happens, though the movie drops a couple of clues.Not all the problems get solved, not all the characters find the right people to love, not everyone has an epiphany. (Poor Augie will be just as unpopular in high school, away from the world of foam-padded swords and hand-sewn capes he inhabits on weekends.) The nice thing at last, though, is that each character is encouraged to ""find his flock,"" as schoolteachers say, however oddly plumed that flock appears to others.The film deserves its R rating. I wish producers hadn't skittered away from a PG-13 approach, afraid the 18-to-25 crowd would abandon them; this is a movie middle schoolers would've enjoyed  and maybe learned from  while their older siblings and parents were smiling at double entendres. You can't say that about most offerings in this crass, overcrowded genre.",Role Models
162,daniel-1759,Raunchiness isn't the best part of Role Models,6,22 October 2008,"I just got back from seeing Role Models, and I must tell you that, first and foremost, it is excessively crude and vulgar, which is not my cup of tea. However, it is extremely funny and the laugh out loud moments out-weighed the ""Huhs?"" probably 2 to 1.The plot revolves around Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott), two guys who work for an energy drink company Minotaur, fashioned after Red Bull. Their job involves them going to schools and Danny will give a tepid stay-off-drugs-but-drink-Minotaur spiel as Wheeler prances around in a Minotaur mascot costume. Wheeler is the party guy and Danny is a bit uptight, but it's Danny who snaps after he realizes he's in a dead-end job and his girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks) won't marry him after his lame, desperate proposal.After attempting to save their Minotaurmobile from being towed, Danny and Wheeler are in legal trouble but instead of jail they get . . . (dramatic pause) . . . community service. They are sent to a Big Brothers knock-off program called Sturdy Wings, run by a crazy ex-drugee played by the great Jane Lynch, who plays the part of ultimate den mother crossed with perverse eccentricity.Wheeler is paired with Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a little kid who makes the children of South Park look to be choir boys and Danny is given Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a Dungeons & Dragons caliber of nerd. Shenanigans ensue, no one likes each other at first, but Danny and Wheeler have to make it work or they go to jail.The eventual destination is a foregone conclusion  the guys and the kids will bond, teach each other lessons, etc.Here's the frustrating aspect about Role Models for me: it's a comedy with a heartwarming message about family, kids, and fitting in, but at the same time it's so utterly perverse that no kid should ever see it. Teens and young adults who enjoy dirty comedies will doubtlessly love it. I suspect that toning down the sexual humor and crass language to PG-13 concentration and Role Models would fall into that Adam Sandler-movie category when it's safe for teens and parents and it's still kinda crude and (sometimes) funny.This isn't some sort of call for censorship by any means, but although the profanities and lewdness from the kids garners some laughs, the bulk of the laughs come from Danny's venture into the medieval realm of L.A.I.R.E. with Augie. Danny's interactions with ""King Argotron"" (Ken Jeong), culminating with an applause inducing entrance that I don't want to spoil, is by far the show-stealer. And all those scenes totally didn't need hard R-rated material to be funny.--Daniel J. Roos (film.ispwn.com)",Role Models

Doesn't even come close to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" or even ""Step Brothers"". The story is very predictable, but that's not the biggest issue with this movie - the whole story is just boring. I admire Paul Rudd as an actor, but I feel this really wasn't his best role.

Okay, the original was pretty good.Here we have (no spoiler alert needed) two brainless idiots who were given the choice of jail or community service for some brainless accident that they had. Okay, enough with the premise of how they became Role Models.Now we move on to the children of which are suppose to be in need of Role Models. Sadly, Hollywood decided to choose some kids who missed the 'growing up' part of childhood and went straight to acting like careless young adults complete with the vernacular and street smarts of a common thug along with a kid suffering from some sort of archaic Dungeons and Dragons affliction.I wonder where are the child advocates that profess their dedication to keeping children safe from harm and influence unbecoming their ages? We protect our kids from sexual predators, bullying, abusive clergy but yet Hollywood, the neo-babysitters of irresponsible parents, are not held responsible for the their abusing relationship with child stars.Where are the parents of these child stars that are mismanaged into playing adult roles? This movie is rated 'R' and for very good reason.Then why is Hollywood allowed to use underage children in a movie for which their age group cannot go see?

Who'd've thunk it -- one of the sharper comedies in a long time. Also surprisingly, and I don't think this counts as a spoiler, it doesn't move towards the trite, predictable, sappy ending you'd expect -- which is a pleasant surprise of its own. Sure it's upbeat, but it's not quite what I predicted the ending would be... like I said above -- it's well written! If I were to nitpick, it's that a couple relationship reconciliations are underplayed just enough that it's difficult to imagine how the character(s) came on-side... maybe one extra explanation of how/why Ronnie would be supportive of Augie -- but for the most part, the characters are broad enough that their coming together doesn't really hit you as unbelievable.

The humour was so good, the actors really seemed to enjoy themselves and had fun with their roles. Christopher Mintz Plasse as Mclovin in superbad wasn't the best role for him in my opinion but as augie in this film no other actor could have played him as funny.

170,Lee_Stobby,"Mildly amusing escapism, yet nothing more",4,13 October 2008,"Admittedly, this is not exactly the kind of film I normally go for, but I found the whole thing rather insipid and tiresome. Compared to recent comedies that actually attempt to explore ANY larger issue or context (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Stranger than Fiction, or Superbad, for example), this definitely is a huge regression. There is an okay (yet clichéd) story dealing with acceptance/tolerance/be-who-you-want-to be/blah blah, but I found that any real exploration of real issues and dramatic interest was completely undermined by the constant and lazy reliance on easy, cheap laughs. It is a parade of shock humor that rarely raises above a 6th grade level of engagement: ""Cursing is fun,"" ""Boobies are cool,"" ""You're gay,"" ""Nerds are weird,"" etc. This kind of humor can be mildly amusing in small doses to fill the gaps, but as the totality of the entertainment value of a film it can be rather tiring. Granted, the jokes are quick and most are mildly affective. However, the film completely fails to do anything beyond this basic level and consequently hurts any real cinematic engagement. The entire film becomes nothing more than a string of lazy, intellectually insulting jokes. I'm not saying that this or movies like this have to be Citizen Kane, but a film that only seeks to embody immature humor is only going to entertain me so much. Throw me a bone, please. It is not difficult, as the above mentioned films accomplished this feat to at least some degree.The performances are solid, especially from Jane Lynch and Elisabeth Banks, and there is a few good sight gags and chuckles. However, there is very little real interest in this film; it is hackneyed and devoid of creativity. There is nothing in this film I haven't seen before or couldn't see coming from a million miles. I had the entire narrative pinned by about 15 minutes into the film and nothing else in the film makes up for its structural and cinematic deficiencies. It is stupid, lazy, uninspired and proud of it. If you are interested in some mindless escapism, you could definitely do worse, but you could also do a lot better.4/10",Role Models

Sianai tablets, yet shockingly even less intriguing. Paul Rudd (Danny) is the exact opposite: easily angered, wildly depressed over nothing and combative over stupid things such as an appropriate name for a coffee cup/size. Beth (played by Elizabeth Banks), who is Danny's wife in the movie, adds nothing. Oh ya, except that she also becomes Danny's and Wheeler's lawyer once Danny drives his pickup on top of a bull statue. Hilarious, I know.Next up are our two troubled kids in need: Christopher Mintz-Plasse (plays Augie) and Bobb'e J. Thompson (plays Ronnie). Augie is a teenager who is obsessed with LARP (Live Action Role Play) and literally walks the walk and talks the talk of a Dungeons and Dragons type-of-character. Ronnie is a foul-mouthed 5th grader that no one can seem to contain.Ultimately, Danny is marked up with Augie and Wheeler is marked up with Ronnie. Following that, worn-out settings (i.e. house parties, camping) and a rampage of monotonous comedy is flooded onto the viewer like a Jihadist during a water-boarding.I hope you're sitting down for the ending: Augie kisses the girl he's always had a crush on.Two stars for the magician guy during the LARP event (he had a 1.2 second scene--watch carefully or you might miss the movie's far and gone best scene).Like my title says: my yawn yawned.",Role Models

Their message to students is simple; ""Don't do drugs."" Their alternate solution, however, is to instead make sure you have enough Minotaur Energy Drink in your system to keep you going.After having an even worse-than-usual day, Danny (Rudd) ends up getting himself and Wheeler arrested while on an energy drink-fueled rage. Their lawyer, who is also Danny's now-ex-girlfriend Beth (played by Elizabeth Banks, who is making her third appearance in theatres this month), is able to change the guys' jail sentence into 150 hours of community service, through a program called Sturdy Wings, a Big Brothers/Big Sisters-type program.This is where Danny meets his ""little"", Augie (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, better known as McLovin from ""Superbad""), and Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie (played by Bobb'e J. Thompson, who easily shatters any previous movie record for profanity by someone under the age of 13). Both Danny and Wheeler have a hard time connecting with their ""little"" at first, and have no real interest in them other than trying to finish their community service. Soon, through a few failed attempts, including a camping trip gone wrong, the guys realize that they can make a positive impact on these kids' lives. They become invested in helping them out any way possible, even if it means having to convince Augie's mom that her son is special and should be allowed to do whatever makes him happy, even if that means walking around in a cape.After a few years of mediocrity with limited-release movies like ""Southland Tales"" and ""The Promotion"", this may be a comeback of sorts for Seann William Scott, who is back to playing the type of character that made him famous throughout the ""American Pie"" trilogy. In ""Role Models"", he plays Wheeler, a care-free guy who likes to party, is popular with pretty much everyone, and despite having to dress up in a furry ""Minotaur"" costume at work, is happy with his life. It wouldn't take a huge stretch of the imagination to believe that Wheeler is the grown-up version of Stifler.For Paul Rudd, this is the movie that should bring him many more starring roles in the very near future. Sure, he was great in his supporting roles in ""Anchorman"" and ""Knocked Up"", but this was the long overdue example that Paul Rudd is capable of starring in a major comedy hit. Despite sharing equal billing with Seann William Scott, ""Role Models"" focuses on Rudd's character Danny getting out of his rut and learning to appreciate everything around him. His performance in ""Role Models"" only builds the anticipation for the expected January 2009 release of ""I Love You, Man"", starring Rudd alongside ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" star Jason Segel.""Role Models"" follows the fairly typical formula of 'guy who is down on life finds a way to bounce back', but does so in a new, refreshing way. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott make a great duo, and have several memorable, hilarious scenes together. Plus, if you've ever wanted to see four guys dressed up as rock band KISS, fighting with fake swords in an effort to win a Dungeons and Dragons-style tournament, then that is worth the price of admission alone.",Role Models
183,jr338076,Little Expectations... Great Movie,7,18 October 2008,"I had little expectations for this movie. In fact, I had never seen a preview for it, nor had even planned on going to see the movie, but I went because I received a free ""early viewing"" pass to see it at a local theaters. However, I was somewhat excited to see what the movie was like because of the cast: Paul Rudd (of Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin) Sean William Scott (""Stiffler"" from the great American Pie(s)), Christopher ""McLovin'"" Plasse, and Bobb'e J. Thompson (formerly of the little-acknowledged ""Tracy Morgan Show"").I must say, I was laughing throughout the majority of the movie. Paul Rudd's ability to tackled a similar role to his in 40 Year Old Virign, the lost soul who doesn't seem to enjoy where his career/life have taken him, came quite easy and he did well with the role. William Scott, playing the ADD, mildly stupid but honorable friend and ladies man came well.The real quality of the movie came out of the interaction Plasse and Thompson had with their ""BIG's"" Rudd and Scott... especially Thompson with Scott. Bobb'e Thompson will be a star in Hollywood--he's got poise and a great comedic sense and in addition has several years ahead of career. McLovin was good, in playing a similar ""nerd"" role, however he was even more nerdy in this film embracing the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" personality.My only reason for giving the movie a 7/10 was that it got a little ""cute"" towards the ending, and I think the movie could have concluded on a better note. In addition, I wish that rather than Plasse and Rudd accept his unusual liking of weird, anti-social lifestyles... I kind of hoped that Rudd turned him nerd gone popular guy in high school, however that's just my perspective.Either way, the movie was great... had me laughing a ton. Bobb'e J. Thompson is the highlight... also look for some laughs from the co-star Jane Lynch (who played the ""Circuit City"" manager in 40 Year Old Virgin)... she had some great lines for a recovering drug-fiend.",Role Models
184,henrito16-1,Is the idea of a negative role model an oxymoron?,6,16 November 2008,"This movie definitely does not push any new boundaries in the film industry. Role Models uses sex and cursing to make a few cheap jokes running through most of the movie. Yet, it uses well-timed jokes to generate a few laughs here and there that made the movie worth watching if you do not get too offended at seeing some breasts or hearing the constant use of profanity. This type of movie is definitely well received in the culture of young people, and I am guessing it won't become old anytime soon with young moviegoers. The movie speaks to the need for adults to invest in the lives of hurting kids who are lacking the traditional family unit. Studies show that kids who have a relationship with a caring non-family member usually are healthier. Sean William Scott and Paul Rudd's characters are not your typical role models who kids necessarily should emulate. Yet, through the chaos of the movie the two characters actually make a positive impact in the lives of the students and their families. Part of me wants to say that only in the movie world could characters with lives as crazy as these actually be fit to be an actual role model. One could wonder at what point does somebody actually qualify to invest his or her life in others. Maybe, the first act of selflessness portrayed in the movie is the crossing line one can actually be a role model. Is it too crazy to think that any of us can let go of our self-absorption and invest time into others?",Role Models

And Shawn William Scott is very funny playing a ""stiffler"" type of character with a soft spot. It was good to see McLovin in another movie but he was only OK playing the nerdy kid that knows he's nerdy. I loved him as the nerdy kid that thought he was cool. I'd rather laugh at him then feel sorry for him. Oh, And I agree this movie needs to be rated R. Nothing is funnier then kids cursing.

186,groseth-4,A solid film to be sure,9,24 April 2009,"I personally really enjoyed this film. The film doesn't push any bounds or reinvent the comedy, quite the opposite really. It follows your average comedy's progression to a T. What the film lacks in innovation it makes up for in execution.Paul Rudd and Sean William Scott are both featured in roles that are to be expected from the two. Scott plays a fast-talking energetic bachelor who is truly in love with life. Rudd as Scott's antithesis plays a miserable and sarcastic man in a dead-end job who wants more out of life. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) and Bobb'e J Thompson both play their roles well.The film is mostly toilet humor, bad language and sexual humor comprise the majority of the hour and forty-one minutes the film covers. At the heart of the film is a touching message which is something I have really come to enjoy in a comedy (Click comes to mind).So if you're the kind of viewer who expects groundbreaking material and a new and riveting story this movie is not for you. If you have EXTREMELY high expectations of your movies this is not for you. But if you're a casual movie goer who enjoys a simple film and aren't offended by nudity and foul language this film IS for you. I'm a young guy (19) and I'll say with confidence that most young folks will get a real kick out of it.",Role Models
187,PittGator23,Easily the best comedy of the year...,9,2 November 2008,"i kid you not. Just got back from a screening of this at my college. First of all, the atmosphere for this movie was great...being 300 college kids and such, second of all, everything in this movie works. It's the first comedy this year that I can truly say I laughed at every joke and enjoyed every moment of. I can not believe Universal didn't release this in the summer because it would have been a monster hit. Everyone involved is great (even though Seann William Scott kinda gets the back burner). Go see this movie with everyone you know and you'll have a great time. I wish I could take back the 10 bucks I gave to Zack and Miri yesterday and give it to Role Models.9/10(could become a 10 after multiple viewings)",Role Models
188,lookatmenowlookatyou,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.,10,7 April 2008,"Move over Superbad and Knocked Up. The guys from The State, The Ten, and Wet Hot American Summer have outdone themselves tenfold. I saw a preview screening a little less than a month ago, going in with no expectations. Paul Rudd's never written a movie before, but I enjoy Ken Marino and David Wain's work so I knew it would at least be amusing. Wow was I wrong. From start to finish, every line was perfectly written with perfect delivery from Rudd and company.If this movie isn't a hard R, it's going to suck big time. The movie's raunchiness is its best quality, and I can't wait to see it a couple more times on opening weekend.Extremely recommended for everybody.",Role Models
189,jzarzycki,"Very funny movie, but probably a limited audience",8,24 October 2008,"I just saw an advanced screening for this movie last night and I really liked it. It started out somewhat slow and the first 20 minutes or so was fairly run-of-the-mill. However, the jokes got much more frequent and better written as the movie went on. All in all, it's the sort of good mixture of raunchy and charming that we've come to expect in this post-Apatow era.Paul Rudd is, as always, fantastic. His deadpan sarcasm is a good offset to Sean William Scott's wild, juvenile humor. The two make for a solid comedy team, though Scott felt very much like the weaker of the two. Elizabeth Banks is always a welcome addition but plays a straight man here and is sort of a wasted talent. By far, though, the best performances are by the understated Mintz-Plasse and the way-way-less-understated Bobb'e Thompson. In addition to being funny, they're both inherently very likable as Mintz-Plasse does an excellent job being geeky in a non-stereotypical way while Thompson is foul-mouthed and offensive without being annoying (quite an accomplishment for ANY child actor.) The biggest problem with the film is its lack of clear purpose. The plot is very formulaic, boilerplate family comedy. It's the same ""adult forced into a difficult situation with children, comes to appreciate them, major adversity emerges, adversity resolved with happiness for all"" that has been around since Bad News Bears. However, this is NOT a family film. It has pretty extensive cursing and some nudity. I think the plot won't appeal very much to most people over 14, even though the film more than overcomes the cliché shortcomings, and the subject matter probably isn't appropriate for anyone under 10 (and that's a liberal viewpoint, to say the least.) This is a good movie. It's worth seeing. But I have a feeling many people are going to pass it over or focus too much on the negatives.",Role Models
190,darokios-19762,This movie broke me,2,14 March 2017,"I've liked this movie since it came out in 2008 I remember renting the DVD once it came out I always watched it when it was playing on TV. So fast-forward 8 years into the future, I'm now a university student studying film, In class and the teacher tells us that we are going to watch a movie, we walk into the screening room and the teacher plugs his hard drive full of movies and asks us what movie we want to watch. The obvious choice here would have been back to the future, but Nooo the people in class are apparently too stupid to realize that we would have to work on the movie after we watch it and they picked role models, a movie that even though not bad is plainer than a slice of white bread. Back to the future in the other hand is a bloody masterpiece. Rarely do you ever see a movie that takes such complicated concepts and conveys them in an easy to understand manner while still being accurate. The characters are amazing off the bat I understand and sympathize with all of them and I feel like I want to see them succeed. The script is awesome, foreshadowing stuff that's going to happen in the past and has some amazing dialogue. The special effects are as good as they are iconic(except for jaws 19 cause the shark still looks fake). I think I could ramble about this movie for way more that a pages but my point is that neither of these movies happen to have any similarities to Garfield: A tale of two kitties so that's why I give the movie two stars",Role Models
191,alexcoker,I long for this films whispering eye...,10,3 May 2021,"Generation to generation, films will always come and go, but Role Models will stay.This is perhaps my favourite film of all time. I watch it when I'm sad, I watch it when I'm happy and upon finishing it I always have a renewed lease on life and it sets me up for the week in front of me.I honestly laugh at every line and I don't think I'll ever get bored of it.For all those out there who haven't watched it yet, you won't regret it.",Role Models
192,kingofnerds,Waiting for Part 2,10,9 April 2018,We need this comedy to come back. We have super troopers 2 coming so you guys are next! Hope it happens. I would write a review but asking for a part 2 should explain it all. Fingers crossed.,Role Models
