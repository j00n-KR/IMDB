0,TheLittleSongbird,Muted indifference,5,23 April 2018,"'Mute had one of the best premises of any film from this early part of this year. One of the year's most unique and daring and of my recent film viewings and it was hard for me not want to see it or miss it with it being so heavily promoted. It also had a good cast on board as well as director Duncan Jones, responsible for two great films 'Source Code' and especially 'Moon', in a passion project. It made me sad and somewhat angry that such a fabulous concept was pretty much wasted by very wanting execution. 'Mute' is not a bad film, or a terrible one, it is much better than the negative reputation it's got. It's just that it's not a good one either, with the concept it had, the cast and the director one cannot help feeling it should have been much more. Easily Jones's worst film ('Moon' being his best) and his only less than decent one. Saw 'Mute' some weeks back on Netflix, but have been behind with my reviewing and film watching and it took some time to gather my thoughts.The best thing about 'Mute' is the production values. The film does look wonderful with some of the most beautiful and atmospheric visuals of the year thus far. The photography and production design are sheer beauty while technical aspects are just as eye catching and used wisely. The music is both hypnotic and haunting.First half had some great moments in atmosphere, emotion and character interaction. The most interesting aspect narratively is the chemistry between Justin Theroux and Paul Rudd. The characters are the only fully rounded ones, especially Rudd's who serves the most point to the narrative and the chemistry is suitably nuanced. Was not impressed by the cast generally, but Theroux and Rudd come off best, the only ones in fact, rising above the material. Both are great, Rudd gives his all in an against-type role but for me Theoux's intense and nuanced performance was even better. Didn't care for the rest. The support struggle in underwritten, shallow and often pointless, while Alexander Skargaard, even for a character that's mute, is a stiff and lifeless lead. Couldn't get behind his subplot at all. If anybody wants an example of a truly great lead performance as a mute character, look to Sally Hawkins in 'The Shape of Water'. Furthermore, while the first half was actually not perfect but with a good deal to like, the second half was a mess. How can such a unique concept be treated in such a derivative and far from creative way? The further 'Mute' progressed the duller, more muddled and more confusing the film got. If it tried to take on less story-wise and in themes had less characters, things would have been more intriguing and clearer. Character motivations are vague and introduced out of the blue, the themes and ideas are too often under-explored or muddled, tonally it's unfocused and too many elements go nowhere or take too long to get there. Jones's direction has passion and ambition and there are good intentions here, he just didn't seem to know what to do with the concept or different elements. The pace does drag and the film did feel too long by about 20-25 minutes. Overall, didn't love it. Didn't hate it. More like was indifferent towards it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Mute
1,Leofwine_draca,Overrated,4,9 March 2019,"MUTE is another sci-fi movie from the overrated Duncan Jones, whose best work so far has been middling Hollywood fare such as SOURCE CODE and WARCRAFT: THE BEGINNING. This one borrows the futuristic noir setting from BLADE RUNNER but proceeds to waste both time and talent in a boringly listless story that's all over the place with no proper narrative thrust or development. Alexander Skarsgard's mute protagonist bartender is the most interesting character here, but he's off-screen for lengthy sections while the film crawls along in the company of a pair of unpleasant doctors. For a film full of colour this is surprisingly colourless, and emotionally unsatisfying to boot.",Mute
2,SnoopyStyle,half and half,5,15 July 2018,"It's Berlin in the near future. Leo (Alexander Skarsgård) is a mute nightclub bartender. He fights two customers for harassing his waitress girlfriend Naadirah and gets fired. She has secrets and goes missing. Meanwhile, American surgeons Cactus Bill (Paul Rudd) and Duck (Justin Theroux) are working in the underground black market. The two stories cross paths again and again.Duncan Jones makes a franchise sequel to Moon although Sam Rockwell only has a cameo in this movie. It's after Moon in the same world but about different people. I'm drawn to Leo's story as he searches for Naadirah. It's a journey into the underbelly of Berlin. The other half of the movie is far less compelling. Cactus and Duck's journey has no destination. They have no goals. There is nothing driving them. Of course, there is an inevitable reveal of a connection but there is no point in following them before the reveal. It needs to play with time so that their journey ends with Cactus killing Naadirah just after the bar fight. It would end at the same time as Leo finding Cactus with the body. The two stories can take place during different times and end in the same place. As of now, half of this movie has no drive or tension. So it's half compelling and a half failure.",Mute
3,claudio_carvalho,"Promising Storyline, Messy Screenplay, Uninteresting Character",5,25 February 2018,"In the near future, in Berlin, the Amish bartender Leo (Alexander Skarsgård) works in a bar with his beloved girlfriend Naadirah (Seyneb Saleh) and her gay friend Luba (Robert Sheehan). Leo is mute since he was a boy and had an accident in a lake. His mother, averse to technology, did not let Leo to be submitted to a corrective surgery since she believed God would heal him. Meanwhile, the American surgeons Cactus Bill (Paul Rudd) and Duck (Justin Theroux) work for the local gangsters. Cactus Bill has a daughter and dreams on returning to the United States, but he does not have documentation since he deserted the army. His hope is to get fake documents with the mobsters so that he can go back home. His partner Duck has documents but is a pedophile and likes to live in Berlin. When Naadirah vanishes without a trace, Leo seeks her out and goes to the underworld of Berlin, where his life entwines with Cactus Bill and Duck. Will he find his beloved Naadirah?""Mute"" is a disappointing film by the cult-director Duncan Jones. Despite the good acting and great music score and cinematography that recalls ""Altered Carbon"", the promising storyline fails mainly because of the messy screenplay and the uninteresting lead character. Most of the viewers certainly wants to like ""Mute"", but Leo does not help since it is an unattractive and annoying character. In the end credits, Duncan Jones dedicates this film to his father David ""Bowie"" Jones and to his beloved nanny Marion Skene, an incredible woman for caring for him as a toddler when his parents split. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Mudo"" (""Mute"")",Mute
4,nogodnomasters,Then nothing else is important,7,4 March 2018,"Leo (Alexander Skarsgård) as an Amish child had an accident which left him mute. In a futuristic Berlin society (about like 5th Element) Leo works tending bar at Dreams. His girlfriend Naadirah (Seyneb Saleh) is a cocktail waitress with a secret and a past. The club has an ex-pat pedophile and an AWOL doctor working there for the Russian mafia as an important sub-plot. When Naad goes missing, our quiet Amish boy goes walking tall over the bad guys. This is a different film with not much to compare it to. You normally don't have Amish in science fiction. Different if anything else. Good characters. Guide: F-word. Brief nudity.",Mute
5,kosmasp,Stop the bleeding,6,8 May 2018,"Sometimes it is tough to stop the bleeding. Especially if you can't see the wound. This is weird and anything but normal. Now you can take that as a compliment and it really is better than just getting served the same thing over and over again. Yet while this isn't bad, I wouldn't call it good either. But it is tough to crawl through all the akwardness and get to the bottom of the ""problem"" (if you have a similar view).On the other hand, this is brutal. So don't be fooled by the fact that it is slow paced. It is heavy on drama and in the mood section and it has Paul Rudd in it. The ageless but somewhat different than you may know him Paul. So while the main character may be mute, some watching this may be speechless ...",Mute
6,CinemaSerf,Confused cyber-drama....,5,10 May 2020,"Alexander Skarsgård is ""Leo"" - a mute (strictly Amish) barman living in a futuristic Berlin. When his girlfriend goes AWOL he sets out to find her and encounters all sorts of detritus from the city's underworld gangster population. Paul Rudd & Justin Theroux as ""Cactus & Duck"" are the rather maverick pair of surgeons (the latter being a bit too keen on very young girls!) that provide much of the continuity, energy, and jeopardy in this rather limited drama. The plot is all over the place; there are too many ongoing storylines to allow you to focus and the voiceless nature of the title character makes it very difficult to establish much of a bond with him, or his predicament. The ending comes not a moment too soon. It's not a bad film, it's just a bit too surreal for me, sorry...",Mute
7,Wizard-8,"Pretty, but makes little sense",3,1 June 2020,"While some Netflix exclusive movies or TV shows are pretty good, there are also a number that don't work very well, and ""Mute"" unfortunately is one such example. Clearly a lot of effort was put into some aspects of the movie, because the cinematography, sets, and the special effects and props look very nice. Not only that, they manage to create a futuristic world that seems a lot more plausible than a lot of movies dealing with high tech/dystopian science fiction settings. However, all this effort with giving the movie style and color doesn't make up much for the fact that the script is a mess. Scenes that might provide some explanation simply aren't there. Other scenes run on for too long of a time. Characters disappear suddenly and don't pop up again for a long time (if at all, that is.) The story drags on and on, being much too long at 126 minutes. It's too bad, because along the way I did see a few ideas with great potential. If the screenwriters had tackled these ideas slowly for a long time while writing the script, we might have had something here. The best use for this movie is to use as background noise/visuals when your main focus is on something else more important.",Mute
8,deloudelouvain,Could have been better.,6,8 September 2018,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Not that it was a bad movie or so but it definitely could have been better. For the sci-fi part it was good, with nice futuristic elements and settings. As for the mystery and thriller part it clearly misses something. Something that would keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a long movie, more than two hours, and for a movie this long you just need more suspense to be entirely entertaining. The acting was not bad though, with good performances from Alexander Skarsgård and Paul Rudd. All in all Mute is worth watching but it could have been better.",Mute
9,siderite,Minimalist film that doesn't try too much and achieves even less,6,8 December 2019,"At its time, Moon was a revelation. A minimalist sci-fi with just one actor , Sam Rockwell, doing a great job and supported by Kevin Spacey's voice in the form of a robot. It didn't matter that the story was little more than an Outer Limits episode, it had what it took to be enjoyable. Now the same writer/director creates another minimalist movie, set in a near future Berlin that looks a lot like something out of the original Blade Runner and also with a few good actors like Alexander Skarsgård and Paul Rudd doing a fantastic job and also with a silly little story that didn't bring much to the table. Yet it didn't work.First of all, there is no reason why the story was set in the future. It also brought a lot of inconsistencies between the present and that future that could only be solved by some parallel world stuff that was never explained nor, again, required. Then the main character is an Amish mute man, played by Skarsgård. Does this bring anything to the story? Again, no. But worse than both those issues and worse than the pointlessly meandering plot that the viewer can't be bothered to care about is the ending. It brings everything to a close, yes, but in a way that no one is happy or interested in. The ending is utterly boring.Bottom line: It's Crash set into the near future, with euro actors and a boring finale. A decent effort, but ultimately a failure.",Mute
10,bowmanblue,There's a good film here (somewhere),6,20 March 2018,"Alas, poor Duncan Jones, I knew him well. I didn't. But I did really enjoy his first two sci-fi films 'Moon' and 'Source Code.' These were followed by the - sadly forgettable - big-budget 'Warcraft' movie and hopes were high when he returned to his (more low budget/high concept?) sci-fi roots. However, it's fair to say that this 'straight-to-Netflix' release has been met with 'divisive' responses - and by 'divisive' I mainly mean negative. I really wanted to like this, so I did my best to force the nay-sayers from my mind and enjoy the film. I wish I did enjoy the film. Don't get me wrong, it's not 'bad-bad,' it's just not that good either.It's set in the near future where technology is, er, slightly better than it is now. Actually, for its futuristic setting technology isn't really a big part of the story. An Amish man who doesn't speak due to a childhood accident travels from America to Berlin to meet up with his girlfriend, only for her to go missing in mysterious circumstances, setting him on a quest to find out what's happened to her.First of all the film does look great. I reckon it's pretty difficult to talk about this film without mentioning 'Bladerunner' as Ridley Scott's epic really did set the benchmark when it came to portraying dystopian, tech-driven cities of the future and 'Mute' seems to pay homage to this look and feel. I'm not sure of other people's complaints when it came to this movie, but my main issue was the fact that our hero never spoke. Yes, he's a good actor who does his best to express as many emotions as he can through his body language and facial expressions and for that he should definitely be applauded. I could have lived with that, if it wasn't for Paul Rudd's character. He plays a particularly sleazy villain who no one would ever really root for, if it wasn't for the face that he played his part so well and the hero never said a word. Therefore, having watched the film, I find myself finding the bad-guy far more memorable than the hero we were supposed to identify with and support.I guess there's a reason why 'Mute' was released 'straight-to-DVD' (or 'Netflix' in this day and age). The studio was obviously worried that it wouldn't make anywhere near the money back it needed to if given a theatrical release at the Box Office and I can understand why. It's hard to see 'Mute' getting enough attention in the cinema to make it a financial success. It's not a bad film and I guess you get what you pay for. I reckon the reviews would be even more harsh if the viewers had to pay 'full price' at the cinema in order to watch this. If you feel like investing two hours into a slow moving sci-fi film where the hero doesn't speak, leaving him wide open to being eclipsed by the man we're supposed to hate, then you're probably a minority. I didn't hate it, I'm just certain that Duncan Jones can do much better.",Mute
11,tomgillespie2002,There is a hint of a good movie buried in there somewhere,4,20 May 2018,"Shortly after he wowed cinema-going audiences with his independent debut feature Moon back in 2009, director Duncan Jones talked about his next project, a 'spiritual sequel' to his breakthrough film about a mute man searching for his lost love. Of course, this didn't exactly go to plan, as he followed Moon with the entertaining Source Code in 2011 and big-budget misfire Warcraft: The Beginning in 2016. Jones' stock had fallen, but strength of his debut meant that his next film would always invite interest. After years trying to get his idea onto the screen, Mute finally arrives on Netflix, the kind of platform that would allow Jones to follow through on his unique ideas without the pressure of having to please an audience who had just coughed up £10 to see the film.The result is a bigger disappointment than Warcraft, mainly because his 2016 effort already had the video-game adaptation stigma attached to it so expectations were understandably reserved. Mute is strange, but not in a good way. It spends over 2 hours telling two loosely connected stories which, when they finally cross over, will no doubt inspire ""is that it?"" reactions for those who try to remain patient with it. The film starts with an accident involving a young boy in the water. His Amish parents refuse to have the surgery that would allow him to speak, so the boy, named Leo, grows up physically scarred and unable to speak. Unfortunately for him, the technology of the future relies heavily on voice commands, so the imposing lug (played by Alexander Skarsgard) finds it difficult to connect to other people and his surroundings, all except his girlfriend, the beautiful and blue-haired Naadirah (Seyneb Saleh).A lot of time is spent developing their relationship as one of tenderness and genuine affection, but it is clear that Naadirah has a secret. This is the kind of the film where a character says ""I love you, but you don't know me,"" and keeps a straight face. One night, Leo shows up at the Berlin nightclub in which they both work, only to find her missing. Fearing the worst, the hulking mute sets about uncovering the truth for himself, encountering sleazy brothels and dangerous gangsters along with way. Meanwhile, disgraced American surgeon 'Cactus' Bill (Paul Rudd) runs a black market clinic for the criminal underworld, as he waits for the arrival of forged documents that will allow him and his young daughter to leave Germany. The shifty Bill, a melting pot of anger, bitterness and shame, clearly has something to hide, and so does his creepy friend Duck (Justin Theroux). Could it be related to Naddirah's disappearance?One of Mute's main issues is that it takes a hell of a long time to get going, taking a whole hour to reveal where it's taking you, and by which point you'll have likely lost interest. The stories of Leo's quest to find Naddirah and the illegal shenanigans of Bill and Duck feel like they belong in two completely different movies, with the tones differing so significantly that it disrupts the film's flow and atmosphere. Rudd, as a sort of evil version of his moustachioed Brian Fantana character from Anchorman, feels miscast at first before settling down and eventually stealing the film. The biggest disappointment of all is the sense of the world-building. This is a longtime passion project for Jones and the idea has likely lingered in his mind for years, but the world he has created feels shockingly hollow. It feels like an attempt to replicate Blade Runner, but it's really put to shame by last year's sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 masterpiece, and the visuals are so unengaging that they hinder the plot rather than moving it forward. There is a hint of a good movie buried in there somewhere, so this is precisely why I'll still go into Jones' next movie with high hopes.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Mute
12,eddie_baggins,A complete failure,1,26 February 2018,"In 2009 Duncan Jones released his debut film Moon. Moon was very good. Jones becomes a name to lookout for.In 2016 Duncan Jones released his long-gestating and troubled Warcraft adaptation, Warcraft was not very good and Jones finds himself with question marks hanging over his head.In February of 2018 Jones sees Netflix release his much-talked about new sci-fi Mute, a film that was spoken about as far back as Moon's 2009 release. Mute is sadly not good, in fact, Mute is so downright terrible and misguided, Jones's success with Moon is well and truly looking like a case of lightning only striking once for a filmmaker who seemed destined for great things.A personal film for Jones who dedicates the film to his late father David Bowie and his beloved nanny Marion Skene, it's hard to even know where to start when it comes to talking about how and why Mute is the mess it is but most tellingly and disappointingly is the fact that it stems from Jones as the writer and director of the project.After the extreme disappoint and letdown of The Cloverfield Paradox, Netflix would've been banking on Jones's supposed sci-fi/detective opus to showcase their wares as the distributer of fresh and exciting feature film content but Jones sometimes pretty yet mostly lifeless futuristic experience that coexists in the same universe of Moon is another original content failure by the streaming giant that makes one question the companies quality control measures.From the get-go something amiss seems to be afoot with Jones's film as we're introduced to Alexander Skarsgård's charisma free mute Amish lead Leo and his blue-haired girlfriend Naadirah and from the films odd and non-engaging opening things only get worse as this sci-fi/mystery begins to deviate frequently into a mess of ideas and components, none of which cohesively stick to make Jones's clunky narrative stick.Quite clearly inspired by the atheistic and world-building of sci-fi kingpin Blade Runner and other such futuristic noir's, Mute's two hour runtime is wasted on a collection of unlikeable and uninspired creations such as Paul Rudd's mutton chop sporting American doctor Cactus and ex-Mr Jennifer Aniston Justin Theroux as Cactus's creepy doctor friend Duck as Jones loses any chance of making his future version of Berlin a winner in a film that instead fails to capitalize on its potential to focus on a sleep-inducing plotline that could've been set at any time and place and makes its sci-fi roots almost entirely irrelevant.It's filmmaking at its most uninspired and cold, Jones showing none of the skill he delivered in Moon and to a lesser extent Source Code, while Mute's dire and often clunky script work makes you wonder if the filmmaker is far better off sticking to working on scripts written by others rather than ones written out of the goodness of his own heart and imagination.Final Say - Living up to its namesake, Mute has nothing of interest to say. With a confusing and pointless plot line, lifeless characters and a seemingly intriguing world that's largely ignored, Duncan Jones has delivered what will be one of 2018's most bitterly disappointing experiences and easily one of the year's worst films.½ a makeup clad Hobbit out of 5",Mute
13,southdavid,"Wordless Protagonist, artless script.",5,5 March 2018,"I wanted to like ""Mute"" so much. I'm a big fan of Duncan Jones as both a person and a filmmaker. I've enjoyed the cast in previous roles. I like science fiction stories. But try as I might, and for reasons I might struggle to explain below, I found myself disappointed and frustrated with the end product. Set in future Berlin, the film is the story of Leo (Alexander Skarsgard) who has been mute since a childhood accident damaged his vocal chords. Leo is in a relationship with the enigmatic Naadirah (Seyneb Saleh), a hostess at the club where he is a bartender. When she disappears one night, he begins to unravel more about her life before they met and seedy underbelly of the city they inhabit. Meanwhile, Cactus Bill, an American on the run from the army is trying utilise his underworld contacts and his medical skills, to purchase papers for him and his daughter to finally head back home. I guess, my real problem with the film is that it doesn't become what I wanted it to be following the first act. I was hoping that the film would evolve into a futuristic film noir, with Leo's investigation uncovering deeper corruption or surprising twists. . . but it doesn't really do that, or perhaps it would be better to say, it's not really as interesting in doing that, as I wanted it to be. It's quite slow moving too, at nearly two hours it could have done with around 30 minutes cut, especially as some of the subplots (the technological physical black market) for example, don't really go anywhere. My second issue with the film is the pairing of Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux as Cactus Bill and Duck. Clearly inspired by MASH with their vocal interplay during medical procedures. . Whilst both actors do well and are at times likable secondary characters, but as the more repulsive aspects of both their characters come to light, as the film progresses, it's a jarring let down rather than a plot surprise. I did enjoy the call backs to ""Moon"" and the reoccurrence of Sam Rockwell's character and I also liked Clint Mansell's score. Alexander Skarsgard gives a good performance, (though frankly... he should never smile in anything, ever). The world looks very nice, flying cars and neon advertising and the effects are good.. but somehow it feels a bit shallow, like we're never fully realising it. As much as I love Netflix, and the freedom that it's given artists to make the movies that they want to make, I am concerned about the trend this year of it becoming a dumping ground for projects that aren't quite working.",Mute
14,freemantle_uk,A messy sci-fi thriller,5,6 March 2021,"Mute was Duncan Jones' passion project and it was one of Netflix's big original films. It was considered a coup for Netflix to get a director like Duncan Jones. But it was a film that needed a better screenplay.Mute had great production design with Jones being influenced by the likes of Blade Runner and A Clockwork Orange and Jones did set up an interesting world, a world I wanted to see more of, like the wars America were involved in and why American soldiers were on the run.The issue of the film was the story. The focus was on Leo (Alexander Skarsgård) searching for his missing girlfriend in the Berlin underground. It's a solid if standard hook for a thriller but we can not get invested in his relationship for us to care about the search and Leo kept running into deadends. The storyline involving the two American medics who were stuck in Berlin and trying to find a way out was more interesting and should have been the base of the film.Whilst Mute had issues, it was harshly treated by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes was as low as 13% and it is currently on 21%. These are scores reversed for some of the worst big films and Mute doesn't deserve a score that low.",Mute
15,alindsay-al,An average artsy film,5,6 March 2018,"This film recently came onto Netflix and I had some interest in watching it and I have now seen mute and this film is a very forgettable film that I won't care about ever again. The premise of the film sees a mute bartender go on the hunt after his partner goes missing. Alexander skarsgard plays the lead in this film and he had a really tough job playing a silent character but I thought he did a fantastic job in this film. I truly rooted for his character through his body language and facial expressions, I cared about his character and his mission which I felt was the best part of this film. Paul rudd is in this film as a surgeon/gangster and he does a great job, he has his comedic qualities here but I was really surprised by some of his dramatic moments where he gave an intense performance that has proven his growth as an actor over the last few years. Justin theroux plays his best friend in this film and he was pretty good in the film, but there were times when I felt like he was over cooking his performance at times where he became really over the top and hard to take seriously. Everybody else in the film was hard to take seriously because of their over the top nature of the world and the characters that are shown. The story has two narrative threads which didn't really mesh particularly well, the main one being the main characters hunt for his missing partner which I really liked as I found it interesting and as mentioned before I supported skarsgards characters personal journey. Then there is rudd and therouxs story which didn't work as well with the only thing working being rudds great performance. Also the film drags on for 10-15 minutes too long and it really did hurt the film. The script has some decent humour from rudd which isn't much of a surprise, but I was disappointed how the dialogue was very bland in the dramatic quality for the supporting characters it made it really difficult to connect in the film. The style of the film isn't as good as it should have been, it is mixed tones. Half the film was noire crime thriller and half was a buddy cop film and I just really didn't like this mixture at. Also this films world isn't that interesting especially if you have seen blade runner 2049 which this film is heavily inspired by. Overall this is a very average film that is just there and not really worth to be seen.",Mute
16,Pairic,A Let Down.,6,25 February 2018,"Mute: I didn't think it was as bad as many critics make out, just not good. It dragged at times and was puzzling as to what was going on. Future-gangsterism Noir in a Blade Runneresque Berlin, set in 2060. A tale about a mute bartender (
Alexander Skarsgård) whose girlfriend (Seyneb Saleh) goes missing. They both work in a club whose mafiosi owner has links with underground surgeons, and e-identity fakers. Convincing performances by Skarsgård and Saleh but Paul Rudd doesn't convince as an on the run Army Medic who seems to do everything he can to call attention to himself.
 
I wouldn't damn it for being drab, I thought it was deliberate and (for some of the time) effective cinematography. I like flying cars but the ones here weren't used to good effect. If you direct a Blade Runner style noir future thriller it will inevitably be compared to the exemplar. The ongoing Afghan war in the background and US troops deserting was intriguing but also baffling. It might have improved the film if it had been more subtly integrated into the plot/script.Some great cinematography in softened, dark tones by Gary Shaw, with eye-catching art direction and set design by 
David Scheunemann and Bernhard Henrich. But this cannot compensate for the wooden direction by Duncan Jones and a chaotic screenplay by Jones and Michael Johnson. It's a pity this pet project of Duncan Jones has turned out to be such a let down. Anyway, I don't feel existential despair at giving up two hours to watch Mute but much as I wanted to like it I can only give it 5.5/10. On Netflix.",Mute

There are some nice cinematic touches here besides the Runner lift where Paul Rudd looks like a dead ringer for Elliot Gould in M.A.S.H.

18,peterp-450-298716,It's kind of quirky but not overwhelming.,5,9 April 2018,"""Why the hell can't he talk anyway?
It's complicated.
It's his mother's fault.
He needs surgery.
It's against her beliefs.""Fortunately, Alexander Skarsgård isn't by nature a voiceless person. It would have been a strange sight him appearing in ""The Legend of Tarzan"". Swinging around with his mouth wide open. But no sound that cuts through the jungle so everyone could hear that well-known primal cry. In ""Mute"" he's such a person with no sound leaving his mouth. And that because of a painful confrontation with the propeller of a motorboat (I suppose). What remains is a guy with the body of Tarzan and whose communication capacity is similar to that of Tarzan. Pretty flawed.Judging by the futuristic scenery, you'd expect a decent science fiction. It's situated in a fictional environment, namely future Berlin. The images remind you a lot of ""Blade Runner"". You'll see an enormous amount of neon lighting, holographic screens, futuristic vehicles flying around and a multitude of digital machines. Berlin is a screamy, noisy big city full of dark figures and practices. In this city, Leo (Alexander Skarsgård) is a barman of some nightclub where his blue-haired girlfriend Naadira (Seyneb Saleh) works as a waitress. A mysterious lady with a hitherto unspoken (no pun intended) secret. And the moment she wants to tell Leo about it, she suddenly disappears. And that's when Leo hangs his barman outfit on the coat rack and transforms into a futuristic, taciturn Sherlock.Are you expecting to see a ""Blade Runner""-like SF with runaway androids or artificial intelligent machines that want to conquer future society, you'll be slightly disappointed. The actual story in ""Mute"" is nothing more than a kind of detective story with some very bizarre twists and colorful figures. The two American doctors Leo is running into all the time, are a strange couple. Both their appearance (such as the walrus mustache of Paul Rudd and hawaiian shirts) and their names. Two doctors who listen to the names Cactus and Duck. Who made that up? And also these two surgeons work in an unhygienic looking cellar where they patch up members of the mafia (to obtain a passport to leave Germany). They look as if they've just worked in a field hospital during the Vietnam War. And lets not start about Duck's (Justin Theroux) perverse characteristic.To be honest, I found the moments these two weirdos turn up, the most interesting. On the one hand it felt rather comical. On the other hand, it was also quite controversial. It's kind of obvious both storylines of the physicians and that of the searching Leo would meet somewhere ultimately. But in the end, this is actually the least interesting part of the entire film. It's the framework and the way the movie is imaged that fascinates. The staging and characters form a colorful whole. The future prostitution network looks very otherworldly after seeing a person dressed up as a geisha (with smeared make-up), in a bizarre interior where two robots (with extreme-looking sex attributes) are displayed in an explicit way on the bed.Still, I was wondering if all those different stylistic interventions were necessary. Why did the main character have to be mute? Not just so they could justify the movie title? And why that futuristic appearance? Granted, if you leave out that part, there isn't much left to marvel at. And the most negative is the duration of the movie. That wouldn't matter, if there were more fascinating elements to see. Even though a few wellknown names played in it (And let's face it, Tarzan and Ant-man in one and the same film sounds awesome), I thought it was only a mediocre film. Perhaps Duncan Jones, son of the artistically gifted David Bowie, is stubbornly working on a quirky trajectory as a director. And just like his father, in the future this could bear fruit.",Mute

20,Troy_Campbell,"Ambitious and evocative, but also pretentious and impenetrable.",5,26 February 2018,"Netflix has been going all-in on original content over the last few years, but until recently that was primarily through long-form narrative shows (one story told over multiple episodes) and disposable Adam Sandler movies. The last six months has seen the streaming service giant make a big push into A-grade feature length work (Mudbound, Bright, Cloverfield Paradox, to name just a few), and this sprawling sci-fi is arguably their most intriguing prospect yet. With ambitious auteur Duncan Jones given free rein on what he has expressed as his passion project, having concocted the story with childhood friend and co-writer Michael Robert Johnson, there's zero chance of it being dull. And dull it most definitely isn't, the propulsive story-a man scours the grimy underbelly of a futuristic Berlin when his girlfriend goes missing-keeps the viewer on their toes whilst the gorgeous realisation of a Blade Runner-esque tech-future is a pure feast for thine eyes. But here's the catch: with a reluctance to explain almost anything about this world, or provide character motivation for anyone other than Alexander Skarsgård's silent bartender Leo, the plot can be complicated to the point of pretentious. There are a lot of little flourishes and subtle touches that colour this universe, although they would have meant so much more if the overall context was clearer. As it stands these unexplained moments become increasingly frustrating, threatening to derail the whole movie. His acting skills well and truly put to the test, Skarsgård is likable enough as the gentle giant on a mission; however, Paul Rudd is horribly miscast as a scumbag AWOL soldier, his persistent mean-spirited goading of others regularly veering into pantomime. There is clearly a lot of passion and ambition on display with Mute, but while for some it will be evocative and demanding, for others it will simply be pompous and impenetrable. For me it's somewhere in the middle with the scales tipping ever so slightly towards the latter.",Mute

23,rockman182,Mute (2018),6,3 March 2018,"I don't usually check out Netflix films as I've mentioned a million times before. I saw Mute on the list of newly released, heard bad things and didn't think twice. I then realized the film is by Duncan Jones. He is by no means my favorite director. Warcraft was a piece of unbearable crap but its the phenomenal Moon which made me want to check this out. Mute was also dubbed as a ""spiritual successor"" to Moon, so I was so in for it.The film is about a mute bartender whose girlfriend mysteriously disappears and his quest to find her. Entangled are a few curious characters including two surgeons who have their hands dirty and the owner of a club. The film is futuristic and set in a gritty world. Think Blade Runner. The film is actually really trying to emulate the feel of Blade Runner (even admitted by Jones himself). The film is no Blade Runner though; not close. I don't think its as bad as some people say it is but its still a forgettable sci fi film that falls flat.There's a bit of intrigue to the characters quest in finding his missing girlfriend. That intrigue dies fast though. There aren't really any likeable or identifiable characters and the film seems like a mishmash of a bunch of ideas that doesn't really work. The ending also isn't worth the entire 2+ hour running length. The world created by Jones is nice to look at, despite being reminiscent of many similar films that have come before.There is also a connection to Moon, although brief. Apparently, Jones is planning a loose trilogy. Mute isn't the worst sci-fi film I've seen or anything close. It's acceptable but not great. I find it problematic because its not a good follow up to something like Moon though, as that film was immensely superior. The plot and how it unfolds could definitely use re-working. Doesn't really offend me though, at the end of the day its a Netflix film so expectations are never high.5.5/10",Mute

I believe that the critics never understood what the movie was about, only seeing the negative and one of those is the similarities to Blade Runner but it's inspiration, with that he managed to create a story that's different. It's a good sci-fi thriller with the help of the storytelling and camera work. Sets and props is also something I believe they did perfectly.The ensemble cast has three actors that stand out, giving each a strong performance and they are Alexander Skarsgård, Justin Theroux and Paul Rudd. After seeing Paul Rudd in Ant Man I couldn't see him in a more serious and villainous way but after seeing him in this movie I'm honestly so wrong, his transformation is great and the performance he gave is just stunning and something that will catch your interest.",Mute

So how bad could it be, right? Let me count the ways. 1. Paul Rudd. His miscast character was all over the place, from over-confident madman to sneering killer to annoying gum chewer to loving father to...whatever. And he definitely could have done without that ridiculous squirrel tail mustache. 2. It was never explained how an Amish boy came to be a bartender in Berlin. I'd thought the Amish were unique to Pennsylvania and Iowa. I guess not. 3. What was his girlfriend's big secret, anyway? That she's a hooker or had a child out of wedlock? Big deal. That's as earth-shattering as snow in December. 4. The film made no secret of finding AWOL soldiers; yet, Paul Rudd, who was AWOL, was confronted by the military police and they DID NOT bring him in. Why? 5. That pedophile guy who restored the Mute's larynx? Why'd he go through all that trouble just to drag him to a bridge miles away to throw him off it? Why not kill him while you had his throat opened? At least the movie was purty, in a Blade Runner way.

26,kjproulx,A Sci-fi Flop,4,24 February 2018,"Science fiction films are always tricky to pull off, but if you have a good story on your hands, everything weak could possibly fade away. That being said, one of Netflix's most recent releases in Mute is an example of a film with a great setting, great premise, and great characters, that still manages to fall flat on its face. I was looking forward to this movie since I first heard the logline a few months ago, and seeing that Duncan Jones was at the helm as director only excited me more. There are aspects of this film to admire and praise once the credits roll, but the overall execution and where the story ends up was very messy. Here's why I think you should completely avoid this movie, unless you're just looking to get a kick out of a visual world, regardless of quality.After an accident when he was a kid, Leo was left without a voice. Now a bartender with a girlfriend, he's faced with incredible odds when she goes missing. Determined to find her, he goes up against the city's gangsters and worst criminals. That premise alone is what got me hooked and wanting to watch this film on day one of release. That being said, the way this film plays out is one of the most disappointing viewings I've had in quite some time. Picture a film like Blade Runner setting up the amazing world that it does, but not really having a compelling story or anything really to say to its audience. That's how I felt when watching Mute.When a movie sets up a premise, it's pretty fair that audiences should be expecting for the movie to deliver on its payoff. Mute doesn't exactly accomplish that because it relies too much on the side characters and derails itself from its core storyline. I found myself wondering why so much focus was being put on Paul Rudd's portrayal of Cactus and Justin Theroux's Duck. Alexander Skarsgård has been cast in so many properties, but never truly given a chance to shine. Sadly, I think this is the best performance he's ever given, which is a huge shame, due to the fact that this movie doesn't do it justice in any way. Aside from the way this movie plays out, there are a few things to commend here.As I said, I thought Skarsgård was stellar here and it's always nice to see Rudd in a dramatic performance. In terms of setting up this world, I thought director Duncan Jones did a great job. There are some pretty memorable sequences sprinkled throughout Mute and even some of the visuals are decent, but it still doesn't amount to much when many of these aspects are also negatives. A great scene means nothing if your overall movie is lacking and solid visuals in certain moments are worthless if others feel like they're from the 1990s. Quite honestly, Mute is the definition of a movie that tries very hard and fails miserably in its execution.In the end, Mute is commendable for many reasons. Honestly, I felt the same way about this movie that I did toward Warcraft. Duncan Jones has proven himself to be a very talented director with his work on either Source Code or Moon, but his blockbuster debut in Warcraft set up a nice world but didn't expand on it enough to really create any intrigue. Mute suffers from those exact same issues, making Jones a very hit-or-miss director now. Upon first glance, I would've called him a director to really look out for, but it seems like he's really trying to go big or go home these days. Mute is fine for a few isolated moments, but as a whole, it's very, very weak.",Mute
27,kuarinofu,Welcome to the future,8,16 October 2019,"I appreciate this movie being made. It feels like somebody's vision. I can definitely say so because it's full of stuff, both good and bad. While 90% of the movie is pure futuristic filth and depravity (mostly due to the setting), it had memorable and lighthearted moments sprinkled in.Talking about problems, I can definitely name structure, pacing and Leo (one of the leads, I guess). The ending was a little messy, Leo's arc didn't feel fully achieved (even though his smile indicated that), and overall throughout the movie he behaved like he had some sort of metal medical condition, not just being mute.Talking about the good stuff, I can definitely mention good sets, the ambience, lighting and overall look of the movie. Paul Rudd was great, it's a pity that his part in the Avengers is so small and his talent is not used properly.I also loved catching all the references to older movies and TV shows of which the movie is full.With all its flaws I found myself actually enjoying this, I was deeply immersed and I just wanted to observe this futuristic world and its people.It had a lot of potential, but overall it felt messy and unfocused.

33,MrDHWong,A disappointing misfire from an otherwise talented filmmaker.,4,8 March 2018,"Mute is a sci-fi thriller film starring Alexander Skarsgard and Paul Rudd. Directed and co-written by Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code), it is an unfortunate mess of a narrative and a disappointing misfire from an otherwise talented filmmaker.In the distant future, Leo (Alexander Skarsgard), a man whose vocal chords were permanently damaged in a childhood accident, works as a bartender in a Berlin strip club. One day, Leo's waitress girlfriend Naadirah mysteriously vanishes and he sets out to find where she could have disappeared.Despite a simple but intriguing premise, the plot of Mute feels convoluted and un-involving. The pacing is slow and the lead character is given very little development and the audience struggles to feel any sympathy toward him as he searches high and low for his girlfriend. The futuristic visuals are nice to look at and the CGI is serviceable, but is nothing that better films like Blade Runner 2049 have not done before and the whole cyberpunk setting ended up feeling gimmicky. The film doesn't borrow from the Blade Runner series as much as outright rip it off completely, and the story could have been set in modern day with current technology and there would be little difference. However, one of the few redeeming qualities was Paul Rudd's surprising performance as the film's main antagonist, a strong departure from the likeable goofballs he usually plays.I rate it 4/10",Mute
34,CANpatbuck3664,Slow Pacing and Weird Character Choices Handcuff Mute After a Promising Start,6,24 February 2018,"We're starting to get more movies and TV focused on futuristic noir. Blade Runner 2049 and Altered Carbon have just come down the pike and Mute joins that crowd. They all share a similar style, exposed neon colours and a creepy and dirty city to play around in. Mute doesn't reinvent the wheel, but they change enough to show off an interesting style. I enjoyed Mute's cinematography and environments even though it shares this vision with movies like Blade Runner. This was needed too, when you're starting to drift from Leo and Bill's adventures, they bring in some new trick or piece of technology to move things along.Despite the negative reviews, the one positive things I heard before turning Mute on was Paul Rudd's performance as Cactus Bill. I have to agree, Rudd actually makes for a compelling villain and this is a big departure from Ant-Man. His performance is noteworthy, and it was a good reminder what he's capable of. Alexander Skarsgård is fine as Leo, he's just not given a lot to work with. He's an underrated actor but he's kneecapped by his character. Seyneb Saleh is good in her part as Naadirah. She's sultry yet reserved and she performs as capably as she can. Justin Theroux is suitably slimy as Donald, he has a good interplay with Rudd and that again helps the movie along. I don't approve of what they do with his character, it just comes across as gross and then they never bring it up again.Netflix is becoming a place for filmmakers to explore their dream projects. I approve of that and we as moviegoers need more unique stuff as many things are just becoming more and more formulaic. But this idea is a double-edged sword, while its good that we get unconventional content, the flip-side is that there is no one there to rein the creative team in when things go array. My biggest problem with Mute isn't that it was long, it was that the pacing of this movie can be compared to how fast a glacier floats. We have an interesting setting and mildly interesting characters, but the movie just aimlessly wanders like Leo when he's looking for Naadirah. Maybe it would have been a little cliche but this would have been so much better if they had made some minor edits to the story and made Mute take place over 1 night. We spend entire nights with Leo where he makes little to no progress and then we watch him wake up and try all over again. It's not like he makes a ton of gradual progress, the plot shifts on his very quick realizations so why couldn't this have been tightened down? I don't necessarily need a ton of action, but our main character is a blank slate other than knowing a little about his background, the movie needed something other than the acting and the cool environments to coast on.I've already talked about how Mute's plot needed to be tightened up and have some added urgency but the other crime that this movie commits is that it loses any leftover goodwill with its unusual conclusion. A lot of things can be forgiven with a strong and exciting resolution and if you have the choice between starting strong and finishing strong, go with the strong finish. Instead of ramping up the stakes, the movie dives into becoming weirder and more contemplative. Characters make choices for no other reason than to propel the story, they aren't realistic, and you can tell that they're going to come back and bite them immediately. Mute needed to desperately pull a rabbit out of its hat to keep me interested over the long run time and while the film features a plot twist, it wasn't nearly enough, and the ending left me nonplussed and frustrated.With the absolute beating this movie took from the critics, I thought I was in for a train wreck. But I was actually pretty impressed with this movie after the first 30 minutes. They assembled a good cast; the environment is fun to look at and they set up a decent mystery. It was only when I got past the first hour that the pacing, the weird character motivations and the meandering nature of the story started to get to me. I've enjoyed Duncan Jones' past work and I'm glad he got to make this. But Mute is far from must-see cinema, if you really like stuff like Blade Runner and are big into science fiction, this might be worth your time. Otherwise, Mute is another mixed bag from Netflix as they try to jump start making blockbuster entertainment.",Mute

39,PyroSikTh,How this was a Passion Project I will never know,4,24 February 2018,"Mute follows an Amish bartender in the future. He can't talk thanks to a boating accident as a child, and being Amish he has been sheltered from the advancements of technology. He falls enough with a mysterious waitress who holds a secret, and ultimately goes missing, setting the Bartender out on a warpath to find her. Interspliced between this is the story of a US soldier gone AWOL trying to get back home with his daughter, and as a result getting wrapped up in the criminal underworld with his paedophilic best friend.Unfortunately, everything I've just mentioned is completely unrelated to one another. The core story of a mute bartender tracking down his missing girlfriend is a solid story. It kept me reasonably entertained throughout and held a lot of promise. Unfortunately the fact it's set in the future has absolutely no impact whatsoever. It could've been set in the present day and played out exactly the same way. Similarly, the bartender being mute and having an aversion to technology is also never utilised. He could've spoken from the offset and used all manner of bizarre gadgetry, and the story would still have played out the exact same way. It's like Jones had a really interesting concept, but no story to fill it with, or maybe he had the interesting story, and just chucked a load of half-baked ideas at it to make it more unique. Either way none of it's interesting concept have any bearing on the story at all.Similarly the subplots of the AWOL soldiers meander around aimlessly until the last half an hour where the (admittedly pretty good) revelation comes in. Before that they also serve no purpose other than to detract and slow down the main story. They reference the bartender's girlfriend as well, but there are no hints or clues as to why they even know her, let alone enough to talk about her and the bartender's search for her, or why the whole thing is important to them. Why? To keep the big twist intact I guess. His best friends paedophillia is made a big thing of as well, to absolutely no end (or at least, no important end), making the whole subplot around them completely and utterly pointless.That said, Paul Rudd is fantastic as the AWOL soldier. Ironically if I did watch this movie again, it would be for Paul Rudd and his pointless meandering around Berlin. He manages to toe a careful line between serious and amusing, charming and threatening, psycho and loving. His confrontation with his peadophilic friend is definitely the highlight of the entire movie because his really good performance behind it. Justin Theroux, as the paedophilic friend, is pretty good as well, but his character is mired by completely nonsense decision making like helping the bartender out despite being against him, giving the bartender a voicebox before killing him, and not just leaving his friend to die, but torturing him by taking his daughter. I have no idea why Duck would do anything he did.On the flipside Alexander Skarsgard was a blank slate throughout, not really knowing how to express without dialogue. He's reduced to a brooding tough guy with puppy dog eyes and those are his only two expressions; sad and sorry, and aggressive and protective. I feel like I know nothing about his character at all. Similarly Seyneb Saleh who plays the girlfriend simply could not deliver her lines convincingly in her small amount of screen time. How their love story at the beginning was so charming and endearing with such lacklustre performances behind them I have no idea. Cameo appearances by Dominic Monaghan and Robert Sheehan were really good though, and Sam Rockwell reprising his role as Sam Bell from Moon was a big plus for shared universe world-building. Unfortunately I think I'd rather have seen a straight-up sequel to Moon, with the Sam Bell clones fighting in court against Lunar Industries.I wouldn't go so far as to say Mute is a complete trainwreck. It still has some really great moments and it's full of good ideas. Unfortunately those good ideas are never utilised or reach their potential, and the main story is brought down by pointless subplots. It's too long with too much going on, and yet nothing really happens. Watch it for Paul Rudd, the Rockabye Baby cover of Heart-Shaped Box, and the oddly endearing love story at the beginning. Other than that it's not worth wasting your time with unfortunately (yes, for once I actually agree with the critical lashing it's getting). I give Mute an underwhelming 4/10.",Mute
40,W011y4m5,Worst movie of all time?,1,6 April 2019,"Words cannot actually describe how much I loathe & detest this movie - few films I've ever seen have actually earned my revulsion & hatred but ""Mute"" is deserving of it; its offensive, voyeuristic depiction of what is essentially child abuse & the attempted (whether intentional or not) normalisation of pedophilia genuinely turns your stomach & fills you with anger... I'm genuinely bemused how any parent on set allowed their child to be treated in such a perverse manner - if they were to have witnessed the camera angles the crew were shooting from etc.
Tackling tricky subject matter is not the issue here at all - but if you're to depict something heinous, all I ask or expect is that you depict it as it is - heinous & not as something which can easily be forgiven & not taken seriously...
Media has the power to influence people's perceptions & when a character notices his friend's abnormal & inappropriate behaviour & attractions towards children, I'm astonished how the scene where this plays out fails to convey or acknowledge & understand the seriousness of his actions - for the following scene is immediately disregarding his crimes, as if they're of no importance to consider...
Even if this was accidental or due to careless writing / editing, the message it conveys is unforgivable.
Moreover, even if Duncan Jones somehow managed to fix this vulgar, tasteless mess of a project - he'd still be left with an incoherent, nonsensical story that makes no sense whatsoever - has terrible cinematography with cheap looking visuals, bad performances & shockingly poor portrayals / depictions of women.",Mute
41,tesswysko,I don't know what I even watched!,5,26 April 2019,"While I would normally praise Paul Rudd for stretching his acting muscles and trying something different, I am completely at a loss about why he took a role in this movie! This movie it is like someone saw blade runner and decided they were going to replicate it and throw in a bunch of mobsters, who I have no idea how they're even really relevant, a family of sick sorts, a mute man with a heart of gold who's in love with a woman who can't be true to him, a couple surgeons who have extreme perversions and the movie takes that all, throws it in a yahtzee Tumblr shakes it up and rolls out a movie!
I'm having a hard time coming up with my positives and negatives because there was just so much going on in the movie. The man falls in love with this woman and she tells him that there's something that she has to tell him and he asks if she's going to leave him and she says no and he says that nothing else matters, and the next thing he knows she leaves him. This starts a journey and brings in a bunch of mobsters that he's trying to find out where she is and it ends up with him finding out about somebody owing money to somebody and they give him the money and he has to take it to the next person and it's just so confusing! I guess the acting is good it's just the script that is awful. I do not like Paul Rudd in this and it's not that he's a bad actor, it's just not the type of role for him. You know if you wants to play The Straight Guy instead of a comedic role that's fine but this guy was just evil. And he was mean, it just did not work on him. Skarsgard was incredible! He made me fall in love with him with his soft gentle ways! I could not imagine why the woman didn't come back to him until the very end when the truth of everything is completely revealed and then I find out her reasoning and it all makes perfect sense. Which in the movie you don't want to know all the truth until the end it makes for a good movie, but you didn't even get the slightest idea of anything, the movie was just bizarre! So I'm not going to say watch it or don't watch it, I'm just not really sure at this point. I think I have to let it sink in a little further.",Mute
42,ritera1,Surprisingly disappointed by very good director,4,27 February 2018,"Duncan Jones had done some great work in Moon. Then did some very good work in Source Code. Even Warcraft was fun and much better than what the reviews and box office said.But Mute is self-absorbed praddle.The story is essentially he has to find she, his love. But there was no chemistry or common sense between the two. We're just told they're in love and suppose to accept that.Then the requisite lead-up to her disappearance that eventually made no sense as she was taken vs. disappeared, which was portrayed just beforehand as she has to leave...for some reason.Then we're subjected to a very slow slog through a future world that was somewhat amusing for about 10 minutes. But that ten minutes was about 90 minutes.There was some interesting elements. Skarsgård being Amish vs. a tech-heavy future was intriguing but was nothing other than something to slow him down. There was no reason for his character to be with his ""love"" due to his beliefs.Much of the film was a desperate attempt to create urgency and peril. The gangster element vs. Skarsgård's character was thin at best. Paul Rudd's menacing psycho was amusing but him being the woman's ex-husband was anti-climatic and vague. Apparently she was saving money to get her daughter back but her murder was buried in an undefined threat to Rudd's custody.And as I have to assume yet again (as it was all vague) the intent of the third act when we find out Justin Theroux's friend/hate psychotic relationship with Paul Rudd's character. First he puts Skarsgård on Rudd's trail. Then when Rudd's character is killed, he's mad at Skarsgård for killing Rudd in an extended hike through restoring his voice, just to apologize.At that point, though, I didn't give a crap.",Mute
43,dallasryan,The Acting was Really Good,6,12 June 2018,"Mute was all over the place. The story is muddled and there is a certain disturbing essence to the movie all around. The look of the film is interesting, but still looks as if they're on the Warner Brothers lot. The good thing about this film was the acting. Alexander Skarsgård is terrific, and very likable as the Mute. Paul Rudd is excellent as the mean and bitter man who wants to go home. I have never seen Rudd play a part like this as he was mean and menacing. Rudd proves he's a great actor. Justin Theroux plays the borderline pedophile friend almost too well, a real creepy part which makes this film that much more disturbing. The problem I had most with the film was the fact that Skarsgård is a very likable good guy, but he's only in 50% of the film. The other 50% of the film you have to watch the two unlikable characters that Rudd and Theroux play and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I would liked to have seen 20% of Rudd and Theroux and 80% of Skarsgård. However, the film does end well and sometimes how you end is what matters. It's a sad film, it's a disturbing film, it's a muddled film, but the acting is terrific and is worth watching for the acting.",Mute
44,pranayjalvi,Another Let down by Duncan Jones,5,24 February 2018,"Duncan Jones, who started his career with movies like Moon and Source Code lost his way with Warcraft and same happened in the case of his new feature 'Mute'. The plot was weak and confusing and nothing so pleasing to watch. The only good thing in the movie was the visual effects and the background score. A tight screenplay and a better direction would have made 'Mute' a much better movie to watch.My Rating : 2.5/5",Mute
45,FallenEye,Sounded Good.,5,26 April 2018,"For a film that was so sedate, and moving at one hell of a snail's pace, Leo sure did make quick work of Cactus. Also, the area in which the knife was planted in Cactus, was quite poetic.Speaking of Cactus, Paul Rudd stole the show. Let down only by this movie's inability to enkindle interest, Paul was pretty superb as a villain. He was funny, he was cruel and he was engaging. Alexander Skarsgard was also good. He, at many points, or at least enough, prompted a sense of compassion from the viewer. And Mia and Lea as Josie, they were too adorable, though one twin is more adorable than the other.Mute ran 30 minutes too long, and because of how long it already felt, one is tempted to say it ran an hour too long. Twists are great, but if they're propelled by a story that refuses to start, then all you have is a twist of something that's going nowhere slowly.Duck's little psycho episode at the end, that dragged way, way longer than it needed to, felt as if the director/story writer didn't know how to have Duck condemned for his actions. In fact, that's exactly what it was, and so it all played out like a blender without a lid.And since they saw it fit to call this movie Mute, what exactly was the point of Leo being Mute? This movie would've played out no differently if it were called Loud, and Leo as a character was the type who never shut up. Anyway, the production design and costume design was pretty good actually. 4.9/10.",Mute

47,quaseprovisorio,it has a heart somewhere but it's a huge convulted mess.,4,17 May 2020,"What's this movie about: a disappeareance of a woman in a futuristic berlin. not what this movie is really about? good question. i wanted to know. it is about a place to belong? it's about the loneliness in the city? it' about the secrets everyone keep? i don't know. the movie wants to be something highly philosphical, a huge drama about a man and his place in the world - i guess. it wants to be populated with this ""weird"" characters from the future in a berlin where americans are persecuted easily if they don't follow the rules.but which characters work? probably none. our mute hero could work: if the movie was more interested on a simpler plot and didn't want to be populated with characters that at the end of the day didn't matter. but we know close to 0 about him: we know he is mute due to an incident in the water as a child. we know he's not a fan of technology and his house is all retro...but that's it. we know 0 about his family friends, past dramas besides that one. he's a shallow hero. the same for theroux and rudd characters (heck one of the biggest characterization of theroux is too disturbing unnecessary to be honest). rudd...well hdo he really know enough of him? i don't think so. he was also kinda miscasted, him and theroux could have changed parts. but that's not a major issue when we look at the bigger picture.the visuals are cool i'll give duncan jones that. jeez i loved moon and source code...i wanted to enjoy this movie and shut those critics. but i can't. a lot of characters could be dispensed, a lot of scenes could just be thrown away because they don't mean anything, most of the dialogues are dull, the way he conducts his investigation about her could be have been done differently with different approaches to the clues he got. some of the actions are not well explained either. we don't understand those characters.in terms of pace, the movie starts well but then it feels flat when it wants to be something else besides a disappearance investigation. that's the biggest sin of this film: it wanted to be so many things at the same time that doesn't want to chose none of them. duncan jones should have check more often his storyline to remind himself what type of story he really wanted here - because i think he forgot along the way. the movie should have spent more time with the mute hero than it did.redeeming things? the visuals by far. they don't work always but they're cool. the music is also not bad. the mute hero is not boring even though is not well thought as a character. that's it. i wanted to give an higher grade: i can't. maybe one day i'll have the patience to review this, i'm going to try to find some material where jones talks about what he wanted this to be. for now: it's something that wanted to be meaningful but the plot feels shor, the characters feel short, the dialogues aren't good enough. sorry. i'm till hopeful for the next movie of this guy.",Mute
48,tfminfl,201. Mute,9,24 February 2018,"201. Mute. Another great sci fi movie released on Netflix. From writer/director Duncan Jones, who also did the Sam Rockwell movie Moon, which was awesome! But the cooler part of that is, the story of Mute takes place within the same universe as Moon, Sam Rockwell's character Sam Bell makes an appearance!! Anyways back to this cool flick... So we got this guy named Leo and due to an accident as a child, ya know little kids goofing around getting their throats slashed by boat engines, ooops. And the bigger bummer to this is, he's from an Amish family, and instead of just getting his throat repaired by the tech of the future, they leave it up to God, and surprise, it does nothing, but causes him to be a...?? Anyone?? A mute. (Even in the future, religion rules the stupid) Fast forward 30 years now he's Alexander Skarsgard and a bartender with a hot girlfriend, Naadirah, a waitress at the same club Leo works, and after a scuffle with a few patrons she disappears. And Leo goes looking for her. And shes not exactly the person he thought she was, and this leads him down a dark path to the truth. It was a pretty dark tale with a pretty satisfying ending. Sci fi gangsters galore and Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux pop up in here as two very foul gentleman. It was a really cool mystery thriller, with some very good performances... Anybody who loves the world of Blade Runner and more recently Altered Carbon would probably love this flick.",Mute
49,Lewis_Heather787,Great Concept but its lacking quite a lot !,6,23 February 2018,"When I heard that the director of ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" is doing a noir, futuristic, sci-fi, Blade Runner esque film as his next project expectations are relatively good. However I have absolutely no idea where to start with this film because it is definitely not what I expected. Let's start with some positives, Firstly the directing from Duncan Jones is good from start to finish. Throughout the film now and then there are some great long panning shots that show the setting of the film extremely well. Apart from that its not mind blowing but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the directing. The cinematography of the film as well is very good, the film can look very dark and dire but then in a split second change into a wonderful amount of vibrant colour. Very nice contrast and makes the world of the film look very much lived in as if all of the surrounding buildings have got history to them.The cast is an interesting bunch to be honest and all of them for the most part are good with what they are given to do. Obviously the standout is Alexander Skarsgard, who is very good as the mute bartender Leo, he is the heart beat of the film and he carries the film along well. Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux are both good in their respective weird roles that are extremely strange, but they do the best they can. The rest of the cast is all ok its just the three mentioned are slightly better.No unfortunately lets move onto the negatives of the film, firstly lets start with the story of the film which is..........well.......boring, unoriginal and overcomplicated. It's nothing new in a film to see a couple separated and one of the them goes missing, which makes the other begin a search for them. Unfortunately I did not care about the main two characters at all, I couldn't care less to be honest. That is because we are introduced to them and then 10-15 minutes later the girlfriend is missing, limited backstory. 
The film then decides to go on this extremely long and extremely slow journey across the city of Berlin with Leo to find the love of his life. I'm sorry but it is nice to look at don't get me wrong but its just really dull and uneventful. Yes the film picks up a little once us as the audience is shown what happens to missing girlfriend, apart from that nothing really happens just a lot of boring investigating. Another issue with the film is that it tries to touch on big subject matters with Justin Theroux's character and others. It just doesn't work because the basics of the film don't work like a interesting main story. The films tries to go down some really weird avenues with some characters that just feel misplaced in this film.Oh yeah before I forget the film ""Moon"" and this are now connected which at first was really cool to see Sam Rockwell on the TV screens. However I think its very insulting on the greatness of the film ""Moon"" to reference it and connect them. This film doesn't deserve that!!Overall though and strangely I think this film is ok 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out of 10, you might be thinking ""wait a minute you just talked negatively a lot about this film"". The answer to that is yes I did, however I believe that there is a great concept for a film here I just feel as if it was created and directing by the wrong person. I believe a more established director such as Christopher Nolan, David Fincher or Denis Villeneuve would have done a better job with the source material and screenplay. Another thing to add is that the ending of the film is actually the best part of the film and ties up everything quite nicely really. Its disappointing but is ok/average!",Mute

There is this mennonite boy who has a bad accident and then is an adult male tending bar in a raunchy night club and has these decent fight skills who is that boy, this all occurs in a very short time, and if U find this confusing, then I suggest U not watch the movie, cause that is the dip stick for your interest.Throw in a blade runner atmosphere and U can roll with it. Acting is a let down for some characters, basically wanna be actors trying to be their characters but not really getting it, especially some of the guy characters. The primary protagonist did a good job, however, some of that was due to the atmosphere created around him.Some kinky scenes, back to the blade runner thing, but with poor acting for some characters.The protagonist with no character build up gives us the futuristic city tour with his 'investigation'.

51,peeedeee-94281,Mute...Doesn't Have Much To Say,4,23 April 2019,"I had high hopes seeing that this was from the same director who gave us Moon and Source Code. Sadly this movie is not like either, and probably explains why it went to Netflix instead of the theaters.
The main problem with this movie is why have a person who is Mute and Amish? I mean, what purpose did it serve for the film. You think there would be something during the course of the film that would be like 'aha! that's why those qualities were necessary for the main character!'. But none of it pays off.
The movie also doesn't seem to have a focus. At first it's a missing persons, then its about the seedy underworld, then it's about one guy trying to get a passport to leave Germany, then it's a something else. The original story keeps getting lost in the side stories. In the end, you don't even really care whether the 'mute' finds his loved one. It doesn't even seem realistic why he would be in love with someone like that, there isn't much chemistry between the two. Alexander Sarsgaard just wanders around like frankenstein's monster, with no real explanation about weird habits or behaviors.
Just when you think it's over, because you find out what happened, it still keeps going, for another 15 or 20 minutes.
Ultimately, Mute is a movie that is overly long, with not much happening for long periods of time, and a main character that is unsympathetic. There is also a miscast heavy in Paul Rudd. It's hard to figure out if you should hate him or not. But that's not a good thing, because you just never figure out what's the point of anything in the film.",Mute

I was so conditioned by what I read that I didn't expect anything good. And I postponed watching for so long that when I finally came to see this I had even forgotten who was the Author.So, if you already watched this, you can imagine how surprised I was: I feared to have condemned my self to watch something lame, built on a low (economic and creative) budget, with some kind of stupid plot bugged by annoying logical holes and so on... but this film isn't anything like that.It's a good movie (Duncan Jones is the Author) set in a visually interesting future and built on a good story.

The premise sounded interesting, plus it was directed by Duncan Jones. He made an outstanding film called Moon a few years ago that I loved. Plus he is David Bowie's son
 Unfortunately this movie fell flat.I'll start with the things I liked about it. I love the futuristic cyberpunk setting. It had a very Blade Runner feel to it. Animation and design-wise the movie was solid all around. I also really enjoyed the beginning of the movie. The initial setup showed quite a bit of promise. A revenge mystery about a man searching for his girlfriend slowly descendants into the underbelly of a futuristic world gone wrong. Great start with a lot of promise.Unfortunately everything fell apart after that. The pacing was slow to the point of being tedious. The middle was far too drawn out and the finale too rushed. There was zero suspense or Intrigue regarding the grand mystery of his girlfriends fate. And the great twist at the end completely fell flat. It seems like the director really wanted to make a Park Chan-wook level revenge tragedy, but just didn't have the material or skill to do so.The characters were also all around terrible. There wasn't a single character that I really enjoyed. This of course being disappointing as I do like Paul Rudd and Alexander Skarsgard. Both characters again had interesting introductions, but neither were developed properly. Unfortunately the material just didn't work for either character.At the end of the day this was a huge let down. The movie was a complete mess. I really had high hopes for this director, but it looks like he may just have gotten lucky with his first film. A 5 out of 10.",Mute
55,js-66130,CRAP,2,20 April 2020,"One of life's mysteries: how an obviously gifted director can follow a genuine cinematic touchdown (""Moon"") with a sloppy fumble (""Mute""). Adding coarse sea salt to the wound, this draggy debacle is supposed to be part two of an (formerly) eagerly anticipated triplet. Abort!Duncan Jones, son of Bowie no less, created a deliriously enthralling film, a Sci-Fi mystery of an inner journey in outer space, sprinkled with comedic bites. This is not that movie. This is the unfortunate follow up. Here Jones mashes ""M*A*S*H"" with ""Blade Runner"", leaning on a scruffy Paul Rudd (usually big screen money) for eye-winking levity. Sounds promising right?""Mute"" feels like three, four, or maybe twelve movies in one. There's just too much going on, and none of it is really any good, or at least developed to a point of engagement. The plot opens with Alexander Skarsgard as a gentle giant Amish mute tending bar in a strip club, reluctantly sucked into a dangerous underworld because of, wait for it, love. Not a great start but fair enough, even the most lazy and improbable of story line can produce passable crap. Yet Jones starts suffocating his artsy attempt with increasing layers of plot, that by the film's ridiculous finale, when our mute is revisited, introductions are in order.Adding to the confusion is Paul Rudd as Cactus Bill, the AWOL American surgeon in Berlin (huh?) killing an Elliott Gould porn stash, smacking bubble gum, striking a weird imbalance of quirky and creepy. Yes, Cactus Bill! You can't make this stuff up. Well, you can, and, they did.Followers of futuristic worlds of fantasy will be crushed, as the sets are hackneyed forgettable, and the ideas banal. Neon signs! The future should be to be either awesome cool, or dystopian weird, not dishevelled boring or inconsistently drab.About as baffling a movie streaming experience as possible, and way too long to boot, there is absolutely no saving this horrific, frustrating mess.

The Amish thing just seemed like a gimmick to use an excuse for Leo to not get the vocal surgery, and other than it being a cool idea, it didn't seem to be particularly relevant that he was Amish. They just sort of glazed over this part of his life as a child. Then about an hour into the story they bring up that he's carving a bed for his girlfriend, to make women oh and ah that he's a carpenter, but other than that, still not much reason for him to be Amish other than the writer thought it would be cool for him to have an old fashioned apartment, which, having lived near Amish country can tell you his apartment and clothes were not up to religious code.I understood the story, though, you really had to pay attention to keep up and dissect what the writer was trying to convey. This became a bit of work when the story moved along fairly slowly and the writer sort of jumped around from the characters of Leo to Cactus.

Mute is a type of sci-fi movie noir which is being unfairly compared to Blade Runner. There are some similarities in terms of the setting but how many movies have the budget of Blade Runner?
Duncan Jones makes middle to low budget intelligent sci-fi and this fits the bill perfectly.
The reason this movie has been voted down is because the people who do not like this movie are not the intended audience. If you prefer only Hollywood movies where you can tell the good from the bad and find comfort in familiar stories where you can guess the outcome for every actor then this simply isnt for you.
This is far too dark a story for a mainstream audience, they may be sucked in by seeing Paul Rudd in the movie however this is not a Paul Rudd you have ever seen before. The film is laced with very dark humour and has some very dark undertones and offers a bleak view of the future.

It is in 'the style' of, but does not rise to the level of ""Blade Runner"". It's ambitious, long, not a simple plot (that could justifiably be accused of being overly meticulous) with a few twists and turns and plenty of nifty ideas.
Paul Rudd strives mightily against type and Justin Theroux went on my map.
I'm at odds with the criticisms. Emulating or being inspired/influenced by ""Blade Runner"" is a bad thing? 
Part of the glory of ""Blade Runner"" was that film tech had finally reached the point of being able to create those worlds that readers of sci-fi had only been able to carry around in their heads. Every world created by a visionary is going to inspire emulation of some kind, for better and worse.

English became the de facto language, and Germany seems to be somehow occupied by American forces once again. There is not a lot of law enforcement going on (a little girl can come and go from whorehouses, violence goes unreported, littering and vandalism is rampant). On top of that apparently (for reasons not clear) the Amish come back from America to Germany (a country they left 300 years ago). The only reason I can imagine why is because of some sort of draft, because why would they move to a place so disfunctional and full of sin?There are no Euros anymore, hinting that EU is dead (Karl Marx and Angela Merkel's faces are on the 500 and 100 Deutsche Mark bills).

Mute follows the story of Leo Beiler (Alexander Skarsgård) who is a mute bartender who goes in search for his missing girlfriend (Nadiraah- played by Seyneb Saleh) and Skarsgård is probably the only good thing about the whole movie. The story is set 40 years into the future in Berlin, which is filled with immigrants where all cultures collide. I had read somewhere that the film took the makers 10 odd years to complete and the end product did leave you with a lot of questions and 'meh' moments.Paul Rudd , too put in a pretty good shift as one of the two cocky American surgeons who makes quick bucks by sewing up mob henchmen who get injured in 'the line of duty'. The first few minutes were intriguing and as the story evolved I was left wondering what the end game was. The plot is predictable, dialogues uninteresting and the premises an odd juxtaposition of retro cars, contemporary technologies in a modern/old city ! I did want to like this movie but truth be told, it never ever lived up to the expectation and barring the stellar performance put in by Skarsgård , I might not have survived the 2 hour ordeal.",Mute
70,fxdx4,A Bazar Intriguing Mess,6,21 December 2018,"It is shocking how muddled and confusing a trope revenge film can get.Let's start with this... A mute Amish bartender/carpenter is living in a futurist Germany... huuu??!!! And none of these details have a single significance to the actual story. This is what is good and frustrating about Mute.When is girlfriend (likely?) disappears, he must find her. OK, but there is also this side plot about Cactus (Rudd) who is a AWAL surgeon working for some sort of criminal organization. Ohh and Justin Theroux is in it too.This film, as said by Shakespeare, is both equal part poison and medicine power. Duncan Jones the director of Mute clearly is having fun, and the characters are brought to life by shockingly good performances all around. In fact, after understanding that Rudd was not doing a terrible job acting, I realized it is in fact my favorite performance by him - ever! He picks character and mood over plot at every turn, and has a fun time doing it. The character interactions are what make this film go, and if you do not enjoy the Cohenesque conversations of the main characters, than this is for sure not for you.Thematically, Jones does a very good job of bending relationships and understanding what is important in a relationship. Labels are shuffled and left at the door. Sex and sexuality is examined in unique and often unique ways. The core of this is the relationship between Rudd and Theroux which is at the same time confusing, over the top, touching and hilarious. Their relationship is one of the most engaging, humorous and over the top/subtle I have seen on film. But I can see how many people would be frustrated and bored with their banter.Without this (actually in spite of this) the film is a total mess - it's also way too long, dragging badly in the final 1/3 of the film. I'm not sure what is happening most of the time or why, and all the acting and character of the film can't save the actual story from being tired and hard to follow.You will watch this film if you are a fan of film, Rudd, subversion and quirk. You should not watch this film if you care about plot, cohesion, action or think Rudd is over that top.I can't say Mute is good, but there are some parts that are exceptionally good.",Mute

73,aquascape,A stylish original sci-fi from Netflix,8,27 March 2018,"The long awaited original film from Duncan Jones, ""Mute"" serves as an anger driven film using as device a kidnapping scene in a Blade Runner-type dystopian universe.The first thing you will see is the stylish and glamorous visual effects and neon lighting of a potentially good neo-noir science fiction movie and being helmed by Jones, credited for ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"", what could go wrong? Personally, if the plot if followed from start to finish, it will turn out to be a good entry in the science fiction library.The story revolves around a mute bartender in Germany who's girlfriend is kidnapped by an unknown man. The mute is played brilliantly by Alexander Skarsgård, who looked genuinely humble as a person who couldn't utter a word. 
The movie has two narrative strings, the other one involving Paul Rudd as a surgeon who has tried and failed many times to go back home to the US and his friend Justin Theroux, both playing tremendously well, with points for Rudd who plays against character type as the villain.
Towards the end the narration becomes linear and it's conclusion left myself satisfied, to say the least.""Mute"" is a Netflix original film, but did not have that Netflix feeling to it and I think it's one film that stands out from their catalog so far.Stunning visuals, great acting, good direction and writing from Jones.
It's not the greatest, it not by far the worst, but it's a very good attempt at an original film and originality is something that is lacking these days.",Mute
74,LorenBieg,Great acting not enough to make Mute sing...,4,27 February 2018,"I'm an easy sell on an intriguing Sci-Fi premise and Mute has one. A man without speech in a futuristic murder mystery? So much potential. Unfortunately, that potential is wasted in this failed script, despite some really enjoyable acting.I have several rants about this film. First, there is no reason whatsoever for this story to take place in the future. There's nothing sci-fi about it except that it happens to take place in a time where futuristic cars and food vending machines exist. Other than that, it could take place in 1925, or 1975, or now. Why put it in the future if nothing about the story requires it. I'm no executive producer, but it seems like a waste of effects budget when present day locations would work just fine.There is no significance to the muteness of the protagonist in Mute. This one is almost criminal. What a great and compelling idea to have a hero who can't speak! Besides some nods to non-verbal communication, and the few times that challenges faced by someone without speech would face in a world moving towards voice-command tech were explored, olmost nothing was done with this aspect of the main character. I need to mention here that Alexander Skarsgård does a fantastic job of conveying emotion without words in several key scenes. But, this is a credit to acting, not the film itself. Which brings me to...Final rant is that some really, really great acting is wasted on this mediocre script. All three leads are strong, but Paul Rudd deserves special mention as a thief of scene after scene in his misogynistic, narcissistic, scary portrayal of an AWOL medic working to get a new identity for himself and his daughter. Alexander Skarsgård and Justin Theroux also keep the level of acting high. If only they'd had a script that met them at their level.Why, why, why? Why did Mute make it to final cut in this state? Full of plot holes, almost-great-scenes, wtf moments and some gore that was just Eewwwwww (less gurgling puh-LEEZE!). If you want to see Paul Rudd killin' it despite the script, check this one out. Otherwise, just...no.",Mute
75,sally-w,Give it a go - good sci-fi is hard to find and this is OK,8,7 July 2018,It has a jumbled start and some odd events however I really enjoyed it once it settled in to the story.

76,stretchfoofight,"Slow, drawn out, boring, blah",2,22 March 2020,"Paul Rudd is good In this, that's it. Film about nothing at all, just futuristic film about bad people interacting with one another that takes over two hours to finish.",Mute
77,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A letdown from the guy who made Moon,5,27 February 2018,"As someone who has waited two years for Duncan Jones to release what he called his passion project onto Netflix, this was quite a disappointment. I was hoping Mute would be a return to the same kind of hardcore sci-fi that he made with Moon and Source Code but unfortunately the sci-fi is barely involved in the entire story. And the way that the story is structured has the same kind of problems from Jones's previous big studio film Warcraft.Mute takes place in future Berlin where the film follows a former Amish mute named Leo who is searching for his missing girlfriend Naadirah. Leo is an interesting, complex protagonist that struggles to keep what remains of his Amish identity and is very easy to relate as a character. Alexander Skarsgard as Leo gives a very good and challenging performance since his character lacks the ability to speak. Also the movie focuses (probably too much) on two American surgeons Cactus Bill played by Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux as Duck Teddington. Rudd really shows his range as an actor since his character is not his usual nice-guy-type roles. Cactus is a short-tempered bully who will either swear his mouth off to alienate people or be threatening with brute force to gain some form of respect. His character however is also a protective father who tries to keep his daughter safe in a crime-ridden city despite constantly bringing her on some of his jobs for the mob. But the character that was clearly a problem is Duck. There is nothing wrong with Theroux's performance but his character Duck is what does the most damage to Mute's quality. Unlike Leo or Bill, there is nothing sympathetic or redeeming about Duck but yet he takes up half of the screen-time with Cactus. I would in fact say this is probably one of the worst written characters I have seen on screen that is just uncomfortable to watch.Despite that it takes place in the same universe as Jones's first movie Moon, the film never feels like it is as grounded nor makes as much sense. The look of the futuristic world is definitely beautiful thanks Jones's artistic eye for awe-inspiring visuals but it feels like it's just there to be in the background. Where as last year's Blade Runner 2049 found a way to interwove the use of its futuristic technology into the narrative, the story for Mute only makes use of the future tech till the very end. And it just feels like wasted potential.The movie feels almost tone-deaf with how it approaches the story. Leo's journey through the criminal underbelly of Berlin should feel serious but the use of weird sexual imaginary in the wrong kind of scenes just took me out of the film. Just like Warcraft, the large problem is how the story balances the characters. Despite having a very likeable lead with a unique perspective in Leo, the movie chooses to spend a majority with Cactus and Duck who are terrible as people and just make it feel so miserable, depressing and awkward to watch. The last 40 minutes do become more interesting when you see what the connection Leo has with Cactus and Duck but unfortunately that wasn't enough to save the movie. What strong emotional moments Mute does manage to make is very much outweighed by the bad.It feels like a shame that it didn't meet on the level of Moon or Source Code. It can't even be on the level of just being descent or ok. Here is hoping Duncan Jones can start on something new that is a little bit more focused on how it tells a story.",Mute

It's a quiet film, hence its title. I don't think it's hard to follow or messy. People who say that were not watching the film?....The only one that kind of discredits the movie is he who plays Luba.

So trying to watch this impartially was difficult, but Jones does a decent job overall but nothing to make this anything more than an average film, hence 5/10 from me.

82,jwcstorage,A slog and mess of a movie thats not worth the time,4,23 February 2018,"I'm not sure who is inflating the reviews for this, but this is a far from perfect movie. 
Regardless here are my thoughts on it. 
The movie is a very passable thriller, but its ""sci-fi"" for basically no reason. Literally no part of the plot requires this movie to be in the setting its in, which honestly takes something away for me. If the future Germany depicted was for ANY reason at all, I'd understand... but no, its there just to make you wonder what the reason for the sci-fi stuff is for 2 hours. At the VERY end there is a sequence which MAY have required the future, but not *REALLY*. The movie in and of itself isnt bad, even if its set very weirdly. Its a competent thriller about a man who lost his voice as a child in a boating accident. Oh, did I mention hes Amish or something, also for no real reason? It comes up several times THAT his faith or belief shuns technology, so he doesnt watch TV or use cell phones (until he uses cell phones and drives cars and other technology to search for his gf). So he does the normal movie guy thing; going to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and he only has a few sticks of gum left! Mute, both the main character and the movie itself, kind of wanders almost aimlessly, with an extremely light connection to the actual story. So our 'hero' finds connections and clues and fumbles his way through everything and gets the ""bad guy"" but thats not the end! The movie keeps going for a good while for no real reason. I'm quite baffled at the existence of this flick.By time you reach the END end, you may be scratching your head looking for connections or rhyme or reason... but dont. They're not there to find. SHOULD you watch this movie? I honestly dont know. Like I said, the thriller part was acceptable, but the movie as a whole fumbled along from one point to the next, and ends in a true ""WHY?!"" way. There is no logic in any of the ending events for anyone. The ending itself is even setup multiple times early in the film for more ""WHY?!"" reasons. He keeps practicing a skill that he has no idea if it will be useful, and then the 1 EXTREMELY rare instance where it might be useful occurs. Its like the film maker thought of the ending and then shoe horned in a ""reason"" for it earlier in the movie for no good reason. Its honestly ridiculous! So anyway, the movie has a lot of familiar faces which might surprise you, and Paul Rudd in one of the most out of character characters hes ever played and get this... he pulls it off well! The lead character is a mute so theres not much to say about his performance, he was fine I guess? Same goes for the rest of the cast, the acting was all fine, camera work was all fine, the world felt real, and lived in, a gritty uncaring realistic world that goes on without the cast around, which was nice. I *want* to like this movie and recommend it to anyone, but I just cant. It left me feeling less than if I just did anything, ANYTHING at all, for 2 hours. So.... Watch it or dont, its up to you. I'd say skip this one. I doubt this one will stay with you or have any impact really at all on you.",Mute

The film stars Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood), Paul Rudd (Ant-man) and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive).The one positive thing abut this film is that the actors try, I'm not saying there good but they try and it has a good message about parenthood at the end. on the other hand everything else about this film is shocking. First of all, it is trying to be the new Blade Runner and they completely failed. The effects are awful especially at the beginning when a car is coming into land, truly awful special effects. The editing and direction is all over the place as well, nothing stood out to me when watching this film, you would expect something that is basically copying one of the most visually stunning films of all time would have something eye-catching in it. The every character is dreadful, the villains are annoying and the main character is just an enigma of awful. Sometimes he can fight sometimes he can't, he basically just wanders round everywhere trying to find his girlfriend, which isn't the greatest plot for an over 2 hour film, that's another negative as well IT'S TOO LONG.

I see positive reviews talking about how it's a slow-paced movie and reviews are too harsh: I can partially agree, I don't think it's an absolutely terrible movie, but it is certainly not a good movie and perhaps one of the most disappointing movies I've seen on netflix. But here's the thing: it COULD have been like a noir movie a-la blade runner, but it's not. It's just boring. The story does nothing to draw you in, the main antagonist has the flimsiest motive ever and pretty much nothing pays off. Also someone said it has great side plots, lol wut?Basically, this movie has great settings and good direction but the writing is just awful and the story and resolution just left me feeling like ""um what?"" at the end.

94,catebaum,What happens when nobody says cut,2,25 February 2018,"Unfortunately Netflix producers didn't chip in on the cut, because not only is the script poor and flabby, but so is the editing. This very basic story veers into long pauses, closeup shots for no reason, scenes that needed cutting back by three beats, telling audiences things many times when they already know, loads of characters coming and going, and odd relationships with moral schizophrenia. I basically watched it for Justin Theroux and Paul Rudd, and while the script sucks, they are worth looking at, as is Noel Clarke.
Much to his downfall, Duncan Jones has kept everything in because he's got so many famous actors he can't bear to trim, which spoils the performances. The leading lady isn't compelling enough against these other veterans, so when she goes missing I really hoped she would stay missing and the mute would get on with his life. But he doesn't. A starstruck Netflix team has led to an overly-long telling of a bland script. It's over two hours long, but could be a hour and a half or less. 
But let's do a future dystopia NOT based on Brazil or Bladerunner where all the women are sex-slaves next time, huh? Where were the women? YAWN! Time's up on that!

This is a noirish film set in future Berlin and tells the story of a mute Amish bartender who goes looking for his missing girlfriend. While this story is going on, you have another story going on at the same time about AWOL army surgeon trying to get his daughter and head back home. This movie reminded me somewhat of a mix between Blade Runner and Southland Tales. I have to say right out of the gate that I love Southland Tales. Not many people do. It is considered an outright awful movie that ruined the potential career of Richard Kelly. I do say that it's a very strange movie and I understand why it's not some people's cup of tea. This is important in context when talking about Mute. It does take some time to get into this world and the movie does that really well. I was drawn in by each second and each new revelation. It's also incredibly fascinating to have this character who is so adverse to technology trying to track down someone in a world where technology is so advanced and so prevalent. He has no clue how to use these things and he has to learn as he goes along. Paul Rudd is playing against type in this movie and he works really well. Who knew Ant-Man could be this much of an a-hole? He has his familiar attitude but it is used in a strongly vile fashion. But he's not all bad.

It was fun to see Paul Rudd play so against type. The film looks beautiful, has a great futuristic score & ties in well with another excellent Duncan Jones film. In an age where every Hollywood sci fi blockbuster dwells on brainless action & violence, it baffles me why Duncan Jones has been so ripped apart by the critics for trying to make a thinking man's sci-fi movie which immerses the viewer in a gripping, scary & intelligent world & plot.

100,maryhayden,Good but could have been great,6,25 February 2018,"I liked Mute quite a bit overall. The acting, especially by Paul Rudd as Cactus Bill and Alexander Skarsgard as Leo, was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised by how much nuanced emotion Skarsgard was able to convey without any spoken words or even sounds. Very little pantomime in his performance either. Paul Rudd as a villain was scary and refreshing. Justin Theroux's villain, Duck, came across like a caricature. Could have been the result of the writing, how many times does Duck need to call people babe?The setting in Berlin worked very well for the story. The brick streets as counterpoint to the flying, hovering cars worked well to establish place and time. The flying cars themselves were reminiscent of Fifth Element and many other movies. The high-tech brothel has been covered in different media time and again. These overly done tropes detracted just a bit from Mute. And drone delivery of food ordered on a touchpad kiosk might still be a novelty worldwide but is reality in some locations. Possibly these were holdovers from when Duncan Jones first started the project 16 years ago when they would have been seen as newer concepts. Which leads directly to the problems I had with Mute.The movie was too long for the story told and in the middle felt fragmented. It might be that Jones had too much story to tell and that Netflix gave him free-rein to tell it how he wanted to. The who-done-it and love story portions of Mute were well written and well performed. And by themselves could have been resolved in about 30 minutes less time than the movie length. Too many extraneous side-shows added little. The movie would have benefitted greatly by tightening up direction and some ruthless editing.

It looked cool, but it tried WAY too hard to look like it was trying to be ""Blade Runner"" (without a semblance of a good story).The problem with this movie was that it was so boring. The plot was so by the numbers and muddled that I could barely even sit through this damn movie.Another thing that made me mad was that it failed to even resolve the plot of the movie ""Moon"", which director Duncan Jones said he would do in this film.I watched this a few weeks after watching ""Moon"", and was so disappointed when watching this drag of a movie.",Mute

It is complex, quite slow, not all that easy to follow and its basic plot is nothing world-shattering. But it is also executed very well, visually stunning, has great performances, creates a very unique world and is intriguing throughout.The main story is about a technophobe bartender, mute after a boating accident when he was a kid, who is trying to find his missing girlfriend. The futuristic Berlin, setting of the movie, is very reminiscent of Blade Runner Los Angeles. It is almost permanently night time, populated by highly eccentric people from all corners of the world and everyone appears to be involved in a criminal scheme of one type or another.There are basically no good characters, just varying shades of grey, probably one of the reasons for the bad scores this movie gets. The few nice people here do bad things, the bad people have some redeeming qualities, even the ones that look on the surface like cartoon villains. This is the sort of film that you basically have to watch more than once, it is not easy to keep track of what is happening and much of it may not make sense on first viewing. But it is far, far better than the low IMDB score would suggest.",Mute
104,BuddyBoy60,"A Sci-Fi Noir Mystery Drama that has a Good Story, Some Inspired Acting, and a Great Look",7,25 February 2018,"Duncan Jones's ""Mute"" is also set in the same world with ""Moon"", his first feature film. It is a hybrid of film-noir and science fiction 
elements which forces comparison with the more established franchise, Blade Runner. Both have evident similarities.What is striking in this film-noir is the premise, a mute bartender goes on to locate his missing girlfriend. This would have been exactly like the film-noirs of the 40's and the 50's with a detective as the protagonist except the one in this movie can't speak. How the film shows his struggles with his efforts to find her amidst a city that isn't technologically built for people with his kind of disability adds layers and uniqueness to the story.The acting is also a big reason why the movie works. Alexander Skarsgard plays the main character, the mute bartender, beautifully, you can notice how he sticks within the confines of his non-speaking role throughout the film and still make a relatable performance. Paul Rudd and Justin Thoreaux act as you have never seen them before. Rudd gives an impactful performance as a Rick Blaine-like character who has had it and just wants to get out of the country together with his daughter. He still uses his usual slurs he's known for from his comedies in this film although his part definitely has more drama and grim than the ones he had played before. About Justin Thoreaux, he's just great in the supporting role and is a scene stealer. He plays more humor compared to Rudd. Regarding the photography and set design, the futuristic look of the story's setting is well crafted and is detail conscious. There are some touches that makes this vision unique like the flying food delivery and robotic erotic dancers but unfortunately it may all seem too familiar for the audience and cause the movie to lose some its flare in this department if they had already watched Blade Runner 2049, Ghost in a Shell and others which also feature futuristic, advance technology-heavy set pieces. Nevertheless, credit should be given to the creators of this cinematic world.""Mute"" has not much of a heavy sci-fi story. It is more of a noir mystery drama set in the future. If you like movies such as Brick and Sin City, stories that pays homage to the classic film-noir genre but are set in the present or the future (Neonoirs), this is a must watch.",Mute
105,FilmsFillMyHoles,"It's a deeply flawed film (down to its core), but I really could see myself revisiting Mute in the future.",5,4 March 2018,"Duncan Jones is a filmmaker whose work I'm always most eager to see. In my opinion he really doesn't get the credit he deserves: Moon is a masterpiece, Warcraft against all odds was a pretty decent fantasy film and Mute, while probably his most inconsistent work yet, has sparks of genius. Unfortunately these sparks are kinda few and far between, but they are there. Ok lets get the bad out of the way: Mute's biggest detriment (starting off the avalanche of issues) is the fact that it wasn't Jones' first feature. Initially he wanted Mute to be set in the past, a straightforward noir, that's a perfect premise to start a carreer off (e.g.: Blood Simple), but unfortunately Mute was shelved and after the success of Moon and other sci-fi ""noirs"" (District 9, Dredd, maybe even Blade Runner 2049) Jones decided to set Mute in the future (unnecessarily and kinda annnoyingly ""linking"" it with Moon) and make it a futuristic/tech-noir. This decision in of itself isn't inherently bad, but my bone to pick is that it's obvious that this change was made for marketing purposes: every futuristic aspect of the film feels sorta half-assed and more of an afterthought than fully fleshed out purposeful worldbuilding. Furthermore Mute's plot doesn't even fit its future setting making it at times straight up incoherent. This core problem leads to a chain reaction of further issues: the story itself is servicable if uninspired, but its always at odds with its future setting, the style and tone are totally inconsistent (the vision of 2058(?) feels surprisingly dated, sorta bland and the sci-fi/noir inspirations bleed through without any kind of subtlety (Blade Runner, Drive, Sin City etc.) taking away from the aspects that are truly unique to Mute. 
Lastly some nitpicks: there were a few lines in the screenplay that were quite bad, at times even cringey, I felt completely robbed that we did not see Leo and the ""huge well-dressed brute"" guy duke it out (it was teased so hard it hurt!) and finally the child peformance was just noticeably bad. That out of the way lets focus on the good suff: Duncan Jones' directing has a certain energy and flow to it (very dinamic) keeping your eyes glued to the screen. The three amigos Alexander Skarsgård, Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux were fantastic. As harsh as it sounds they literally saved Mute from obscurity. Skarsgård is a great actor, if directed or utilized well he can be fantastic (e.g.: Big Little Lies). He has a very expressive face and surpisingly wide range so he was kinda perfect for this role. It was also a blast to see Paul Rudd act again (he doesn't just play his usual lovable and funny ""Paul Rudd"" self), he finally plays a character with great intensity. While Rudd is full of energy and chutzpah, Thureaux gives a much subtler, restrained performance, which was also great (also Dominic Monaghan's cameo is a lot of fun as well). These three actors and Duncan Jones' talent (though not fully utilized) elevated this film so much that after the (rough) first 20 minutes I found myself enjoying Mute quite a lot actually.",Mute
106,lambgary444,So close but so far,3,2 March 2019,Once again a movie that had the chance to create a hit was ruined by bad casting. Seyneb Saleh is average looking at best for their lead guy Alexander Skarsgard to be crazy over her it just doesn't fit. There is the fact he is amish and she comes off as a low life there is no way he would go for her. Then you have Paul Rudd playing a tough guy has anyone ever seen a movie before or one with him in it. The bad casting the lazy writing took what could have been a big hit and turned it into another Netflix flop. Netflix is giving everyone money to make movies maybe they should concentrate on the quality a little more. I am all for giving new guys a chance to make a movie but for the money they are spending they are getting crap in return. This is suppose to be set in the future the set's are well designed and the tech they use is some what believable. Then you have them saying Germany is the worse place to be with nothing to tell you why. You need your audience to follow what's going on just as much as understanding the characters. Germany was a poor choice since they gave no reason for what was going on since in 2018 Germany was voted the number one place to live in the world. I digress I still feel there was a hit movie here it just was not produced. directed or casted properly maybe they make a sequel and do it right but if you missed this you did not miss anything at all.,Mute
107,doctordbx,A shaggy dog with no bark,5,25 February 2018,"This movie has some very interesting and even well acted scenes, spliced together to form a story that overall makes no sense and relies on the protagonist having one skill which he works on throughout the story... the ability to hold his breath underwater.We have two doctors, one with an unhealthy attraction to children and another doing his best to flee the scene as he is AWOL from the army. Both act in totally irrational ways to further their agendas. We do know they're lifelong friends, but the allowances they make for each others misgivings are far beyond friendship and the penultimate scene that leads to one of their demises is both telegraphed and extremely predictable.The main protagonist himself, am Amish mute working as a bartender in a strip club in neo Berlin, set in his ways except he totally isn't and is very selective about the code he lives by. He lost his voice 30 years prior and because of his mother's wishes he never tried to get it back. Meanwhile he also works in a den of sin, has sex before marriage, and it completely inconsistent with what technology he wishes to use and doesn't use.To be fair, you could have just dropped the Amish thing altogether and it wouldn't impact the story.Finally you have the woman lead who spends more time on the screen as a picture in a photograph than acting. There's little to know or care about her, except we learn that the young girl who follows Cactus Bill everywhere is their daughter. This daughter is extremely well put together for someone with a psychologically unhinged father, an absent mother and growing up in an environment with death, sex and drugs everywhere.The final scene should have completely sent her to la la land, and yet she takes it with great aplomb. Her father is dead. Her mother is dead. Her father's best friend is dead (after abducting her) and now she is in the company of a stranger whom the only connection she has is he handed her a picture of teddy bears... and yet she places her entire trust in him, right after he drowns her father's friend by utilising that one skill.Some great scenes... but great scenes don't make a great movie on their own and this loose mess of a story beats on for over 2 hours when the only disappointment at the end is not everyone dies.",Mute
108,RaoulGonzo,One of the biggest dissapointments of the year so far!,4,26 February 2018,"This was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year for me, after the excellent moon and the underrated source code - Duncan Jones was one to look out for (never seen Warcraft but will get round to it). Mute from the blade runner dystopic nature and the synopsis of a futuristic Berlin involving talented actors, and director by one as talented as Jones. What could go wrong. Mute unfortunately is a mess, it's a bold mess with one untouched vision. That vision however seems as confused as it is vapid. There are major plot points that are obviously meant to have an impact that just kind of float in an ether of emptiness. A big problem for that disaffectionate tone is the lead Alexender Skaarsgaard who has the physique but not much else - one of the least interesting hero/anti heroes in a long time. Another bad thing would be the score, a melodramatic theme that runs way too often. One of the worst Clint mansell scores to date. I think a bad score for a film like this is unforgivable, also the sound editing was all off - maybe in a cinema it would have been better but in key scenes it just detracts from an already struggling storyline. It basks in trivial plot points while neglecting a bigger picture and potential commentary. After one viewing I feel (like the main character) it doesn't have much to say at all. I did like the set design it really does look smart and the last 20 minutes were ok but it was all a little too late. An indulgence project of disappointment, I keep saying Netflix are doing the right thing by letting creative freedom rule but even the better directors are failing to make their original projects appealing. Next up it's Martin Scorsese's ""the Irishman"" which hopefully bucks a trend.",Mute
109,knyomzp,senseless could've watched this muted d to be in better memory,2,13 April 2018,"So i tried to watch it since i liked the director because of moon alot sourcecode ok even warcraft bcs effects mostly, but this movie i sat through the first hour dying of boredom watching the clock which felt like 20 times knowing there's another full hour+ of this even needed to pause for a while. 
It opens with a cutthroat kid in water doesn't matter why how whatever being brought to hospital a girl and mum wear those puritan clothing.
Next we get our mute that kid who because of that is the mute and later on we learn he didn't get treatment because his mother didn't want it we just have to accept he maybe is a puritan himself and doesn't give a shit about anything but his love the blue haired waitress and he is the barkeeper in the not so distant future they work in a nightclub.
Unluckily the characters feel so uninspired you quickly lose interest in them so it's a love story which doesn't connect to the viewer or doesn't even try to, soon he loses her and looks for her.
So maybe the Future shown here could pick myinterest, hm then the but it shows also kinda bland without too much thinking into it just mostly light tricks to make it feel futristic but the we even see his first smartphone ""the oldest"" she could find for him looking like a nice brick for a mobile thick as 80s mobiles with a widescreen on the back and the keyborad under the screen to.
Also trying to mix a 70ish bowling place a normal coffe , nowadays newspapers, oldschool design tablecloth, ugly sexrobots appealing as c3po, flying cars ,but we mostly see old mercedes cars (nice advertising) which even could be stolen like old ones,D-Mark esque cash with Merckel face, doctors butchering around more careless and less techversed than nowadays ok they are underground maybe anyway ah the weird list could go on it just doesn't feel like a good effort.
The protagonists main weapon a wooden bedpost a few dead persons in the movie 0 gunplay are there even real weapons besides thag huge bowie knife.
Even side characters paul rudds is a unfriendly us undergrounddoc? stuck in germany with a kid (whom he cares so much for he even brings her along in a brothel) whose ""friend"" maybe is a pedophile so yeah have fun with them as supporting crew because these two get some decent screen time because they didn't want the movie to be without much speech maybe.
The dialogues aren't worth mentioning what a load of crap.
Worst of all the scenes of the movie are so unconnected it barely tells a story and creates such a bad flow throwing in so many dumb things together that i felt like a insult to the viewer even the soundtrack was 90% synthi background stuff without ups and downs.
tldr just avoid this boring bland wannabe scifi tries to mix drive and blade runner but has no atmosphere,logic message or characters you may enjoy no action no drama no thrilling thriller doesn't even know what it wants to be.",Mute

Interesting ideas, sloppy execution.",4,24 February 2018,"First off, if you came into this because you were a fan on Moon (2009), i'm sorry to say that this adds nothing to that legacy. Mute is for better and for worse, its own complete thing.Instead, what you'll get is a more grounded take on a Blade Runner-esque future, and a script that flies off the handle without any warning. It starts off simple enough. A mute man's girlfriend goes missing, and he goes looking for her. But then the movie throws in an underground sex trade, the mafia, soldiers going awol, and maybe even pedophilia? The film feels weirdly like a big budget student film too. With the pacing and story lines suffering the most in the first half. But like a car crash you cant quite look away from it. The characters are reprehensible, but interesting. Paul Rudd plays what is probably his darkest character yet, and Justin Theroux performance is....well its worth watching the movie for.Given a few more rewrites, Mute could have been something interesting. But it fires in so many directions that i have no idea what it was trying to say. It is an interesting mess at the very least, filled with good performances.

'Moon' and 'Source Code' are still 2 o my all-time favorites ' The storyline of this movie meanders and never really goes anywhere. The lead character loses track of another character so then he begins his search to find them. By the time we find out the location and status (at the end of the movie) then we don't even care because we've been assaulted with a host of bad writing and unlikable characters. If this movie is the first sci-fi film that someone watches then I could imagine they will probably swear off ever watching another sci-fi show for the rest of their life. It's that bad.,Mute

Not that I take much stock in most reviewers. It seems like someone says one bad thing and everyone jumps on the band wagon. If you do not think Duncan Jones is an auteur then you just don't get film making. The man even made a compelling film out of the W.O.W. franchise! So seeing him run around his own created world again was like a breath of fresh air. I want more films set in this universe!!!! I want shows and whatever else Duncan can throw our way! Now the film itself is like a Sci-fi wet dream. It is a little sleazy in the best ways possible but never going overboard. The mystery is a good one. It really is like a great detective story. I would not even compare it to Blade Runner accept for the aesthetic quality. As apparently we all go full on neon in the future. I loved the main character. His injury causing him not to be able to speak made him a strong character. Go watch it!!!! I won't spoil anything other than to say that Paul Rudd probably gives his best performance I have ever seen him in. Support good Science Fiction so we get more!!!!,Mute
115,Ex3vd,Totally Disappointed,3,24 February 2018,"I've been waiting all 2017 for this movie with a picture of Paul Rudd with mustache expecting for a great movie, and I'm completely disappointed, everything in this movie is bad, the story, the script, the characters, the ambient, and the movie is extremely slow and tedious.The history is weak and repeated, the woman dramatically says ""You don't know who I am"" and we have our movie, I'm tired of this poor resource about the mystery of the poor girl.The script is weak, the characters are poorly written with silly and exaggerated dialogues, many useless scenes lengthen the film that supposed to have 1 hour and 10 minutes, the fact that the character is mute don't complement anything in the history of the film, and his motivations are too exaggerated for such events.The Acting was supposed to save the movie but the characters are so poorly written that it even harms the acting, they sell the movie as the face of Paul Rudd but it's Alexander Skarsgård who is the protagonist here, and he don't do anything new, I've seen this character so many times and he is that hero character who will do everything to rescue the maiden, used in the most linear way possible.
Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux (Leftovers) are great actors, but their characters who are the best in the movie are still very poor, especially the character of Justin Theroux who starts well and gets worse every second without stopping.And neither the visual of the movie saves it, enough of this Blade Runner copying, they don't know how to do different as if the city was forced to be wet every day, there is no future other than the wet one, and guess what, just not even rained in that place. The big city is always night there is no morning in that place, and when they leave the city it's that as if the future had only arrived in one place in particular and in the rest of the world is banned to ride a flying car.",Mute

I'm a huge fan of science fiction and it's that which drew me toward this film but it was totally unnecessary.I don't know what is going on today with sci-fi but it seems that everything looks like it takes place in the same setting as Ghost in the Shell. I thought the same about Altered Carbon although that show was superb and well worth a watch if you haven't seen it.Lastly the harsh reality of the guy with the moustache... Given his downright vile attitude toward everyone and every thing, he would never have lived to the age he is in this movie. Someone or lots of people would have put him out of their misery. 
Strangely though when he found out his BFF or boyfriend or whatever he is, was a paedophile...

The performances are brilliant. Skarsgard is great but he's quite possibly overshadowed by the stellar work on display by Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux as Cactus Bill and Duck. Rudd especially is at his career best here. These characters really are something special and every scene with them is nuanced and captivating.

126,Artifam,Flawed but fair,7,7 March 2018,"Having really enjoyed 'Moon' it's been a long wait for Duncan Jones' latest offering with 'Mute' and perhaps the wait has been a little detrimental to this futuristic saga, as its release has been significantly eclipsed by not only the epic 'Bladerunner 2049' but also the lavish action-packed 'Altered Carbon', which both offer mind-blowing dystopic visions of the future. 'Mute', by comparison, is a much more humble slice of futurama and rather constrained in its ambition. While its futuristic Berlin metropolis is well decorated with neon lights and flying vehicles, it needn't really be a futuristic tale, as it is a simple murder mystery at its heart and certainly makes no social-political allusions to Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', despite having Berlin in common (Jones' use of Berlin is likely more as a tribute to his late father David Bowie, who spent three formative years in the city) and its characters quirky statuses are largely coincidental to the plot. Its central protagonist, Leo, the mute bartender is a shy and unrelatable character to be introduced to and it takes a long time to warm to him and his plight, as his naivety is as frustrating to the viewer as it is endearing to his bar tender girlfriend. Surrounding characters are well written, but often clunkily acted and detach the viewer from the credibility of the tale. However, these initial kinks tend to iron out rewardingly as the plot unravels and Leo peels back the layers of the confounding web of relations that have led to the disappearance of his mysterious girlfriend. By the end of his journey, Leo has definitely won over the viewer and the satisfying ending does largely redeem and help gloss over some of the film's inherent flaws.",Mute

There was a great mix of familiar structures, such as strip clubs, libraries and doctors offices, mixed with futuristic tech, such as the treadmill in Justin Theroux's characters office and and the flying cars.However, the choice of lighting throughout the movie did not aid the borderline unreadable notes that Skarsgard's character writes throughout the movie.

Some people say it's inconsequential to the story, but this is clearly incorrect based on how Leo learns to adapt to this strange world as he finds himself descending into the heart of Future Berlin's seedy underbelly.I think the ""twist"" that screws with the pacing is not as egregious as people make it out to be. It's not a perfect film but one that is well acted, nicely written, visually appealing and quite evocative at times.

One moment they may feel one way towards a character, the next scene, this has completely changed for literally no reason* The references to ""Moon"" in the film are pointless and nothing more than Duncan Jones trying to take some of the glory from that film and distil it into this crap.* Cactus Bill is one of the laziest characters ever written. He is painfully forced to be the bad guy in the film with little to no logic behind the characters decisions.* The pacing is trash; it's all over the place* The sets shamelessly try to be Blade Runner with every opportunity.Avoid.

135,Return_of_the_Porg,Three for four.,6,25 February 2018,"Every time I hear Duncan Jones I am immediately drawn into whatever he is doing. His firs feature film was made on a budget or around 5 million dollars and it surely is an underrated piece of sci-fi greatness. In his short career Jones has made Moon and Source Code two vastly overlooked films that you should definitely see if you haven't already. On his third tango Duncan tackled the challenge of adapting Warcraft to the big screen and he succeeded in making a fun movie that served both the fans of the source material and common moviegoers. But Mute has been on his mind for 15 years since no big name studio ever green-lit its production. Netflix took a gamble on this idea but did it pay off?
Mute is the story of a mute bartender played by Alexander Skarsgård who embarks on a quest to find his girlfriend after she mysteriously disappears. What ensues is a fairly by the numbers noir- thriller set in a Blade Runner-esque world. The plot of the film isn't all that impressive or engaging , which is a bummer, but some fun characters redeem the average material. 
Skarsgård is very good as the silent protagonist but the film in reality is carried by Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux who give amazingly charismatic and insane performances as the primary antagonists of the film. They manage as I said before, to elevate an otherwise by the numbers plot y that has as much originality as a as a Walking Dead episode. It is not overly cliched but it is enough to the point that most twist and turns are fairly predictable, with a few exceptions. 
However I did find this movie entertaining and I did find myself moved at certain times of the film. Some reviewers are saying that this film is the worst that they've seen and I disagree completely with that notion. The second half of the film really elevates what could otherwise have been a colossal flop. My main issue with this film honestly is the script, it has some great ideas but unfortunately it feels like if it was written by a 15 year old. I felt a certain level of disappointment with Duncan yet the ending of the film reassures my belief that he is still an underrated talent. I'll still be waiting for what he does next because movies like Moon and Source Code aren't flukes. In the end I did enjoy certain parts of the film, most notably the third act. The film has some great ideas but unfortunately they aren't executed as well as one could've hoped. The film is relatively entertaining but don't expect to be swept away. 
Final Score: 6/10",Mute
136,jah9000,"Disjointed, Meandering, Not Sci-Fi, But Somehow Interesting",6,26 February 2018,"Why was this set in the future? Why was the main character Amish? I gathered that Cactus Bill was AWOL from the US military. Naad had ratted him out in an attempt to get away from him. That plus the threat of losing the kid was the motive for the murder. But what was the need for that cloak and dagger nonsense? What an over-the-top scheme for someone driven to violence by rage. Seems a mite calculating and prolonged for a man of action known to carry a foot-long blade. The method of murder was also out of character. He's a violently angry guy and a torturer to boot. He's not going to go for a passive method and a death he doesn't even get to witness.The Amish thing... I just don't get it. It's the furthest I've ever seen anyone go to explain a character's circumstances. Why can't this guy talk? Oh, because when he was a boy, he was swimming, and a boat came through and ran him over, and his neck was severely damaged by the propeller.... And since his family was Amish, they refused surgery, so his vocal chords were permanently ruined.WHAT? Leo's Amishness serves as a contrast to the high-tech reality he lives in... but it's a purposeless contrast, which ultimately doesn't matter at all to the narrative or the character. Likewise purposeless is the futuristic setting. It was like watching Bladerunner, only from the point of view of above-average extras. Also strange was the inclusion of a pedophile in the cast... That was disturbingly out of place - up to and including attempts to actually SHOW children in states of undress in a sexual context, which suggests there's more wrong behind the camera than there is in the fictional character's screwed up (if imaginary) mind. It's weird that this pervert survived beyond Cactus Bill. It seemed more likely that Bill would have killed his friend in a rage when he learned that he'd been tweaking Leo, putting his schemes at risk, or when he found confirmation that his friend probably had degenerate plans for his daughter.Not only does he survive, and get access to the little girl... but he then KIDNAPS Leo... why? Oh, so that he can perform an intricate surgery upon him to restore his ability to speak... Why? Oh... so he can force him to say ""I'm sorry I killed your friend."" WHAT?He did that... kidnapped the guy, installed an artificial voicebox in his neck, all as a prelude to taking him to a bridge to throw him over... WHAAAAAAT? It made no sense. In the sequence, it just served to give the viewer a few more minutes of angst over the fact that a pedo had possession of the child. Otherwise, what meaningless detail! ""This is the place that photo you have was taken... look, see the evidence of their relationship..."" We take it as given, man. We don't need to be convinced that the woman was Cactus's wife at this point. ""I took that photo!"" Oooh, what a stunning development. (So to speak.) Who cares, man? You should have been dead long before this. Leo should have discovered the torture chamber... First, the pimp guy, still alive, who he sets free. That guy should just escape the house. Next, the pervert, dead in the freezer. As he recoils from the discovery, he spots the plastic sheeting... He finds the body of Naad, and breaks down. He takes the body out, and as he attempts to leave the basement, is confronted by Cactus on the steps. Cactus loses, Leo rescues daughter, the end. But nah - it's the future and all, so first Amish guy needs to become a cyborg. Perhaps someone will consider this ironic, perhaps a critique of religion, instead of just finding it to be a ridiculous waste of production budget. Even though I say all of that - I kind of liked the way the story was woven. It was somewhat back to front, not a traditional whodunit. The work on future tech was generally pretty solid, and the performances were generally good. I give it a 6/10.",Mute

It would have made much more sense to set the story in the modern day where Leo could be saving his pennies to pay for the operation.Making this a sci-fi story doesn't add anything to the experience. I love sci-fi and this is a great movie but not because it's sci-fi. A gritty modern-day Berlin would have worked better.I gave t his movie 9/10.

146,ekveland,"A challenging, bittersweet personal project",9,24 February 2018,"I saw the second it came out and I came out of it feeling like I liked it, but I needed to digest it more. Here are my digested thoughts:By far and large being squeezed out of a sandwich between BR 2049 and Altered Carbon has done it no favours. It has visual flair, especially for its budget, but with those fresh in our memories and so similar in style it will undoubtedly be compared.It really needed a script doctor (pour another one out for Carrie Fisher). The components for greatness are there, but the tenuous connections between the two plots (of which Hawkeye and Pierce are by far the more interesting) needed to be interwoven much earlier.I know it was first drafted 16 years ago, but when your entire plot hinges on the women in refrigerators trope you are already fighting an uphill battle in 2018Coming fresh off Three Billboards I saw a lot of similarities in how ambiguously the characters were handled. Not as deftly handled, but very much on the same wavelength in treating the audience as adults and showing ""difficult"" characters and complex relationships. Even the pedophilia angle, although that may have tipped the scales for many to deal with in how it was portrayed.Score was fantastic.The world was believable to me, in its mix of old and new.Just enough Moon references to not become unbearableStill unclear on why some side characters were needed. A lot of the fat could have been excised with getting rid of the Lock Stock gangsters and the two timing pimp. The transpansexual ex boyfriend turned friend was needed, but needed a more consistent personality and arc.A mute lead is a fantastic challenge. The amish backstory was a perfect explanation for his condition as well as some good quirky sci fi writing. I'm just not entirely convinced he pulled it off.I'm a big fan of Duncan, and have followed and interacted with him on Twitter for years. He's a genuinely good guy who has gone through a string of personal tragedy. I'm glad he got to make his pet project, but I wonder if it wouldn't have been more fully baked if it had gestated a few more years until his personal turmoil had settled more.It's a movie you should definitely watch, and watch with an open mind.

Though slow at times you aren't going to see a film with fight scenes and cinematography that jumps or bounces all around. But rather a film that takes it's time to build and develop characters and their traits. Mute proves itself to be a noir film that does not mind getting into the nitty gritty of it's characters.
Great visuals that don't make it feel like a Blade Runner rip off. A movie able to set up it's own environment and keep the future and reality relevant.
Alexander Skarsgard's acting alone is reason to watch this film. Paul Rudd does a great job as Cactus Bill a character whom you never know what he might do.
I'm not sure why Metacritic warrants this movie a 35. It seems like there is a great hate in Hollywood for Netflix especially with Spielberg coming out and saying these films don't even deserve to quality for awards.
Netflix is obviously making Hollywood mad.

Not this though, it's a bit of a stinker. I'm not sure what it really was about the film. It should have been right up my alley - sci-fi, dystopian type world, decent soundtrack, great cinematography, half-decent acting - but it just did not come together to make a decent film.It was probably down to the storyline. It was confused and not gripping enough to make you want to stop and try to figure out what was going on. Instead you just somewhat ponder along with the story hoping it will start to make sense. Afterwards I thought I'd spend the time wondering what I had missed, trying to work out when I had left for a piss and missed an important part of the plot; but no, it just didn't make much sense put together as a film. Because it's Netflix and if you're watching I hope it's because you pay these great people a monthly subscription to watch some of their great content, then watch it. For nothing else it's going to pass a few hours.

'll explain.-- Spoilers --Cactus and Naadirah hooked up and had a daughter, Josie. Eventually they got divorced, probably due to Cactus' personality disorder level of dickishness and got joint custody of Josie. For whatever reason Cactus decides to desert the army, steal Josie and go back to the US. To this end he does favors for a criminal to get money and fake papers. He uses this money to pay off corrupt MPs so they don't bring him in. Naadirah, wanting her daughter back, whores herself on the side and asks for money from her friend Luba in order to counteract Cactus' bribes and get the MPs to arrest him. Cactus finds out, from the MPs themselves when they ambush him, kidnaps Naadirah and kills her. Cactus' friend Duck, being a pedophile and a messed up person in general, messes with Cactus' plans by tipping off Leo via phone hoping Cactus will get in trouble so Duck can get his hands on Josie and also get some revenge on Cactus for being such a huge dick. However it all backfires and the rest is self-explanatory if you've seen the movie. In the end Leo loses a girlfriend but gains a daughter for a bitter sweet ending.-- End of Spoilers --No, Mute isn't Bladerunner, it's not an homage to Bladerunner, it's not trying to be like Bladerunner.

168,capitalregioncan,Disappointing follow up to moon,5,6 January 2020,"Mute is about a mute Amish bartender living in Berlin and his quest to find his missing girlfriend. From the beginning Mute is very confusing. We had a hard time following the first scene w Rudd, theroux, and the gangsters, and things never got much clearer. This film constantly left us asking why, but not in a good way. Why is this guy amish? What's the point of that? What's he doing living in the middle of a hyper tech city? What us the relationship of these doctors to the story? What led this guy to this particular place again? Who the heck is sending the texts (and once you find out, why?)? Etc.As a huge fan of the gritty dystopian science fiction genre I expected to love this movie. However, I was very disappointed. Duncan's Jones called this movie a 'spiritual sequel' to Moon. In realiry the two movies couldn't be more different. Moon was extremely minimalist and clever. Mute is over the top and dull. The story is a 3/10. Its confusing and it goes on too long. However, the gritty futuristic underworld is fun to watch if unoriginal, and even though none of us really had any idea of what was going on in the entire movie we were interested enough to want to figure it out.
Rudd and theroux's characters and relationship were really interesting and carried the film. Rudds performance in particular stands out as the most memorable thing about this movie. One has to respect how much skarsgard was able to get from a character without any lines but ultimately the fact that his character was amish and even the fact that he was mute felt like huge non sequitors to me. Minor gripe, but one I feel compelled to make, is that the movie is set in Berlin but it could have taken place anywhere, Berlin is the perfect setting for the futuristic neo-noire Mute was trying to be but they cover the whole thing up un altered carbon, blade runner skins.

It is the best movie I've seen in some time.Although a very different movie from Drive, both have in common that they trust the viewer to pay attention and read between the lines, and are not afraid to take their time to get where they are going.The acting is top notch and the characters are interesting, deep, flawed and often with unexpected agendas and histories. There is good and bad in everyone, and because we follow the stories of multiple characters it makes the story far richer. The world building is minimal but effective, and shows us a near future which feels entirely plausible - neither dystopian, nor utopian. I was always eager to see more of the future Berlin and understand the world in which it existed.The cinematography is masterful in that it puts you right into the story and shows you everything you need to see without excessive flourish.The movie can be fairly violent at times, but it is fairly minimal by modern standards and it does not dwell on these scenes more than necessary to bring the point home.I would be remiss if I fail to mention that Mute does fail to trust the audience in a couple of places where it suddenly switches from the slow progression of subtle reveals to crude and very direct explanations in the form of flashbacks. I'm not sure if the intention was to shock, or if the purpose was to ensure everyone was on the same page, but either way this jarred with the rest of the movie for me and should IMHO have ended up on the cutting floor.

174,The_Movie_King_75,What the....?,3,24 February 2018,"This was a HUGE disappointment. One would expect a somewhat good movie on the grounds of who co wrote and directed this movie, Duncan Jones. 
Duncan Jones first movie, except from a short, was Moon. A great movie that won him a lot of awards, and every person with knowledge of movies would forever remember the name of Duncan Jones because of Moon. His second movie was Source Code, a good and well crafted movie. Warcraft was his third movie. A disappointing box office haul and mixed reviews for Warcraft. The planned sequel is on hold, indefinitely. 
I think all the previous movies has something special in them, and i enjoyed watching them. Moon is a very good movie, and definitely the best Duncan Jones has made. On the other side of the spectrum we find ""Mute"". This is the worst movie from Duncan Jones, by far. The story is a mess, and I just don't get it. It's an attempt on sci fi noir i believe. The only thing bright in this boring and messy movie is Paul Rudd, who steals every scene he is in. It wouldn't have been a Cinema movie, but straight to DVD if it wasn't for Netflix. If you have other options, i would stay away from this movie.",Mute

Sam Bell appears in one extremely brief scene, which appears to be a deleted scene from moon. It's only about 15 seconds long. This is a separate movie in of itself and I hope someday he (the writer/director), decides to write a follow up to Moon. Because myself, along with a lot of other fans, were seriously looking forward to that. We still haven't seen it. The movie is an entirely different storyline, along with entirely different characters. My low mark is the more the result of anger of making people believe this was a follow up to Moon, when it was anything but. I don't believe the writer of this story, had any intentions of following up to Moon. I believe he had this separate story in mind all along, and used the PR from Moon in order to sell it.

I think I'm to the point I will watch just about anything the Alexander Skarsgard is in just to watch him and I'm glad I gave this one a shot.

181,jsalinas-22364,"Great acting, amazing effects, boring as hell",3,3 January 2020,"From director Duncan Jones, the creator of the criminally underrated sci-fi flick Moon, come quite a letdown. This movie had an intriguing premise, talented cast, and admittedly amazing effects, but they weren't enough to save this movie.Leo (Alexander Skarsgard) is an Amish man left mute after a boating accident, unable to restore his voice because of his beliefs against doing so. His girlfriend Naadirah goes missing within futuristic Berlin. On a mission to find her, he eventually crosses paths with two black market doctors, Cactus Bill and Duck (Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux respectively), and everything goes crazy after that. Let me just say: Rudd and Theroux were undoubtedly the funnest things about this movie. They were entertaining, had a compelling bromance that was borderline gay, and they simply had the most entertaining and funny scenes in the movie. Skarsgard is a talented actor and portrays Leo as someone you want to root for, but at the same time, his character is incredibly uninteresting. Since he's mute, there's no way to connect with him emotionally. In fact, literally all the characters that weren't Cactus or Duck were incredibly forgettable and flat. Mix them in with an equally uninteresting and unnecessarily complicated plot and you have yourselves a pretty bad movie.What sucks even more is that the world this movie sets up is actually way more interesting than the people living in it: the effects rival that of Blade Runner 2049 in quality and nobody ever thinks of Berlin when thinking of a good cyberpunk setting. So I was incredibly curious on what the rest of this movie's world was like, especially with the mention of an epidemic of war deserters that Cactus and Duck used to be a part of, but I was left disappointed as I had to ride along with an uninteresting cast going through an uninteresting plot.In conclusion: spot-on performances, fantastic effects, forgettable characters, and overall not worth watching.

Of course I was also a long-time fan of the director's father as well, particularly his ""Berlin period"" and the director does make several references to that in this film, which is also set in a near-future Berlin. The sci-fi element is part of the plot and provides opportunities to bring in some humor as well, along with some action. There are a few violent scenes (definitely not for younger children) but primarily this is more of a cleverly-written drama than an 'action' or 'horror' film, thus we've seen some of the weak reviews from those who are bored if there aren't gunshots or explosions every couple of minutes.

We see the same theme here with Mute, except this time it is Leo.There are multiple layers of characters going around in this movie and the movie doesn't need to paint the entire image for you. Anyone should be able to do it themselves here. Finish painting the image yourself and figure out the characters. You might be disappointed if you structure yourself up to not accept how the characters act (especially near the end) but each character do contain a little surprise.Without spoiling it, and without boasting this movie, it's worth a watch... especially if you enjoyed Mr. Duncan's precious film, Moon, featuring Sam Rockwell.",Mute

The performances of all three of these top notch actors were spot-on for me - especially Mr. Skarsgard (which isn't easy when you aren't required to say ANYTHING)!Throughout, ""Mute"" does contain basic futuristic aspects regarding transportation and communication.

It has countless references to the above movies in so many ways that for those who haven't seen those classic dystopian films, this movie will not make much sense both story-wise and stylistically. The story-line may confuse a lot of people, but the pay-off it delivers is absolutely stunning and transcendent. The silence of the main character (Leo) is a thrilling plot device in and of itself, hence the very name of the movie. I would suggest the people who had a problem with the silence of the main character watch Drive (2011), you'll get your answers there. The run time at over just 2 hours might be daunting for a lot of people, but like Blade Runner 2049 the length of the movie is worth it given the expansive story-line and its various important and dramatic subplots. The movie requires patience, it's not flashy, it's not quick, it's a slow burn that is worth it. I have a feeling that the same folks who dislike the slow-burn have not seen or liked Blade Runner 2049 or Brazil (1985), it's on par with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) which is highly regarded as a masterpiece in and of itself.The soundtrack is beautiful, combined with a cinematography that is absolutely spot on and perfect. Altogether, the story-line, soundtrack and cinematography deliver a powerful movie that draws from highly respected classic films and this is where it would lose most audiences because of its complex callbacks to the aforementioned movies. I agree, it's not for everyone but for those who appreciate the kind of cyber-punk dystopian, slow-burn movies listed above then you will absolutely love and enjoy Mute (2018).",Mute

It had a great plot, although little slow in pace, but quite interesting. Alexander Skarsgård's acting was quite good although he lacks facial expressions while showing different types of emotions. The build up was nice and the climax as well. What spoiled the movie is the unnecessary use of the futuristic Berlin. There are so many neon colors flashing everywhere which distracts people from the actual plot. Moreover it eases out the tension which is required to be kept in a thriller movie. At the end, you will feel there is no role of those gadgets or flying cars in the whole movie except making it dull. It would have been a great movie if the plot was set in current day Berlin (i.e., without all those non-sense distractions) and to do so, the story would not have to be changed even a little bit.",Mute

But I think it depends of what kind of sense you want gain from this film. I get a raw slap in the face sense of emotion and beauty and many angles and directions of human behaviour from it. Do we always need a song to ""make sense"" or can the sense be mainly carried in the emotion and pulse ? Can the same be true for a film ?Personally I think the plot was easily strong enough to hold this film together enough to carry story line journeys into the inner workings of its characters. This to me is how a plot should best be used and produces the greatest stories and films. The actors lived their parts as if they were acting out of things personal to them.

I actually found a ton of connections between the two main story lines (won't spell them out as other reviews seem to do that fairly neatly) that were fun to see come together overall. I actually found tons of plot connections that pieced together cleanly and didn't seem out of place. The acting throughout was spot on, and Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux were especially riveting, both in their weird bond and individual evils. The world Mute created--while riffing on Blade Runner and other futuristic tropes heavily--was still well-done and felt ""lived in.""

For myself though I did enjoy it. The best compliment I can pay it is that I want to watch it again to help me try to validate the dots I joined together.The film is set in the future on the Earth as established in the Director, Duncan Jones, feature Moon. Where an Amish man, rendered mute as a child through an accident and his Mother's beliefs not allowing technology based cure, seeks to find the woman he loves in the underbelly of Berlin after she goes missing.It isn't without its flaws such as why the main character goes back to using an old fashioned telephone book to work out and address when earlier he had seen a method to get it, albeit with some vocal assistance, from somewhere far more convenient (if it had been in the other order this would have been explainable due to his background).So why did I like it? It isn't a standard popcorn Hollywood fare travelling from a to b while telling you what is happening and how to feel. In Mute's case you the viewer have to pay attention, think and fill in some of the gaps yourself. The film is mute as it does not tell you and much like our (anti)hero you have to read or interpret what is being said.You might not realise it until late in the film but there is a parallel story going on around mother's/ parents and the impact they have on the children. While your parents will greatly influence your life you need to break free of the constraints and boundaries that you and they can construct, taking the best of what they give you but being your own person. Moon also had similar themes about finding yourself and setting your own direction despite the life forced on you (at least I think it did I could just be way out on this and misreading).There are other things that I need to ponder as there are hints and tips but no obvious (to me) answers. Such as both this and Moon having the main characters as carpenters of sorts, while also going through life, death and rebirth so do we also have some Christ analogy type stuff on?",Mute

There are several great scenes and enough going on to hold your interest to the end, which was satisfying.Seeing lovable Paul Rudd play a creepy, dark villain was my favorite part of the film.

The future seems to be limited to props and decor without any real impact on the story unraveling on the screen. The action could have been made from an Hindu tailor falling in love with a complicated house girl in the 1920s and the script would have been identical. There is no real connection between the characters, the story and the time frame in which it is executed.That said the movie ends up being saved by well executed screen play, very decent acting and attention to details in the background.

So in the end this feels more like a highly ambitious film student's gradutation project - putting atmosphere and style over substance- than like the work of (accomplished) Duncan Jones. 
If you take it as a film noir, on the other side, you get stuck in thick pathos and the schmaltzy soundtrack which kills atmosphere and mood. 
Which is not to say that one cannot feel the passion of the filmmakers. It apparently took many years to finally get made. Maybe the material lay around too long, to become what it yould have been.
Or maybe, with more time to carve out the characters , it would have played out better in a 3-4 part mini-series.5 stars for the attempt.",Mute

224,minmsn,This is a gem.,9,28 September 2018,"Why this movie, as of writing this, only has a score of 5.4 is beyond my comprehension.
The movie had me hooked from the start.We follow a mute bartender, and his girlfriend that mysteriously goes missing, through the film he tries to find and the same time he discovers parts of her history. 
The movie is not an action movie, but more a detective movie set in a not so distant future. It's not really that important to the movie, but it works great with the story of the movie.
Stellan Skarsgård is great in the role as Leo, his mimic really does not require words.

Yes, this movie does contain some flaws such as it's pacing, and at times, poor dialogue.However, Mute is a visual, and very artistic film. Visually, this film manages to set the tone and setting for what is bound to occur in the duration of the film. A mute Amish man who sticks to old tradition without any technolgy in a cyber-punk film is a very good concept that does not disappoint in this film. Seeing the main protagonist, Leo (Alexander Skarsgård), experimenting with different technology that is ahead of his time just to get past one obstacle in his own investigation.On the other hand, the soundtrack by Clint Mansell, is simply brilliant. It combines elements from a noir film with many ""futuristic"" synths leaves for a captivating score that helps keep the pacing of the film steady and brings life to a character who cannot speak.Mute is definitely not a waste time and yes, it is not the perfect film, but it is very enjoyable and as the audience gets into the mini story arcs of the different characters introduced, it will sure make this film memorable.",Mute

232,gmbeaulac,Incredibly disappointing.,2,10 March 2018,"The plot: A guy who can't talk spends all movie looking for his missing girlfriend. Turns out she's dead. Whoops.Trust me, despite the ""spoilers"" warning, I haven't ""spoiled"" anything, this movie is garbage. Clumsy attempts to articulate the thoughts and fears of the main character through pseudo- flashbacks rob the ""surprising plot twist"" of what incredibly marginal emotional impact it could possibly have long before you reach that point.What's most frustrating about this movie is how much potential it actually has- there are the seeds of a really emotionally compelling story buried in here. Set aside the whole idiotic missing girlfriend plot, and imagine with me the following:An ex soldier and surgeon, and his war buddy, hide out in future germany. He's on the run from the government, fleeing an unjust war and trying to get back home. He works for the mob, patching up their goons and taking care of some of their dirty work. His desire to get back home is complicated by his young daughter, who is mute, as well as his daughter's mother, a german native who is in deep with the mob and has no desire to leave.As the story progresses, we learn the mother's boyfriend is also a mute, and as such he and the daughter develop a bond. We also learn that his war buddy is a pedophile. Torn between genuine love for the man who saved his life countless times, and genuine horror and disgust at recognizing the monster within him, he struggles with what to do, a decision which grows ever more complicated as he considers his own daughter. Things heat up as the military finally tracks him down, leaving him scrambling for the time needed to make final preparations to leave, and bringing him into conflict with the mother and her boyfriend, who don't want his daughter to go with him, the mob, who thinks he double crossed them, and his war buddy, who turns on him to keep his pedophilia a secret. Ultimately his war buddy murders him and kidnaps his daughter, but is himself slain by the boyfriend of the mother, leaving us with a final scene of the boyfriend carrying her off towards her mother and their new life together, in a silence that resonates.This could be a film about the nature of duty, to family, to country, to your own moral principles, and more, explored in a complicated and well developed character played by Paul Rudd, with surprise twist after surprise twist coming at the end, including the death of the main character himself, yet which wraps up so cleanly you're left to wonder if things still didn't somehow end as well as they could, and what the meaning and implication of that might be. You could explore war, the nature of relationships made in it, and what it means if the oaths you swear push you into activities which are fundamentally unacceptable and wrong.This could have been a really interesting, cool, great movie. Unfortunately it wasn't.Instead of that story, we have a plodding, methodical search by the main character for someone who is already dead taking up half of the screen time. We have minor mysteries pop up only to be shot down, and the threads of the film tend to unravel rather than bind together as it progresses. We have some of the best acting in the film done by a throwaway character who literally disappears randomly after engaging in conflict with the ""main character"", and he's not alone- every single character in the film becomes less consistent, more psychotic as the movie progresses, not due to any sort of character development, but rather through an incredibly awkward attempt to bring together this convoluted, garbage plot. By the final 20 minutes or so of the film, nothing anyone is doing makes any sense or has any relationship at all to any of their former actions, and is clearly driven by a need for the movie to end, rather than any kind of motivations from their character.The setting and cinematography was interesting, but this movie is far from action packed. It has as its big 'fight scene' 4 people getting hit in the head by the 'main character' with a bedpost (yep, you heard that right), and a couple of 2 second 'fights' at the end to wrap things up. The main character is Amish for no reason (it seriously adds nothing to the film except for justification for him being mute), and the primary mode of transportation used in the film is a traditional car. The whole dichotomy between 'old and new' is visually interesting, but means the amount of eye candy on display is often minimal and judiciously used, and there are a LOT of blues, browns, and greys used in this film. Which could be fine, of course. It keeps the focus firmly planted on the story, and provides context and depth rather than being itself the primary draw for seeing the film. Unfortunately, the story it keeps the focus on is garbage. You can be a movie focused on the eye candy, or a movie focused on the story, and this one is firmly focused on the story, which is not in any way its strength, and leaves the whole thing as forgettable and mediocre.The audio was fine, not jarring in any way but certainly not in and of itself memorable or enough to carry things. The acting was generally speaking acceptable, with the highlights of Paul Rudd and Robert Seehan. Again the people involved in this film (other than the writers and director) clearly had enough talent to put together something decent. Unfortunately the pacing is horrendous. There are like 6 shots of him holding his breath and drinking a mug of water. Not a single one of those is needed or adds anything at all to the film. The plot is, as described, utter garbage. The character development is non-existent. There is no overall message or lesson attempted to be conveyed. The whole thing adds up to leave you feeling at the end ""what a massive waste of time that was"", and immensely dissatisfied. Hopefully if you wasted a massive amount of time on a pointless review, you'll feel the same way now, and won't need to waste time watching this film to experience that.Incredibly disappointing.",Mute

Some have complained it lacks "" a sense of danger"", and to me that was a strength in that the more routine confrontations have an element of negotiation-like when the protagonist has a warning from his boss- seemed a lot more realistic than the cartoonish ""everything depends on this moment"" melodrama other movies go for with every face off.The plot was good, no fake cosmic ""stakes"" just personal resentment.Just the work put into the kimono scene set was more than everything done with most movies.This movie is like an advances course in set design.I think this was a truly excellent movie, with aspects of greatness, it just wasn't arrogant about its importance.

I would give it a solid 7, but to counter the moronic amount of negative reviews, it gets a +1 bonus. If this is the type of movie for you, go see it, you might be surprisedI really liked Moon, thought Source code was quite good, and loved Warcraft because well, I really like SF and Fantasy films and in addition, I played lots and lots of warcraft/ wow. Since we don't see so much of fantasy today, any decent addition is okay in my book.That being said, movies like Blade Runner 2049 are pure masterclass in my eyes and seeing such films flop badly at the box office opposed to for example Fast and Furious/Transformers or other crap, kinda leaves me scratching my head. So in my perspective, Mute is a nice addition to the cyberpunk noir genre, and even though it gets confusing at some points (maybe deliberately?), I would rather watch it then a perfect drama/history/war or similar type of movie, because ultimately, those kind of movies are ""not my f****** tempo"".That is the whole point actually, to watch the type of movies that you like, and all the so called ""critics"" of the new age that seem to be experts in the movie making business and films in general, make me want to puke. There is no objective reviewing because each of us has preferences. Yes, you can see that some movies are well made, or have great acting or what not, but even that is subjective on some level.So to get to the specifics of the film, I think the point of the film is quite good, .i.e. if you can understand it. The acting is solid, except for Paul Rudd which just shines in this quite weird role.I read somewhere that CGI was used as little as possible, and it is surely felt in the film. Everything looks realistic for this kind of a budget. The music is a bland of old and futuristic with some mashups from bowie and nirvana which oddly works for me.Some films require a working brain and multiple viewings to be fully understood, for example like Cloud Atlas. I would put the Mute in the same bin due to many clues that are there for you to see in its vague story.So to sum up, this gem may or may not become a classic in the future, but if history has though us anything its that the critic opinions actually mean sh**.",Mute
239,XYZealot,Mute hits a bum note,4,24 February 2018,"Feeling like a spiritual successor to the films of the Wachowskis, Mute melds melodrama and soft-sci-fi into a misjudged mess that isn't good enough to be taken seriously, but also isn't endearing enough to be ranked amongst the 'guilt pleasures' pile. The plot runs in parallel following at once the Skarsgard's mute, amish bartender Leo as he attempts to find his partner after her unceremonious disappearance, as well as Paul Rudd's gangster-cum-surgeon-cum-loving father Cactus as he tries to get fake passports to traffic both he and his daughter out of Germany. However, neither of these plots seem to have much of anything to do with each other - save for the characters crossing paths at occasional junctures -until a twist in the third act (with accompanying flashback out of nowhere) that serves no other purpose than to vindicate our hero's actions, while leaving the audience stone cold. Throw into this a paedophilia subplot with Justin Theroux's Duck that is both awkwardly placed into narrative, and just as awkwardly handled, and the entire film falls into failure. While the soundtrack, cinematography and performances may be solid, it doesn't manage to save the film in the slightest.",Mute

There's a reason superhero movies are among top rated - brainless entertainment sells the most. And one actually has to watch this movie to get it and to enjoy it, instead of keeping half an eye on it while browsing through their social media accounts. The plot of Mute is not a total mess and not complicated for anyone with half a brain cell. Yes, it is not a straight forward, cookie cutter, offensively self explanatory. Yes, you have to tie things together, but it all makes sense at the end and comes together nicely. All actors are great and every single one of them has a complex background story, which you, the viewer, have to uncover. The near future and people's behavior is realistic, and no, it is not ""an attempt"" to film noir. Just because majority of scenes are shot after dark, doesn't make it a noir movie - it's part of the plot, since most actions are performed by characters that work in and nightclub. If someone can't even catch this, then there's no hope and they definitely should not give a movie a negative rating.The love story is good and reminded me of Drive. The amount of violence is also on par with Drive - the movie gets very dark towards the end, but any violence is justified and not there just for sake of violence. If fact, I'd say some scenes are even toned down a notch in comparison to most movies these days.I couldn't stop thinking about all the intricacies of the plot even after watching the movie and would definitely see it again.",Mute
243,jam-butty-236-962946,A little longwinded but not as bad as some are suggesting,7,17 March 2018,"I wasn't expecting Mute to be a Sci-Fi, and ultimately it turns out that, though it's set in the future, there's no part of the story particularly reliant upon future technology. Still, the backdrop of neon and drone-delivered fast food is convincing if not particularly original, and is reminiscent of Blade Runner 2049 and Altered Carbon. It's neither done cheaply, nor gratuitously. The majority of the film is set at night, and in various nightlife establishments like bars, clubs, and so on. It could easily have been written to work in 60's London, or modern day Chicago. 
The acting is done fairly well, Paul Rudd stands out in particular delivering a pretty complex character. 
The main failing of the film is the long-winded and slightly meandering storyline, with many scenes being overly long or a complete waste of time (like searching through the phone book, or the conversation with the General); then later, during the film's climax when the protagonist has to get through the biggest henchman, they skip the scene entirely!

248,FordJames24091999,Another misfire from Duncan Jones,5,26 February 2018,"'Mute' is the newest Netflix original release and a film that I have personally been anticipating for a long time, ever since it was first announced way back in 2016. The concept alone had great potential and with director Duncan Jones behind the camera, and the likes of Paul Rudd, Alexander Skarsgård and Justin Theroux in front of it, the film had the capacity to be fantastic. Unfortunately, what was produced ended up being a rather disappointing sci-fi/mystery that focuses too much on its aesthetic and too little on its plotline and characters. Set 40 years from now in the immigrant city of Berlin, the story follows mute bartender Leo (Skarsgård) as he attempts to track down his missing girlfriend whilst crossing paths with a variety of odd characters including American doctors Cactus (Rudd) and Duck (Theroux), who perform surgeries for the mob. Much of the plot line revolves around these three characters and their motivations, which ultimately fails to offer up any real driving force of intriguing story-telling due to revelations that have barely any backstory and a great inconsistency of tone, paired with poor pacing that leads to the film being overlong at around 2 hours. Although the narrative of the film is clouded with many issues, there are some redeeming elements to the film. The most notable of these is the immersive depiction of a futuristic Berlin, which is formed through a mixture of neon-lit grungy visuals and an ambient score by Clint Mansell that serves as a perfect accomplice when creating atmospheric moments. Praise must also be given to many of the performances, with the main standout being that of Paul Rudd. Rudd offers a scene-stealing portrayal of the main antagonist Cactus Bill with many fierce and intense moments, which easily leads him to be the best character within the story. The nature of the character is also a different turn for Rudd and proves him to be a greatly versatile actor that can take on several different roles. Overall, I feel like this is another misfire from Duncan Jones following Warcraft (2016), which is unfortunate as I'm a big fan of both Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011). Perhaps with a tighter script that offers up a more intricate and appealing plot line alongside some further fleshed out characters, Mute could have been another remarkable outing for Jones. Until then however this becomes another average movie to add to Netflix's growing list of original content.",Mute

I enjoyed Source Code, but I gave Warcraft a miss because it's a video game adaptation, and they've never been worth the price of admission.As sublime as it is, it looks like Moon might have been a fluke. I had high hopes for Mute, but it's like Jones took a first-year student film script and somehow got millions of dollars to make it.

252,ncitybookworm,Could have been great...,5,16 May 2018,"This movie definitely had its moments, particularly in terms of Alexander Skarsgård and his character. I might have stopped watching out of pure frustration and boredom if it had not been for how interesting I found Skarsgård's character Leo. His character cannot speak but, that does not hinder his ability to communicate nonverbally. He is Amish and does not drink or use technology, but works as a bartender and lives in a technologically advanced society.The movie itself suffers from an inconsistent and bland plot as well as too much attention to Paul Rudd's Cactus and Justin Theroux's Duck. Rudd does a great job with what he has, balancing being a good father to his daughter Josie and his seedy workplace and connections. If you minimized some of his scenes and cut out some of the unnecessary parts, he would be a great addition to the story.One of the biggest issues I have with the story is the character of Duck. He detracts from the plot and serves as an unnecessary character. If you removed his character entirely, it would have almost no impact on the plot itself however there is a large focus on him. His only purpose is to make the audience uncomfortable in the worst kind of way and to almost make Rudd's character look more sympathetic.There are some great scenes and the cinematography is breath-taking at times. The world isn't ""vaguely futuristic,"" but rather rich and realistic. If the movie did one thing right (other than the casting) it's the world this story creates. It really had a lot of potential, but it lost track of the plot at times, choosing to focus on unnecessary things and characters.",Mute

257,jhuwast,A beautiful hommage to the cyberpunk genre,8,10 May 2018,"I'm very surprised by the low ratings here. As a cyberpunk fan I found it to be really good. The distopian universe they depicted is both a beautiful hommage to what's been done (with some direct visual references) and a welcome expansion to the genre. I'd say that if you like Blade Runner and the Ghost in the shell anime series then you'll likely enjoy this one.
The artisic people behind it did a terrific job creating a believable neon-lit Berlin and depicting the daily life of it's citizens.So with that, do not expect a sci-fy action movie packed with laser guns. The narrative revolves around a mute guy knocking around doors looking for someone dear to him, unraveling the mystery of her disappearance. I personally like this idea of the main character to be mute as it creates more interaction with the surrounding world and it's people, thus sometimes creating funny situations. The other main characters are kind of a wierd bunch with a twisted backstory, the kind of story that's pretty common in the cyberpunk genre. (I mean.. even Blade Runner has it's share of 'em)Now the score by Clint Mansell is definitely way more subtle than what he previously composed for ""Moon"" but I guess the point was to help the believability of the universe, something around those lines. The result is that you don't think about it much, while still enjoying the ride.To sum up this is one of those movies I'll gladly watch again from time to time as it is, to me, a welcome addition to the cyberpunk family.(English is not my mother tongue, sorry about the painful-to-read sentences, but this movie doesn't deserve such low ratings)",Mute

Eraserhead being one that particularly springs to mind. Today's temporary audience want to see something better than they have ever seen before. I like to watch movies thst make me think, this one certainly did that. There were done excellent touches and done thought provoking sub plots such as the reason Cactus was AWOL and test wanted to escape Germany. The whole political backdrop to that was not explained but left the viewer wondering if that was a good or bad thing. The storyline was fragmented but necessarily so in the way that it unfolded with the layers being peeled back to reveal the deep dark secrets in this sub culture of social depravity that was being revealed. Smouldering and intense with some great performances.",Mute

261,tgpil,Paul Rudd channeling Eliot Gould as Hawkeye Piece from M.A.S.H.,1,23 March 2018,What a terrible performance in a awful film. If film goers will notice Paul Rudd wears the same jacket as Hawk Eye Piece in M.A.S.H. He has the same side burns and beard combo. Chews gum while drinking as Elliot Gould did. Wears the same style clothes as Hawk Eye. Regardless. This film is a piece of trash.,Mute

I didn't care so much for Seyneb Salehs character which didn't help, the enjoyment and point of the story. The plot had good potential but I felt the build up was too long as the end was rushed.

267,noahsachs,Awesome in every way,10,25 February 2018,"I loved this film, it's a sci-fi film definitely worth watching. My favorite part is the reference to M*A*S*H (the movie): two military surgeons Paul Rudd as Cactus Bill and Justin Theroux as Duck doing a great knowing update to Trapper and Hawkeye from M*A*S*H, the martini, Hawaiian shirts, the surgery room banter, and Duck calling Cactus Bill ""babe"" (from Kelly's Heroes?) made me smile every time. Also, set in a Blade Runner future with a fresh German twist, not something I've seen before. Great special effects, fantastic setting, beautiful acting. Highly recommended!",Mute
268,Culturesync,Perfect,10,25 February 2018,"Amazing timeless Berlin 'Szene Vibe'; (lived there) a future cultureclash of an Amish in Germany and a nod to the past allied/ American occupation.

(Uff, long sentence ;)) 
The beauty and existential terror of apparent cosmic randomness in peoples lives: tragedy, comedy and in this story, both, inspite and because of Leos blind, not mute! determination -ultimate redemption.
Also, this film feels curiously very much rooted right in this moment and place of each of our own lives. Brilliant performances of Skarsgaard and Rudd, Duck was equally so real, it scared the s*** out of me for Cactus and his daughter.",Mute

Abrams about screenwriting and wow, did this film have a ""mystery box"" until the final minutes.

270,lojohn-77131,"Great Story, not half bad",8,26 February 2018,"When I saw the initial reviews, I immediately prepared for disappointment.
Turns out, the movie was great. Easily 7 to 7.5 and maybe a narrow 8/10 for me. It is technically above average, 3/10 is plain ridiculous.I have to say this film is more drama than thriller.
And yes, it can use a bit of refinement on pacing, and does lack a bit of punch.
However, it did tug on my heartstrings on certain spots, and showcased a range of complex relationships and emotions between the characters.
It's great fun because in the end, its hard to tell who the villain is.
I say this as a person who appreciates Drama and slow tempo Art films.This film is not meant to be:
1) a blockbuster thriller
2) a hard Sci Fi that pushes philosophical questionsRather, it is more of a drama / tragedy that effectively uses the Sci Fi backdrop to highlight the contrasting character of the protagonist Leo. Who is a sensitive soul and a man pure at heart who is unaffected by all the neon signs and the madness that surrounds him.",Mute
271,johnwible,"Is it still a ""spoiler"" if it's a horrible movie to begin with?",2,28 February 2018,"To say this contains spoilers is to imply there's something worthy of spoiling.Simply put, this movie never should have been made. Skarsgård performance is the only reason I give this any stars at all. He shows up and attempts to turn in a heartfelt believable performance for a horrible script set in an unnecessarily absurd place. The rest of the cast phone in performances for which they never should have been cast.The setting is unnecessary (set in ""sometime in the future"" in Berlin). The set design is Blade Runner, except brighter and more cheesy. It also has no bearing over the story at all. And in fact raises questions that are never answered i.e. the two antagonists served together in the American military ""in Fallujah"" implying it's the somewhat near future, or the US went to war again in the future. They never explain when it's supposed to be, or why, or why there's American troops in Germany or anything. They just have this bright distracting backdrop that serves no purpose and has not bearing over the plot at all. Had it been set in modern America (or Germany) it would have been actually fine. An Amish mute would be a fish out of water in either. But they set it in the future, why? Because I guess Blade Runner was coming out this year. That and I'm thinking Paul Rudd wanted to dress like a pimp.Then there's the plot. The only character who's actions/motivations make any sense at all is the main character, who has a singular purpose - to find his girlfriend who vanished. The rest of the characters are poorly written and poorly executed. In lieu of ""depth"" they give each of the antagonists not one, but two personality traits. Paul Rudd's character cares enough about his daughter to monitor her sugar intake, and he's a sociopathic surgeon for the mob who kills his daughter's mother ""because you want to take her away from me"" (which they never explain how or why). His partner in crime (played by Daniel Fathers) runs a clinic where he fits children with prosthetic limbs, oh and he's a pedophile who films them. And when the main character kills Rudd's character he proceeds to knock him out and fit him with a voice box before attempting to kill him. Why? Exactly.This movie doesn't make any sense. I've never written a movie review before, this was just one of the worst I've seen in a long long time. And I needed to let the rage at having wasted my time out.",Mute
272,zaferlayik,Tremendously awkward,3,2 March 2018,"1- What is the significance of being in the future with a mute? What do you want to say to the future with lights on a mute (and amish too)? That's a violation of basic rule: show something and make use of it. Gorki rule. You take things, notions, arguments, objects in your quadrage and you use them for your say. That's the meaning of being a director. 2- You gotta have inner-consistency. No things are absurd on the screen as long as these are consistent. For example, if you use a carved art-piece as a weapon and if that weapon is enough to destroy huge men with one shot, then it should destroy any normal human as well.3- Future is where security is excess and freedom is less. Yet, publicly committed crimes and no chases? Even today I would see cops behind a reckless driver hitting on others on a main artery. The future has less technology to catch a stolen car and chase it?4- Among many others, this is the most ridiculous one: as a bartender, if you fell in love with a hot, half-naked strip bar waitress and part time-hooker, chances are you will have to beat many drunk-felles up harassing your girl, more than one. Come on.5- What the heck with the US soldiers in Germany? Again, you give one thing in your plot, use it properly.6- I knew from the beginning that mute was about to drown someone in the water. But that ending? Also, how do you get away with that publicly murder?",Mute

Casting a wonderfully charming Paul Rudd as a heel character was a poor choice, whereas the protagonist Leo (Skarsgaard) is definitely uncharismatic and lacking the strength or passion to compensate for his lack of charisma.The worldbuilding (this is inexplicably a sci-fi film, even though it never had to be) has a vague consistency, although generally not well explained. Multiple viewings may reveal back plot points but generally I felt confused and frustrated watching this movie.Generally I feel as though this film could have been excellent but it lacked some exposition and a lot of charisma.",Mute

278,freereapergaminguk,Did you lot even watch the movie? - Critcs no clue as many other reviewers here!,10,13 March 2018,"Mute is an excellent movie for the most part, aided by some of the best performances in a movie to date. The story is set is a dystopian future in a blade runner sci-fi setting, which in turn makes a unique setting for the story of the main character Leo who is played wonderfully by Alexander Skarsgård.The cast does a stellar job with the script and the setting that they are in, some fantasic performances by Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux with great support from Seyneb Saleh as Leo's Girlfriend Naadirah. There is a great British cast as well which many will recognize from popular uk tv shows no doubt. But for me the performance of Alexander Skarsgård is Oscar worthy, he is phenomenal in this movie and to be fair is the first major role that he has been in that he really shines in except for his performance in the TV series True blood where he is fantastic also. The film follows the adventures of Paul Rudds Character Cactus bill who is an American who is stuck in Germany following us army deserters after the war who is in hiding from the USA and his ex - wife. His buddy duck is also is partner in crime as they both end up working for criminal underground mastermind Maksim, who promised to do Cactus papers for him and his daughter to get out of germany if he works for him and does his bidding when he asks.The film follows the story of Leo to start of with up till Naadirah just straight up vanishes following a night of love an passion to which she says to Leo there is something you don't know about me to which we have no clue until later on in the movie. Once she disappears it follows Leo's relentless search for the woman he loves. But because he cant talk and his beliefs in using technology (which he reluctantly gives in too to help find her) he struggles to do so, which makes you feel for him even more in my opinion. Things take a turn for the worse for Leo as through his efforts to find his missing love he causes all sorts of problems for Maksim and his underlings and eventually Cactus as well as it all comes together rather nicely in the ending of the movie.The interesting settings the sets and the effects make for a telling atmosphere in this movie and it does not shy away from dubious topics in the movie from sex slavery to female objectification to cross dressing prostitutes to even naked robot females pole dancing, as well as torture, murder and pedophilia. Its a no holds barred brawlfest with various objectives for each main character which is portrayed through the story and goes back and forth between Leo and Cactus for the most part of the movie. This missing person's movie takes a massive twist at the end of the movie, and if you do not want to be spoiled then stop reading and go watch this awesome movie yourself. I will say i can see why people get lost in the story and why they think it feels disjointed but its not, it makes sense and i feel it has appropriate character development throughout given its 2hour running time. *SPOILERS AHEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!*It turns out that Cactus is Naadiah's ex gilfriend who he knocked up when they were younger, and both he and Naadiah had been fighting for the custody of the girl, and Naadiah had tried to take her daughter away from him because of his violent temper and it turns out he is a bit of a nasty individual at the end of the movie even though you are rooting for him when he is beating up duck (his best mate) because he discovers he is a pedophile. A pretty obvious reveal when you notice how he talks about the young girls throughout the movie. Anyway Cactus kidknapps Naadiah from Leo's bed on the night that she disappeared and murders her for trying to take his daughter away from him as he found out she was getting money to pay for herself and her daughter to escape germany and start life a new without Cactus. Leo eventually finds his way to Cactus as he discovers about her daughter and how she tried to hide her from Cactus from her mum. He finds his way to cactus home where he makes the gruesome discovery (through ducks help as he wants him gone as he wants to carry on being a creep) of Naadiah dead from suffocation. That scene will sit with me for quite some time, as it is easily one of the best pieces of cinema portrayals of emotion without words in any film. Alexander should be proud of his performance here, it was an emotional scene and had me in tears as i really felt for Leo after all he had been through to find her only to find her dead at the hands of cactus.Leo confronts Cactus and kills him, only for Duck to come home and knock Leo out and chop up his dead girlfriend. Also he is after Naadiah and Cactus daughter for his own pervy needs and decides he is going to kidnapp the girl and leave germany. Not before he operates on Leo and implants a computer voicebox into Leo's throat so they can have a ""talk"". So he takes the broken Leo prisoner and the daughter in the car, at which point Leo has already met the daughter and gave her a picture of a big bear looking after her, to which she shows him, and she has drawn on a picture of her mother. This gives Leo the motivation to save the daughter from Duck who repeatedly shouts abuse at Leo for killing cactus and trys to make him feel even more guilty before taking him to a bridge and trying to throw him off. To which Leo bear hugs Duck and Jumps in the river and holds him their until he dies while Leo is a master at holding his breath (as hinted at various points in the movie). This is before Josie (the daughter ) is about to fall into the river as well, when Leo speaks for the first time shouting at her to take her back as its dangerous and even this has much emotion as Leo is terrified she is gonna fall in and all that is left of Naadiah would be gone forever. Leo then gets back up to the bridge to take Josie to her grandmothers now being able to live a normal life thanks to duck giving him his voice back.personally i hope there is a sequel as i would like to see how Leo changes his lifestyle and how he protects Josie as there is going to be retribution from the Russians from what he did to them all ( at least id like to think there would be).This movie is one of the best Netflix movies and i don't understand how people have rated it so low, normal reviewers and critics a like. I guess we watched 2 different movies? or they did not watch it at all?.10/10 for me.Hope Alexander gets some recognition for his performance as if it was not for him this movie would not be as good as it is. Will be uploading a movie review on my channel as well so feel free to pop by and check it out.Peace.",Mute
279,apblose,Underrated and unique concept,7,14 March 2018,"I really enjoyed the concept of the film. The fact that the main character couldn't speak and that he didn't even want to made him seem gentle at times yet badass at other times. It also made me wonder if this character could speak, what would he say? But it's obvious his mute persona shaped him into the man he is in the movie. I understand this film was not perfect, the storyline went on some unnecessary tangents but overall I think it told an amazing story and really stayed true to humanity. For instance, Paul Rudd's character was not completely good or evil. I think that is good way to show that morals are not always black and white. The characters were so complex it really made you think deep into their motives and stories. Now, the visuals in this film were absolutely splendid. The colors, lighting, and costume design was prime. I can see clearly influences from other films for this but each piece of great art is always influenced by others. I believe this movie is very underrated especially for a Netflix movie which are usually hit or miss. I think this movie hit and it deserves a higher rating than a 5.4 I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sit down and watch a somewhat psychological action thriller, if you pay attention it is sure to entertain",Mute
280,hanifrehemtulla,Compelling and stunning screenplay strategically woven together from start to end,10,12 July 2018,"This is my first review on imdb. The cinematography in this piece is on point. The characters and roles unexpected, which though some people have criticised in their reviews, in my opinion was a true plus.The performances were convincingly over the top, and really made this film shine.Though the budget for this film may not have been ""blade runner size,"" the actings truly compensated, and more.Several people have written in their reviews that it doesn't make sense, the story line doesn't go anywhere, etc. Simply untrue.If the speed or pace don't seem to make sense, you just need to pay closer attention. I switched on the subtitles to that I wouldn't have to go back and forth too much.If it was in a theatre, I might have lost myself at a few points and not been able to piece it all together in the end. However, watching this from Netflix and being able to pause, reflect, and continue, there was nothing left unexplained, unless intentionally.There were tiny little teasers tastefully sprinkled through this film. There were cringeworthy moments, so sweetly short that before you could turn away from the screen, would be over.I had to write this review because if you were not to watch this film, you truly would be missing out on something.Films like these are hard to come by, and pick out through all the garbage that floats at the surface of Netflix.Nice work by them, and I hope they continue developing unlikely storylines and scenarios such as this one.",Mute
