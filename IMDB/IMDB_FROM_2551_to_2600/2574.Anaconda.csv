0,TheLittleSongbird,Poppycock is the best way to describe this movie,3,18 January 2011,"That said, Anaconda is not bad enough to be one of the worst movies ever made. The tropical scenery is splendid, the snakes are impressive and the premise while daft was at least interesting. However, if I were to coin the phrase ""absolute poppycock"" I would give it to Anaconda. The story was interesting in its concept but it is very predictable with some unbearably silly scenes. Anaconda is also quite poorly paced, sometimes it drags, sometimes it feels rushed. The script is very cheesy and clumsy, and the characters are shallow. The direction is rather murky, and the acting is pretty dire. Jennifer Lopez is very bland in her role here, while Jon Voight is annoying and just awful with a very poorly written character, complete with a horrendous accent(not quite Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 horrendous, but still it was dreadful). So overall, it is not good. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Anaconda
1,Leofwine_draca,'50s style monster flick with tongue in cheek and an exciting plot,7,17 March 2015,"This underrated monster movie came out around the same time as THE RELIC and both films got poor reviews. I happened to see this at the cinema back in '97 and I remember being distinctly underwhelmed by the film. After catching it on television again last night, my opinion has radically changed. While it may be a cheesy film with bad acting and poor special effects, the makers of this film obviously have an affection for B movies and, as one reviewer on the IMDb noted, there is definitely an old-fashioned feel to it, it's a bit like a '50s giant monster movie updated to the present day. On retrospect, I enjoyed this far more than the disappointing and hugely generic film that was THE RELIC, and after watching many of the recent so-called ""horror"" films on release, I've come to appreciate this for what it is : a fun, shallow and fast-paced little film that delivers the goods on the gore front.While it's not a particularly bloody film, many of the deaths by snake are gooey and gruesome in the extreme. We watch the victims as they get slowly crushed and their bones break out, and then watch as their blubbery bodies are digested by the snake. In the film's big moment, Jon Voight is eaten, only to be regurgitated as a half-eaten mess moments later. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, his corpse winks! The plot is a typically contrived and generic one, but as I mentioned it's fast paced so you don't have time to dwell on the holes. The acting is pretty bad, but again that's typical for a film of this variety - what's not typical is that most of the actors here are famous, or have become famous since. Jennifer Lopez takes the lead and frankly I can't see what all the fuss is about, to me she's unattractive and a bad actress to boot. Joining her are Eric Stoltz in a nothing role, and he spends most of the film in a coma after eating a deadly wasp (strangely, though, he doesn't die!). Ice Cube is the likable, gruff and unlikely hero, a feat he pulled off again in '99s THREE KINGS. Jonathan Hyde plays an Englishman in a role that borders on the offensively stereotypical - if we British aren't depicted as bad guys, then must we all have stupid accents and be figures of ridicule with our silly ""stiff upper lip"" type characters? Bad acting awards go to Jon Voight for his supremely hammy portrayal of the film's villain, a lip-curling, eye-winking performance which I found to be hilarious - he's great, having a laugh, and miles away from the boringly serious characters he played in films like Deliverance. A pre-stardom Owen Wilson is pretty bland, and Kari Wuhrer is all glamour and no intelligence. Eagle-eyed viewers may spot FROM DUSK TILL DAWN's vampire bartender Danny Trejo as a snake victim whose suicide kicks the film off.Now, for the special effects, which are a mixture of CGI and animatronics. The animatronics are great, and very lifelike. The CGI is not so, but at least it looks pretty as we watch the snake swirl through the air and stuff. I've seen a lot worse in more recent films, and at least you can see the effort that's gone into this creation to try and make it look as spectacular as possible. Speaking of spectacular, there is the requisite explosive finale which manages to be quite exciting as things go. ANACONDA is, to me, a welcome monster movie from a time when most horror films were slashers squarely aimed at a teenage audience. Thankfully, this film has no teenagers and no masked killers. That, the fun monster and the change of location (an authentic-looking Amazon jungle) make this one to watch again and again for me.",Anaconda
2,SnoopyStyle,Enjoy the big horror fun,6,3 October 2013,"A group is going up the Amazon to film a lost tribe. On the way they rescue (Jon Voight) stranded on a damaged boat. Then the leader of the expedition Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz) is struck down, and the stranger starts to lead the expedition astray.This is not an award winning film. But it does what it intends to do. It is a fun horror. On the plus side, they have great actors on the boat. The cast include Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde, Owen Wilson, and Kari Wuhrer. Jon Voight knows what this movie is, and throws any acting books out the window. His over the top creepiness fits his character and this movie style.Most have complain about the CG. The snake does look cheap. I'm willing to overlook the CG problems. The live action ones aren't that much better. It's not that big of a deal. Enjoy this for what it is.",Anaconda
3,Horst_In_Translation,Not as bad as they say it is,6,5 January 2015,"""Anaconda"" is a 1997 movie directed by Luis Llosa. Almost 20 years ago, it somehow killed his career as a director as he had been very prolific before that, but only directed one film afterward. He worked mostly as a producer since then. The writer team is the same from the famous film ""Top Gun"" and they also did a sequel to this one here. ""Anaconda"" scored quite a few Razzie nominations (the Razzies got it wrong again, as they usually do), but I have to say I was occasionally entertained watching this and I would not even call it a guilty pleasure.It starts a bit randomly with Danny Trejo (""Machete"") in the first scene committing suicide after the snake attacks him. Who he is or why he is shown we never find out. I am not sure if they just wanted him in there because he was famous (if he was?) or what was the whole purpose of that intro. Other than that, the film has a couple more well-known actors including Academy Award winner Jon Voight, Academy Award nominee Owen Wilson, Golden Globe nominees Eric Stoltz and (incredibly hot) Jennifer Lopez, rapper Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde and Kari Wuhrer, who has been in quite a few (animal) horror films. The standout is Voight though, sporting a ponytail in this film and portraying a character at least as scary as the snake monster he is after. He saves one guy's life early in the film, but takes another later on. A true monster he plays here. So it was basically a fight of human beast vs. animal beast. And would you have guessed that swallowing a dangerous tropical bee can save your life from the Anaconda. It did for one character as he was in the cabin pretty much for the rest of the film afterward.Basically, the film is all about people being in the water and the dangerous situation with the audience wondering if the giant snake will appear or not. I thought this invisible danger was actually bigger than the real danger when the beast occurred. But that's usually the case for me that invisible danger works better to scare me. That is also why ""The Blair Witch Project"" had such an impact on me. One thing that surprised me is how Wilson's character becomes the aide to Voight so quickly in the film. Far too quickly for my taste. Anyway, maybe he saw a strong leader or father figure in him I guess and he was just easy to manipulate. Oh yeah and then there is also the bee scene I mentioned earlier. Man that was scary and gross when they get the insect out of the guy's mouth, probably tougher on me than the most snake scenes.What I liked was how they managed to show how everybody felt out of place in the jungle except Voight's character who was all home and natural in there. I am not sure if I liked the scene in which the team tries to trick Voight's character (and succeeds), but the ""A*shole in 1""-comment was kinda cool. What I did wonder, was how Voight's character (after he seemed to be dead early) managed to get out of the water with the tranquilizer in his blood. That was not particularly realistic. And I was a bit surprised about how the snake always showed up where the team was.I liked about the film that, at 90 minutes including ending credits, it was not longer than it should have been and they kept it pretty much very essential. It was also not too difficult to create a connection with all the characters and quickly understand who is who, which is usually one of the most important things about a film. But that also could have been because I was quite familiar with most of the cast. However, I wished that maybe they would have gone for a slightly different ending in which the animal prevails and just kills everybody. Could have made for a nice change. Anyway, decent animal horror film. Recommended.",Anaconda
4,mark.waltz,"No matter how many times you regurgitate this, it's still hard to swallow.",3,13 July 2021,"Probably the funniest of the guilty pleasures and bad films most people love, this is admittedly still one of the biggest stinkers of the horror genre, mainly thanks to the silliness and some genuinely wretched acting, particularly by a certain Oscar winner way beyond his sell by date. For Jon Voight, this is his ""Valley of the Dolls"" and ""Mommie Dearest"", and unlike Patty Duke and Faye Dunaway, it's obvious that he's enjoying the hideous performance he relishes giving.If the idea of Charlton Heston playing a Mexican or John Wayne being Mongol gives you a chuckle, just wait until you hear his hideous Spanish accent, a modern day Frito bandito stereotype where you can't believe what you're hearing. Joined by Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, Eric Stoltz and Owen Wilson, he's the tour guide for a group of National Geographic filmmakers on the search for a reclusive Amazon native tribe, but they encounter something much more mysterious and far more deadly than even the most ruthless of man eating natives.It's wild bore for a week's worth of dinners, only fattening up the victims of those who will fall prey to the ugly giant snake, non poisonous but that's not necessarily an easier way to die. This creature (greatly exaggerated for the movie) has a unique way of dealing with its prey, and intended victims, as evidenced at the beginning, would rather commit a quick suicide than the suffering and gross entrance into a tomb of death that sees them quickly pushed out quickly enough for a wink before the final descent.There are poisonous wasps the size of roaches and other poisonous vipers, brought aboard the ship through an intentional explosion, and at least there's some pretty scenery among the disturbing elements of the film. Performances are a mixed bag with Jennifer Lopez barely able to get a realistic reading of any of her lines and Owen Wilson more out of an overaged surfer dude than a National Geographic reporter. It's fun to laugh at, and each time you watch it, you'll find more chuckles among the film's many absurdities.",Anaconda
5,kosmasp,You can't be serious,8,26 July 2020,"And let's be clear: the movie isn't serious! Take the performance of Jon Voight, who some have compared to different characters portrayed by different other actors, one of them being a Robert De Niro role. One thing everyone agrees on though is that he plays it over the top - as over the top as is possible and maybe even further out there. It fits the whole sentiment of the movie.Then you have some actors that were not as known back then but at least ring a bell now. Now you could blame this movie to have spawned and birthed a lot of bad imitators (even some sequels that are seen as gross and just plain bad by some). But this put a lot of effort in what it did. Not that it all translates well on screen. The CGI effects look weak to say the least, but not worse than the ones used in part 3&4 which were made over a decade later! The model effects (it is not just CGI as some reviewers would like you to believe here) are quite decent, but as the making of reveals, could have worked better if different animatronics would have been used.Having said all that, the movie deserves to be just seen as entertainment. Try to enjoy it for what it is. Call it guilty pleasure if it helps - just roll, ride - heck swim with it! It's a freaking Anaconda eating people for crying out loud - what do you expect? It's as good as it gets",Anaconda
6,gavin6942,"Now I Know What ""Truly Awful"" Can Mean",2,7 March 2006,"A group of young filmmakers enters the Amazon to film a tribe for an educational film (like National Geographic would). This becomes impossible, but their luck is looking up when they meet a local snake hunter (Jon Voight) and decide filming him might be even more interesting. But the anaconda (at least in this movie) is a creature more ferocious than even Voight can handle...Today I found evidence that Roger Ebert smokes crack cocaine. While usually his opinions are on the mark and I can see where he's coming from even when I differ with him, this time he was hitting the crack pipe. Three and a half stars? And a praising review? For ""Anaconda""? I'm sorry, but you can't pay me enough to find something nice to say about this film. I might say it's so awful it's almost good, but that's not even true. It really is just plain bad.The plot is weak, the pacing is horrible. No music to speak of. Decent scenery. Amateur director (Luis Llosa), and it shows. A cast which boggles my mind. Someone thought a good cast would include Ice Cube (""Ghosts of Mars"") and Jennifer Lopez (""Gigli""), not to mention Eric Stoltz (""Mask""). Owen Wilson would be great comic relief, but he's playing a serious role. Jon Voight has an Oscar on the back of his toilet, why is he in this movie? And is Angelina Jolie going to be as ugly as him in ten years? The other great actor, Danny Trejo, has such a small part I guarantee you won't notice him. Most of these actors can be good in their own films, but together they're a hodge-podge of wasted talent.If the movie is bad, we can rely on the horror movie villain, right? Not this time. The ""magic snake"" swims and flies, is an obvious cartoon, and does things to his prey that are either funny or just stupid -- not scary. In one scene, where he appears more like a robot instead of a cartoon, he attacks a robot-like cat that looks like he's an automaton that escaped from Chuck E. Cheese.In the ultimate irony, Jennifer Lopez's character says, ""This film was supposed to be my big break. Now it's just a big disaster."" That really summed up my thoughts on her role. Another character said, ""The last time I was in water like this I was up all night pulling leeches off my scrotum."" Trust me, he enjoyed the leeches more than I enjoyed watching him in this.If you want to watch a movie about anthropology students getting attacked in the rain forest, rent ""Make Them Die Slowly""... plenty of cannibal action and real terror. Don't let your friends trick you into watching horse apples like this film. The only cure for this is intoxication. Not recommended! Do not see! You have been warned!",Anaconda
7,lee_eisenberg,snakes off of a plane,5,18 June 2006,"OK, so in retrospect, ""Anaconda"" looks pretty ridiculous: Ice Cube talks like a rapper wannabe, Jennifer Lopez always looks like she's getting made up (despite the fact that they're out in the jungle), and the title serpent only attacks obnoxious people. If we accept the movie as just a cheap action flick, it doesn't seem all that bad. The main question is how Oscar winner Jon Voight ended up in something so silly (and the major goof of having Brazilians speak Spanish).Oh well, Owen Wilson had to start somewhere; he should thank his lucky stars that he didn't have to start out in ""Dante's Peak"". Also starring Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, Danny Trejo, and the voice of Frank Welker.As for snakes in movies, we'll have to see how ""Snakes on a Plane"" turns out.",Anaconda
8,jboothmillard,Anaconda,5,25 October 2011,"I have seen this vicious creature film plenty of times to remember many moments from it, it is one of those films that is easy and simple enough to not enjoy, even though you know it's a tiny bit cheesy, from Razzie nominated director Luis Llosa (The Specialist). Basically a survey crew from National Geographic are heading into the jungle of the Amazon with filmmaking equipment to search for a long lost native tribe. The team are headed by anthropologist Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz) and director Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez), and fellow crew members are cameraman Danny Rich (Ice Cube), visionary Warren Westridge (Jumanji's Jonathan Hyde), sound engineer Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson), production manager Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer), and the tug boat's Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). While travelling down the Amazon river they come across a sunken boat and rescue stranded Paul Serone (Razzie nominated Jon Voight), and he offers to help them find the tribe they are looking for, but his true intentions are completely different. After Cale gets stung by a wasp in the throat Serone takes over command, and after suspicions he slowly shows his true colours as a brutal man trying to achieve his objective. He is in the jungle tracking and trying to catch a record breaking huge Green Anaconda snake, and they all realise they are all in danger when it shows up, and will kill anyone with its mighty strangulation and swallow you whole with its big dislocated jaws. Mateo is killed first, and after saying he will help Serone help capture the snake for the profit Gary is next to die, and after trying to hold the human villain back, he manages to escape and chokes Denise dumping her body to drown. After killing Westbridge and Cale awakes from his unconscious state, the surviving members Terri and Danny seemed to have got killed the snake and got rid of Serone, but their human enemy captures them. He is looking to catch the second larger Anaconda using his prisoners as bait, and even though they start being strangled they manage to find a way to escape, and it is Serone that turns into the snake's dinner. Terri and Danny manage to trap the snake and burn it alive, only for it to return one more time where they kill it beating it with an axe until it is finally dead, and reunited with Cale they settle on the boat, and ironically they accidentally find the native tribe they had been looking for, and it ends with them filming as they planned. Also starring Danny Trejo as Poacher and Frank Welker as the roars of the Anaconda. There isn't really much you can say about the acting apart from that it is fine from everyone, and it is a very simple concept for a monster style movie, and the special computer generated effects to create the 40 foot Anaconda, or rather a giant garden hose with fangs, are alright, it gets mixed opinions, but I personally don't mind this camp and silly but reasonably fun horror adventure. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst New Star for ""The Animatronic Anaconda"", Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for Voight and ""The Animatronic Anaconda"" and Worst Screenplay. Worth watching!",Anaconda
9,ccthemovieman-1,Forces One To Root For The Snake,5,20 June 2006,"Except for Jon Voight's character, I didn't find any of the actors/characters in this film likable, just annoying. Voight was hardly a role model, either. I wound up rooting for the anaconda. Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde, Jennifer Lopez...all playing people with chips on their shoulders. Sorry, but rappers with attitudes or snobby Englishmen aren't entertaining to me.In here, too, is the all-too-familiar cheap shot against Christians in which they show the worst, most despicable person in the story and then zoom in several times to show you the cross that sleazebag is wearing. They always want to make that association and they make it obvious every time. What makes the movie tolerable at all is the great Brazlian swamp scenery and good special effects with the giant snake. Yeah, sometimes the snake scenes look a bit computer-generated but more than not, they are just plain scary. A few of them are downright jaw-dropping as when it flies through the air, swallows human beings or swims while on fire. This is nice on DVD with rich visuals and very good surround sound.If only the people in the movie were half as good as the scenery.",Anaconda
10,ma-cortes,"Monster movie with action, suspense and adventures on the Amazon",6,12 October 2007,"This stirring picture concerns about a documentary film crew from National Geographic constituted by a motley group: Jennifer Lopez Ice Cube, Eric Stolz, Jonathan Hyde, Owen Wilson, Kari Wuhrer traveling the Amazon river looking for a legendary Indian tribe and guided by Jon Voigh, playing a nutty, snake-obsessed hunter.But a great creature terrorizing the river, it turns to be a very large Anaconda with more 50-foot long. Meanwhile the bunch relationship each other till appearance the enormous snake. A poisonous and giant snake,attack at random and slither down the river, forest, jungle and slither around the boat ready to attack anyone on its path.The picture provides stirring and exciting amusement with hair-raising chills and creepy scares. The Anacandas, themselves , of course, are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly and almost totally convincing.The snakes are made by animatronics and computer generator, as usual. Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming snake food. Rather sympathetic and exaggerated acting by Jon Voight as crazy and nasty snakes hunter. The picture displays atmospheric music score by Randy Edelman and colorful cinematography by Bill Butler, cameraman of ¨Jaws¨film. The movie is professionally directed by Luis Llosa, an expert action movies director (The sniper, The specialist) and habitual shooting on river Amazonas(Fire on the Amazon, eight hundred leagues down the Amazon). It's followed by inferior sequel : The hunt for the blood orchid(2004) by Dwight H.

11,BA_Harrison,How many Hollywood actors does it take to fill an anaconda?,7,17 October 2019,"Jenny's a long way from the block in '90s creature feature Anaconda: the lovely Ms. Lopez is deep in the Amazon, part of a film crew travelling up-river to make a documentary on hidden tribe, the Shirishama. Along the way, the film-makers pick up a stranded snake trapper, Paul Serone (Jon Voight), who puts the whole group in danger in his attempts to capture the world's largest and most deadly green anaconda.Did you know that anacondas can go weeks or months without food after a big meal? This big-budget B-movie dispenses with facts like that in the name of entertainment, it's ravenous reptile eating a whole panther before proceeding to gulp down the crew and passengers of river-boat Micaela-1.Naturally, director Luis Llosa's creature feature is extremely silly stuff, especially with its horribly dated CGI reptile that screeches and moves at lightning speed, but a great cast (which includes Danny Trejo, Ice Cube. Eric Stoltz, Kari Wuhrer, and Owen Wilson) and a snappy pace ensure that the film is consistently entertaining throughout. Voight, in particular, is a blast, chewing the scenery, his villain complete with terrible accent, a greasy ponytail, and a nasty sneer permanently plastered on his face. Check out his cheeky wink when the snake regurgitates his body: he knows exactly what kind of film this is.On a 'scale' of 1 to 10, I give Anaconda a 6.5 (rounded up to 7 for IMDb).",Anaconda
12,Quinoa1984,Cheese in the jungle,6,4 November 2014,"At one time Werner Herzog tried to bring opera/commerce to the jungles of the Amazon with his film Fitzcarraldo, which featured as its primary set piece a boat being dragged over a mountain side. Gone are those days; indeed fifteen years after that in 1997 audiences got just a quick scene of opera being blared in the jungle - this comes after Ice Cube's ""hippity hop"" has played, which actually isn't that bad - while Jon Voight hijacks a small boat of documentary filmmakers (through stealth) to hunt after giant snakes. So it goes.Anaconda was a movie I watched many times when it was on HBO. I probably recognized then it was trash, but it was highly watchable trash, with convincing performances (for what they're asked to do) and some high-grade cheesy lines and mannerisms. Seeing it again today, it holds up as a B-movie blow-out, and is dated mostly by its bad CGI of snakes and has one too many climaxes for comfort. It's one thing when Fatal Attraction does it, but this...It's highly mockable (i.e. Rifftrax took it on live this year), but perhaps the filmmakers knew it? The actors don't seem to, certainly not hapless Owen Wilson - or maybe Voight does, and in his way it's one of the few times, albeit in a total cartoonish performance where he has practically the same grimacing facial expression with Paraguaian accent from start to finish - and maybe that helps elevate it. It's still watchable... which is about the best to say about it, with some competent direction helping along the way - along with some befuddling choices like a Snake-POV camera.Maybe it's best today as a party movie: turn it on, have some brews, and laugh at how that snake just seems to keep coming back and back again (and if it's more than one giant snake, why is it such a big deal?) Oh well... sequels came of this as well.",Anaconda
13,BandSAboutMovies,A fun film,6,11 May 2019,"One of the best movie-going experiences of my life as seeing Anaconda at the dollar show with a rowdy crowd that was screaming at the screen throughout the entire movie. It probably made the actual film a lot better than I remembered, which is how going to the movies should be.Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez in a role that both Julianna Margulies and Gillian Anderson passed on) and her crew are in the Amazon shooting a documentary on the lost Shirishamas tribe.The crew is made up of her childhood friend and camera guy Danny (Ice Cube, who that out of control dollar theater audience made the hero of this movie); Denise the production manager (Kari Wuhrer, who is moving on up here while nearly everyone else is slumming it); sound engineer Gary (Owen Wilson); rich dude Warren (Jonathan Hyde); book captain Mateo (Vincent Castellanos) and anthropologist Professor Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz). Soon, they are joined by a Paraguayan snake hunter - yes, that's a thing - named Paul Serone, who claims he can help them find the lost tribe. Honestly, they should have taken away Jon Voight's Oscar for being in this, as he's the hammiest ham that has ever hammed.Before you can say ""sss"" the titular anaconda and Serone are both vying to kill everyone on the ship. Voight's character is Moby Dick-ing the big snake, using everyone on board to try and grab it. I mean, what other movie has a badly accented Voight dumping monkey blood all over people so that gigantic snakes will attack them? This is also the movie where a snake throws up the corpse of a still shaking Jon Voight, so there's that, too.Danny Trejo shows up for a few moments in the opening and if you need a voice to do the sound effects for the snake, who better than Frank Welker to do it?This was followed by 2004's Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid, 2008's Anaconda 3: Offspring and 2009's Anacondas: Trail of Blood before the franchise did a rare dual series crossover with 2015's Lake Placid vs. Anaconda.This was nominated for nearly every category in the 1998 Razzie Awards, but lost mostly to the Kevin Costner vehicle The Postman. It's not that bad - it's ridiculous but more than willing to entertain you - and even without that dollar movie crowd, you can still find something to enjoy. I mean, it has J Lo in booty shorts before we even knew that was a thing being menaced by a ridiculously huge snake. What's not to love?",Anaconda
14,Coventry,Big Snake Yawn.,4,18 February 2007,"It's pretty damn difficult to impress even the most enthusiast and undemanding horror audiences with a 40 ft. long animatronic snake that  apart from looking silly  also screams at its victims. And yet, strangely enough, the CGI effects & visuals are actually the most pleasing aspects to endure whilst watching ""Anaconda"". The hopelessly muddled script and the awful performances (coming from a prominent ensemble cast, I may add) form the real disaster here. This could have been a pretty cool big animal creature-feature IF ONLY the creators tried a to make it look less like big-budgeted studio blockbuster and more like an unpretentious and cheesy B-movie! Jon Voight surely seemed to think he was involved in such a production, as his performance is permanently over-the-top and almost deliberately bad. Voight blinks ridiculously all the time and talks in an unidentifiable accent, while the rest of the cast attempts to speak their lines straight-faced and plausible. It's almost pitiful to behold. A seven-headed film crew sails down the mighty Amazon river, hoping to shoot a breakthrough documentary about a nearly extinct tribe of natives. Instead of primitive savages, they encounter a stranded adventurer who claims to know all the dangers of the Amazon jungle and offers to be their guide. Patiently and strategically, he (Paul Sarone) directs the crew towards the territory of the horrific man-eating anaconda. After (far too) many lame and predictable false alarm sequences, the big computer-engineered snake finally begins to reduce the number of passengers on the boat. The grotesque action sequences are okay, I guess, but the interactions between the stereotypical characters are totally unbelievable. Eric Stolz (as the expedition's leader) lies unconscious most of the time, Ice Cube stares at the animals in the jungle as they were his gangster enemies from the ghetto, Owen Wilson looks like he wants to ride the anaconda as it was a rodeo-bull and  worst of all  Jonathan Hyde plays the obnoxious British chap who even carries on golfing after several people have died. As strange as it sounds, Jennifer Lopez honestly plays the most convincing character and gives away the best performance. The plot meanders needlessly and contains several situations that are stupid and inexplicable, like unnatural barricades in the middle of the godforsaken jungle and dynamite-induced snake showers. Luis Llosa's direction is uninspired but at least Bill Butler's camera captures some enchanting images of the South American jungles. Despite having appeared in over 40 movies already, Danny Trejo's role is just a miserable cameo.",Anaconda
15,michaelRokeefe,Not just big...a mega sized menace in the Amazon.,4,18 September 2004,"A weak story. Even weaker script. Dialogue disjointed. With all big expectations put aside...an interesting cast jumps, dodges, slides, climbs and swims through a believe it or not fun to watch thriller. The special effects are impressive enough to have you flinching. A film crew featuring Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube and Owen Wilson is deep in the jungle riding the Amazon River searching to film/document a legendary tribe. Not only do they have to contend with snakes of every size imaginable they are commandeered by an obsessed snake hunter(Jon Voight). Voight is forcing the crew to hunt for a 40-foot anaconda that likes to swallow humans whole and for some reason vomits them back out. It is worth waiting for the final fight pitting Lopez and Ice Cube against the ferocious slithering hisser. I found it enjoyable watching Voight's demise. Rounding out the cast are Eric Stoltz and Jonathan Hyde. And yes, even in this mess Lopez is eye candy. Veteran Voight of course seems to be the only real talent.",Anaconda
16,hitchcockthelegend,"Snakes alive, it's a modern day Z movie.",5,2 October 2009,"A documentary crew are travelling down the Amazon to hopefully film a mystical tribe. On the way they rescue a stranded man, unaware of the trouble that his being on board will bring. As they get deeper down river his ulterior motives surface, he's a snake trapper and has his heart set on capturing a giant Anaconda snake. A beast that can grow up to 40 feet long.Ah, creaky creature features, how I love them. Days of old when budgets were minimal and the makers of such pictures just wanted to entertain and hopefully give the discerning viewers a jolt or two, and yes, with the odd giggle thrown in on purpose. Enter the modern day creature feature, where budgets have considerably improved along with the advent of special effects. Where does this leave Anaconda you ask? Is it a modern day homage to the ""good old days,"" or is it a genuine attempt at making a horror film for the modern audience? How you answer that will probably determine how, or if, you enjoy the film.The cast list suggests that the makers thought they were making a great movie, while some of the attempts at a serious performance also lend weight to that theory. John Voight on the other hand clearly knew what was needed and gives a sneering, leering ham sandwich performance befitting those creakers from days of yore. If only the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson and Kari Wuhrer had followed suit, we may have been sitting here with a creature feature to rank alongside the marvellous Tremors, or at the least an equal to the funny Arachnophobia.It's not a desperately bad film by any stretch of the imagination. It's fun playing the ""guess which name actor is going to be snake food next"" and ""who will survive come the end"" While iffy effects aren't really an issue, hey this is a film with gigantic animatronic snakes in it! And for sure some scenes are pure horror hokum delight, watch out for a John Voight wink scene, it's Z movie legend now. But it's neither homage or good horror fodder. Enjoyable enough as an appetiser to far better genre pieces, but ultimately it's very forgettable. 5/10",Anaconda
17,Theo Robertson,"Oh No , It's A Giant Draught Excluder",4,26 June 2004,"As several people have mentioned ANACONDA is a movie that has a very old fashioned feel to it . In some ways it feels like one of those old TARZAN movies where the lord of the apes has to save a bunch of white hunters from a legendary river monster , or it feels like one of those 50 B movies where a scientific expedition are attacked by an unknown assailant like THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON , or it feels like one of those pictures from the 1980s where the John Williams score goes de-de-de-de-de as someone is swimming in the water like JAWS 5 : THIS TIME IT'S A SNAKESee the point I'm making ? ANACONDA is a very unoriginal film that lacks any sophistication ( Why didn't any of the characters pull out a CD and play the classic Throwing Muses track Snakeface for example ? ) and it would have been very boring if it hadn't been for two things 1 ) Jon Voight . Come on you've got a latino bad guy played by Voight and he talks like Bela Lugosi . You've just got to love the way he goes over the top "" Velcome to river Dracula . Now I vill kill you by throwing monkey blood at you "" 2 ) The draught excluder . In long shots the killer snake is obviously a CGI effect but in close ups it's a giant draught excluder . Laugh out loud as the characters are killed by one of those things you stick beside the door to keep the draught out and admire the actors for keeping a straight faceTalking of straight faces Owen Wilson appears in this and he manges to keep a straight face throughout his performance . He escapes from a wild boar - He keeps a straight face . He makes love to a scatty redhead - He keeps a straight face . He gets attacked by a draught excluder - He keeps a straight face . No matter what calamity befalls his character Wilson manages to keep the same exact straight faced expression . It is also the only film Wilson has been in that the best performance DOESN'T belong to Ben Stiller , the draught excluder is by far the best thespian in this movie",Anaconda

19,poolandrews,"""Don't make me out a monster... I didn't eat the Captain"" Terrible dialogue, terrible film.",1,24 April 2005,"Anaconda begins with some red scrolling text that reads 'tales of monstrous, man eating Anacondas have been recounted for centuries by tribes-people of the Amazon Basin,some of whom are said to worship these giant snakes. Anacondas are among the most ferocious -and enormous- creatures on Earth, growing, in certain cases, as long as 40 feet. Unique among snakes, they are not satisfied after eating a victim. They will regurgitate their prey in order to kill and eat again.' Documentary filmmaker Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) & her boyfriend Professor Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz) decide to make a documentary on an Amazonian tribe called the Shiroshama also known as the 'people of the mist'. Along with a cameraman named Danny Rich (Ice Cube), a sound-man Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) & his girlfriend Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer) who's a production assistant & an English host Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde) to present the documentary they set off in a boat along the Amazon river to reach the tribe. On their travels they come across a sinking boat & a stranded man named Paul Sarone (Jon Voight) who claims to be an ex-Catholic priest but is now a snake hunter (don't ask me how someone would make that sort of career decision!). Things start to go wrong for the expedition when Cale is injured by a wasp (again, don't ask) & ends up critically ill. Sarone says he knows the area & can show them a shortcut so they can get Cale back to civilisation quicker & proper hospital treatment. On the way more bad luck follows as they stop to check a run down houseboat possibly for fuel when Mateo (Vincent Castellanos) their Captain, mysteriously disappears. Eventually Sarone reveals his plans & forces everyone on board to help him capture his ultimate prize, a rare 40+ foot long Anaconda that he feels will be worth millions of Dollars. Tension on board heighten, Sarone lures the Anaconda into the open with some bait but only succeeds in getting Gary killed & eaten. As the crew continue to be reduced in number the survivors begin to question who is hunting who exactly...?Directed by Luis Llosa I throughly disliked Anaconda, where did the $45,000,000 go exactly?! Certainly not on the script by Hans Bauer, Jim Cash & Jack Epps Jr. which is atrocious, it's about as clichéd as you can imagine, it's filled with unlikeable stereotypical characters, it has ridiculous plot devices & coincidences to keep the already thin material going, it's unoriginal & predictable as well as taking itself far too seriously. The whole set up is poor, wouldn't Cale notice a huge poisonous wasp in his scuba mask? I think I would. Why does Sarone want to capture this Anaconda? He is never given sufficient motivation in my opinion especially since he murders people without a second thought to achieve this goal. If Anacondas hunt by heat, which is clearly mentioned during the film, why does the Anaconda go for a dead monkey on a line behind the boat? An hours old dead monkey isn't going to give off any heat while being dragged through the Amazon river, is it? I hated the ending as well. I could probably go on all day... The dialogue is terrible & just doesn't work for me, having said that the performances definitely don't help which are all uniformly awful. Even though she is given very little to do Lopez still manages to mess up & is simply awful. Voight puts in an seriously over-the-top performance, that pony tail, that awful accent & what's that facial expression all about Jon? Ice Cube is about as good an actor as someone named Ice Cube could be, the guys as wooden as the Amozonian rain-forest itself. The only decent actor Eric Stoltz is totally sidelined in bed with an injury for most of the film & is ignored. The character of Westridge is ridiculous too as he constantly plays golf on the boat, he must have an infinite supply of golf balls somewhere. Even if it is another example of the poorly written dialogue I did like his line ""the last time I was in water like this I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum"" though. The special effects on the Anaconda itself are mixed indeed. Some of the CGI shots look awful, as do some of the animatronic ones. While others look alright, as I said their a mixed bag. Forget about any gore as there isn't any apart from a quick throat operation involving a knife & empty pen. Generally speaking most of the Brazillian locations look nice & it has decent production values throughout even if there are various mistakes like the famous waterfall goof which is embarrassing to watch as is the changing pick-axe/axe sequence at the end where Danny kills the Anaconda. There is a really cool shot where the Anaconda opens it's mouth in preparation to swallow someone & the camera is placed in the back of it's throat looking out of it's mouth as it stretches open & few shots of the thrashing, burning still alive Anaconda at the end looks quite good as well, but that just isn't enough to save Anaconda from being a blatant & terrible Jaws (1975) rip-off with a large snake instead of a large shark. Anaconda sucks on all fronts, simple as that. There isn't anything I can recommend about Anaconda & I will let the ever awful Jennifer Lopez's (Anaconda was one of her first starring roles) character Terri have the final word ""this film was supposed to be my big break... but it's turned out to be a big disaster"" - never a truer word spoken!",Anaconda

21,zardoz-13,Snake of the Century!,5,11 September 2013,"Watching ""Anaconda is like plastering the palm of your hand against a clear glass jar that contains a rattlesnake and then gambling that you won't flinch when the snake strikes at the glass from within the container. More than half of the audience with whom I sat lost this wager every time that the eponymous snake struck. The ghoulish, B-movie plot of ""Anaconda"" resembles a blueprint for a theme park cruise. Scenarists Hans Bauer, Jim Cash, and Jack Epps, Jr., have borrowed surefire elements and incidents from better movies, such as ""Moby Dick"" (1956), ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954), and ""Jaws"" (1975). Sadly, although it is entertaining in an idiotic kind of way, ""Anaconda"" never seems to enthrall its audience because its campy sense of unreality undercuts its chills.The premise has something to do with journalists on an expedition heading down the Amazon in search of a lost South American tribe of Indians. Expedition leader Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz of ""Killing Zoe"") picks up a shipwrecked survivor, Paul Sarone (Jon Voight of ""Midnight Cowboy""), along the way, but nothing good comes from this act of kindness. Voight turns in a heavily accented performance as an incredibly slimy villain. He is cast as a sinister ex-priest who resembles the feisty Quint (Robert Shaw) in ""Jaws."" Sarone is as obsessed with bagging giant killer snake as Ahab (Gregory Peck) was with catching a great white whale in ""Moby Dick."" Sarone is perfectly willing to use his new friends as bait if necessary to trap his 40-foot snake.A freak underwater accident early on puts Dr. Cale out of commission. It seems that when he dove in to fix a stuck propeller, a poisonous fish swam into his mouth and stung him. Sarone convinces the expedition film director, Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez of ""Selena"") that he knows a short-cut down a blocked tributary that will cut 50 miles off their trip and save Cale's life. Foolishly, Terri believes Sarone and off they steam literally into the jaws of death. Director Louis Llosa and his scribes really heat up the suspense when Sarone commandeers the boat. Our heroes are cut off now in the untamed jungles of South America, and their radio has crapped out on them. They are without help and completely at the Sarone's mercy. Furthermore, during a big snake attack, the reptile knocks most of their fuel overboard so they have to prowl deeper into snake country to find more fuel.Standing out among the trendy-looking cast for his resilience is rapper Ice Cube from ""Boyz N the Hood."" He plays a tough, resourceful, film photographer who joins forces with Terri to thwart Sarone. The rest of the expedition crew are largely victims biding their time until they are eaten.If you don't know an animatronic snake from the real McCoy, or if you think this super anaconda could outrun the Road Runner, you're in for a nightmare experience. Every time this fake anaconda struck, most of the audience with which I sat went berserk. This big mother of a snake slings its coils like so many lariats around its prey. No matter if they're scrambling for a ladder or jogging through the jungle, this lethal anaconda hits them like a twister, wraps around them, and then chomps down on their heads. A pretty sight it is not. Meanwhile, the audiences sheds its collective skin. Maybe it wasn't as terrifying as ""Alien,"" but then my audience wouldn't have known the difference. What really matters in ""Anaconda"" is who will the big, bad snake devour next? And how will our heroes destroy it? Director Louis Llosa, whose helmed better movies such as ""The Specialist"" and ""Sniper,"" exploits the colorful Amazonian flora and fauna as does the snake. Sure, there are the inevitable anaconda cam shots and for the artistically inclined, Llosa provides a grotesque point of view shot. We get to see what it looks like staring down inside of the python's gullet as it digest another victim.Llosa paces ""Anaconda"" like a jack-in-the-box. He cranks up the tension between attacks. Just before his audiences has recovered, he unleashes another attack. And be warned, nothing can stop this anaconda. It can smash through windows, shatter boat hulls, and has special sensing ability that attracts it to its prey. This anaconda also shrieks like a cat when it gets hooked.As horror movies go, ""Anaconda"" is a straightforward, gut and churn classic. Not classic in the sense that it represents superior entertainment. Instead, classic in the sense that it egregious. The only moment in the entire film when the movie makers reach too far is Voight's tacky winking scene. This scene is so hideous that you either howl or hurl. Llosa succeeds in frightening the frijoles out of his audiences with unsavory material. Nothing wrong with that. Any movie that provokes a response is worth watching at least once. The closet that the filmmakers come to sexual encounters is a quickie on the bank that the snake hisses at, and Lopez's wet T-shirt.Despite its glossy, big-budgeted production values, ""Anaconda"" ends up as such a flaky carnival of outlandish special effects and unrealistic antics that you want to snicker when you should scream and scream when you should snicker.",Anaconda

The snake action is of course ridiculous, but you at least jump and get the willies. My main gripe is that there isn't enough action. The snake is supposed to be the main antagonist, but the action doesn't start til after halfway through the movie. Most of the storyline is taken up by filler scenes.

The film was put together for the sole purpose of putting said snake, the type of which is in the very title, on the screen, the justification for such is not... present, and the main reason for choosing to do such a film seems to be the fact that the effects could be achieved in 1997(and, looking back, heck, maybe even looking at it back then, the might have benefited from waiting some). Not all the effects are bad, though. The acting is largely poor. Voight sounds like Jean-Claude Van Damme, and at one point, he even pulls off a move that would have fit more if done by said ""actor"". More or less everyone else is negligible. The writing is set up to make sure the snake can appear. The technical aspects aren't horrible, they're just not particularly impressive. Editing, camera-work and all is flat and uninspired. I suppose some males may be attracted to Lopez and Wuhrer. I'm not sure there particularly is anything for women in this, but hey, if you're a female and you dig the film, that's fine. This is essentially creature-horror for fans of B-movie cinema. I'm not sure anyone else will find anything particularly spell-binding herein. I recommend this to those who fall into the former group. Those wanting a proper portrayal of the reptile, as well as anyone expecting a solid performance from even the most dependable of the actors may want to consider if they wouldn't be better off skipping this one. 5/10",Anaconda

Unfortunately, the directions he gives them turn out to be somewhat misleading and it's then that they realize that he has a hidden agenda which almost immediately imperils all of them. Now as far as this movie is concerned I have mixed feelings about it. I liked the scenery and the presence of Jennifer Lopez who was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress. On the other hand I didn't care so much for the second-rate Al Pacino impression of Scarface given by Jon Voight. Apparently, I am not the only one who was less-than-impressed as he was nominated for a Golden Razeberry Award as Worst Actor. Deservedly so.

27,kannibalcorpsegrinder,An entertaining creature feature,8,15 June 2015,"Heading into the Amazon, a documentary team studying a long-lost tribe runs afoul of a hunter searching for a legendary anaconda and are forced to help him track the deadly creature.This was a decent and quite enjoyable creature feature. One of the better features here is the rather impressive pace that runs throughout here, as this one runs along pretty quickly with the introduction getting started immediately, picking up the hunter is right after that and the snake attacks carry the action throughout the rest of the film. Those action scenes are all quite fun, from the opening poacher attack, the search on the abandoned boat and the first battle with the creature as they try to wrangle the water-bound snake from their boat only for the resulting chaos it it's escape to set the stage for its' later scenes. That is the film's best part which is the final half hour as there's a large amount of ambushes and attacks here, from the trap at the waterfall where there's the fun water-chase with the creature coming after the swimmers in the water trying to dislodge the boat before finally getting to the spectacular waterfall confrontation catching the fleeing victim in mid-air before crashing into the boat below to the greater fun of the big chase through the abandoned warehouse. From the hunter's trap and eventual escape to running through the different levels with the creature continually crashing through the surroundings and finally getting rid of the massive snake in a fiery blast, this packs a large amount of action, suspense and rather impressive moments into it. Along with the enjoyable animatronic special effects for the snake, these are more than enough to hold off the few flaws in here. One of the bigger flaws is the fact that the first half here plays off as more of an adventure film about the exploration of the Amazon who stumbles upon a suspicious snake-hunter who alters their course for his own needs. None of this is handled with the sense of urgency in getting the snake out in a film about a giant killer snake as it moves the film along the needles detours simply to get the point across aren't all that tied into the exploits of a creature feature. There's also the films' tendency to go a little overboard with the special effects here as the use of the CGI snake isn't nearly as convincing as the puppets, act way too slick and have very little depth to it as the performed actions during these scenes give away its' origins. It's not enough to hold this one down, but the other problems here is where the flaws are.Rated PG-13: Violence, Graphic Language and some mild animal deaths.",Anaconda

The furtive man turns out to be increasingly menacing, but there's an even worse problem: A giant anaconda! REST OF CAST: Jennifer Lopez plays the sultry-but-sophisticated film director; Eric Stoltz her boyfriend and anthropologist Professor; Ice Cube the tough cameraman; Jonathan Hyde the posh Brit actor/host; Owen Wilson the sound engineer; Kari Wuhrer his girlfriend and production manager; and Vincent Castellanos the hunky boat skipper.This is a combination jungle adventure and creature-on-the-loose flick and it works well largely due to: A notable cast, a quality slow-build script with increasing tension, and a genuine sense of high adventure, shot on location in the waters of the Amazonian jungles. Until the overblown final act when the cartoony titular reptile joins the cast, the movie's actually realistic and akin to ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and ""Fitzcaraldo"" (1982). Voight is outstanding as the menacing jungle hunter and you really get the sense that the crew is increasingly wary of him.The movie scores well on the female front with Lopez and Wuhrer, but their beauty could've been showcased better. Voluptuous Jennifer, for instance, could have been shown in tight-fitting pants or shorts, although there's a good early shot of her in a short nightgown.

33,JamesHitchcock,The world's first critter film to feature not only a giant snake but also a psychotic defrocked Paraguayan clergyman cum snake-hunter,2,30 October 2009,"""Anaconda"" is a modern example of what might be called the ""critter film"", that sub-genre of the horror film which features a person or group of people menaced by some fearsome creature. This sort of film had at one time a deservedly bad reputation, and some examples, such as the British ""The Blood Beast Terror"" from 1968 (which deals with the exploits of a gigantic bloodsucking moth), must rank as being among the worst films ever made. The reputation of the genre was partially restored by the success of Spielberg's ""Jaws"", but few of Spielberg's imitators have matched that success.The film is set in the Amazon jungle. A film crew are on an expedition to make a documentary about a long-lost tribe of Indians. On the way they rescue a man from drowning in the river. The man tells them that his name is Paul Sarone, that he is from Paraguay and that he was once a priest but is now a snake hunter in search of a giant anaconda. It turns out that he is also a psychopath who seizes control of the group and forces them to assist him in his search. (No good deed goes unpunished).The rest of the film consists of various members of the group meeting a grisly fate at the hands of either Sarone or of the monstrous anaconda, which must make this the world's first critter film to feature not only a giant snake but also a psychotic defrocked Paraguayan clergyman cum snake-hunter.If Spielberg partially rehabilitated the critter film in the seventies, then Luis Llosa has managed single-handedly to relegate it back to the low status it enjoyed in the fifties. One might have thought that a film made as recently as 1997 would feature reasonably good special effects, but those in ""Anaconda"" are including the monster snake itself pathetically unconvincing. According to your ""trivia"" page the CGI cost $100,000 per second. It looks more like $100 for the whole film.The unconvincing effects are matched by some equally unconvincing acting. Jennifer Lopez has given some reasonably good performances in films such as ""Angel Eyes"" or ""Maid in Manhattan"", but at her worst she can be dreadful, and here she is at her very worst, worse even than in ""Enough"", which is saying something. She is totally wooden in this film, wandering though it as though someone (probably her accountant) had suggested that she diversify her career by branching out into acting, without actually explaining to her what acting involves.Ice Cube, another singer seeking to diversify his career, is equally bad. His character is supposedly the cameraman on the film crew, but he more closely resembles an LA gangster mysteriously transported to the Amazon rainforest. (Incidentally, if my surname were ""Cube"" I don't think I would name my son ""Ice"". Is his sister called ""Sugar""?) The Australian-born Jonathan Hyde plays his character as an English upper-class twit straight out of the Monty Python sketch, complete with the sort of accent rarely heard these days outside P.G. Wodehouse adaptations. A young Owen Wilson shows why he has been wise to confine himself to comedy in his subsequent career (although some would say that ""Anaconda"" counts as a comedy, albeit an inadvertent one).Perhaps the most disturbing performance comes from Jon Voight as Sarone. Whereas the other performances are wooden, his is a deliberately over-the-top caricature, hammier than a delicatessen counter, complete with an exaggerated foreign accent. Sarone comes across as like Manuel from ""Fawlty Towers"" trying to do a bad Hannibal Lecter impersonation. Seeing this film it is difficult to recall that, in his early days when he was making films like ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Deliverance"", Voight was regarded as a serious actor; his decline from those days is the reason why I labelled his performance ""disturbing"".I was intrigued to learn that the director is a cousin of the great Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, but unfortunately he does not appear to share the artistic sensibilities of his distinguished kinsman, as ""Anaconda"" is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. It was nominated for what would have been a well-deserved Razzie, but unaccountably lost to ""The Postman"", a vastly better film. (This confirmed my suspicion that the Razzies have less to do with exposing genuinely bad film-making than with cutting some tall poppy, in this case Kevin Costner, down to size). Although the critics mostly shared my dislike for ""Anaconda"", it was a success at the box office, and has attracted numerous ten-star reviews on this board, although I suspect that most of them were written in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. Certainly, it is possible to enjoy the film, but only if one approaches it on the basis that it's so bad it's funny. 2/10",Anaconda
34,StevePulaski,"Intentionally bad, or unintentionally successful?",8,16 October 2011,"I didn't truly start enjoying Anaconda until the final forty minutes of the film. Then once I saw those minutes, I began to enjoy most of the film. It's difficult to do a creature feature well, and I think the film is being unintentionally funny a lot of the time. Especially when the actors it's boasting are Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube. There's almost more to laugh at than be scared of.I have no problem at all with Lopez and Ice Cube. I haven't seen a lot of Jennifer Lopez's work, and I adore Ice Cube in pretty much everything he's in. He's one of those actors where if he's in a bad movie he himself isn't bad the movie, the directing, the screenplay, or whatever setback is bad. I'm just saying that when you see those two playing a couple in a horror film it's hard to take it seriously. Thankfully - they're not the reason this film isn't perfect.The story revolves around a documentary crew, Terri (Lopez), Danny (Cube), Denise (Kari), Gary (Wilson), Warren (Hyde), and Steven (Stoltz), that venture out into the jungle hoping to garner footage of a rare tribe called ""Shirishama."" While traveling on the Amazon River, the crew finds a stranded boater named Sarone (Voight) who knows about the tribe, but acts very unsettling throughout most of the first half.Turns out that Sarone is searching for an anaconda, and is hoping to catch one alive in order to obtain a very large sum of money. He gets the whole crew involved, and doesn't really care who lives or who dies. The thought of being out in the middle of the jungle is creepy - yet it proposes a good campy quality Anaconda hits a high note with.Background scenery is pushed to the foreground here. We get beautiful shots of swamps (yes, swamps), incredible angles of trees, and even some very eerie and suspenseful underwater shots. Director Luis Llosa explores every possible angle of the setting so that not only is this a creepy B movie, but a stylish one as well.When it comes to the snake - the film begins to lose some of its redeeming qualities. There is a scene where very many snakes flood the boat. Unable to distinguish real from fake due to the small stature of the beasts, my only guess is that they were in fact real. When the anaconda makes his first appearance, it looks undeniably animatronic and the CGI used when the beast swallows its first prey is pathetic. Anaconda was made with a budget over $40 million, so this snake's execution is one of two things (1) maybe the hefty budget didn't get them very far after all, or (2, the much plausible explanation) it was supposed to look cheap and fake to give a nod to old creature-features we would've seen Saturday at 10:30pm on Svengoolie.Jon Voight is probably the highest point in the film. His unsettling approach to the crew rubs off on the audience almost making them a little scared as well. His face alone reminds me of Gary Busey on a bad day, or Nick Nolte after one too many. The other members of the documentary crew, like Ice Cube and Owen Wilson, are severely underused, and but their presence is enough for personal satisfaction.The final scene where its two on one with the anaconda is great popcorn fun, and after the film you feel you've spent an hour and a half back in time. Unfortunately, Anaconda was blown out of proportion once the sequel came. After the first two theatrical films were released, the name and story became a Syfy franchise. Currently, in 2011, we have four Anaconda films including this one. I'm sure in five years we'll have two more to go along with it. The bad thing about a good B movie idea is it can be abused with a single sequel.Starring: Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jon Voight, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Jonathan Hyde, and Kari Wuhrer.

36,MovieAddict2016,They're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat...,3,6 August 2003,"What at first appears to be another stupid, B-movie horror piece, is actually...well...a stupid, B-movie horror piece. ""Anaconda"" falls into the cliched zone, the typicality of the situations herein have been done before with lower budgets. ""Anaconda"" is essentially a two-hour repeat of those 1950s films with giant ants attacking cities. What ""Eight Legged Freaks"" (2001) spoofed so finely, ""Anaconda"" simply falls into.The plot, if there is one, has something to do with researchers investigating into a long-lost tribe in the Amazon. They take a boat down the Amazon, through the steamy jungles surrounding, and come across a river rat played by the hateable Jon Voight. ""Deliverance"" aside, Jon Voight has not given a half-decent performance in years. I generally do not like the guy. ""Anaconda"" does not change my outlook on him.The expedition is led by Jennifer Lopez. The other members of the team are Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Kati Wuhrer and Eric ""The Original Marty McFly"" Stoltz. After they pick up Voight on their boat, before you can hum the theme to ""JAWS,"" a massive, forty-foot Anaconda appears, slowly killing off the cast members. There are a lot of big stars in this film, which probably is why it is so darn awful. It is in my opinion that when many stars flock to a given movie, it will turn out to be good (""Mars Attacks!""), or bad (""Gigli""), but never delightable. Never whimsical, original, never enchanting. Save the rare ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" this never happens.
Why must we endure so many ""JAWS"" cash-ins? Steven Spielberg had it right when he didn't return for ""Jaws 2,"" because ""Jaws 2"" wasn't as much a sequel as it was a cash-in. Ever since ""JAWS,"" there have been millions of these creatures-on-the-loose tales. They started sometime in the fifties, but those kind were silly. They were fun to watch. We were laughing with them. ""JAWS"" changed all that, taking itself seriously, but at the same time presenting us with something a bit more acceptable than giant cockroaches attacking Manhattan. Suddenly the Creature Features changed; they started taking themselves seriously, hoping to be as popular as ""JAWS."" I remember a particular film I once saw on AMC about giant ants being bred in a small town by evil geniuses, who had been sprayed by the queen ant and were under her control. That was a very bad movie. But it was funny. I could laugh at it, but to a point that it never got too serious. ""Anaconda"" does get too serious. It gets very serious, then very cheesy, then very dramatic, then tries to be very funny. On the whole, it fails.""Anaconda"" is in-between a lot of bad movies. It doesn't have style, purpose or good performances. Of course this is acceptable given the type of film it is, but the main problem remains that the film has no fun side to it. It isn't funny, laughable, or a guilty pleasure like ""Eight Legged Freaks,"" a film I strongly recommend to the horror lovers out there. No. Instead, ""Anaconda"" isn't laughable but laughably bad. We aren't laughing with it. We're laughing at it. 1.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",Anaconda
37,OllieSuave-007,Typical B-movie.,5,3 April 2014,"This is a typical B-movie where a National Geographic film crew is taken hostage by a mad hunter, who takes them on his quest to the Amazon capture the world's largest and deadliest snake called Anaconda. It features a well-known cast including Jon Voight, Owen Wilson, Jonathan Hyde, Jennifer Lopez and Eric Stoltz.There is really no plot or story to the movie, just a lot of CGI/robotic snake action, the typical monster-chase-victim scenes, lots of screaming and people arguing and fighting one another. There's plenty of action to make the movie breeze by and some cheesy CGI/robotic effects that will make you utter a few laughs, but, unfortunately, it suffers from some plot inconsistencies probably due to editing oversight.

38,sddavis63,"A Weak, Silly Little Movie",3,21 January 2010,"After a somewhat promising start, this movie fizzled out into sheer silliness, replete with poorly developed, one dimensional characters and a horrendously fake-looking snake as the man-eating monster. The promise of the beginning revolved around two things: a surprisingly effective written scroll to open, which describes in graphic detail what anacondas are and what they're capable of, and an unnerving scene of someone obviously under attack from an unseen predator. Those two things combined seemed to set the stage for a rather fun and exciting and potentially scary movie. Unfortunately, at that point the main characters began to be introduced, and we got pulled into a rather silly plot and nothing much about this seemed believable from that point on. The plot - as far as it goes - revolves around an expedition into the Amazon jungle to shoot a documentary about a mysterious tribe, and the relationships between the various folks in the party, headed by Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube. The jungle setting could have been used to better effect, and the truth is that none of the characters are very interesting. Jon Voight eventually comes on board as the somewhat obsessed snake- chaser who'll happily let everyone die in order to get his prize. The movie is replete with breathtaking lines such as ""the jungle makes me horny"" (spoken by Owen Wilson's Gary in a very forgettable performance) and then of course there's Voight's Sarone shouting at Lopez's Terri ""you killed my wild snake."" Perhaps the dumbest scene of the movie was the regurgitation scene, in which Sarone (having been swallowed by the snake a while before) gets regurgitated in front of Terri and proceeds to playfully wink at her while being partially digested and covered in snake slime from the innards of the beast. The biggest weaknesses of the movie, though, are the truly fake looking snake and the lack of any real scares in this. 3/10",Anaconda
39,thesar-2,I have had it with these Motherfucking Bad Looking Snakes in this Motherfucking Bad Movie!,2,13 April 2014,"I'm not blind to see that the filmmakers weren't hoping to make Anaconda more than a B-Movie, but I did see actors acting their hearts out. So, the contradiction made me hate on this movie.Oh, okay, that and the extremely terrible and outlandish actions and visuals of the snakes.I saw this movie many moons ago and possibly saw the first follow-up, which, by the way, is understandably even worse, and never took an interest in seeing it again. But the guys (and gal) over at How Did This Get Made put it on their list, and then, I had to revisit the Amazon once more.Routine, routine, routine this movie was until the snakes arrive. They're (or it might be the inept employees at the CGI camp) so comical that you don't actually get scared. You simply laugh. And I am not just talking 2014 here. I laughed just as equally in 1997 when this arrived. I mean, four years prior was Jurassic Park which effects STILL hold up today. So, NO EXCUSES or PASSES for you Anaconda.Really, this movie boils down to a film crew wanting to capture natives on film in the Amazon, but when one crew member gets ill and another stowaway might be more evil than he appears, things get bad. Like a waterfall that actually shoots water upwards, a double-shot take of characters entering a scene and then immediately entering the same scene, binge-eating snakes, the great Danny Trejo needing a voice over – and a bad one at that, a man-eating snake that, in real-life doesn't actually eat man, costs someone millions and an ending so ridiculous, so hilarious, it's almost worth watching for.Also, I feel bad for one of my all-time favorites, Eric Stoltz. He didn't just phone his performance in, he slept through it.I guess for a Saturday night, we have no plans and we will follow up this movie with a How Did This Get Made recap of the film on Sunday, it would be worth a shot. But, if it doesn't all play out like that, skip it!* * * Final thoughts: Yes, I reference a lot back to Jurassic Park, especially in the 1990s. Truthfully, that Steven Spielberg classic showed us – EVEN TODAY – things do NOT need to look fake if you resort to planning your entire movie around CGI. Later, the Lord of the Rings will prove that an entire world can be as real as ours. So, when I see shitty CGI, such as in this movie, I do NOT forgive them. They just wanted to make this probably $150 million movie on a $12 million budget. Shame!",Anaconda

41,sol1218,"I get sentimental when you hold me tight so come on squeeze me, but please don't tease me",6,30 December 2006,"**SPOILERS** Monster from the deep, the Amazon River, type of movie involving what seems like two giant anaconda constrictor snakes, who measure up to 40 feet each, that are on the prowl. The snakes attack a river barge with a film crew making a documentary about the mythical ""People of the Mist"" a tribe of natives lost to civilization for some 5,000 years called the Shirishama.The movie ""Anaconda"" starts off with what's obvious, with it's title and after the long introduction that we get, a giant anaconda attacking this radio post in the middle of the Amazon basin. The Killer snake has the person at the controls, snake poacher Danny Trejo, so terrified that after trying to hold the unseen serpent off with his hand gun, unsuccessfully, puts it to his head and pulls the trigger.Back on the barge the passengers and their skipper captain Mateo, Vincent Castellanos, start the long trip into the dark and unexplored Amazon Jungle and soon run into this weird Paraguayan river rat who's lost at sea, or in the river, Paul Sarone, Jon Voight. Up until Sarone shows up the movie seems to be going nowhere fast but as he tells the head of the documentary team Anthropologist Dr. Kale, Eric Stoltz, that he knows where to find the ""People of the Mist"" he's given practically cart blanch to do and go where he want's. What Sarone really wants is to sail into dangerous snake country that's been rumored to have a number of giant anacondas mating and breeding there.Sarone is obsessed with the giant anaconda, after almost being eating by one, and wants to captured one of these monsters to sell, and have displayed in the zoo of a major US city, for a cool million if not more dollars. It takes a while for the crew to realize to what Sarone is really up to but as he becomes more and more unstable and shows his true hand by getting a number of the people on the barge, including Captain Mateo, attacked and eaten by this giant anaconda it becomes obvious what Sarone is trying to do: capture with a tranquilizer dart gun the killer anaconda alive! With The persons on board just having enough of the crazy snake obsessed Sarone they band together overpowering and then tying the lunatic up.Lost in the wilderness of the Amazon Basin, thanks to the misinformation given to them by Sarone, the new skipper Englishman Warren Westridge, Jonathan Hyde, accidentally runs the barge aground by this waterfall. Having cameraman Danny Rich, Ice Cube, and the director of the project Terrie Flores, Jennifer Lopez, together with Westbridge go out in the water to dislodge it and then sail home to the waterfront town of Manaus makes things even worse. It's then when we really get to see the giant snake go into action finishing off almost the entire crew and giving Sarone just the chance he needed by strangling, like a giant anaconda, with his legs the film projects assistant Denise Kalberg, Kari Wuhrer, who's guarding him and then make a clean getaway.During all this confusion Danny ends up killing the rampaging giant snake, with a number of basts from a rifle to it's head. Just when you think that the movie is about over, with it's star the big snake dead, another giant anaconda this one bigger and even more aggressive and deadly comes on the scene! You just know that the snake is out looking for a good meal by the way it AGGGGH regurgitates everything that it swallows, man and beast, being that it doesn't consider them to be grade A quality including****SPOILER ALERT*****the wild and crazy as well as dangerous Paul Sarone.Almost unwatchable final sequence that has the big snake have it out with both Terrie and Danny who are being held as bait by the craze Sarone, in order to trap and capture the killer snake, only to have it turn the tables on him by catching Sarone with his guard down, and using up his last tranquilizer dart. Looping Sarone with a number of giant coils the snake then snap crackle and pop the guy to death.There's two more scenes with Sarone and the snake that are so gruesome and at the same time eye opening, and also fascinating, that I just can't find any words to describe them. You'll just have to see them for yourselves and then have your stomach pumped out in order to get you back to normal!Fairly good special effects make the snake, or snakes, look really frightening. The fact that the snakes move, in and out of the water, at lighting-like speeds makes the anacondas even more dangerous in being able to catch their pray, before even throwing their steel-like giant loops around them, and then crushing or suffocating their victims to death. Jon Voight's acting is without a doubt the highlight of the movie, eclipsing even the killer snakes. With a psycho-like grin on his face, that were told was the result of an anaconda trying to swallow him head-first, and what seems like a cheesy German accent straight out of Hogan's Heroe's Voight made every scene that he was in count. Even after Voight was dispatched by the giant anaconda towards the end of the film he still had enough left, or was it that the snake had enough of him, to make a surprise unannounced and final, it's just too much to expect for anyone to even try to think about it, guest appearance!",Anaconda

43,lost-in-limbo,Who gives the best 'snake' performance?,5,20 August 2009,"You feel like watching something considerably lazy, 'Anaconda' might just be up your alley. The heavy-backed production is Hollywood gloss (just look at the familiar cast, its grand scope and special effects) with a poorly thought out gimmick, but its materialistic concept is a b-movie at heart. Quite a humidly straight-forward creature runs amok through an adventurous trip get-up, but where it should be having fun with itself (where the script throws in some lousy tongue-in-cheek remarks), everything is done in a serious tone (but it's hard to take it so). Although with the exception of a shadily camped-up Jon Voight doing his best snake hunter impression ah actually with his creepy facials (look at those flickering eyes and grimace) and slithering movement you could easily mistake him as the role of the anaconda. Well in the end he's just as dangerously devious! Its push for A-grade treatment is obvious, but better than it probably deserved. Slick direction by Luis Llosa, vividly lush jungle locations (though there's some potent sets in use), smooth camera-work and a leering concentration on the special effects. Mixing together CGI and animatronics with indifferent results, however the latter being better implemented. Jennifer Lopez leads the way (in a rather commending role) with the likes of Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Jonathan Hyde, Kari Wuhrer and an under-used Eric Stoltz doing modest jobs. Nonetheless its Voight's show! Even with this uneven stash, the material is ponderously clichéd and not as exciting as it should have been. The snake attacks are ridiculously brought across (just look at the outlandish climax), but remain fun even though the attempted jolts are weak and tension never arises. This could be attributed to its pattern of getting bogged-down on some very long-winded and tepid dialogues that stereotypically rob it from being consistently fun.Disposable amusement.",Anaconda
44,bowmanblue,Great nineties monster-munching fun,7,1 November 2018,"There are a lot of 'monster-munching' films and most are pretty bad and don't leave any impression on you whatsoever. 'Anaconda' is not one of those. Although it offers absolutely nothing new in terms of... well, anything, it's still entertaining enough to stick in your mind and not make you think you wasted an hour and a half of your life watching it. As you might imagine, 'Anaconda' is about a snake - a pretty damn big one! A crew of people (do you care about most of them? Do you really need to wonder what's going to happen to most of them?) are travelling down a river that's well off the beaten paths of the Amazon because they're doing something that requires them being there. Again, do you care? They could be filming a documentary. They could be researching the meaning of life. All you need to know is that a load of disposable characters are cut off from civilisation and at the mercy of one nasty slithering menace. And J-Lo!I've pretty much summed up everything you need to know about the film in the opening paragraph. If you're a fan of 'good bad-movies' then you'll probably enjoy it, but there are definitely a few things that need to be mentioned. Namely casting... A practically unrecognisable Jennifer Lopez headlines the film and - amazingly if you've seen 'Gigli' - gives a reasonable enough performance when compared to other output in the genre. She's part of the team that consists of Ice Cube, the most British Britishman you've ever seen (or 'discount Richard E Grant' as I like to call him), Owen Wilson (before he was well-known), the ginger guy from 'The Fly II,' a handful of others who are even less memorable and therefore will end up disappearing down the snake's throat. And Jon Voight - as the snake.No, Jon Voight doesn't really play the snake (I'll get to that later). However, he basically plays a snake in human form. Or at least that's my conclusion based on the amount of 'hissing' he seems to participate in during his time on screen. He actually plays a 'snake hunter,' but, if the snake is the film's 'true star' then he is certainly the second best person on screen in terms of sheer entertainment. The snake itself is (primarily) computer-generated and I remember watching this in the cinema back when it was released in 1997 and thinking, ""Wow! That's amazing special effects!"" Sadly, the effects haven't faired that well in the twenty or so years since this was released and you'll have to be a little bit more forgiving when watching (you'll probably see better CGI on your average cereal advert these days!).Basically, if you like silly, slightly campy, monster-munching films, you should enjoy this. It knows what it is and never really tries to be anything else. Don't expect too much in terms of character development or revolutionary story-telling and you won't be disappointed. The only thing you may be disappointed about is if you sat down to watch this film based on Danny Trejo's name. Yes, he is in it... but only just!",Anaconda
45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Snakes are a pain!,6,30 September 2006,"It's not in every movie that John Voight gets to impress us with the size of his snake. And it's not often I make bad jokes like that. I apologize. In fact, when I saw this in the cinema, the audience was in fits of laughter at the very first sight of said beast.A National Geographic film crew travel down river to the deepest depths of the Amazon jungle in search of a mythical tribe of large-breasted naked women, or something. On the way, they pick up a hitchhiker whose boat has been wrecked in a storm. Big mistake! The hitchhiker is Paul Sarone (John Voight, hamming it up so heavy he's almost sponsored by Danish), hell-bent on capturing a 60-foot snake that's lurking in the water.The rest of the crew tries to stand up against him, but his sneer is obviously too scary to fight against. Ice Cube plays the typical homebody from South Central; Jonathan Hyde is the typical English gent; Jennifer Lopez is the typical tough babe; Owen Wilson is a dufus, as always, and Kari Wuhrer - infinitely prettier than Lopez - provides a decent distraction from the hungry reptile.In the tradition of horror-in-the-jungle movies, the victims get knocked off, one by one. Sometimes the anaconda looks real and when it doesn't, the effects are iffy, indeed. The plot works up to a predictable climax, with a big bang, to satisfy the audience.It's hard to believe this film went straight to No. 1 at the US box office. It's simply awful, but has such a hey-ho charm and a who-gives-a-damn attitude that it makes for decent popcorn fare. The script is chockablock full of clichés and most of the laughs are unintentional. But entertainment is entertainment, nevertheless, and Anaconda provides enough of it. How can you refuse a movie that offers a POV shot of inside a snake's belly? How on earth the producer managed to assemble the actors he did, when the characters are no more than snake fodder, is unreal.

The movie is advertised as a monster movie and the plot only exists to keep the critics happy. I myself didn't think much of it. The suspense was there but I spent most of the time trying to work out who was going to die. As is typical, the injured guy doesn't die and the woman doesn't die. The black guy (Ice Cube) didn't die either, but then if I were making a movie I wouldn't kill the cool black guy. What plot there was dealt with a television crew travelling up the Amazon to catch footage of a lost tribe. On their way they meet a guy whose boat has broken down. He is a snake hunter and knows of the tribe they are looking for. He has an ulterior motive though, he wants to capture a giant snake and will do anything to get it. Thus the movie dodged between a mad hunter trying to kill the crew and a monster snake trying to kill the crew. I thought the snake sucked. It wasn't scary and I wasn't holding my breath when it attacked. It did manage to swallow people whole, but beyond that I wasn't impressed. There wasn't much in the way of redeeming features and the only theme that I got out of the movie was how we have not truly tamed nature, but I think there are far better movies, such as Titanic, that portray that theme.",Anaconda

During a storm, they rescue a man, Paul, from his stranded boat. From the onset, things seem a bit off with Paul, and soon becomes the film's antagonist. Oh, off course, the Anaconda is also an antagonist, but the giant snake doesn't really make an appearance until well into the film. I actually found the suspense and mystery so interesting that it didn't even matter that there was no snake during the first half. It was a nice build up to the horror that was to follow.The characters were a bit stereotypical and none of them really stood out as memorable, except for Paul, maybe, with an eerie performance by Jon Voight. We see Owen Wilson in a serious role and I liked him here. I loved Jonathan Hyde as Westridge, who mainly served as comic relief, but did a darn fine job. Ice Cube should stick to singing (even though I don't like rap), as I've never really viewed him as a serious actor. Eric Stoltz's character, Steven Cale, was absent for most of the movie, having been injured early on in the movie.

50,merklekranz,Fitzcarraldo it's not but entertaining it is...,6,15 June 2007,"The barge slowly making it's way along the sinuous jungle river with music playing, evokes memories of Klaus Kinski's visionary quest in Fitzcarraldo. In fact, John Voight's insane effort to trap a 40 ft. anaconda is slightly similar to Kinski's vision of dragging a steamship over a mountain in Fitzcarraldo. That however is where the similarities end. Anaconda is a monster movie masquerading as an adventure film. The huge snake could have just as easily been in a cave as the jungle setting. There is nothing original about Anaconda, but somehow the result is equal to, or slightly better than the sum of it's parts. Don't expect too much, and Anaconda will entertain. - MERK",Anaconda
51,Movie Nuttball,Great movie! Jon Voight is excellent!,10,11 October 2004,"This film, Anaconda is a very good film in My opinion. The cast is different and they all acted well which this cast includes Jon Voight, Eric Stoltz, Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde, Owen Wilson, and Kari Wuhrer. As I said all of the actors are good but Voight's Paul Sarone is one of the coolest and meanest I have ever seen and he is one of My favorite villains in a movie. Those looks he gets on his face are something else! He is enough to scare a super hero! I think that this is Voight's best role! The music by Randy Edelman is in My opinion one of the best musical scores for a movie. The snakes look very realistic and the directing by Luis Llosa is very good. I have always like this film because of its great acting by Jon Voight, the special effects, great musical score, and lots of excitement! If you like Jon Voight, J. Lo, giant snake movies then I strongly recommend Anaconda!",Anaconda
52,Floated2,Entertaining B Movie,7,22 September 2018,"Anaconda was released in 1997 and was described as a simple minded B level movie. The film does what it is required to do which was entertain.

55,videorama-759-859391,Snake-tastic,8,11 June 2014,"Anaconda comes off better than just an action horror film. Yes it's a horror, pick one by one off victim affair, but it actually comes off better than others of it's type. It's very suspenseful, and doesn't go straight into the kill. No we're left in great suspense, where at the start, a suicide of a familiar ugly Mexican dude holds us over, prefore to the movie's story. A doco crew led by Stoltz, again miscast, are out to catch the largest Anaconda, and film it. Good luck with that, as they never anticipated the monstrosity of the one, lurking around the rivers of the Amazon. Owen Wilson, before becoming known, plays a serious role here too, and Jon Voight shows great menace as a rich snake hunter/cold blooded psychopath, in one shocking breakneck scene, ending one of the crew while J Lo as Stoltz's girlfriend, turns up the sexy heat. Watching this reptile go nuts is half the fun of the film, to see something this big is truly eye popping, Voight while being suffocated by it, actually winks before he expires. Yes it is a bit far fetched, but you go into these movies to be scared a thrilled, and the films succeeds in both, as to that awful Snakes On A Plane. Truly a worthwhile view if not having seen this original, which in almost nearly every case, you can't beat.",Anaconda

However since I went to a University in '97, I used to them now. The non-poisonous ones. ""Anaconda"" is a the movie that gives you true rush of adrenaline when you watch it. Star-studded action-packed goodness is what you get, and there's a little education in it too. Jon Voight with a ponytail? Anything can happen. J. Lo, Owen Wilson, Eric Stolz(Mask), Ice Cube, etc. who could ask for anything more? I like everything the movie showed, even the tracheotomy that Paul(Voight) performed. The menacing anaconda was the real deal. The graphics were unbelievable and the part where it ate one of the victims, it was creepy. Depite of it all it was one of the best snake films I've even seen. Now its best to understand snakes, the anaconda is the one snake I must truly avoid, AT ALL COSTS!

So I won't talk about the suspense, the horror, or the terror ~I~ felt when watching this, just to be fair.Owen Wilson delivered the only natural performance in this production. Jennifer Lopez frankly reeked, as did Ice Cube. John Voight was good, but not up to par, in my opinion. There are some excellent action sequences, and some decent and funny dialog, and the story flows with an adequate pace. The effects, especially those of the snake itself, are really quite good, and show an inspired use of that $35M budget.My favorite scene? There is a shot from the ground, of a guy jumping from an extreme height. Just as you think, ""Yeah! He's gotten away!"" the anaconda comes out of nowhere and snatches him right out of mid-air. That was impressively shot and executed, and was (in my opinion) the highlight of the whole movie.It is considered a ""B"" movie, yet carried a $35M budget?! How, by any consideration, does that qualify this movie as a ""B"" flick? That's an ""A"" budget, and so it will be rated as such.It rates a 4.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Anaconda

The film crew will be used as bait to catch this treasure...or will the anaconda catch all of them? This movie is directed by Luis Llosa (The Specialist) and stars Jennifer Lopez (The Cell), Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy), Ice Cube (Friday), Jonathan Hyde (Titanic) and Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction). Anaconda is one of those movies every time you watch it you wonder if the cast knew how bad it was while it was getting made. The random accents and strange dialogue by Voight and Hyde are painful. Ice Cube is funny in this and almost makes it enjoyable. Lopez is fine and delivers her part well, for what it's worth. The snake and CGI in this is dreadful. Absolutely miserable. It's painful to watch every time it appears. This is a horror film you only need to see once, and maybe not even that many time. I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it.",Anaconda

The movie's story features a an extra-large creature but instead of a huge gorilla, this movie has a huge snake - and no Fay Wray. Now, the snake is angry, but can you blame it? It's a snake, and man has infringed on its territory. The acting is not bad and Jon Voight proves that he can transform a poor script into something that at least is credible. And Jennifer Lopez proves that she is a good actress. But Mr. Voight is the star of this movie and for that reason, this movie is watchable. But this movie's message is clear: keep away from the snake, and admire it from a safe distance because if you get too close, it could ruin your vacation.",Anaconda
61,smatysia,"J.Lo.'s beauty, Voight's camp make for entertaining flick.",7,10 September 2001,"My point of view is that anything with Jennifer Lopez in it is worth watching. Her beauty and charm come through in this film like all her others. OK, aside from J.Lo., there were some good things and some bad things about this flick. It's sort of a cliche now, but it holds true here, that most of the actors are gobbled up in reverse order of billing. Eric Stoltz was unconscious for most of the movie, so he was a non-factor. Ice Cube turned in a pretty darned good performance here. True, the parts he plays are basically all the same, but I don't know if that's due to his lack of range, or if that's all the parts he gets offered. Kari Wuhrer was quite good, she definitely deserves to move up from the late-night cable T&A fare.
Beautiful photography of the rain forest. But the snake effects were often pretty cheesy. I guess they couldn't afford Industrial Light & Magic, so they went with Sony's FX company, and it showed badly.
But what made this film was Jon Voight's performance. Yes, he played the role with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and he did it masterfully. What some people don't seem to get, is that Voight's part deliberately aims for camp, and scores a direct hit. It must have been tremendous fun for him.",Anaconda
62,jimbo-53-186511,"A pretty bad film? Yes, but Voight prevents it from being completely awful",3,23 February 2015,"A film crew sets sail along the Amazon to film a documentary on the 'People of the Mist'. Along the way they stumble across Paul Serone (Jon Voight) an expert 'snake trapper' who is stranded at the side of the river claiming that the propeller broke on his boat. Serone is seemingly helpful at the beginning, but as the journey unfolds his real 'persona' starts to come through putting the whole crew in danger.The premise for this film is good on paper and seems to be a cross between King Kong and Dead Calm. Unfortunately, it is more Dead Calm than King Kong (I didn't like Dead Calm, but this film is definitely worse). The film attempts to be thrilling and exciting the problem here is that you can predict the outcome of everything way before it happens meaning that there isn't really any suspense. The worst example of this is Serone's re-appearance after the surviving members of the crew thought they'd killed him (like a classic pantomime villain). The dialogue was fairly dull and clunky with only the odd exchange between Ice Cube and Jonathan Hyde resembling anything remotely funny or interesting.The writing in this film is at best inconsistent and at worst awful; as the narrative unfolds Serone starts to pick off the crew one by one, but early on Cale is on the verge of dying, but Serone opts to save him by cutting a hole in his throat or windpipe in order to allow the poison to seep out (I think), but why keep him alive? It may have been to buy Serone time to trick the crew into believing that he's directing the crew to a hospital, but it seemed a long winded and stupid way to co-ordinate his plan. It also means that he'll always have one more person that he needs to kill. Another good one is when he says that the snakes have heat sensors to enable them to be able to detect humans in the water, but yet Serone walks through the water himself at one point. If he knew that they could detect heat then why did he walk through the water himself and risk getting himself killed? Was Serone perhaps on a suicide mission or was that just a dumb piece of writing? I'm inclined to believe the latter.Voight was easily the best thing about this film; his constant mugging and grimacing in front of the camera was just a joy to watch. It's almost like he was saying to himself 'I'm too good for this trash' and he'd be right. I wonder if he'd modelled his own performance on that of Robert De Niro's performance in Cape Fear. The only other person who came close to being as good to Voight was Hyde but even he fell a long way short. The rest of the cast put in sub-par performances with many of the crew merely being fodder for the snakes.To sum it up then it's a pretty dreadful film with only Jon Voight attempting to give it any semblance of fun and excitement. Taking Voight out of the equation you're left with a film with very little else that's good about it.",Anaconda
63,lukem-52760,"A FANTASTIC JUNGLE ADVENTURE HORROR,BIG NOSTALGIA LOVE FOR THIS CLASSIC OF THE 90'S!!!",10,18 January 2019,"Anaconda is such a fun thrilling 90's monster movie & one that i remember being a big summer hit movie when i was growing up in the 90's & i got it on video & loved it!!!
To me ""Anaconda"" is simply a ""Classic"" of that beautiful era of mine the 90's, i have huge love & Nostalgia for this great summertime monster movie, i still remember the trailers fondly & i remember it being a big summer hit at the cinema, to me Anaconda is one my favourite movies of the 90's it's that good in my opinion!!!
These big budget creature features seemed to make a comeback during the 90's with other flicks like ""Deep Blue Sea"" ""Congo"" ""Jurassic Park"" ""The Lost World"" ""The Relic"" ""Mimic"" ""Lake Placid"" & more, i like all these fun films but i would place ""Anaconda"" at the very top, Anaconda has such a nice mix of Jungle Adventure & Monster Horror as well as such a Cool ensemble cast, this is a ""B-movie"" with A+ Production,Music,Cinematography, Cast & creature design.
Others may find the cast abit Cheesy but i don't agree at all & even if it is that would only add to it's pure 90's time period, as it is the cast is great & each familiar & popular 90's star Face adds to it's Charm & sense of time & place like back when Jennifer Lopez & Ice Cube were very Hot property!!!
Times have changed & in my eyes it's nice & comforting to revisit that time of my childhood with this great entertaining Horror adventure.
The Cast is great:
Jennifer Lopez is great here as a tough hero & gives a very good solid performance, probably the best I've seen her do & takes charge alot & is smart.
Ice cube is always good in movies & again is great here as a main character among the very good line-up ensemble cast, he stands out among the group as cool serious & heroic.
Owen Wilson in an early younger role before he became a huge comedy star is good here & is funny,chilled out & sometimes the silly & not very smart one of the group.
The legendary Jon Voight is excellent here & gives a fantastic menacing & evil performance as a nasty Snake hunter ""Paul"" who wants to use the documentary team as bait to hunt a giant Anaconda & really creates one of the best bad guy villains I've ever seen, especially of the 90's!!!
Eric Stoltz is an ok lead at the beginning but then an accident happens & he's pretty much bed ridden for the rest of the movie so he has very little impact as a character.
One of my fave B-movie actors has a fun little role at the beginning of this Horror Adventure ""Danny Trejo"" & that's a cool little cameo that sets up the suspense,fear & mood of this piece.
Have to also say how beautiful the look of the Amazon rainforest is captured on film with the stunning cinematography & to add to the lovely scenery backdrop we have a beautiful almost sad & lost musical score that really captures the haunting beauty of the Amazon & the lost feel of the characters that are way out of their territory.
Anaconda is a fun,exciting,thrilling jungle Horror adventure & with that old school pure 90's feel & tone to it & it's a special movie to me for Nostalgia reasons & genuinely Being a great adventure with BRILLIANT practical snake fx & only abit of c.g.i here & there to give the snake speed really but it doesn't take over the entire movie like todays c.g.i obsessed movies are, here the big snake is the right balance of practical & c.g.i so it doesn't look silly it looks very cool.The tone is often fun & full of adventure & then flips to Horror territory when the massive snake turns up, great fun & a lovely relaxing late night movie.
A great adventure & the type they really don't make anymore, one of my most personal favourite movies of all time, a real Gem but really should be a Cult Classic but to me it's much more.",Anaconda
64,davispittman,Iffy Jennifer Lopez movie,7,3 January 2016,"I mainly watched this because I love Jennifer Lopez movies. I always like seeing her act. Ice Cube joins her in this movie, and I liked him alright, not the best, but he was OK. Jon Voight was pretty good in this movie, he played his menacing character well. The special effects were iffy, some shots looked fake, while others were just fine, so like i said, it's iffy. I did enjoy the scene where Jon Voight's character was eaten, that was fun and cool to see. Owen Wilson didn't really work well in this movie, I didn't enjoy his acting at all. Hid acting seemed kinda fake and phoned in. I expected to hate every second of this movie, but I was surprisingly entertained by it, especially through about the last half an hour or so. Jennifer Lopez and her love interest had really great chemistry too, they worked well together and you could totally buy their romance. Overall, this movie did end up entertaining me, and I was very pleased with the ending and the outcome of everything. This movie is really just mindless fun. If you can overlook Owen Wilson and a few shots of bad CGI, I think you should enjoy it just fine. 7/10 for Anaconda (1997).",Anaconda

66,ferbs54,Hard To Swallow,7,30 April 2020,"The unvarnished facts regarding the anaconda, the world's largest and heaviest snake, are disconcerting enough ... particularly the one species of the four known as the giant, or green, anaconda, aka Eunectes murinus. These monsters can grow to a length of nearly 30 feet and weigh in excess of over a quarter of a ton. They live for around 10 - 12 years in the wild, mainly in the watery regions near the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers in South America, and subsist on a diet of fish, turtles, pigs, jaguars, deer and other wildlife ... up to 40 lbs. of small wildlife a day, one solid meal satisfying them for weeks. Of course, for most people, the most salient and scarifying feature concerning these beasts is their ability to constrict the life out of their victims, after which they consume their dainties whole. Truly, a creature to be feared and avoided, despite their nonpoisonous nature. And, to be sure, an animal that would make prime fodder for any self-respecting horror movie, sticking to those actual, real-life characteristics. A film that veers wildly into the fantastic as regards these jungle dwellers, however, is the 1997 film called simply ""Anaconda,"" which turns them rather into some impossible and fantastic fantasy creation straight out of the nightmare visions of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age. More on this in a moment.In the film, the viewer encounters the members of an expedition that is currently sailing upriver from Manaus, Brazil, in the hopes of filming a documentary on the elusive, legendary tribe known as the Shirishama. Members of the sailing barge include the project's director, Terri (Jennifer Lopez, whose breakthrough film ""Selena"" had just been released one month previously, in March, and whose 1998 film ""Out of Sight"" would really propel her into the public consciousness); cameraman Danny (Ice Cube); anthropologist Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz); a David Attenborough-type narrator, Warren Westridge, a thoroughly obnoxious jerk who turns out to be rather heroic (Jonathan Hyde); sound engineer Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson); production manager Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer); and skipper/guide Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). Their journey barely gets under way before things start going wrong. Another river craft is encountered with a fouled propeller, and its sole occupant, Paraguayan snake hunter Paul Serone (Jon Voight), is allowed to come aboard. Serone tells the others that he can help them find the mythical land of the Shirishama, but disaster soon strikes when Cale is disabled in an underwater accident (a wasp had somehow become caught in his throat), forcing Serone to perform an impromptu tracheotomy of sorts on him. Cale is now in desperate need of hospitalization, and so Serone shows the others a shortcut back to civilization. But, as things turn out, the wily snake hunter has an agenda of his own, and steers our heroes into a region where resides another legend: an enormous anaconda that Serone wishes to capture and sell for a fortune. But as things soon develop, that enormous snake has decided that it is the one who will be doing the hunting here...As I said, the anaconda is a fearsome enough critter in its own right, and had the filmmakers decided to stick with the universally dreaded night crawler that the world knows as an actuality, then things might have gone better here. Instead, we are given an animatronically created monster that is never wholly believable ... at least, it wasn't for this viewer. Numerous incidents arise in the film that are, you should pardon the expression, pretty hard to swallow. For instance, whereas the top speed for an actual anaconda is something on the order of 1 mph, the creature here moves at lightning speed, and is capable of grabbing a victim who is free-falling from a great height. (Granted, the suspense quotient to be had with a creature that could be easily outrun by even the most out-of-shape American would be an admittedly low one.) And as I mentioned up top, whereas a normal anaconda should be sluggish for a good couple of weeks after one solid meal, the one on display here is absolutely voracious, feeding on victim after victim after victim. Well, perhaps that is because the snake that we are given here, rather than being 28 feet long (the greatest length ever recorded for an anaconda), is much much longer. The net result, thus, is a creature that feels like one of those in a 1950s sci-fi film; a radiation-mutated horror of some kind hidden out of sight in the jungle depths, a la the giant wasps in 1957's ""Monster From Green Hell."" Not that there's anything wrong with that kind of conceit; I happen to love those '50s sci-fi creatures. Unfortunately, the monster here just feels patently phony, although not nearly as ersatz as the constrictor that 007 went up against in ""Moonraker."" Compare it, for example, to the deadly boa in the 1933 pre-Code wonder ""Murders in the Zoo,"" which came off as hyperrealistic and thus twice as terrifying. But ""Anaconda"" has other problems besides these. Several of the characters do really stoopid things here (I'm thinking of Gary and Denise, who go off into the nighttime jungle for a little makeout session! I mean, really? I wouldn't want to step off of that barge during the daytime!). Even worse, it was just impossible for me to determine whether or not our band of adventurers was fighting one indestructible snake monster or several. Terri seems to effectively kill the creature midway through the film by firing point blank several times into its gaping maw, so perhaps there were two of them? Or more? There really is no way to tell.Fortunately, the news is not all bad here. ""Anaconda,"" despite the patent implausibility of its central adversary, is undeniably a lot of fun, and the film is nicely compact and moves along briskly. Peruvian director Luis Llosa shoots his picture with style and manages to ratchet up the suspense nicely, withholding our first establishing shot of the monster even though we see something endangering a poacher (future ""Machete"" star Danny Trejo) and easily dispatching a black panther early on. And Llosa gives us several imaginative shots that really are tours de force. In the first, we see our anaconda swim by underwater, the body and face of its latest victim (yes, Gary) protruding from its swollen belly. And in the second, even more flabbergasting shot - one for the books, really - we the viewers are inside the snake's body, looking outward, as its latest victim is drawn inexorably inward! The film on the whole looks fantastic, with spectacular Amazonian scenery throughout: It was indeed shot in Manaus (which, beautiful enough as it is, is a locale that I hope to avoid at all costs!), as well as in the Arboretum of Los Angeles County, of all places. And it offers up several nicely turned performances. J-Lo, I am happy to report, is surprisingly effective here as the spunky Terri; she is wholly credible and convincing, as well as sexy and appealing. Best of all, though, is Jon Voight as the snaky snake hunter Serone. Love it or hate it (and many people have derided this performance over the years ... a performance that was ultimately nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award, ultimately losing to Kevin Costner in ""The Postman,"" by the way), this bit of thesping will long linger in the viewer's memory. Voight here is completely over the top as the demented anaconda hunter, and it should perhaps be no surprise that the old pro handily steals the film from his less seasoned performers. His Serone, of course, follows very much in the footsteps of Robert Shaw's Quint character in the 1975 blockbuster ""Jaws,"" although Serone is far, far more deranged, dangerous and unpredictable. It is a delicious role for Voight, actually, and he runs with it gleefully.""Anaconda"" was produced on a budget of $45 million and returned almost $140 million at the box office; this monster film was thus a monster smash hit. Thus, it should perhaps be no surprise to learn that the film spawned a belated sequel seven years later, ""Anaconda: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,"" which features no characters from the original film (small wonder, as most of the original crew members from the first movie wind up in the snake's distended belly by the time the final credits roll!). This second film apparently takes place in Borneo, even though anacondas exist nowhere else on Earth other than South America. Based on my experiences with this first film, in what turned out to be a lengthy series (the third through fifth films being straight-to-video affairs), I am in no great rush to look at that first sequel, although I am curious to see how the filmmakers go about explaining the presence of anacondas in Southeast Asia. Snakes on a plane, perhaps?",Anaconda
67,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Creature Feature/Nature Run Amuck Film,7,4 August 2019,"This film was one that I'm pretty sure I caught on the movie channels not too long after it was released. I've always been a fan of these creature feature films where animals attack humans. I've seen this one a handful of times and will acknowledge, it isn't great, but its definitely a lot of fun for sure. The synopsis here is a ""National Geographic"" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest, and deadliest, snake.It all begins in a boat on the Amazon River. There's a poacher (Danny Trejo) that's trying to call for help on a radio, but he cannot raise anyone. We see through the eyes of something that chases him up the radio tower on his boat. While up there, he kills himself with a hand gun.We then shift to a documentary film crew that is going down the Amazon. They are looking for a Native American tribe that lives in the remote jungle. The director of the film crew is Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez). She has a past with a doctor of anthropology, Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz). It seems they've lost touch, but this trip might help to rekindle. He's an expert on tribes that live in the Amazon. Terri's camera man is Danny Rich (Ice Cube), her sound guy is Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) and the production manager is Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer). The man on camera and narrator is Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). He is kind of rude, as he tells Denise to take his bags to his room, which she informs him that isn't her job.Their barge is captained by Mateo (Vincent Castellanos). Early on we learn the different aspect of the characters. Hyde is uppity and has refined tastes, bringing expensive wine and golf clubs. Wilson and Wuhrer are seeing each other, with both of them acting somewhat childish about it.As they begin their journey, they find a boat that is tangled some roots. The stranded man is Paul Serone (Jon Voight). He tells them that he is a snake catcher, which Terri calls him out for being a poacher. There is a moment where Serone and Mateo look at each other, which they seem to know who the other is, but nothing is shared. Serone just asks if they can take him to the next village so they can help him free his boat.It actually turns out that they have might need to work together. Serone reveals that he knows the tribe of Native Americans they are looking for. He offers to help him. He doesn't reveal what he is actually trying to do though. The barge comes upon a snake totem and Serone suggests they take a path at a ford. Dr. Cale disagrees, stating that his logic is off and that way should be flooded. They take the other route.Their barge gets stuck in some foliage and Dr. Cale goes into the water to free them. Before he can, he panics and begins to convulse. When he is brought back on the barge, his mouth is opened to reveal a wasp. It is large and poisonous. He can't breathe due to the stings, but Serone saves his life by giving him a tracheotomy with a knife and a pen casing. It is then decided that they have to go down the ford he said if they want to get to a hospital in time to save Dr. Cale.The problem is that this other way is blocked by a wall. Serone has dynamite and wants to blow it up. Terri contends that the wall is there for a reason and that they do not know what. She is overruled to save Dr. Cale's life. We end up in the area where we saw the poacher in the beginning, but there's something else that is stalking them in the wild.As I stated above, I've seen this film a handful of times. It definitely is a fun film, but it also has its flaws. I do really like the premise though. It isn't anything new as we've been seeing films with this idea for a long time. I like that a documentary film crew is going to the wilds to try to find this tribe. Even more than that, I do believe that we could get giant animals like this in isolated areas. It really is quite believable, especially with how difficult these places can be to reach. I like that there's no genetic engineering or anything man has done to influence them, this is just nature allowing it to do its thing.I really like the idea of Serone as well. He plays on the crew's gullibility. He's lived in these areas for awhile so he really knows things that they don't. When Dr. Cale is incapacitated, there is really no one to check him. He only reveals what you need to know as well. Going even farther, there is an interesting dynamic with Westbridge. He is very rude when he first comes aboard the boat. This is flipped when Serone takes over by commanding him around. I really dug that. There is also another interesting one as we see that stress ruins society. Gary sees what Serone is saying and joins in with his logic. If you know me, I'm nihilistic and it doesn't take much for society to break.I want to move now to the pacing of the film, which is where I think there are some issues. The film only has a runtime of 69 minutes. It does seem to drag a bit. While watching this, I was thinking and my assessment is that the build up to the film is too slow. We get a lot of action in the later part of the film, but I'm partially checked out by then so it doesn't have as much of an impact. It is interesting though, because I like the characters. I do think that it ends with a pretty solid flurry though.Next I want to cover the acting, which for the most part is actually pretty solid. Lopez is really good here. She is looking great and I like her character. She is looking out for her crew and doesn't care about the film they're supposed to me making when things take a turn. Cube is also really good. It interesting as he is a watered down version of characters we've seen him in the past, but it works for me. Voight is actually really good, which should surprise you. He makes a really good villain and I think part of that is he's naturally an asshole. The only issue I have is his horrible accent in the film. Stoltz, Hyde, Wilson and Wuhrer as well as the rest of the cast are solid and round out the film for what is needed. I do need to point out that Wuhrer is gorgeous.This brings me to the effects of the film where they're hit or miss. I think the practical effects look good. The look of the snake is fine. It does look real and it moves that way as well. The only issue I have is that the head looks awkward at times as it seems closer to the characters, but the film just kind of ignores that. The real issue here is that pretty much all of the CGI doesn't hold up. I'm sure the first time I saw it; I was all in on it. With some time and reflection, it's not very good at all. The film is shot well which is something it has going for it.Now with that said, this film is definitely a fun creature feature. I think that it has a story that isn't new, but something that is still enjoyable. It does kind of look at society and I really like how Serone plays with this crew. There is a bit of a pacing issue, which doesn't make sense with how action packed the second half of the film is. I did somewhat check out if I'm honest. I do think that the acting is good for the most part, Voight's accent is bad. The effects of the film as I said are hit or miss, with the practical being mostly good and the CGI not so much. The soundtrack of the film is fine and does fit for what is needed. I would say don't come in expecting a great film. This is definitely a film that if you want to have some drinks with friends, it really works there. It is just slightly above average for me though.Read more: https://horrorreview.webnode.com/news/anaconda",Anaconda
68,Spleen,As inept a piece of film-making as I have ever seen,2,16 February 2000,"I wouldn't have wasted my time commenting on this one if it weren't for the people (not just the ones on this site) willing to speak out in its defence. Well, sort of.  Instead of a DEFENCE, exactly, you're more likely to hear remarks like, `Of course it's bad - that's why I like it!' (okaaay ...); and, `It's bad, but if you'd had a different upbringing, you would have liked it' ... which can be truly said of every bad film ever made, so it's not saying much.I'll just concentrate on the long concluding sequence, with snake after snake ... or was it just one snake?  This is a film with deathless, invulnerable, heroes and villains, so I'm not entirely convinced that anyone or anything in it was ever killed.  But anyway: talk about one-note!  The film's `conclusion' was the dramatic equivalent of some guy on a bagpipe droning out a low G for twenty minutes and calling it a tune.  Constant screaming, constant movement, constant boredom.  Even I, I who loathe computer graphics, especially when they're as bad as this (although there were some animatronic snake effects as well, and these were passable), could not have cared less about the special effects - I was too busy marvelling at the lack of creativity, how the director never once so much as lifted a finger to make his footage suspenseful or moving or fun to watch.  Has anyone experienced sleep paralysis?  That's what the conclusion of `Anaconda' felt like.  I could probably have turned it off during the dull first half, but then sleep paralysis set in and my muscles refused to obey my desires.That'll teach me to watch something just because it's bad.Fans of Jennifer Lopez might like looking at her.  I didn't.  Don't take this the wrong way - I'm sure she's supremely gorgeous in real life, but on screen, or at least on THIS screen, she comes across as the product of the same Hollywood cloning factory that produced - you know - what's her name.",Anaconda
69,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Anaconda (1997),6,22 January 2012,"It's a stupid B-Movie with enough quality to fly by, and enough camp charm to get away with such cinematic crimes. The cast play it straight, apart from Voight. I'm pretty sure he was drunk during the shooting, coming out with an inexplicable accent and a look reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter. It's ridiculous fun, with hokey CGI and animatronics. The animatronics are great and make me miss the 90s. It's a big snake shaped tube and goes from slow robotic motions, to super fast CGI. Cube and Hyde manage some, at times, adorable dialogue. Voight's presence also unites the rest of the cast, and each character gets their own heroic captain moment. Fun filled and just plain bad. I loved it.",Anaconda
70,Kamurai25,"""That's a HUGE snake""",6,8 September 2020,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This is a huge surprise that this holds up after 20+ years, which is great because there aren't enough giant snake movies out there.This was a bit before modern technology, but that's offset by taking place on the Amazon River, far away from where technology would work anyways.This was also back when Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube thought they were actors (and I honestly prefer them as actors), and I certainly don't think that they are the any of the bad parts of this movie.Jon Voight was by far the most confusing, if not ""bad"" part of this movie. I think he was doing an impression of a Spaniard, but maybe was supposed to be having a Portuguese accent as that's what they speak in Brazil, but it was never clear if he was supposed to be FROM there or not. Even the character itself is oddly motivated, fighting to stay alive against people, but clearly has no self preservation when comes to catching the snake alive....so he can.....what...mate with it?Owen Wilson, in typically form, plays the ""let's ruin this"" role and really is a catalyst for the movie spiraling out of control.This is a ""Mr. Toad's Wild Ride"" of a movie, not good (even back then), but still lots of fun. With the bad CG and odd, but impressive practical effects, it certainly was never the impending threat of an unstoppable beast that was the problem.",Anaconda
71,Easygoer10,Hilarious and Pitiful; Simultaneously,2,10 July 2019,"This is one of those action/suspense films which is so incredibly bad, it's funny. What makes it even worse is it has a big cast. However, Jon Voight sounds almost identical to Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" (1983), only worse. Pacino was supposed to be Cuban, which is (typically) spoken very rapidly, like Domincan; both are about the fastest spoken languages. Both actor's accents are bad, but at least Pacino's is somewhat better, but still lacking. Also, he had the benefit of an excellent director and a very good plot as well. This is truly a pathetic film. I had never seen it until today (7/10/2019). Do yourself a favor and skip this pablum.",Anaconda
72,Rob_Taylor,Laugh at how bad the snake looks.,2,19 December 2002,"This has to rate as the only film where the CGI creature is more animated than the live actors. And since the CGI snake of the title is so badly animated..... you get the idea?In fact the snake is variously either obvious CGI or obvious rubber. But never believable unless you happen to be a small child watching your first monster movie.John Voight is just horrible in this one. His terrible overacting and ludicrous accent might have been a deliberate attempt to fool the audience into thinking it was someone else, and not Voight, playing the role. Surely he must be ashamed of this performance.Jonathan Hyde is the only spot of light in this movie, playing a token Englishman. Eric Stoltz spends most of the film unconscious, a state which the viewer may come to envy as the film progresses. The rest of the cast are wasted on this movie, though it was nice to see Kari Wuhrer (of Sliders fame) in a big screen role.The only good point is that you can laugh at how bad the snake looks and turn the whole thing into an enjoyable ""What idiotic thing will they do now?"" experience. At some points I wondered if the production crew had taken a felt-tip to the celluloid and drawn the snake in.One to watch if you'd had a few beers and fancy a laugh.",Anaconda
73,Matt_Layden,We should make a movie like Jaws...but with a snake....wait a minute!!!,6,5 November 2015,"Let me tell you about a little film called Anaconda. I watched this film a dozen times as a kid, I loved monster flicks. Anaconda was bad, it was utterly bad, yet I've seen it more times than I want to admit. Now we visit it again, years later, so we can laugh at how ridiculous this film is. We open with Danny Trejo, for some reason they dubbed his lines. He doesn't speak English, but the voice the use is so much higher than what we all know to be the gravel voice of Trejo. Just something that I found funny.The monster effects are laughably bad at times and worse at others. When the snake is animatronic, the obviousness of it all makes it seems like a bad ride at universal. Then we have the CGI effects, which make the snake seem like it doesn't even belong on the screen. The first attack on a human, the entire thing looks like one giant blur. The first time we see the snake in general isn't with some Jaws like reveal, it's simply the thing slithering around in the jungle before it attacks a puma. No big reveal, no slow reveal...just the damn snake out in the open. In Ebert's review of the film, which is enthusiastically gave a thumbs up, he claims Jon Voight delivers a brave and slimy performance. That I can agree with, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a great performance. It's without a doubt, memorable, but in the campy way. He glares at almost everyone on the screen, his skin is slimy like a snake and immediately untrustworthy. No one else seems to think they are in a bad movie here. Voight seems to know this from the get go. Watch this film and then watch The Room and tell me the performances from them are not almost identical. Is he doing DeNiro? Is he doing Brando? Who the hell knows. It's one wacky performance, that much is a guarantee. This was one of the early Jennifer Lopez films that probably helped launch her career. Why? I don't know, she doesn't offer anything interesting here. Ice Cube and Owen Wilson play against their usual type, I don't think we've seen either of them in a monster flick since this one, Suffice to say, Anaconda is a bad film that boarders on being highly enjoyable. Sit back, laugh and enjoy the absurdity of Anaconda. If you take this film seriously...at all, even for one second, then you will utterly hate it.",Anaconda
74,moviewizguy,Bad Movie? Certainly Not!,7,19 April 2007,"A film crew headed by anthropologist Steve Cale and director Terri Flores journey through a river to find a mysterious Indian tribe and shoot a documentary on them. They save a guy called Paul Sarone from a sinking boat. He offers to help in their search for the tribe, but he is actually a snake-hunter looking for legendary anaconda snake, which is very long.I find it very laughable that many people hated this film because it was a ""dumb"" movie, not thought-provoking, or that the movie is ludicrous having a 50 feet anaconda killing people. I don't think they see the point.Does this movie try to be the best movie ever? No, but they certainly do achieve it being one of the best thrillers ever. Do you think they want smart audiences to know that this is a smart film? No. This movie is only meant to be an entertaining popcorn film!This movie is a great thriller. You get everything you want in a thriller. You have the good acting by Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube (surprising, yes), and Jon Voight playing a sinister role. You get the good but certainly not ""dumb"" story and you get the great action scenes which visual effects are realistic!With great cinematography, a great score, and everything you want in a good thriller, Anaconda is probably one of the best. Why do people hate Anaconda? I do not have an answer. Maybe they want to be in the majority who hated it. But let me say this: if you aren't willing to watch this movie because people said it was bad, you're dumb. Watch it and you'll be proved wrong. Maybe not but give it a try.

75,fntstcplnt,Anaconda (1997),3,17 November 2019,"Directed by Luis Llosa. Starring Jon Voight, Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, Owen Wilson, Kari Wuhrer, Vincent Castellanos, Danny Trejo. (PG-13)A documentary crew searching for a long-lost indigenous tribe travels down the Amazon River, crosses paths with a giant killer snake and (even worse) a stranded snake hunter played by Voight, hammier than a Smithfield smokehouse. Whether as a model or poorly rendered in CGI, the snake looks rather silly and has even less personality than one might expect (though the legendary Frank Welker is given a voice credit!); the rest of the snake-food cast are alternately boring, stuffy, horny, stupid, etc. The whole show is Voight, muttering laughable jungle aphorisms, throwing around monkey blood, wearing expressions as if he was trying to pass himself off as a Paraguayan Don Corleone, and pausing to wink while on Death's doorstep--his performance is positively awful, but also sorta endearing, and never boring. If only the rest of the movie could be so grotesquely campy; instead, it's just standard killer animal nonsense with cardboard victims and zero suspense. At least some of the scenery is nice to look at. Followed by several sequels, including (oh, why the heck not?) a crossover movie with ""Lake Placid.""31/100",Anaconda

Jennifer Lopez is really fierce as the lead and Jon Voight is so bonkers and over the top it's just comically absurd and wonderful. The effects leave something to be desired.

78,pyrocitor,"Despite initial pretensions of maturity, a welcome bout of trashy yet enjoyable giant snake mayhem",5,10 July 2009,"Few viewers would enter a 'giant snake' monster mayhem film such as Anaconda expecting a serious, mature, award winning piece of drama, but initially it seems director Luis Llosa has somewhat missed the memo. Opening his film with an ominous contextual caption outlining the mythic significance of anacondas, then taking his time introducing his characters and the pending plot device (a documentary film about a South American native tribe), the viewer is left either pleasantly surprised and perhaps slightly alarmed (depending on one's expectations for the picture). Could this, a voice in the back of their head implores, be the singular exception to the rule - a giant animal horror thriller with the guts to take itself seriously? With Anaconda, is Llosa finally eschewing a trashy fun factor in favour of a classier, more serious vein of storytelling, unafraid to demand some semblance of intelligence from its audience? One is inclined to think so for some time, as this more serious veneer is impressively held to for an extensive period of time, as eerily creeping cameras amplify the uneasy, serpentine feel, slowly becoming increasingly tight and claustrophobic as the viewer shuffles uneasily in their seat, prepared to be genuinely scared. And then comes Jon Voight. Ostensibly cast to lend the film Oscar cred and gravitas, Voight's deranged, hilariously over the top aping of an 'Apocalypse Now' style role, complimented with mangled Spanish accent and perpetual leer derails any remaining semblances of the film taking itself seriously, and marking the turning point when it morphs into a more predictably campy and enjoyable action romp. However, even as the cliché cascades in, Llosa is at least wise enough to steal from the best, copiously plundering from Spielberg's Jaws, particularly its water level cinematography and lurking underwater shots, and, in a perfect instance of 'intended horrifying moment turned unintentionally hilarious', is even bold enough to steal Spielberg's patented 'reverse- Vertigo-zoom' upon the revelation of his creature. Of course the arrival of the snake itself would be enough to dispel notions of a credibly serious film, as the CGI looks typically cheap, complete with fluctuating size, and absurdly out of proportion mouth, making the snake more comical than frightening. If only Llosa had been brazen enough to steal Spielberg's savvy realisation than keeping the creature hidden is far more frightening than attempting to milk it for gratuitous money shots the snake might have been a more serious threat, but with the thankful avoiding of complete cinematic plagiarism, the snake at least achieves a level of 'so-bad-it's-good' memorability. It goes without saying that the film's hinted at thematic complexity only runs as deep as the age old capitalism versus ethics debate, but once things start to get crazy, Llosa is thankfully unafraid to keep things simple. Hammering conventions with gleeful aplomb rather than attempting to stumble around them, all the while gleefully winking at viewer expectations and gradually amping up the pace throughout, making the film an engaging watch, if far from a serious one. It helps the film's guilty pleasure factor to see so many big names playing along with the stupidity, and guaranteeing than, while this film is far from the high point of any of their careers, their presence does guarantee a higher performance standard than the usual for such a film. Apart from Voight's manic and tremendously enjoyable scene stealer, Jennifer Lopez, while hardly spectacular, offers an impressively measured and dignified lead performance with minimal screaming, although she is less convincing as a documentary filmmaker. Ice Cube banks on his 'street smart tough guy' persona to suitable effect, although charisma appears somewhat left behind in his rendition. Owen Wilson marks a high point, with enough trademark charm to make his slippery character truly enjoyable and underused, and Eric Stoltz is also a credibly solid performance as the team's naturalist. Of course Anaconda is miles away from any sort of cinematic masterpiece, let alone the more dignified and serious film its beginning suggests, but there remains a particular art in delivering a picture with no grander ambitions than to entertain without descending into total disarray, in which Llosa appears particularly versed. A guilty pleasure at best, perhaps, but a particularly solid and enjoyable one without question worth exploring for fans of the genre. -5.5/10",Anaconda
79,oneguyrambling,"Whether you're laughing at it or with it, at least you're laughing.",5,3 February 2012,"It's a worrying sign that the first 60 seconds of a 90 minute film feels the need to 'serious up' the tone by running a lengthy blurb that effectively says 'big snakes are big and dangerous'.Ummmmm. Duh. Now bring on the killer legless lizards! Featuring a cast that is not so much 'good' as 'recognisable' Anaconda thankfully then gets down to the business of being an enjoyably inane flick with B actors wrestling fake snakes and being thrown around by big CGI effects.The threadbare plot has a doco crew traveling the largely unexplored tributaries of the Amazon searching for a long lost tribe of primitive South Americans who legend has it are protected by giant snakes.And how.After a few hiccups in the mission they pick up supposedly 'Paraguayan' snake hunter played by Jon Voight in a hammy performance to rival that of Tim Curry in Congo. He leads the boat on a snaky ahem 'sneaky' shortcut that should save all involved time. Now the fun starts.From this point on there is little for the cast to do but look alternately scared and suspicious in between running around like white mice. The talentless J Lo looks suitably lost and confused – no surprises there – and Eric Stoltz is laid up injured for half the film while Owen Wilson hones his shaggy locked surfer boy thing that has since made him a wealthy man.Ice Cube gets the worst wardrobe and the best lines, and I dare you not to chuckle when they show introduce 'snake stomach' cam near the end of the film.While you might be laughing or gasping about ½ the time with and the other ½ in spite of the goings on, I guess one way or the other at least you're laughing.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Anaconda was released during a spate of creepy crawly based movies in the 90s, it won't blow you away but it was by no means the worst of the bunch and it spawned the usual sucky sequels.",Anaconda
80,BrandtSponseller,Excellent horror/adventure/thriller with a fantastic performance from Jon Voight,10,27 February 2005,"Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz) is leading a documentary film crew deep into the Amazon to film the infamous, rarely observed Shirishama Indian tribe. On the way, they run into a shipwrecked Paul Sarone (Jon Voight), a bizarre character who claims to be an Paraguayan priest-in-training turned snake hunter. Although oddly captivating, there's something fishy about Sarone, who claims to have first-hand knowledge of the Shirishama. Is he helping them out or leading them into danger? Although much maligned by some genre fans, Anaconda deserves accolades. While those looking for strict realism might be disappointed, Anaconda is a brilliant, genre-bending film, with just the right blend of beautiful cinematography, excellent but quirky performances, well directed and edited suspense and action scenes, and compelling monsters--both serpentine and human.The construction of the film is relatively simple--it is basically a Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)-styled horror/thriller/adventure film. Director Luis Llosa is a Roger Corman alumnus; the depth of Anaconda's characterizations and structure may seem surprising in light of its pulpy exterior.The ensemble cast is fantastic, and I especially love Jon Voight's performance, which to me is Oscar-caliber. Voight turns out to be a snake of a man, and he's just as much if not more the villain of the film. Everything about him is enigmatic, charismatic and threatening--all at the same time, even including his mannerisms and strange accent, which belies his cover story.Keeping with snakes as a theme, Llosa structured the film so that it begins with wide Amazonian vistas but gradually narrows its scopevisually/environmentally and with classic horror-styled Ten Little Indians knockoffs--becoming tight, claustrophobic, and horrifically constricting.But of course there are ""real"" snakes in the film, by way of an effective combination of animatronics, CGI and live, smaller snakes. Two animatronic snakes were made, costing millions--one 25 feet long, one 40 feet long, and each weighing at least 1000 pounds. Animatronics and CGI might not sound like something that would come across as provoking compelling thrills for an audience, but thanks to the deftness of the effects crew and the skill of the actors, the attack scenes are tense and enthralling. Unlike many modern films, Llosa keeps the action crisp, well choreographed, continuous and well lit. Of course, the performances were aided by the fact that the snakes, although animatronic, really were dangerous to the actors--a wrong move (or one electronics glitch--the mechanical beasties had at least a hundred mechanisms a piece, controlled by computers) could result in being crushed by what amounted to a medium-sized truck.If that wasn't exotic and dangerous enough, Llosa had the cast and a crew of 200 flown down to the Amazon for a five-week shoot. There are scenes in which tens of real snakes were used, many of which subsequently got lost in the set, to the dismay of some snake-fearing cast members. This aided in depicting the increasing emotional tension throughout the film that is its driving force. The Amazon shoot also provided frequently beautiful cinematographic backgrounds.Although superficially, Anaconda seems to be a thin, effects-heavy monster movie, Llosa and crew made an excellent film by sticking to the basics--telling a great story with great actors who have chemistry together, and showing them working through a series of conflicts and manipulations with often-tragic results. Don't let the naysayers put you off of this one.",Anaconda
81,TheUnknown837-1,"A slick, glistening fast-mover like its 40-foot-long star that still works for me on the same principles that it did as a kid",7,20 November 2010,"I hadn't seen ""Anaconda"" in a very long time before yesterday. If memory serves me right, at least six years had passed since I last visited this slick, fast-moving, and low-key creature feature. Despite the fact that I can be quite critical on many pictures - pictures that are vastly more intelligent and well-produced than this one - I am a sucker for creature features. Have been ever since I was a kid. Thus, ""Anaconda"" worked for me as a kid. And now, having revisited it, my response would not be sincere if I claimed it still did not work for the exact same principles that it did six years ago.""Anaconda"" is a movie not concerned about plot or story. It's primary concern is placing a half-dozen one-dimensional characters in the middle of the Amazon jungle, run across a deranged bounty hunter played by Jon Voight, and do battle with a 40-foot-long, computer graphic snake. The movie spends the minimal amount of time necessary setting up the would-be story, whipping through that quickly instead of dawdling on dialogue that, given the nature of this film, would be a destined bore, and cutting to the chase. It establishes that they are stranded, that Voight is a sicko, and that there's a man-eating snake.The movie's top-billed star is Jennifer Lopez (good performance here) but the two real stars are Jon Voight and the snake. The latter is well-realized using animatronics and some slick computer graphics. Initially, some of the snake scenes are hokey and the fact that it's just a pixel-covered 3D model painted on the screen is obvious, but they do get better as the movie goes along. After a while, the snake scenes become quite interesting, imaginative, and above all, exciting. There's not a single moment with the snake that actually scared me, but none of them made me sigh with boredom, either. The snake is well-realized and it's really cool to see it coiling around ladders as it chases after people and catch a jumping person in midair. The fact that real anacondas neither grow this big nor behave this predatory means nothing.In regards to Jon Voight, I think this is a much overlooked performance. There's a tendency in these pictures to rip-off Robert Shaw's marvelous performance in ""Jaws"" the movie that set the foundation for every creature feature since 1975. But Voight does not. He sort of reinvents the idea of a subhuman, big-game hunter. And it takes skill to take dialogue and situations that are hilariously corny on paper and make them work on camera. Voight does it. He's funny when he needs to be, he's slick elsewhere, and he's interesting just like the snake.The supporting cast includes Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, Kari Wuhler, Vincent Castellanos, and Danny Trejo, all of whom play their roles mechanically under the guidelines that this is a mechanical plot with mechanical characters. So that is not a detractor in regards to them. In particular, Ice Cube and Jonathan Hyde have very strong screen presences and keep the brief snake-free moments interesting. And I will repeat my previous statement that Jennifer Lopez is in fine form here and in more terms than just her physical beauty, which fits nicely with the beautifully-photographed backgrounds.Given the movie's reputation, I was expecting to be bored watching ""Anaconda"" again for a second time. I figured having grown up and coming to understand film and filmmaking better, I would have passed this one creature feature off despite my love for the genre. But nope, ""Anaconda"" still has a way of working on me and I must confess that I had a good time watching it again.",Anaconda
82,baumer,"Bad special effects, but not a bad horror film",6,18 August 1999,"Steven Spielberg really has had more of an affect in Hollywood than any other director except for maybe Hitchcock and Welles.  Films like Deep Blue Sea and Lake Placid and this one use techniques that I think he developed. There really is something horrifying when a camera films legs thrashing about under water as it approaches them, and then just before you think the person is going to get eaten, the camera cuts away to a shot of them on the surface, then back underwater and then the final fatal shot of the victim getting eaten or in this case suffocated and squeezed to death.  Luis Llosa does an adequate job of creating tension, but the film really is a straight to video production.  It's not a bad film, it's just not that great either. However, the cast in here really is quite good.Jennifer Lopez is a terrific actress as she was sexy and tough in Out Of Sight.  Eric Stoltz has always been a dependable B actor that lends believability to any character that he plays, take The Prophecy and Pulp Fiction.  Jon Voight is an Oscar winner and he was very good in Varsity Blues and even Ice Cube has shown us that he can act as he was great in Boyz N The Hood.  And when I watched them in this film, my question was, what were they doing here?  It feels like the talent in here should have been used for a better more ambitious project.  I would honestly like to see this cast in a more serious film because I really feel that they have much more to offer than this average B horror film.Anaconda has some decent suspence in it and most of that is because of the water shots.  The acting, as I have mentioned, is quite good too.  But there is just something not quite right with this film.  The snake really looks fake in many shots and the movie feels cheap.  I wasn't really scared but I wasn't bored either.  What you end up with is an entertaining film that is worth getting for an evening if you don't mind shelling out $3.00 for a rental.  Simply put, this is a fun movie and it is not worth the sub 5 rating that imdb comments have given it, but it is not a classic horror film by any stretch.",Anaconda

I was terribly bored through most of the movie and I could not believe how little I cared about anyone on the boat. They spend a decent amount of time introducing all of the people involved in this documentary that they are filming, yet I never felt like their personalities were fleshed out. The actions of most of the characters are moronic, and I spent more time rolling my eyes than anything else throughout the film. Even with some decent actors in the cast, I was happy any time one of them died because it meant we were closer to the end of the film.For a movie that spends so much time explaining the (completely made up) qualities of an Anaconda, it was kind of shocking how little time they spent creating a plot. There is no apparent logic to the story, and the motives of the characters never make sense. Jon Voight seems to be the one most in control, but they never help us understand what he wanted to do and why he was doing all of this to the documentary crew. Then there's the ridiculous animatronic and CGI snakes. I always like to use Jurassic Park as a mile-marker for this kind of thing, because 4 years before Anaconda was made, there was a film that combined animatronic models and CGI to make frighteningly believable monsters. And now there's this film that looks like they're using giant rubber snakes from a joke shop. In every way Anaconda is a mess of a film, and it was so bad at creating scares that it actually made me fall asleep once, and had me begging for it to end when I woke up.",Anaconda
85,vip_ebriega,Doesn't really achieve a camp classic status.,3,13 February 2008,"My Take: Tired, by-the-numbers monster movie. If you've seen films like JAWS or DELIVERANCE, the premise of ANACONDA is nothing new We've all seen this set up before, a group of people thrust out from civilization, and completely out of experience and supplies, the jungle gets pretty rough on them. To add up to the challenge, circumstance throws in a bloodthirsty creature who happens to be hungry for anything, even if its Jennifer Lopez in need of a paycheck. But while it could have been at least a decent guilty pleasure, ANACONDA is just another monster movie with the ""seen that, done that, now here's just more of it"" feeling. Still, now matter how much this film was predictable and passé, I am happy to credit one of the best things about hate film, which is actually more creepier than any snake in the film. This is Jon Voight's character called Serone. He's the bad guy who's sole purpose is too simply learn his lesson the hard way. It's no spoiler he's the bad guy, with his squint-eyed looks, you know this guy's up to no good. Sure he camps it all up, but at least he's more lively than any of the other cast members, which happen to include big names like J-Lo, Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde and Owen Wilson, who serve very little purpose but snake chow. Although it is pretty decent as a creature flick, with a few scenes of suspense (not to mention Serone), but the payoff is just a cheap, campy monster flick revamped with a bigger budget but still with B-grade quality of story and characters. The special effects don't help much either. While the animatronic Anaconda is OK, the CGI ones are just bad. Even the CGI in JUMANJI was more convincing. Despite a few occasionally seat-gripping moments, there are no real scares or suspense whatsoever. ANACONDA is not a terrible film, but it is still not a very good one, or at least a good one at that. Either I'm bored with it, or its bored with itself. Which ever, you'll still find a better show when you look up anacondas on a book. At least you'll know how to close it and end it.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",Anaconda
86,educallejero,"Ice Cube and Jennifer Lopez, what could go wrong?",3,21 February 2020,"A movie which only selling point was ""the monster"", in this case the Anaconda, made 100% out of special effects, already outdated by the time the movie was made. The only actor that kind of saved the movie was Jon Voight, but he could do only so much. At least is fresh air between the horrendous performances of the leads, two singers that can't act, shouldn't act, and just manage to show the flaws of capitalism, under which there are not only allowed to be actors in big production, but they are paid to do so.Anyways. When the Anaconda shows up, it's not bad. When Jon Voight overacts, it's not bad.But the rest of the time, it's bad. Very bad.",Anaconda
87,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"I am sorry to say this, but it's hiss-terical!",4,14 January 2009,"The standard monster formula with a huge snake. This is, however, a ""realistic"" monster (a la ""Jaws"") in that it is a real creature - an Anaconda, the largest snake in the world. Naturally, as with most films of this sort, the term ""realistic"" is taken very lightly. Sure, it is true that anacondas are large and strong and a human would have no chance of winning a fight with one. However, it is also true that anacondas are not bullet-proof and are susceptible to burns, especially if they cover over 90% of their body. So it is a little odd to see the titular creature take so much abuse from such defensive prey (a team of researchers) and still be hellbent on hunting it. There is a whole jungle out there teeming with delicious little things to hunt down. In fact, there is a scene early on where the anaconda hunts down a jaguar, a substantial meal, yet that doesn't seem to satisfy its appetite.Now, I know this is ""just a movie"" and there is some ""background information"" given on the nature of anacondas, but it sounds more like an excuse to make the viciousness of the snake seem more plausible. In fact, since the snake antics are so over done most viewers will be calmly assured that this is ""just a movie"" and the film never taps into any real fear like ""Jaws"" did, where the most outrageous chasing and action was saved for the end. Here, the snake is revealed in full about halfway through and the film loses its suspense. Which is disappointing in a monster movie where the heroes are stalked by a creature that can travel on land, water, and even get onto their boat.On the flip side, there are a few good things about the film. The special effects are dated and the all CGI snake is blatantly obvious sometimes, however the moving shots with independently moving CGI within them, a standard play illusion nowadays, was new then and geeks like me will be slightly amused by such little things! --- 4/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence/terrorPS: ***SPOILER*** Also, something that I have yet to determine whether it is hilarious or horrifying, but the puking out of Jon Voigt by the demonic title snake is a sight to behold.",Anaconda
88,Atreyu_II,Rubbish and poppycock,3,17 July 2010,"'Anaconda' is a pretty bad movie. There is nothing really interesting or worthy about it aside some of the tropical scenario (Brazil, Peru).I didn't know this movie was from 1997. I thought it was some years more recent. This movie was so much talked and commercially successful and they air this so often on TV here that I thought it was critically successful as well. I am ecstatic to find out that in reality this movie got (and still gets) many negative judgments. And very deservedly.The story is crude, a typical adventure-horror film for teenagers. None of the actors do well in their performances. No character at all was likable or interesting in the slightest way. Still, the worst of all was John Voight's character. He was so bad, nasty, hateable and annoying that he deserved to be eaten by the anaconda.I didn't think the anacondas looked very phony. Over-sized, perhaps. But they almost looked real.In conclusion, this movie is a waste of time. I largely prefer the much better 'Jurassic Park' by Steven Spielberg.",Anaconda

Kill it now!,1,9 November 2005,"Before you read my post, I'll inform you that I really haven't found a film in the thriller genre that I would consider so-good-I-wanna-see-it-again-and-buy-the-DVD! However, Anaconda was one of the worst 'thrillers' I've ever seen. Like any other film in this genre, expect many gruesome deaths and for most of the characters to be killed off for the sake of being 'entertainment' and disposable and worth a few cheap special effects. (I guess, that is comparable to the dollars I spent seeing this film at the cinema and the time I will never recover from doing so.) You can even predict who is going to die and who is going to live in most of these films - I've placed some successful bets by doing this. The characters are forgettable, and there isn't a storyline. It's basically just about people getting gobbled up by giant snakes. Oh what fun! It's too bad that they didn't kill the script first.",Anaconda

For the most part the special effects and animatronics are convincing and the cast is actually quite good. It features many recognizable names most notably J. Lo and J. Voigt. Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Eric Stoltz are also participants. I wish the lovely Kari Wuhrer had a more prominent role. She could hold her own with Ms. Lopez. There are several well done scenes such as the emergency tracheotomy performed by Paul and the regurgitation of that same character by the anaconda amongst others.

92,Movie-12,"As stupid as movies nowadays come, with phony special effects are overacted characters. *1/2 (out of four)",4,21 July 2000,"ANACONDA / (1997) *1/2 (out of four)	""Anaconda"" is a ludicrous, ridiculous, disposable horror thriller; it is the type of movie in which the concepts contain potential and inhabit an adventurous atmosphere, believably crafted set designs, and special effects that are morally effective, but the plot self-destructs in epidemically undistinguished peril. Louis Llosa's monster romp contains a very good setup, but efficiently obscures itself as it progresses.	The story begins by introducing a formidable reason for its shallow characters to seek a dramatic premise. The film stars Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube as Terri Flores and Danny Rich who, along with their crew (Jonathan Hyde, Owen Wilson, Eric Stoltz, Kari Wuhrer and Vincent Castellanos), set out on a small boat to tour the Amazon in order to film a documentary detailing an ancient Indian tribe. Along the way they encounter a creepy snake trapper (Jon Voight) who is obsessed with catching a thirty foot anaconda and forces the boat out of its course. 	The story is about as obvious as they come. We meet a variety of characters who will surely be picked off one by one by the monstrous creature. Audiences have seen this material many times before, but it still can be successful if constructed with the proper conditions. The problem is the characters are as gullible and mechanical as puppets because they blandly submit to the movie's many predictable circumstances. They spend most of their time running from the anaconda as if there is a fire between their legs. 	The performances are just as campy and recycled as the rest of the movie's lame concoctions. Jon Voight creates one of the most exaggerated and overacted characters in film history; it is incomprehensible of how poorly he acts here. Ice Cube and Jennifer Lopez form no chemistry or charisma between themselves. Supporting performers including Jonathan Hyde, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Kari Wuhrer, and Vincent Castellanos lack character definning.""Anaconda"" is as dumb as movies nowadays come. While the production begins with a mysterious, sneaky story, the phoniness of the giant snake destroys its only hope of producing fright in an audience. Throughout this movie I felt nothing for the characters, almost developing a more wholesome relationship with the reptile antagonist; it is hard to respect a movie when, in the end, after all the chaos and destruction it caused, I felt sorry for the snake's suffering.",Anaconda
93,Bogmeister,Just a Quick Slide to Snake Food,6,21 September 2005,"One thing I always wonder about after seeing a movie such as this is why is this giant snake such a problem now? Did it take reptile steroids recently? Is it a mutation or affected by alien forces? Why all of sudden now, when a documentary crew chooses to investigate a part of the Amazon jungle, does this super snake decide to show off its super-duper stalk & kill abilities? See, maybe it's just me, but I don't think real giant snakes behave this way: faster than running humans, able to catch 'em in midair as they jump to 'safety' - there are certain laws of nature & physics that cannot be just ignored. And I can't believe this clever snake was also so clever as to wait for some foreign visitors, Americans, to pay a visit before publicizing its ultra powers. But that's the outrageousness of such monster-on-the-prowl pictures and you go with the flow or you just don't go. The main thrill is watching to see which of perhaps a half-dozen stock B-pic characters make it to the end; will half of them make it? Two? Just one? The other cheap thrill is watching Voight ham it up as an evil poacher. He's picked up by the hapless crew near the beginning and very soon manipulates everything towards his goal of capturing an Anaconda alive (for the money). Voight wears an evil sneer throughout the entire film, to make sure we understand he's evil, and basically gives the snake a run for the money as to which is the more dangerous of the two. This was Lopez just before she hit diva status in perhaps her first starring role (she'd been in supporting parts before this). One other point emphasized is that such snakes like to vomit up their meals soon after swallowing, for the joy of eating it again. The FX, a combo of digital and robotics, aren't too bad. One can't deny this spawned a bevy of imitations in the direct-to-video (King Cobra) and Sci-Fi Channel markets. There's been giant cobras, rattlers, and pythons since, all traced back to this flic. Its own sequel didn't arrive until 2004, with different characters.",Anaconda
94,moviesleuth2,Fun Creature Feature,8,5 July 2009,"""Anaconda"" is one of those movies that is more fun than it has a right to be. The storyline is absurd, the acting is adequate at best, and the direction repeatedly rips off of other movies. But ""Anaconda"" is an entertaining ride if you can get past the deficiencies.In a way, ""Anaconda"" is like a slasher movie. The movies starts out with a relatively numerous cast, gets them to strut their stuff while making them appear as beautiful as possible, and then have the killer/monster pick them off one by one. However, instead of a masked knife-wielding psychopath, we have a few very big snakes.A film crew is going on location to film a documentary about the mysterious Shirishama tribe of the Amazon. Led by the director Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) and the anthropologist, Dr. Steven Cale (Eric Stolz), the trip seems to be going fine. Then they rescue a stranded man named Paul Sarone (Jon Voight), and things start to go bad...REALLY bad.In a movie like this, it's not important (nor necessarily expected) to have good performances. However, the audience has to care about whether they live or die. Save for Terri and Danny (Ice Cube), that doesn't really happen. Still, ""Anaconda"" boasts one great performance: Voight. Sarone is creepy in the true jungle adventure way. Vile, disgusting, psychotic, or any other number of malevolent adjectives could describe Sarone. The rest of the cast doesn't fare better. Lopez is pretty to look at, but there's no spark or energy in her performance. Ice Cube has plenty of attitude, but still manages to be likable. Jonathan Hyde broadens his range, albeit slightly. He's still a pompous British snob, but he's not a one-note character. Owen Wilson (an actor whom I never liked) is miscast, and Kari Wuhrer is awful.The best thing about ""Anaconda"" is the atmosphere. The jungle is gorgeous, but ominous. Luis Llosa knows how to capture it just so; you can feel the heat and humidity, but he knows this is a action/horror movie, not a National Geographic feature, so he makes it a creepy place when it needs to be. He repeatedly steals from other movies, specifically, ""Jaws,"" but the techniques still work. It also helps that for the most part, the special effects work.""Anaconda"" is a lot of fun (why it has such a notorious reputation is beyond me). ""Take her for a spin!""",Anaconda

I in fact enjoy every minute of this movie.The National Geographic crews are on the search for the Amazon people; along the way they pick up the stranger that turn out to be the crazy Anaconda Hunter. He then seizes their ship before taking everyone into the forbidden area.I remember this was such a hit when it first came out in 1997; it managed to get No. 1 spot in the US Box-Office and was a very successful movie in everyway. I still remember that every seat in the theatre was full when i went to see it in 97. But somehow after couple of years after Jennifer has become famous people then decide to trash this movie. I think the movie got a brilliant cast, actually before this movie Jennifer, Ice Cube, Owen, and Keri are all unknown actors so why people being so harsh on them? I don't understand.At that time (almost 10 years now) with this technology and CGI it is brilliant, it look so awesome with the robotic snake and how it move and how fun it was people Vs big snake. The Storyline and the script wasn't bad at all, every 5 min there is something happen so you'll get bored. It was a perfect popcorn movie. The acting wasn't great but isn't that bad, and the score is very good it go along with the movie really well add with spine chilling and trilling effect.Overall the movie is really fun to watch, don't be such a typecast and go along with what other have to say. I say this movie is a guilty pleasure movie.Reason To Watch: Watch Wannabe Actors Before They Becoming Stars.

Some of the special effects in the film are rather good and there is a great deal of beautiful scenery as well.The acting in the film is nothing spectacular, but at the same time you have to remember that these actors are acting against a big mechanical snake, or in some cases nothing at all, so I'll give 'em some props for doing a decent job.The cast in the film is surprisingly good.  Jon Voight does a fine job as the antagonist (although I didn't like him at all the first time I saw the film).  Jennifer Lopez does a good job as well, but again nothing spectacular.  Eric Stolz makes an appearance as well, although his screen time is very minimal.  The great Owen Wilson is also in the film, one of his first film credits.  While, not having a terribly important role in the film, he was a cool character, and sadly I would have like to see him make it to the end.  Kari Wuher is reason enough to watch this film.  What a gorgeous woman!  I definitely look forward to her future work.  Ice Cube is in the film as well, I don't know what it is about this guy, but I just don't like his acting, in any movie.  So he was the only cast member that I didn't really care for and sadly he's one of the few that actually survive the the entire film.All in all, if you like films about huge killer monsters/animals, then you may like this film.

Eric Stoltz was actually pretty good, however he was in a coma for most of the movie so his performance was pretty much non-existent. Jon Voight was believable as the antagonist Paul Sarone, even though he seemed very unreal at times. Jonathan Hyde was probably the best one here as the rich, uneasy Warren Westridge. He was my favorite character. Owen Wilson is actually not a complete loser in this movie for once, however this is like his 2nd movie so that sure didn't last long. Kari Wuhrer was pretty bad in this movie. Vincent Castellanos wasn't terrible either, but he was always off to the side or something. Even Danny Trejo was in a small part here but I can't really judge him since he was only in one scene and only talked in Spanish on a radio.

It is something of a Jaws rip off, only with Jon Voight with a European accent replacing Robert Shaw, Ice Cube replacing Roy Scheider and Jennifer Lopez and Eric Stoltz playing an amalgamation of the Richard Dreyfuss role. Only instead of running from a fake looking shark that we don't see much and brought to life using practical effects, they are running from a fake looking snake, brought to life using CGI that we see far too much.having settled that the film is intentionally stupid, the main question then becomes is it fun? Fortunately for Anaconda, I think it is quite a fun movie. There's not a lot of emotional investment in the characters who are all straight from the cookie cutter, but the actors seem well aware of this. Voight especially is hamming it up, chewing scene after scene. Owen Wilson and Danny Trejo drop in to be slaughtered.

Hell, I saw some of the documentary ""Making of Anaconda"" films and I was like ""Can't wait to see it."" Never heard of any of actors, at that time, well J-Lo and Ice Cube were known and of course Jon Voight. OK, now... this film is usually for movie fans who loves those films where people are chased, or eaten by (impossibly) giant animals. Take example of ""Grizzly"" (1976), or ""Jaws"" (1975), or other ""Anaconda"" films. I must say that I am one of them, not a big fan, but I enjoy it a lot. This time, or perhaps for the first time, we have a giant snake that devours everything in the way... well almost everything.Let's start: Story is typical, a group of people (you can easily call them meat sacks for snake to eat) shots a documentary about tribes in Amazon jungle, and they help out a snake hunter (Jon Voight), who was stranded in the river. However, Voight use the crew as a ""help"" to hunt down a giant snake. Actually, he took them hostage... One man, took more than five people as hostages, and no one can touch him. Why? I don't know. He doesn't have a firearm... That is one weird part... In these movies, our ""walking meat"" does not think much critically. Script is also typical for these kind of films, you don't get anything much out of it. None of these kind of movies ever tried to invest to look more complex or intelligent. Keep it in mind that this is a film for fun. . Actors: J- Lo, no talk here, I don't like her acting at all, although she give her best.Jon Voight... He steals the entire film, he was great! Calm, cold-blooded, insane snake hunter who keeps making these funny grimaces to the camera for us to laugh our butt off. He took the role and had a good fun with it. Eric Stolz. Stolz is a good actor, but here, we don't get anything from him. I am not even convinced that he is romantic relationship with Jo-Lo's character. Owen Willson plays a naive camera man. Nothing special from him in that time. And few years later the same roles will took place. Not funny, nor interesting. Ice Cube... Just there to play a standard angry dude with his usual scowl. Others... Well... no comment. Nothing else can be extracted from their performances, or characters. The snake was solid in few scenes, as a giant robot or puppet in some scenes, those were pretty realistic, but CGI, damn, that sucks. There are some of explanations for Anacondas. This movie had a chance to educate us about these giant snakes. I can't believe i wrote this. Education in Jo-Lo movie about giant snakes that hunts our human characters. The explanation for Anacondas are, probably a little bit exaggerated. Just to make audience more scared. It's just ridiculous. I say disgusting because I can't take out some of the ugly scenes from my head, but you can still enjoy it. Music stars in this film were there to attract the audience. A ""smart"" marketing move. Yeah, the 90s were a memorable time for seeing some of the greatest music stars on screen. Sit down, relax and enjoy this popcorn film.",Anaconda

Yeah, pretty much.Basically, an insane hunter (Jon Voight) drags a film crew who were trying to make a documentary on a lost South American tribe into his quest to catch the Amazon's most fearsome predator: the anaconda. As one would expected, this snake doesn't plan on getting captured and wants to eat them all alive.This movie is pretty darn good with a recognizable cast (Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jon Voight, Owen Wilson, etc.) and great effects for the anaconda.

In the film, a group of documentary film-makers traveling through the Amazon jungle picks up a mysterious man who inadvertently becomes their tour-guide on an unexpected detour. It seems the man is totally crazy and intends to capture one of the Amazon's most notorious and deadliest inhabitants: The Anaconda.Despite some bad looking CGI-snakes (not bad in a good way) and a horribly mis-matched cast (J-Lo and Eric Stolz? Really?) ""Anaconda"" is simply a good, dumb time. Without a doubt, it's an utterly ridiculous film that can be insulting to your intelligence, but thankfully it knows not to overstay its welcome and the 90 minutes it takes up makes for a harmless and amusing ride. Ice Cube plays Ice Cube as he always does, while J-Lo turns in one of her more likable roles. You'll also catch Owen Wilson in one of his earliest roles, and John Voight is a pleasure to watch as he eats up the scenery. But face it, this movie is about snakes, and the titular character is the true star here. Surely, the actors on hand have done much worse, and as far as horror/b-movies about snakes, you could pick up much worse yourself.

108,bbhlthph,Do we rate box-office appeal or movie quality?,3,7 January 2008,"(1) When released in 1997 this film soared to the top of the box office list, and overall I believe it grossed about $70 million; achievements which I am sure more than satisfied its makers.(2) 100 external reviews featured on this database and over 200 IMDb User comments are mostly extremely negative even though so many moviegoers enjoyed this film.It seems worth while attempting to explain this dichotomy. Monster flicks have been with us almost since the invention of the cine-camera. Their heyday was probably during the inter-war years when low price afternoon matinées required cinemas to screen serials that would fetch their patrons in again week after week, and led to many groups of B movies based on comic book or newspaper cartoon characters, often routinely battling against assorted monsters. At this time patrons did not expect too much - I am old enough to remember various 'monsters', mostly filmed courtesy of a perspiring actor in an inflated rubber suit, and today many younger filmgoers now happily watch these same films when they are periodically revived on late night television. But such simplistic fare soon loses its appeal, and modern monster films are better regarded as direct descendants of 'Jaws'. Since 1975 film makers have been continuously attempting to improve on Jaws - many of us would say almost completely without success. Jaws success was a direct consequence of the limitations of the animated model on which it depended. Mechanical problems are reported to have resulted in Spielberg abandoning most of the sequences where it had been planned to use it. For most of the film the monster which was so dreaded by all the cast was not to be seen. Human imagination can make the unknown even more fearful than the most dangerous of familiar creatures, and this that helped make Jaws an outstanding success. But later film makers - even after the production of Anaconda more than 20 years later - have consistently shown that they have still not learned this lesson also previously taught by the 1942 horror film Cat People. For good measure Anaconda featured two versions of the monster snakes - a traditional mechanical model and an early CGI version - both almost universally panned as being totally unbelievable. The film makers should have reflected that the Sherlock Holmes story ""The Speckled Band"" (Film 1931) provided a much more effective sense of menace even though the snake was small (a swamp adder) and was not actually encountered until right at the end of the story. An even more extreme approach is to make the threat come not from a monster but a creature with which the audience is very familiar and fully comfortable. Hitchcock did this first in his masterpiece ""The Birds"". Similarly the ultimate limit of familiarity is found in ""Lifeforce"" which threatens us by a space alien who appears to be a totally normal human being, and is even introduced completely naked so that we can see she is not hiding any concealed threats. This is a far cry from a 40 foot man-eating snake. Clearly however most filmgoers only want a story they can identify with and be carried along by. With Anaconda both visual and logical inconsistencies, which could easily have been avoided to create a technically far superior film, were of no concern to them. Even poor acting and indifferent direction also appears to have been acceptable to most of those who saw the film.How does one rate a film when this is the situation. Film makers no doubt wish to create artistically memorable works, but ultimately this is not an easy business and most Studio executives would probably be prepared to admit that their chief objective has to be to create financially successful movies. Like the starving artist in his garret creating paintings which will become priceless 50 years after he has died, a few actors and directors may strive to maintain their artistic integrity regardless of cost, but we all have to feed our families and ultimately the acid test of a film is whether it can provide bread and butter to those who create it. Consequently they will not play a scene straight, instead of purely for some artificial effect, if this might reduce the popular appeal of their final product. The critic may deplore the result but it is hard to fault a product carefully designed to have the greatest possible appeal to the largest possible audience.To me this film 'bombed' totally - the external review by ""....and you call yourself a scientist"" on this database summarises many of my reasons for this opinion in a way that I do not have space to do here. But I did not even enjoy 'Jaws' and should not have watched Anaconda. It too difficult to become involved in monster stories - the reality checks keep biting and I quickly become a passive and very uninterested onlooker although still able to assess whether they are artistically and technically well made. Whilst recognising that for many people both these films may have a very comparable appeal, for me Jaws was worth 8 stars, but Anaconda was worth no more than three. If viewed uncritically as a classic fun film (in the same way as a revival of a 1930's B movie monster film), Anaconda might rate not three but seven. Since I was not expecting to enjoy it, why did I choose to watch? Partly because I wanted to see the very under-rated actress Kari Wuhrer, and partly because I hoped many of the critical IMDb User comments might have been from viewers who were not used to watching European style productions and were being unduly critical - sadly this was not the case.",Anaconda
109,moviedude1,In a word...cheesy!,6,16 February 2009,"Documentary film crew, headed up by Jennifer Lopez, unknowingly takes on a stranger who is hunting a huge killer snake, but the question is who is the hunter and who is the hunter? This film, in my mind, was kind of like ""Jaws"" of the Amazon. The snakes in question obviously exist, and, there might be a few with such mammoth proportions, but the first time you watch this film, you know what it's all about (hence, the title). Although the special effects are way better than ""Jaws,"" the film, itself, could have used a little more work in the writing department, because I felt it played like a bad, one hundred minute soap opera/Flash Gordon type sci-fi movie.I think, overall, it was an okay movie for Lopez to debut as the star, but it sure doesn't show any promise in her range (which, over the years, proves any theories of her acting ability right). I think the one who really ""stole the show"" in this film, was Jon Voight as the crazy old man who steers the others away from what they want, even though they all know they're ending up in mortal danger.

And it takes forever before there is any action at all. And before the anaconda actually appears for the first time. Not even as a monster movie does this deliver.

111,HorrorFan1984,Anaconda,7,10 May 2020,"A film crew will have to battle a large Anaconda while shooting a documentary in the Amazon.The movie begins will a man being attacked on his boat by something unseen to the viewer, but definitely something large enough to break through the bottom of the vessel. It chases him until he kills himself realizing it's a fate better than being killed by the beast. After that, we meet Terri and a professor Stephen Cale, both taking part in filming an Amazonian documentary. They take off on a large boat with five other crew members when a man named Serone jumps on board asking to be taken to the next port since his boat was destroyed in a storm. Serone seems to know a ton about the Amazon, but we pick up a sense that he isn't as innocent as he seems.Once in the depths of the forest, Professor Cale gets seriously hurt underwater which means the group has to stop production and get him to a hospital. Serone suggests a short cut route to get to a village quicker. The crew eventually realizes an anaconda is out there waiting to attack after their boat driver is squeezed to death by the large creature and then eaten. After Serone reveals his true intentions of taking the crew out to a dangerous part of the river to catch the anaconda for money, it's a battle not only against the snake in the water but the snake on board the boat. Battle lines are drawn as everyone tries to stay alive.Anaconda is a pretty fun creature feature which has received pretty negative critique since it's release, despite making quite a lot of money at the box office. It really excels in creating characters I actually cared about for the most part. Also, it's a thrilling adventure through the Amazon. The snake is done creepily when it stalks in the water surrounding the boat, especially before it reveals itself to the crew. A couple of flaws include a very slow second half leading up to the ending. It begins to feel like the real enemy is the Serone character and not the actual Anaconda itself. The battle comes down to Terri and Danny versus him more than the snake. Also, the CGI on the snake is pretty bad watching it now. The actual puppet shots they used of the creature were way better. Nonetheless, it manages to be an effective adventure film.Anaconda soars in the acting department. Jennifer Lopez leads the way as the films heroine and she plays it very well. Lopez is so likeable, and makes her character extremely rootable throughout the movie. Ice Cube shines as the loveable Danny character. We also get heavy hitter Jon Voight as the villain which he played perfectly. Smaller supporting roles were filled wonderfully by Kari Wuhrer, Owen Wilson and Jonathan Hyde. The film also looks really good, filmed pretty much entirely in the Brazilian Amazon.I enjoyed watching this movie after not seeing it since I was a kid in the late 90's. It had a star studded cast, great location shots, and a killer snake that was an effective villain for the most part. It gets slow in the second half, but worth a watch for sure.7/10",Anaconda

115,highwaytourist,Forgettable 1950's style creature feature,5,4 April 2010,"Simply put, this is a 1950's giant monster film, in spite of being filmed in 1997. All that's missing is the radioactive fallout. Those who really like that sort of thing will enjoy this, but it's unlikely that anyone else will. The story goes like this- A ""National Geographic"" film crew travels to the Amazon River in a jungle boat to make a documentary on a long-lost tribe of natives. They then rescue a hunter from his sinking boat and take him on board, only to have him take the crew hostage and hunt for a legendary giant anaconda. I do have one major complaint, the Jon Voight character was just not believable. A psychotic former Catholic priest turned Captain Ahab wannabe? Give me a break! Other than that, the script features the usual array of stock characters and formula situations, although the leading lady (Jennifer Lopez) does more of the action scenes than the leading ladies of earlier times. There is the enormous man-eating anaconda of the title, with special effects that are OK, but nothing spectacular. Though some of the film was shot in Brazil, other parts were shot on sound stages and as a result, much of what's supposed to be the Amazon River looks as scary as the Jungle Ride at Disneyland. Still, it's not all bad. The actors perform well enough and there are a few suspenseful scenes. ""Termors"" it's not, but it'll deliver for die-hard giant monster film fans.",Anaconda

Yeah, okay. Can't say it any clearer than that.As for the cast, they're left with nothing to do, but collect a paycheck, die off one by one and hope they can forgive themselves for slumming it next to a CGI snake. Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube add some ethnic flavor to the cast if nothing else while Jon Voight is seriously out-of-place as the snake hunter.For a film that's meant to make you squirm, at best, all it accomplishes is bewilderment at why you've decided to view this less-that-stellar entry into the category of monster films. You certainly didn't tune in for the crappy story and you certainly aren't going to be scared and it's not so-bad-it's-funny either.

But no.The characters are unlikable, annoying cardboard cutouts.The acting is atrocious.There are so many stock sound effects.The choreography is laughable.The editing sucks.There are lines that were obviously re-recorded.There are lines that were obviously added in post.They didn't even bother putting blanks in the rifle.

If this movie was more like Tremors then I'd be able to forgive it.The characters make dumb decisions. Even Serone who is supposed to be this cunning, intelligent killer.The humor is unfunny.There are shots where you can very clearly tell that the portion of the snake that's wrapped around someone is very clearly not part of the snake. They tried to mask it through quick-cutting but it didn't work.You can so clearly tell that the animatronic snake is an animatronic. I guess it's an age thing but who knows?The CGI, while I'm sure was fine when it came out, is bad.The music is boring and repetitive.The cinematography feels like it tries to hard to be cool.There's no atmosphere to speak of, and I think that's exacerbated by A: this is a horror movie. And B: It takes place in the rainforestI think the movie would've been benefited from being more gruesome.There's one shot where the snake is CGI and I'll admit, it doesn't look terrible.

The music is lame and worthy of being tossed off a bridge. As far as a monster movie goes, this is no where near the guilty pleasure status of the cheese that was produced in the 30's to late 60's; the Anaconda is wretched looking, and its use in the film is totally underplayed. To anyone looking for a decent ending, keep searching, because there's none to be found.All in all, the films the Sci-Fi Channel produces and airs is worth your time and not this.

May reveal what little plot there was!The acting was super bad and totally unconvincing. The guy who played the villain was the most unconvincing out of the lot of them. Plus Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube, whose acting was simply abysmal, were terrible! There are also a few points that I would like to point out, the first one being... anacondas.After having seen this drivel, anacondas are huge boa constrictor snakes capable of suffocating their prey to death. They do prefer to swim in water since they are so big and heavy, they find it difficult to travel with ease over ground. Anacondas lie in wait for their prey and ambush it, they don't chase after it like a 4 legged reptile would, a human screaming and running is quite likely to leave a 30 meter long snake weighing over 1000 pounds waaay behind. And did you see how quickly that snake ate the bad guy? It takes them hours to swallow prey as big as him! And regurgitating him so it can eat some more humans?? Utter crap!We could go on forever in this vein so we'll go on to the next big flaw in the plot. Awful C.G.I! OK, so the snakes are computer animated. But they look awful!! The speed with which the snakes wrap their coils around the human victims is quite something. It also looked fake, and come on! Snakes have no vocal cords so they can't make those stupid screaming sounds!
Awful cliches. Guy falls in water. Underwater shots (of snake tracking him). He gets eaten. Snake gets caught in trap. It conveniently escapes. It gets its revenge: everybody ends up getting eaten. By the same snake? It gets killed. It comes back to life.I could write much more but unfortunately space does not allow me. This movie is a sad excuse for a creature feature!",Anaconda
127,thewillt08,A Pure Dissapoitment,7,28 April 2013,"There is a movie with John Voight, Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, and a giant anaconda, oh dear god. As a kid I loved watching Anaconda, but after seeing it again I must have been crazy as a kid. I think I liked the fact that a giant snake was eating people. The basic premise is that Lopez and her boyfriend I guess are leading an expedition into the Amazon and tend to make a documentary or something. They run into John Voight, a strange man with a terrible accent. Chaos soon ensues when a giant snake terrorizes the passengers and it is up to them to survive or get eaten.Let's start with the cast, the cast in this movie has very little talent. Jennifer Lopez is only in the movie because she is smoking hot. Ice Cube can't act for his life. I can't stand Owen Wilson, but that's a rant for another time. John Voight is an obvious miscast because he is supposed to be the villain and every time he opens his mouth you want to block your ears. The snake looks terrible and I guess there was two of them so the title ""Anaconda"" is a lie. The only person I can say I actually liked was the British guy. His character actually fit well in the story and he had some development as he eventually turns into a hero of some sort. One character, I don't remember his name, started out important and the movie built him up as a hero and he is sidelined for over half of the movie. He just lays in a bed in a coma like state and it annoyed me to my core. I was counting down the scenes until he came back because he was a likable and relatable character. Instead the movie decided to focus on John Voight and his stupid character and Owen Wilson and his stupidity, then his whiney girlfriend and her stupidity. This movie was frustrating above all else. The special effects in this movie are just plain embarrassing. The snake looks terrible, the makeup and prosthetics look miserable. There is a scene where the anaconda eats a black panther and the panther looked way too fake. Even the nose it made sounded fake. Obviously they wouldn't use a real panther or snake but it was poor and lazy filmmaking. This movie was not a complete fail it did have some entertaining parts, specifically the end. Despite being very predictable and knowing which characters would die when, I don't want to vilify this movie because it isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. My favorite scene is the one when they kill the first anaconda. Voight is tied up but he being the way he is turns the scene around and then there's the whole thing with the waterfall. It had the vibe and feel of a climax but it wasn't. Even though the last scene was incredibly ridiculous it was still entertaining. Watching the snake and seeing how huge it was was cool and unexpected. As a kid I loved this movie and I still don't know why. The acting was terrible but I loved Ice Cube. He was terrible but I liked that he was in the movie. For the time he was a big pop culture figure and it made sense that he was in there. I feel like I'm rambling so I'm going to wrap this up.Overall, Anaconda will be a childhood favorite but childhood opinions mean virtually nothing. I want this movie to be rebooted and made properly. There have been sequels that were OK but still unacceptable. A giant snake terrorizing people is interesting and can be exciting. However, John Vogiht's awful accent, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, either of the Wilsons, awful special effects, and poor direction is not the way to do it.

128,WorldMovie99,An entertaining movie with thrills!,8,18 July 2019,"I enjoyed the movie. The film is not disgusting and irrational. Its genre is kind of horror/suspense. So from that viewpoint it's good and fully satisfactory in its representation. I am reviewing this 2019 but in real I watch it in 1997 when it was first released. The film made me fearful when I sleep in my blanket and I remember it till today. It was as if I was very glad when Anaconda was killed in the end for that would mean ""safety"" in the world. Still today I enjoy the entire film but the fear element had disappeared now.From other viewpoint I just loved the type & mood of the storytelling, the visuals of the Amazon forest, the story line, the roles of the performers, the special effects(Anaconda). I find the tagline used in the movie as funny title.
But it will go on as ""so so"". The film will not fail to impart a thrill in you and also you will not say that you are not entertained as both of this is obvious in the film. As from the real viewpoint the snake is questionable to a large extent but still it's a movie. Go for this movie if you are a little tired of being serious and need relaxation.",Anaconda

Never mind the high brow critics who'd rather watch talking heads in arthouse flicks where nothing ever happens, this is a hugely entertaining genre movie, with so many scenes paying homage to the great classics of the genre (King Kong, Jaws, Jurassic Park etc) one could write a PhD dissertation on that aspect alone.
Forget Midnight Cowboy, this is John Voight's best role ever, right up there with Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet and Klaus Kinski in Aguirre, Wrath of God, in its portrayal of a sociopath wreaking havoc on his way to...won't tell you what, no spoilers. The special effects are totally believable and the secondary characters pretty great, especially the great Johnathan Hyde in a stock character that is super fun to watch. And even though the snakes and the river scenery function as characters themselves, the movie is carried by an extraordinary chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube. Jenny's great turn here is a brilliant precursor to what followed in her career. These two are so watchable in their roles you don't want the movie to end. But end it does, and the direction and editing acquit themselves brilliantly. Movies like this are prone to wander and meander (think Jackson's King Kong...) but Anaconda is tight and sharply edited, with hardly a scene that's excessive and not integral to the denouement and climax. Today's cinematic sophisticates look down on flicks that are just awesome entertainment, which was the primary objective of cinema before it was hijacked by arthouses and auteurs.
Hugely enjoyable, great technical aspects, great character acting, and a great satisfying yarn overall. An unsung gem of its genre.",Anaconda

Also, at the climax, a snake wouldn't look the guy and girl over, then Jon Voight, and decide to go after HIM, instead, thinking revenge first for trying to capture it. After it gets blown up, I like how the film makers have it stay above water as it keeps coming after the girl with its entire head end on fire because it looks cool. Dip yourself under, you idiot!!

The film revolves around a documentary crew searching for an ancient tribe, but their boat is hijacked by a deranged hunter is on the hunt for an anaconda. This is like a bad version of Jaws meets Fatal Attraction. That was my impression when I was watching this and I hoped that it would find a balance between the two. So did it succeed? The answer is no. The film tries way too hard to be these two different movies where they show the anaconda, but not enough. Instead were stuck with the deranged hunter played by Jon Voight. So I think that this review won't be complete if I discussed what was up with Jon Voight's accent. I don't want to know what type of drugs Jon Voight was on or his agent was on to think that this might boost his career. I don't know what accent he was going for as he sounds like he's doing a very bad Dutch, Tony Montana, and American accent. I guess that was his thought process when he tapped into that character, but good for him because he did receive a Razzie nomination. And the rest of the cast didn't look like they were invested in this movie especially Eric Stoltz. To me he was the only smart one who actually took the time to read the script and picked the character who only has screen time for thirty minutes until he's unconscious for the rest of the movie while the rest of the cast got the short end of the stick. But the acting isn't all that bad as Owen Wilson and Ice Cube manage to save the movie. Luis Llosa sure does love snakes, but maybe just a little bit too much as he gives use two paragraphs about snakes before the movie starts. The first paragraph was interesting, but the second paragraph was interesting, but it was a little too much information that's its disgusting to talk about it and I hope they didn't show it, but they did. And that's when things get a little weird for me as he felt like a kid in a candy store that he was directing a movie about a snake. And that's great that he's excited about directing a movie about a snake, but maybe he got a little too excited, as someone should've stepped in and told him to take it easy. Now I'm not the biggest fan of snakes and I don't know much about them, but I don't think that all that anaconda action is something a real anaconda would do. And they should've at least brought someone in who knows something about snakes, instead of having Luis Llosa running wild with the animatronic snake. And finally the biggest part of the movie is the tension. There is no tension or suspense until the final act of the movie. There is tension once the anaconda shows up, but that only lasts for a good couple of minutes until were stuck with Jon Voight's bad accent. But the movie isn't all that bad as the movie has a great score to it. I felt like the music department worked together on this, as they wanted a good score to a terrible film. So overall, it doesn't fit on my scale on movies where they're so bad that they're great, but it does make an entertaining monster flick if only they relaxed more and didn't try so hard to be like Jaws or Fatal Attraction.",Anaconda

(With a dash of anti-feminism..?),8,9 August 2020,"If you want to watch a movie on a blazing, hot evening and have no options (and missed this one back in the day), then this is going to entertain you. Action? Yes. Fun? Yes. Acting? Oh hell yes! Just pay attention to Jon Voight and his over-the-top performance and prepare to be amazed. On top of that, one thing to consider: the writing for J-Lo's character, her lines, are totally out there making her sound useless and fragile, helpless side-hero for at least 45 minutes. Luckily this will change slightly towards the 2nd half, but...really,
Mr Writer? Good thing that the anaconda steals the show. Finally, the overall rating here is unfair. This should be around 6.5 and is a much better monster-munch film than many others in the 00's and 10's...8/10, pure fun.",Anaconda

B Movies are not about getting every little detail right, so the snake moves at a speed which isn't ""snakely"" possible, and you know that most of the cast are going to get squished, munched and swallowed.I enjoyed this movie, simply because I accept it as a brain into neutral, kick back on the sofa, pizza dinner special and not Titus Andronicus.

This is not to mention that I'm not a big J-Lo fan, or Ice Cube...well, that was an understatement, but I'll let it go at that.You've got a film crew, a villainous hunter who basically takes them hostage so he can capture the world's largest and deadliest snake, and a very big snake that looks about as real as King Kong did back in the 1930's! There's not much suspense and very little ""scary"" moments that actually shock you. Most scenes you will already know before they happen. Why they made a sequel to this film is beyond my comprehension.So basically, I recommend this movie only if there is nothing else on TV to watch, and that's even stretching it a little, because I'm sure there's some reality show, soap opera, talk show, or cooking show on at all times!

138,jiangliqings,"It knows it's bad, but that doesn't make it a good movie.",1,14 November 2000,"** stars out of **** Anaconda, a creature feature starring Jon Voight and Jennifer Lopez, never particularly struck me as a movie that would find an audience.  And yet, it did, grossing 16 million dollars over the first weekend, before ending its run with a little over 65 million.  I saw the movie myself, and it's really not much more than a Jaws clone.  Sure, it's infinitely better than all those unwatchable ""realistic"" creature flicks in the 80's, but it's at best mediocre.Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) is a documentary filmmaker who could possibly have her big break with the help of an archaeologist (Eric Stoltz), who believes he may have found the location of a lost tribe.  With a crew that consists of cameraman Danny Rich (Ice Cube), soundmen Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson) and Denise Kalber (Kari Wuhrer), and the documentary's pompous narrator, Westridge (Jonathan Hyde), they set down the Amazon River of South America in search of the tribe.They come across a stranded man named Sarone (Jon Voight), a seemingly harmless fellow who has a sinister secret to hide.  It seems he has plans to capture an anaconda, one of the largest snakes known to man, and he's going to force the crew to help, whether they like it or not.  The danger heightens, when they must not only deal with the madman, but with a ferocious snake that seems to be hunting them down.Anaconda has a trashy script, plain and simple.  Writers Hans Bauer and Jim Cash obviously weren't thinking of writing anything thought-provoking, and they opted to crank out a thriller that features inane dialogue and contrived plot situations.The acting isn't very good, either.  Jon Voight plays his part with his tongue stuck firmly in his cheek, and the result is pretty funny (I believe the effect is intentional).  Jennifer Lopez tries hard, but she really doesn't impress.  The same goes for rapper/actor Ice Cube.  Kari Wuhrer is fairly decent, surprisingly enough (she's also quite sexy and better looking than Lopez).  Everybody else fails to make an impression, or are either just there as fodder.But the movie does have some reedeemable factors.  For one thing, the fact that director Luis Llosa and Jon Voight know that the material is bad helps a bit.  This acknowledgement keeps unintentional laughter a tad lower than what would be expected from a film of this sort.  The movie also moves at a fast clip, and I was never really bored at all.  The action scenes are competent enough to stray away from anything too laughable, though the ending does stretch plausability (the snake has more lives than a cat).The special effects are of a hit-and-miss variety.  When it is animatronic, the snake is an impressive and realistic looking sight.  As for the CGI, that is not so impressive, to the extent where closeups of the snake have a cartoonish look and feel to it.As it goes, Anaconda will probably appease afficianados of this sort of film.  It has a fast pace, gorgeous cinematography, nice eye candy, and a slightly campy tone that will thrill certain viewers.  Everybody else should steer clear or watch with low expectations.",Anaconda

And it is.  Jon Voight is as over the top as any villian in anymovie you've ever seen,  and the heros-  Jennifer Lopez and IceCube and Eric Stoltz-  form a kind of ""mod squad"" on the Amazon, with some witty banter and a little flirtation between all ofthem.Features Owen Wilson  (of ""Bottle Rocked""  and ""The Haunting"" fame)  cutting wise at every oportunity he gets.This is,  of course,  the MOST fun if you are an teenager,  butwith the right viewing props-  i.e.  a few beers,  or whatevergets you through the night-  this is a fun evening..",Anaconda

Terrible Film.,3,23 November 2000,"I actually enjoyed Anaconda the first time I saw it, but after the second viewing, I realised it was an extremely poor film, with no qualities or high-points at all.Eric Stoltz plays an anthropologist scouring the Amazon for a lost tribe of Indians. Accompanied by a documentary film crew which includes Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube and Jonathan Hyde, he heads up river and swiftly encounters trouble in the shape of Paul Sarone (Jon Voight). With his bizarre accent and extravagant facial tics, Sarone is clearly a beer or two short of the full six-pack, but before anyone can scream ""fruitcake"", he's taken over the boat and Lopez et al are fighting a 40 foot anaconda.The performances are terrible, Jennifer Lopez really put herself down here, thank god for Out of Sight, Jon Voight isn't scary at all, he is just irritating as the evil one, and Jonathan Hyde seems to be largely embarrassed to be in such a bad movie. The script is poorly written, and the direction could have been marvellous if Luis Llosa has actually put SOME effort in?Steer clear of this disastrous piece of trash.I rate Anaconda 3 out of 10.",Anaconda
141,mfnmbvp,Anaconda (1997),7,14 February 2012,"Watching 'Anaconda' now, fifteen years after it's release, it's clear to see that this was really just a spiffed up B-movie, cashing in on the success to other monster flicks of the time which were hugely popular like 'Jurassic Park' and 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' both of which I lump in along with the likes of 'Anaconda'. I have fond memories of wearing out my VHS copies of these films when I was younger, and while 'Anaconda' doesn't stand up to the likes of 'Jurassic Park' in any way, it had its fair share of influencing countless other films which would try to imitate the huge snake killing and eating everyone, none of which had a premise as good as that of 'Anaconda'.Factual errors all aside, the cast is good, and it's notable especially because of the direction they would later take in the following decade, Owen Wilson going more in the direction of comedy rather than action. Jon Voight is the perfect bad guy here, Ice Cube retains his gangster street cred, alongside Jennifer Lopez, and the absolutely beautiful Kari Wuhrer. It's nice that Eric Stoltz's pretentious character is comatose for a good portion of the film, as he's one of the least likable, although I'd say all of the characters here are pretty well written. Danny Trejo's small role in the beginning was something I had forgotten about, being that I haven't seen this in a long time. I know it's probably really only 6 material but since I hold this film in higher regard because of nostalgia, I'm going to give it a 7.ANACONDA ----7/10.",Anaconda
142,DJ_Shilo,Hidden in the Jungle,9,18 June 2020,"I have this terrible fear of snakes, and I thought to watch the new thriller ""Anaconda"" It was going to send me over the falls. Not only did I enjoy this picture, but it made me want to watch it again. It didn't disappoint, and it's a slick creature feature from director Luis Llosa. What we get is a glossy horror/action film that looks beautifully shot with some high production.It's about a documentary crew who set out to find and prove the existence of a long lost tribe, the Shirishamas, along the Amazon River. Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) is the leader of the expedition along with her cameraman, Danny (Ice Cube). They come across a man stranded on his boat, Paul Serone (Jon Voight), a snake hunter who claims to know how to find the tribe. It turns out Paul has another agenda, and he forces the group to help him with his real task - to track and catch a giant Anaconda.Anacondas are the killers of the Amazon and can grow up to 40 feet in length. The Anaconda that is in the film is called a ""Giant Anaconda."" These snakes go back as far as the European colonization of South America. These snakes grew to 164 feet in length. We can learn a lot from this film about Jungles, the Amazon and such because it's not just an intense thrill ride, it's also well written. Besides that, the one thing I liked about this picture is the look of the snake and the beautiful cinematography: the Amazon looks stunning, and the visuals of the picture shine.Before the movie starts, we get some interesting information about the Amazon before Danny Trejo opens the film with a small appearance as some poacher who is running from an anaconda on his boat. We don't know if it's the same Anaconda that appears later in the picture, but we assume so because it's vicious. The film wastes no time and begins right away. The riverboat travels up the Amazon, and it's very entertaining to sit back and enjoy. It moves on with some amusing dialogue, and we learn about some of the characters. The main attraction: the snake appears roughly at the 35-minute marker, and the intensity starts.Some will quickly see this picture as another dumb horror film with a fake snake and a cheesy story, but it's written well by three writers: Hans Bauer, Jim Cash, and Jack Epps Jr. It has a lot of fun with itself by giving you a creepy vibe with the chilling atmosphere of the surrounding jungles and the wildlife that live there. You tend to wonder when it's quiet if the snake is going to appear or not. It works of its strengths, and it's not mundane for a second. Aside from the jungle, when we see the snake, we get a lot of POV (Point of View) shots, and close-ups of the snakes head looking around. It has a very sinister-looking face to it, and it's especially chilling if you have a fear of snakes, as I do.One might say this picture worked for me because I have a fear of snakes, and it kept me on the edge of my seat because it's a movie, which is not the case at all. I liked the film most of all for the snake itself. It didn't fix my fear, but I enjoyed seeing the snake on screen. I was kind of worried that it was going to be something out of a Roger Corman picture, but I was surprised. It looks like a menacing beast with the tints of colour on its head. We get two snakes in the film, one bigger than the other. The first one is green and puts up a nasty fight against the characters, and the second snake, I believe, to be female because of the red colour, puts up a bigger fight.The second snake comes near the end when two of the characters become trapped on an oil rig, and Paul attempts to catch the snake with a regurgitating result. I enjoyed the entire movie, and it kept me thrilled until the end, and after it's all said and done, surprisingly, we get a satisfying ending. Director Luis Llosa crafts a thrilling film, and this is a creature feature that audiences will like. There are no stupid performances, and it has thrills and effects that shine, the snake catching on fire is a nice touch. There is a sequence where the snake catches its prey in midair and its shuddering as well.",Anaconda

The film deals with a group that wants to make a video film about an Indian tribe that lives in the Amazon area. But what they find there, is not an Indian tribe, but a big snake, called Anaconda. This film is a kind of horror-monster flick that does not concentrate on the story or the actors or the horror, but on the Anaconda. And that is a big mistake. It should have concentrated more on the horror ( like Jaws e.g. ). The actors are a bit annoying, and the FX are not that good. But nevertheless I liked this movie, because it was ... just good.

Well we have the Archiconocida Jennifer Lopez, in a serious and correct role, the veteran and funny Jon Voight, Owen Wilson, Eric Stoltz, the rapper Ice Cube, the British actor Jonathan Hide, Danny ¨machete¨ Trejo ..... almost nothing.All this added to a natural scenarios in the Amazon of a dreamlike beauty, accompanied by an excellent photography and sound.The direction of Luis Llosa, is not that of Oscar, okay, but he does not do anything wrong, and makes the film with ease and good rhythm.The Anaconda, well, it could have worked more, but his face and look are frightening and the truth is that such a monster is scary, because you never know where it can appear. The sequence in which we literally see how John Voight is swallowed, is one of the most successful in the film.In short, a very good film of adventure and terror, of great beauty, agile rhythm and with more than correct performances and direction, but because of its simple story many people despised and dismissed it as mediocre, despite being a blockbuster. It is clear that many of those have not seen such scares as Jurassic Shark, Killer Wasps or Tyrannosaurus Azteca, otherwise they would be silent forever.Thank you.",Anaconda
148,mbworm,Cheesy Fun,6,3 April 2008,"""Anaconda"", the big hit from 1997 that launched Jennifer Lopez to fame, also set the standard for the rebirth of the bad ""B"" creature movies. Instantly after a spew of creature features including the popular ""Lake Placid"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" followed. If you're going to endure Anaconda, you have to be in the right frame of mind. Giggly and stupid. Because ""Anaconda"" is in no way intelligent or remotely believable, but it sure is an entertaining and humorous monster romp in the swamp.Jennifer Lopez is a sassy reporter who leads a film crew into an isolated river in the Amazon where they hope to capture footage of a mysterious Native American tribe. But things turn out to be a nightmare when they come across a stranger who's boat has crashed (John Voigt in a horrible character) and is in desperate need of help. They find out he's hunting the man eating, enormous snake: Anaconda. And they do cross paths with the killer snake, again and again.It promptly proceeds to ravage their boat, terrorize them from the deep and pick them off one by one as meals for it's enormous belly. The snake effects aren't terribly bad but there are some painful up-close moments, and what's with the roaring? Do snakes roar? I can't be sure but I have to say it's highly unrealistic. The plot moves steady and you're mostly likely not going to get bored with the short story. It finishes off with a satisfying climax, but in the end it's really just a so-so movie. Some mildly decent effects and a hot Jennifer Lopez thrown in the mix. Definitely not nightmare-inducing, but it's not a total waste. For a real creature thriller turn to the later film ""Lake Placid"" or the recent nail biter ""Black Water"". If you're in for some mild tension and mindless fun, ""Anaconda"" is the monster run amok movie for you.",Anaconda

These snakes are huge and don't even mention the bull excuse they give. They twirl multiple characters around like it's nothing.

150,miroslavhradel,"Relatively entertaining, but ultimately swallowed and regurgitated by its ridiculousness",5,25 October 2020,"Anaconda provides the viewer with many great shots of the scenery of the Amazon rainforest. The special effects are pretty impressive as well, even though the giant snake around which the movie revolves is obviously represented in an exaggerated manner, both in terms of its size and its ability to eat people.The characters are ludicrously stereotypical and the performances ultimately turn out to be insufficiently convincing to hide the fact. Equally, the dialogue turns out to be uninspired throughout the film, occasionally reaching the level of comical campiness. Jon Voight is hilarious as the villain, a Paraguayan snake hunter named Paul Serone, with the ridiculous nature of his character culminating in the final sequence in which he attempts to catch one of the anacondas with a fishing net, only to end up fighting the enormous and agile snake with his bare hands. Unsurprisingly, he is eventually swallowed and regurgitated by the anaconda, seemingly passing out and then regaining his consciousness to start groaning again as his body enters the snake's mouth head first.At the end of the day, Anaconda turns out to be exactly what one expects from a horror flick that is enabled by exaggerating the features of its main monster. It is in itself a relatively watchable movie, but its flaws quickly become obvious. Even though these flaws generally offer a decent amount of entertainment, they do become mildly irritating towards the end of the film, suggesting that Anaconda would probably turn out to be a real disaster if it ran longer than merely an hour and a half.",Anaconda
151,mattbaxter72,You have never seen anything like this,9,9 January 2007,"I had been warned about this movie. Friends had told me that it was one of the worst pieces of tat ever foisted upon the movie-going public, and that its staggering ineptitude in every department made Gigli look like Citizen Kane. They were right - this is perhaps the worst studio movie I have ever seen in my life (and yes, I have seen Gigli). And you know what? It's great! This film has everything! Owen Wilson gets eaten alive by a giant snake, and we later see the snake with him inside it - with his facial features imprinted on its skin! It has Jonathan Hyde as the required Smarmy Brit (he gets eaten too, obviously). It was Kari Wuhrer doing, well, nothing very much. Best of all, Eric Stoltz gets bitten by a jungle insect after about 10 minutes, goes into a coma and disappears for the rest of the movie - only to pop back up at a vital moment to whack someone over the head, then immediately fall asleep again! We see Stoltz get a tracheotomy on screen, and yes, that is every bit as icky as it sounds.The snake itself is great in longshot, not so scary in closeup, and the numerous headshots of the thing should really have been edited out, because they look like something you could buy for a fiver at Toys R Us. But then the snake isn't the real monster here. That honour goes to Jon Voight, giving the most amazing performance of his life, maybe of anyone's life.To put this into context, this is an Oscar-winning actor, star of such classic films as Midnight Cowboy and Catch-22. This is not some local theatre amateur, this is one of the most respected actors in the world. And his performance is a long series of sneering, gurning, lip-curling, sniffing, sniggering lunacy. With a very silly accent, too. His expression as Stoltz gets bitten by that pesky insect is a thing to behold, perhaps the most bizarre facial expression I have ever seen on a human being. Later on Voight gets eaten by the snake and then regurgitated, half-digested but still alive (yeah, that's pretty icky too) and he winks at J-Lo before he keels over, dead at last. Without Voight, this movie would be mediocre at best; with him, it's almost a thing of beauty, a rare trip into a land so over-the-top that it can't even see the top, way down there. It's great fun if you're in the right mood, but even if you don't like the sound of it, you have to see it. You simply will not believe it otherwise.",Anaconda

The special f/x, intended or not, are done with computer animation and are, in that category, the worst i've seen yet. A snake that moves like a cartoon. If it was the movieproducers' intention to make a ""bad"" movie, they would have done better to use the old fashioned special f/x, with a rubber prop.2:As a movie that was, indeed, intended to be a b-movie. However, since the director Luis Llosa previously only made ""serious"" action movies like ""the Specialist"" and ""Sniper"", i have to seriously doubt it was his intension to make a ""tongue-in-cheek"" movie. If it WAS his intention, he nearly succeeded in making a fun ""bad"" movie.Personally, there were only two things in this movie i enjoyed: The voluptuous Jennifer Lopez, and the magnificently ""bad"" performance of Jon Voight, who with just the facial expressions brings a smile to your face.",Anaconda

159,cheshire551225800,A Breakthrough Film for Me in One Important Sense,7,6 April 2009,"Okay, so this is just your usual formulaic pretty young people in danger in a remote location film right? Wrong. There is one amazing difference in this film that just rocked my whole world momentarily.I watched this movie and I had this sense that something was different and I couldn't figure out what it was. There were attractive young people, there was danger, there was the slutty chick and the stoner dude, there was the evil crazy villain and there was the bad CGI monster so what was it? It took me days to figure it out, this sense that something was different here.Then I figured it out while grocery shopping a couple of days later! This was the first mainstream Hollywood Movie in which the capable heroic people who live and help each other and others survive were people of color and the stupid, evil, ineffectual, slutty, drug using people were white.I'm white and it hit me like a ton of bricks that I had never seen that dynamic before in a main stream film at that time or earlier. It bothers me that I knew something was ""off"" about the movie and it was that people of color were portrayed as the smart capable people while the whites weren't. Wow. I gained a new respect for the reality of the inherent racism in our society that day.If you think I am wrong then read a lot of the comments here. People can't figure out why the ""HERO"" is unconscious for most of the film. People jeez, Eric Stoltz' character is NOT THE HERO. ICE CUBE IS THE HERO, but we are knee-jerk assuming the hero has to be the WHITE guy right? He is unconscious but he is still the hero? No, Jennifer Lopez is the heroine and Ice cube is the hero. The hero doesn't have to be white or the boyfriend, he can be black and just a friend.",Anaconda
160,pal-o-lo,"Good movie, but the snake was too small.",6,6 November 2004,"Well, it isn't the acting, and it isn't the monster that makes this film. The acting are at best mediocre. And the monster snake is way too small.If i recall it right, it was ten meters long. This is supposed to be a monster movie, and they don't manage to make the monster bigger than the animal can become in real life! The official record for Anaconda's was 8.45m and weighed 229 kilo. But there is many who claim to have seen bigger specimens. It is widely assumed that Anacondas in rare cases can reach even 20 meter. So yes the snake in the movie, becomes kind of puny, although really cool. Yet. somehow this movie works. Strangely enough, the fact that the computer animated Anaconda never could fool anyone with eyes, helped the movie. It gave it a sort of comic book meets the movies, kind of feeling. I really liked it. You might be surprised after what I have just said, when I say I gave this movie a vote of 6. But it is something about it that is just plane good. Don't ask me what, cause I don't know. But I thoroughly enjoyed myself when I saw it. It is well worth the money to rent. But after seeing first Anaconda and then King Cobra (Which is nowhere near as good as Anaconda), I really wish they could make a real monster snake movie. Perhaps they could make a monster movie about the Cryptozoological Succuriju Gigante. A snake that according to the Indians native to the Amazon Jungle, can reach lengths of more than 40 meter's, and a weight of 5 tons. That's what I call a monster!!!",Anaconda
161,c-corleis,Cool coils!,7,16 April 2008,"Nothing, or better, almost nothing in this movie based on the real Anaconda (except the very good design of the animatronic model)... so come on, guys, you know it, this is a ""Movieconda"" that has nothing in common with the real thing. I can't believe, that some guys will take this movie for real. It was all illogical and exaggerated here. It was a ""monster-movie"", and this is exactly what it is supposed to be...When i was a school kid, 14 or 15 years old, we had a visit of a snake-specialist in our school and so the opportunity to touch the ""real thing"" and ""wear"" this beautiful animal over our shoulders for a photo... Okay, this one was a young specimen of a green Anaconda, only approx. 2 meters long... but no one of us was bitten, constricted or swallowed ;-) All of us (except the most girls, but all boys ;-) liked this wonderful snake! But in spite of this experience i love this B-picture! It remembers me to the ""good old times"", when i saw the old Jack Arnold flicks, like ""Them!"" or ""Tarantula"". I loved them as a child and i love them until today, because they are totally unrealistic and exaggerated! I loved this monsters and i love it until today! It's like the gangster-movies like ""Last Man Standing"", ""Miller's Crossing"" or ""Road to Perdition"", where they shoot with Tommy-Guns (with a 4-foot long muzzle-blast of fire) for minutes (in the reality a 50-round rum is empty in 3-4 seconds), perforating 3-foot thick brick walls to dust, or shot straight through a car engine-block... this have nothing in common with the real Tommy-Gun too, but this is a ""Movie-Tommy""... and exactly this is the reason, why i love this movies too... even if (or because) i own a real Tommy Gun and know the truth! And someone other mentioned it here before in his review: The cheap, old 1950s monster-movies are declared as great classics of it's genre today. On the new DVD-editions of such 1950s monster-movies we found specials and making-of of this movies, and in interviews almost all of the movie historians admit, that they loved this movies as a child and loved it until today. The same with ""Anaconda""... today it is declared as crap, totally crap... but someone will remember it in 20 or 30 years from now who saw it as ca child, and i am sure, it will be declared as a ""monstermovie-classic"" of the late 1990s then.Enjoy the movie, you may make your comments in the style of MST3K, but have fun...fun...fun! I give it 7 of 10 stars. For me it was a modern made journey back to my childhood and i add my lovely new ""snake girlfriend"" from this movie right beside Godzilla, Tarantula, King Kong, The Beast from 20,000 fathoms etc. to my childish ""monster-movie-heart"" that will never grew up ;-)",Anaconda
162,ChoiceCuts,Yawn.,3,16 December 2003,"This is a instantly forgeteable try at making a decent monstermovie, featuring J Lo, Ice Cube and a badly animated snake.--WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!--The plot is dumb, but the men behind it seems to ignore reality. If they knew anything about snakes than they wouldn't let that ugly, badly animated bastard regurgiate the people it has righteously swallowed, since snakes can't do that. Another large plothole is the one where the snake keeps eating people as if they were snacks. Snakes seldom eat and if they ate humans they wouldn't have to eat in weeks. Many might not be bothered about this, maybe I wouldn't either if it has had any redeeming parts but doesn't.This movie is in other words an insult to everyone who knows anything about these reptiles.

And when I heard this movie would be out, I thought ""Uh oh.""  But I watched it anyway. Please beat me.  Allow me to point out everything that went wrong with this tripe.  And these are spoilers, by the way.1)  Anacondas have never gotten any bigger than 40 feet on record.  How big was this one?2)  An anaconda is a very muscular predator.  It can kill a crocodile by SUFFOCATION NOT BONE CRUSHING.  Any snake, as a matter of fact, does not have the power to crush bones or pop veins.  They just don't.  They just suffocate their prey by compressing their lungs and windpipe.3)  Although they are very stong, it is impossible for the snake to pick up a human being, lift it up, and swallow it upright.  They can't.  It has to do with physics and biology.4)  It takes a snake a very long time to swallow its dinner.  It can take up to an hour for it to swallow a crocodile.  And that means that it would take nearly 3/4 of an hour to swallow these people.  If it felt compelled to go after them, first of all.5)  A SNAKE IS NOT A FISH.  It cannot stay under water for that long, and it does not go after the smell of blood.  A snake hunts by sight and the smell of the animal.  They made this snake out to be a shark.  And even if they did go after blood, that monkey was dead.  They go after movement.6)  A snake will vomit its food if it feels threatened.  It serves a confusion tactic for enemies.  Did this snake feel threatened?  No.  And when they do vomit, it does not fly out like that guy did.7)  Do you know how long it takes a snake to digest a meal?  When a python eats a boar, it goes without food for almost a year.  That means that that anaconda would be pretty well-fed after the first victim.8)  An anaconda does not kill for the fun of it.  They leave that to humans.9)  An anaconda will not let go of its current prey, which is still alive, and go after something dead.  They know better.10)  An anaconda can climb trees and move very quickly.  They do not fly up pipes.11)  And, lastly, an anaconda is not invincible.  I think shooting it in the head will do it in.  You will not need to torch it and take a pick-axe to its head.This was tripe, as I said before.  Do not watch this.  Just to tell you how bad it is, I think that it was pretty worthy of the MST3K bunch.",Anaconda

The special effects are on a par with the BBC's Dr Who in the 1980s.The acting is of course terrible, but terrible in a kind of entertaining way.

Anaconda is already set up to be a schlock dream and a cinema lover's nightmare, and I actually found myself really enjoying a large portion of this film. The jungle scenes are both atmospheric and lush and there are times when things are genuinely creepy. Unfortunately, a large portion of the atmosphere is destroyed once the anaconda shows up, quite early in the movie. When all you can see are the flanks of the creature, moist and sinuous, it looks great but when shown from a distance or just the head in close up, the creature looks horribly CGd, or very Puppet-like, respectively. The biggest fright I received from this was the list of somewhat respectable (or at least known) stars! Check it out! And they all seem to be having a giant snake of a time acting in what is obviously not ever intended to be a piece of art. Big snake, Horrible Voight Accent, JLo-back when she was attractive and innocent, and Luke Wilson!

The Main villains, however, are the two Anacondas, a male one and a female one. The Male is, basicaly, a grade A loser who is always trying to do more than he can, and pays for it.

179,irrelevantlife,It will take your breath away!,9,29 March 2013,"Some movies seem to be destined to be viewed as bad, even though they contain no bad elements at all, and are only loathed because of their premise; Anaconda (1997) falls into that category of movies.What we have here is the best snake horror movie/creature feature ever created with an actual budget, good actors (great actors, Jon Voight!) and an interesting plot and setting which is used very skilfully by director Luis Llosa.No doubt one of the most impressive and deadly reptiles on this planet, the giant green anaconda is the heavies and some might even argue the longest of all constrictors, and the snake has a mythical status as a ultimate predator in the Amazon, you simply can't argue that a 33 foot snake weighing more than 400 pounds isn't one of THE ultimate aquatic and terrestrial predators.The plot is very straight forward, a team of film makers and scientists travel the Amazon River to document a illusive tribe and their ways of life, on their journey they stumble across a hunter (Jon Voight) who's boat is malfunctioning, they take him in, but soon find out that he has other plans, and is on the hunt for the giant anaconda.The special effects are truly astounding for this type of movie, considering it was made in 1996. The animatronics snake is terrific, and is modelled very accurately to its real life counterpart, something that is imperative in a movie such as this; you want as much authenticity as possible. The CGI effects are very solid, and the score is catchy, yet suspenseful at the same time.People seem to forget that many revered critics at the time of release praised the movie for being well constructed and acted, so the hate for it is completely unfound.Of course we can't review this movie without mentioning the awful sequels that did made all the mistakes the first movie avoided, such as skipping out on authenticity making the snakes look like rubber bands more than actual anacondas.Overall Anaconda, is a great snake horror movie worth watching, it has all the right ingredients of suspense, horror and humour with likable and believable characters and fantastic performance from Voight who steals the show.I strongly recommend this movie.",Anaconda

His accent is a riot and all of his lines are just so ridiculous that it's great. I know people think why the hell is he in a movie of this calibre but you can tell that he's having an absolute blast playing this character. Considering that this was made in 1997 (cgi still pretty new) and on a limited budget, I think the filmmakers did a pretty good job of putting together a decent action/horror flic. It's supposed to be funny and over the top too, so it ain't a bad thing if you laugh at it. That's the sign of a good B-movie.",Anaconda
186,EugeneandSasha,A Decent Monster Flick,6,15 September 2006,"Anaconda is a typical creature/monster horror film. I actually enjoyed this movie and when I first watched it (I think I was 9 or 10) I was actually scared to some degree and even today it isn't the easiest thing for me to watch. So in my opinion Anaconda did full-fill in the way that it did manage to scare me at a young age.However Anaconda has many flaws and is nowhere near perfect. First of all I found many of the parts boring and a little cheesy. Some of the CGI was very life-like (though nowhere near movies like Jurassic Park) but in some places the digital effects where a little off-tune. In other words some of the CGI looked like it was from a good movie and some from a drastically bad film. The acting was for the majority relatively good but had a lot of room for improvement.This movie however is definitely the best you can get from a giant snake movie (Python, Boa etc. all were terrible). The anacondas did look scary and realistic half of the time but in other places they weren't fooling anybody. Overall this is a unique and decent monster flick, not perfect but not as bad as most people say it is.My Rating: 6.1/10",Anaconda

Never let it be said that Hollywood will allow realism stand in the way of the next dumb horror movie. In ANACONDA we are asked to believe a CG snake decides to stalk a boat full of assorted idiots and pick them off one-by-one. My sympathies are with the snake. I'd be pretty annoyed if a bunch of noisy, vacuous and unpleasant characters turned up uninvited and started stomping around ruining MY neighbourhood. Completely bereft of believable plot or believable characters this turkey starts off daft and gets more ridiculous by the minute. Two hours after the film has started, following a lot of shouting, hissing (and wishing the makers had given us the benefit of subtitles for Jon Voight's ridiculous accent), the only conclusion you can reach is that,after this and THE SPECIALIST, someone should really sit Director Luis Llosa down and have a loooooong talk...Technically accomplished, but basically a complete waste of time for all involved (including the viewer).",Anaconda

I gave it a 7, due to a score below 5 was awarded to it in march 2020 when i wrotte this review. IN all truth i feel this movie is a 5-6.Is a really weird film, with a really weird crossing of good and bad stuff. The plot of the movie is very basic, another creature feature movie, this time motivated by a National Geographic expedition and on the other side Paul Sarone who wants money, so far so good, then they find the titular Anaconda wich starts reying on them one by one a la Jaws.One one hand you have John Voight over the top yet really good and cautivating acting in his perfomance, with Jonathan Hyde and Erick Stoltz supporting some really good acting and giving the movie really good weight; on the other hand you have J-lo, ice Cube and Owen Wilson been just them and bad, truth be told, Ice Cube is not bad through the movie but a seriously weird decition for a main charachter.The score of this movie really stands out though, beautiful and haunting music wich really give tention to the attacks of the Snake through out the film, again, this is followed some really doubious writting for the movie. The cinematography is very unique on it´s own way altough direction is just accetable among all things.At the end of the day is a movie that you have to see and make your mind about if you like it or not, nothing terrible, some spectacular stuff, some other not so spectacular.A good point is that for its time most of the CGI stand out and keeps good to this day, there´s some really cool creature features and practical effects that really give credibility to the movie.",Anaconda

It is closest to Creature from the Black Lagoon in its structure: a trip down the Amazon of an ill-assorted group, a search for an elusive creature, or in this case, at first at least, the People of the Mist; some red shirt people; and Jon Voight playing the Nestor Paiva sort of role of the guy who's been on the river too long--and a would-be priest, no less. The virtues of the film include, most importantly, Voight's funny and outrageous performance (do Paraguayans sound like that?!). The beautiful Jennifer Lopez is eye candy. There is also the stuffy English narrator of the documentary they are making and Owen Wilson in his usual feckless character mode. And of course there is the titular character and star of the show.

Mr. John Nelson deserves all the credit for his 3-d creature animation that made this B horror movie so life like and horrifying at the same time. The story starts out with a National Geographic Group's journey on the Amazon river in search of a lost tribe. During their journey up river, they pick-up a stranded boater played by John Voight, who is in search of a giant snake to claim for his fame. When the giant snake is located, the members of the group take sides for and against capturing the snake, but Voight claims victory.

Hopefully will not have to regurgitate like the Anaconda in this movie and the snake does get a good amount of screen time.The Anaconda does look decent(real) enough (unlike the sequel). Mr Voight does a good job, J.Lo and Wuhr are great to look at, but the waterfall going upwards and the snake screaming does take a lot of imagination.

The only thing that's sad, is that you can see the snake is fake. In the 80's this could have been a great movie.

They might have lured J lo and Jon Voight this way. I say that because if asked to do a slasher flick they might have said no. Anaconda is a slasher flick, think about it the characters are established and you know what they are doing, plus we even get alittle love romance between Jennifer and Eric Stoltz...huh does this sound like a horror film..Bam the snake starts picking them off one by one.

Some unexpectedly beautiful cinematography, a pleasant pan flute score, and a strong 90s supporting cast - JLo, Ice Cube, Mr Ismay from Titanic (""Freud? Who is he?

Did anyone bother to ask how he got there?  Or how the lethal bee got into Eric Stoltz's character's diving gear?

And it is true - Jennifer Lopez cannot act - much of what she did, or at least attempted to do, was strained at best.  And since when is it written that successful rappers actually make talented and successful actors and actresses?  Ice Cube's facial expression and voice modulation did not change through most of the movie.  I suppose that it would have been more interesting if he had broken out into song just to get the storyline moving. To me, the sign of a bad movie is when you, as the viewer, start cheering for the ""bad guy"" to win.

This guy speaks with the sweetest accent. He catches fish ""river style."" He kills people with his legs WHILE TIED UP! He gets with J LO besides being about 30 years older. And, he gets eaten by and anaconda, spit up, and lives. I have no doubt Paul Sarone is still out there in the Anaconda universe waiting for A3! Terri Flores: Absoletuly my favorite one of J LO's roles. She's the world's hottest director out to film the Shirashama while making sure not to upset ""the ecological balance of the river"" by letting Sarone use his dynamite. In my opinion, only her Sarone and Ice Cube should have been left alive in the end (though it would have been a hoot trying to see the Anaconda swallow that ass).Ice Cube: I think Ice Cube is freaking sweet in this movie. He gets stabbed in the leg but keeps on trucking and makes sure to make a witty comment while killing snakes. ""Bitch""--priceless.Hole In Neck Man: ""Anaconda""'s only lowlight is that this idiot lives. I think he should have been stabbed in the neck with his own dart in that one scene and then suffocated painfully in front of all.Baby Bird: I must thank her for giving me one of the best moments in cinematic history, her death while being strangled by Sarone's legs. Brilliant! Owen Wilson: I'm so glad that hippie gets it good.Westridge: I'm so glad that dude gets killed so uselessly and painfully. He earned it.Mateo: Was he even in this movie. Oh yeah, he gets eaten after about 15 minutes, almost as useless a character as the poacher.Anaconda: He is one bad ass monster. He gets shot, and lives. He gets blown up, and lives. He gets light on fire, and lives. How does he die? Only one way. By hearing the word ""Bitch"" obviously. But of course he's back in the sequel.Overall, this movie rocks.

After all, someone enticed these big names to climb aboard.  I wish the casting agency that was so persuasive would come work for the Minnesota Vikings, as they convinced this cast to both take on completely flat roles and be made to look like horrible actors at the same time.  Oh, wait.  Maybe they already DO work for our Vikes...Almost nothing works here.  The story is silly, the dialogue is drab, the direction is clumsy, and the namesake star (the snake) is pretty pitiful. Speaking of the anaconda, the effects team must not have been paid on time - the snake looks fuzzy and painted in for a good portion of the film.  If you're a reptile fanatic or hate cold-blooded creatures, this reptilian representation will stretch your endurance for flat-out fiction.  The characters' motivations (including Mr. Snakey) begged the audience to cry aloud, ""AW, COME ON!"" on more than one occasion.  Jon Voight, having been recently nominated for an academy award for his performance in ""ALI"", must want to hide this title from his resume.  His character, Paul Sarone, is utter ridiculousness in celluloid form.  From his ludicrously phony accent to his bizarre backstory, Sarone is so far out there it almost hurts to watch.  The rest of the cast and characters aren't much of an improvement.  At best, they're the worst type of Hollywood charicatures all thrown onto a boat together.

227,lc1939,Terrible movie,1,10 July 2001,"I have to disagree with Squill's review. I'm not even sure we saw the same movie. The acting was terrible. J Lo and Ice Cube? Give me a break. Even Jon Voight who has done some good work in the past must have really needed the money to do this flick. Squill talked about the horror movies of the past. Well as you can see from my user name which contains the year I was born, I too grew up with all those grade B horror movies. I don't understand Squill's comparison of those to this movie. I thought that the puppetry used to do the snake was the only saving grace (if there has to be any) that this movie had. Those old movies had poor animation and horrible makeup. But that's all they had to work with in those days. I wouldn't make any comparison between those movies and this one on any basis let alone those that Squill pointed out. Don't take this personally Squill. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I just can't agree with your comments. Nor do you have to agree with mine. We're apparently in the same age group but with diametrically opposed views.I often wonder why half of the movies produced today were even approved by the moguls who run the studios.

Jennifer Lopez on the other hand reinforces her ability to not act.Yes this film will give you thrills but your more likely to be laughing more than hiding behind the sofa.

230,I_Shall_Return,Seemed like the only point was to further ice-cube's career,3,15 October 2006,"Good Points :there is plenty of eye-candy.You get some great shots of the rainforestMany scenes that feel like your watching a spoof (like scaryMovie) Bad Points : the fear is almost nonexistentthe snake does not move or act like a normal snake would (It also looks terribly fake, but you can't really fault that, making it real would have looked fake too)the fuel drums should have floated making them easy to recover. For that matter they should have tied it down better anywaythe villain does not really think things though (he knew the crew would resist, should have seen it coming or taken them out)the characters seem almost invincible and come back even when they should clearly have died 3 times overReasons why :It seems like many rappers are trying to jump on the bandwagon that a few lucky ones managed to and start making movies instead (must be more profitable). At first I wasn't sure if this was the case here, but then I noticed that ice-cube (rapper in question here) was getting more screen time and better things to say (being one of the only characters you could stand). It really set in though when they had his rap song start playing that I really knew. Anyway, about every film element is poor in this movie. We have bad dialog, bad scene shots (except for the rainforest ones), not really any horror element (it's more of a humor actually), and things seem convolved to advanced the plot (like how the one guy uses the oxygen tank with the wasp, the bad guy couldn't be 100% sure he would chose to go instead now could he?). Now one of the last things I want to talk about is how the characters just don't die (none to surprising ice-cube makes this list). For example, one character *cough*ice-cube*cough* gets stabbed in the leg, squeezed by the anaconda, knocked around like a rag doll by the anaconda's tail, and still manages to set the beast on fire stab it in it's head, and still have energy left to film the secret Indian tribe. But even that pales in comparison to comparison to the enemy who is actually swallowed by the anaconda and later spit up and not even dead yet!!! Finally, the voice-over dubbing is atrocious and blunt. My favorite is when they knock the bad guy in to the water ice-cube says ""*beep*! the tranquilizer came out of his back!"" Uhh...so why don't you shoot him or something idiot! Overall, pretty bad, but if you view this as a spoof and like eye-candy, you may choose to check this out.

This movie is contrary to what critics say. Although some effects are corny, such is the case when Jon Voight bathes in blood to Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube to attract the Anaconda. Continuing another bad effect is the Anaconda regurgitating poor Jon Voight. The emotional end reassures you of all the deaths seen.

That probably means that they didn't want to pay a lot of money for casting, so they gathered up a few unknowns, then added some famous actors so that when people saw that Ice Cube is in it, they would think to themselves, ""WOW!

It's horrifying, it should never have happened, you feel deep sympathy for those involved, you want to look away, you *should* look away, and yet you can't.There is too much wrong with this movie to even bother to mention.  I know, it wasn't supposed to be some great achievement of film-making...  I know it was supposed to be a B-flick.  But there is a big difference between 'good' bad movies and 'BAD' ones.  This, is an extraordinarily bad one.It seems at times that it's trying to be cheesy (which it does VERY well) and other times where it's trying to be half-serious or scary... and ends up being even more cheesy.The performances are complete corn.  Whatever John Voight was trying to do, it failed miserable.  It pained me to listen to him...  Was he trying to act?  Or, more likely, trying *not* to act??  And why bother to mention the rest of the flat cast?  There's really no point.As for the special effects...  In monster movies, it's quite necessary to suspend your belief- monsters do not exist.  However, when using something *real* as your monster, it helps to keep it somewhat grounded in reality (Jaws, anyone?).  And I don't think a cheetah could move as fast as the title creature does in this movie.Also, some consistency is needed.  Don't bother with the animatronic snake that moves at a snails pace if you make the computer generated version lightening quick.And this movie made like $80 million dollars, or something?

If only Marty McFly could drive back in time and prevent the making of this cinematic disaster.In fact Anaconda was the first time I went to the movies and enjoyed the commercials and trailers MORE than the feature.The only reason I saw this when it came out was that a friend convinced a small group of us to see it, since the original movie we went to see was sold out.

On the contrary; it sneaks a 5/10. Why? Because it's so terribly, terribly bad it's gone right through to the other side and become good again.On an altogether sadder note. Poor old John Voight. Consider his slide fromMidnight Cowboy, in all its poignancy, to this: Sharing the screen with Ice Cube, a lady who might as well act with her arse and be done with it, and anappallingly unrealistic computer-animated snake that might have been bettered by a sock-puppet.If this sounds like your sort of thing - watch Piranha, another, earlier strain of post-Jaws, post-modern silliness.

I didn't know they can scream as well. Jon Voight is as brilliant as ever but the cast dialogue coach was clearly deranged - accents are all over the place and the music is totally out of sync with the scenes.

The special effects are not even all that impressive either, and considering this is supposed to be thriller I would say that that is a huge flaw.I mean if you are looking for a film that has no thought in it then this is a good one to watch, but if you want a true thriller then check out something like Jaws.",Anaconda
