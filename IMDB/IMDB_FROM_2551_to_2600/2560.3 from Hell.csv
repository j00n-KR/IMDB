0,nogodnomasters,This is my death factory,8,3 October 2019,"This is the third in a trilogy using the same characters. Even though everyone had 20 bullets in them from the end of the last feature, they all survived. Sid Haig bowed out of this one as Captian Spaulding dies by lethal injection. The other twosome escape (eventually) and team up with their half brother Winslow (Richard Brake) and continue in the same violent antics as before. Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a bit crazier and hasn't lost her swagger as we go From ""Brick House"" to ""In-a- Gadda-da -Vita.""The film has the cult value as the previous one, but not as good as ""1,000 Corpses.""Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Nudity (Anny Rosario, Jackie S. Garcia, Christine Weatherup?, Flor de Maria Chahua?)",3 from Hell
1,kosmasp,Give them a Brake,7,12 February 2020,"A Richard Brake to be exact! While I understand that some might be missing Sid Haid in this one (fully understand that sentiment and he will not be forgotten, a great human being and actor), adding a new character into the mix, stirs things up the right way. The movie gets down (literally and no pun intended) and takes us on a road trip.A bloody road trip that is, so not for the faint of hearted or squeamish. If you can dig that, Rob Zombie has a movie for you, that will entertain you. It is not without flaws, but it has more charisma than a lot of other movies out there. And while some may have thought or said that Zombie lost his touch, one would think they might able to see this as a ""comeback"" (I'd argue that 31 was already a really good movie, just saying).Watch it if you are not on the political correct side - it doesn't mean you are bad human being. There's a difference between being entertained by a movie like this and actual being a mean person. One would hope that distinction is crystal clear ... anyway, you've been warned/instructed, don't blame the movie if it's not up your alley",3 from Hell
2,BA_Harrison,3 From Hell -- 3 out of 10.,3,29 April 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, Rob Zombie's first two outings for his murderous Firefly clan, but this third chapter is further proof that the rock star turned director has nothing new up his sleeve, and, worse still, seems to have lost all idea of what made his first couple of films so enjoyable in the first place.3 From Hell is, as expected, violent, trashy and exploitative, but it is also unfocused, badly written, poorly acted, and not in the least bit shocking, everyone trying far too hard this time around, with Zombie's wife Sheri Moon being the worst offender: putting in a grating performance that is about as subtle and nuanced as a lump-hammer to the skull, she gurns and grimaces wildly throughout, her over-the-top 'acting' (for want of a better word) making this supposedly brutal bloodbath far too comical for its own good. Even with a better script, 3 From Hell was always going to fail so long as Rob insisted in putting his wife front and centre.The plot - for what it's worth - sees the Fireflies sent to death row, having miraculously survived the shootout at the end of The Devil's Rejects. Captain Spaulding is executed by lethal injection (a shame, as he is far and away the best of Zombie's characters), but Otis (Bill Moseley) escapes, teaming up with Winslow Foxworth Coltrane (Richard Brake) to try and break Baby (Sheri Moon) out of jail. After successfully freeing Baby (don't ask how - it's dumb), the trio of killers head for Mexico (somehow avoiding capture at the border) where they are hunted by a team of luchador assassins led by Aquarius (Emilio Rivera), vengeful son of criminal Rondo (Danny Trejo), who was killed during Otis's escape.In typical Zombie style, there's lots of cussing, plenty of nudity, and an excess of spurting, bloody wounds, with an overuse of slow motion accompanied by cool rock music, some occasional trippy imagery (including a head-scratching dancing cat scene), and a consistently grimy white-trash aesthetic (there's even a three-legged dog; it doesn't get more white-trash than that!). But more importantly, there's no heart, no originality, no sense of excitement, and no character progression.As for disturbing... well, Clint Howard playing a clown is surely the stuff or nightmares, but everything else is just too contrived and cartoonish to be taken seriously.",3 from Hell

4,paul_haakonsen,"Good, but somewhat not living up to what I expected...",6,6 October 2019,"I had been awaiting ""Three from Hell"" ever since Rob Zombie announced that it was in the works. And I was more than excited to get the chance to sit down and watch this 2019 movie.While ""Three from Hell"" certainly is an entertaining movie, then it just doesn't fully have the embodiment that ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" had. There was just something profound missing from the movie. And it is not a secret that the thing missing was Sid Haig. Sure, he was there for a short glimpse, but it was such a shame that he was struggling with health issues and died, because this movie really needed his charisma and presence.So director and writer get Richard Brake to step in as Otis and Baby's half-brother. Funny, but he wasn't mentioned in the previous two movies. But sure, why not. And it might have worked out well enough, if he didn't have to fill in for Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding. Unfortunately he had to, and the Winslow Foxworth Coltrane never really managed to take a hold with me.It was nice to see Bill Moseley return to play Otis Driftwood and Sheri Moon Zombie to play Baby for a third time. I am a big fan of Bill Moseley and he really carried the movie so well. I didn't really like for the angle that Rob Zombie opted to go with the Baby character, because it was just too far out there.The movie also have some appearances by the likes of Danny Trejo, Dee Wallace, Jeff Daniel Phillips, Emilio Rivera and Clint Howard, so there is a lot of familiar faces in the movie.I will say that ""Three from Hell"" is certainly an entertaining movie for what it turned out to be, but it just really lived up to my expectations. I had expected a bit more in the likes of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" in terms of madness, mayhem and debauchery. ""Three from Hell"" is a good enough addition to the franchise, and hopefully there will be a fourth movie, because I'd love to see more of the Firefly family.My rating for ""Three from Hell"" is six out of ten stars.",3 from Hell
5,BandSAboutMovies,It just gets worse...,1,5 October 2019,"Of all the many movies that Rob Zombie has brought to the screen, his 2003 film House of 1000 Corpses and its 2005 sequel The Devil's Rejects probably have done the best with both audiences and critics. They're wildly disparate movies - the original goes from realism to a phantasmagorical journey below the titular house into the world fo Dr. Satan. And the sequel really works well - it's a grimy, gritty journey through the world of its serial killing protagonists.Since then, Zombie has made two divisive Halloween reimaginings, The Lords of Salem (a Ken Russell-influenced movie that completely misunderstood black metal on a level that you'd think a non-musician made it) and 31. He almost made two other films - Tyrannosaurus Rex and a remake of The Blob - while continuing his music career.Which brings us to 3 From Hell, a movie that I quite frankly had no interest in after the abysmal drivel that 31 assaulted my eyes with. I get it - I've seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Eaten Alive and Warlock Moon. I just haven't made it my life's mission to continually remake these films to progressively less returns.So, umm...let's start the movie.Since we last saw the Firefly family, they miraculously survived at least twenty bullet wounds each to make it to trial, where they were sentenced to life in prison, with their patriarch, Captain Spaulding (the late Sid Haig) paying the most penalty, as he's executed via lethal injection. You can tell how rough Haig was at the end, but he still brings plenty of thunder to his role, despite his short time on screen.Otis (Bill Moseley, who was Chop-Top in the aforementioned - and superior - Chainsaw 2) has escaped from jail thanks to his brother, Winslow Foxworth ""Foxy"" Coltrane (Richard Brake from Zombie's 31 and the chemist from Mandy). They set up a plan to free their sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), who is locked in a war with prison guard Greta (Dee Wallace). They kidnap Warden Virgil Dallas Harper (Jeff Daniel Phillips, who was in Zombie's Halloween and The Lords of Salem), his family and friends - including Austin Stoker - and hold them hostage so that she can finally escape. They all decide to go to Mexico.Oh yeah, they also kill a clown, Mr. Baggy Britches, before that. He shows up for no reason whatsoever. I know that Clint Howard needs work, but he also deserves better.While there, we're reminded that Otis killed Rondo (Danny Trejo), one of the bounty hunters from the last film that was incarcerated along with him. Oh yeah - and Baby is growing crazier than she was before. Or more annoying. Seriously, it's a fine line.The three makes their way to a small town in Mexico in the midst of Day of the Dead celebrations - to which I audibly sighed and not in a good way - and stay in the town's only hotel. In the midst of celebrating the holiday, Rondo's son Aquarius (Emilio Rivera, Sons of Anarchy)and his Black Satans gang shows up for revenge. The three are tipped off by a little person named Sebastian (Pancho Moler, who played the Nazi killer Sick Head in 31) and end up wiping out the gang. setting Aquarius on fire and getting back on the road.There are also some random killings I forgot to mention, but by and large, the film feels very unfocused, unplanned and yes, that word again, random. There's no sense of urgency until the final ten minutes, which place the three into a situation they may not survive. It was the only time this movie seemed to have any promise, outside of rehashing what seemed fresh nearly two decades ago, like Slim Whitman's ""It's a Sin To Lie"" replacing ""I Remember You"" from House of 1000 Corpses, seeming like faint nostalgia at best and trite at worst.Let me sum it up with music. Having ""In-A-Gada-Da-Vida"" play during the closing battle is about as cookie cutter music cue as there can be. You can pretty much say the same thing about this movie, which carbon copies Zombie's influences ad nauseam to no good end. Then again, maybe that's just a reference to Chop-Top, because he wanted that song played by KOKLA radio back in Texas.To wit: Rob Zombie seems like a good dude. He obviously adores his wife. He's an ethical vegetarian. His music was the entrance music for every independent pro wrestler ever at one point. He has good taste in bad movies. I think he'd be a fun person to discuss pop culture and film with. But man, then we'd get to the question, ""So have you seen any of my movies?"" and I abhor lying. I'd probably end up feeling bad, but not as horrible as I did suffering through this, literally a movie for an audience who must live inside the stockrooms of a Hot Topic and only come out for 80's nights and Slipknot tours, high on 4 Look and demanding they make Scream 5. In short, pretty much every single thing I have been created to destroy.I don't know if 2019 can get a worse movie. Good news, Travolta. The Fanatic isn't the worst movie now. Neither is Serenity. You can sleep safe, McConaughey. Here's hoping neither of you choose to work with Mr. and Mrs. Cummings' baby boy any time soon, though.",3 from Hell
6,Hey_Sweden,More of the same.,6,10 April 2020,"Rob Zombie again is not about to reinvent the wheel when it comes to his big franchise characters. Here, he has them survive that big shootout at the end of Devil's Rejects - some sort of Satanic intervention, no doubt - and end up on Death Row. Otis (Bill Moseley) escapes thanks to the interference of heretofore unmentioned sibling W. F. Coltrane (Richard Brake), and then succeeds in busting Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) out of prison. These three sadistic misanthropes then proceed to paint both rural America and rural Mexico RED on their path to freedom.The bottom line is that if you adore Devil's Rejects and House of 1,000 Corpses, you may find further stimulation with these new adventures for the Firefly clan. There's more torture, more degradation, and more murder. But in this case most of it is not random, as our merry antagonists mostly just strike back at those who have done them wrong - or whomever may foolishly think that they will be easy prey.Zombie slathers on the gore - both practical and digital - as well as some nudity, but it might be nice if someone else took a crack at writing the script for one of these things. His eternal insistence on dropping F-bombs into almost every other sentence gets wearying. And speaking of wearying, Sheri's Baby Firefly must have gone seriously stir crazy or something, because she's VERY annoying in this, becoming nigh on intolerable pretty quickly. Even Otis remarks, ""She's gone wacky.""Zombies' hyper-stylized brand of filmmaking is good for some amusement, in any event. As usual, his soundtrack choices are infallible, and he does keep reminding us how much of a genre fan he is by constantly sprinkling in clips from vintage movies. This viewer certainly can't take issue with the way his casts are so often full of familiar faces from horror and cult titles: sweet-faced Dee Wallace, in an unglamorous character role as a butch prison guard, and Clint Howard, as a dopey and pathetic clown, as well as Daniel Roebuck, Austin Stoker (seen much too briefly as an anchorman), Richard Riehle, Sean Whalen, Lucinda Jenney, etc. Danny Trejo is utterly wasted, reprising his role from Devil's Rejects. What I liked was seeing the great character actor Richard Edson in a featured role, as the owner of a seedy hotel. Brake acquits himself admirably, after his showcase performance in RZ's previous effort 31.The absence of the late, great Sid Haig is deeply felt. His health was failing, and he was forced to limit his participation. We just see him being interviewed before he meets his maker, and you can tell the poor guy was not well. It's too bad that this would represent his last film work.All in all, this viewer did not *regret* seeing this one, but really, he's seen all this before. The main novelty was seeing Baby, Otis, and W.F. face off against supposedly fearsome Mexican thugs dubbed The Black Satans. But even here, there's zero suspense, because we pretty much know what to expect.Six out of 10.",3 from Hell
7,zardoz-13,From Hell They Came!!!,9,28 October 2019,"One day Rob Zombie may receive his due as a filmmaker. Until then the critics will treat his work like a never-ending autopsy. Unsavory wickedness with moments of laugh out loud hilarity, ""3 from Hell"" provides us with our last look at the incredible career of Sid Haig. A legend in his own lifetime long before Zombie cast him in ""House of a 1000 Corpses"" as Captain Spaulding, Haig amassed 147 screen credits over his 80 years. Meantime, Haig has two movies which haven't been released: Eben McGurr's ""Hanukkah"" (2020) and Evan Marlowe's puppet epic ""Abruptio. Contrary to Zombie's claim on his ""3 for Hell"" audio commentary, the last movie Haig worked on was ""Hanukkah,"" reportedly the first Jewish slasher saga! Meantime, not only does ""3 from Hell"" serve as a sequel to ""The Devil's Rejects."" If none of Zombie's previous movies stunned you, then you may find ""3 from Hell"" a thoroughly engrossing opus. Gorehounds who crave the sight of simulated blood, mutilation, and tattoos galore will by captivated by this no-holds-barred masterpiece of the macabre. If you haven't seen a chiller that gave you goosebumps and/or compelled you to puke up a pile, ""3 from Hell"" should be palatable pablum with its lively cast, featuring Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, Danny Trejo, Dee Wallace, and Richard Brake. Judged on a toxicity scale, ""3 from Hell"" doesn't register, because the scale melted down under all its mayhem.",3 from Hell
8,trashgang,too long,6,17 January 2020,"If you haven't seen the other flicks concerning the villains in this one don't be bothered because you can pick in easily. That said, I have mixed feelings about this horror made by Rob zombie. Have seen done him rather good stuff maybe this one clocks in way too long.When the red stuff flows it flows but mostly action with knives or so are done off-camera, still it offers a few nicely done moments. On the other hand, Rob isn't afraid to add some nudity in his flicks as he did here. No models walking around just ordinairy female walking naked.Starts off rather good with th eimages looking like yoy are in the eighties watching some VHS. The scene at home of the warden takes too long and the mexican part is alos way too long;Sid Haig is in it, only shortly,'cause you see he's looking sick and old, sadly he passed away the same year of this flick made.So some parts do offer it here and there others are in the era of boredom. Let's hope Rob picks up another flick only a bit better.

9,westsideschl,Good for What It Was,4,29 October 2019,"Positives: Entertaining if killing, body count, and nasties not only doing it all but survive to do it again is your viewing pleasure then this well acted (for the nasty over-the-top repulsive personalities as you would ever not wish to meet) trio will be your cup of tea. Actors and writer/director are well versed in doing these B level exploitation/horror films.
Negatives: Wondering why I used almost two hours of my life to end up feeling time wasted. Lots of stereotyping of unlikely, not believable, scenarios such as shoot outs, escapes, and characters such as prison guards, cops, Mexican drug gang.",3 from Hell
10,UniqueParticle,Beyond satisfied!,10,17 September 2019,"Exactly what I was hoping for and more! Very gruesome, profanity filled, gritty, gratuitous, comedic, excellent soundtrack and has great dialogue like the other films.

I'm sure this will get mixed opinions and I will be on the side that absolutely loved 3 From Hell!!",3 from Hell
11,Tweetienator,Weakest Trip,4,5 October 2019,"I got House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects in my not too small horror collection but Three from Hell won't make it there - not even just for the purpose to complete my collection. While House of 1000 Corpses looked like a fine tribute to the genre, Three from Hell looks and tastes stale: not a total fail but an unnecessary addition to the journey of the Fireflys.",3 from Hell
12,damianphelps,Fails to Capture the Essence of the Previous Chapters,5,7 January 2021,"This is an ok movie that if it was a stand alone picture would probably rate higher. However as it is the final (I'm assuming) part of the trilogy, carries the heavy burden of maintaining the greatness the first 2 films deliver.Its cringey enough, gory yes, violent sure but not much more. For me the first 2 movies had those magic elements that very few horror movies have, that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre had. They made you uncomfortable to be in the same room with, watch through your hands or peeping over the pillow, 'what is going to happen next???',. 3 from Hell fails to meet this lofty standard.As I said take it out of the trilogy it may be a 6 or even a 7, unfortunately we can't do that.",3 from Hell
13,videorama-759-859391,3 + 4= Zombiefied.,7,5 November 2019,"""Yeah, I should of known better"", was my initial reaction, earlier in the piece, inescapable disappointment, as if I kept going back to Montezuma's and hoping for a better Mexican meal. The atrocious 31, which I saw three years to the purposeful date, that being 31s't of October, which Zombie's Halloween remake should of been released, had killed it for me. Instead of being out trick or treating, getting dressed up, all that Halloween crap, I opted to see this. But as the movie reel went on, where it earlier reached such utter depths of trashiness and repellent loathing (Is that the once beautiful Dee Wallace as a vile prison warden?) our expectations become those of disillusion, the movie actually improves radically, as to how our three merciless. reluctantly likeable trio of fugitives (save for Sid Haig, who died not only two short months ago- our young uninhibited bearded relative, void of morals, ""I like that"" is a replacement) make off, with the cops in tow. It becomes a little Near Dark, with shades of Dusk Till Dawn, and ends up very Desperado like, in it's last half hour. The movie's boldly rich poster, is a clear selling point, in attracting the patron's attention, and the movie becomes somewhat, a really engrossing and engaging watch, I myself, found it a warm surprise. Although our murderous evil trio, are not particularly ones, we want to spend time with, we really get to know em', and this is part of what greatly improved it. There's a lot of awesome, cool tongue and cheek dialogue, and there's a lot of humor too, and BLOOD, and more BLOOD. We too end up rooting for our 3 baddies, despite they're inbred, murderous, evil ilk, and appetite for nice old torture. Baby's just misunderstood. The acting is so believable, and Sherri Moon Zombie really carves out a truly evil character, to be feared and reviled. On the whole, a great night to soak up a Grindhouse flick, fully loaded and uncompromising. Well done Rod.",3 from Hell
14,jtindahouse,"Not polished, but it does the trick",8,8 October 2019,"There's been a lot of talk lately about how strange the movie 'Joker' is because it asks you to side with a villainous mass-murderer. 'Three From Hell' says you think that's crazy? How about we take the three worst human beings ever to walk the earth and ask you to side with them? And it is a really strange thing to do. The whole movie you keep thinking, I can't wait for these guys to get their comeuppance, and then as the end gets nearer and nearer you are reminded that you're on these guy's side (or at least meant to be). It's a strange feeling.It blows me away that 'House of 1000 Corpses' came out 16 years ago. I remember watching that film as a 12 year old and being really bothered by it. It wasn't even the violence so much as the bleakness. I remember I didn't know any of the cast members and all I wanted in the world was to recognise someone from another movie so that I could remind myself this wasn't real. 16 years later it's the opposite. I know these actors well now, but the violence levels are very high and can even make a seasoned horror veteran like myself feel uncomfortable at times.The problem this film faces is that in 2019 there are so many ultra-violent movies out there that it is hard to separate yourself. What would have been shocking 16 years ago no longer is. I personally did get what I wanted out of this movie though. It was a simple plot, and gave us a chance to revisit these characters one last time (maybe, or maybe not). The movie isn't as polished as some other Rob Zombie movies and feels a bit rushed at times. For example a couple of times characters fluff a line and yet those takes still made the final cut. Still though, I had a good time with 'Three From Hell' and I think most Zombie lovers will be satisfied enough with this third installment.",3 from Hell
15,jadavix,A return to form,7,17 June 2020,"""3 from Hell"" is kind of a return to form for Rob Zombie after the misstep that was ""31"". It gets off to a shaky start, with an approach halfway between found footage and an old newsreel, but when it gets going, it doesn't let up, and culminates in some great sequences.You already know what it's about: the gang gets out of jail and hides out in Mexico where they get in trouble with cartels. Unfortunately the late Sid Haig isn't in it much, but the movie is watchable through the shaky start due to Bill Moseley's performance.The story isn't much, but allows the action in the climactic scenes to take centre stage.I say check it out.",3 from Hell
16,Stevieboy666,Perhaps they should have stayed in Hell. Disappointing,5,22 February 2020,"Somehow, incredibly the Devil's Rejects survived the ending of the previous movie in this ""Firefly"" film series from Rob Zombie. Tragically horror legend Sid Haig died, forcing some major rewriting of the script, and the beginning of 3 From Hell does serve as a goodbye to this extremely popular cult actor.
Move on 15 years and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) and Otis (Bill Moseley) escape (both very far fetched and unbelievable) with the help of a third unsavoury character called Winslow Foxworth Coltrane and embark on the usual violence and murder, eventually heading to Mexico.
Sadly I don't think it was worth the 15 year wait. I found it way too far fetched, our 3 From Hell are virtually indestructible and I found myself willing them to get killed off. The film is too long and slow in places, is very heavy on the dialogue and overdoes the swearing. Moseley seemed lazy in his role and Moon Zombie too over the top in hers. I do like Rob Zombie's work and here we do get his trademark violence, nudity, cool music and desert landscapes but I felt disappointed with this movie.A long wait for a film that in my opinion does not need to exist, he should've ended with The Devil's Rejects.",3 from Hell
17,kevin_robbins,This storyline felt like Zombie ran out of ideas for another movie and just wanted to make another Firefly picture,5,16 June 2021,"3 From Hell (2019) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime and continues the Firefly family story. Somehow the Firefly family survives the shootout at the end of Devil's Rejects and stands trial for over 30 killings. They portray themselves as victims of the justice system and plan their escape from prison. If they're able to escape, they will be hunted down like no one before them... This movie is directed by Rob Zombie (House of 1,000 Corpses) and stars Sheri Moon Zombie (Lords of Salem), Bill Moseley (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), Jeff Daniel (Westworld) and Richard Brake (31). This storyline felt like Zombie ran out of ideas for another movie and just wanted to make another Firefly picture...every plot and subplot is terrible. The film keeps its great cinematography, grit, kill scenes, gore and intensity of his precious Firefly films, but the story itself you care nothing about. Even the action is so much more spread out it makes it kind of blah. The casting and dialogue remained superb, and I did like the ending, and there's a good influx of nudity; but overall, this is very average and his worst work I've seen to date. I'd score this a 5/10.",3 from Hell
18,kwenchow,Another worst horror film! Too many talking and boring overuse scene! The killing scene also too slow and messy! Not recommended!,1,21 December 2019,"This film start with one woman and two men driving on the road, and a video footage introduce the so called ""The Devil's Rejects""(Baby, Otis and Winslow) scene! As turnout, this film is about The Devil's Rejects escape from prison, killing a bunch of innocent person, and they eventually seek revenge by Rondo's son, because they kill his father! Entire film full of super boring overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the super annoying song playing at the background scene, overuse of the super slow motion scene and overuse of the watching news and movie on TV scene! Baby keep acting like a crazy woman in the film also felt super annoying! Even the disgusting nudity scene can't save this movie! The killing scene in the film quite bloody, but it had slow motion in it, make it too bored to watch! The shooting with gun, stabbing with knife and shooting with arrow scene also quite simply and messy! At the end, Rondo's son found The Devil's Rejects, The Devil's Rejects get caught!

22,I_Ailurophile,One word review: Unnecessary,1,10 October 2020,"It's been years since I've watched 'House of 1000 corpses' or 'The devil's rejects,' both of which came to my attention specifically because I've enjoyed the man's music. I haven't seen any of his other movies, and I honestly don't remember anything of this one's predecessors aside from the ending to the latter. Yet given the opportunity to watch this, I felt that I had to--for the sake of completion, and in honor of Sid Haig.Rob Zombie loves horror. There's no mistaking that: his love for the genre is written all over everything he has done, in music and in cinema, throughout his entire career. Cult classics and genre staples, sure, but B-movies most of all--the worse, the better. All his work is nothing if not an effort to put his own stamp on what horror is, was, or could be.Maybe it's time for him to stop.The dialogue is abhorrent, sounding a whole lot like what a couple 13-year old social outcasts might find transgressive, edgy, and therefore brilliant as they try to make their own home video horror movies. The rest of the screenplay is what might happen if you flicked a wet paintbrush at a wall, then used a marker to ""connect the dots"" without any particular rhyme or reason: the dots are connected, but to what end?I've seen some reviews suggest that Mr. Zombie may be best suited directing other people's scripts, but I'm not sure that's the case. Being behind a camera doesn't inherently mean someone knows how to use it--orientating a shot, sequencing multiple shots or scenes, finding the perfect lighting and angles... One doesn't need to be a filmmaker to understand that there's a method to making art, whatever form that method or that art may take. Does Rob understand that?Moments of otherwise levity can be used in horror to offer contrast to the terror being visited on characters. In the hands of an expert craftsman, levity can be used to enhance that terror: A clown's performance, a party, or a person's carefree dancing can add tension to a scene in which other people are being victimized. On the other hand, they can also disrupt the narrative at best, or add pointless camp to a scene at worst. Unfortunately, Zombie's insertion of levity is the type that detracts from a movie rather than adding to it.The violence, cruelty, and nudity of the film is as pointless as the protagonists' trek, and yet without them, all that would be left would be the juvenile dialogue. The use of Iron Butterfly's timeless ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" late in the movie recalls its addition to a scene in Michael Mann's 'Manhunter,' but it's employed here to just as kitschy an effect. The climactic showdown is a substantial letdown--you know there aren't truly any stakes for the characters, so there's no reason for the viewer to care about this fight.The violence herein is so frequent that it becomes commonplace and pedestrian instead of shocking. Apparently violence for its own sake is sufficient escapism for some horror fans; good for them. I need something a bit more fulfilling. I found '3 from Hell' boring and unexciting, incapable of actually eliciting a reaction.What I take away from watching '3 from Hell,' in the very least, is that I don't need to bother watching any other Rob Zombie film from here on out. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but that certainly doesn't mean it has my favor. The best thing I can say about it is that if the entirety of the screenplay were scrapped, and only a scant outline of the threadbare plot remained, then I could imagine how other writers and filmmakers might possibly make this into a decent 90-minute feature.",3 from Hell
23,dworldeater,"Decent, but the least of the 3 films in the series",6,23 November 2019,"Rob Zombie decides after a long hiatus to resurrect The Firefly Family for this unexpected sequel. Due to health issues, Sid Haig's character is killed off and replaced by Richard Brake as Foxy, Otis's(Bill Mosley) psychotic hillbilly half brother joins this band of derelicts on their run from the law. This film has less in common with The Sawyer Family from Texas Chainsaw 1 and 2 and more in common with The Manson Family, which makes the film a lot different from the other movies in the series. In addition to a different approach to this franchise and these characters, I did not think it was quite as good, or worked as well. Even so, I did find this to be interesting and also somewhat enjoyable. 3 From Hell is still very gritty and is has that earthy 70's vibe and style Rob Zombie goes for, but this is not exactly a horror movie(or less of one)which will surely dissapoint some fans of the franchise. It is still dark and disturbing and an odd movie, that in my opinion is still worth watching.",3 from Hell
24,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Follow-up to a Great Film,7,24 October 2019,"This was a film that was a mixed bag for me. I was intrigued when I heard they were making this, but I really enjoyed the movie prior to this, The Devil's Rejects, which had an amazing ending. I wasn't sure how they were going to pick this one up and what we would get. I also heard a mixed bag from podcasters I enjoy listening to so that also influenced by interest. There really isn't a synopsis on the Internet Movie Database, so I'll get right into a recap.We learn that the Devil's Rejects survived what happened at the roadblock. Each of them took 20 shots and after a long recovery, survived. We see there's a number of people in the public think they're wrongly accused. They are protesting for them to be released. This is actually an interesting commentary that is relevant, in that we see a lot of protesting happening and it actually feels like Zombie mocking that, since we know they're guilty. With that said, Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley) and Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) are all convicted. It looks like Baby and Otis get life sentences and Captain Spaulding gets the death penalty as well actually executed.There's a documentary being done about these three and it actually makes the warden Virgil Harper (Jeff Daniel Phillips) look bad. He comes off a bit arrogant and that he's in control. That's not the case when Otis is freed during a work detail by his half brother, Winslow Foxworth Coltrane (Richard Brake). During this breakout, Rondo (Danny Trejo) is murdered.The two of them go on the run and try to figure out a way to free Baby. This takes them to Virgil's house where they have to take Gerard James (Kevin Jackson), Virgil's wife Judy (Tracey Leigh) and Heather Starship Galen (Sylvia Jeffries) hostage. If it works, they don't know what their next plan is, but they're sure to cause mayhem on the way.Now I decided to go a little lighter on the recap here as I didn't want to spoil too much. I had to go a little bit in recap, because due to Haig's health, they had to find a way to limit his time in the film. It really is a shame though, because he is so good. I actually think it would have been more plausible to have him die in the shoot out though, but Captain Spaulding does have a good line when being interviewed here.It could be considered a cheat by adding Winslow to this in order to make sure we have the trio. I can overlook it, because writer/director Rob Zombie did write these characters to be quite white trash so it is most definitely possible to have another half sibling out there. I will say though that I'm not a fan of his nickname, the Midnight Wolfman, but thankfully Brake is an amazing actor.Something I really want to address, which is one of my issues with Zombie's films. I don't mind the grittiness of his characters and having them white trash like we see here with the trio. The problem though is that he makes everyone that way and it's not as believable. Now I will admit this one is better in that sense than what we got with 31. There's just an excessive amount of swearing from some people that I wouldn't necessarily buy it from.The last thing to cover before moving on is that this movie takes a wild turn for sure. The first part of it really is trying to figure out a way to get Baby out of prison. I actually don't mind the plan they come up with since this film takes place in the 80's. It just gets really wild from that latter half for sure.To the pacing of this one, I think it is fine for the most part. The biggest issue I have with it is that it runs almost 2 hours and I think that's too much. I feel that Zombie put in some cameos that really don't need to be there and we get a lot of just filler at times. It could be trimmed by 10 to 20 minutes and it would have run as a tighter film. It still builds tension to see the depravity of these characters, just not on the level of The Devil's Rejects. The ending is fine, but it is no where near its predecessor.Shifting to the acting, I think that it's actually pretty solid. I heard from podcasts that this is probably Sheri Moon Zombies best performance and I might have to agree. Otis and Winslow notice there's something off about her. It does seem like she is broken and just way more insane from her time behind bars. There's even an interesting story she tells Virgil about a cat that is stuck that she's trying to help and we see her watching this weird screen under bed. It is kind of a weird scene, but it does seem to show she's off. Moseley and Brake are both great and play off each other well. Haig was solid in his cameo. I thought Phillips was fine as was seeing Emilio Rivera as Aquarius. Pancho Moler, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Wade Willliams and Sean Whalen also have good cameos as well as rounding out the film for what was needed with the rest.As to the effects of this one, for the most part they're good. This one is gritty and brutal. We get some really good practical effects, especially a good amount of the blood. There's a slitting of a throat that stood out for sure. An issue I did have is that close to the climax, they have some bullet wounds that are done with CGI. I wasn't a fan there and we also get a slow-motion look at an arrow that started to make this feel like an action film. I will say though that Zombie again nailed it on the filter used in the beginning of this to make it feel like the 1970's. This one moves into the 80's since they were all held in prison. I thought that still worked.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of this one. There is a moment late in the film that it features a rock song that I can seem to figure out the artist and song title, but it has such a creepy sound to it. That definitely works. I know early on we had a song that didn't necessarily fit the tone of the film for me. Overall though I would say that the soundtrack is still solid and it never really took me aside from that one time.Now with said, I've heard a lot of people being quite decisive about this film coming in and that actually made me excited to see it to determine for myself. If I'm honest, Zombie's films are definitely hit or miss for me, especially the first time around. I think that this one has some interesting social commentary that is relevant today and has an extremely bleak outlook on life. I like that the continuity for the most part is intact, except knowing that a character really couldn't be there to kill him off at the more logical spot. There's a bit of a cheat after that, but I actually really like the actor even though the character not so much. I do think that the film runs a bit long and the ending isn't anywhere near as iconic for the shoes this one tries to fill as a trilogy. The acting is good though across the board and the practical effects too. I did have some issues with the CGI gunshots though. The soundtrack has some points I really like and some that I don't really care for, but for the most part it fits. I still think this is probably my least favorite of that trilogy and probably just above average for me. I would still recommend it if you like this group of Zombie films or him in general.",3 from Hell
25,RatedVforVinny,"Two steps down, one step sideways.",8,17 January 2020,"The long awaited sequel to the huge, runaway success of 'The Devils Rejects', which I have previously scored a perfect 10. It was a terrible shame that Sid Haig (R.I.P), was not up to the role, though he does appear as a cameo and a makeshift script was always going to be a tough ask to execute. Despite the mega poor response, in some of reviews, I think Rob Zombie made a very credible and authentic movie. The characters have been nicely developed 15 years on. A very older looking Baby, has gone completely nuts, Richard Brake (newbie 'Reject)', injects some fresh energy and Bill Moseley, is just the very best (as he always is). It's ironic that his character Otis Driftwood, is now like the most experienced 'Reject' and describes himself as the ""Wise old owl, of the bunch"". Robe Zombie himself specializes in graphic violence on screen and thankfully delivers here in heaps. With more time and the right preparation, I'd like to see where he takes the characters next?",3 from Hell
26,vengeance20,Nothing New,6,27 October 2019,"So after 14 years since The Devil's Rejects back in 2005, we get the long awaited sequel in the Hillbilly Trilogy, 3 From Hell.Now, while I don't complain like most people on here about originality, cliches, predictability etc, I did find this film to be somewhat unnecessary. I love gore, blood, violence in horrors generally let alone the slasher genre. But there HAS to be more than what is presented on paper...This film follows the 3 Hillbillies who escape prison (after being apprehended in the last film) & basically go on a rampage. Nothing too it really. Sid Haig, who passed away got written out earlier in the film so another actor took the place & completed the trio.The issue with the film is that its too much the same as the previous films, minus the story-line. I mean, the escape from prison plot was good, but just like the characters themselves, the audience is left lost with where the film is going to go next. The film ends pretty much not too dissimilar to how the previous 2 ended. So even still the film itself doesn't offer anything new or remotely anything memorable aside from the usual. I mean I liked the film for the gore, but story line wise... it could've been better.Overall... Nothing New. 6/10",3 from Hell
27,arungeorge13,"It doesn't work, it just doesn't! The antithesis to The Devil's Rejects. [+44%]",4,19 September 2020,"3 from Hell basically revokes the brilliance of The Devil's Rejects in every possible way. First of all, it's meh to think that the sadistic trio from the aforementioned cult classic had to be ""resurrected"" for whatever transpires in 3 from Hell. There's zero explanation as to how they survived the shootout at the end of The Devil's Rejects. Secondly, the greatest character in the series - Captain Spaulding (played by the legendary Sid Haig) - is given hardly 5 minutes of screen-time. Probably, that little opening monologue from Spaulding is what made me sit through the rest of the film. Thirdly, the screenplay is carved out from the Rob Zombie template that we've sat through in almost all of his films. There's lots of nudity, gore & viscera, and characters who exist just to be sliced or shot.Honestly, the shock value that Zombie delivers has depreciated over the years. He loves showcasing vicious, in-your-face violence - we all know that. But the guy still struggles to stage solid action scenes; the set-piece in Mexico is probably the worst you'll see in the entire series. And then, there's the dialogue. As opposed to The Devil's Rejects where the trio is at their sadistic peak, the dialogues in 3 from Hell seem written in an intentionally over-the-top fashion. The latest addition to the family is Foxy, Otis' half brother. As a replacement for Spaulding, Foxy is blah. As another savage Firefly, he does okay.The biggest problem with the film is its aimlessness. There's no story to be told. It's just a ""rinse & repeat"" of Baby, Otis, and Foxy killing everyone in their way. Even the kills aren't particularly intriguing in the way they're staged. The locales are new (the third act plays out in Mexico - an excuse to cut up some ratty, hostile Mexicans) but there isn't one thing that changes about the trio. Foxy even asks about midway into the movie how their story is going to proceed, to which Otis responds that he wasn't even sure they'd make it this far. In all fairness, they shouldn't have. This 115-minute flick would have made for a greater 20-minute short.",3 from Hell
28,rivertam26,Solid but unnecessary,7,13 February 2020,"I waited a while to see this entry. I was as big fan of the first two films. Despite their mixed reputations I actually find them kinda brilliant in completely different ways. Well this is much better than I thought it would be. Initially I found the idea of it just being completely unnecessary and ultimately although I felt it still kinda is I feel like it has enough going on to merit it existing. Basically after the gruesome events of the last film, the three managed to survive by just getting better and become famous murder celebrities like Manson and Bundy. Eventually they escape and go on another murder spree ending in pretty much the same spot. The movie is entertaining and creative but not very scary or horrifying. Sheriff Moon Zombie and Bill Moseley deliver their expected, underwritten lines with pizazz but lacks the punch of the previous films. Sadly the late Sid Haig is in a small portion of the film due to his illness and such. His charasmatic, demonic and likable nightmare clown is desperately missed. All in all it's an unnecessary but fun sequel that hopefully ends it all on a mostly high note.",3 from Hell
29,michaeltrivedi,Bring It To Me,7,4 November 2019,"Rob Zombie really surprised my with Lords of Salem, which is among my favorite horror movies. The first time I watched it, I walked out of the theater within probably half an hour. However, the movie grew on me, and had a creepy, haunting feel I have seen rarely before.And then we must go back to 1000 corpses. Great effort, I think the entire world got a kick out of that movie.3 From Hell is definitely a Rob Zombie movie. Very pulp fiction esque, and violent without means. But Zombie does something different here. He introduces parts in the movie that are actually grounded in reality. It becomes less of a comedy horror, and more real time life threatening horror.This movie belongs to Sherri Moon. Without her sex appeal, I think the movie would not have been as great.It's definitely worth a watch. You should definitely watch this movie if you are a horror fan. Very surprising Halloween treat of 2019.7 stars",3 from Hell
30,Pumpkin_Man,The Firefly Family is Back With a Vengeance!!!,10,6 September 2020,"When I saw The Devil's Rejects in 2005, I hated it. I hadn't seen House of 1,000 Corpses at the time, and I didn't really like how we were supposed to be sympathetic for the villains. When It was announced that Rob Zombie was remaking Halloween, my all-time favorite movie, I decided to give his work another chance, and since then, Rob Zombie has become one of my favorite musician/directors. I look forward and get hyped whenever he releases a new movie. 3 From Hell is a movie that needs to grow on you overtime. It kinda feels like filler, but it's good filler. It's basically The Devil's Rejects done again, but slightly different. There's a home invasion, then they hide out and party, then have to deal with a person that's pursuing them. I love how psychotic and delusional Baby is this time around. She's been locked up for 10 years, and has been going crazy. It's sad that this was Sid Haig's last performance as Captain Spaulding, because his health was poor in real life, so Zombie brings in Richard Brake as Winslow Foxworth ""Foxy"" Coltrane. Foxy is the half brother to Baby and Otis. He fits in pretty well.Ten years after the events of The Devil's Rejects, Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding survived the shootout with the cops and have been incarcerated ever since. Foxy breaks Otis out and they force the warden to release Baby. They decide to hide out in Mexico, but someone is waiting for them. Someone who wants revenge. This film is brutal, raw, edgy, and gritty just like Zombie's previous films. If you love Zombie's work, and the Firefly family, I would definitely recommend 3 FROM HELL!!! #FreetheThree",3 from Hell
31,Fernando-Rodrigues,The Three Hellish,6,22 February 2021,"Rob should've shelved this one. The Devil's Rejects didn't need a sequel, yet, without Sid Haig. We can't forget the weak CGI FX.

32,Neptune165,Baby's over the top acting ruined this movie for me,1,29 October 2019,"This sequel was the worst of the bunch. Danny Trejo was misused and the way they broke Baby out of jail was a joke. And the addition of Otis' brother was just too coincidental, & when they burned that man at the end is beyond ugly. They made Danny Trejos character go out so fast. Well this was underwhelming what do you expect by trying to recharge a finished story. I was super disappointed by the amount of cg blood and gunshots. It looked awful. Truly horrible acting, Sheri Zombie should get the award for the worst acting ever, it's beyond laughable. idk if rob zombie just doesn't want his wife to be killed in this franchise or what. it's just eye rolling every time they pass obstacles unscathed. a bunch of guys with military grade rifles vs. 3 people with hillbilly weapons and somehow they won without a scratch? But these are characters who were locked up in prison for years and for some reason they are better killers? This movie was cheesy and awkward from the acting. I got all the references though but it just didn't flow, it wasn't natural like how Baby just appeared and it was ""10 years later"" uhh ok? and the acting was horrendous.",3 from Hell

It looked like this movie was filmed with zero budget. EPIC FAIL,3 from Hell
37,nikola17,Rob Zombie really needs to stop directing movies,1,6 November 2019,"I think he should of being writer for this movie not any another writers i think rob zombie has destroyed this movie, but it's not just him it's other people scripts what writers write. If your fan of Rob Zombies the house of 1000 corpses, devil rejects well then this is going to be destroyed sequel ever for fans they will get pissed off, even if your fan of this franchise if your fan then your not going to like this at all. Oh god completely I wanted leave theater I really wanted to but if I do I watched this movie with my friend of mine he payed tickets for me and myself as well. Saw this in horror film at cinema nova. I like rob zombie music I am not a heavy metal fan but at least I liked some of his songs. But then him directing movies he can't direct he can't write movies Iwasn't happy with Halloween remake Halloween (2007) and Halloween II (2009) witch he knew he was going to destroy sequel and why doesn't he change it then? see if one of greatest horror director's like John Carpenter, Tobe Hopper, Wes Craven, George A Romeo, Sam Raimi if they knew they were going to destroy a film they fix it and they change it so they don't destroy their films that's why they have legacy for their film franchise. Rob Zombie is brain damage film director if he knew he was going to destroy it then how hard is it to change script, story all that and I never was fan of House of 1000 corpse I hated that film, I liked devil rejects OKAY but never was fan of that movie it'sso and so it's like first 1000 house of corpse is like a normal horror film, but then to sequel devil rejects too much of another version of National Born Killers. now this film i started to like, but the biggest most disappointed thing ever people if you think Sid Haig, Sheri Moon zombie, Bill Moseley coming back together all because you saw trailer you think it turns to be what you think, rob zombie is stealing your money and your time and your thoughts when you see trailer it's exactly how that's going to be turned out. In opening several news reports covering the events of the prior film. Through the reports, it is revealed that Baby, Otis, and Captain SpauldingMiraculously survived their shootout with the police I am like what?? They got shot like 20 times they still alive?? How in earth they are alive? I thought it's 3 from hell like they died then they come out their graves that's what I thought but no it's unrealistic way. then they were sent in death row prison now people please don't ever blink or go to bathroom or go on your phone because you have text or call you will see Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) It is the final film starring Sid Haig to be released during his lifetime when he passed away month ago then somehow in this film he is only in it for 30 seconds then Captain Spaulding dies off screen you don't see it you hear it only that he is executed by lethal injection. You can tell how rough Sid Haig was at the end, but he still brings plenty of thunder to his role, despite his short time on screen. He never appears ever again i am like he is important character infranchise now sudden he is killed off sadly?? Really then Sid Haig is only in it for 30 seconds then he dies in film? I am like why can't this film be a another type of devil rejects having them back together but no Sid Haig is killed off for nothing just waste him, and then you have (Danny trejo) Rondo saying to Otis do I know you ? He has few lines in movie then he is killed off great what a really waste of Danny Trejo wow what a use of Trejo and Sid Haig sadly. Then after that Otis brother Winslow Foxworth Coltrane (Richard Brake) So if you're curious it's not 3 from hell like devil rejects Sheri Moon Zombie, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley coming back together in one movie ha it's not it killed off Spaudliding even he is important character in film franchise? How did rob zombie expect that. So now on its 3 from hell with Bill Moseley, Moon Zombie, and Richard Brake I never expected that at all. Winslow comes to rescue Otis from prison they escape I love gore in film I liked violence all that but this film is sadly poor made so much bullcrap. Meanwhile after all murdering slaughter people as you know they kill people a lot when they escaped from prison. Stupidest part of film is when Otis tells Warden Virgil Harper ( Jeff Daniel Phillips) character is such idiot of what he was doing like Otis wants him to free Baby Sheri moon character, then he agreed on plan is because his wife is in hostage, at his home i am like you work for police you can easy make a plan out of this like this tell cops that Otis is in my house my family is hostage then pretends to free baby then he brings her to Otis then after that all SWAT, FBI, COPS would have surround the all house could done that but no he does drugs, he gets a cop uniform and baby dress like cop but would of cops, and security would have hey isn't she that killer ?? I don't know how in earth Warden got Baby free out their when it's prison with full of camera's, full of guards even if he is driving in public no one would be surprise that if they knew her then call cops ? Didn't prison guards take good look at her? But its movie it's dumb, the all movie is dumb with clown Warden hired a clown but taken as hostage who hires clowns nowadays? There weren't any kids and there's no party, the all scene is just stupid and it makes me think I wish this was a Slaright to DVD film I could rewind fast forward a scene where scene takes 10 minutes of clown doing tricks that he can't do, you have scene where naked woman is running, baby chases her and stabs her, you see a old woman cross from street, could called cops if I saw that. they killed everyone in house, they run off to Mexico I thought 3 main characters are villains but you have another villain in another side, Aquarius (Emilio Rivera) who has been in a lot of movies and shows he does okay in film he is given what to do, it's him it's writers what gave him the character, Aquarius going out to get revenge is because Rondo Danny Trejo brother or son got killed. Then I liked how Mexican gangsters or mafia and his Black Satans gang shows up for revenge. The three are tipped off by a little person named Sebastian (Pancho Moler) is in this film he is nice guy kind character but he is not villain or anything. Black Satans comes in to brothel and area with machine guns, few action scenes in movie looked really good I loved cinematography looked nice, but I wished it was in a different better movie sadly this film sucked, it's pointless, what a waste of important character you will follow Sid Haig even I am not fan of this movie franchise but I thought Sid Haig did great in 1000 house of corpse, devil rejects but he sadly used in movie as bait he died after movie was released I mean come on are is it rob zombie or writers because he needs to direct writers for this movie to stop killing of Sid haig character. Baby Firefly way over the top to the point of being frustratingly annoying. Otis still very much the samething just like devil reject hasn't changed. Winslow Foxworth Coltrane is eh okay but it's better off having Sid Haig character Captain Spaulding he is important character in film but sadly only in it 30 seconds of film saying around 4 or 5 lines then he is killed off, in off screen. well i thought this was one of worst movies ever in 2019 I wish I would never have chance to see this theater but friend of mine payed me ticket and his big fan of franchise he liked it okay but he was pissed of it as well I rated this 1.0 if you curious about this movie rent it or Netflix it don't ever put a dollar to see this movie ever if your fan of this franchise or you missed Sid Haig this is one of his last movies sadly enough he is only it for 30 seconds. just like Darren Shahlavi died after Kickboxer Vengeance he was only in it for 4 minutes then he dies lucky enough he gets screening time but Sid Haig was only, only in it for 30 seconds please people don't ever pay ticket to see this movie at all, don't ever unless you see it for free. rob zombie can't even direct or writer films I think all of his films sucked badly he should never write or direct film ever again is because he sucks at it he is no masterpiece horror director at all.",3 from Hell
38,TwistedContent,I Thouroughly Enjoyed This Flawed and Unjustified Sequel,7,6 October 2019,"""The Devil's Rejects"" is one of my all time favorite, close-to-heart horror movies & I like and respect Rob Zombie, for both his filmmaking work and even more so for his character, knowledge and mentality. ""3 From Hell"" has been one of my most anticipated movies for years, and even though I knew it's not going to be on the same level as ""The Devil's Rejects"", it still both pleased and hurt me.It's pretty clear that the justification behind the sequel is nothing but unsubstantial excuses, it's for the fan satisfaction, at the most. The plot in ""3 From Hell"" is simple, quite shallow and a tad bit too reminiscent of the story in its predecessor. However, personally I was already prepared to look past these particular flaws, because I knew that there is no Rob Zombie master plan - he himself said that he has never made a movie with any thought about continuing the story in the future. Sure, I can look past those flaws, but, admittedly, I'm a biased, I'm not the general audience in this case, therefore the mark you see up there is a 7, even though I'd want to give it an 8 and, well, it's likely that it objectively deserves a 6 in the end. All that aside, it's a brutal, fun and exciting romp of over-the-top psycho characters whom we already have learned to love. And a lot of grindhouse violence. All of the directors usual style and flair is still very much intact, the aesthetic side of the movie is exactly the kind we wanted. Soundtrack is, obviously, not as magnificent as in ""The Devil's Rejects"" but still nice & still features Terry Reid. For the horror buffs there's bonuses - a cast full of known faces and heard names, I mean every other mini role is filled in by one or another b horror icon or an otherwise known actor/actress. As to the new third member of the team, I liked him a lot, did already before, thanks to Rob Zombies ""31"". In another parallel universe I'd like to see Richard Brake portray a nasty version of Joker. It's sad to see Sid Haig go, Captain Spaulding is irreplaceable. Rest in peace, Legend.All in all, it was a bittersweet expierence, but the sweetness factor managed to be the frontrunner for me. I'm sure that I'll end up in the minority, but matter of the fact is - I'd pay for more movies with these characters and these vibes. Bring it on, Rob. And best of luck. Also, I do agree with those who say that Rob could try his hand at directing scripts written by other people. My rating: 7/10.",3 from Hell
39,mwilson1976,A fan friendly movie that won't make non fans change their opinion of Rob Zombie as a filmmaker,5,10 February 2020,"3 From Hell is director Rob Zombies concluding chapter in his Firefly trilogy, which began with House of 1000 Corpses (2003), and 2005's The Devil's Rejects (probably his best film to date). The plot follows an incarcerated Otis Driftwood and Baby Firefly (played by Bill Moseley and Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie) being busted out of jail by Otis' half-brother, after barely surviving a police shootout a decade ago. Horror icon Sid Haig briefly reprises his role as Captain Spaulding, and despite being gravelly unwell he still manages to muster up some of that old Spaulding bravado and menace in what proved to be his last ever role. The movie is full of explosive set pieces, bloody battles, and quips aplenty, but Zombies directorial style still means that this is a bit of a headache inducing movie for anybody other than his diehard fans.",3 from Hell
40,fluffchop,A lovely romp through land,8,4 August 2021,A very entertaining movie. The closing credits are great. Most horror movies should be 1:20 long as it's an ideal length. This movie is about 1:55 and yet it will leave you wanting more. The whole film is a masterpiece of story telling.,3 from Hell
41,Darkjak007,There was no reason for this movie to be made,4,1 March 2021,"I think most people can come to an understanding and even an agreement that this film shouldn't have been made there was no reason for this to be made it should've ended with the Devil's rejects. The fact that somehow they survived after having a barrage of bullets and cop cars surrounding them. The fact that they survive that makes it completely uninteresting for the majority of the film, because you're in pretty much establishing that they are pretty much immune from anything that could possibly happen to them. The movie panders for the sake of just gore and gratuitous nudity which is what Devils rejects and even House of 1000 corpses did better at showing. Also the fact that it's not even the original cast while Bill Moseley and Sherry moon zombie reprise the roles as baby and Otis. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding is executed in the opening of the film and replace with a cousin that has never been mention before. Understandably Sid Haig was Very old at this point, Which just gives another reason why the movie should have been made because so much time has passed for the cast. Another issue with this film is the fact that it is it is longer than it needs to be this movies almost 2 hours long when it should've just been like an hour and 30 at most It's been a huge chunk of the move just watch Otis and his cousin try to get a baby out of jail and then afterwords the goal some go to the warden's house torture and kill his wife and friends and then they drive towards Mexico with Mexican cartels. There's really not much else to say about this movie it's a disappointment and it was unnecessary while the Gore rather tame. The Characters just come off as stale and just more of what was already been seen before.",3 from Hell
42,theromanempire-1,Just ignore this movie ever existed......,1,31 October 2020,"The problem with this movie is not only that it's a failed....boring attempt to repeat the great devil's rejects entry BUT most important the story this movie uses simply CAN NOT EXIST.
for everyone who watched how the devil's reject film ended knows we can't have another sequel with those guys back cause simply those guys are NOT ALIVE anymore and the ending of the previous movie made sure for that.
in my book if your name is NOT Jason or freddy or myers and u get.......20 bullets like those guys did u are simply A DEAD PERSON and u can't come back for another sequel. simple as that. crystal lake clear. end of story.
this ""detail"" ruined the movie for me from the beginning but even if u watch it as a stand alone film it's not worth it like the previous two films did especially the second film which in reality was THE ONLY GREAT FILM rob did.

44,elliotte2,This was almost a parody of itself.,2,14 May 2020,"This was a mess from the beginning. This was absolutely horrible. Anyone that like the first two will hate this one. This movie plays almost as a parody of the first two....more at a lame attempt of comedy than anything serious. Had the tone and directing style of Natural Born Killers.....with a shoestring budget. Biggest gripe? None of the scenarios was remotely believable. Example, a person responsible for 38 murders would not be working on jail release on side of road. That would be like Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson picking up trash along the highway....never ever happen. That type of dumbness is one of about 13 similar dumb scenes.Other dumb scenes:
1. Two escaped murderous convicts and the warden leaves his wife at home alone?
2. Convict who while shackled beat up three guards...but a day later a single guard escorts her?
3. Three trained mercenaries with automatic weapons with the element of surprise at point blank range(across a hotel room) are taken out by bow/arrow and knife(remember in a hotel room with element of surprise).Just no....",3 from Hell
45,youngcollind,Not breaking new ground but still having fun with a well worn franchise,6,2 May 2021,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for what Zombie puts on the table. Always a frantic metal video on the silver screen, it's a good ride even when the material isn't brilliant. As should be expected of the third of any franchise, this movie isn't groundbreaking. In the beginning it showed promise to put something new on the table, but by the end it was just repeating the beats of the Devil's Rejects with a little Robert Rodriguez thrown in for good measure. It moves at a fast enough pace that it's no chore to get through, just not gonna blow your mind. Sherri is still a pleasure and inhabits the Baby character better than any of the final girls she's played in Rob's last few flicks. All in all, a victory lap for what's been a fun film series.",3 from Hell
46,bastos,The worst of the trilogy,4,15 September 2020,"Rob Zombie is not a bad director, he knows his horror and knows how to make intense and shocking movies. His weakness are his scripts which many times are just derivative and unoriginal, trying too much to be like the movies he likes. Maybe he should look at the work of Tarantino, as a good example of mimicking what he loves while making something truly original. The problem here is that The Devil's Rejects didn't leave much room for a sequel, and the setup here feels a bit forced, but the main problem I had with this movie was that Rob Zombie spent a lot of time trying to make this characters come back from the spot they were at the end of the previous movie and then he had absolutely nothing to do with them. If you want to make a sequel to Rejects you better have something to say, because that movie ended pretty well, and here it seems that someone challenged him to do a sequel and he accepted the challenge just out of pride. He had absolutely no story to tell and nothing to, at least, keep us entertained, making this a boring sequel with some very sparse sparks from the past. Also Sid Haig was sorely missed.",3 from Hell
47,Gresh854,Keeping Up with the Fireflies,2,17 September 2019,"I like House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects, but this legit was one of the most unnecessary, tedious sequels of all-time. 'Tis a shame. ;(",3 from Hell
48,TuesdayThe17th,Oh...you still wanna have a Halloween party??,8,18 October 2019,"The unflinching third installment in the ""Rejects"" trilogy, ""3 From Hell"" cooks up some raw carnage and mayhem with lots of bloodshed and served with a side of black wit. Masterful cinematography and fine editing are a bonus here since even though ""31"" wad gory and in my opinion a good movie, it had some major editing and set issues. Per usual, Zombie directs a group of over 50, disheveled and washed up looking horror icons with bad attitudes. Or as he might refer to them, derelicts. We wouldn't expect anything other than from one of horrors truest and rawest directors. Zombie's cast is always great and is never a complaint. However, many disgruntled fans can't stop complaining about the absence of Sid Haig and the addition of Richard Brake... Allow me to clear that up for some. I met Sid thoroughly at a convention in 2017. He was old. Very old. Me and my girlfriend couldn't believe how absent minded he was. He got up to use the bathroom and one of his security guards had to find him because he literally got lost on his way back to the table. It was wild to see him aimlessly wandering around cluelessly in search of his booth that he walked by several times. It was clear to me then that Mr. Haig wouldn't be gracing the screen anymore. A year or so later when i heard about ""3 From Hell"" and how Did was gonna be starring, i knew it wouldn't happen. The guy was just too damn old. His 3 minute appearance in this film DOES work well and if you ask me, Foxy was a good addition to the crew. You cant always have everything you want. A couple notes: people are saying the 3rd act feels so different from the first 2. Umm hellllloooooo people this is what nake for a unique story telling experience. The 3rd act isn't bad different. Its surprising different and I think it fits in very nicely actually. Any true fan of Rob' s would know that this is a tactic used by Rob often. He did this in Halloween, as well as basically in ""Corpses"" and ""Rejects""... This is all positive stuff. Another thing is people are saying Bill's character was too underwhelming and Sheri's over the top. Um hello, no. Think about the story arcs. Otis is much older and wiser. And fatter lol. Otis just kind of chills now and is maybe on his way out if you will. He is aloof while baby, who has completely lost her marbles from being locked up for so long, goes buckwild with crazy behavior. This all fits into the story very nicely. Yes, Otis comes off breezy but he is just tired. Tired from a long life of criminal activity and running. Anywho, there are many good cameos in this film and much blood to be shed. The digital blood everyone speaks of actually works. people are being very picky. This isn't a 50 mil budget film folks c'mon. Though not as gritty as ""Rejects"", I am very pleased with this movie and can't wait to see what Rob does next.",3 from Hell
49,Otkon,Nope. Zombie still hasn't learned to pare down his thoughts.,3,6 October 2019,"Not when it comes to his writing, his camera work, his editing. Anything. He writes it all, films it, puts it all in. A character will do something, then immediately tell you what they just did. Zombie has to throw in references to past movie stars and movies then explain why. He can't take his tracking camera off his wife - who CANNOT act - until an song plays for far too long to hammer in the lyrical significance. Then he plays the same song diegetically when his 80's-style full-length music video tribute to his spouse ends. SCREAM.Because he throws in everything hoping something works, he continues to cause problems with the pacing of his filmed experiments. This one is very slow at two hours. And not nearly as violent as it should have been. It's fairly talky and fairly corny.",3 from Hell
50,QueenoftheGoons,Still don't know what to think,2,26 October 2021,"I watched it for Sid Haig and Alvarez.

52,droog-56936,Someone Give Zombie More $,6,18 October 2019,Though much of it is visually interesting Rob Zombie needs someone to tighten up his scripts and expand his storylines. Not much here is new or expands the universe of these characters. However it is often really cool to look at and Zombie's directorial flair for the structure of the MTV video format really can keep you engaged enough to at least be entertained. The obvious lower budget of Zombie's newer movies is also a hindrance to him realizing his full vision. This feels claustrophobic in a not good way while Devil's Rejects felt expansive and open.Still worth a watch.,3 from Hell

I just can't wrap my head around this 3rd installment. House of 1000 corpses is by far the greatest horror movie ever made but when Rob took the firefly family off the property of horrors from the first film of the trilogy it just started to fall apart.

56,80sHorror,"Rob Zombie's increasingly uninspired, unoriginal and lacklustreb imagination.",1,9 November 2019,"More adolescent, infantile rubbish from a director who clearly has a fetish for Manson family glorification. Zombie thinks you can get away with anything as long as it looks cool. Well that's unfortunate because it doesn't look cool, it looks boring.Rob Zombie movies are always panned by critics but as a bit of a gorehound I can still enjoy films like 'House of 1000 Corpses' and 'Devil's Rejects' for what they are, unsophisticated, nasty exploitation horror. I even kind of liked his remake of Halloween despite completely missing the mark of what made the original so great.3 From Hell is the third movie about the deranged Firefly family and it's a hot mess from start to finish. The opening news report is a taster of what you can expect from Zombie'e unsubtle and boring screenplay which gives none of the characters an interesting thing to say. Apparently at the final shootout in 'Devil's Rejects' all three of the killers survived twenty gunshots each at odds of a million to one and now languish in prison. Sid Haig could only manage to be on set for one day due to his failing health therefore we get one scene featuring Captain Spaulding before he is hastily executed to conveniently write him out of the story. As the most interesting character and performer he is sorely missed. Bill Mosley reprises his role of Otis Driftwood who escapes from his work detail when the half brother Midnight Wolfman (Rick Brace) comes to bust him out. A nasty home invasion on the prison warden gets Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie) freed and that's about it. There's no plot, no point, no social commentary, no interesting characters, just one grisly murder after another. Sheri Moon is so unbelievably annoying at trying to act crazy I would have switched this crud off had I not paid almost a fiver to rent it. Mallory Knox she ain't.There are numerous nods to Natural Born Killers but 3 From Hell says nothing and adds nothing to modern cinema.

It's a brutal and intense epic chapter of old school crime, horror and exploitation, aka a hardcore family film, with great actors, tons of blood, violence and action, lots of fun and dark humor, spectacular slow motion sequences, amazing cinematography and a badass soundtrack. The first hour feels like a crime, exploitation, horror film and the second hour feels like a Robert Rodriguez action, gangster, thriller film. It's really sad we didn't get to see a lot of the iconic Sid Haig in his last performance as Captain Spaulding but his scene is memorable. Sheri Moon Zombie gives her greatest performance, ever as Baby Firefly and she is just beautiful and totally crazy! In my opinion, the legendary Bill Moseley as Otis Driftwood steals the show once again in this chapter and he looks really great for his age and is even more badass and evil than ever. Richard Brake is just simply awesome as Foxy, aka The Midnight Wolfman, the newest member in the Firefly family and the half-brother of Otis and Baby. Also, great performances from Jeff Daniel Phillips, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Lucinda Jenney, Sean Whalen, Pancho Moler, Emilio Rivera and many more. I love this movie so much and it's up there with House Of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, and if you are a fan of those films, you are going to dig this sequel. But if you are a diehard Rob Zombie fan just like me, you are going to love this sequel a lot.

It Could Happen Just Like With The Lords Of Salem.

75,timetopooptoday,MUST see this 3rd installment,10,24 October 2019,"The thing is, most sequels leave at least something to be desired, or are never as good as the initial film. I really liked the first film, House of 1000 Corpses. I LOVED Devil's Rejects which somehow, was better than the first installment. I really didn't expect this 3rd part, Three From Hell to be as good as it was. Somehow Zombie keeps improving and redeeming himself again and again. It's great ongoing storytelling that holds your attention with stellar acting and incredible atmosphere that no one else can quite capture.Of course we all miss Cutter, Tiny and Madame Firefly but all of the original characters returned with some new ones and some new twists and with all that considered, we have an incredible piece that continues the saga. The series just isn't complete without Baby and Otis and they're front and center so no worries. And this time? It's early 1980's gritty reality creepy in all the right ways.I actually bought the unrated version upon release because well, I've been watching this story forever. Something about this story and these movies makes you want to see it again and again so it's just easier to own it. That sounds weird for me to say since I'm a horror / thriller fan but not usually a gore fan. Something about these movies though is cerebral. Anyway, from the start it seems to pick up where the last movie left off without missing a beat. And interestingly, this one too ends with the question: will there be another one. (Yes please!)",3 from Hell

Rob zombie should of immediately started production for a prequel after devils rejects. Instead of using the time and money for the Halloween remake. He should of focused on a prequel. That way the actors would of been able to reprise their roles alot easier. But oh well..i didn't hate this film but i don't love it like i do devils rejects.",3 from Hell
77,derek-a-charette100,Very underwhelming.,4,18 August 2021,"Two hours ago I learned that this movie exists, and I instantly had to find it and watch it, being as it's a sequel to a masterpiece.With that considered, the bar was set very high from the start, and I expected four things out of it;
1) I would be entertained;
2) I would be grossed out by gore;
3) I would see some disturbingly psychotic scenes that would haunt me;
4) I would not be able to predict the script.Sadly, only one of these expectations were met.. but you'll have to watch it if you want to know which one it was! ;)Surely many people will enjoy this movie because it's not THAT bad, but I set a very high bar for it before I watched it. I will even go as far as explaining why the Devil's Rejects is such a special movie to me...I have such fond memories of The Devil's Rejects, back when I was younger in my late teens and early 20's. I used to be a stoner and we would always be hanging out in groups of friends because I grew up in a small town of 6,000 so all of us younger ones knew each other and we would have a 'party' almost every night between us, and we would just go over to each other's places when we saw that a few people were over, and we would either watch movies in the dark we all had black lights and those bright glowing hippie posters and big water bongs and we had so many good nights. I'm sure many of you can relate!One of the things over those 6-7 years of the best years of my life were the movie parties with all of our friends. One of our favorites was always The Devil's Rejects. We all watched it countless times, but nobody ever complained, we all just sat there and watched it as thought it was a new movie we had never seen before because it was such a cool and captivating flick.In 3 From Hell's defense, The Devil's Rejects is held to the standards of a short list of the best of the best... like Scarface, Goodfellas, Rambo, Pulp Fiction, Casino, the Bourne series, for examples. This is no list to scoff at.. these are timeless classics. Attempting to make sequels to a movie like this is a big gamble. The marketing potential of this sequel is through the roof, it's like someone handing you the keys to a new mansion and burying them in a pile with 1,000,000 non-working keys, and all you have to do is dig for long enough and you will find the right keys if you put in the effort and cherish your good fortune no matter how long it will take to find the keys.In 3 From Hell, Rob got tired of looking for the key and walked away. Sorry Rob but I don't feel bad for you. Get Tarantino to write and direct a 3rd movie to make this a trilogy.",3 from Hell

79,darklydreamingrahu,A Competent Sequel to The Devil's Rejects and Return to Form for Zombie,8,22 October 2019,"I like Rob Zombie's movies. It's a guilty pleasure, and I'm not ashamed.I even liked Halloween 2.However, I can't deny that The Devil's Rejects is good outside of the realm of the Zombieverse. It's a film with backbone that relentlessly moves with a frenetic tension. It's a classic in the horror genre.It's long-awaited sequel, Three from Hell, was never going to be as good as The Devil's Rejects, a film that brought a genre-bending freshness to horror back in 2005.However, Three from Hell convincingly captures its predecessor's energy while adding its own flavor to the series.And Sheri Moon Zombie gives her most bonkers performance yet as Baby Firefly.Baby has been in solitary confinement for a decade, and she has finally gone mad and encompassed the role of Mother Firefly from the previous films. She has almost completely turned into her mother, and watching Mother Firefly's mannerisms mesh with Baby's unhinged, child-like playfulness is a joy(?) to watch.As fun as Baby is to watch, it is Otis and his half brother, the Midnight Wolfman, who are the film's central characters. And these actors pull their roles off to perfection. They truly feel like diabolical loose-cannon prison escapees. They have a great on-screen chemistry, although Wolfman's Firefly origin story makes little to no sense without more explanation. Thankfully, their electric and maniacal portrayals almost make up for it.The dialogue and cinematography are what you'd expect from an exceptional Zombieverse film in the Firefly series. I mean, it IS about Psychotic trailer trash serial killers that do everything in excess, and that's what you get.It's definitely not The Devil's Rejects, but it doesn't have to be. Three from Hell stands on its own as another fun Grindhouse-like exploitation film from a divisive director who has created his own unique atmosphere and distinctive setting in his movies. You either like it or you don't.It's upper-eschelon in Zombie's filmography.As a Devil's Rejects sequel, its 6.8/10
As a Zombieverse film, it's an 8/10",3 from Hell
80,dreamingskychild,"I love the first two, but this one is still great!",8,12 February 2020,"I love House of 1000 Corpses so much, and The Devil's Rejects. They are both awesome and unique films by Rob Zombie in my opinion. I am a fan of his music too. I had no idea a third film 3 From Hell had been made until last night, and honestly I was glued to the screen from beginning till end. I really enjoyed it! Who am I to pass up a reunion with the remaining members of the infamous Firefly family? For what it's worth, I personally think it was sweet. I can definitely empathize with people's disappointment in Sid Haig not having a larger role in this film, but in reviews here, people are quick to cast judgement that Rob Zombie was a fool or is without talent anymore for making a decision. Understand however that Sid Haig was originally going to have a larger role, but was unable to commit to the whole film due to severe health issues. As a result, the script had to be rewritten to introduce Richard Brake's character to take his place, and I think he did a decent job as a new character. I found out that Sid passed away shortly after the film was released, may the legend rest in peace. On a final note, I would say, don't be so quick to judge this film considering the circumstances. Take it for what it is, not a film to outdo or mimic the others, just one last giddy-up ride with the last of the Firefly family for the fans. Enjoy!",3 from Hell

84,Kolobos51,Zombie bounces back after a series of fan alienating films.,8,18 September 2019,"Rob Zombie is possibly the most controversial, off beat, and, in my opinion, interesting filmmaker working today. But after the trippy Halloween 2, the downright surreal Lords of Salem, and the haphazard 31, he is on shaky ground with his own fanbase. And I openly admit I enjoy all of his crazy, wild, over the top movies to varying degrees. But I get why people didn't love his last three movies. So maybe it was logical he would go back to the well and bring back his most iconic characters for a direct follow up to his undisputed masterpiece, The Devil's Rejects.As it turns out, Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), and Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) all survived the bloody shootout at the climax of the previous movie. My buddies have a fan theory that it has something to do with Dr. Satan but he is not mentioned here. All three are in jail 10 years later and the film opens with an interview from Spaulding and Otis. Soon after, Otis stages a bloody prison break with his never-before-mentioned petty crook brother Winslow (Richard Brake who the played the great villain Doom Head in Zomvie's previous movie 31).Otis, eager to solidify his name as ""Public enemy No. 1"", and WInslow, a goofy but dangerous sidekick along for the ride, decide their next move is to break Baby out of jail. In the meantime, Baby has gone absolutely NUTS during her time in jail and she babbles, rages, and attacks, making life miserable for the guard stuck watching her (an unrecognizable Dee Wallace).The prison warden is a good old boy jerk played by Zombie regular Jeff Daniel Phillips. He and Otis have a Hannibal Lecter vs. Dr. Chilton style rivalry that we know will have to pay off. But there are plenty of others aware of the notorious Firefly cult.I have to say two things about this movie. First, I loved the first half of this movie. It does everything I wanted out of a Devil's Rejects follow up. The cast is great, the violence is brutal, and the dark, vulgar humor Zombie enjoys so much mostly lands. It is fantastic seeing evil antihero Otis back to murdering and mayhem while it's fun seeing Baby back in action and literally nuttier than ever. I also love that Rob Zombie refuses to back off his fearless, grimy, and utterly un-PC style. This is a mean, nasty movie that makes no apologies and in an era of overly cautious, tame entertainment this is a great antidote to the safe spaces we are used to.The down side is that the movie is a little on the plotless side. It feels like a prison break movie but the second half of the movie, which involves a trip to Mexico, feels almost like a totally new movie has suddenly started. At that point, 3 From Hell suddenly feels less like a psycho horror movie and more like a Sam Peckinpah movie on crack.I also wish Sid Haig and Danny Trejo, who returns as one half of the bounty hunter duo the Unholy Two, had more than just cameos. I have to admit that I kind of enjoyed how totally amoral this movie is. Otis and his crew are the leads and this flick never pretends that the 3 from Hell are not its literal heroes. But others might take issue with that.I liked this thing a lot and it is good time for fans of rough and brutal cinema. It's just a little under devloped. But Rob Zombie should win some fans back and I truly hope we get another evil adventure with the Firefly clan in the future.Edit: Sid Haig's reduced role was apparently due to his failing health and not any kind of artistic decision on the part of Zombie. Rob Zombie apparently worked very hard to ensure Sid Haig was in this movie at all. And at least Sid Haig got that one last good movie before his death.RIP Sid Haig, a clown that danced for us all for nearly 50 years.",3 from Hell

I totally understand he was sick during filming but it's Hollywood you could have done memories from his older movies and let's not forget the great Bill Moseley what he has done with Otis's character has us horror fans demanding to see more Otis so maybe if there's a part 4 we want more otis also try toning down babies character some go back to the devil's rejects baby but to sum it up i still loved this sequel it has what we expect to see in a rob zombie film blood guts and plenty of violence i give it 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,3 from Hell

88,RudeArtAndDesign_Com,A Number 2 From Hell,4,7 November 2019,"Rob Zombies' Filmography Is Like A Day Of Painful Diarrhea.
Just a heads-up this review is gonna stink for a second but, I'll get to ""3 From Hell"" shortly.On my way to see Zombie's first film the masterful House of 1,000 Corpses. I remember we were having a horrible storm, stuck in heavy traffic and having a hard time finding parking... I was getting worried I wouldn't get to the seat in time and maybe even have an accident. After a frightful anxiety filled trip I finally got to the theater sat down and how good it felt. And oh how much I enjoyed it but, sadly it would be the only 'solid' material he would ever put out.Now I could go on here and list how with each successive time he sits on the director's seat he seems to flush his career and his fans' opinions of him. Because each film seems to lose more of that special blend of creativity, dark humor, creepiness and clownish fun that made 1,000 Corpses such a sturdy well formed hunk of horror movie film-making. If he were to grow as a film-maker with each next movie the ideas, the creativty should flow and become bigger and better than the last. But instead each film seems more and more watered down than the previous with just chunks of that promising originality occasionally rising to the surface. Sadly with each movie now we see something even more watered down and has so much less of those special floating chunks of inspiration that made 1,000 Corpses such a fantastic start to a film career. Each film is just so much more painful than the last and seems to stink so much more.And now we get to ""3 From Hell"" this movie is a gigantic steaming pile of doo-doo (haha bet, you thought I was gonna say steaming pile of $h!t) But seriously, it's pretty bad it's just gore porn with little to no redeeming qualities. Not all movies need to enrich our lives, open our minds or make the world a better place, some are just meant to entertain. Some movies just go for that lowest common denominator type of humor or horror or whatever and succeed well and really entertain in doing so. However this film and I'm affraid Zombie's career at this point can only aspire to reach as high as lowest... and can't even reach that.",3 from Hell

Also the use of CGI was excessive and very noticeable. I really don't know how I feel about it. I look at as a stand-alone film. Watch it for your self and make your own opinion.

92,alesisqs61,Better than I thought - minor spoilers,7,5 October 2019,"The trailer made it look lower budget than the actual film is, thank goodness. The film does change the dynamics of the characters and give them a bit of humanity this time, which surprised me but I guess unless characters change there's no point in telling the same old story again.
I'd even go as far as saying they turn into Anti-Heroes which is ridiculous in real life but since they managed to get out of the US it's a different world where they are going. It turns out there are even worse people than them which just do it for money. I think Rob is trying to say there are no real evil people as he mirrors guns for hire vs their incessant need to kill for free. In the end it's still fear and death. Baby was quite likable once they decided to just have fun and defend themselves vs the hit squad. After jail she does seem far more unhinged and she really needed that trip to blow off some steam. Another funny point is when they were talking, they mention they don't need to create enemies at every turn and push themselves into a corner because the next corner really might be their last. This isn't as good as TDRs, but it's better than House of 1000 corpses by far. I didn't even like that film to be honest.",3 from Hell

If you don't know his movies, they are low grade exploitation movies with an overabundance of gore, and each and every one of the characters in his movies range between incomprehensibly stupid to pure evil, there aren't even remotely decent characters, they're all bad. This is yet another movie where there is zero range in the story. It is evil people doing evil things, from the start to the finish. No rebuttal, no plot points, no evolution, no real adversity, no variety, zero drama, tension, anything to care about in the least. It's psychopathic filmmaking. Yet again the tone of the film is not that these are evil people, but that they are shown that as they are evil by nature, they're not evil, because they can't help it. It's a group of sociopathic mass murderers, mass murdering, and all their victims are zero sided, and some of them are just braindead, never do you care about any of the murders. It's a reprehensible style of storytelling. Beyond the awful story and awful characters, it's the same Rob Zombie staple of starring his real life wife, and his friends, with atrociously bad and terrible dialogue, with several conversations which barely make any sense. The visual style has frequent freeze frames, picture slides, slow motion, grainy shots, old TV shots, all without rhyme or reason.",3 from Hell

I was embarrassed that I had memories of actually liking some of these characters. This movie dropped the ball big time. I don't know who was more annoying - Rob Zombie's untalented wife or that Coltrane guy. Who??? I don't recall this guy in the other movies. I guess since Sid Haig wasn't even in the movie they needed a 3rd bozo to keep it called ""3 from Hell"". If you make this movie into a drinking game whenever the word MFer is used, you'll be dead by alcohol poisoning by 46 minutes.

The audience could take sides based on their own perspectives.3 From Hell has none of that. Otis and Baby are clearly the antihero's of this story, and only kill people who 'deserved' it. We the audience are firmly on their side. There is no horror or suspense because we don't care about any of the people in danger. Plus, the lack of Sid Haig really hurts the movie. Richard Brake gave a good effort, but without Captain Spaulding, this just feels like a completely different series.If you liked the previous two movies, you'll find something to like about 3 From Hell, but it still lacks what was so special about The Devils Rejects.",3 from Hell
100,crousbrandon,"Unnecessary, but good Sequel SPOILERS!!",7,25 October 2019,"First of all, I do agree with some people that we could have done without a sequel to the awesome devils rejects. Did I dislike the movie, certainly not, there were some things that I thought could have been done better but that's out of my control. So we start off immediately following rejects, the film opens in a Manson style documentary to tell us exactly how they survived and that they will be sent to prison for their crimes, this is definitively the best part of the movie, the documentary part , (given that the film is a prison movie , a home invasion movie and a Mexican movie.) The scenes with them in prison, especially baby, was great. We then move on to the middle part after Otis escapes they break into the warden of baby's prison's home and hold him and his friends hostage forcing him to help them free baby from prison. This was akin to the hotel scenes in devil's rejects, that scenes was however better and more shocking, this one is not bad but not great either and its a little boring at times. We do however get an awesome stabbing scene with baby , very brutal and the best kill and only shocking kill in the entire movie. After this they hang out in a hotel for less than 10 minutes and they decide to escape to mexico, our final part of the movie. This part was probably the best part after the opening scenes. Here they standoff against Rondo's son, who Otis killed earlier.So overall I liked the movie, I liked the acting especially Sheri moon zombie who gives her best performance yet! Baby is even crazier here that even Otis is concerned about her, I mean she chases a naked woman down a suburban neighborhood in broad daylight and violently kills her on some old lady's lawn, that should give you and idea. Bill mosely also once again plays his Otis character very well. Richard brake does a good job of portraying the half brother, Dee Wallace plays a lesbian prison gaurd , she chews the scenes very well!. The story was not thin , but I think rob could have done better with it. The opening should have been longer! Did is only in the movie about 5 min given did Haig's health. The style and everything I have no problem with. Loved the slow mo shots with baby
Now there's nothing overly graphic or heavy shocking here except baby stabbing the warden's wife. Rejects and corpses was way more shocking. Even the unrated cut is all that there not really much extra gore. Mayne rob had calmned down a bit given his age.This movie looks great on Blue ray!!!.
So overall I'm giving it a seven. I'll definitely watch it again. Unnecessary but good.

106,skywalker7471,Just awful...,1,7 October 2019,Easily one of the worst films ever made... Rob Zombie should just stop making films as he's not very good at it...an awful epitaph for the late Sid Haig...avoid at all costs.,3 from Hell
107,amandagellar-31077,They Should Have Left Well Enough Alone,5,19 September 2019,"I was lukewarm on House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Devil's Rejects remains one of the most interesting horror films of the past 15/20 years, so I was eagerly awaiting to see what Rob Zombie would do to bring his Firefly clan back. Pretty soon into the film, I realized that, sometimes, it's better to end on a high note than to drag things out past their expiration dates.After their 70's killing spree, the Firefly clan have been sent to prison. They quickly write out Captain Spaulding (due to Sid Haig's poor health) and bring in a character we've never even seen or heard of before that's supposed to be some sort of half-brother of Otis and Baby (played by Richard Brake). He helps them escape and pretty soon they're back on the run, murdering and causing havoc wherever they go.Structurally, 3 From Hell is more Devil's Rejects than House of 1,000 Corpses, but the problem is they copy that structure to a T. Once the gang's back, there's a siege upon two couples that's very much like the siege upon the country band in The Devil's Rejects. After that, they all get in a van and end up in Mexico which feels just like the scenes in Ken Foree's ranch in that same film. There's also a character who wants to avenge a family member who died at the hands of the Firefly family like in that film. It feels like Rob Zombie took the structure of that film and just barely changed a few details to make it seem different enough to greenlight.3 From Hell feels like one of those great TV shows that's managed to overstretch itself out into 2 or 3 more mediocre and unnecessary seasons where the actors and writers we used to love are mostly going through the motions. It feels oddly passionless and pedestrian throughout as if everyone was just trying to play it safe enough until they could get their paycheck. There are a few highs here and there, but it's far from a return to form or a necessary addition to the series.",3 from Hell

I am also a fan of House of 1000 corpses, but didn't like the Devil's rejects as much.That being said, this movie feels like I've seen it before.. It's just another take on the same story. I didn't think house of 1000 corpses deserved a sequel, never-mind a trilogy. It felt like this was just a new take on the cult-classic Natural Born killers.

The acting was great. Knowing about Sid's health during this time makes me ok with Spalding's limited appearance in the movie. The kills were gory, the language and nudity was on par with what I expected from a Zombie horror film. Was it the best movie ever? No. Was it worth of a 1-4 star rating?

Otis and Foxy are ok, but nowhere near as over the top as the two actors were in previous Rob Zombie flicks. They seem almost normal--compared to Baby.If you like the cute, simpering ""I'm the only hope you've got. My brother Otis is crazy"" Baby of previous films, you are in for a disappointment. This time around, it is up to Otis to rein in his little sister.I for one am glad that Baby has grown up to be a natural born killer in her own right. The director (her husband) owed it to her after what he put her through in Devil's Rejects--that short dress and her screams as she ran from the vengeful police detective.

114,mildlymorbidx,Had potential,7,24 October 2019,You really need to watch the special features after watching this movie. There were so many rewrites by Zombie because of Sid Haigs failing health. He had to make a decision at one point to scrap the movie all together or continue. Since he was constantly hounded by fans of TDR he made the movie. Unfortunately there was nothing new or interesting that happened. The addition of the half-brother character didnt add anything. They didnt give him much of a personality. Bill Moseley is the best thing about this movie. They did give Baby a little more development which was nice. It was very hard watching the scenes with Sid Haig. I didnt see this until after his passing and you can see just how frail he was at that point. You will be missed Capt.,3 from Hell
115,Joetampa90,Cheap and Silly 3 From Hell is Barely Enjoyable *Mild Spoilers*,5,17 September 2019,"Rob Zombie is back with a sequel to what many consider his best movie 'Devil's Rejects'. 3 From Hell puts us back with Otis, Baby Firefly and Captian Spalding. Well, barely Spalding but he is in the film. This movie feels very pointless and aimless and suffers from a lot of questionable and silly writing/plot points. However, if you're a hardcore Zombie fan there is no doubt something here to please you.3 From Hell does have a pretty strong first half. Starting by giving the viewer a fairly unsatisfying explanation as to how the Rejects survived the finale of the last movie. Then comes the prison escape which later shows to be a major plot point for the second half. I felt like this half had some great gore, some pretty interesting new characters and some funny moments too. However, to get back to my earlier point on silly writing... In the middle of what would be considered a very tense and dark part of the story, a clown shows up. A clown you would hire for a children's party, but there is no party going on... and why he pops in is never explained. We get 7 or so minutes of him being around and then that's that. It was very bizarre and way out of left field.The second half of the movie is where the wheels really fall off. Throughout 3 From Hell you can sense the fact that Zombie was working with a low budget and it starts to show in the back half of the movie when Otis and company head to Mexico. You don't care about the revenge aspect because it felt slapped together. Things get more silly and more unrealistic than ever here. The final kill of the movie absoultely showcases the low budget and was frankly horrible, I'm talking something you'd see in a made for SciFi Network movie.With this being said if you can turn your brain off and just enjoy it for what it is, maybe glorified fan service even... then you can come away somewhat satisfied. The gore, for the most part, was very strong brutal and enjoyable. The dialouge has moments of vile disgust as well. The characters are still fun even with some overacting and comically bad moments from Sherri Zombie. But make no mistake about it 3 From Hell is not a good movie.",3 from Hell
116,kzucc-37279,Coming from a huge Zombie fan....,1,24 October 2019,Devil's Rejects was fantastic. This? I wanted so badly to love this. I really did. I watched it twice. And just... no. I want more from Zombie as I am a major fan of his work but this was just... bad. It could be broken down and discussed but plain and simple? Its just bad.,3 from Hell
117,kzucc-37279,Seriously Rob?,1,29 October 2019,"*Spoiler* This movie is awful. Not even remotely good at any point. If you choose to watch it, be warned, your time will vanish along with brain cells. Bill Moseley may need back surgery after carrying this mess. Praise to Sid for doing what he could for his cameo. Sheri... oh dear Sheri. There's acting insane (Kathy Bates in MISERY) then there is just acting insanely annoying. As an avid Zombie fan from day one, I can say this was clearly a cash grab. I love how Zombie pushes the edge of what cab be released in theaters, I truly do, but a script where every other word is ""F"", that doesnt make it edgy anymore it just makes it lazy. As much as I want to support all of Rob's work, I prefer to pretend this movie never happened and leave it at Rejects.",3 from Hell
118,utslitt,"I'm not mad, Zombie. I'm just disappointed.",3,19 October 2019,"When I first heard that Rob Zombie was getting the gang back together for a third chapter in the Firefly family's journey, some pretty bittersweet emotions were experienced. It wasn't just myself that felt a confusing mixture of ""but, why?"" and ""HECK YES."" It seemed as though a lot of Firefly following online didn't think this needed to happen, but welcomed it anyway with an anticipation so unsure you could feel the tension a mile away.The day of its release, 3 from Hell answered all of our questions we didn't have about Otis, Baby, and Spaulding until its conception. Was the answer we needed satisfying? Was the film as good as we were hoping to be? Were the Firefly family truly back again to cause just as much havoc as we've seen them cause before?This review could potentially be my shortest yet, as one could easily sum this movie up with two words: ""womp womp."" How unfortunate 3 from Hell didn't live up to expectations; especially when the expectations across the net weren't that high to begin with. I'll go ahead and get my few compliments for it out of the way, and then we'll sit here and drown in the negativity, because I'm dead serious when I say this one was a stinker.1.) Otis is more palatable, less over-the-top. (This could also be a negative)
2.) Richard Brake knocked it out of the park as Wolfman. Literally the only saving grace of the movie.
3.) Stellar soundtrack typical of Zombie's filmsThere. Now that those two bits are out of the way, let's dig in.If you look at the description above that I screenshot from just a simple ""3 from Hell"" Google search, you can see that the description states ""Crazed killers Baby Firefly, Captain Spaulding and Otis Driftwood unleash blood mayhem after escaping from prison."" That's two-thirds of the way correct. Due to his health, it was understandable that Sid Haig couldn't be a big part of the Firefly reunion. In the film, Captain Spaulding is understandably sentenced to death, and while we thought he was killed in the car scene from Rejects, this was an OK way for him to go as well, imo. So, no, Google, Spaulding doesn't escape from prison.One of the immediate questions that sparked for everyone as soon as 3 from Hell was announced was: ""they're not dead?"" The last time we saw the three, they were headed full speed ahead into a hail of bullets, not backing down from a fight, and as a result - being pumped full of lead. Shockingly, they survived. I have so many unorganized thoughts on this alone that when I go to speak on it, all that comes out is a deep, audible sigh. Before this film, they had the death they deserved, and one that fans were happy with even. Now they're suddenly alive? It doesn't make sense, but there wouldn't be a 3 from Hell if it didn't happen that way, I guess.We don't see too much of Otis in prison, but we do see quite a bit of Baby in prison, and she isn't doing so good. She's got a number of violations, not applicable for parole, and what's left of her sanity is swirling down the drain as we see her firsthand experiencing hallucinations while in segregation. Moon's acting is what you'd expect, but this time around it doesn't feel like Baby is... Baby. Yeah, that's the character on screen, but something is off. It's not because she's behind bars, but it's because her character is seemingly forced to the point I just don't care anymore. I get it, you're mentally unstable, but unfortunately now, you're just not interesting or half as compelling as you were once before.Otis on the other hand, a character that shouldn't under any circumstances be allowed to see the light of day, nor have his cunning taken for granted, has his cunning taken for granted as he's given a chance to see the light of day and uses this to his advantage to escape all on which is caught on camera. Predictable, right? This scene gives us a brief shot of Danny Trejo before he takes a laughably bad (beyond rotten) CGI effect of a bullet to the head. With the help of his half-brother we've never heard of til now, Otis makes his escape. Where does he go? Straight to the Warden's house to work on getting Baby freed.I hated the scenes at the Warden's house. Despite the fantastic performance of everyone involved, they just felt empty. The terror was visible as those held hostage are being hurt with no remorse by one of America's most wanted, but other than the purpose of getting Baby back into the world, these scenes seemingly had no point. We already know what Otis is capable of, and Wolfman being a relative of Otis and Baby, we get that he's liable to be one bad mammajamma himself. That being said, why did these scenes have to drag on so freaking long?With Baby now out of prison, Otis makes the comment to his brother that prison did a lot of damage to Baby as what was left of her sanity is beyond gone now. Baby, not too long after Otis' sentiment being expressed, suggests going to Mexico as there's no one looking for them there. The one individual who's probably the most not sound of mind, that they didn't even want to let go to the soda machine alone, comes up with the idea that can potentially secure their freedom. Seems a little out of place, but whatever.Once in Mexico, surprise, surprise, trouble follows. A place they'd stated no one was looking for them had people that were - you guessed it - looking for them. Remember when Trejo was killed? His son, the leader of The Black Satans, wants vengeance for Otis having killed his father. Aquarius is tipped off where the three are staying and sends The Black Satans over to handle the job. This would have more than likely ended how Aquarius was hoping if Baby's plot armor didn't kick in by noticing the Satans pointing at her window, giving her a chance to notify her brothers resulting in a head start at surviving the situation.The Black Satans come in and kill pretty much anyone that stands between them and who they're after. After a bunch of innocents die, Baby and Coltrane (Wolfman) are taken hostage themselves while Aquarius offers Otis a chance at saving them via a one on one machete fight, not with Aquarius, but Creep, a very large member of The Black Satans. Otis abides and while we're sitting here wondering what the heck is going on, why the Firefly group is going up against a gang, a cartel, whatever the fricking Satans are, plot armor kicks in again to save the day as a friend Baby has made cuts her and her half-brother free. Things happen the way you'd expect and the movie ends not too long after with the three of them free to do as they please.Even Richard Brake's stellar performance wasn't enough to save this Zombie film, just as it wasn't enough to save 31, leaving him as one of the few, if not only, highlights of the film. I'm not sure if I had more questions before seeing it or afterwards. They get out of prison that easily? Why are we just now hearing about Coltrane even though he's apparently a notorious murder himself? How is Baby going to be insane behind bars noticeable enough to where her brother makes a comment about it, then the second and third act come and she's seemingly sound of mind? Why are we expected to believe that three killers, one of which is completely mentally insane to the point of creating her own reality behind bars, is able to defeat an entire gang in what seems to be less than an hour? This film went off the rails in a way it truly didn't have to. It is understood the Firefly's get up to some crazy shenanigans. It's well known they're dangerous individuals that you do not under any circumstances want to jack with. It's like Rob Zombie decided to construct a cash grab with some of his well known characters, yet had nowhere to go with it, so he decided to write the script as a failed ode to badassery.All in all, this film had all the elements you'd expect from a Firefly movie and followed the same formula (if you will) as its two predecessors before it. There was blood (oh, lord, was there blood), plenty of violence, bad (an understatement) acting on Moon's part, tension, and plenty of memorable lines. We're introduced to the gang again, shown how vicious they are, how insane they are, how ruthless, smart, and evil they are. We got what we knew we were going to get, but this time around it fell flat. Why? Because it was unneeded. The Firefly gang should have been left for dead at the end of Rejects. This was the ending they needed. This was the ending the viewers needed. Instead, what we got was them miraculously surviving a hail of gunfire only to escape from prison and have loads of plot armor they didn't really need.Now having seen it, my only course of action for this movie is to just pretend it doesn't exist. Rob, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Really, really disappointed.3 out of 10.",3 from Hell

Fathom Events Double FeaturePart 2: 3 From Hell on The Big Screen and the 47 People Who Occupied the Other Seats in The Theater Who Were Also Most Certainly From Hell...continued from Part 1: The Devil's Rejects and The Rejects Who Were in The Audience with Me for Both Movies.Holy crap. As I mentioned in Part 1, Fathom Events does NOT mess around. After the absolutely insane audience in the theater through The Devils Rejects, I was anxious to get out of my seat for a few minutes, stretch my legs, take a wizz, go hit my indica pen a few times for some much needed mental relaxation, and while I'm at it get a tub of popcorn. The credits for Devils Rejects ended and most of the theater had cleared out (of course none of them stayed for the credits) just as I am getting up, expecting to have a title card from Fathom saying ""3 From Hell starts in 10 minutes!"" a title card does pop up, but it's literally for 3 From Hell, the actual movie title card. I ask my best friend enduring the madness with me ""is it really starting?"" Sure enough, it was.Fathom has zero chill, when they say double feature, they mean it, they waste ZERO time. No pee breaks, no concession breaks, you're strapped in for 4 hours, no wussy stuff here, you wanted a Rob Zombie double feature here it is mother trucker! You gotta pee? Good thing theater cups are so big, pee in that. It was at any moment I expected chains to be put on the doors. This movie is starting, and no one is in the theater, there are maybe 10 of us, for what is a completely sold out show.It started feeling like Groundhogs Day, as people trickled back in, reminding me of the chaos that happened 90 minutes ago. And somehow, with the exact same crowd, in the exact same seats, people still got back into the wrong seats. I'm sitting there, having to pee, painfully sober, annoyed at everything, trying to watch this movie and I keep hearing ""that's my seat, I'm in E10."" All of this happened once again during the first 20 minutes of the movie. Actually, about five minutes in an actual fight broke out. A seating dispute. A freaking seating dispute. Your seat number is on your ticket! How is this so difficult for people to get? All I heard and in this exact order was ""you bro"", ""this is my seat"", a wet PLOP as a soda fell, BOOSH as a tub of popcorn fell, and a dull, SMACK as someone got punched in the face, than a cacophonous chorus of """" ""psycho!"" ""stop it!"" and ""I can't believe you!"" I couldn't tell what was real and what was in the film. One fat bald man quickly left the theater holding his face, and two fat bearded men followed him, and one of their fat sister's or girlfriend's or moms quickly followed them.""What the heck was that?"" I ask my companion who could only shake his head and laugh. The odd thing is, the theater was never completely full again. About a third of the audience never came back. They paid for both movies, but never returned to see the brand-new sequel. I'm perplexed, I'm writing this the following morning of the actual events and I am still trying to find out if this was a nightmare I had or if this really happened. After a quick text conversation with the friends who joined me last night, this is all very true and they are still as confused as I am.A few minutes after that fight broke out, three staff members from the theater armed with disposable vinyl gloves, a bottle of disinfectant and a roll of paper towels each, stealthily made their way to the area of the fight. Blood had been spilled this night. I sat in disbelief but alas the theater was quiet, and I could finally attempt to watch this movie.It was pretty good.The fact this movie exists is a spoiler, but what I hoped Zombie would do, he halfway did. I wanted to spend more time with the Firefly family and see how 14 years in prison had changed them. For them to go into prison and 1978 and came out in 1992, what effect that would have on these people. As the world changed in a decade and a half, how would they change? Would he delve into the hysteria and love affair news outlets have with gruesome crimes and the evil people that commit them? What commentary would Zombie have? More importantly I wanted to spend time with the madman, Cutter played by Sid Haig.Well he gets killed off early into the film, which on a practical standpoint makes sense. Haig is 80 years old and had an actual life-threatening accident recently. I don't think fully reprising his role as Cutter was possible but even in the few minutes of his screen time, he was captivating and spectacular, and I think a new obsession for Haig has begun to sprout inside my brain. I want to know more about this actor and his prolific catalogue of B, exploitation and critically acclaimed movie career.The rest of the film has some great moments but eventually falls to typical movie plot devices and turns in a well shot, and interesting looking package of something largely unoriginal and overdone.I think Zombie has fantastic characters; his troupe of consistent performers always deliver. Sheri Moon-Zombie as Baby doesn't skip a beat. She's the demented, psycho witch we've seen across Rob's filmography. Only this time, a bit more distant, and unhinged. Deftly observed by her big brother Otis, played again by Bill Moseley. Otis has shown real growth and changed. 14 years in solitary has relaxed him. Still strong, still terrifying but able to slow down and take a look around. The newcomer to the group is their half-brother Winslow Foxworth Coltrane, also affectionately referred to as ""The Midnight Wolfman"" played by Richard Brake of Batman Begins and Game of Thrones fame. Aside from a few lines in Batman and a completely silent performance in GoT, I haven't really seen what this guy can do. Turns out he doesn't disappoint. Foxy, feels like he belongs, and Brakes performance gives us some of the edge Otis has lost over the past decade and a half in the can. The only disappointing aspect of the new character is the ""Wolfman""aspect. With a handle that cool, I was really hoping we'd delve into how he got that nickname and what kind of gruesome acts he commits to keep it. Sadly, we get a few goofy howls in certain scenes but that's it. More bark than bite.Like The Devil's Rejects, 3 From Hell has a captivating visual style, an excellently edited film, creative uses of frame rates and slow motion, but ultimately that isn't enough to keep me hooked. The story and dialogue just never go anywhere challenging or stimulating or original enough for me to give a damn. And I really want to give a damn.Zombie is a smart guy, I love his insight and calm, soft spoken demeanor. Watch his interviews, he's fantastic. He's a thinker, he's obsessed with all things film and talks about them with loving, genuine, knowledge. If he never had a music or movie career, he'd make an excellent critic or film teacher. It's painful that only some of that shows in this film. I like these characters, I want to see them do things just not the same exact things I saw them do in the last movie: drive around, lose cops and spend large amounts of time in hotel rooms. The dialogue just isn't strong enough for that kind of movie.Ultimately, I did enjoy 3 From Hell, but I would rate this on the lower side of the scale. Hardcore fans will get their fill, the rest of us will keep our fingers crossed in anticipation for Zombie's best film, which I believe is still ahead of him.",3 from Hell

It was hard to be sympathetic to the baby character, because she was allowed to be too over the top with a pinch of arrogance.

When midnight screenings and double features were a haven and the internet was just a myth in a Gibson novel. Everyone these days is spoiled by an over-saturation of quality entertainment. I get it... But I also remember reveling in Dawn of the Dead and Toxic Avenger and I Spit and Last House... So I reject your youthful assessment of something you barely understand.Zombie has done something special with 3 From Hell. It's half a dozen movies in one, and they all work together, and it's awesome. It's a 70s true crime doc, it's a prison movie, it's a WOMEN'S prison movie, it's a home invasion movie, then last but not least, it's a WESTERN!What's not to love here? I honestly don't understand. We've got Otis, doing his thing. We've got the new family member, the Midnight Wolfman, played perfectly by Richard Brake... and we've got the captivating Sheri Moon Zombie as Baby, even more warped and twisted by years of solitary confinement.This is exploitation at it's finest. It's a sick and twisted time machine that shows us a glimpse of a time when opinions didn't dictate art.",3 from Hell
129,catimeup,zombie's worst movie,1,4 November 2019,"For a horror movie this felt almost too campy. throughout the whole movie you more or less got the sense that the trio would be alive and well in the end.
The plot wasn't a whole lot different from the others in the trilogy, but you got the notion that the film was made merely for those who wanted to see the original trio for one last movie. It would have been much better if there was a better plot, and more thought was put into script and general direction of the film. Granted they had to work around captain Spaulding not being healthy to finish the movie so reworking had to be redone, but it felt rushed and thoughtless. I really wanted to enjoy this movie",3 from Hell
130,NeverBeTheOneToBlindlyFollow,Loved it!,9,19 October 2019,I wasn't disappointed in the least. The only downfall is the lack of Captain Spaulding but we all know why he isn't in here that much. So it is obviously forgiven and I'm thankful we got the time that we did with him on screen.Having said that I really don't understand the hate it's getting. My nephew and I loved it! It gave me everything I hoped for. It has the characters we know and love and doesn't fail on the execution of the personalities. And the new character we get fits in like a glove. He is defiantly family because he is as messed up as they are and I love every second of it. Avoid the harsh reviews on this one. It's so much better then it's being received.I'd love another one. Tho I'd be happy to have this as the seal on a solid horror trilogy.,3 from Hell
131,onionbagel,Well worth the wait!,8,17 September 2019,"I'm gonna keep this pretty short, sweet and to-the-point (MILD spoilers ahead). I (like many people) was very skeptical of this movie for a few reasons:
1. It's been 14 years since The Devil's Rejects!
2. Rob could never make a movie more disturbing than T.D.R.
3. Rob could also never top the ending of T.D.R.With all that being said, I was NOT disappointed! I think Rob knew he couldn't one-up any aspect of T.D.R., so rather than try to (which wouldn't have worked) he just continued the story.3 From Hell picks up right where T.D.R. left off (and Rob even took the 14 year gap into consideration when writing the script) and this is where my only complaint with the movie lies: we are just briefly told how each Reject was shot 20 times and they have a 1:1,000,000 chance of survival, BUT no explanation as to how they survived is really given; however, you can infer by the ""Satanic Recovery"" newspaper headline, that the Devil kept them alive to continue doing His work.I know a lot of people are upset that Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) only has a few minutes of screen time, but (in case you didn't know) Haig has been in and out of the hospital in real life, so Rob decided to kill his character off early and bring in Richard Brake (31's Doom-head) to round out the ""3"" From Hell.Not only was Brake a great addition as Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) and Otis' (Bill Mosely) half-brother, but Baby was AMAZING in this movie! She was back and crazier than ever (this trilogy is a prime example of how great she'd be as Harley Quinn) and Otis was his usual crazy/satanic/leader self.To wrap this up: 3.F.H. wasn't as campy as House of 1000 Corpses, nor was it as sadistic as T.D.R.; it was a nice in-between and a nice ending to a great trilogy by Mr. Zombie!",3 from Hell

I am a huge fan of house of 1000 corpses i watch that movie a few times a year and love it everytime, devils rejects was ok and iv watched it a few times but this was just awful. theres nothing here. I dont understand why he removed all the best aspects of the 1st film and filled the last 2 with typical dime a dozen slasher bs. Its been done to death and we dont need more its just like remaking haloween theres no need for it. Mr zombie needs to go back and watch house and really look at what made that film great sure the music and slo mo shots were cool but the meat of it was dr satan, the fireflys home, the comedy of the captain, and the look of otis.

135,continual-one,Of course I wanted to love this movie...,5,17 September 2019,"I guess you just can't go back and re-capture that magic and honesty of House of 1,000 Corpses and the superior The Devil's Rejects. I give kudos to Rob for giving it a go but this movie just plain fell flat. All the ingredients were there...Gore, blood, guts, filth, profanity, humor, revenge. I just was not able to get excited scared or involved with the film. It wasn't slow, it was just meh. Granted, I have never been a fan of Sheri Moon and I think she has taken every movie down a notch or two that Rob insists on including her in. Verily, her scenes are like some sort of music video with her prancing around all ""evil"" and cutesy in slow motion. She's clearly the centerpiece here and that's a shame because Bill Moseley is the king of horror and although he does his best with the material at hand, he can't salvage the script and the overall ""story"". New guy, Richard Brake the ""brother in law"" does a decent job filling the gap left by Sid Haig (who does have a brief appearance in the film), but it all feels very forced and lacks overall conviction. It's just ""meh"" and I really wanted it to be Rejects part 2.I realize we aren't dissecting the works of Shakespeare here. It's a Rob Zombie horror film. Those that love everything he does, will love it. I personally think he got it right with House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, but ever since then...he's been trying to recapture that glory and has failed to do so.",3 from Hell

I though finally another rob zombie movie to get him out of the hole of disappointment from lords of Salem. When I first saw the movie I didn't realize captain Spaulding was only in the movie for 3 minutes. That's was very disappointing, I know Sid Haig was sick but I would of scrapped movie without him. Over all it was an ok movie alittle two fast pace for me. Seems to be a lot of gaps in it. Maybe that's how it was filmed. But over all it seemed to have no real plot, when the movie ended I thought to myself what was the point of this movie.",3 from Hell
139,pompeyjoanne,Not sure why so many haters,10,7 October 2019,"Having read some of the reviews on here, I thought I would hate this movie, but I didn't. It's very much along the same vein as the other 2 and I enjoyed it. It didn't have quite the shock value of the others, but that because they were so shocking! The introduction of a newbie character Winslow makes sense as Sid was unwell and older and he fills the gap. I'm not sure what people were expecting when they went to see this who then say it's rubbish. It was another chapter in the Firefly family chaotic and horrific story. I'm giving it a ten because I gave the other 2 the same and for me, this film delivered more of the same. I guess haters gonna hate.....",3 from Hell
140,danthayer,Dear Rob: please stop,1,18 February 2020,"Just awful. Rob is an OK director, but his scripts are just terrible. The script for this particular movie made me cringe myself inside out. Rob should start directing other people's scripts or just stop. Ideally the latter.",3 from Hell
141,eeluksw,Truly A Hellish Experience,1,16 October 2019,"The well had already dried up fourteen years ago when The Devil's Rejects sent everyone's sorry behind out in a hail of gunfire, so to return after so long, with less resources, less commercial enthusiasm, and even less ideas tells us that it's not just Hollywood that's scraping the bottom of the barrel.It's a tale of two movies, neither of which fit together, nor are they worthy of the continued exploits of the surviving Firefly clan. The first part is a meandering hangout film while the second seeks to distract you by being some kind of Fear And Loathing In Mexico while it grasps wildly for an antagonist behind the curtain. Put the two together and you've got an overlong movie with nothing to say and no consequences to bear on its characters.The only thing I like about it is how easily Bill Moseley slips back into being Otis. He gets all the best screen time in this movie. Each time Zombie accidentally writes some decent dialogue it's usually Otis's. I don't know what he did to Baby, but boy, all I can do is give credit to Sherri Moon Zombie for trying. Even she gets tired of the crazy shtick and gives up on it halfway through.It's not funny, not amusing, looks like poop, the camerawork nauseatingly shaken, and overall not a good time. I'll leave with this: in the behind the scenes featurette shown after the film, Zombie describes how he doesn't want to do sequels unless the idea is right. Regurgitating catch phrases and all that may be good on opening night, giving your fans what they want, ""...until a month later you realize, man, that movie's just a hollow piece of sh_t.""",3 from Hell

144,JRodFilms,3 From Hell (2019),4,22 November 2019,"""3 From Hell"" is a sequel to both The Devils Rejects and House of 1000 Corpses.So let me get my rating right out of the way I gave it a 4 out of 10 or a solid 2 stars. While I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would, I didn't love it either and out of the 3 films, this has to be at the bottom of the list. The whole movie felt like The Best of Rob Zombie films: a little bit of Corpses, mixed with some Rejects, sprinkle a little Halloween, and you get 3 From Hell.The movie has a rough start in the beginning and comes across somewhat amateurish and low budget, so if you were expecting something exciting and action packed like the farmhouse shootout from the opening of The Devils Rejects, you will be disappointed . The film opens with grainy and ugly newsreel footage complete with narration, as it replays some of the final scene from The Devils Rejects just before the trio get into the highway shootout with the cops. The film skips over the shootout and we find them arrested and jail, followed by a quick trial and news clippings which show the trio are found guilty. Around this time is when we see Sid Haig's only scene as Captain Spaulding, where he reprises his famous line 'Do I Stutter' and then is shipped off to be executed using lethal injection.For those who can't stand Sherri Moon be prep red because essentially this is her movie. Sherri Moon pulls out all the stops in this film, and her character Baby is presented here more on the side of the crazy feel she has in 1000 Corpses than that of the laid back feel she has in Rejects. In this film Baby is presented as extremely unstable, she hallucinates about cats, she purrs like a cat, teeters on the fence of lesbianism, and can't make parole. Only during a scene in which she challenges some hombres to a knife throwing contest does Sheri Moon display Baby in the chilled out relaxed character like she does in the Rejects. However like I said, she is very unstable in the film and is essentially a killing machine and has the best kill in the movie, which I won't spoil, because it is indeed a nasty scene.Let me talk about Otis' escape from jail which not only is it lazy and entirely too abrupt, but it sets up the failure for the rest of the film. Otis and Rondo, who is played by Danny Trejo are in the same prison and end up on a work truck together. Otis recognizes Rondo and says 'I remember you', to which Rondo says, 'I don't remember you' and Otis says 'You will #x27; and ends up shooting and killing him. Fast forward to when the trio decide to escape to Mexico, it takes absolutely no time for someone to recognize the Fireflys and snitch to Rondos brother, who will exact revenge on the trio with his army team of luchador shooters called The Black Satans.In order for the film to work, there needed to be more time to find out more about Rondo and how he ends up in prison next to Otis. The escapes needed to be written better because Otis escapes first and him and his half brother Foxy end up in a house torturing a few people, while Baby plays a fine line between being a lesbian and a psychotic killer in jail. Entirely too much time is spent with Baby and even after she escapes, they are cooped up in a motel room and nothing is happening to the point where Foxy says something along the lines of, Whats the plan, We need to move this along.3 from Hell is essentially beat by beat, a re hash of The Devils Rejects. But what is missing is purpose. In The Devils Rejects, Wydell has a vendetta against the Fireflys for killing his brother in 1000 Corpses. We don't get purpose in this film. If there was more backstory on Rondo and his brother, we could've cared a bit more and related to his brother and his revenge on the Fireflies . Instead this movie is basically Sheri Moon's highlight reel as she is given top billing at the end credits, Otis seems bored and his dialogue is lazy which just rehashes lines and gags from the other two films. The one thing I enjoyed is the music which is more along the lines of the songs found in Rejects and the score is a bit more synth-y like 1000 Corpses.All in all, the film seems like a DVD extra, or a fan made film. It holds absolutely no purpose and now keeps the story of the Fireflies open. See it if you love Zombie and love the Fireflies, but just be aware that this is not better then The Devils Rejects.",3 from Hell
145,odead82,A pointless entry that never should of been made,3,19 October 2019,"I understand that Sid Haig was in failing health and most of the script had to be changed due to that fact. I can only imagine the film we might have seen given different circumstances. That being said this film was bad from the very beginning. Explaining away the Firflys death in TDR final moments with a fast montage was in poor taste. Having Capt. Spaulding survive all that, in a nonsensical way only to have 5 minutes of screen time was just dumb. What this film could of been even after the changes were made was not what we got. Instead it's a rehash of the last film and most of it is unnecessary filler that doesn't fit in a story that should be much larger. All attempts at making this work fall short, the actors were great once again given the script they had to work with but this film feels so out of touch. Seriously a random clown shows up at the door for no reason other than..... your guess is as good as mine. It's a slow film and yet feels very rushed to the end. Missed opportunities and bad dialogue don't help. The movie is a mess and I wanted to love it and some parts I did but not enough to watch it ever again. The Firefly family died on that strip of road at the end of The Devils Rejects, I was good with that ending then and I'm even better with it now.",3 from Hell

Rob combined the brutality, and grittiness of Rejects, with the wacky, Retro stylish throwback of Corpses and thus summoned 3 From Hell.If you enjoy self-aware, brutal, grindhouse, action horror then you will love this addition.

149,beornmatt,Tired rehash of a fantastic movie,3,17 September 2019,"I really enjoyed The Devil's Rejects, but this was just a tired rehash. It follows the obligatory formula: setup that establishes how crazy people are, a group of people taken hostage and murdered, the Firefly family running away and then getting betrayed by someone, then a lot of shooting. There's lots of naked women and the trademark kaleidoscope scene that has unfortunately become Rob Zombie's trademark. Sherri Moon Zombie tries to play crazy but comes of as ridiculously annoying, while the rest of the ensemble is lackluster. The script was atrocious; the lines that were supposed to convey the most gravitas were laughably bad, so much so that the person behind me asked her companion if this was supposed to be horror or a comedy. The sole high point was the soundtrack - it was really, really well-done and complimented the movie perfectly.Final verdict: don't be in a hurry to pay to see this, even when it releases on digital.

And then..it seemed as if our wish was coming true! Rumors swirled for ages until finally... the teaser trailer was released... and finally: we got one more movie with all three of The Devil's Rejects.... What more did you people expect!? This film gave us EVERYTHING we love about the Firefly saga! Beautiful visuals, amazing music, bewbs, and enough mf'ers to fill the Grand Canyon, it was fantastic!!!

Everyone is to old and sheri moon's acting is predictable and becomes grating almost immedietly. Sid Haig was a big personality of the series and his short camera time is defintelely noticed.Espcially considering he is the most popular character of the bunch...I appreciate his efforts and thinking about the demand of his fans.....but this should have never been made so late in everyone's career, this franchise should have started in the mid 90's ha",3 from Hell

Sheri Moon Zombie turns in an award-winning performance.Captain Spaulding is my favorite character and it's so sad he's barely in it and then they execute him at the start of the movie. His one-liners are comedy gold and were sorely missed. Lots of actors from 31 are in this. There's lots of Rejects rehash here. Torturing and killing innocent people in a room. Otis saying he's the Devil, yadda yadda yadda.The computer graphics gore is distracting. I wish Zombie had tied it more to the previous two movies. Baby mentions Tiny, but, that's about it. A scene between Baby and a ghost/dream of Mother Firefly would've been nice.The ending was very unsatisfying for wrapping up a trilogy.

181,peterrifkin,He´s done it again,1,7 October 2019,"Mr. Zombie has really done it again. Made a film casting his very mediocre actor wife in the lead. This woman is as bad actor as she is annoying and over-acting.
Its really irritating that he does this time and time over again. The stories are actually good, or okay, but casting his wife like they have some kinda marriage-deal that she has to play in every movie of his. And this reflexes his ability to direct. And ill give him that. Composision and directing action and stuff like that he knows well.
BUT he should take som kinda acting class to learn how to direct actors, are at least know what a good actor is. And a good actor is not just screaming and cussing in every sentence. And its NOT cool or funny. Well, maybe funny for all the wrong reasons. Almost pathetic and childish.
And people can say what they want that ""Baby"" is supposed to be like a child sometimes, but overacting is not the solution.

188,onesixtyreviews,Film Review: 3 From Hell,4,11 October 2019,"Rob Zombie returns to the characters that first gave him true fame as a director: the Firefly family. It's been 14 years since we last saw the Rejects in what was, in my opinion, the best film of his career 2005's The Devil's Rejects. So is the third entry in this series worth checking out?Well yes and no.There is a lot to love for Zombie fans. Bill Moseley is once again the highlight as Otis B. Driftwood. He is having a ball in this role and is always the most interesting part of the film.The addition of Richard Brake as younger brother Winslow is a solid addition to fill the void left by Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding. Haig does appear in the film for a short time and was nice having a last moment to honour his recent passing.Sheri Moon Zombie's performance as Baby Firefly, however, is a mixed bag. She isn't a very strong actor, never has been, but she obviously loves this character and puts her all into it.The movie is split into two halves. The first half follows where the characters ended up after the events of Devil's Rejects and how they came to reunite over the span of a decade. While the second half is the Firefly family's past catching up to them.The first half is the weakest as it moves really slowly and the story struggles to get going. The second half, however, is a lot stronger. More fun and and feels like The Devil's Rejects but more light hearted.Overall I don't think this film needs to exist. It doesn't add anything new or interesting to justify its existence. Seems to just be Zombie wanting to reunite with old friends and have some fun with them.The Devil's Rejects ended on such a perfect note I can't really understand the exact reason to do this film. It feels as though this film is mainly for hardcore Rob Zombie fans.Not as good as The Devil's Rejects but far better than House of 1000 Corpses:2 Stars",3 from Hell
189,miguel-rocks,I kind of liked it,6,19 October 2019,"The devils rejects its a perfect movie for me , it was awesome it had everything, but this one was missing it , it started kind of good , but it was all over the place , missing the plot , there were some good scenes , but I did not liked the end at all , but it was nice to make it a trilogy , hope he learns from the mistakes and try's to go for the 4 one",3 from Hell
190,zach-davis-zd,"This movie could have been great, but....",4,18 September 2019,"If you are like me, you probably thought that the ending to The Devils Rejects was incredible, almost majestic. TDR was one of the best horror movies at the time and was a great equal. With that said, 3 From Hell was not. If you are someone that just watched House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects for the first time recently, you might enjoy 3 From Hell. If you have been waiting the 14 years for this movie, it will be a let down. Zombie ended TDR on an incredible note, so having those 14 years to plan out another return of the Firefly family, you would think it would be something unique and unexpected. It wasn't. Your explanation to it was 'odds of their survival are 1,000,000 to 1. They survived'. That's it. I'll put that aside for now. The movie also felt like it was missing a solid plot, but maybe that is what Zombie was going for. The last thing that kind of annoyed me about this movie was 2 scenes. I won't spoil them, but it has almost exactly the same feel as the Hotel scene and the strip club scene in TDR. Overall, it had so much potential and could have been a great movie, but it just failed to hit that level. Worth the 2 hours and $15, but The Devils Rejects will still be Zombies best work in my opinion.",3 from Hell
191,CruorEnthusiast25,More stupidity. Less charm.,4,29 September 2020,"This is the first film of the franchise I disliked. The first two were great horror films, and I particularly like House of 1000 Corpses. I know most people prefer Devil's Rejects, but House of 1000 Corpses will always be my favourite. I loved the characters (more specifically the bad guys), the surreal, sometimes outright bizarre editing, and the black comedy tone. The movie was a little stupid, but in a way that was charming. Like it was enjoyable to watch something that didn't require your brain to be switched on 100%. 3 from Hell, however, was basically even more stupidity but minus the charm.Probably the worst aspect of the film was the production value. This movie cost only $3 million to make and it certainly shows. Basically, even if you go into this movie expecting to see mindless gore for mindless gore's sake, you'll still be disappointed. There was honestly not a single murder in this film that I enjoyed. A lot of kills occur at least partially off-screen, and when you do see the murders or aftermath, it's usually a gunshot-wound to the head with blatant CGI blood. I'm sorry, but in 2019 (or 2020, when I watched 3 from Hell and am writing this review), I think the horror community isn't going to squirm much at gunshot wounds, much less gunshot wounds that look utterly fake. The previous film featured a woman have her boyfriend's face put on her as a mask, for heaven's sake!Then there's the editing. If you like pointless and over-used slow-motion that serves no clear artistic purpose, then this is the film for you. If you like random cuts to things that we've already seen in the movie, then this is the film for you. If you like a potentially cool prison fight/murder being made entirely of freeze-frames, you're in luck. Another reason I disliked the kills is because probably half are in slow-motion for no reason. Adds to the cheapness, big time.The pacing is another woe of mine. This film didn't feel like it had enough content for 90 minutes, much less 115. What's the point of making the film longer just to stretch it out with filler and slow-motion? 'Boring' is the last word that should accurately describe a movie like this, but this movie is just that.This movie seems to forget about halfway through that the Firefly's are the bad guys, as there's a whole plot of them going to Mexico and becoming friends with these local people. Then there's a group of Mexican gangsters who come gunning for them, leading to a cringe-worthy showdown riddled with the aforementioned CGI blood and slow-motion.The acting isn't great. Bill Moseley and Richard Brake did decent jobs, although with a better script it could have been significantly better. I'm sorry, but Sheri Moon Zombie is just over-the-top and cringeworthy in this film. Especially the parts when she's in prison. In fairness, she only can do as well as the script allows, also. But that doesn't change the fact that her scenes made me kind of think  to myself. Also, what the heck was the deal with that dream sequence/ hallucination of the dancing animal in her cell? Bizarre, and not in the normal Rob Zombie way.The soundtrack was not good. The music itself is very good, but feels totally tone-deaf for this movie. A lot of happy-sounding 70's music that feels out-of-place in a world of gore and mayhem.This movie goes nowhere. It accomplishes nothing. At the end of the film, the Firefly's just go out into the wilderness, and there was not point to anything. They gave them a contrived resurrection just for this? Come on.In conclusion, this movie is poor. I went in expecting it could be not great, but I was still surprised at how bad it was. Perhaps worse yet, the film isn't even so-bad-it's-good. It feels painfully middle-of-the-road, which can be worse sometimes. Overall, not recommended. 4/10 stars.",3 from Hell
192,punksamurai1985,Started off Okay,5,17 June 2020,"Literally once the mid point hits stupidity takes over, characters would do things no remotely intelligent or well thought out character would ever do and then it turns into every other Rob Zombie movie including carnage over obscure 70's music. Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm done officially with Zombie movies, he's producing cookies not movies",3 from Hell
193,tomanc,"Not the Bloodbath we expected. A Gentler, more mellow Zombie effort",8,18 September 2019,"This movie was a lot different than I expected. The tone, overall, is a lot more subdued then House of 1,000 Corpses or Devil's Rejects.
This movie does continue the story of the Firefly family, but not really, because the plot basically repeats the outline of Devil's Rejects: They're on the run, they hole up and terrorize a family (and then kill them), they go somewhere to party, they get ratted on, there's a battle, they kill their pursuers, they drive away. What the movie really is, is paying a visit to some great characters we haven't seen in a while. It gives them a new life, it gives Otis the start of his endgame as he starts to feel his age, it gives Baby a new soul, and it gives them new family in the form of half-brother Winslow Coltrane.
Though it repeats story beats from Devil's Rejects, it's still a different movie. 3 From Hell is quieter, more mellow, and the characters are a little less intense (except Sheri as Baby, who is next level). Otis, who in the previous films was the engine that drove the murderous family, really is tired and ready to settle down. His overt malevolence is largely replaced with more of a sense of fatigue. Even when basically duplicating his hotel room massacre from Devil's Rejects, Otis is just going through the motions (the character, not the actor).
Richard Brake, one of the scariest (but somehow extremely charming) actors in film is not as maniacal as I had expected he'd be. His character Winslow is really rather amiable. We know that Otis and Baby are sad about losing their brothers Tiny and Rufus, so once Brake's Winslow was introduced, I was hoping to see some good bonding and character development. That gets skimmed over pretty quickly. I really wanted to get more Winslow in general, including his backstory.
In a lot of RZ's movies, he brings in great character actors and gives them a chance to shine, but just as often they only show up for a couple of minutes a piece. Sid Haig and Danny Trejo both get very little screen time this time. I was excited for both of them, but Sid's scene in the beginning is basically what you see on the trailer. I think that his interview should have been longer. At least he got a scene of his own, though. The brevity of Danny Trejo's appearance, and not giving his character Rondo anything to do, is unforgivable.
And then there's Clint Howard. I have never seen such a waste of a perfectly good Clint Howard. Clint Howard as a clown in a Rob Zombie movie basically writes itself, but no one remembered to write it.
Clint Howard's appearance as a clown who took a wrong turn occurs in the middle of a larger scene that also doesn't work, the home hostage scene. This scene that I've mentioned before is really just a rerun of the motel scene in Devil's Rejects. That scene only worked once. I know the goal was to coerce the warden into sneaking Baby out of prison, but it was redundant and unsurprising, and given the change in Otis's demeanor, it didn't really fit. I wish they'd gone a different route for coercing the warden, Jeff Daniel Phillips, another actor whose character I wanted to see more of.
The part of the movie that worked the best and is its saving grace was Sheri Moon Zombie's performance as Baby. She's wonderful in the first two movies, but in this one she is next-level amazing, so far out there that she seems more like a hallucinatory CGI effect in human form. She brings an amazing energy to this film.
In House of 1000 Corpses, everyone was amazing, and overall Sid Haig stole the show. In Devil's Rejects it was Bill Moseley as Otis who lit up the screen and you couldn't take your eyes off of him. Here in 3 From Hell, it's Sheri as Baby who brings the fireworks. This really is her movie.",3 from Hell
194,jhcbarker-87931,This could have been a much better film.,4,19 October 2019,"I think all fans of the first two films have already imagined what the third installment could have been like. But what we got was a predictable and self indulgent film that fails to hit the mark.
Yes, it has some great dialogue between characters and a healthy amount of carnage to keep most movie goers happy. However, it feels like its the same film regurgitated.
Act one; escape in a fire fight.
Act two; insert dialogue to make the central characters likeable.
Act three; create tension where it seems that the central characters can not escape....
Then have a final fight and ride off into the sunset.

I was Highly anticipating this film which was a huge let down. The plot is, close up and slow motion of Sheri, nothing happens, more Sheri, even more Sheri, weird jump forwards and backwards confusing the viewer as to what is going on, random stuff happening that makes no sense, nothing happens, Sheri gets even more annoying, some blood and more of nothing happening, movie over. I have never been a fan of Sheri but this was by far was her worst role. I really wish Rob would quit shoving her down all our throats in every movie he makes. She has zero talent and her annoying voice and over the top performances all come off as fake. Richard Brake was really good but I feel Rob should of used his talent more in this film. More focus on Richard and way less on Sheri. Bill Moseley wasn't bad but he seemed really bored throughout. Most of the film you can tell the actors are well, acting. The film feels like it was thrown together in a matter of weeks. It felt like most of the actors had zero passion for the parts they were playing. I wouldn't say skip this one because you should make up your own mind, but don't go in with high expectations. You may enjoy it, you may not.",3 from Hell

200,C_J_Lister,3 From Hell,7,18 March 2020,"Enjoyable but also rather timid film compared to other Rob Zombie films. It's the third instalment in House of 1000 Corpses franchise, and I can't help but feel this movie doesn't need to exist; the first two films were brilliant, and one of the biggest reason for that was down to Sid Haig, and although he has a cameo in this film he isn't in it movie long. I understand this was due to his ill health. But you feel his absence throughout the movie. However, Richard Brake does a brilliant job and is an excellent addition to the cast. I have yet to see a lousy performance from Richard Brake. But it's not just Richard the entire cast are brilliant in this movie, and all turn in excellent performances. I'm a fan of Sheri Moon Zombie, and she's brilliant in this movie. I wish she did more movies than just her husbands.I enjoyed the first act, which contained some rather compelling editing choices. The rest of the movie, although it had its moments, felt rather unambitious and seemed to go through the motions at times.If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, then this is a must-see. If you're not a fan and are looking to be convinced by this movie, then this probably isn't going to change your mind.

Watching those actors actually doing a decent acting job and follow exotic weird gory events without any background or any vague sense of reality is just pain and cringy as hell.

205,DiamondOzMU,"Not Rob Zombie's worst, but not a worthy sequel to his best",5,2 June 2020,"When I was a kid, I used to write stories for fun. At about eight, I decided to write a ""story for grown ups"" which meant I loaded it with swear words. My dad might not have been impressed, but evidently Rob Zombie was because he seems to have adapted it into 3 From Hell.This film has been getting a lot of flack from fans and critics which is not undeserved, however it might be a little better than suggested.To use the bad news/good news tactic, I'll start with the problems. Immediately, the writing sticks out. This may in fact have the worst dialogue of any movie I've seen, at least in recent years. It consists mostly of MF in every other sentence, including the news segments and while I don't have a problem with swearing, especially in a grizzly horror film, you have to know how to use it. There's a difference between people who sound cool doing it and an eight year old thinking it's clever. Secondly, the character of Baby has been ruined. While she's always been over the top, there was at least an understanding of the craziness and troubles of her psyche, whereas this time, she's almost always shrieking and is boiled down to a one dimensional parody of her former self. As for the plot, it borrows heavily from The Devil's Rejects, only with none of the nuance or intricacies. Add a little Texas Chainsaw Massacre ending and even a bit of Natural Born Killers and what you have is an unoriginal slog, with very little to invest in.It's not all bad however. Unlike some of Rob Zombie's other films, there's at least a cohesive plot, even if, as previously stated, it's not very good. Setting the final part in Mexico was an interesting idea, even if the design was all wrong and it felt like a rehash of TDR, where in the main characters visit Ken Foree's place. The Mexican gang looked kind of cool, even if the motivation felt tacked on and they named themselves after parody metal band The Black Satans. Bill Moseley can still pull off Otis, even if not as endearing as the previous outing and Richard Brake is a fantastic addition, who has always been reliable for good performances. Even his brief scene in Mandy made him stand out. I also thoroughly enjoyed Pancho Moler, who played perhaps the only character with an ounce of humanity.Overall, it's watchable, but annoying. The magic of The Devil's Rejects was that three despicable people became not just likeable, but human, despite their gruesome actions. In this, most of the characters are either pastiches, clichés or at best, bad cartoon characters.What started out as a promising new career for Rob Zombie has spiraled into an embarrassing one. From The Haunted World Of El Superbeasto onwards, his films have been messy, poorly written, weak attempts to follow in the steps of directors he clearly he enjoys and while I do rate 3 From Hell higher than 31 and much higher than The Lords Of Salem, it's hardly a triumphant return to form. Considering Lionsgate apparently planned to shut down the film if Sid Haig wasn't in it, it seems like studios are beginning to lose faith in him too. If accomplished film makers like Jon Waters and John Carpenter have had a lot of trouble with securing funding for their projects, then I expect it won't be long until Rob Zombie does find himself in the company of revered directors, only not in the way he'd want.",3 from Hell

225,juicebox07,"Not for the masses, but die hards will love it.",10,15 October 2019,"I have seen every Rob Zombie film, and there's something about his style that keeps me coming back for more. He has released some less than stellar films, like 31, but I definitely feel he made a nice comeback with this one. His films featuring the Firefly family are his raison d'etre basically. The Devil's Rejects was such a strong film that I don't think anything he ever does will top that, but he did what he could with this one. This is definitely not a film for the mainstream masses, but I think die hard fans of Zombie's movies will enjoy this.Captain Spaulding/Sid Haig was meant to continue his character arc in this one as part of the ""three from hell"", but unfortunately just weeks before shooting, he became too ill to work. Rob was able to get him cleared for just one day of shooting to at least have him in one scene in the movie. Rob had to completely re-write the script right before they were to start shooting, so considering the circumstances, I still think he did a great job.Enter Richard Brake as Foxy. He is the new character that will fill the Captain's shoes. Now, he's no Spaulding, nor is he as interesting as the other two characters. Still, I enjoyed having a new character and getting to meet yet another member of the Firefly clan. It was actually kind of funny watching him try to fit in with his sadistic half-siblings. His crimes (prior to this movie) were ""two bit crimes"", as Otis states. You can tell he's trying to compete with, but also impress, Otis throughout the film. The film even jokes about him being somewhat of an outsider when Baby and Otis refer to themselves as ""the two of us"" and Foxy says, ""What am I f------ invisible?""Otis is still pretty much the same character in this one as he was in Rejects. Baby, however, has changed pretty drastically. After years of solitary confinement, she has gone totally crazy. She speaks nonsense and even hallucinates. While I appreciate what Rob was going for, I do think this was a bit over the top at times.Thankfully it becomes a bit toned down as the movie goes on. She really does become the star in the second half.This film is nothing like House of 1000 Corpses, but it is quite similar to the Devil's Rejects, while still maintaining its own vibe. Some people have been complaining that it's too much like Rejects, but if it had been totally different, they would be complaining about that too. You just can't win with some people. Personally, I think this was a great follow up. It was extremely fun seeing the Firefly clan back in action and causing destruction. I didn't want the film to end and it leaves me wanting even more.",3 from Hell

This sequel says absolutely nothing. It is as unnecessary as it is stupid. Well, movies like Halloween, Child's Play and Friday the 13th have numerous unnecessary sequels so what's the difference? The firefly family are humans. Humans die. Specially after being shot 20 times. It was a fine ending to Devil's Rejects and should've been left alone. Well, for some unexplained reason they're back to do absolutely nothing. Zombie has no idea what to do with the characters or the story. He undid everything he accomplished in Devil's by stripping these amazing characters of their purpose and turning them into pointless, unimportant killing machines. I felt such a connection to them on Devil's and this time around I couldn't care less what happened to them, I just wanted this whole thing to be over.

First of all Sid Haig is in it for about 10mins, ok I know he was ill at the time of shooting, but the film studio wouldn't of even let Zombie release this steaming pile in the first place if he wasn't even in it. Danny Treo who is quite a regular in Zombie's films is also in it for about 5mins (if that) and you can tell he couldn't even afford to have him in it for too long otherwise it would've sucked out most of his budget (even for a B movie star like Treo is these days). And lastly, it was a straight to DVD release which actually suprised some fans? I mean, what did they actually expect when somehow Zombie's films just keep getting worse instead of better?Rob Zombie's films have always been trash, let's face it but the guy just cannot help himself and continues to make the same old mess. Profanity every few minutes, rednecks who like to kill people and ripping off Tobe Hooper and sometimes Stanley Kubrick every chance he can get. Personally I think somebody should just sit him down and tell him to stop but he obviously has too many yes men (and his wife) around him telling him what he's doing is worth releasing.I don't recommended this, or any of his other films whatsoever and I think he really needs to just stick to his music, which isn't even all that better to be honest.

Where I didn't really care for 1000 Corpses (3/5) but I did enjoy The Devil's Rejects (4/5). The 3 started out interesting, I was indeed curious on how Rob was going to continue the story but it ended in feeling like a very unneeded edition to the trilogy. Sheri Moon Zombie's Baby and Bill Moseley's Otis Driftwood were great but without the late Sig Haig's Captain Spaulding for most of the whole film, felt empty. I completely understand why Rob had to write Spaulding out due to Sig's health but replacing him didn't fit well. Nothing against Richard Brake I like him as an actor especially as Doom-Head in 31 but I felt like the film would have been much better with Spaulding, without him I felt like the movie shouldn't have even been made. I will add this film had some fun moments and a decent soundtrack but with some poor special effects and a lackluster ending, I felt that The Devil's Rejects should have been a proper ending for the Firefly family.

With several that he made there is no point of comparison with this. Easily this movie could last 40 minutes but almost lasts two hours. I don't pretend to be negative but Rob Zombie is more than this. I like how Sheri Moon acts and I think that with the material she had she did the best she could. This is like a bad action movie with extra blood. And it hurts to say so because Rob seems to be very satisfied promoting it on his social media with his wife.

256,farslayer-35385,A joke of a movie,3,8 December 2019,"Well Rob Zombie has done it again: another joke of a movie. So our synopsis is that our Devil's Rejects survived the massive amount of gunshot wounds they received in the previous film. As unbelievable as this premise is, it's actually the most believable part of the movie. We're supposed to pretend that officials and law enforcement have no ability whatsoever to handle what would be a potential series of actions these three would take in their revenge on their captors. They can apparently kill entire mobs of heavily armed men with low quality weapons and that said mob enjoys sending their people in one at a time instead of en masse. Basically, they're super-powered and ultra-skilled killers who are totally invincible and have super-luck at all times. It's horrible. I mean I can suspend all belief for some movies, but for this movie there are only a few actions taken by the characters which would even seem the remote-bit believable. There is no real plot. The characters have no substance. Even the special effects are horrible.Rob Zombie needs to learn that he can't write or direct. He's ruined everything he's touched, and this film is no exception. If you like what he does, then you'll like this film because it's nothing more than a rehash of his depth-less characters doing the exact same things they've done before with a completely direction-less and vapid plot. Otherwise, steer clear and watch something else which he didn't have a part of.",3 from Hell
257,hydeelliott,Oh Rob What have you done!!!!!!!,3,28 October 2019,"SPOILERS
Let me first start by saying I loved house of 1000 corpses and the devils rejects. Both really good horror films made on a budget. Both these films were serious video nasties.
But I'm afraid the series has now been ruined but a not so serious almost comedic third entry.This is where the spoilers start along with my complaints.
How was it so easy to get baby out of the prison without any of the guards doing nothing.
Why are there no apparently normal people in this film. Everyone seems like a complete oddball.
In the second film Danny Trejo was tasked by the police to capture the three from hell well documented to be responsible for committing the most gruesome crimes in American history yet couldn't remember ottis when they came face to face in prison. Perhaps Trejo was just keep quiet.
When they escaped to Mexico. Quite a big place. The hotel they stay at just happens to Run by trejos son. Fancy that.Then you had almost carbon copy scenes. Baby meeting the party guy. Them getting jumped just after a major party.I mean I did still sort of enjoy it but I'm afraid what could have been great has been ruined",3 from Hell

265,wynnterpavlich,I Don't Want To Write a Bad Review BUT,2,23 March 2021,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am a fan of Rob Zombie, both his films and music and as such, went into this film with relatively high expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses and the characters whom some of which return in this installment. The characters that return are Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding. Captain Spaulding is only in the movie for the first five or so minutes and the rest revolves around the first two with the addition of Winslow Foxworth- the name of which I had to look up as I couldn't remember it five minutes after viewing. I don't know exactly where to start, but I suppose I'll say that the movie left me genuinely annoyed.
I loved the character of Baby in HO1000C, I thought she was fun, silly and quirky enough. Sherri Moon did a great job giving life to a unique character. Now I don't want to critic her acting because this is more of a complaint on the writing, but this version of Baby was an over exaggerated caricature and hard to sit through. Her introduction scene in the prison with Joan Jett's Wild One playing in the background was laughable, quite literally causing me to giggle in what was suppose to be (I'm assuming) a serious moment. Now I've never been to prison, but the fact that her hair was completely set in beachy curls the entirety of her prison stay seemed a bit unrealistic, as well as seemingly always having mascara on.
Otis was the least bothersome in my opinion. He didn't seem to deviate much from his original character and his scenes were the most enjoyable overall. There were a few lines that gave me a laugh as well as making me smile. Bill Moseley is good at combining horror and comedy and although its predecessor was better at depicting that, the statement still holds true for this film.
Now Foxworth was my least favorite of the three. He was an unlikable character with scenes that were either dull or annoying. His interactions with Otis felt repetitive and if it were a drinking game for how many times the pair said ""motherfvcker"" I'd be dead halfway through. It's said though, that a good actor creates an unlikable character so in that regard, hats off to Richard Brake.
All in all, I can't say I'd recommend this film. The dialogue was often ridiculous and edgy, the characters were mostly bothersome, and the cinematography lacked the gritty charm usually present in Rob Zombie's film. Call it narcissistic or self indulgent, but I preferred when he put his own music in his films, feeling that it fit the theme more. For a horror movie, I can easily say the most horrifying thing was the photograph of Ronald Regan hanging in the prison office.",3 from Hell
266,angelamosleymn,Stop giving this guy money to make movies.,2,7 October 2020,The worst acting I've ever seen in any movie.

267,emmaharvey-87805,Sid Haig is Great,6,24 November 2020,"Let's start witnits not as good as the first 2 films.
But due to the 13 year gap between this one and previous film they had to explain how much they've aged.
Richard Brake is great and never even attempts to replace aptain Spaulding.
As much as I like Richard Brake appearing centre stage, his acting ability deserves all the dues he does.
However I wish Rob Zombie had wrote and filmed it 2 or 3 years previous so Sid Haig could of been it.
But on the other hand he'd never of gotten a good a send of as he did.
Decent offering and there's a lot worse out there.",3 from Hell
268,Bedsit_Cinema,A walk down a murderous memory lane,8,29 October 2019,"I'm not going to go too much into the plot or the hows and whys of the Firefly survival, but essentially the trio from The Devil's Rejects are all still going at the start of 3 From Hell.My first thought was that Sid Haig, as Captain Spaulding looked so old. Ill, even. It's no spoiler to say Spaulding doesn't last long, given the three on the 3 From Hell poster doesn't feature him. Sadly, Haig passed away last month. He does use his screen time to good effect, though. It's so hard to say goodbye, but thanks for the murderings.Joined by Otis's half brother Winslow, the 3 From Hell go on the run from the law. Winslow is, well, let's just say he had big (clown) shoes to fill and while it's great Captain Spaulding isn't replaced by a cheap imitation, you get the impression even Baby and Otis are using Winslow as means to an end.On those two- years later both on and off screen and Otis now looks like Satan dressed up as Gandalf the Grey. Baby is still completely unhinged and great fun, Sheri Moon Zombie really turns the loony all the way up to eleven.3 From Hell is relentlessly nasty, but that's why I was watching. It's also very weird, but again that's why I was watching. It's a brilliant trick of storytelling to be able to create the Firefly family, who rape and murder at will, and yet make the audience root for them. Most of the time, anyway. When they aren't butchering they're great company. Sometimes even when they are.There are very few innocents in the world Rob Zombie has created across these three films.Stylistically somewhere between the first two films, 3 From Hell takes delirious delight in the decimation the three's road trip leaves in its wake. I did too, the two hour running length raced past me in a haze of trippy gore.3 From Hell is a walk down a murderous memory lane. Superbly surreal and schlocky, I loved every minute.",3 from Hell
269,i-t-1,Make up your own mind!,8,17 October 2019,It's a good film. Not as good as TDR however it's great to see Rob go in a different direction and didn't pander and give me what I expected.On a downside you can see how Sids illness impacted the film.

His masterpiece had come and gone 15 years ago and yet the too often need to relish in past greatness came back to haunt him. The film is nothing like its predecessor's. Its pacing is slow and even annoying at times. Worse the film becomes derivative as it goes on taking useless over amassed tropes to new heights.

273,fortnight_kmcmillen,Damn good film,7,17 October 2019,"I'm the first to say that what the Devil's Rejects was can never be recreated. Yes, only having one scene with Captain Spaulding was sad, but can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that we were able to at least have him involved in the film at all? All you have to do is see that scene with him and you know how sick he was. It isn't like he was abandoned in the film all together either, the scene in Mexico where Baby and Otis are having an honest discussion about it was definitely a moment for me. Foxy is most a welcome addition in my eyes. Richard Brake is a hell of an actor and rounded out the three well. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but it surpassed my expectations. Yes, it does follow the same formula as Rejects in a way, but what else do you expect from a murder clan on the run? The ending left me with a couple questions but I am overall satisfied. Zombie had to rewrite this film so many times and facing the struggles they did to even have Sid in the film and give him the best send off they could and then having to introduce a new character all together, well hell I say bravo.",3 from Hell
274,justino1996,Something was off from the start,5,22 September 2019,"I attended the 3rd and final night of the film's theatrical presentation. The 3rd night happened to be a double feature featuring The Devil's Rejects leading right into it's sequel. I think this was unfortunately a fatal decision since it truly shows how inferior of a film this is to its predecessor. From incredible first act problems to 75% of plot points being rehashed from the previous film, 3 From Hell falls flat. Imagine a car continuously stalling, it gets so close to taking off, but perpetually stalls. This film lacked that dirty, nasty, gross taste we expect with a Rob Zombie film and instead replaces it with silly silly humor and Hollywood production. The film gradually feels more Hollywood and standard as we approach the third act which presents itself like one big reshot 3rd act almost completely separate from themes and character arcs presented in the first half of the film. While it was a joy to see the Firefly family once again, I feel this film ultimately tarnishes the image of the first two thirds of this trilogy.

Theres a lot of Blood and profanity BUT no matter how much of that you toss into a movie it doesn't make it any better.
This is by far one of his worst movies ( and that's coming from someone who found enjoyment in 31 and lords of Salem )
Here's the bad. The plot has little to no meat on it, the zoomed in angles makes it hard to enjoy the violence cause all you see at times is a cheekbone, then blood, palm, then blood and so on. The characters you want to see more of have little to no screen time, and everything is so exaggerated that you really have to suspend ALL DISBELIEF while watching.Save your money and rent it in a couple of weeks cause yes......this is a straight to DVD kinda movie that stole people's money for a 3 day release.",3 from Hell

So the film starts with how despite of taking 20 bullets a piece, all 3 survived but then Spaulding died... and something was off about the story from the get go. The other two remain and the third of the '3' is completed by the 2's half brother. And throughout the movie you're just waiting that somehow Captain Spaulding will show up and rescue the movie. Spaulding has the screen for a minute and Tiny is mentioned once towards the end. Expect the gruesomeness, the naked murders, the sadistic humor... but you will be disappointed.

This film was rewritten several times last minute simply because one of the leads just couldn't do the role anymore. It's incredibly sad that was what happened and of course nobody wants anything but for Sid to be happy and healthy again but the fact is that life forced a change.if it had been made a year before or so maybe we would have gotten the original idea but for what it is this movie still manages to be a good sequel. Otis has matured into a grizzled felon who just seems to want what little family he has left and a place to fuck, drink and otherwise debatch to his hearts content. Baby is literally insane after years in solitary and shines(as she her self so eloquently put it) the star of the fucking show. As for Foxy, while not the Cap' he's still a nice creepy white trash companion for the last remaining Rejects.

The complaint everyone here has it common is that the plot structure is basically the same one from Rejects. And yeah I think that Rob Zombie could have put a little more effort into making it different. Thats actually the only reason this didn't get a 10 from me. But plot has never really been Zombie's forte in movie making. So i enjoyed 3 from Hell because the plot has been done before, the Fireflys go on a murderous rampage, however this movie still hits harder than a ton of bricks! it is entertaining, brutal, and well acted. If Rob can take an old plot and spin it into a thrill ride like this, I'd just love to see more work like 31. That movie didn't have much plot either. It was carried by the crazy characters, acting, and violence. This is also the case with 3 from Hell. Folks that gave this movie a bad rating were clearly looking for something else. Something that frankly i do not think could have been even delivered to them in a sequel to the Devil's Rejects. Its a movie about the Firefly's doing what they do best, Killing! i honestly dont know what else people expected to see here. 3 from hell is fantastic for what it is.

Because it's basically The Devil's Rejects.The opening prison montage is classic Rob Zombie with his 70s filters and grindhouse aesthetics, but then Captain Spaulding is show for about a minute and then killed off-screen. Now what happens next is almost identical to The Devil's Rejects, with the Firefly gang (now including a new brother from nowhere?) taking a family hostage, doing sadistic things to them, killing them, and then heading to Mexico to party with strippers and alcohol. Oh yeah, and then they fight a Mexican gang, or something, called the Black Satans and at that point I kind of stopped paying attention.Anyways, this movie is for die-hard Zombie fans, and even those (like myself) may find little pleasure in watching the same old retread we've seen at least twice before.",3 from Hell

Rejects is a great lesson in how to mix horror with comedy and blur the lines between good and evil, where as for me 1000 corpses was all style over substance.It's because of Devil's Rejects that 3 from hell suffers, we already know Baby and we already know Otis and where their character development felt fresh in Devils Rejects it just feels a bit rehashed in 3 from Hell. So with that said what other characters can then take up the mantle? Richard Brake's character is a decent edition to the family but not a patch on his role in 31, and then there is no Sheriff Wydell style character within this to get behind or to hate so you're just kind of left with Baby and Otis doing what they do best - slicing and dicing, which is fine but we've seen that all before. There isn't really much suspense in this either which might be what Rob was going for and the musical score just doesn't have the oomph of Reject's either.Having said all that, if I hadn't seen Rejects I would probably think this was a good movie, which I do, but compared to Rejects it pales in comparison as there is nothing new. We don't find anything new out about the Firefly Family, and as I say, they continue to just do what they've done before.A good movie that just lacks a bit of edge.",3 from Hell

This is not the movie that Three From Hell was supposed to be.I'm a big fan of Rob Zombie and while yes, the movie was like a remake of Devil's Rejects without Spaulding, that's the foundation they were given. I feel like in this context, we are not getting the movie we were supposed to get and that's why it didn't cover new ground, but rather revisited OG ideasThere are a lot of problems with the plot because of the replacement. It felt like he rushed through writing the plot. I didn't like who they replaced Sid Haig with.

I think one of the major reasons people are upset with the movie was because they had high hopes with how bad  Devil's Rejects was.",3 from Hell

I love HOTC and Devils Rejects as well as, the Halloween remakes, could watch them over and over but this one.... just no. I usually really dig Sherri Moon (loved Lords of Salem) but I just could not stomach her in this film. Almost like Rob was showcasing her, like this is my wife; it was annoying to be honest.

After watching the movie I realize the marketing wasn't exactly deceptive, but just that it showed off the best parts of the film.It was boring to say the least. It's such a baby movie? Don't show this movie to actual babies, but I mean, I guess an edgy teenager might find it exhilarating and hilarious. The jokes are swear words, gross-outs, and murders that the gang commit. It doesn't exactly offend or shock, so much as it just feels like someone hitting you over and over the head with: ""WHOA! WE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO SAY THAT, HUH?!""Once the trio gets to Mexico, you'll be feeling as bored as the actors look. Rob's music is rad, but maybe get a different script writer, director, and producer? Maybe just let him invest and pitch an idea or two.",3 from Hell
312,dunkinsavage,5 / 10,5,26 October 2020,"Do i think this was a bad movie? No.
Do i think it belonged in this series ? No.
But it has been made and presented already and you cant go back on that.
I believe the film was more unique in its own way , just as The Devils rejects was also a bit more unique to House of a Thousand corpses.
HOTC was very ""slasher"" and really dug deep into the dark secrets occuring in the middle of the night. It stuck to one story and kept it going until there was nothing left to play from.
TDR was a few different stories pushed into one movie , where mutliple characters were quickly killed off to keep the story going.
We are met at the end where the 3 surviving characters are suppose met with their fate? Still the most epic ending by far i have ever seen along with one of the best classic songs out there, Free bird .
We are then to see that they had miraculously survived and now ""TV Famous"" which i didnt truely like as an introduction, i believe that it could have been more of a flash back to the ending of TDR, where they actually left off from that perspective instead of where they did.
Firstly would like to say R.I.P. Sid, but i wish the movie was created early enough to be able to include one of the best characters in my opinion , Captain Spaulding. I like that he was still a part of the movie in some way but to have had that full action of the 3 of them would of made the movie much better and reminiscent.
My opinion also refers to the time of the movie being released. These movies were classics (HOTC & TDR) the time they were released vs the quality to match and that feeling of an older movie is what gives these two the vibes and traits they yield.
This movie definetly felt more on the Grindhouse vibes and though i did enjoy those movies as well id expected more of a Texas chainsaw massacre vibe, which also had a few remakes that i believe had a great approach on the classic movie vibes.
( Would not mind a remake on one of those from Rob Zombie )
Or puppet masters which i believe is due for a remake.(SPOILERS FROM HERE)Back to 3 From Hell, i couldnt help much to find joy in a few scenes which i cant say i did much in the other two movies. i think it was great leading into the wardens house scene, and the scene itself was good until it took a sharp turn and switches to them to roadtrip to Mexico.
Now i understand they are on the run and need to high tail it out and hide out so what better place ?
But the way they played it out really just felt like a funny western film with some gruesome scenes. I did not like that turn, i believe they could of maybe had found more of a hide out away from the crowd and expanded from that.These are three different movies in my opinion
They all have different personalities with just a bit of a web connecting them.
I think more of Dr Satan could of been implemented into TDR as they did journey back to original property. (Not sure if that was an illusion to the character or not) but i found that to be very Hellraiser like' and i found that to go well with the movie.
TDR also had more of that western feeling , like From Dusk Till Dawn. And as much as i wished it kept more of a horror vibe , it still is one of my favorite Horror Films and always a high recommendation.
There is still room for a fourth in my opinion, and id hope that the 3 would have some how found a secluded house and gone back to their gruesome doings. I think taking a step back to HOTC and redoing some of that action (More Dr Satan) would be a good 4th installment to the series.Id give this movie a try if you enjoy most Horror movies, you may not be able to enjoy it as much as i did but i also disect movies to find all the knicks and crannies in them.
I give it a 5/10 only because of the sharp turns it took and the ending that could of had much more potential.",3 from Hell
313,slpowers-29457,Don't waste your money,1,2 April 2021,Terrible acting with no real story. Sid Haig must have died during filming and they had to quickly whip up a new story. That's the only explanation I have for why everything felt lazy. Sheri Moon zombie is in most of the scenes talking like a baby which apparently was meant to be creepy? The entire thing felt like filler dialogue just to make the movie two hours long.,3 from Hell
314,Dont_Bury_Me_Im_Not_Dead,3 From Hell but Going Nowhere,1,20 October 2019,"When Rob Zombie started the excuses by throwing Sid Haig's privacy out the window in a cringy interview, I thought Uh oh, he knows he has an inferior product and he's already starting to play the blame game. Then when Haig died (RIP Sid) Zombie starts hawking his wares by selling it as Haig's last movie (which I found out it isn't), I could just smell the desperation and it didn't smell good. Apparently Lionsgate thought the same since this didn't even get a Friday or any weekend screening, let alone a weekend release. If you have that little faith in a movie maybe it shouldn't be done. Well, I finally watched it last night and found out why Zombie felt he needed to make excuses and Lionsgate didn't give it a real release. I fell asleep three times. Three times. This wasn't a movie, it was a mashup of a bunch of scenes that had nothing to do with each other. At least that's how it felt. It was like Zombie had all these ""groovy"" ideas for things to happen, but had no idea how to string them together to form any kind of coherent story. It seemed like everyone was bored except the ever present Sheri Moon, whose over the top constant mugging was grating at best and I was shocked to see that she's starting to look every one of her 49 years. I hate to say it, but even Bill Moseley couldn't save this one. And now there's a half-brother out of nowhere and we're supposed to just say Oh, ok, yeah, that fits? I mean no offense to Sid Haig's memory, but even he seemed bored and like he didn't want to even be there. The health thing only goes so far. When an actor genuinely looks like they wish they were anywhere but on that camera, it shows. It showed in Haig's performance and many others. Even Dee Wallace, who is always great, seemed like she was only doing a favor for a friend and couldn't wait to be done and get out of there. Overall, it gives the movie a lazy feeling, like Ok here's your movie now shut up and pay me. CGI gunshot wounds, a ridiculous score that felt like it was torn out of a superior action movie, Sheri Moon strutting around literally every time the camera is on her, it was all just sloppy and lazy. The one actor I enjoyed was Pancho Moler, who made me believe he was actually invested in his role and having a good time on camera. Though I have to wonder if it was better written by someone else and still directed by Zombie, would it have been a better movie? Would the actors have been inspired and given better performances? Would it have gotten a better release? Would Zombie have ever made his excuses only to then try and sell us this mess on the back of a dead man? I don't know and I don't think we'll ever know. And I don't think we even should have been given this movie. After the crackling energy of Rejects, this movie was like a wet fart. You should have left them dead, Mr. Zombie. At least we would have still had good memories of them. This is a definite no buy for me. I'm kind of pissed I even blew 6 bucks on this as a rental. I'll be watching Devil's Rejects tonight to wash the taste of this movie out of my brain, and remind me what good writing and actors who want to be there looks like.",3 from Hell
315,nikmaher,I couldn't cheer for the bad guys because there was no bad guys,3,24 February 2020,"Let me clarify. The Devils Rejects was majestical in that no matter how debauched it got, by the end the lines between good and bad had shifted. As they drove down the hill with lynard skynard narrating their drive to destiny over a rolling hillside I wanted them to live even though an hour or so earlier Bill Mosely had cut a ladies face off and declared he was the devil and he was there to do the devils work. Tutti fu**ing Frutti they were a family. And It was the second movie that I ever wanted the bad guys to win. That was something special. I can only of one movie that got me to cheer for the bad guysA point missed in this. 3 from hell? More like 3 men and a little lady! Bill Mosely is relegated to dad jokes befitting of Paul Blart and tho 31 is often slated Jeff Daniel Phillips was superior in that movie and underused in this. And how...how...HOW! did Rob Zombie give us that who wins good or evil we will never know as the movie fades question as an ending in 31 to the tune of Aersomiths dream on so reminiscent of the end of TDR that it made 31an ok worthwhile movie to watch just for the ending....and then miss it so spectacularly in this, a film which demanded an equally spectacular ending as The Devils RejectsI know the end of TDR is essentially a rework of the end of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid... with a better musical score of course! we can also see where 3 from hell was trying to emulate that sympathy for the devil theme... the prison....... not natural born killers right xD but again it fell so short of creating that and get us us cheering for the bad guys. Natural born killers did it better.I applaud Rob Zombie for giving us an answer to end of TDR. but I detest he had all these years to make it what we all needed and apparently completely missed what was so beautiful about TDR. As a standalone it makes so little sense, and as a sequel It lost charm. Which is a ridiculous thing to say about a family of savages. I know :D",3 from Hell
316,ktmccollum7,I wanted to LOVE this movie,4,29 October 2019,"First off. Devils Rejects is one of my favorite movies. So I was expecting a lot. And I was throughly disappointed. Bad dialog, bad editing, weird and annoying camera angles. The gore and the violence and the vulgarity are all there, which is classic Zombie but it's hard to watch because it's so bad. It was like he was trying to hard. The music was off too... one great thing about both House of 1000 corpses and Devils Rejects was that the music was AMAZING. Good songs and perfect chosen. 3 From Hell didn't have that. I always thought House of 1,000 Corpses was a little lame too (especially after seeing Devils because that movie was just so good) but it's a freaking 10 compared to 3 From Hell. The thought was there for the sequel but unfortunately the talent was not. I'm giving it 4 stars because these are my favorite horror movies and Zombie tried. If you liked Lords of Salem and 31 you'll like this. Cus those were terrible too lol",3 from Hell
317,soulseller138,Pretty but brainless,3,8 October 2019,"Would have loved this to have been good but sadly it's not. I really like the 'idea' of Rob Zombie making films - his music videos are excellent. Aesthetically he's one of my favourite film makers, his films always look amazing. Shame it's always style over substance. Apart from the always dependable Bill Moseley the acting is awful - even Sid Haig is dreadful in this (for the time he's actually in it). Sherri Moon once again process she's an actress simply because she was involved with the director - far from being Zombie's muse she's his a look albatross, hanging around his neck and dragging the film down. Even the bursts of violence can't raise the film above the level of amateur film making.

320,Jillywilly7185,Just a giant cycle of other movies,3,9 October 2019,"This was a let down for me.

Like we get it, baby firefly is crazy and she's supposed to be a little ditzy but she's smart with the ability to master any weapon she picks up. I was very disappointed by how baby firefly was portrayed. I truly thought once Otis was telling Coltrane about how baby ain't acting right, they'd touch more on that. But alas, Rob zombie dropped the ball on this one as far as character storyline goes. As others have mentioned before me, this formula of horror has been seen before. I don't know about the rest of the viewers but I'm tired of it. I expected a lot more but all we have left are 3 movies where even Rob zombie admits house of 1000 corpses is just a preface for the rebirth of Satan's 3 in devils rejects in so many words.

Sure there is the obligatory CGI violence and senseless killings, but I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions. Zombie had a lot of fun making this film, and it shows. It travels a much different path than it's predecessors, in the same way Evil Dead II took with its claymation and 3 Stooges-style slapstick.

It felt like only a year or so had passed since the last film rather than 10+. If you adore the 2 previous films and love the characters, you'll love this one. Zombie's progression in filmmaking is apparent and I loved every minute.

It did take me a while to finally check it out, I just wasn't feeling all the excited about it, wasn't sure why until I watched and then figured it out. Sometimes you just can't go back to things.I don't know if I just got tired of the characters after all this time or if the movie was just really not great. The chance of their escape was very far-fetched, really. No one in the right mind would have given anything that could be used as a weapon to Otis, no really they wouldn't have. He would have rotted in prison. At one scene I almost felt bad for Baby, almost than I remembered all of the people she was involved in slaughtering.I love to watch stars show up in Zombie movies and see if I can catch them, so I enjoyed seeing Dee Wallace show up and they really had to work hard to make her look so frumpy, she is so lovely. Although, she pretty much sealed her own fate.I must have missed the reason for the Danny Trejo scene, it just seemed to never explain the reason behind that.It had the typical, blood, gore, nudity, sex, violence and everything that makes a great Zombie film but it just lacked something. I am not upset that I watched it but I don't feel any desire to watch it again and I probably watched House of a 1000 Corpses like 15/20 times.",3 from Hell

Length.This film just dragged on and on. I had no idea where the plot was going 2/3 of the way in. Baby becomes awful and obnoxious, progressively more so than usual (she seemed nice in person, but the acting has got to go).My biggest gripe here was that it felt like none of the protagonists had any consequences that could befall them, whereas TDR captured that in the ending.

Remember Otis and Baby arguing in a van? It happens again!There are motels, 2 scared couples quivering in fear.

Oh and I forgot, they are once again being hunted by some real bad hombres.I can't praise The Devils Rejects enough. It is in my top 5 of the best movies I've ever seen. This continuation wasn't a new chapter, it was a rehash of its predecessor. It was like Rob Zombie watched TDR again, wrote down his favorite parts, re-wrote the dialogue and changed their costumes.

335,brianscartoons,From a Different Perspective,9,11 March 2020,"We all waited for this film to arrive, The Devil's Rejects was a Horror Masterpiece and all exceptional horror films are hard to follow up on, but let's look at this from a truly different perspective. There are Film references galore and throwbacks are seen all throughout this film. The Helter Sketler trial, the Desperate Hours house abduction scene, the women's prison motif (riff between Dee Wallace and Sheri Moon Zombie) the Once Upon a Time in The West showdown and so many and much more is nodded to by Rob. We know the three main characters, Baby, Otis and Captain Spaulding, but with Sid's health issues causing Him to back out, we get to meet the half brother Winslow Foxworth (Richard Brake,) who continues the Firefly Families Misadventures. This is an homage film plain and simple. It's filled with special treats if you open up to it. Danny Trejo returning as Rondo, Dee Wallace from Lords of Salem, Richard Brake-Pancho Mohler-Jeffery Daniel Phillips-David Utah-Kevin Jackson all from 31 and more. So many faces that you keep looking for more. Emilio Riveria is an amazing addition as he shows up for revenge for the death of his father. Sean Whalen even shows up for a few minutes of screen time. For me this film met its measure and then some. I have done conventions with Bill, Richard, Pancho, Dee, Sean and Sid (12 with the Late Sid Haig who I was honored to call my friend,) and they all gave everything to make this film work. So what misfired? Word of mouth from overly critical fans and arrogant film critics killed it out of the gate. Along with a very limited release in cinemas (it came out on my birthday and didn't even show in my area.) Then a Quick release to video. The music was good but not Freebird good. inagoddadavida by Iron Butterfly was easily the best track and set the mood up for the end showdown, but still the music lacked as compared to The Devils Rejects. Investment: when House of 1000 Corpses came out we were just introduced to the crazy Firefly Family. When Devils came out we were 100% invested as we saw them develop and then we thought it was over. But in this one our remaining beloved family is torn apart as Captain meets his end and we get a new introduction to a character we didn't know existed yet, so it's a rebuilding moment for us as the viewer. You want The Devil's Rejects vibe, and you get some of it, but not quite enough without Sid being in the film. I loved it! You may not. I see the continued story, I see the character development, plot twists and story arcs; but you may not. So go back and rewatch it and then look at the things you didn't see the first time around and then you may see the 7 or 8 rating come out in this film!

I know that Sid has health issues that prevented him from being in the film proper but they should have left him dead or have him not survive the shoot out. Also what's with his final words sending love out to his friends and family? It's like he disavows the Captain Spaulding persona. If you bring him back his final words should have been Tuity fn fruity and it should have shown his execution and him smiling or pretending to be electrocuted before it happened or smiling and laughing throughout the process until the very end. Otis then gets busted out of jail by the newly introduced half sibling and this character just doesn't do for me. The second act pretty much solely focuses on Baby Firefly and her in prison and breaking her out. This is were the movie dragged for me and Sherri Moon Zombie got way to much screen time imo. She gets broken out and they make their way to Mexico where the movie finally picks up for the 3rd act which saves the film imo. The let down for me is that the midget from 31 makes his appearance here and befriends Baby Firefly and saves her twice but they end up killing him off. I would have rather had the half brother killed off and the midget joining Otis and Baby to form a new trio that settles down and starts a cartel/gang in Mexico called the Rejects/Devils Rejects/Hell's Rejects or something like that. The way the film came out is a barely passable and disappointing entry from Rob Zombie.,3 from Hell
343,mrshourite,Extension of Devil's Rejects...,6,17 November 2019,"****Warning Spoilers Ahead***Pretty much a continuation of Devil's Rejects without the coolness of Ken Foree or Sid Haig. That was the disappointing side for me. I'm a fan of Baby though, and this movie highlighted how crazy she was. Even Otis thought she was a bit gone after the loss of Captain Spaulding aka Cutter.Other than that, it really didn't bring anything new to the fold. I'm a fan, so that's my rating is so high. Not a bad watch, but I expected much more.",3 from Hell
344,deftones-18878,Not bad like everyone said it would be,8,11 November 2019,I came into this having low expectations from all of the bad reviews I've seen but honestly it made up for that crap show of a film 31 and obviously it's not going to be as good as the devils rejects considering the age gap but it's definitely worth watching and Sheri moon kicked butt.,3 from Hell

346,lauralemondrops,Disappointed,2,15 October 2019,"Such a shame. I really enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses and Devils Rejects, however I find that 3 from hell was a desperate attempt to revive an old franchise and make a bit of cash.It can be a bit hit and miss with Zombies films, as H2 was a bit poor too.Zombie should've left it at Devils Rejects, it had a spectacular ending and left the story closed (or so we thought).Completely unnecessary and left feeling very dissatisfied.",3 from Hell
