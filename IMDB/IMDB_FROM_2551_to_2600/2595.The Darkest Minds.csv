0,TheLittleSongbird,Futuristic control,5,12 August 2018,"Have not read the source material (have heard a lot of good things about it though), but did love the idea of the film, have nothing against dystopian books/films and there were watchable actors involved, love Gwendoline Christie in 'Game of Thrones' for example. Will admit about not being sure about seeing it, with not so good word of mouth from friends. Didn't see any critical reviews before watching, a deliberate decision, and without knowledge of it not being well received critically while seeing a lot of passionate defence. Seeing it for myself with an open mind, there are things wrong with 'The Darkest Minds' and it is not hard to find issues with it. There are also a fair share of good things, certainly did not think it was that bad and is nowhere near close to being one of the worst of the year. For me, 'The Darkest Minds' was a mixed bag and not an easy film to make of.Beginning with the good things, 'The Darkest Minds' looks great. It is very handsomely and imaginatively designed in setting, is beautifully shot, cohesively edited and the special effects are really quite good. Was also really impressed by the music score, which had such a beautiful grandeur, rousing energy and emotional sweep. The acting is not bad, above average in fact and very good even in the cases of Harris Dickinson and especially Amandla Stenberg. Their chemistry and performances have genuine heart, as does the whole thing about their gifts. Parts are fun, parts are imaginative and parts are emotional. However, 'The Darkest Minds' second half does feel on the rushed side, where explanations seemed half-baked and revealed too late when there was little time to go. Parts did feel under-explored and glossed over and the villain was like an afterthought. The dialogue can be very cringe-worthy too and of the characters only the two leads show signs of development, the rest being shallow clichés. Some of the cast are ill-used, Gwendoline Christie being one of the primary ones.Count me in as another person who found the ending far too abrupt and anti-climactic, another ending this year to be seemingly setting things up for a sequel (like 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom', 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Solo: A Star Wars Story') which is potentially dangerous in case plans for a sequel falls through. Am another person too who found the big plot twist far from a surprise and done in a way that was clunky and obvious. In summary, could have been better but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Darkest Minds
1,SnoopyStyle,It's like Hogwarts,5,3 November 2020,"90% of children have died from a new disease leaving the survivors with special powers. The government have imprisoned them in camps and killed the most powerful ones. Ruby Daly managed to survive despite being powerful. It's six years later. Ruby is uncovered and Cate (Mandy Moore) helps her escape. Cate is a part of the League which is using the kids to fight the government. Ruby runs away and ends up with fellow kids with powers; Zu, Liam Stewart, and Chubs.This seems to have been written by a high school student. It's silly to think that a dictatorial government would have any trouble finding a well marked van driving across a desolate country. It's silly to think that people would have a difficult time finding a spot on the radio dial. It makes the kids look stupid when they don't see the obvious traps. One has to overlook a lot. It's a sci-fi YA fantasy high school melodrama. Any actual drama is mostly accidental. The twist is foreseeable although the villain is a good turn. I actually like the villain but he is conveniently dumb at times. I do like the four kids on the road. I like the quartet. The rest falls flat.",The Darkest Minds
2,nogodnomasters,The Force is strong with this one.,8,20 October 2018,"A disease kills off 90% of the children. (I am not sure what the dividing line was between children and adults.) Those that remained developed special powers such as intellect, control of electricity, telekinesis, and mind control among others. The children are rounded up an tested. If they are deemed dangerous, they are destroyed.The film centers on Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) who tested very high and has Obi Wan mind control which she perfects throughout the film. She manages to escape and goes on the run with others as they are being hunted.The film is for kids, and sorry I liked it too. It ends at a point that would lead into a sequel or trilogy. Perhaps a TV pilot. This could be dragged out.This is sort of like ""X-Men"" for kids. The question we know is ""If you could have one superpower would it be invisibility or flying, which would you take? Now, how about, ""If you could have one superpower would you want telekinesis or breathing fire?",The Darkest Minds
3,kosmasp,Mind over matter,7,4 March 2021,"Science Fiction ... now if it is based in reality or something we may consider or think may happen. Might work for some and not for others. Now there is quite the stretch some may have to do, but if you can accept that people are able to use their mind for more than just thinking ... But even if you don't accept it, just suspend your disbelief and you'll be rewarded with quite the interesting concept and movie.Cliches will pop up of course, you can expect that for sure. But the movie and its actors are elevating the movie. It's not a masterpiece but it is more than decent. And maybe if you watch this as the intended audience this was aimed at (young, teenagers and so forth), you even like this more than many others did. Very well told",The Darkest Minds
4,lee_eisenberg,How could this have gotten negative reviews?,7,10 May 2019,"I understand that ""The Darkest Minds"" got negative reviews when it got released. I can't imagine why. It's got a good story and good execution. Maybe the critics didn't like the performances. I, for one, like how they did it. Do see it. Not any sort of masterpiece, but worth seeing.",The Darkest Minds
5,jboothmillard,The Darkest Minds,4,17 August 2018,"I saw the trailer for this movie at least movie, it looked good to me, so I ignored low and negative reviews from critics and I went to see it in a cinema, from the producers of Stranger Things, directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (Kung Fu Panda 2). Basically a disease known as Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (IAAN), sweeps through the United States, killing 90% of children under the age of eighteen. The children and teenagers who survive develop superpowers, and the government place them in internment camps sanctioned by U.S. President Gray (Bradley Whitford). They are classified based on their psionic abilities: Greens are least dangerous and have impossible intelligence and memories; Blues are mildly dangerous and have telekinetic abilities; Golds are somewhat dangerous and have the ability to control electricity; Reds are highly dangerous and have the ability to generate and manipulate fire; and Oranges are lethal and have the ability to enter and control the minds of others. The day after Young Ruby Daly (Lidya Jewett) celebrates her tenth birthday, the night before she entered her parents' bedroom, and somehow wiped out her existence from their memories, so in the morning her mother Molly (Golden Brooks) does not recognise her. Moments later, after being locked in the garage, she is taken away by soldiers and taken to a camp, she is taken for classification, she is diagnosed as an Orange, meaning she will be immediately executed, but using her abilities she convinces the doctor to reassign her as a Green, sparing her life. Six years later, Ruby (The Hunger Games' Amandla Stenberg) is still in the internment camps, one day the prisoners are bombarded by a painful frequency called the White Noise that is only detectable by children with powers. Ruby suffers a more adverse reaction to it as she is orange and falls unconscious, and wakes up to meet doctor Cate Begby (Mandy Moore), they know she is an Orange and her life is in danger. But she is directed to meet Begby in the boiler room, they escape with the help of Ruby's powers, she passes out again and wakes in a different car, Begby gives Ruby a pendant with a help button on it, telling her that when activated becomes a tracker that allows them to find her. At a gas station, Ruby accidentally touches a man and enters his mind, she is now fearful of Begby's intentions. She follows a young girl, revealed to be a Gold when she short-circuits the lights, she follows the girl to a van, the girl hides her under a blanket before it drives away. The two older boys at the front of the van are Liam (Harris Dickinson) and Charles, nicknamed ""Chubs"" (Skylan Brooks), and the little girl is Suzume, or ""Zu"" (Miya Cech). They are pursued by a gold coupe, bounty hunter Lady Jane (Gwendoline Christie), and Begby and her partner, but they manage to get them off their tale. Chubs tells Ruby, who claims she is a Green, that Begby is part of an organization called the Children's League, who recruit psionic kids to fight against the camps, but using cruelty and violence. The group stop at a motel overnight, and the outside of the van is changed, they leave and find a seemingly empty shopping mall where they collect supplies of food, clothes and other amenities. But the mall has a ragtag group of children hiding, there is a scuffle, but they realise they are not threatening, and allow them to stay overnight, but no longer. The group sit and discuss the plan to find the elusive ""Slip Kid"", one of the few remaining Oranges who has created a safe haven for psionic children called East River, one of the kids knows how to get there, but only reveals a clue to help find it. Chubs and Ruby eventually find a radio frequency with a broadcast directing them to East River, but they are passing Ruby's neighbourhood, Liam gives Ruby the opportunity to see her parents. Ruby goes to her home, but anticipates what will happen if she enters, her mother's reaction and soldiers being called, she turns away and runs to an open field, Liam finds her, they almost kiss, before Ruby pulls away, fearful what will happen. They make their way back to the van, Lady Jane ambushes them, Ruby is forced to use her true powers in front of the others, she orders Lady Jane to walk through the wood and never stop, no matter how exhausted or hungry she gets. The other accept the fact that Ruby lied about being an Orange, they continue to head for the safe haven, they are surrounded by masked soldiers, but one recognises Liam, the others stand down, and they are allowed to enter the camp. They are introduced to the Slip Kid himself, who is revealed to be the President's son, Clancy Gray (Patrick Gibson), the only other known remaining Orange, he greets them earnestly and set them up. While the others are given various jobs around the haven, Clancy brings Ruby to his office to learn more about her abilities, how she erased her existence from her parents' memory, and how to possibly control her powers, this allows her to get close to Liam. One day, Ruby joins Chubs on the dock, he says he hates the haven as it is like a freer version of the internment camps, he wishes to contact his parents, so Ruby asks Clancy to borrow his computer, but his condition is that she teaches him how erase a memory. Clancy then tries to rape Ruby, but she escapes into the woods, she transfers to him what happened, he threatens to kill Clancy, but Ruby convinces him to leave with her, Chubs and Zu. Before they can escape, Clancy and soldiers block the exit, he reveals that he is holding kids in camp for the purpose of selling them to the government, and he wants Ruby by his side. Ruby forces a commander to commit suicide and cause a panic, allowing her and the others to escape, soon enough guns are firing all over the place, and helicopters arrive carrying Reds, who set fire to the camp. Ruby uses her power to cause a helicopter pilot to nosedive, the explosion allows Chubs to rescue her, but another severely burns him, forcing Ruby to activate the button given by Begby. In the morning, Liam finds Ruby and Chubs, they are taken into custody, Chubs is taken to hospital, while the other two are in a private safe house. When Ruby awakens, Begby explains that Chubs is in critical condition, and that she and Liam will become part of the team, Ruby says she will only become part of the League is Liam is freed, Begby reluctantly agrees. Ruby explains the situation to Liam, but he refuses to leave, seeing no other option, Ruby kisses Liam goodbye, purposely erasing her from his memory, he leaves carrying Begby's bag, and Ruby's keychain given on her birthday. Clancy is seen gathering an army of soldiers, while Ruby salutes the thousands of children who have joined the Children's League's army. Also starring Wade Williams as The Captain, Wallace Langham as Dr. Viceroy, Mark O'Brien as Rob Meadows and Charles Green as Doctor. The young cast including Stenberg and Dickinson are charismatic, and there is reasonable support from Moore, Whitford and a short stint by Christie, this is essentially a mashup of X-Men and The Hunger Games, it is predictable at times, but you can't complain with good special effects, and exciting chase and action sequences, it's not a bad science-fiction thriller. Okay!",The Darkest Minds
6,view_and_review,Superpowers not Enough,3,30 April 2019,"For an instant I was just going to write that this movie is trash and leave it at that. Then I reconsidered. That's not entirely fair. The people deserve to know why. But to avoid making this into a long sermon I'll suffice with the primary reason.I turned on an action movie and a love story erupted. And not just any love story, a puppy-love love story. The love story with teenagers who swear they're in love when they have no earthly clue what it is. And no, they're not in love because they'd die for each other because a guy will die for just about any girl, especially if there's a chance he can get lucky. I'm looking for a captivating good versus evil super power movie and I'm being dragged through the growth and development of a teenage love.The only character I liked in this tween film was Charles (Skylan Brooks). He was book smart, street smart, and timely with his quips. He deserved to be the star but instead I had to deal with some emo girl and her crush.So what was the action if this was a love story?One day all these kids start dying. I don't know if this is a nationwide phenomenon or a worldwide phenomenon but the focus is the United States. These deaths happened over the course of days or weeks. Those that didn't die were found to have special abilities. The government, in their fear, decided to round up all remaining kids and categorize them based upon their threat level. Kind of like the terrorist threat levels we receive. Greens and a couple of other colors were considered no threat while oranges and reds were maximum threats. The low level threats were imprisoned while oranges and reds were terminated.Ruby (Amandia Stenberg), the main character, is an orange that has escaped. She hooks up with a small band of runaways and quickly forms a family. The family consists of her, Liam (Harris Dickinson) the love interest, Charles the witty comic relief, and Zu (Miya Cech) the young mute. They were mom, dad, uncle and daughter (I suppose).Like I said before, Charles aka Chubs was the only character I liked. The story was weak and lacked any depth. There was an OK display of super abilities but in this Marvel/DC era you have to come strong or stay home. Super abilities are everywhere now so you need to have a good story and some compelling characters along with the superpower stuff. Darkest Minds had neither.",The Darkest Minds
7,neil-476,I have questions but no answers...,7,17 August 2018,"A plague kills the majority of the world's children. Those who survive have various paranormal abilities, and are graded by the government from Green (the majority, with simple, safe powers) up through the colours to Orange (rare, and so dangerous that they are to be killed on identification). 10 year old Orange Ruby survives by pretending to be Green inside one of the the prison camps which house all children. When the authorities finally realise the truth, Ruby escapes and enters one of the underground factions.This film is an adaptation of the first of a Young Adult novel trilogy (yes, another one). As a result, there is no real ending. The story works moderately well as it goes along, but leaves you with a host of unanswered questions at the end. Maybe some of them are addressed in subsequent instalments, but the absence of answers here is pretty unsatisfying. The whole prison camp with sadistic guards scenario is difficult to swallow, for a start.The young cast work hard and do quite well. Amandla Stenberg is pneumatic, as she was in Everything, Everything, as Ruby, and pulls off a pleasingly emotional sequence towards the end.As a science fiction lover, I felt this had the potential to be better, though.",The Darkest Minds
8,trashgang,ideal for teens due the love story,5,12 June 2019,"Somewhere it's connected to some people of Stranger Things so here we go, promoted with that connection. Of course by now I do know that such a thing isn't a good sign.I watched it with my eleven (no pun intended) daughter ultra fan of Stranger Things. She did like it because it was simple, contained a lot of love story in it, ideal for teens. Further, when the 'reds' come in action she did find it stunning.As an adult it was a letdown. I dig Stranger Things but this was just under mediocre. Starts off great but once all youth is connected in the van the flick collapses into a love story and the real story what it's all about do falls a bit away. Suddenly the 'Tracers' are back and action is back but when that's over again, the love comes back.So ideal for teens but for adults or even Stranger Things addicts you just can skip it.

9,ksf-2,more pandemic problems!,7,29 April 2021,"How timely, now that we're deep in the worldwide pandemic. In the film from 2018, a pandemic that only seems to affect the younger generation wipes out 90 percent of children and teens. The surviving children are rounded up and sent to ""the camps"", presumably because the older generations are afraid of the kids' new powers. The various power groups are segregated by power,color, as well as living quarters. Things are pretty rough, but they soon decide to make a break for it. Can they find the sanctuary others have spoken about? Some similarities to logan's run, and also hunger games. When they DO escape, they realize that it's not the perfect utopia they thought it was going to be. It's pretty good... a whole lot of fast action. Directed by oscar nominated Jennifer Nelson, who was born in south korea. Novel by Alexandra Bracken. Stars Amandla Stenberg as Ruby.",The Darkest Minds
10,thesar-2,From the Dumbest Minds,1,4 August 2018,"I'm not even sure this is worth the review time.Not a single part of this movie is worth highlighting and even some of the worst of all time movies have at least something positive. Maybe when I calm down I can think of one. Wait...I got it. The actors WERE awake for their scenes and probably memorized most of their lines. Okay, bravo cast!I'm aware of the teeny-bopper film series Hollywood likes to make and most of them have been pretty pathetic - not to mention sometimes left incomplete: The Host and Divergent, to name a couple. Can't say much for The Maze Runner or The Hunger Games since I never made it past the first one of each franchise. And this will be the same: only one crappy TDM chapter for me.This soulless film had zero heart put into it, the characters were bland, uninteresting and contained zero chemistry with each other and even the comic relief was a pain to watch. In fact, it wasn't until 3 or 4 unfunny ""jokes"" that I figured he was supposed to be the comic relief. Overall, the production felt lost and without a director at all.Apparently, the grand majority of kids mysteriously die off and the remaining ones are sent off to camps because the government fears them. Hmmm, boy that sounds familiar. Perhaps it's too soon to make a movie about the U.S. Government separating families from their kids and putting them into camps against everyone's will.I digress. One kid escapes and faces multiple options of factions. In almost every other scene, she threatens to leave one for another, so get used to that redundancy. Eventually, they meet more clichés, predictable characters and twists and then the movie anticlimactically and abruptly asks you to wait for a part 2 of 4(?) I guess. Actually, my guess: there won't be another of these unless it can be made as cheaply as this one was for. My bet: $5 million MAX.The acting sucked, the dialogue was cringeworthy, the special effects looked worse than a Sharknado entry and ideas were literally stolen from the similar X-men series. Hell, it was even produced by the same company.Okay, I thought of one more positive. The previously aforementioned film, The Host, was definitely inferior to this, but that's just because it had an annoying girl's voiceover throughout. This, alas, didn't have that one worse quality.Totally skip this and pray to GOD they fail to make any follow-ups.***Final thoughts: Okay, perhaps this might be an unintentionally hilarious movie to watch at home with a group of drunk friends. Despite this movie being completely void of any real humor and DEADLY serious, I can see myself having fun with several great drinking games due to its repetitiveness and scenes/ideas lifted from slightly better teeny-bopper films.",The Darkest Minds
11,FeastMode,my notes,2,26 July 2019,"Some of the acting wasn't bad. the premise was cool. it started quick. anddddd everything else was terrible. i watched this movie blind, and i was so sad when i realized it was a YA adaptation. it still wasn't bad at that point, and i tried to give it a chance. but when the super cheesy teen romance started, omg. lots of typical genre tropes. laughed so many times at unintended humor. 6/10 on the hilariocity scale. at least it wasn't as bad as the 5th wave lmao (1 viewing)",The Darkest Minds
12,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,5,4 October 2018,"The Darkest MindsTeenagers already wield the greatest superpower around: they cannot be tried as adults.However, the special abilities the teens in this sci-fi movie have don't vanish at eighteen.When a disease wipes out most of the world's underage population, it leaves the survivors with strange new talents that the government colour code per individual powers. But when Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) registers as an orange, her power to possess minds makes her highly sought-after by a subversive group leader (Mandy Moore). Luckily Ruby has friends to help make the right choice.Boasting clichéd superpowers, pointless musical montages and a love triangle that dominates the majority of the story, this adaptation of the similarly named YA novel is the last vestige of the dystopian teen genre. Unfortunately, it does little to reignite any interest in the tired concept.Incidentally, the easiest way to defeat any super-powered teenager is by giving them mono.

13,westsideschl,1 Star for H.S. Graduates; 2 Stars for All Others,2,10 November 2018,"Still another movie of an unexplained mystery disease (except for the makes-no-sense neuro-disease offered) that kills off only children (90% actually - how, who knows). 10% left over are child/teen super x-men/women color coded as green (intelligence); blue (telepathic); gold (control electricity); orange & red (super duper powers). Baddies want to control these powers so sends them off to special camps (controlled w/sub-atomic frequencies - ughhh, more bad science), and of course we have to have renegade isolated escaped super-teens (controlled by Slip Kid!). The usual abandoned shopping mall shopping. Ripped off, done before, uncreative script. Hello Hunger Games.
Lots of killing of innocent people w/super dragon like fire breath powers, and telepathic make adults shoot themselves (also done in movies before). A couple of kissing scenes to satisfy that need; left open for sequel.
No acting; dumbed down dialogue; usual cheap CGI of colored eyes, electrical discharges, levitating things.",The Darkest Minds
14,Platypuschow,The Darkest Minds: Another doomed franchise,5,18 November 2018,"The Darkest Minds is the latest teen sci-fi franchise alike Hunger Games, Divergent, Twilight, The Host etc etc etc and alike the majority of them will never be a fully told story.It tells the tale of a world where 90% of kids die leaving the remaining ones with a selection of super powers (For some unexplained reason). The government rounds them up and incarcerates them out of fear killing off the more powerful ones.It follows the tale of one girl who is smuggled out and goes on the run. But who can she trust?Personally I loved the concept, such potential! Under the circumstances a television series would have made a tremendous amount more sense as I think this is all we're ever going to see from the Darkest Minds universe.Our leading lady is fantastic, truly stellar performance and it wasn't until late in the film I realised it was Rue from the Hunger Games (2012) all grown up. Alongside her we have the excellent Bradley Whitford, Wade Williams, Mandy Moore and Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie (Though all of them are rather brief).One thing that struck me was the leading man Harris Dickinson, he just wasn't up to the job in any respect and felt like a weak link throughout. I can't imagine how he got the job and question castings logic with that one.The main issue with the movie is that it's the same as the rest. What I mean by that is these teen sci-fi types take a concept and then surround it by the usual tropes that are so blatant and so excessive it damages them beyond repair.
This made the film cliched beyond words and criminally predictible.All things considered it could be worse but all the teen sci-fi tropes, the fact this is all we'll get and thus leaving us with an incomplete story and a weak leading man stopped any potential it had dead in its tracks.Great for what it is and I see the appeal, but this is to the movie industry what pop is to the music industry.The Good:Amandla StenbergDecent supporting castSome very good ideasHearts in the right placeThe Bad:Too many tropesVery clichedHarris DickinsonThings I Learnt From This Movie:Hollywood needs to go back to the drawing board on this genreA world without kids sounds like my kind of place",The Darkest Minds
15,The-Sarkologist,Not another one,4,20 August 2018,"If I'd realised that this was basically one of those young adult dystopian novels I probably would have stayed back home and done some homework as opposed to going out and spending three hours that I am never going to get back again. I guess that teaches me for not digging into a film before going out an seeing it, but then again knowing me I probably would have gone and seen it anyway.
 Basically the film is about how a disease wipes out a bulk of the children, and those who don't die basically gain psychic powers. Gee, that sounds an awful lot like a certain series of comics that has this regenerating guy with an adamantium skeleton. Actually, this film sounds an awful lot like that particular franchise, and in fact it turns out that because they have gained all of these powers, the government basically decides to lock them up and attempt to find a cure.
 Well, not surprisingly out protagonist manages to escape and meets up with some others who are basically searching for this place where all of their kind can live in peace. Gee, that basically sounds like pretty much every single young adult dystopian story ever. Honestly, it seems as if they have basically found another formula that seems to work, and every wannabe writer is suddenly jumping on board. Maybe it is because I am no longer a young adult that I'm sort of finding this films rather dull and boring. Otherwise it is just that I'm pretty much sick of well worn cliches.
 Honestly, I can appreciate where many of these films (and underlying books) are coming form. The world truly does seem to be run by a bunch of tyrannical old people who have little to no care for those of the generation beneath. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they feel threatened by them, so they go out of their way to keep them suppressed. Except they aren't just focusing on the young adults, they are basically focusing on anybody who can upset the powers that be.
 Yeah, there was a time when I was a young adult, and there was a time when we hated the powers that be because they seemed to be doing everything to stop us not only from having fun, but also keeping us powerless. Well, that is until we finished university and got our first full time job where we were being paid more than we knew what to do with. Suddenly we are in a different world, and suddenly we don't feel anywhere near as powerless as we did before.
 Still, these films do seem to be pretty targeted, and it sort of suggests that it is only the young people who are dangerous, and that all of the old people are bad and out to get them. Yeah, once again that isn't anything new - the generation gap has been a thing since back in the sixties. Yet in a way it is somewhat different because it isn't so much a generation gap, but rather an income gap. It seems as if the baby boomers, and to an extent the Xers, that have all of the money, and the millennials, and post millennials, have basically all missed out. Yet in the end this doesn't necessarily address the problem, and really only stokes the anger that is slowly burning up inside.",The Darkest Minds

18,cruise01,A YA adaptation that just repeat itself from other dystopian movies and just flat out terrible.,5,4 August 2018,"The Darkest Minds (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Darkest Minds is a science fiction thriller based on another young adult novels. Were the story is similar to most YA adaptations were it is a dystopian future involving teens and kids. And the conflict with the kids fighting for what is right. That basically sums up the story. Which we have seen before. There are better YA movies like The Hunger Game series or The Maze Runner movies. Others that failed like Divergent or The 5th Wave. The plot is a bit boring. And cliché. 98 percent of the children are killed by some unknown virus called IAAN. The remaining percent of children developed powers. Which the government finds as a threat. They start categorizing children in camps and there threat level with their powers. Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) was captured when she was a child. When she first had a breakthrough with her gifts such as manipulating minds. Years later, the government discover she is a threat and plans on exterminating her. Dr. Cate (Mandy Moore) helps her escape and hopes she is willing to come with her to a new organization called ""the children's league."" (Sounds like a kid's version of the DC superhero movies or young X-Men.) When Ruby comes across Liam (Harris Dickinson), Chubs (Skylan Brooks), and Zu (Miya Cech). They do not trust the adults and their organization on fighting back against the government. I feel like the YA adaptations are starting to wear thin with having better story substance. Since the concepts and plot are becoming similar just replace the conflict with either aliens, viruses, powers, ect. Ruby escapes the camp compound were the kids are being tested and experimented on. She is on the run with Liam and a couple of others. Trying to outrun bounty hunters like Lady Jane (Gwendoline Christie). Then, holding up in a hotel room (how did they get past checking in for a room since every adult is reporting when kids are on sight.). Then, they visit a beat down mall were they see other teens who are telekinetic. And they tell them there is a ""safe haven"" out there for all kids. Which they built up their own community. Yes, this YA adaptation does set itself up for sequels which we may not get if this does not do well. The script is flat with the characters. We learn Ruby struggle with the incident when she discovered her powers. But the rest of the cast like Liam, Chubs, and Zu are one dimensional. Yes, there is some young love when Ruby and Liam first glance at each other. And plenty of more glances they fall for each other easily. The ending exposition felt a little dragged out with Liam and Ruby. The action sequences are okay but does not add anything new. A small car chase with Liam using his telekinesis power to block the bounty hunter with a tree. And a climax involving the government showing up at the camp. And Ruby and the bad guy both using their powers to manipulate the bad soldiers to shoot at each other. The concept is ridiculous and terrible. Amandla Stenberg delivered a flat character. It is not her fault, it has to do with the script cause it did not do anything to build her character further.Overall, The Darkest Minds is a bad film. The plot is boring. The concept has been done too many times with other YA adaptations. You can expect the predictable love story and the good guy becoming bad as it sets itself for another movie. The action is okay but the visual effects needed work. The explosions looked terrible. The acting was stale. This film is definitely forgettable that does not leave a lasting impression.",The Darkest Minds
19,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,7,3 October 2018,"The darkest minds is an adaption from a popular fantasy book that follows the themes of dystopia that Divergent and The Hunger Games-Battle Royal, have set. There are too many movies with the same theme : youngsters with special powers try to fight the government who is aiming to use them as weapons. So, if you like these kind of movies, then you're going to like this one as well. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if this adaption does justice to it, but overall, it was well made and the CGI were great. The story was kind of interesting as well, though things happened quickly so the story has a fast pace. The performances were good too. So, I can't say if this one is a memorable movie, but it was enjoyable and entertaining enough.",The Darkest Minds

This YA story is derivative and generic, and it manages to telegraph who the baddie is much earlier than it means to.

22,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Darkest Minds,6,20 July 2019,6/10 - disappointing YA book-to-movie - didn't have anything that made it stand out among its compatriots - I think I went in expecting too much,The Darkest Minds
23,stevendbeard,Mediocre,6,5 August 2018,"I saw ""The Darkest Minds"", starring Amandla Stenberg-Sleepy Hollow_tv, The Hunger Games; Harris Dickinson-Trust_tv, Postcards From London; Bradley Whitford-Get Out, The Cabin in the Woods; Mandy Moore-This Is Us_tv, 47 Meters Down and Gwendoline Christie-Captain Phasma in the Star Wars movies, Game of Thrones_tv.
This is an attempt to start a new franchise-ala Maze Runner or Hunger Games-but it's pretty mediocre. You can tell by the way it ends that it's what they are trying to do but it's just not good enough for a sequel. The plot is about a disease that kills about 98% of the kids in the world. The remaining 2% become super powered-most kids' best dream-and they scare the heck out of the adults. I mean, how would parents discipline little Johnny for anything if he could wipe the floor with them? Anyway, the adults put the kids into armed camps and classify them, according to their powers and how dangerous they are. Amandla plays a teenaged girl that is taken to the camps. Mandy plays a doctor that helps Amandla escape and while they are on the run, they meet Harris, another teen on the run from the adults. Bradley plays the President of the U.S. that uses the camps to incarcerate those dangerous teens and Gwendoline plays a bounty hunter that chases the teens on the run. I feel I must mention; Bradley, Mandy & Gwendoline all have mostly cameo appearances.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, disturbing images and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.

24,alindsay-al,A Below Average Young Adult Novel Film,4,15 August 2018,"I saw the trailer for this film and I had some intrigue for it, but overall I felt that this was a disappointing film that could have hit a higher level of quality throughout. The premise of this film sees the majority of children killed by a disease, with the remaining kids having powers. A uniquely gifted girl leads a group of friends to try and evade the government. The main girl I thought did a decent job in her role, her character power is interesting and allows the character to be put through interesting scenarios. However, I found her character to be pretty generic. She is viewed above the rest of the cast and it just feels very similar to the rest of these female protagonists that doesn't do much to break the status quo. There is a supporting character called Chubbz and he is easily the best character with the best lines and actually added some life to this film. Though I thought the rest of the cast were very lacklustre, the paper thin romance, silent ally and generic villain don't add enough to the film to truly make you care. Also, if you heard Gwendoline Christie is in the movie don't get your hopes up as she is nothing more then a cameo. The story is nothing special and is things you have seen before, especially if you have ever seen any of the Divergent films. But this film has a pretty powerful ending that I actually thought worked quite well and made the journey a bit worthwhile. The script had some pretty decent humour in it, especially from Chubzz, the drama is okay at times, but too much does it feel like a soap opera and too ridiculous to really get invested. The style of the film is as generic as you could imagine, even the powers that are on display are things that we have seen in other films that handled it better. Overall this isn't a film that is totally terrible, but it also so forgettable that it won't be remembered in an way really which makes it a film you can easily skip.",The Darkest Minds

26,3xHCCH,Missed the YA Adventure Bandwagon,5,2 August 2018,"In an unspecified year in the future, 98% of American kids were wiped out by a mysterious disease called Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (or IAAN). 10-year old Ruby Daly was one of the survivors. She and the other survivors of the plague were gathered up by the government and put them in a camp. There the kids were classified by color, based on the special ability that they possessed: Greens were geniuses. Blues were telepathics. Golds had electrical powers. Reds and Oranges were rare, but were considered dangerous and were terminated on site. Ruby was an Orange. She had to discover how to use her power in order to survive.When Ruby was able to escape from her camp, she met and made friends with a group of fellow runaways, namely Zu (a Yellow cutie), Chubbs (a Green nerd) and Liam (a Blue jock). Inevitably, a romance will bloom between Ruby and Liam, a common angle in these YA books. They eventually found and sought refuge in EDO, a camp for survivor kids. I went into this film not knowing that it was based on the first book of a young adult book series written by Alexandra Bracken. Her ""The Darkest Minds"" series started in 2012, and is now already into its fifth installment. When it came to the part about classifying the kids according to their abilities, ""Divergent"" immediately came to mind. That book series by Veronica Roth began in 2011. So these two were basically one in spirit, riding the same YA trend in the earlier part of this decade.However, the film version of ""Divergent"" came out in 2014, just about the same time when similar YA films like ""The Hunger Games"" (2012) and its sequels, ""The Giver"" (2014) and ""The Maze Runner"" (2014) came out. That is the problem with ""The Darkest Minds,"" it came out at this time when this trend had already run out of steam. Even the sequels of ""Divergent"" and ""Maze Runner"" only did middling box office business when they were released more recently. Up and coming young actress Amandla Sternberg played Ruby. She has the star quality and screen presence seen in Jennifer Lawrence (as Katniss Everdeen) and Shailene Woodley (as Beatrice Prior). Sternberg began her career as young Cataleya in ""Columbiana"" (2011) and as Rue in ""The Hunger Games"" (2012). She had her first lead role last year in ""Everything, Everything,"" and now this. With the sensitive acting she showed here, it is not far-fetched that she will also earn critical acclaim in the future.Harris Dickinson played Liam Stewart. He was in the same mold as Theo James (as Four in ""Divergent""), looking and acting a lot like him. Skylan Brooks and Miya Cech play her other friends Chubs and Suzume ""Zu"", respectively. Patrick Gibson played Clancy Gray, the son of the US President and a fellow Orange who took a special interest in Ruby. Former teen star Mandy Moore (from ""A Walk to Remember,"" 2002) is now 34 years old, and played Dr. Cate, a doctor from the resistance (Children's League) who helped Ruby escape the camp. Bradley Whitford played US President Grey, a shadowy figurehead much like President Snow was in ""Hunger Games."" ""Game of Thrones"" star Gwendoline Christie had a few scenes as Lady Jane, a bounty hunter chasing runaway kids.Watching ""The Darkest Minds"" gave me a ""been there, done that"" feeling. I could not help but see just another rehash of all the previous YA adventure series, and that was also reflected in this review. It did have its own twists, particularly regarding a certain power that only Ruby can perform, but it will take sequels to explore how this story will proceed from the familiar set-up it had begun with here. As of now though, we are still not sure if those sequels will come or not. 5/10.",The Darkest Minds
27,peterp-450-298716,An uninspired and mediocre dystopian teen movie. Shrug.,2,10 November 2018,"This is not about politics.
It's about your children.
This is about our children.
We will find a cure and we'll save our precious sons and daughters.If you want to form a sentence with the words ""monotony"", ""mediocrity"", ""clichéd sameness"" and ""corny"", you can do that without any problems along with the movie title ""The Darkest Minds"". Well, I'm getting sick of the concept of dystopian teen films. Even though they mixed it this time with a kind of ""X-men"" mood. Apart from some crackling electrical flashes, a storm with trees crashing down and flying containers, there's not much more to see here. And don't expect impressive special effects either.Actually, I already had the feeling while watching ""The 5th Wave"" that after the successful franchises of ""Divergent"" and ""The Hunger Games"" we would be flooded with weak duplicates of this genre for years. Duplicates of which they hoped it could be the start of again some successful sequels. However, I'm afraid this is yet again another feeble attempt that will fail. Simply because ""The Darkest Minds"" is really embarrassingly bad.This time it's not a devastating war or an alien invasion that makes our planet a place where survival is priority number one. No, it's a sudden emerging disease (Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration) that actually kills about 95% of young people. I suppose this is a kind of childhood disease of a higher level. And those who survive suddenly have supernatural powers.They are locked up straight away in youth camps by the adult world. Allegedly to examine them and to find a cure. Ultimately it's because these adults, like with the X-men, are afraid of mutants and secondly because they are afraid to lose power. There, on the basis of their acquired powers, those kids are divided into groups. Each with a specific color, whereby those from the orange and red camp are considered to be the most dangerous. In other words, persons who're allocated to these two groups, simply are going to be eliminated. Likewise, the lovely girl Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) who appears to be part of the orange team after being tested.For the umpteenth time, we see how moronic and stupid adults are portrayed in these kinds of films. Orange means that a person has the ability to manipulate someone else's thoughts. You don't need to be an Einstein to know how Ruby manages to save herself from this life-threatening situation. The moment Ruby escapes from this concentration camp and joins a group of teenagers, you can get ready for the most sugar-coated and predictable storyline ever.The group of teenagers, consisting of Liam (Harris Dickinson), Chubs (Skylan Brooks) and Zu (Miya Cech), are looking for a kind of youth camp where children are safe. It's led by a legendary figure with the name ""The Slip Kid "". And before you know it, love is in the air and Ruby finds the ultimate hint to find out where the camp is located. And finally, there's also a mandatory plot twist. Only viewers who have fallen asleep above their popcorn, haven't seen that one coming. The only thing I could appreciate was the end. I can't say it was really original. But it's kind of daring. But I came real quick to my senses when I realized that sequels with similar nonsense are likely to be released in the future.To be honest, you can't blame the film studios to release such films. After all, the profit is the most important thing for them. And when a specific genre is already a hype for a number of years, you have to continue with it until the subject has been completely milked dry. And as long as the theaters fill up with teenage girls (With helmets on because they run into walls while being constantly focused on their smartphones) who dream away while watching a film full of female heroism and who swoon when looking at a handsome Boyband-like wuss, the studios continue to produce these type of movies.Till one day when those youngster themselves exclaim in disgust (the age of reason probably) that they've had enough. And despite the political correctness in this film and the moral of equality (an ""It doesn't matter what color you are""-like message), it still remains mediocre crap with superheroes in it. So even though colors play an important role in ""The Darkest Minds"", it's just a colorless (and also uninspired) teenage film.",The Darkest Minds

It's a sci-fi movie of course and we can't expect much logics and realism. But it centres itself more on the action (somewhat violent) than in the message. A terrible disease kills 98% of children and young people in USA. The 2% survivors got supernatural powers and are interned in camps because this is considered a threat.. A group of them however starts a resistance fight against these government measures sometimes using their superpowers (those who have them because they are divided into groups according to the extent of these powers and there is at least a group which doesn't have them). The whole movie develops itself around this fight and almost nothing else. There was a slight not too clear romance between two of the first characters, a young girl and a young boy not very well shown. A movie not bad but not good either.",The Darkest Minds

The choice of a multiracial group is crass product placement, the making of all adults the enemy is insulting. I laughed out loud at two absurd bits, he said ""I want to meet the unique you"", the girl had been abducted at ten years of age and been in prison 6, I think it's a case of what you seen is what you get, and when the boy survived after a burning and exploding helicopter landed on him was quite ridiculous.

Watching this film I've got to honestly say it was confusing as it wasn't clear who it was intended for and towards the end what could have been an excellent film taking it in one direction was ignored and by the end it turned out to be a simple love story.Of course as we have seen with Maze Runner and Mocking Jay it's now the idea to make a series of films drawn from a number of books and I believe this will be another one of those but this wasn't the best start, boring in places even which won't appeal to a younger audience. Could have been so much more but under delivered.Rating 5 out of 10",The Darkest Minds
34,bob-the-movie-man,"Oh no, not another teen movie.",6,15 August 2018,"I chose to watch this movie mostly because it looked a little like a cross between ""Midnight Special"" (which I liked) and ""The Girl With All The Gifts"" (which I loved: my number 2 film of 2016!). In the end, while it does have some similarities with these films, it is far more in the style of ""Allegiant"" or - even more so - ""The 5th Wave"": a film aimed squarely at a mid to late teen ""Twilight""-style audience. Unlike ""The Girl With All The Gifts"", which begins with a delicious lack of exposition, this film positively has exposition diarrhoea! A voice-over from our heroine Ruby over scenes of her pre-teen life (acted by Lidya Jewett) pummels the viewer with information that sets up most of the plot within the first three minutes. It's the movie equivalent of a quick wash cycle with 1200 rpm spin. Not that this is ineffective... it is just a very different approach. Without troubling with any sort of scientific plausibility, the world has been stricken with a disease that kills 90% of the world's children: a fairly traumatic premise to be sure. The only children left behind are those now exhibiting various levels of supernatural power: classed as between ""green"" (brainy but harmless) through to ""red"" (fire-breathing s***-yourself-stupid-if-you-end-up-in-the-same-room-as-them beings). Some I know might class all teens by definition as ""red"" but I couldn't possibly comment. Ruby (now as a teen and played by Amandla Stenberg) is an ""orange"" hiding in green clothing. Caught between the extermination goals of an 'evil' president (Bradley Whitford) and the possibly nefarious goals of a freedom fighting group - the ""Children's League"" - Ruby bands together with three other teens in a road trip to try to find a mystery figure called the ""Slip Kid"" who rules over a 'promised land' for teens (where they presumably ARE left to lie in bed until lunchtime!). It's a journey that will bring danger, love and heartache for the mis-matched 'family unit'. From the first fifteen minutes, I thought this film was going to be better than it ended up. A 'kids' film with a memorable emotional jolt was 1986's ""Flight of the Navigator"" where young Joey goes for a play in the woods and comes back to his house to find his parents gone and different people living there. This film has an unexpected jolt of similar proportions. But it then - unfortunately - settles down into much more familiar ""Hunger Games"" style teen-flick territory with a supernatural twist or two. There is a wholly predictable teen romance between Ruby and Liam (Harris Dickinson) that is quite sweetly done... but it is a road that has been travelled countless times before. The ending of that story-line is quite novel though, and one that now makes sense of the rather confusing trailer. Carrying all of this pretty effortlessly is Stenberg who gives a genuinely effective and moving performance. (If you are struggling to thing where you've heard her name before, she played the young Rue in the original ""Hunger Games""). Of the ""adult"" actors, Whitford has little more than a cameo performance in the film, as does Mandy Moore. The only 20+ person who really makes an impact is Gwendoline Christie, here shorn of stormtrooper gear and being badass as a vicious modern version of the child catcher from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". Taking a long walk in the woods has never felt so gratifying! In the technical arena, there is a nice score by Benjamin Wallfisch, and some clever editing by Maryann Brandon and Dean Zimmerman that makes best use of the film's meagre $34M budget. (Now, this is positively affluent compared to ""The Girl With All The Gifts"" $6M, but this still feels more like a B-movie in many ways). Directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (who only has a directorial CV with ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" and ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" on it!), its not a terrible film by any means and indeed it certainly has its moments: the surprising opening referred to previously and also a battle within a camp-ground adds interest and excitement respectively. But as a film clearly pitching to become another ""Divergent""/""Maze Runner""/etc./etc./etc. franchise wannabe, the story arc of the film as a standalone movie can never be very satisfying. Even along it's semi-story-arc, the screenplay is spasmodic with the motivations of Ruby at certain points (without having read the book) sometimes being difficult to fathom. In summary, it's a great and eye-catching performance from Amandla Stenberg, but otherwise the movie is eminently missable.",The Darkest Minds
35,silvermistvio,Feels like watching Korean/Indian long TV series.,3,10 November 2018,"This one is that kind of movie that went bad at the end. The only one thing I hate about movies is that they deliberately make a thing that can lead to another film. In the other words, they stretch on purpose. I like those ones that go with the flow and not deliberately making the plot.In the film, everything looks good and I understand everything in it until the final part comes. Ruby knows Cate's partner is bad. (Ruby saw him said ""you are not going anywhere"" when she touched him.) And Ruby can control minds. It means she can ask anyone to do exactly she wants them to do. In the final part of the film, Ruby chose to go to the League because they are the only ones who can help Chubs. And Ruby knows about Cate's partner is kind of a bad guy. Even she can't leave Chubs with them and she doesn't need to be with them fighting. I means she got the greatest gift, the mind control. She can control Cate's and her partner's mind to let Liam go freely inside the League and announce that no one (the members of League) can do anything bad to Liam. But why did she choose to wipe out Liam's memory instead? I think that's the only way to get to the next film, The Darkest Minds 2.If they want to do the next film, they can choose another way. I really hate those movies which choose that kind of way. It's like Korean/Indian long TV series in Amerian version. That's the only reason why I hate this film. If they didn't choose this way, I'd give 9 stars. But they chose this kind of way to end the film, I became to hate this film and they didn't deserve 9 stars from me. The 3 stars I gave is for their works on this film.All in all, the film is worth to watch once only.",The Darkest Minds
36,Snootz,Interesting all the way through,7,8 August 2018,"Okay, agreed this isn't a 10-star wonder film. But I can understand why some reviewers might think so: it appeals to their sense of justice and adventure. They enjoyed the movie.What I don't understand are the excessively negative reviews, which seem more rants than honest reviews.Let's consider the film rationally, without the attitude:Directing was good. Acting was good. Story was pretty decent, a conglomerate of other stories mixed together-- but it holds together, has a climax, resolution and ending. Yes there's plenty of room for sequels. No problem with that. The sound was decent. Special effects not demanding but okay for what they were. So what's to hate? That it's a film directed at teens? Hint: if someone doesn't LIKE teen-oriented movies, don't WATCH teen-oriented movies. Simple solution, huh? ;DI'm by no means a teen, but I enjoyed this romp. As tired as I am of government-against-the-mutants story lines (Marvel has just done that to death, right?), this one was pretty decent. There were no ""jump the shark"" moments, nothing was absurd. The roles were believable, romantic elements decently conceived and executed, and the ending a teeny cliche but still okay.The film tied all strings, was cohesive, the parts well-played and it actually had a reasonable conclusion. We weren't just dropped in the dirt trying to figure out what just happened. In short: it was a story well-told, beginning, climax, ending. That's how it's supposed to be.So come on haters, give us a break. If you don't like this kind of film, watch something else. Technically and artistically, cinematically-speaking, this was a decently made film, and does not warrant the 1 & 2 star reviews we see here. That's just absurd. This is by no means anywhere near a ""bad"" movie. Minimum 5 star movie, and higher if people like this style of storytelling and this kind of tale. Technically, there's really nothing to honestly find fault with. I give it 7 stars as ""better than most in this genre"".",The Darkest Minds
37,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,12 August 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The YA (Young-Adult) genre is filled with cliche characters and generic stories, so Jennifer Yuh Nelson's The Darkest Minds needed to be something different if it wanted to triumph. While this film does have some good points here and there, the same genre's flaws found in hundreds of other movies are all over the screenplay.Undoubtedly, the cast is the best thing this film has to offer. Everyone is fantastic which helps Hollywood understand that there are many young actors and actresses ready to show their immense value. Amandla Stenberg (who played the child Rue in The Hunger Games) is phenomenal as Ruby. Her character gets the most development, and she is an exceptionally compelling lead. Amandla perfectly incorporates her role and shares an amazing chemistry with her fellow colleagues.Skylan Brooks portrays Chubs, and he makes use of his script to elevate his character by using some personal, funny expressions, making him a very likable character. Miya Cech (Zu) does not say a word, but she is as cute as a little girl can be by sharing some adorable moments with Ruby. Harris Dickinson is okay as Liam, but his character is connected to one of my major issues, which (not) surprisingly is familiar to 99% of the genre's movies.Every YA film needs to have a romance or a love triangle. It seems to be a rule that if someone breaks it, something terrible might happen (like the movie actually being good ... how awful would that be?!). So, naturally, that does not go well. The romance starts by being incredibly forced by joining two characters and instantaneously making them fall in love. Then, it adds another shallow character so a love triangle can happen, and there you go ... Drama! Unoriginal, boring and it does not help an already convoluted screenplay.Jennifer Yuh Nelson was surely obliged by the production companies to make this a first of many films. Sadly, the intriguing premise suffers from subplots and secondary characters that have nothing to do with the main thread. Characters who are supposed to be a big deal, barely have any screentime but they needed to set up something that might be important ... For the next installments.This was certainly an issue for the writers because there are tons of inconsistencies with the plot, especially with Ruby's powers. In one scene, she seems to have total control of her skills, but in the next one, she's saying she does not have a clue of how to do it. This happens continuously throughout the movie with other kids too, originating a lot of plot devices and conveniences. When it is needed for them to know and efficiently use their powers, they all know how to do it. There are clear X-Men similarities, and they are all pretty badly explored, besides being extremely unimaginative.The pacing is also an issue. Since the plot is fairly predictable, the lack of action increases the boredom levels. Finally, when the third act arrives, there are some cool action moments where different characters use their powers. However, those scenes' resolutions are unlikely, and there are incongruities between each character's fate. This could have been a great film but the pressure to make this a saga's origin movie brought it down.Admittedly, it is a shame because visually The Darkest Minds is very impressive. The cinematography is quite good, and Jennifer uses some beautiful wide shots which allows her to display one of the premise's most interesting traits. The visual effects employed for the powers are surprisingly remarkable for a YA film, and the score is beautiful. It perfectly accompanies Ruby's journey, by elevating both the emotional and action-heavy scenes with some great soundtracks.With so many generic YA stories out there, Jennifer Yuh Nelson unquestionably had a tough job trying to make The Darkest Minds unique and memorable. Unfortunately, whether by the lack of creativity from the writers or by the production companies' pressure into making this the first of many installments, she is only able to scratch the surface of what could have been a fantastic movie. The amazing cast, led by a rising star like Amandla Stenberg, and their genuine chemistry is not enough to overwhelm a generic story, filled with plot inconsistencies, cliche characters, and tedious pacing. A closing shout-out to the camera work and the technical attributes, which positively saved this film from a worse review.",The Darkest Minds
38,Beejerman,JEER - (3 stars out of 10),3,7 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...I'm thinking the books are better than this movie was. They would have to be since this movie was pretty bad on most levels. I haven't read any of the books, but I might, just to get a better viewpoint on the story.The film follows the exploits of a young, 10-year-old girl named Ruby, who is stricken with some sort of disease that affects all of the children around the globe. Some of the kids, it kills - and the others are captured and taken to holding camps and sorted by colors. Green being the lowest level of threat to mankind (the brainiacs), Blues the next level of threat (the telekinetics), Gold or Yellow is the next level (ability to control electricity), and then there are the Reds (fire breathers) and Oranges (mental manipulation and mind control). She convinces the powers that be she is a Green for self-preservation.Six years later, she is found out and is rescued by a worker there who is really part of an organization called The League - who recruits such children to be resistance fighters. She runs away from them and joins up with three other kids on the lam with varying powers and begins to fall in love with one of them, Liam (a Blue). No explanation is offered as to what happened to the kids and why. Just that it is happening. When I saw the final scene where she swipes her forehead with orange paint and holds her hand up in front of a whole assembly of other kids who do the same ... I groaned. Oh, brother.This was one of the weaker YA Novel adaptations I've seen. It actually started out pretty good with a lot of promise. The opening scenes caught my attention ... but as the story wore on, it became apparent just how ridiculous a movie this really was. It tries too hard, in my opinion, to be a YA movie instead of just a good movie. It's cookie cutter with poor acting and shallow characters. I just couldn't buy it.This is not a recommend. There were some cool special effects, but really, any movie - even the straight to video/DVD films these days - can accomplish that. I'm thinking that since this is a trilogy of books, that a second movie is undoubtedly being planned. If it is, I might check it out, but if it fares no better than this film - I won't watch the third.",The Darkest Minds

45,whitemanfromtowne,Colorblind,2,4 October 2018,I watched this film and I have one major observation for this film. How the hells does the young dark skinned black Ruby with two dark skin black parents become the light skinned black older Ruby in the flim? Was that CGI effects? Are producers colorblind? Or was it that they didn't want to cast a dark skinned black older version of Ruby to have a love interest with the white lead Liam. Just making an observation.

47,joeyford-55342,Good flick. It's been done before but this is a good effort -- fun film,7,17 August 2018,"Sure, they steal directly from the TV show GIFTED and the HEROES series. There is a lot stolen from THE WOLVERINE and the X-MEN where Angel's dad is a scientist who experiments on him trying to ""cure"" him. I'm pretty sure there are even exact dialogue taken from those other efforts. ""We are not a disease, we are an upgrade."" The most blatant one was ""start walking and don't stop, even when you get tired, when your feet bleed, don't stop .. never stop"" was word for word from the end of WOLVERINE. There were a few movies where kids were rounded up and given a grouping by color or symbol, the Jennifer Lawrence thing for one. But on the plus side, this is a solid story and it is well told. The special effects are good. The one where she is disappearing from past scenes was amazing -- I was watching closely to see if I could figure out how they did it. Overall, it is a fun ride.",The Darkest Minds

It was both rushed, and told badly, which ultimately made it end up being a movie with a plot and an existence really, that was essentially a pointless waste of time.It's biggest and I suppose best twist was undermined by a weak, aimless and uninteresting piece of story telling. The special effect were ordinary, cliché and unspectacular, the fight sequences were just bad, and the finale sequence was about as intense as a parked car.This movie is cross between The Divergent Series and Power Rangers, and somehow, worse than both those franchises, yet, though my rating and review aren't favorable towards it, I didn't hate this movie, even with its in-your-face sociopolitical undertones; I merely thought it was a bad, run-of-the-mill and pointless YA installment.4.4/10.",The Darkest Minds

It takes place in a (stop me if you have heard this) dystopian future where a virus has killed most of the children and turned the child survivors into mutants. The mutants are given different classifications: green smart, gold telekinetic, orange dangerous, and red super dangerous. We get to know this world via Ruby an orange. When Ruby is 10 she accidentally erases her parents memories of her and is shipped off to a camp. At the camp it is discovered she is an orange and they attempt to kill her but she wipes the doctor's memory and goes about hiding as a green. Ruby escapes with help and meets up with a group of young kids like herself all trying to find a place where others like them have gone. Of course Ruby finds a love interest and good friends and learns this ""oasis"" isn't quite what it seems. It is set up very clearly to have a sequel and that sort of ruins the ending. This would have been really bad without Amandla Stenberg and the acting. But overall it kept my interest.",The Darkest Minds
54,jdollak,What with this movie? How did it turn out like this?,4,12 October 2018,"I was really more happy with this than I expected. The trailer implied a very derivative story, and something about the tone suggested that it was going to take itself too seriously.It's actually not bad. The acting and script is about what you would expect, but the story is engaging enough to keep your attention, and it doesn't make you cringe. It's actually pretty fun, even if some of the bits slow things down.The movie has a massive, massive failing though, and it isn't clear until the end. Once we reach the last monologue to tie things up, and the heroine gives her call to arms... it's over.This is the first act of a three-act story.All of the problems that our heroes have are resolved very easily, usually by the next scene. They ID the bad guy? No problem, he's defeated in the next scene. They hear about a safe place for kids, but they aren't given the location? No problem, they decode the clue in the next scene, and reach the location in the next scene!This is all to say that this is all setup with no payoff. If this were a TV miniseries, they could have done this. As a feature film, it's a terrible idea.There are other problems. Lack of development of the main character, which should be an interesting thing, since she spent 6 years of her youth in a concentration camp. She has a lot to learn about the outside world and how to function, but that's just skipped over.This had potential to be a solid YA franchise opportunity, but I've never seen a non-experimental movie that botched the ""tell a story"" part of the criteria.",The Darkest Minds
55,phoenixinvictus,X-Men Rip-Off... how is it not obvious?,4,17 October 2018,"The idea that kept coming to my mind was that someone unimaginative decided to stitch together different movies. I can almost imagine the writers pitch to the studio: so we have a bunch of kids who suddenly gain superpowers like the X-men but only different... this one has kids with special abilities (the sound of crickets chirping in the background).
I mean they don't even make the effort to try to be original. it was just copy past change (some) names and voilà! The audience will never know the difference. I mean that scene with Lady Jane where Rudy tells her to keep walking even if she gets hungry was totally ripped off from Wolverine Origins as was the rest of the movie.
There is even a school for the ""Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters"" except that this one is called the EDO which is a safe haven for ""gifted youngsters""... so it's totally different. The main character falls in love with a cute boy named Liam. Ruby refuses to touch him, fearing that her powers will hurt him (much like ""Ruby"" Summers in the X-men 'wink wink').
The haven is really run by none other than the president's son, Clancy, who teaches Ruby on how to control her powers, and in turn tries to psychically rape her. Then there's a big fight and the Ruby and Liam are taken in by the League. The League want Liam to be a killer but Ruby doesn't want this. Knowing that Liam will never leave her (because he loves her), Ruby kisses him and psychically lobotomizes her love interest by erasing his memory of her (because stealing memories is what you do to people that you love). This totally reminded me of that time when Xavier psychically lobotomizes Moira, but only this was different. Wow! She is no better than Clancy apparently.
This whole movie was plagiarized from X-men pure and simple. Even some of the names are the same. Totally unoriginal and childish.",The Darkest Minds
56,TheMovieDoctorful,Tommy Wiseau's Hunger Games,3,19 November 2018,"The Darkest Minds is the Battlefield Earth of young adult adaptations and I mean that in the best way possible. It's a film so wonderfully and insanely incoherent and idiotic, I halfway assumed that it had been taken off of Quotev. It's like if Tommy Wiseau decided to both remake The Hunger Games and adapt New Mutants at the same time. I can't even look at screenshots of The Darkest Minds without smiling or giggling a little bit. It's one of the dumbest movies I've seen in a while, but also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. The ""so bad, it's good"" event of 2018 has arrived.As far as positives go, the teen cast is mostly pretty good. Amandla Stenberg gives a genuinely fantastic performance in this film that's WAY better than it deserves. Stenberg makes for a very likable and sympathetic lead and it's admittedly hard not to be invested in her journey to find a loving, accepting family in a world where she's directly responsible for her birth family's rejection. Stenberg herself has an excellent acting range, especially facial expression wise. I'm not sure what film she thought she was acting in, but I would love to see it, as I can almost guarantee it would be 100x better than this. Oh well. At least she has The Hate U Give.Harris Dickinson is mostly solid. One could argue that he's trying a bit too hard at moments, but he genuinely steps up his dramatic game near the end of the film. He has exactly one scene in the film where he shares genuinely solid chemistry with Stenberg that I admittedly found somewhat relatable and sweet. It very much felt like a romantic moment from my own teenage years (This scene also features the only good and tonally consistent song use in the entire film, Loud Places by Jamie XX ft. Romy.)The cinematography is certainly better than the writing deserves. The nostalgic, orange glow really captures the bliss of pubescence and the temporary, golden beauty of the teenage experience. Aesthetically, this is very much an appealing film to look at.That's it.Nothing in the movie makes any god damn sense. The premise itself is a major offender (The idea that the government would enslave or murder their entire adolescent population absolutely brings to mind the aforementioned Wiseau ""The government take children away for experiment, Amanda! Everybody betray you, YOU FED UP WITH THIS WORLD!""), but there are infinitely more holes in this unbelievably ridiculous film than that. Ruby's telekinetic powers have absolutely no consistency. Sometimes, she needs to touch a person for them to work, other times, she can do it from a distance. Sometimes she can see people's memories, sometimes she can erase them, sometimes she can convince people of things...It's all over the place. This leads to one of the dumbest endings I have ever seen in a movie, where Amandla Stenberg's character erases Dickinson's memory of her so the League will let him go. Because it's not like she could, I don't know, erase his memories of the League's ethical crimes altogether. That would require a script written by adults with actual brains in their heads.The film is in such a rush to get itself over with that none of the characters have any time to develop any natural relationships. So the script just becomes a series of ""and thens"" as romances and love triangles and grudges sprout right the heck out of nowhere. The rushed pacing also leads to some hilariously overly-expository scenes where the film literally tells us the emotional scenes that COULD have happened instead of actually giving them to us. There is a scene where, I kid you not, Amandla Stenberg's character is visiting her parents to make amends with them and instead of actually going to meet them, her character's cringeworthy voice-over narration describes everything that would go wrong if she attempted to do so. It's some of the most baffling ""tell-don't-show"" filmmaking I've ever seen.Remember how I said that the film has one good song that's used well? The rest don't match the tone of the scenes or the movie itself at ALL and feel like a 13 year old putting together a Hunger Games AMV with her favorite pop music. The film will frequently use upbeat pop tracks from the likes of Sigma and Mating Ritual during scenes that are should be serious, dark or foreboding. The bizarre music choices just make the film that much more of an incomprehensible and shocking mystery.Try and make a drinking game out of how many films this one rips off. From the original X-Men to X-Men Origins: Wolverine to A New Hope to Red Dawn to Superman II to The Hunger Games, this film doesn't have a single original idea in its head. Keep in mind, when I say ""rip off"", I don't mean something disputable like, say, Battle Royale vs. The Hunger Games. What I mean is that the film will directly take scenes from those movies shot-for-shot and recreate them, stitching them into this Frankenstein's monster of a narrative.This film is complete garbage and you need to see it. Most young adult adaptations are just bland and forgettable, but this one is at least really funny. I'll take 9 Darkest Minds over 1 Host or Hunger Games. And I'll be first in line for the sequel. Hell, give me a whole trilogy. I cannot stress enough how entertaining this trainwreck is and it's not like Amandla Stenberg's in any danger of killing her reputation after the home run of The Hate U Give.(Oh, and I almost forgot. While most of the performances are solid, Wade Williams is HILARIOUSLY over-the-top as the Security Captain of the camp. Funniest performance of the year.)#AudiencesLovedDarkestMinds",The Darkest Minds
57,Fudge-3,There is not that much wrong with Darkest Minds,4,20 August 2018,"The only thing wrong with this movie is the pace at which it moves - glacially slow.I thought, 'Coming of Age movie with super powers, it could work.' And it does when things are happening. The premis is really good, the cast, direction and production work well together. The special effects are well done. The villains are suitably obnoxious. The characters are interesting if a little stereotypical. The dialogue is good to average.I forgive that the characters are self obsorbed and a bit dumb - most teenagers are; so that's OK too. And anyway; stupid choices in movies are a given to keep the story moving even if some of the characters are supposed to be supra intelligent. And that's where we get to the weakness: the story.This is not a long movie but it felt like it because for eighty percent of the time nothing at all is happening. 'For goodness sake: get on with it,' I was thinking throughout most of the sitting. The plot is fine but the story is boring.I'm glad to say the cinema release was mercifully short; only a week where I live and I won't be looking out for the sequel.",The Darkest Minds

I'd like to have known some kids parents too. And for sure more on the president and his psycho son. To know how (and why so early on) a 10 year old would think ""erasing herself"" was the way to protect her parents. They could've had 5 hours leading up to that precise moment. A few flashbacks telling us how a few characters got where they were but not a whole lot. Even with all that, I still enjoyed the movie. If they had a follow up, I'd watch it.",The Darkest Minds

60,gerry_barnaby,Lack the impact it needed to get teh audaince attension,7,10 August 2018,"Ive Never read the books which has four books written by Alexandra Bracken which I would love to read it sometime just to get a feel for this film, reading most of the review it seems that the film is accurate to the book which is good for the film story. I did hear that the main Female character was changed for the film which, to be honest, wasn't the problem the film had.There are a few things wrong which I can understand why this film did make a lot on the US release as it only made 13 million in the box office, the film cost 35 million to make so it might flop if the film doesn't make at least 90 million by the end of the 4weeks it hit other cinemas across the world.Story-wise it was not very explained at the begin, but you get an idea of what is happening throughout the film, the special effect is brilliantly done, with the acting pretty solid and good soundtrack that give a wide range of emotions.The children with power are pretty much explained in a colour code which each power has a different colour, which gives the children some background, but it does not really explain why this is happening.All in all this film is pretty much average, if im honest it nothing that not been done before but still has potential if it gets a second film, which is more then like won't at this point with the box office takings but it just might make that money if it lucky,
Dislikes: The biggest problem isnt the casting, it's just the way it been written, yes it close to the book like most reviews have said, but the story just takes to long to get anywhere and when things do finally start getting interesting the film over. 
This is the reason why it not getting the critics attention, a story needs to be compelling when you doing a drama film like this which sadly this film slightly lacks that impact.This film feels more like the situation with I am number seven, where we get someone of an ok film, it just not capturing the audience attention or getting the reviews that it need to look good, for this reason alone is why I feel this film is gonna flop.",The Darkest Minds

Either way, the ending was very sloppy and that's not a way how to get money for making more movies.Going with ""sweet and innocent"" goes to war is kinda silly premise but despite that, i would enjoy the movie much more without the teenage love story.The beginning of the movie is probably the best part for me and i was kinda hoping to get a chase movie but i guess all the budget was blown with crackling road so reaching the ""heaven camp"" was not the end of the movie. Unfortunately nothing is more surprising like guy on top being the corrupted one so the movie completely lost my attention.Amandla Stenberg does good job and the cast overall should not take the blame for this movie.

63,rmarkd,"Not bad, just left a bit wanting",6,18 June 2020,"After some strange event, kids end up getting powers which are shown by flashes in their eyes when they user their powers. Super smart kids' eyes turn green, telekenesis kids blue, electricity manipulating kids yellow, fire breathing kids red, and mind manipulation kids orange. The government and other factions quickly take these kids to take them to be soldiers. But the red and orange kids are too dangerous and so they are largely killed.Ruby Daly (Amandla Stenberg) is an orange who escapes with the help of a doctor friend, Cate, who turns out to work for the League (which isn't clearly explained, but is hinted at that they're trying to build an army of their own). She then leaves her to join a bunch of other kids: Chubs, Zu, and Liam. Ruby and Liam start to form a relationship as the four look for the promised land of other kids who have powers but learn to live in peace and harmony.But the promised land isn't a promised land and the leader, son of the president who everyone thought was cured and turned out not to be also turns out to be a bad guy building his army.The four kids escape, but Chubs is hurt and can only be saved with the help of Cate, and the League. She does it anyway. She begs Liam to leave as they'd want to capture him for his past history with them, but he won't leave her because the two have fallen in love. Knowing this, she wipes all the memories they share so that Liam feels no need to stay. Then she takes her spot as, I guess, some sort of leader of the League.This is a pretty decent movie that's been done before in different ways. It's a teen dystopian future with a love story. Nothing really that special, plot wise. Sure, interesting concept, but they didn't get to do much with it. There are also too many questions that I assume get answered in the books, but I doubt this movie will see any sequels, so you're left with too many holes knowing they won't be answered in the movies. The twist and turns are pretty much expected. Ruby wiping Liam's memory was a shock to me, but I suppose not too surprising in hindsight (she did the same with her parents) and was pretty obviously set up that the two would meet again.The one bright spot in the movie was Amandla Stenberg as Ruby. She was great and I hope to see more of her in future movies.6/10. It's a meh with no movie-closure, but Amandla Stenberg redeems it a bit.",The Darkest Minds

65,jeannefrancoise,Sci fi with touch of drama,8,19 August 2018,"Dear sci fi lovers, now you can speak. The Darkest Minds is movie designed not just for sci fi watchers, but also for everybody. Why? Because this movie relates the drama within their main story. The ability of Amandla Stenberg (as Ruby) here to erase memories in other people's mind is explaining what the most important in human bran: The memory. The main story thereof is about government on how to control their people mind, memory, and identity. The uncured disease across America is just the beginning plot in most of Hollywood movies, just to give scenes about how America can do disaster management in urgent situations, but the most important the Director wants to show is that the ability of people to be together, protect each other, and then to revenge back to take back all things or people had been taken before. The struggle to fight is just the lead scenes to see that each people has their own right to choose their path in this life, no matter how strange they are in the society. This movie is powerful because the acting of all actors are great. We really forget that this just a movie, we thought that we see our own self or our own family in the story. This is also a sci fi movie with touch of drama. Yes, there is Amandla Stenberg, the most wanted newcomer in Hollywood and since her appearance, this movie is no longer the same.

Come on guys!!! are we to believe that Regular Humans will throw in ""Their Future"" their own offspring...the very few that survived the Evolution...and they are gonna thrown the behind Bars like animals? thus condemning the Future of Humans on Earth? because the Adults didn't received the Evolution upgrade and new kids being born are receiving the upgrade...so this remaining Humans are the last of an old Species being replace by a New superior species...their own children...and they are gonna just thrown them in Jail?...thus assuring the extintction of Humans? because this regular Humans are not getting any younger and the premise of the movie makes it clear that there are No More Regular humans being Born...all new borns either survive the upgrade or die...there is no 3rd option where kids grow as regular humans.... from that point when the regular Humans have imprison their own Future behind Labor Camps...the movie destroys itself.",The Darkest Minds

But I did like the movie and even thought to raise my rating a little higher because I think that some of the reviewers are being less than truthful about the reasons for their excessively low rating.

75,MooWoolf1,A little help for those who think this movie is good,4,21 October 2018,"To those that don't understand the bad reviews.
You haven't seen any good movies yet. That's the only reason you think this one is good.The movie compared to other movies in the same genre and even the same storyline fails at many points.
The characters feel like nothing. I'm not interested in them. This is because of the bad writing, bad casting, bad directing and bad acting. These factors fail to deliver a performance that makes you believe what you are watching.
The basic point of the story also fails. That rating and those colors.. The orange one says lethal when they are not that much of a threat to human lives.The red and blue ones are far more lethal.They only have 4 different kind of mutations for some reason. Maybe they did not wanted to fully copy the X-Men idea. There is nothing outside of the US ofc. They don't even mention the rest of the World..
The funniest one was that because the kids died every street was empty. The whole country was like there were only the ""bad"" guys alive and some mutants. Abandoned houses, supermarkets and stuff everywhere, yet when the girl goes home everything happens inside their house as would happen in the regular World. What??At the end it turns out that an 18 Year old kid took out the president and because of this he controls the country from the woods. The bad guys followed the elected president. That makes sense. This is how things work.
But they follow an 18 Year old kid who's in the woods for no reason at all?
Any soldier could finish that boy and that's the end of the story..But no he became the president without election!
Also for some reason at the very end of the movie the free kids gather in a stadium and nobody sees them. Even tho today they can see that there are 2 guys chilling in a house in Iraq and they can indentify them from the air but they can't see a stadium full of ""enemies"".How is this a good movie? The whole thing is just terrible, nonsense, boring, not interesting and again it doesn't make any sense at all.This script was written in like a day and somehow nobody read it before shooting. Not even the director. I would be greatly surprised if the writer and the director would have any chance to direct an other feature.",The Darkest Minds

81,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,It feels like a cheap X-Men rip-off,5,26 October 2018,"Darkest Minds Review 2/5Millions of children suddenly die and the survivors each gain gifts of shooting electricity from their hands, fire breathing, telekinesis, mind control and intelligence. They are all categorised by colours green, blue, orange and red and they are kept imprisoned in concentration camps. Directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (Kung Fu Panda 2, 3) and starring Amandla Stenberg (The Hunger Games) it's based on the first of three novels. Dark Minds doesn't offer anything new to the genre, it's just another young adult sci-fi adaptation similar to films like Divergent, Hunger Games and The Maze Runner. With such an interesting premise it never reaches the levels of those films often feeling like a cheap rip off of the X-Men films.The acting is wooden, the characters are bland and there is no chemistry between the two leads. The visual effects are okay given the small production budget but the overall film feels rushed. There isn't even a proper music score, it's just peppered with current songs in an attempt to make the scenes feel more dramatic. Also the choice of songs make it feel even more awkward than it is. Just as you think it's going to delve into gripping political territory it quickly turns into a generic love story which feels completely out of place. The dramatic scenes lack any edge and the humour is cringy and forced. The actors do serviceable jobs but they don't give enough conviction to their roles. The film would have benefited from a 15 certificate but the producers opted for a 12A and so whenever someone gets killed the camera cuts away.Once they escape the prison camp, there isn't a sense of real danger. These characters are supposed to be on the run but they get away with a lot. They can stay at motels, drive around in the same car and go to their old neighbourhoods without being caught by even a single person (This is a world where children are outlaws). Considering there was meant to be numerous bounty hunters they only get confronted by one and she gets defeated very easy. Everything is pretty much handed to these characters for the convenience of the plot - There's a scene where they break into an abandoned shopping mall where there is conveniently enough food and clothes for them all and there is also a radio for them to listen in on frequency.Even though the plot is about millions of children being kidnapped from their homes, it never shows the adults fighting against the system which was a missed opportunity. They are shown to just go with it being promised that their children will be cured. Whereas in reality we all know how parents would react if their children were taken to concentration camps. If they had shown the effects of this around the world with news broadcasts, derelict schools etc it would have had a more worldly gritty feel. But given the scenario, it's fairly lighthearted with only a few dark moments.With such an ambitious storyline the production budget should have been at least $80-100 million. It's like the producers knew it was going to be a bomb and so they only invested $32 million into it. They didn't even have enough money left over for advertising that's how poorly made the film is.
It's predictable and formulaic and you just know it will end on a cliffhanger leading to another film. It should have been as good as The Hunger Games but it sinks to the same level as The 5th Wave.",The Darkest Minds

The twist is good but recognizable at the point of contact. The acting was fantastic so I would have to say the direction was spot on. Amandla Stenberg really carried the film, and I will be watching her, she has a fantastic talent.The flaws were more environmental than theatrical but this probably stemmed from the book (not sure didn't read it), anyway the lack of extras or background people, vehicles etc. was a little hard to swallow.

89,pinemaples,The Weakest Minds,4,15 August 2018,"After watching The Darkest Minds, I'm wondering how a movie can feel simultaneously way too fast-paced and way too slow. Some plot points don't get the explanation they need, and many major events don't have the impact they deserve. It almost feels like the writers expected the audience to know what's happening because they had read the book, which I didn't realize existed until the credits rolled. It honestly felt like a high school drama project. Most of the actors didn't carry their own, and that's not just the children. That said, there were some bright spots too. Amandla Stenberg (Everything, Everything; The Hunger Games) was by far the most solid actor in the movie, followed by Harris Dickinson, who reminds me of a young Cillian Murphy. Miya Cech was just adorable as Zu, and I was also extremely surprised to see Gwendoline Christie and Mandy Moore of all people, who did the best with what they had. The special effects were mostly good, and the soundtrack was probably the best part of the whole movie. There was one scene near the end in particular that was really well done, and actually got a tear out of me. The Darkest Minds had a lot of potential, and I feel that re-editing the movie would have solved a lot of its problems.

113,ZombieGirlORV,Half the points for Half the Story it Should have Been,5,18 November 2018,"I try to be forgiving when I see adaptations of books into movies. I don't usually don't mind subtle changes based around minor details, like the way a character is supposed to look, as long as it's not pressing to the story-line or plot, and they have good actors, I usually don't care. In this case I feel Amandla Stenberg as Ruby Daly was an awesome choice. She was a great actress who managed to get across the feelings of fear and helplessness perfectly while in camp. In fact, most of the actors were pretty good, and had very little to do with my opinion of the movie. To be fair if I had walked into this having never read the book, I probably would have liked it a little better. But every time something changed, I noticed it, and it was every other second, as if someone had a stick and was poking me with it throughout the hole movie saying ""This is different,"" and ""That's not the same at all."" The book was a character driven story, the characters held a TON of depth based on their experiences. The movie got almost all of their characters entirely WRONG. First there was Liam, who's character in the book was usually calm, patient, and lighthearted, his naivety cased the others around him to want to protect him. He was not the jealous hot head this movie turned him into. One of the main differences was that in the book he ask others what they wanted, and didn't tell them. This was a noticeable difference which almost gave me whiplash when he flat out told Ruby that she didn't want to go with the League, in the book he'd asked her what she wanted to do, and that subtle change in the way he worded things changed his character entirely. One of my favorite parts of the book was the fact that they hadn't used any of the cliches which they had perfectly set up for, because it went against the characters behaviors. Something they quickly latched onto in the movie and did despite the fact there was no reason for it. The biggest disappointment to me was when I realized they'd changed Chubs into a green. He was my favorite character from the book, mostly because he was blue and almost never used his abilities, he was intelligent without having to be a green. The way he contacted his parents, and who his parents were, the way he had that book and how that had caused Ruby to feel connected to him. How strong he was and how that strength extended to his protective behavior over his friends. The movie got his character entirely WRONG. He was cautious, but not a coward. It was as if the director thinks it's not okay for a Blue to be smart, or for a girls boyfriend to stay cool while she's spending time with someone else. The characters they were missing also caused them to have to change entire scenes, not to mention the completely unnecessary scenes, which they added in for seemingly no reason. Another large disappointment was the story Liam told at the end, which could have been fixed by simply changing the word 'green' to 'brown'. But they lost nearly the whole story, which, when I read in the book had me close to tears knowing what was about to happen. When he only got half the story out before changing it, it totally broke the trance it might have held and brought me crashing back to reality, poking me with that stick which reminded me I was watching a movie. By making the subtle changes to the characters they did, the actions they took in the movie seemed too forced and unnatural. It was a story which was close to the book, but a lot of the unnecessary changes they made killed it as a whole. The characters in the movie lacked depth, and therefore direction. The actors did there best and made up for a lot of it. But in the end I was asking myself things like ""Why does this scene exist?"" and ""Where did that come from?"" Much of the time there was no point behind the actions they took, which was frustrating for me as a fan of the book. Also the end scene with all the paint on the kids hands and heads seemed really...awkward. To the point where I actually said aloud, ""What the heck are they doing?"" Just the worst of the unnecessary scenes. Though I haven't read the next book yet, and if this actually happens in that book, I can't be sure, but it was AWKWARD in the movie. In the end they got most of the surface area of the story right, but they gutted the rest of it and stuffed it with things I'm not even sure how to comment on, making it half the movie it should have been. So in all fairness, I'll give it half the points it could have had, and while totally aware that I might just be an over critical fan of the book. The director was also aware that this was an adaptation of the book with a large fan base, and should have been more respectful to the story-line and the fans while bringing it across to screen, particularly where Chubs was concerned. He was my favorite character after all. I really wish they could re-do the movie using all the same cast, and just do it right next time, we can all just pretend the first run never happened.",The Darkest Minds

I'm really not sure what the Moral of this story was even supposed to be or even if there was one! This movie had no redeeming qualities to it, It brought nothing new to the table at all. Its like Divergent for younger kids with superpowers. The emotional highs and lows felt flat and had no impact other the cringe and the whole plot revolves around parts where the person in question could have just used his or her super power to get out of it causing Numerous Gaping Continuity Errors. To cover this up they seemed to have put overly up-beat and cheery music in, while this isn't directly against the actors or actress in the movie I found my self wonder if this movie even had a script. Skip this one, save your money parents wait for redbox or just skip it all together. This is my warning, dont bother with this one.",The Darkest Minds
116,Kajohns49,"Very Bad, So Very Bad",1,30 August 2019,"First off, I did not read the book, I have no connection to this movie or any competing movies, I am not in the target audience but I have enjoyed other movies made from YA books (both the Hunger Games and Twilight series-HG I'd rate 7, Twi a 6 to 6.5, just so you know where I'm coming from.)
Not having read the book I don't know if the problem with the story was in the original work or the screenplay but it was awful. Truly bad. The end product feels like a couple of 13 year old girls mined their imaginations, building on one another's narratives until they either figured they had enough, got bored or realized that the whole thing was just too silly to continue.
The story was incredibly uneven. When the characters main goal is achieved it is given less time than the an unimportant story arc. There were too many groups so none got the time needed to create any reason for the viewer to care. Side stories were introduced and dispensed with and served no purpose in movie the story forward.
I don't think I'm giving anything up here to say that this story deals with children. I kept wondering what happens when children age? Are new children born? Why was one of the groups made up of people who would have been under 18 when the ""event"" happened? Why don't they have powers? Where did these powers come from? All things that the collaboration of 13 year olds at a sleepover forgot to include in their movie.
The acting, for the most part, was acceptable. I'm pretty sure that given a better script I would look more kindly on the performances given. There were a few exceptions that had me cringing, you'll know it when you see it.
The production values were nothing that a college student couldn't come up with. There was one scene that semi-impressed but for a movie based on special powers there was a distinct lack of special effects.
I stopped and restarted this movie five or six times. I almost quit watching but I decided I wanted to write this review and I didn't want to write a review for a movie unless I completed it. So, I disliked this movie so much I had to finish it! I am genuinely perplexed at the 7 thru 10 ratings this movie has gotten. In a database that has Pulp Fiction and The Godfather I & II at 8.1 to 8.7 just who is giving this time waster anything above a 5??",The Darkest Minds

Don't watch if you know what a real movie used to look like!,1,4 January 2019,"Every time I watch such overhyped, overrated and so often reviewed movies, I have to think about the times when real movies were made. The times that movies like Cinema Paradiso were pieces of art which moved human feelings and emotions altogether.
What you expect from this movie: a teeny version of the X-men based on the trailer with lots of teeny action and CGI.
What you get to see: another horrible version of ""The Hunger Games"" with an artificial love story, like the one in ""The Hobbit"". The director wants you to believe in it, but you simply struggle to do so.
The acting is horrible too. I know there are just a bunch of kids, but I've seen other kids playing fantastic roles in other movies. There was a moment during the movie that I wanted to look how old the director is. I really thought for one sec that she is also a teeny!

And you can tell it was I spired and not complete since the sorry arcs and the relationships you can tell they are there but more rushed then what the viewer would expect which i'm sure the book probably would of let it grow a bit more. I gave it a 7 because the story is interesting enough. And the other books hopefully explore this world and expand on it. And show where the characters are in life. Since they are scattered and to explore the league. Would if gave it higher if they developed characters a bit more. Unfortunately I did find many things to to be predictable. I saw it coming. Only thing it wouldn't of expected was the guy taken advantage of her. Also some of the things discussed. To my understanding she's 16 and discovers her powers at the age of ten. So there was a desease i would say 6-7 years ago. And all she would know is what she learned the first 9-10 years. But they seem to know more about what the world was like before then I feel they should. Sure they aren't dumb but certain things shouldn't be so reliant to people who were in an internment camp for 6 years and another who was part of a refugee camp. Do over all nice isn't bad and isn't perfect. But with Harry Potter lord of the rings and hunger games ,etc money they can make the run time longer. I'm sure game of thrones series way will tell the story best but there's a story needing to be told Hope they re visit the series and don't end it with out completing the story like the maze runner, beautiful creatures.

125,sterhill-1,Terrible from Book to Movie Attempt,1,6 August 2018,"I read the books, all three of them. The first one was riveting. The concept of teens getting ""powers"" unexpectedly and inexplicably is certainly not new. This idea shows up in a quite number of books and movies, but Alexandra Bracken does a nice job of pulling off. Her characters are believable and they get into some really desperate situations. The lead character, Ruby, is a very introspective girl who grows into being able to handle more than she ever thought she could. Nice growth there. By the third book (In the Afterlight) we are into Lifetime for Women and I had a hard time finishing.But the transition to the screen is flat, wooden and full of clichesSo far so good. Whoever did the casting for this movie? I can only assume he/she was paid under the table for his/her choices. Ruby was described as pale skinned - ( could see my pale face reflected in the stainless steel surfaces) and has green eyes (He leaned down a ways so our identical green eyes met) and (where my eyes were pale green) and long brown hair in a pony tail (His hair was the same shade as mine-deep brown). Her pony tail kept getting grabbed according to the books.So they cast a black girl with a big hair into this role? Now don't get me wrong. If a black actor is called for, cast a black actor. Chubby is frequently described as being black, in many different places throughout the books, described in many different hues and Vida is definitely Latina. Lots of other black people in these books. And Zu is definitely oriental - she mentions her mom wants to take them back to Japan. If you didn't have THREE books describing Ruby as white, it really would not matter.So why do you not cast Ruby as white?PLUS I just don't see Ruby's personality from the book to this actress. Do not see it. Different girls.Do not see the actor playing Liam (Harris Dickinson) as being 'unbelievably handsome"" which Bracken comments on frequently through all three books. Nice looking but not unbelievably handsome.This is a trilogy of books - like The Maze Runner or The Hunger Games - but I'd bet this never gets into making a second movie, let alone a third. I certainly hope so.",The Darkest Minds

It was like a teen love flick, with an entirely flat ending, so flat it was almost, well, flat, nothing. Superpowers?

The ending falls short because it's clear she was leaving it open & setting up for a sequel.

I hope she has a busy future ahead of her because I'm looking forward to seeing her again.Mandy Moore has second billing but she shows only for a few moments at the beginning and end. Also, Bradley Whitford has third billing and very few scenes. Not disappointed, it is a YA movie after all.I did not read the book or hear about it. The reason it took me so long to finally view the movie was because the tags were ""Action, Adventure, Drama"" with no sci-fi, so I wasn't really interested in watching a teen drama. Then I read the storyline (which is probably why I added it to my Watchlist) and finally watched the movie.The movie did feel a little rushed.

So first we are asked to believe that the virus can infect all kids and kill most of them and then give the survivors supernatural powers. That's a big ask. Then for some reason the economy collapses in six years when there are no kids. Why? And the adults take the survivors and lock them away in concentration camps for some unexplained reason. Why would adults do that? Considering at the species can only survive if these kids breed then why would you Lock them away and kill a lot of them?

173,kevinlemenager,Children at Risk,2,13 August 2018,"The Darkest Minds is basically just a blend of every YA cliché under the sun. In this day in age, Young Adult novels are all the rage. The same can be said for their movie adaptations. They either work (with every book in the series getting adapted) or they don't (one and done). The trailer for The Darkest Minds certainly peaked my interest. Most of the marketing pushed it as an X-Men style YA thriller. I didn't read the book, but the movie doesn't seem too different. The Darkest Minds centers on a girl named Ruby Daly (played by Rue from The Hunger Games). After an event wipes out most of the population's children. The only surviving children develop superpowers. Green - high intelligence, Blue - telekinesis, Gold - create electricity, Red - manipulate fire, Orange - mind control. These powers are shown when their eyes turn that color. Obviously Ruby is an Orange, and therefore dangerous, but misunderstood. She eventually winds up with a group of kids looking for some sort of safe haven. You're probably already picking up on all the clichés I mentioned. A young female protagonist, ""unique"" character names, factions, everything has a nickname, an evil government, a rebellion, a love triangle, you name it, it's probably there. I didn't really have confidence in the movie, but I showed minimal interest enough to go see it by myself.

Dividing kids into classes, also not to mention a little bit of Maze Runner with a virus. I've seen a lot of movies, and out of all of them this is the worst screenplay I've seen, even worse than Troll 2 which was A. a bad screenplay, and B. was written in English by Italians who butchered the screenplay even more.Just don't see this, because maybe it'll convince Hollywood that this trend is Dead.",The Darkest Minds

Like literally no one was around, not even adults or elders or pet?How did the kids manage to go and stay in the hotel if kids are basically wanted by the force or something? Did they use their power? Well I would have liked to see that cuz it was confusing.Not sure why the colour orange comes after the colour red? Like why? Red is supposed to be after orange. Also why is the orange colour so dangerous when the red people could literally shoot a large amount of fire from their mouth?? And control minds?? That to me looks more lethal than just controlling minds but ok.Also I feel like the focus of the movie went a bit missing along the journey: First the kids have to bring Ruby (the main lead) back to her family (which is weird as her family doesn't even remember her so...okeeeyy), then the focus was on finding the place with other kids like them, 'The safe place', then the focus was on the teenegers journey and being together as friends, then the focus suddenly turn into 'Romeo and Juliet' with the main lead suddenly falling in love after a FEW minutes with the other guy (forgot his name)?? Ruby came out of the room wearing a red dress out of the blue in front of him? Emh...ok lolDidn't get the villain tbh, it was confusing for me, is the League to be trusted? What's up with the other orange eyes guy? I mean it was cringe how he showed up and obviously sospicious since day 1. And what's up with the ending? Like whaat just happened? Why Ruby decided to cancel the guy's memories of her?? What if the guy remembers her? Like bad things will happen? No idea lol plus why just him and not the other two friends?? Feels like they have been forgotten also why is the guy, after forgetting everything that just happened, running into the woods like that lol? And the music? Sounded like a Nike commercial to me lolOverall the movie was not atrocious but it was bad.

It is an interesting concept with likeable characters. Now, my nitpicks. The lowest power level is just enhanced intelligence. Why would they be locked up? Wouldn't they be better used to achieve scientific advancement? The movie explains that the economy tanked and most people moved to the big cities. Wouldn't the opposite be true? In order to survive, people would go to farming/ranching. The ending of the movie is clearly trying to set up a sequel.

223,lizzybella,Wasn't bad but wasn't great,6,30 April 2019,"I saw this movie show up on HBO and had some time to kill before bed. Story plot sounded interesting enough so figured why not. It opens up pretty good but found it to get pretty bland in the middle. Kids with powers and adults who want to use them for personal gain or kill them if too strong. Of course the kids just want to be kids. There's the good adults and the bad. There's a cute little love story and betrayal by one of their own. Then mix in some fight scenes to show off there powers and you have a movie. From what I read this was originally a trilogy of YA books and they left the end open to continue the story. This is nothing I'd run to the theaters to pay and see. But I would blow a couple hours if it happens to show up again on HBO, Showtime and so on. It feels like this type of story has been done kinda like a combo of X-Men, Hunger Games and Maze Runner. Also acting was pretty decent so that helped push this from the 5 I would of gave it.",The Darkest Minds

Barely any time for you to feel comfortable with the characters, they are empty shells. The romance between 2 of the main protagonists is rushed and forced and the end doesn't help at all as I've seen plenty people saying.

I returned the book, eventually I thought I'd try to give and got the audiobook from the library Thinking of a movie if it's coming out maybe I should try it again. To the same thing I just could not get to the back I was just so bored and I could not keep my focus. So because I couldn't get through the book I didn't watch the movie until now. Now I do you want to go back and get the book again. And read the following just because how much this movie drew me in to the story. I am interested in the characters and their background.

Well, it's watchable...but I wouldn't say it's an amazing film or whatever. Unfortunately, for me, it didn't really seem that much happened? Once the main character met up with others like herself (with abilities), I really thought the film would pick up and give us some excitement. But that didn't happen. Then we are given about five minutes worth of fighting and explosions...and that's about it. It just feels like they maybe stretched out what might happen in a 40 minute tv show episode and turned it into a film...which doesn't really work all that well. 
With the ending of the film, it's obvious to see that they've set it up for a sequel, or two, but it didn't really grip me and make me want to see the next one. But who knows, the trailer for the sequel might also mislead me like the trailer for this one. 
I will say to watch it if you want to, and then form your own opinion of it.

Watched the movie with the onset of being disappointed because of the low rating and was amazingly so surprised.

And hey like I'm pretty into dystopian future movies like The hunger games and divergent but this was just a no. The lines were just stupid, the jokes that were told to lighten the mood fall pretty flat. Also the explanation of things in the movie don't makes sense, it's almost as if there should be a prequel to this movie. If there's supposed to be a prequel, I don't want to see it......... it's too late. Please don't make another one of these movies I beg of you. If you want to see it, just wait until it's free online and if you like it buy it on DVD. Don't waste your money.

There was nothing original about this movie, simply put it was xmen merged with hunger games and divergent. The acting was really bad, the directing was superbad, the story was so underwhelming that it didn't have any kind of progression especially for the characters. The script was ultra bad and the ""romance"" was at least infinitly cringe worthy (like anyone wants to see a relationship between a 10 years old amd a teen). The scenes where put together in the most incoherent way and the whole story was clearly just a set up for the sequel which made me laugh cuz there is no way that this thing is going to get a sequel. If you watch the movie you'll see that the whole thing is just one big filler episode.
Pros:

258,hugogomes9665,What makes The Darkest Minds the most uninteresting movie of this season?,3,23 December 2020,"First, the concept that transpires to a X-Men wannabe with young prodigies and various powers to take care of the umpteenth dystopic theme. Secondly, the inspiration for young adult's sagas of this nature (four books by Alexandra Bracken), and in this ""little world"" the effect deja vu of the factions, the divisions and, finally, the megalomaniac villains who have influence on militarization and the political sphere.Lastly, in order to thicken this whole myopic vision of entertainment for the younger generation (Hollywood is to blame in the notary's office for persisting in yawning matters in the industry), it is a kind of ""adultphobia"" with young people taking, inconsequently, roles or figures of maturity in a war between age groups. Prevalence of these symptoms of resources spent for the vacuum of creativity, where one could at least stress the good employed technical and narrative rigor. Let's see, if in technique this The Darkest Minds is above the tedious competence (again the pat on the back and the ""good job!"" of this life), in narrative is the same over and over again.To standardize films and audiences before the puerility of the characters, relationships and situations, so that in the end there is no sense of loss, consequence, or political-social criticism (in this branch, The Hunger Games obviously went out to win). And speaking of the Hunger Games, the protagonist - Amanda Stenberg - finds herself again stuck in this kind of production (we remember her was Rue).

All in all it feels like the movie is late to the Maze Runner / Hunger Games / Divergent party. The big ""plot twist"" in the movie is extremely obvious all the way through the ""buildup"" (if you can even call it a buildup), and the movie has a lot of plot holes.

Ruby touches people and can see things that they've done, but throughout 25 minutes of her touching and training with the main villain, she see's nothing. She constantly talks about how she can't control her powers while actively using them. She made a bounty hunter walk into a forest, to die, by putting thoughts into her head. Then 5 minutes later says she can't put thoughts in peoples heads. In the final fight scene, the helicopter pilot just happens to make eye contact with Ruby, by zooming in through a binocular, from a mile in the air... While piloting the ship?

Just expected a bit more. I love the books.",The Darkest Minds

284,jacobminh,Not as bad as it sounds,7,5 August 2018,"I saw the movie with my friends (3 of us in total) and we all loved it. (Even hoped for a sequel in the near future!) Yes, the screenplay is pretty similar to all the now-dead YA trends. The lines and dialogues are quite predictable. The acting, however, is quite good for the new and young generation. Reviewers tend to leave out the acting of the actors and actresses and only focus on the dialogues, which is unfair. Despite the commons, you must admit the movie has its own spices in the genre. A lot of people reviewed it too harshly in my opinion. I haven't read the book myself. But after seeing the movie, I made up my mind to definitely pick it up from the bookshop so this must say something about the movie. Overall, the movie, as usual, has its ups and downs, but definitely worthed every single minute and pences I spent.",The Darkest Minds

A movie to watch after lunch on sunday with kids.",The Darkest Minds
291,laurenramey-56243,I would rate it 0 if I could,1,2 August 2018,"This movie is kind of like Percy Jackson, just because it barley follows the book. Let's see here. 1. Ruby Daly in the book is described with pale skin, light green eyes and long tangled dark brown hair. The actress has curly short brown hair with brown skin and brown eyes. If that's how her character were described in the book I wouldn't have anything. Against it. 2. ZU has short dark hair while in the movie she has long hair. There's a reason for it and a story behind it! 3. One of my big things, CHARLES IS A BLUE. He's not a green, just because he's smarter than the average teenager does NOT mean he's a green in any way, shape, or form. 
4. Clancy Gray, portrayed by Patrick Gibson, would be perfect if he had black wavy hair. The only thing they got spot on in this movie is Lady Jane, Gwendoline Christie, because she fits the description perfectly. Honestly, the movie is so incorrect from the book and it sucks because this is my all time favorite book. Sometimes I really wish I was the casting director. Welp, don't trash this review to criticize me just for my opinion. Just really had to speak my mind on this matter.",The Darkest Minds

There's a lot of things to explore in the world that was created here and the soundtrack was great. Sure, it's not an Oscar winning film but you want to get behind the characters and really get to know them. Give it time to grow people and let them show us a good story.

294,richardmoes,Expectations (Spoiler alert),6,5 August 2018,"I went in this movie with surtain expectations, and some of them came true but there where a few mistakes i just can't except. One of the major mistakes is that Charles is blue in the books and not green, yes he was very smart but not green. Another is that Clancy never learnt the abilitie to erease somebody from a surtain mind.
I also misplaced a character, or atleast i think so... At the start of the book 1 ruby is not the onl orange that escapes, there was another boy (can't recal the name at this point) but he comes back later in book 2 with the leaghe. 
Besides this i found the movie quite fun to watch, at some point is was a bit fast compared to the book but that was to be expected. The story is strong, the characters are enjoyable and overall a good movie.
I do hope that if they are going to make a second movie, they pay a little bit more attention to the story line in the book.",The Darkest Minds

Some humor, romance, and action with an interesting plot. The cliffhanger at the end made me and all my friends so mad but it made me want to read the books. I definitely wish I knew about the books beforehand. I think they could have tried to advertise the movie more, because the trailer was really good I am so sad to hear it did not do well in the box office.

Those with powers being treated as less than human and being herded into camps and marked for execution and experiments? How is this not flat out copyright infringement?When The Hunger Games ripped off Battle Royale a dangerous precedent was set announcing to plagarists across America that unique ideas for storylines are fair game in this day and age and that stealing someone's work is very profitable.To me, plagiarism is an act worse than murder. An artist's life is temporary; art that an artist leaves behind is eternal and immortal. Plagiarism should be punishable by death, not rewarded with millions of dollars in movie ticket sales.I wish nothing but the worst to all people involved in stealing from Marvel's X-Men and the work of all of the people involved in bringing that world of mutants to life.

I recognized some of the cast (Mandy Moore from This Is Us and Amandla Stenberg from Hunger Games) so I figured I'd watch. Yes, it is similar to other YA movies, but so what? They remake Spiderman all the time and people still watch. This one is different enough to be entertaining and I hope there's another movie as I'd like more info about the how and why things happened.

Now I can understand that the ending would throw a lot of people and I can plainly see how the producers were really counting on there to be a sequel, and the movie by itself without the sequel does leave you wanting closure. However, the effects and storyline were very well created and performed. The Darkest Minds did underperform at the box office with them losing money, a good few million in fact, and this will most likely mean there's will not be a sequel but I do wish they could make a short or something that ""fixes"" or ""elaborates"" on the ending. In the end for me, I still think it was a absolutely wonderful movie. 10/10",The Darkest Minds
304,Momiki,Surprised by Negative the Reviews & Disappointed Hype for Movie is Lacking based on Famous Cast,9,12 May 2019,"This movie certainly deserves more credit than it received. I wacthed this movie on a whim, as it was listed as ""new"" on HBO. I knew nothing about the movie or the actors that I would be pleasantly surprised to see while watching.I am sad that I wasn't aware of the move back in late 2018 when it was released. I have not read the books, but based on this movie, I am craving for more. You do not need to read the books to enjoy this movie. I love that the movie was directed by female & has a strong female lead! Jennifer Yuh Nelson did a good job & I am pleased with it. Critics do not always get the reviews right, & this movie is no exception.I am a huge fan of Bradley Whitford (Watch Cabin in the Woods movie or West Wing series if you have NOT already). I enjoy Mandy Moore, Wade Williams (he plays very similar characters & IMHO well, as I tend to really dislike the character he portrays!) & Wallace Langham (early CSI episodes, I stopped watching after Graham left). Ok, side tracked...back to the current movie review...The movie left me with wanting more. If you enjoy sci-fi, young adult action (regardless if you are a young adult or older), I recommend that you check this movie out. Movie is a solid 9 out of 10. I enjoyed the plot, story line & experienced several different emotions while watching. I would love to see a sequel or a series on Netflix!

I had a great time, but I only have one remark about the ending .. Am I the only one to be completely disapointed of this clueless ending? Honestly, this""romantic story"" between the two main actors should not have ended like this ... It would have been much more logical and simpler to erase his negative memories of the League to convince Liam to stay with the ""League"" rather than to fade away from his spirit... In my opinion, there were a lot of better and less drastic solutions as an ending...

Even though I know how the story goes since I read the books, I felt as though I was someone who hasn't, yearning for the knowledge of what happens next. Also, I think the cast portrayed the characters really well.
PLEASE renew the films and make a 2nd movie! I don't know about other people, but if I hadn't read the books it would drive me crazy wondering what happens.

When I watched the trailer I had already realized things were left out but I know that they can't fit a whole book into a movie. BUT there were so many important things left out or just changed. I can understand leaving somethings out to fit a timeline but changing certain parts of a story shouldn't happen. I liked the cast of main characters and believe that they acted very well but I was mad almost the whole movie,The Darkest Minds
315,kristinachuhnova,As for me the best film about super powers,9,27 September 2020,"The film was released in 2018.The genres of this film are adventure and fantasy.Plot tells about a strange desease .Children began to get sick and die,but those who survived either grew wiser (they had green eyes),or they survived telekinesis(they had blue eyes),or manage electricity(they had yellow eyes) and the last most dangerous were red and orange.Government was afraid of them.They crated camp and placed children there.But there was a girl.Her name was Ruby. She was orange but hid it because like her were killed.Then government learned that she was orange.Thay wanted to kill her but she could run away.
I really loved this film.Special effects are amazing.When you watch this film you want to have super abilities.Actors played there part great. I really liked the appearance of the main character.
But there is one thing that i did not like.This is the end of the movie.I expected more.I thought that Ruby and LIam would be together,but probably she did better for him that she let him go.",The Darkest Minds
316,torahdavies,Mixed Reviews,9,7 October 2020,"I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews here, some people love it, and some people hate it, so let me lay it out for you. A lot of people are saying that it's nothing new, and is similar to Hunger Games, Divergent etc. but if you like that genre, you'll like this movie. If you are a person who watches movies to analyze and critique everything, which is fine if that's your style, then you probably won't be a fan. The character development might not be up to your standard or maybe you'll find the plot weak and that's ok, all though the videography and effects are excellent. But if you just want a fun exciting story, with pretty good acting, a cute love story and some really funny and badass moments, then this is a great movie. It's entertaining, emotional, and perfect if you love action and superpowers. I was a fan of this movie, and I hope that there will be a sequel. On a side note, the movie is based on a book which is part of a 4-book series, which I found to be well-written and enjoyable, so if you're looking for something to read, check it out.",The Darkest Minds

324,michaelstone-2,Good start to a series. 8/10,8,8 August 2018,"Don't let the low rating fool you. It's a great start to a series.
The Darkest Minds has a similar feel to the Divergent series. If you enjoy Fantasy/SciFi series like Divergent, Twilight, The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and the like, then you'll feel at home with The Darkest Minds as well. The story can be summed up initially by a conflict between people with abilities and those without. The government hunts down kids with abilities (which is mentioned in the first 2 minutes of the movie). There is a twist, but watch it for yourself to see what I mean. The main cast is young (kids and teens), but that's to be expected from a series like this one - just like with the above mentioned titles. Just know what you're getting yourself into, and don't expect something else. It's exactly that; a Fantasy/SciFi/teenDrama/Romance. The entire production is well executed by the way. There's nothing cheap about this movie. From the story, to special effects, to acting, to cinematography, etc. Everything is well done. The Darkest Minds will for sure get several installments, and I personally can't wait for the sequel. Anyways, I'm recommending this to anyone who likes the titles I mentioned in the paragraph above. It's time well spent. 8/10",The Darkest Minds

326,fallen_angel_kizmet-994-807090,It's watchable,5,17 August 2018,"This basically sums up every movie I've seen in recent years almost. Supposedly this movie was based off a book series. I don't really want to go too much into this, but a lot of this movie was world building. The filmmakers clearly made this movie so it would pick up for a sequel, but I doubt that movie will be made. There's way too much going on in this movie that it's barely explained and poorly executed. The premise is some post apocalyptic future where kids are being born with superpowers like X Men, so the military is trying to capture them all and experiment/exterminate (it was never made clear) them like Weapon X from the X men. We know there's this ""League"" or something like the Justice League from the Justice League. I had no idea where the movie was going, where the story was going, there was no peril, no objective, no goals, and no real consistency. The dialogue was corny in many areas, and I honestly think this is just some cheesy teen romance that doesn't do anything for the plot with a post apocalyptic mutant super hero story thrown in.

332,been2,Not impressed,6,9 November 2018,"First off, I read the book. So I know what was cut and what actually made it into this film.
This film felt like they took all that made said book a realistic, dark dystopia and soft-washed it until it was nice enough to be seen by younger kids. (I'm surprised it didn't pass for FSK 6, to be exact) That and a script and story-board that apparently took simply the biggest events of the book directly without context, all while cutting or minimizing the more brutal elements to said events. Is it a wonder the film isn't particularly good? Also, all relationships felt more or less fake and instant. Which was probably because the film cut any of the slower moments between the main cast of characters and didn't add in a collage where they actually all learned to approach and like each other. The main cast met, as strangers, and was instantly best-friends-forever within few minutes, with the exception of Chaps, who was charmed a minute or two later.The actors are all good (more or less in case of some side characters and Liam, who wasn't at all convincing) and I adore that main lead Ruby was played by such a stunning bi-racial african girl. She was also easily the best actor in the whole film. It fit so good and was a great decision. Absolutely made the film better, in my opinion.tldr; Overall, suffered from 1:1 adaption with too much cutting of the parts that made the book interesting. Think of Tribute of Panem, but anything that was actually dark or realistic in said movies was cut. That's ""The Darkest Minds"". Pity.",The Darkest Minds

345,robbert-613-813170,Ridiculous,2,30 October 2018,"I was constantly wondering whether I missed a few scenes... I didn't know there were ""Darkest Minds"" - books, before watching this movie. But apparantly there are. A film however should be a film and should not be a series of snippets from bookpages. That's how this movie feels. It's not possible to watch this without constantly wondering whether you have the complete version. Or whether someone is playing a practical joke, by just removing essential parts of the film.
Maybe the Director's Cut is a 3h masterpiece. But this movie just isn't. Two stars for special effects and camera work, which are pretty sweet. But this storyline. Just ridiculous.",The Darkest Minds
346,thaforc3,"This is an honest, captivating film. A solid 7",10,20 January 2019,When i saw this film the imdb rating was down to 5.6 For me this was not a fair score for this pic. That's why I rated it with a ten in attempt to bring the score up. It's in the genre of the Hunger games and Divergent. With this exception that in this movie i actually cared what happened to the main characters cause the actors are great. Good movie to see with your pre teen.,The Darkest Minds
347,jezamiah-703-300202,Just all round poor,4,11 August 2018,It's not the worst movie you'll ever see and I'd add that I haven't read the book either.The worst thing that turns me off this movie is the WRITING. I don't think I've watched a film that tried to squeeze in as many tropes and cliche one liners as this movie. I honestly sat there thinking I could have done a better job. Easily some of the worst dialogue in films out this year.Second thing about the movie was the ACTING. There were at best 2/3 good actors in the film but apart from that it was just poor for the most part. No character is charismatic and the emotion is so forced it's kinda painful to watch. I know they're young actors and in some cases kids but it felt like they had no direction and just had a free reign on what to do on scenes.A lot of shots and angles used were either unflattering or confused the viewer in various scenes and without going into spoilers there are few plot points that are just left unsolved that leave you questioning more. Perhaps they were hoping for a sequel but I doubt that will happen.A positive would be the CGI that made the powers look pretty legit but that's really as good as it gets. I'm curious as to whether the film was true to the source material or whether the script killed the movie.,The Darkest Minds
348,zeynepsertyel-728-391628,It was fine,7,13 August 2018,I think they did a pretty good job. Sure it wasn't revolutionary good or didn't show anything we haven't seen but it was good on it's own. And They made me want more.,The Darkest Minds
349,mariana_ladeiro,Rushed and confusing,4,21 August 2018,"I was super disappointed at this. I knew right on the firsts scenes I had wasted money. How come use one of the most emotional parts of the book right in the beginning??? The movie felt very rushed, the camp didn't have any impact compared to the book and it always felt like some scenes were missing. Characters... even worst. We didn't see any development and in no part whatsoever did I feel empathy for any of the characters. Literally the only part I liked and didn't laugh my ass off was the last scene where Ruby and Liam are talking. Besides that, I don't even remember the film well enough to talk about it more.",The Darkest Minds

355,IsabelB50,"Great Movie, Suffers from Book-Turned-to Movie Syndrome",8,5 January 2019,"This is a great movie overall! I really enjoyed it. There are just a couple things that I felt we're left out: 1) why would the reds let themselves be turned into weapons got the government? Do they not have free will or are they just straight monsters? 2) How could kids be suspected of being trappers? In the mall scene they were being messed with because they ""could've been trappers"", but the guys who were messing with them would've seen that they were kids...idk. And 3) When the group was leaving the hotel, what happened between Ruby and the adult couple? Why did they leave them alone? I do see that this is also a book so these questions are probably answered in the book and they're only left behind in the movie as a result of squeezing a book into a movie. Another thing I didn't like about it was how they made Lady Jane to be a huge villain, but she only ended up being in 2 scenes: her intro scene and her exit scene. The way that she was bring described sounded like she would be the villain throughout the whole book. The only other problem I had with it was that the romance between Ruby and Liam escalated VERY quickly, which again, could be the result of the book-turned-movie thing. Other than that, it was awesome. Great story, great plot. Lots of twists. Would recommend.",The Darkest Minds

I went into this movie blind and I got to say it surprised the hell out of me. lthought it was going to be some sad movie that was going to try to be the next beginning of the hunger games, but it wasn't it was actually a enjoyable fun filled movie that actually made me feel something at the end.

Also I forgot half the character's names, sorry. When I say it's like The 5th Wave, that isn't a good thing to me. Granted AS had more chemistry with the love interest than CGM did in The 5th Wave, but still. It was so badly done I just can't give it a good review even if I want to.There is next to no actual story in this film. It's more like a set up for the sequels than an actual story of its own. Seriously, when anything in the film that SHOULD have been a huge tense moment, or something interesting and not romance related, it was quickly dealt with in a way that came across very flat and then it moved on. Was it supposed to be about the romance or the abilities and world it was set in? If it was supposed to be a romance a lot of gimmicks were used to try to make something happen to further that. A fancy red dress out of nowhere for no real apparent reason to be worn other than ""look at me I'm a hot chick"". OR the near kiss after she went home. Speaking of her going home, that was a missed opportunity for something interesting to happen. She got there, looked in a window, and left. Seriously, why was no one watching her house after she escaped? If she had gone in and her parents were waiting to trap her it would have been way more interesting than a 2 minute window stare and leave.The idea of who is the bad guys was all over the place, the camp people, Mandy Moore's character and friend, the actual bad guy in the end (Oh my gosh, the obvious lighting to make it look like Bradley Whitford had evil eyebrows from the shadows of his glasses at the beginning, just no), Gwendoline Christie. I mean come on, the evil ""Lady Jane"" spoken of in terror then sent off so easily. I know it was probably meant to show AS's power, but it didn't work. It just didn't have the powerful I should be scared of this girl moment. Then we get to the end. I called it, but it again fell so flat. I didn't want Liam's memories of her erased because it was too basic, too much like an easy way out. I've not read the book, and probably the book is better, it has to be. The problem is the film has to stand on its own without the book, and this one really doesn't.",The Darkest Minds

Being a fan of the book series, I was already excited for the film's release, but was nervous about the YA novel adaptation. However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can't be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next. My mom, who has never read the series, left the theater and said ""well, now I'm going to have to steal the second book from you and read it, because I can't wait until another movie to see what happens!""
Please, do not listen to the negative reviews, and go see this film for yourself. I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life.

It was much better than similar movies like Hunger Games, Divergent, or Maze Runner! This one actually makes sense as to why the children/teens are segregated and fighting against the establishment.",The Darkest Minds

I truly hope there will be a movie series as a result.",The Darkest Minds
417,info-08979,A teen movie for teens,6,12 August 2018,"Accompanied my daughter to see the film - she loved it. For me it was too heavy on the romance and action-lite. She said she preferred it that way. Maybe for her it was more 'human' this way instead of the powers taking central focus. It was well acted. The leads were excellent, emotional connection between the group was lovely. I'll see any sequels accompanying my daughter, I didn't fall asleep (as I've been known to do) so hopefully with the back story and plot more fleshed out the films will improve, but ...Good effort!",The Darkest Minds

420,dombro-17937,Awesome movie but hate the ending part,9,4 August 2018,This movie as awesome no doubt. The action and romance to it was just wow. I just hate how towards the end what Ruby did to Liam was messed up and made me sooo mad and cry historically. Cause she took out his memory of her and it broke my heart. But this needs to have another sequel to it. Cause I want to see the battle and see if Liam will fall for Ruby again... plus it's possible cause she didn't take memories away from chubbs of Zul so when they hopefully get reunited they will try to get them to come together again. But anything else was soo good and kept me in the movie. I was hoping it was 2 hours. It isn't the same as the book for something but don't get discouraged.,The Darkest Minds
421,lovelylivy,AMAZING,10,4 August 2018,This movie is so Fantastic. It is all and more then what I was expecting and I am in complete love with it. The cast and everyone in the production did an amazing job and I can't wait for movie 2.,The Darkest Minds

424,mariomcaceres,This movie is phenomenal! Don't believe the negativity,10,5 August 2018,"This was a great film adapted from a YA book series. The film jumps right into the action and then slows down a bit. The film also had a really interesting dynamic with the main character showing her as a child and then as a teenager. I do wish they would have developed her story a bit more but there are always future movies in the series that can focus on that. I do feel that this film might be better as an actual original series on Netflix. This can potentially make a great show! I would say I am definitely intrigued and would love to see more! The creators of this film did fail in the marketing of this movie as many haven't heard of it, also the release is poorly timed as the new mission impossible movie will be the box office giant for weeks to come, unfortunately as a result, the Darkest Minds numbers will suffer at the box office. This movie's ending sets up for another film in the series and I will pray that they decide to begin developing a second film. MESSAGE TO THE FILM'S DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS: CONSIDER A CONTRACT WITH NETFLIX, YOU ALREADY HAVE AN IN WITH STRANGER THINGS. Overall a fantastic movie!",The Darkest Minds

This movie is similar to other YA adaptions with strong characters, but also stands out with a unique plot line. It is action packed, romantic, uplifting, hopeful, and just made me smile! Even those who haven't read the book series understand and follow along! But if you haven't read the books I recommend them 12/10!",The Darkest Minds
427,Herabear,Amazing,10,5 August 2018,I thought this movie was great. The only part I disliked was how fast it moved along without minor details. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.

I don´t know why some people says the movie sucks, It´s not that bad, it has good special effects, is dynamic, tender and fun. As a fan of the books I know they can´t put everything in the movie but they put enough to make me smile when I left the movie theater. Don´t let the people´s opinion out there take your decision about the movie, just go to the theater, see the movie and make your own opinion. I think the movie deserves that chance",The Darkest Minds
430,dancygerj,Absolutely fantastic!!,10,5 August 2018,"This movie was amazing! It's unfortunate to see all the hate it's getting, but I assume most of the people criticizing it haven't even read the book. This movie is amazing, and is full of so many talented actors. I'd recommend actually reading the book so you can see this film for the masterpiece that it is.",The Darkest Minds

435,nicolate-62111,Fingers crossed for a sequel!,10,5 August 2018,I have been a huge fan of the book series for years. I have been highly anticipating the movie. I went in premiere day and I thought it was great! Like all book to movie adaptations there's some changes and some things left out but that's to be expected. I'm really hoping for the second book to be adapted too.,The Darkest Minds
436,rubyscaledonia,A film full of heart,8,5 August 2018,"The movie will definitely please the fans of the book, but thankfully it's not a requirement to read the book to enjoy/understand the story and its world. TDM has a wonderful cast of actors who fully embody their roles, and the love interest (Liam) doesn't fall into the usual line of creepy, over-controlling male leads trope (boys who actually respect girls and respect their power/independence? Who knew?). Some of the jokes/moments fell flat for me, and some parts were cheesy, but the core of the film is a group of scared kids finding a home and solace within one another - and it definitely delivers in that regard. The ending is bittersweet, so I certainly hope a sequel is in the works to follow up on the loose ends.",The Darkest Minds
437,pamelita-05621,One of the best book adaptations I've ever seen - don't listen to the bitter old critics,10,6 August 2018,"I truly enjoyed watching this movie. With utmost confidence, I say that this is one of the best adaptations - it was very faithful, to the books, albeit a couple changes here and there that I really didn't mind. I know many ""top"" critics are giving this movie poor reviews, but I promise you, do! not! listen! to! them! The critics are mostly +30 old men who already seem to have something against YA dystopian literature, so I doubt they gave this movie a fair shot and with an open mind. They are not the target audience, so I believe their reviews are not representative of the movie because they cannot actually relate to what happens (within the movie). You can even see the evidence of this in Rotten Tomatoes - the ""Tomatometer"" thing scored an 18%, but the audience score is 83% (the audience being the actual target demographic).I am a huge fan of the book series and I really enjoyed watching it (I'm also the target demographic, being a fan of YA literature). It was everything I ever could have wanted. The scenes were exactly as I had pictures them in my head. The bond between the characters made me care for them in a way that many other YA dystopian films failed to do. The actors were phenomenal and were perfectly cast to play the characters. The concept may be considered a bit cliché (being a dystopian world), but that does not take away from the uniqueness of this series. Many movies are done to death and cliché, but people still like them and find unique qualities in them (coughcough Marvel and superhero-fights-villian coughcough). So why not do that with this movie? I believe writing it off as a copy or rip-off X-men or Hunger Games or whatever else is frankly lazy and bs. It was a little fast paced at times and there were a tiny awkward moments here and there (however, the movie is centered around teenagers, so of course, realistically, there are gonna be awkward moments), but nothing that really distracted me from enjoying the film as a whole. I really urge you to go and watch this film. Not only is it very important for book fans (this book is a series, so we of course want it to be complete), but it is also very important because this movie demonstrates a lot of diversity. The director is an Asian woman, 3/4 of the main cast are POC (black, black and non-binary and asian). We always say that we want more diversity and inclusiveness - this movie is it. Support it! Show the movie industry that we actually want inclusiveness, and we are not just talk!",The Darkest Minds
438,allisoncollins-48027,AMAZING!,10,6 August 2018,I read The Darkest Minds years ago and I fell in love! I thought the movie followed the books really well and I really hope it gets a sequel!

442,krissystokesxx,fantastic!,10,6 August 2018,"Lots of people are comparing this story to the x-men. Yes, the children do have powers but this story is so much more than what they can do. This story shows how young people have the ability to use the voices and change their future, much like current times. Another thing that people aren't talking about is that this movie is of the few directed by a women this summer, have a main cast of 3 poc and the author is also a women. Supporting this movie is so important. There also so many reviews by old men who claim this is just another teen dystopian. Not many young adults agree that its like the hunger games or divergent, its only those who don't fully understand the world of dystopia. TDM is also highly focused on character developments that are wildly explored in the next 2 books. Finally, lots of people are leaving negative reviews online but if you search TDM or social networks such as twitter, instagram and Tumblr you can see how much people genuinely loved the movie and that they disagree with all these negative reviews",The Darkest Minds
443,snlinvestor,Great storyline. Really Good acting.,9,6 August 2018,"The young actors do a great job in this movie. Storyline is unique in some ways. Very cool how you get to hear the backstory on the main characters in this first part of what could become a new series. It's quite obvious that there will be a part 2, which apparently made some people rate the movie low but to me part 2 is justified as you do learn very much about the history of each character, or at least most of them. This movie has both High emotions and action",The Darkest Minds

This movie was kick ass without straying too far from the plot of the book. I loved it and many of my friends and I can't wait for a sequel, but it may not be possible with all of these bad reviews .

And then, i convinced my mother so go to the theatres to watch the movie. It was an absolute pleasure. Maybe it will remember The maze runner or The hunger games style but it is more than just a copy. The darkest minds talks about love and what you could do for it. It also really real. You won't see the girl cry for nothing. She doesn't want to get any trouble to anyone. It is a masterpiece and I'm tired of the bad criticals about the fact that is always the same. It is a incredible movie that deserves more attention.",The Darkest Minds
448,dewiparry-65754,"The Darkest Minds - Same Old, Same Old...",3,12 August 2018,"In the Darkest Minds, there is plenty that is confusing and therefore poorly set up. That is mostly down to the script and this has a direct effect on the quality of the performance by the actors; giving a lack of emotional direction or momentum to the plot. For example, A character briefly mentioned at the beginning of the film plays a pivotal role in its last scenes, but we don't have enough information or context relating to him for it to actually feel like a coherent surprise.  The film clearly establishes its target demographic but it seems every cinematic dystopia, particularly those aimed at younger audiences, are a mirror of one another. This results in the world feeling uninspired and the audience apathetic about the fate of the characters. 
Although the tragedy that is the romance between Amandla Stenberg's and Harris Dickinson's characters was a thought-provoking element in the film, it is nothing we haven't seen before.The plot felt like it was building to a much-needed finale which was not delivered, leaving room for a continuation on the story. However, depending on the success, this is probably the only theatrical release we will see from the franchise.",The Darkest Minds

453,tanyaittimeykin,This movie deserves better,10,16 August 2018,"It is really frustrating to me to see how poorly this film is doing and how negative critic reviews seem to be. The YA dystopian genre has more to offer than the Hunger Games and it's disappointing to see comparison take away from the beauty of these novels and this adaptation. The Darkest Minds was amazing. Amandla did a wonderful job portraying the complexities of their character and the supporting cast did a wonderful job of building this world. It was refreshing to see some representation for people of color on screen with 3 of the 4 main cast members and have their characters actually contribute meaningfully to the story. The special effects were pretty good given the budget, and the movie stayed pretty faithful to the books. I would definitely recommend giving this movie a chance.

Also to remember that kids have rights and what might be a small problem to you now think about you back then when you were their age. Sometimes you need to put your self in their shoes and in situation and then you might understand them better for who they are.

If not, just don't go and let us YA lovers enjoy this beautiful heart touching and revolutionary film -since it has two colour people and an asian as main characters, lead character is a woman and the director film as well, and kids start controlling their own path after suffering supression and isolation (like they are actually suffering in some countries)-

482,maylenapalluti,Make a part 2!!!!!,10,1 November 2018,"This movie was literally my favorite movie of all time. I'm a teen so I love he movie so much, I wish they could make a part 2. But my only problem was that I hated the part it left off cause I want more. I want to see what will happen to all the characters and how they will survive over again. So definitely consider making a part 2.",The Darkest Minds
483,lynnmb-54731,Great Movie,10,4 November 2018,Unsure why there are so many bad reviews. A mix between Hunger Games and X-men for kids. Thought it was delightful. Nice case as well. Looking forward to a part 2.,The Darkest Minds
484,tesslynnmitchell,Loved it!,10,4 November 2018,I loved it! I'm so hoping for a second movie! Im on the second book and the more i read the more i want the next movie to come out ughhhhh!,The Darkest Minds
485,ebolaislovely,clumsy and amateurish,3,6 November 2018,Good actors and shots brought down by bad directing and writing... the idea is poorly executed and it's a shame.,The Darkest Minds
486,mitchellmama,Awesome movie,10,8 November 2018,So good hope there is a sequel. Better than the bad reviews are giving,The Darkest Minds
487,pasrkow-50892,Special effects is fine but the movie is so unrealistic!,5,12 November 2018,"First and foremost 94% of the children died because of the mysterious disease and the government oppressed the remaining healthy youngsters? If a population has no youngsters, the entire civilization is doomed after 50 years. Civilization would recede due to lack of manpower.Also even if the president's son controls a few of governments higher ups, it wouldn't be logical for the entire country be controlled? A lot of politicians study demography so its impossible. Also, who would give their precious children to the government when after the 96% died already? Wouldn't the parents treasure there kids more?Also acting was a bit off at times but forgivable.",The Darkest Minds
488,valeriecarl,I adored this movie!,9,14 November 2018,This movie is so under rated it's ridiculous! Amanda Stenberg was perfect for this role. This movie is a cross between Hunger Games and X-Men. It would be a shame for anyone to miss this Dystopian movie. It will be EXTREMELY disappointing if they do not follow through with a sequel. One of the better movies to come out in a while.,The Darkest Minds
489,oliviajaye,Great for Teens,7,21 November 2018,"I recently watched The Darkest Minds and loved it! The acting was good and it made me cry at the end. There were some issues, such as an anticlimactic storyline and a lot of predictability, but it was nothing bad. I highly recommend this to young adults that love movies about dystopian futures. If you ignore the tiny issues in the plot, it is an amazing movie.",The Darkest Minds
490,naztorollrain,It is a good movie,10,1 January 2019,I enjoyed this movie. The actors/actress did an amazing job especially Zu. She is so cute!,The Darkest Minds
491,alishia-38749,AMAZING!! Please do a second movie!!!,10,24 December 2018,"This movie was AMAZING!!! If you like Divergent and the hunger games, they you will definitely like this!! The ending leaves us needing more!!! Please do a sequel!",The Darkest Minds
492,cecilyajohnsonboomer,This is a teen movie!!!,10,3 January 2019,If you are 45 and did not enjoy this movie I am sorry to say this but this movie was not made for your age group. This movie was made with a target age of teenagers!!!!,The Darkest Minds
493,yayinana,I can't wait for the sequel,10,12 January 2019,This was a great movie with talented young actors. I can't wait for darkest minds 2.,The Darkest Minds
494,fmadchi,I HAVE A QUESTIONS BUT NO ANSWERS !,10,26 January 2019,Personally I really liked it. It felt different from other movies out there. I liked the concept and the end had me tearing up. I really want to know what happens next and how the characters would evolve and grow. I feel like there are questions unanswered. Like whats Liams past in more details or what are the Leagues plans and are they really as bad as they Ruby was told? How did the disease actually come about? Was it man made? Does chubs get better? Id really love to see more.,The Darkest Minds
495,youmaf,Good First Part,8,27 January 2019,"I really liked this film, especially its novel-inspired script that allowed the creation of a fantastic story where teenagers are the heroes in a world where they are exiled because of their powers. The way to mix between all that is action and adventure and all that is emotional also pleased me, all that gave a big success of the film, and a general public which awaits a second part of the film .
The only thing that I did not like is the incomplete ending that still leaves many questions to the audience of the film but I think this open end is absolutely necessary for a sequel and a second part of the film.",The Darkest Minds
496,sonjakuzmanic,Loved it,10,23 February 2019,Loved it from the minute it started. And definitely deserved better ratings.,The Darkest Minds
