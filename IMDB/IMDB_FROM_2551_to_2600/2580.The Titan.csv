0,Leofwine_draca,Seen it all before,4,11 February 2019,"THE TITAN is a slow-moving, digital-looking fable about a family man who signs up to a new and exciting company bent on sending man into the far reaches of space; in order to facilitate this, the man agrees to undergo a series of genetic experiments designed to transform him into a super-human. What follows is a character study sadly mired in predictability and characters whom you don't really care about all that much. Sure, the effects and performances are okay, but there's really very little to sustain this other than meditations on identity, science and what it means to be a human being. We've seen it all before, and then some.",The Titan
1,SnoopyStyle,nothing,3,15 July 2018,"In the near future, the world is overcrowded and its resources are dwindling. A project headed by Professor Martin Collingwood (Tom Wilkinson) proposes to populate the Saturn moon Titan with genetically altered humans. Lieutenant Rick Janssen (Sam Worthington) has brought his wife Abigail (Taylor Schilling) and son Lucas. As the volunteers get altered, some are dying while others are showing volatile signs.Nothing happens for too long in this movie. Nothing ever happens behind Worthington's dead eyes. This could be a body horror but it does not do that. It really doesn't do much. I'm not a Worthington fan but I thought maybe Manhunt: Unabomber had given him new acting life. Sadly, this movie asks nothing of him and he gives them nothing. After his transformation, his alien face turns blank which is just as well. The emotional climax has no emotional content for him. This is a blank.",The Titan
2,nogodnomasters,Nature is unpredictable.,4,10 April 2018,"Sam Worthington has been in two Titan films and one where he changes to live on another planet in Avatar. This is clearing a type-cast and I also said he was miscast in those other features as he can not act. The earth has become over populated and climate change has wiped out the coastal regions and ruined farmland...the plan is population control and renewable energy? Nope too simple. Greening Mars and eating Matt Damon's feces potatoes? Nope, not appealing either. How about we force the evolution of man so he can live on Titan in the super cold, breathe nitrogen and drink liquid methane. Lt Rick Janssen (Sam Worthington), no relation to a famous fugitive, can live in the desert dry heat, so why not cold liquid methane...with a few shots? He is part of a test group that is supposed to go to Titan for 2 years (takes longer than that to get there) once they are altered in ""forced evolution."" The plot had too many holes in it for me to fully enjoy considering the characters were cardboard. Guide:F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Titan
3,kosmasp,Aquaman,7,19 January 2021,"I don't know why, but watching this I couldn't stop thinking about Sputnik. Don't get me wrong those movies are quite different ... and yet I feel they have a connection (if you'll excuse the pun) and have a similar flow or feeling to them. I guess I liked Sputnik a little bit more, but this isn't too bad either. But always considering that I do like Science Fiction and I have been accused of being to nice to movies - plenty of times.In this case the story is predictable and you shouldn't be surprised too much by the twists. Sam Worthington plays it straight and this also has one of my personal favorite characters/actresses from GoT. That's just me of course ... and I was hoping she'd win that underwater ""match"" against our main character. But that's another side note. It's a decent effort and I guess a bit of a criticism of military and society to a degree. You can read a few things into this",The Titan
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Started off so well, then I don't know what happened.",4,2 December 2018,"I was so intrigued to watch this movie, the trailer I saw made the film look awesome. The first twenty minutes or so I really enjoyed. I got into it immediately, the acting was really rather good, the story very interesting, but something seems to change, it's almost as if they switched directors or writers, as the film just turns into a real mess, it was hard to follow, almost every character was hard to like, and you find yourself asking 'what's the point.'I'll applaud the acting, and special effects, the latter in particular were great, but overall there was just something about it that I didn't like, if I'm honest I was bored.What was he going to do on his own on that planet?Mehhh. 4/10",The Titan
5,paul_haakonsen,"Putting the stars into man, not man into the stars...",5,6 August 2018,"I had not heard about ""The Titan"" prior to finding it and sitting down to watch it. But it had Sam Worthington on the cast list, and reading through the synopsis made it seem like it could be a Sci-Fi thriller with potential.And the movie definitely had potential, as writers Max Hurwitz and Arash Amel definitely had come up with an original idea for sure, and director Lennart Ruff brought that vision to life on the screen quite well. However, the whole direction of the movie just faltered and shattered to pieces about two-thirds into the movie, after the transformation to Homo Titanies had been complete.The director, Lennart Ruff, did a great job in building up the movie, adding more and more mystique and suspense to it, as the story progressed. But then the entire house came crashing down two-thirds way into the movie. It was just such a ridiculous turn to take.What worked out quite well in favor of the movie was the special effects. Color me impressed. The special effects team definitely worked a certain bodypart off to make the transformation from human to modified human come to life on the screen. And it looked wonderful and realistic. I was so impressed with that, and the special effects were so vital for the movie.""The Titan"" also had a fairly good ensemble of actors and actresses. Sam Worthington was quite nicely cast for the lead. But also the performances of Taylor Schilling and Tom Wilkinson really boosted the movie quite well.While ""The Titan"" is hardly the type of movie that you will watch more than once, it definitely is one that is worth taking the time to sit down and watch if you enjoy a Sci-Fi without all the lasers and space opera.However, my rating lands on five out of ten stars solely because of the last third part of the movie, as it was just blatantly and downright ridiculous. The rest of the movie was so great, but that last third was just a slap in the face to the audience.",The Titan
6,CinemaSerf,More a minnow than a titan...,5,10 May 2020,"I'm afraid I rather lost the plot near the beginning when ""Prof. Collingwood"" (a truly non-menacing Tom Wilkinson) appeared - at least not brandishing a mid-Atlantic drawl - as a scientist recruiting folks for a species-saving trip to Titan where mankind might have a future (having finally managed to trash the Earth, good and proper). Sam Worthington is ""Rick"" - the outstanding candidate and once the core of an elite team is formed, it becomes all to clear that there is much more of a sinister agenda to the Professor than initially met the eye. The film actually moves along well and the effects, such as they are, serve the plot well - but that plot is a meandering ramble of a thing; the cast don't really work together or with the audience to develop anything more than a shallow hybrid of ""the Shape of Water"" and ""Avatar"". Pity; could have delivered quite a bit more...",The Titan

Rick is is one of a number of volunteers with proven survival abilities who are to be modified to be able to live on Saturn's moon Titan. Unfortunately, the modifications turn out to have side effects.The synopsis made this sound like a good scifi drama. It turns out to be a body dysmorphism horror story with a big chunk of science vs the military vs big business vs ordinary people chucked in. The opening section is dull. Lots happens near the end, much of which makes no sense at all.This is a film like Prometheus. It stinks of cleverdickery. The filmmakers are so convinced of their own smug cleverness that they fail to take a step backwards to see that their cleverness needs to be based on something which actually makes sense (or, at least, doesn't make no sense).Don't waste time watching this.",The Titan
8,bombersflyup,That wasn't in the brochure.,3,5 December 2019,"The Titan is fine while it's building, but ultimately doesn't offer much.Why did the Game of Thrones girl kill her husband, just no reason. Why did Rick kill all the military? These are people like himself just doing their job... is this the way to go about it, both Rick and wife choose this path. Why was he required to lose his memory and then not required... I don't see how this ending changes much. He looks like the snakeman from ""Sssssss (1973)."" The acting's fine for the most part, the problem's the main character and the star actor Worthington after his transition's no longer able to impact the film, because he's unable to talk or evoke.",The Titan
9,siderite,"Insipid, derivative and unprofessional",5,8 June 2018,"I like Sam Worthington, despite him playing in a lot of crappy movies. But he goes to work and does his job well. Tom Wilkinson doesn't need any introduction or comment from me, he is the only titan in the movie. However, all the rest of the attributes of the film, including acting of the others, direction, pacing, story, script, special effects are simply... insipid. It's not that they are bad, although some are, as they are just meaningless. You watch the film and have no idea what it is trying to say. And it's no wonder, as this is directed by a first time director of a full movie, written by the first writer of a full movie in cooperation with his senior, who wrote two more, but more likely acted like a producer only. Now, I am not just being mean here. There are people who explode into art with no prior experience and just blow our minds. Alas, it was not the case here.I will go quickly over the fact that while Sam Worthington's character does go to another planet and turns blue, the film has a Titan in the title and it's filmed in the Canary Islands, which is funny, but leads to no story connection to Wrath of the Titans or Avatar. The film is just sloppy. There is a line (repeated twice as a science fact) saying nitrogen can be used to make oxygen, the science is ludicrous, the premise is ridiculous, the army and science logistics are off, the people have no chemistry, there are numerous plot holes and the story makes no sense. It tries for a slow and broody mood, but it does nothing else. You literally wait till the end of the film to see something happening, and then it all ends in a whimper. Oh, and while the film is preparing for the trip to Titan, there are literally three CGI scenes of it in the entire feature.I am sorry, there are just no redeeming qualities in this film. It's not even bad enough to get drunk and laugh your ass off at it. It's just bland and tasteless and a complete waste of time.",The Titan
10,Hellmant,"Mildly interesting, and amusing, but mostly just a bore.",7,6 April 2018,"'THE TITAN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A sci-fi thriller about a military experiment which turns an Air Force pilot into a super human, so he can survive on Saturn's moon (Titan), but he also has to deal with some severe side effects which threaten those close to him too. The film was directed by debut feature filmmaker Lennart Ruff, and it was written by Max Hurwitz (a debut feature screenwriter as well) and Arash Amel. The movie stars Sam Worthington, Taylor Schilling, Tom Wilkinson, Diego Boneta and Noah Jupe. It was released by Netflix through it's steaming site, and it's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics so far. I found it to be mildly interesting, and amusing, but mostly just a bore. Professor Martin Collingwood (Wilkinson) is working on a special military experiment that will hopefully save all of mankind from extinction. He's attempting to create a human being that can survive on Titan; for when Earth's resources have finally been depleted, and the planet is no longer livable (for humans). Air Force pilot Rick Janssen (Worthington) volunteers for the project, along with many others, but he's not prepared for the horrendous side effects that come with it. Neither is his wife (Schilling), and son (Jupe), who's lives are soon put at risk because of the experiment as well (along with many others). The movie has an interesting premise, some decent visuals, and adequate enough performances. It's just a little to dry, depressing and dull though. I also didn't care enough about any of the characters to feel involved in any of their (somewhat forced) drama. The climax is pretty cool though, and it's definitely not a bad film by any means (in my opinion).",The Titan
11,The-Sarkologist,A Waste of Energy,3,14 January 2019,"Honestly, should anybody be at all surprised that this film is really bad? Maybe we have somehow passed that stage where we have all forgotten about Tele-movies and straight to DVD releases, and as such when we watch something on Netflix, which is basically a Netflix production, we are somehow surprised that it actually isn't anywhere near as good as say a cinematic release. Honestly, probably not, though I am sort of wondering why it is that I ended up spending an hour and a half watching this load of rubbish. I guess it is one of my characteristics in that I simply am unable to turn off a film, and basically have to watch it through to the end, though of course I can sort of do other things if it does turn out to be incredibly boring.Well, that is what ended up happening here. Basically the film is set in the future where the world is suffering from an overpopulation crisis (which sounds pretty cliched mind you) and the leading scientists come up with this wonderful idea of colonising Titan. However, since the atmosphere of Titan is so hostile, they have to force evolve a group of humans to lead the charge. Yeah, you can probably see where this is heading, and the fact that it happens to be sci-fi horror really does put it in the boring category where I am concerned.Yep, this is the whole idea of manipulating human genes to make us stronger, and instead of making us stronger it actually results in us turning into monsters - except that we don't sort of. That is basically where the film falls down even further - there is no monster going out of control, killing everybody one by one, just some emotional claptrap where the last survivor is struggling to retain control of his humanity all the while becoming something that really isn't human.So, yeah, this film was pretty boring, and as others have suggested, that this hour and a half really has basically been wasted time that we will never get back. You know, people talk about how every cigarette results in us losing 11 minutes of our lives - well, every bad movie results in us losing an hour and a half to two hours of our lives.",The Titan
12,ops-52535,why not???,8,30 March 2018,"Ive seen worse,and ive seen better sience fiction dramas, but the evolutionary projects crystalized in the plot of this movie are really mindblasting,maybe far beyond recognition,or is it?i really start to wonder.
its well made,very structural and adventourus.but its also an undertone of utopianism,that it is an impossible possible to rapidify evolution.i wish my swim team could have had an injection of ''fly-kick'' vaccine,the underwater shots were just marvellous.

13,subxerogravity,"Very interesting concept, but not that interesting of a movie",5,17 June 2018,"I'm sure if I was to read this as a novel or a comic book I would feel different about the mundane story unraveling here. I don't know if it was a novel or a comic book first but I would not be surprised if it was and the filmmakers were thinking the same.So The Titan is about an unusual set of 'astronauts""willing to changed themselves genetically so that they can live on the moon of Saturn, but this is one of those ""science is well meaning, but goes horribly wrong"" stories.I like the story a lot and the idea of the story a lot, but I can easily see why it falls short. Not much is going on here past explaining the premise of the movie. Once that's over the parts were the ""astronauts"" train to become Titans is not compelling enough for me not to not let my mind wonder away from the movie. The only part that really kept me glued to the screen was Natalie Emmanuel whose in the Fast and the Furious movies. Then you had the parts in which the Titan's family was trying to deal with what's going on. The woman who plays Piper on Orange is the New Black plays the Titan's wife. I almost did not notice her without the blonde hair, but trying to figure out who she was is the only thing that kept me focus. They were trying to add in all the cliches of how a stressful job can effect family life without making it seem cliche and it did not work so well.Great idea for a Science fiction story that tries to be more Science than fiction, but I think they got the Science to jumbled along with the story for anyone to care that much. Nice effort though!",The Titan

15,TdSmth5,"Good concept, terrible execution",2,13 May 2018,"In the future, resources become scarce, there are riots and sandstorms in California. A family is being moved in a caravan to some NATO facility on the East Coast. They are placed in a mansion along a bunch of other identical mansions. We learn that the guy, Rick, was a soldier who got lost in Syria but survived. The wife, Abi, is a pediatrician. Soon they are visited by one professor Collingwood. And little by little we learn what all this is about. Rick is part of the Titan Program. He along with 20 others will be sent to Titan to explore the possibility of a human exodus over there. Yet they know very well that Titan is hardly suitable for live. So the astronauts will have to undergo procedures to alter their metabolism. They'll have to survive with little oxygen, their eyes will have to be able to see in the dark. So they subject them to dozens of injections, which do work, but of course also have side effects. Their veins start popping, they are turning very pale, they start shedding skin, and ultimately become violent. NATO itself has to start killing some of these guys off who attack their own families. By then Abi is tired of the lies and excuses and goes investigating into the professors lab and discovers that to alter the pioneers' metabolism, their DNA had to be altered. To what though? And that's the surprise here. When they do some procedure on the space travellers' eyes, they go blind and others have their eyes explode. So the professor decides that they all have to undergo some surgery. It's not clear what happens next but by then all but Rick and a girl survive and, well, they have been transformed.At this point, very late in the movie, it turns more into a family drama. The professor suggests that Rick has to undergo a chemical lobotomy to forget his past if he's going to make it on Titan. There is some back and forth about whether the family and a rogue scientist will protect him or whether the project will continue at all.The idea, while not new, is good. And it would have made a great sci-fi/horror/action thriller. They had the cast and the resources but instead filmed it, like so many movies and TV series these days, with a European flavor a I would say, that is devoid of any excitement whatsoever such that it became a dull sci-fi drama. They could have done a lot more with the twist but they didn't. Mind you, by the time 1 hour has gone by you wonder whether they will ever make it to Titan and if not, what's the point of this movie. And there really isn't one, aside from boring the audience.The Titan is a royally missed opportunity.",The Titan
16,robertemerald,Lack of faith in humanity ...,7,8 February 2019,"The current thinking in science circles is that Mankind must change his mind and body in order to space-travel. This is a movie about that. Tick. There is a cinematographic flair here (wonderful use of lighted swimming pools/overhead shots/night becoming day/etc). The look and feel is professional, and for most of the movie that's great. The actors are very likeable. Tick. The story itself I found let me down after the half way mark, and by then I had noted that if I wasn't a sci-fi buff then I'd probably be bored. Things happen, changes to people, injuries, but are not properly explained. This goes on for a while. Gradually bad guys emerge but one is left wondering why. The new baddies haven't actually lied to anyone or ripped anyone off. The last quarter is almost silent in its explanation. I felt action and drama was being invented without any logical premise or relevant back story to support it. If the message is 'Mankind isn't ready for this without a triumph from sacrifice' then perhaps it all makes sense. I think this was one of those sci-fi projections that would have been better done as documentary style. The Titan is a confusing movie where I'm not sure the end justifies the means.",The Titan
17,Rob_Taylor,"Well meaning, but ultimately hollow",6,30 March 2018,"The Titan is an exploration of what it is to be human and how far people are willing to change in order to further humanity's survival.Or at least, that was the original premise. The result slews away from that lofty aim in a somewhat predictable manner, offering us ""love will conquer all"" by the end. But only if it is true love. Out of all the candidates, only one retains enough of his humanity despite the changes he goes through and it is heavily implied that true love is the reason. His fellow candidates without love fall by the wayside. Those that have what they believe is love, also fall, usually hurting those around them in the process, until only our hero is left, because of his true love.I wouldn't normally decry this, but it is so heavy handed in its execution that it detracts from what otherwise was shaping up to be a good study of what makes us human.That said, the movie does hold your interest for the most part, and does keep you thinking for much of its run time. Where it lets itself down badly is in the rather crazy ending, where we see our hero finally transported to Titan and being lauded as the saviour of humanity. The final scene has him leap from a tall precipice and swoop around on laughably tiny skin flaps like a wannabee Superman. I haven't been so disappointed in an ending in a long time.Just what is one person, irrespective of his ability to survive on Titan naked, to do there? How is sending this miracle of science to Titan going to benefit mankind, whom the movie states early on have a limited time left to survive on Earth? What purpose does it solve?Now that I think about it some more, the entire premise fails to make sense. Instead of engineering a human to survive on a barren moon (they never do go into details about what he eats to maintain his biological functions) why not instead engineer humans that can survive on a dying Earth? You know, that planet that people already live on and which contains all the infrastructure you need to continue to force evolve the species to survival.When all is said and done, the movie decided at some point to throw away common sense and the exploration of humanity and focus on a human drama instead. For better or worse, it failed on all counts, though it remains a passable diversion on a rainy day. However, with a little more care, it could have been a really good movie. Sadly, we don't get to see that version.SUMMARY: Human drama with overtones of body horror and transhumanism. Not done particularly well and with the glaringly awful conceit that it would be better to evolve to survive on a barren moon than on a dying Earth. Not really recommended unless you are very bored.",The Titan
18,bettycjung,A sci-fi about using gene-editing to enable space travel,7,9 April 2018,"4/7/18. Actually I was surprised that this was pretty good for a sci-fi thriller. If you have a basic understanding of gene editing you will actually appreciate what this movie is trying to do, and that is to find a plausible application for gene editing that would enable space travel. Given that scientific studies have shown that space travel is detrimental to the human body as we know it, then why not change the human body to adapt to the challenges of space travel? This movie raises interesting questions about how the use of gene editing for a scientific endeavor, like space travel, can cause many ethical issues. Right now people are concerned about how gene editing can lead to designer babies, well, what happens if you can create designer astronauts? So, this movie is an example of how what is now seen as sci-fi can actually turn into scientific reality, with all its questionable outcomes. Worth watching.",The Titan
19,markthomassintek,"One simple question kept repeating in my mind as I watched this film, why?",5,10 April 2018,"REVIEW - THE TITANI'd never heard of this and after reading the synopses thought it may be interesting.Whilst the story is interesting and thought provoking, rather than changing a planet why not change the humans who inhabit it, this story is interesting in places but in others just drags along, whilst your waiting for something to happen, which it does but not to the extent that its promised.Unfortunately I just didn't care about the characters in this film, which was a shame because the whole story is very family orientated with the decision of the Titan which will affect the future of his wife and young son.One simple question kept repeating in my mind as I watched this film, why?Why would a happily married husband and father leave his family forever and how could his wife / partner allow him to do so with no option to ever see him again? This was the underlying reason why I just couldn't enjoy into the film as I felt this was unrealistic, which was a shame. If the Titan in question had been single, a criminal given the opportunity to, then maybe this film would have been enjoyable but the premise of the family man leaving forever just didn't ring true and spoilt the rest fo the film.Rating 5 out of 10",The Titan

22,kuarinofu,All points missed,5,2 June 2018,"The Titan is not a horrible movie, but it is very misdirected and focused on the wrong stuff.The beginning was quite engaging, but as the film progressed, I found myself less and less interested in what was going on. This mostly happened due to a severe lack of good characters and actual storyline.The guy (forgot his name, played by Worthington) was never established, so he didn't recieve any sort of actual character arc, because there was nothing to reference. By the end of the movie he just turns into a silent puppet. You have no choice but to percieve him as a lifeless robot (the fact that he doesn't talk helps a lot).The kid was just a plot device for basic motivation and not a real person. Futhermore, he didn't show any sort of emotion or acting in any of his scenes, so there's really nothing to discuss about him.The wife (seemingly the main character) actually showed some emotions and motivation until the last act of the movie, then it was all just thrown away.The first act was ok, then the movie loses your interest and the ending just throws random stuff at you. Never encountered this much ""WHAT?"" moments in one movie.There was so much they could've done with this movie, but they didn't. How about twisting his emotions? does he feel anything about pretty much becoming semi-god? They were probably trying to setp out from referencing another space adventure movies, like 2001.I rarely say this, but the movie felt kind of like a waste of time.",The Titan

I wish I followed the bad reviews advice and avoided this one. There is nothing you are missing here if you choose to watch something else.The plot is the big problem. The earth is becoming uninhabitable so the idea is to send people to Titan and in order to do this you have to change them into enhanced beings or aliens. Not sure why we wouldn't have sent normal people and built capsule like domes to live in that way you know all of humanity can go, instead it seems like 1 out of 10 would survive the transformation or just work out our problems here on earth.The acting was pretty good up until a moment in the movie were suddenly they rely on facial expressions to convey emotions instead of talking. Taylor whatsherface was great at this, Sam Worthington...not so much. Why they chose to do this was beyond me and a terrible choice... were they paying Sam Worthington by the word?

30,pkpera,What a pile of crap,1,2 April 2018,"It starts with some bizarre exodus or whatever - right in some expensive homes on high ground - while there is nuclear fallout on Earth. I must be stupid - expecting that in such situation some underground or inside mountain place would be more suitable.
Then, I must be stupid because as I know Venus has atmosphere ... I could list more heavy nonsense, but probably biggest is ""outgrown our home"" - they making parallel with family. The real parallel for this case would be: reckless, irresponsible child who kills his parents, and then must leave home because there is no more who to feed him. Minute later main hero says to man who has no children to f* off ... Oh yes, that means that if you have children, you can freely destroy your planet ... What about putting effort in saving this planet ? It will cost zillion times less than some moving to other planet, moon. And will save much-much more life. But that's something beyond brain of screenwriters, indeed.

31,srdjan_veljkovic,"Attempt at a sci-fi movie like in the old days, failed",4,13 January 2019,"It obviously takes inspiration from ""2001: A space Odyssey"" and similar old sci-fi movies. That's the pace, that's the atmosphere, those are the ""heavy subjects"" and lack of reliance on much special effects. If you don't like such movies, then this is a problem.But, I'm OK with such movies. The problem is that it doesn't work. Acting is bad, especially our protagonist, Sam Worthington, is bad. Taylor Shilling, his wife, is actually OK. She overacts a bit, but, in Sci-Fi, that's OK. Others do a rather bad job, though they mostly don't have much to work with.Another problem is the science behind this. I don't mean the genetics, sure, those are silly, but, hey, who knows, maybe someone someday does find a way to change the DNA and species of a live organism. The problem is that Titan is not the only celestial object with atmosphere and that it is _very_ cold, way too cold for any mammal to survive without some heating - and what Sam Worthington ends up being is some kind of mammal, albeit with some reptilian traits.The most fundamental problem is that none of this is actually interesting. The attempts at creating suspense or intrigue of any kind fall flat. In 2018., it's not at all interesting to see some ""super/meta/mutant"" human doing amazing feats. We see that in pretty much every ""big"" movie. Some of it as a consequence of genetic engineering (see Spiderman's Lizard).The end is also silly. Not only does our ""homo titanus"" walk naked on the Titan (which he could not have done), he ends up flying, on some little ""pterodactyle""-like wings. We don't even know if pterodactyle actually flew, or was like a chicken, just using those ""semi-wings"" to ""jump a little higher"". But, even worse, those semi-wings were much larger, relative to its size. So, there is no physical way that he could fly.Even leaving physics aside, CGI is very bad, the end is forced, without emotional effect or much sense, really.So, even if it is not terrible, just skip it and watch one of those old Sci-Fi movies.",The Titan

People are getting tired of many of the cliches seen on this movie, so when things start going wrong, eyes start rolling and you lose all good faith you had going for the movie.

It fails me to see what all the haters expected, well too bad for them. I thought the movie was OK, not top notch, but certainly OK.

NASA finally figures out a way to prepare humans for space exploration so that they could survive on the Moon Titan, the place where humans will colonize in order to solve Earth's starvation and overpopulation crisis. Titan was chosen because of its nitrogen rich river valleys, because nitrogen can be converted into breathable oxygen.I think the reason why the movie is considered boring is because there's a lot of sci-fi technobabble in it about genes and enzymes and lab experiments, with little plot. The writers focused on the sci-fi in place of drama but I found it interesting because beneath the surface this is a film about transhumanism and the attempt to guide the evolution of mankind so that humans may be able to walk on Titan, as in consciousness/intelligence expansion. The name Titan is another word for Gods and it was the only thing that gives mankind ""HOPE,"" to overcome the turmoil on Earth and survive as a species and that is to evolve mankind into the stars.",The Titan

37,carlos-pires,Interesting premise.... everything else is utter and complete nonsense,1,6 July 2020,"Let me give you a hint:
If you want to do ""Science Fiction"" PLEASE REFRAIN FROM FLUSHING ALL SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND LOGICAL REASONING DOWN THE TOILET.This movie starts off with an interesting premise. A breath of fresh air (or should I say, fresh nitrogen?). But it quickly spirals out of control into that dark, bottomless pit of god-fearing, anti-science, magical thinking hell.
If you watch this movie while Having the most basic knowledge about evolution it will render your brain numb from exposure to extreme ignorance. It is abundantly clear that whoever wrote the script is completely clueless about what evolution is (another hint: EVOLUTION IS NOT THE MUTATION OF A SINGLE ORGANISM THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING!!!). Furthermore, what good would it do Humanity to send an idiotic amphibian humanoid to a distant planet? What good would it do, if he would only just loiter around naked, doing nothing? Seriously... WTF?! Seems like the ultimate ingenious plan to save Humanity is... to send a moron to another planet in a one-way-trip... Great plan, guys!Anyway, the morals of the story end up being very close to what we have seen in the majority of writings about this subject matter for the last 200 years: God is good, science is bad, scientists are unscrupulous villains. And you should pray, believe, have faith, and breed. Furthermore, the life of a man with offspring is worth the life of a dozen men without.

38,scb_coldsteel,"Good idea, poor execution.",5,1 October 2018,"So I saw the new movie Titan on Netflix. Overall this was pretty mediocre Syfy channel material. There wasn't a shred of originality, or anything thought-provoking in the movie.The basic premise is pretty simple. The world is ending so a team of scientists want to explore the moon of Titan. Evacuating Earth for another planet is something we've seen done hundreds of times. What makes this different though, is that the movie also throws in soldiers being experimented on to advance evolution.It really feels like the writers of this movie set down and watched The Fly and Species and felt like mixing it with a repetitious sci-fi trope. Of course being unoriginal doesn't mean bad, and this movie wasn't really horrible. Of course it wasn't really good either. As a whole movie was incredibly unoriginal and predictable. But, I could see some people still being entertained by it.The acting was all average. No one roll released it out. The directing and cinematography or average. There wasn't a single scene It was memorable in the entire film.If you're looking for a mildly entertaining, but ultimately mediocre sci-fi film Titan is it.

As with soooo many other films that I've watched, despite low reviews, I wondered again what on earth people are expecting to see, that they would give it such bad ratings. I've decided that there is a real addiction to 'cowboys and indians' entertainment. As someone else noted here in the user reviews, that's Trump's America for ya.
On to the film. It's surprisingly delicate and lyrical. The acting is excellent and believable right across the board. There is no beating of chests, gnashing of teeth, tearing of hair. It's almost realistic. Of course that means that there is great acting, directing, development of plot, and so on. I *felt* as though it was really happening, I cared about the characters, I wanted to know more. In lieu of that, I will watch it again, perhaps more than once, if I have the opportunity. It really is masterful in every regard.
Okay, my only quibble, and maybe I wasn't paying attention at the start of it, is that for a world that's so chaotic and full of violence, to the point that scientists are looking to settle a different planet, the setting of the film is serene, lush and idyllic. I expect there's a reason for that, in the telling of the story. For this all to be happening in a setting of chaos would have been extremely distracting and would have made the delicacy and almost quietude of the telling impossible, so I'll take it lol

So many directions this film could have gone especially with fantastic directing esp special effects. Its worth watching but be aware the 3rd act is hard to imagine and shoots more for a sequel or remake.Spoilers:
The mad scientist lies to everyone that they are not only going to be better but he is adding a Bat gene so they can mutate and survive on Titan. Yes at the end of the film main character grows wings and flies. Okay one can swallow this but the hardest part is the military in the film. It suddenly goes from a cool sci fi project to one where the mad scientist has no control over the military or any plan on how to keep the mutating subjects locked up. The laughable part is 2 huge flaws: 1) He lets the mutants stay their last 2 days with their families rather than inside a protected sealed off section. 2) After main character survives the only solution is to control them by wiping their brain of any human memories.
Really? that is the best solution the writer could come up with. It is pathetic.What was the whole point of sending a new breed of Titan people to save our civilization if they dont remember anything or Planet Earth, plus as many on here have commented.. he is sent alone so it seems pointless to have one Titan to do what. Breed with himself or wait for future Titans. At least if they kept the one female Titan it would be plausible the story could hold together but instead it is wasted on typical Action/Military killing the female Titan.Overall a great effort by the director to keep it going but the 3rd act should have been re written before filming and maybe it would be a decent film.

54,JRmf,Not bad but...,7,1 July 2018,"Flicking through the users who wrote comments, it's clear this was not a crowd-pleaser. However as a professional scientist, I didn't find it so bad.Why Titan and not Mars? Mars has been done to death as the same people who pooh-poohed ""Titan"" would be quick to point out. Certainly the idea of populating Titan with humans force-evolved into Homo Titaniens is novel. I think one just has to accept that as a dramatic given. It certainly would not be technically easy, as the movie portrays.Titan is accurately described, with the inherent difficulties living there implied. Except for one point, how can nitrogen (or its compounds) be used to generate oxygen? That's transmutation, not possible outside of a nuclear reactor. Given the other scientific facts accurately described, this is a surprisingly wrong assertion.The movie is not without flaws. When Rick's female mate is killed (it's not clear why), I thought, ""Oh, oh"", how is he going to mate now? There's no mention of how Homo Titaniens procreates, so unless it's asexually, getting a single individual to Titan is not going to solve anything. It's been calculated that the minimum size of a viable human breeding colony is 100, with very careful genetic selection to avoid in-breeding.Some of the killings by soldiers of H.Titanies towards the end of the movie were given little explanation and don't make a lot of sense. When Collingwood calls for Abi, her son and friend to be killed because Rick would kill them all, I thought the soldiers might turn on him, but the crisis is left hanging and they all escape somehow.I had no problems with the steady, measured pace of the movie, quite appropriate.

But even though its been done to death, it wasn't necessarily bad, I found it to be very averagely done and honestly could have been and often has been done much worse. So while I wasn't enthralled by the story, it also wasn't a mess like many other films that use the same plot points, the story points were relatively well presented and I can only really describe it as average. Pretty much what you saw in the trailer is what this film is all about, not many alterations on the basic plot points.Everything else was admittedly average but not bad. I like the cinematography, which I found to be the best part of the film, the camera use and the color scheme were at least visually pleasing. The acting was also very average, though the film has many good actors, their performances were not their best, but also couldn't be considered their worst, as I said, very average. The writing wasn't anything to be amazed about, dialog wasn't very engaging but that might be because I've seen many movies that have the same plot points as I mentioned above.

62,ejonconrad,"Interesting premise, but it never delivers.",6,27 May 2018,"I watched this on my iPad on a plane, and that's exactly how I'd rate it: ""a decent plane movie"". It has an interesting premise: Tom Wilkinson plays a scientist who wants to genetically modify humans so they can live on Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. The movie focuses on one of the subjects and his wife. The approach is not particularly scientifically believable, but it has a certain 1970s charm, and Wilkinson is incapable of turning in a bad performance, even in a pretty bad part, so it initially drew me in (I had to pause it at the end of one flight and finish it on the next). It won't be a spoiler to say that the treatment turns out to have certain ""side effects"", and thus a plot is born. The main problem in the movie is that they never really decide whether Wilkinson's character is an obsessed visionary or merely a dangerous lunatic, so he's both by turns, culminating in an ending that will have you scratching your head and wondering what you were supposed to take away from this movie.",The Titan

It is also semi-cautionary about gene therapy and manipulating dna can have serious side effects.There were a few plot holes, even with the general premise. For example if one were able to make drastic changes to DNA and if that therapy were so advanced, why would they not design it so people could live in the so called 'uninhabitable' area's of Earth or on Mars, rather than Titan?It isn't all bad.

Similar flaws are frequent through out the movie.

The Human race is supposedly on the verge of extinction because the earth has been depleted of its natural resources and the planet is dying. Yet, this futuristic earth is by no means dystopian, on the contrary what we do witness is a healthy, robust earth with crystal clear skies and pristine oceans. There seems to be no shortage of anything. Everything is modern and expensive looking - great advances in science and technology have been made. It a planet of unusual wealth and wellbeing it seems. Everyone is beautiful and healthy. There is certainly no shortage of food, wine, whiskey and water. There's so much water people keep tubs of ice water in their refrigerators. So this idea that they must leave earth soon or the race will die is taken on faith. But wth all this technology at their disposal they can't seem to figure out how to make earth work, and they can't find another planet that will support life. That's a bummer. So this one scientist decides that the only solution is mutate human DNA so that humanity can carry on - living Titan a moon of Saturn.

86,jwcstorage,Probably not worth your time...,3,2 April 2018,"I love sci-fi ranging from schlock to masterpieces but this... this is just not good. The score is for the simple fact that this is an actual movie that loosely has a plot, actors, sets, and costumes. This honestly feels like a far-too-long off-brand Twilight Zone episode.The basic plot is this: The world is over populated and we dont have enough resources to continue to exist on Earth, so lets mutate soldiers to send them to Titan, the moon.It seems vaguely like it might make for an interesting watch, right? It doesnt. The movie spends its time mostly focusing on the very tame bodily changes happening to the participants of the trial. There are a lot of sitting on the bottom of the pool scenes where not much really happens. Then the participants that got this far go from a normal average human with unique abilities to a new species that cant talk, is aggressive, and no longer thinks like a human does. There is almost no chemistry between ANY of the characters. It felt more like a couch read than an actual movie. It didnt help once Sam Worthington and Missandei got all mutated up they lost the little humanity they had to begin with.Its shown in this movie that they're using Earth animal DNA to transform a human into being able to survive on a hostile other planet. Instead of creating a Cronenbergian horror that changing human DNA with multiple unrelated forms of animal DNA, it just kinda turns em blue'ish... with superpowers, because of course it did. Now that they have these new superpowers that they literally could not have known about or know how to use them, they are somehow perfectly suited to the harsh existence of Titan... and Earth? Because what good is a little body horror if your monster(s) arent going to spray around some red corn syrup? The plot is plodding, the conversations are dry and uninteresting, the practical effects were unimpressive, and the little CGI ... was there. It wasnt good or bad, it was just used so little that theres not much to say about it.The final shots of the movie were laugh out loud stupid. If you want a smart sci-fi flick, this isnt it. If you want one with a lot of cool action or technology, this isnt it. It you want a movie you can generally enjoy regardless of the themes or actors, this isnt it.If you want a movie to play while you try to sleep or while you are trying to study (to keep you from watching an actual movie) this might do the trick!

I like Sam Worthington, but this won't be high on his list of accomplishments when he retires. The plot is simply bonkers, but doesn't take the road to the Sanitarium until about three-quarters in. If you can gloss over the madness and lack of any plausibility, you might stay with it until the end. Okay... the story-line (put you anti-bonkers glasses on); The U.S Government decides that, as the world is dying, thanks to the pesky human race, they need to move to Titan, one of Saturn's moons (naturally), but the environment on the planet is too hostile for humans - there being no water or oxygen. The natural progression to, what should be a terminal end to that discussion, is to take a group of soldiers and create super-humans, by injecting them with the DNA of other species. This would enable man to migrate en mass. At this point, I felt a little embarrassed, I didn't see this blindingly obvious solution! There's only one (there are really a lot more) reason that this is barking mad: Only 1 in 5 appear to actually survive this process. The whole concept and story-line seems to have been conceived after reading Wikipedia, whilst taking illegal substances! If they'd left the 'stupidity' dial on mark one, they might have gotten away with the madness - but, no... they turned it up to max power! Somehow the remaining subjects become something that no amount of DNA tinkering could produce and it's at that point that the suspension of belief is no longer possible. Hidden away somewhere among the absurdity, is a love story, or, at least a, 'love conquers all', overly sentimental message. The acting is very good, so everyone take a bow for that, but when a story-line is so barmy that it gives you a 'frown' headache, it can't be good. The irony is that this is another attempt by a U.S. movie to tell us that we are killing our planet, whilst America is a major contributor to it. Surely, rather than create super-humans to live in a hostile new world, cutting carbon emissions might be easier??

There's some nice, slick futuristic settings as well. At worst, there's little 'action' or 'space action' and the like, as it all takes place on earth (mostly). This is high praise from me, as I love a good 'space' & 'space travel' Sci-Fi flick!It definitely doesn't deserve a '1' (or a '3' or '4' for that matter) in my opinion.

So many things in this movie just made absolutely no sense. And not in the funny kind of way that makes you laugh. This tried so hard to be taken seriously. I have so many questions about the ending. Why can he no longer communicate at all (gestures, writing stuff down)? Why would his two middles fingers fuse together, how does that help? How is he a ""miracle""? Isn't the whole purpose of these experiments ruined once the female subject dies since now they can't reproduce? Along those lines, why is the fully evolved subject now junkless; how would he have saved the human race if he has no junk? And finally, when the hell did he get wings and why can he now fly?",The Titan

108,treborbasset,Very mediocre,3,17 December 2020,"I thought the premise sounded really interesting - Earth uninhabitable, so they travel to Titan and evolve humans so they can live there.Actually, that isn't really what the film was about. Almost the entire movie was just the people going through tests in a base on Earth, and their personal relationships. You would have no idea that it was set in the future or that Earth was ruined.It feels like this was an attempt to make sci-fi for women - the film was mainly about how the woman in the film is losing her man because of the changes in him. There were very few sci-fi elements.The plot made very little sense. Why would they try to change humans into something capable of living on Titan, instead of just building a base on it that has oxygen, plants, water etc. And what is the point of sending 1 modified human to live on Titan by himself? How does that save humanity?The entire premise is absurd, but for sci-fi I could forgive that, if it was actually interesting, thought-provoking, or entertaining. This film was none of those things.",The Titan

Instead of shaping a planet to fit man, we shape a man to fit the planet. The concept is good but I feel that they spent to much time with what I call ""chit chat scenes"" and not enough time with the science.

The budget was there and there were no major technical problems . The number of serious scientific gaffs was tolerably low, if barely. I agree with the other reviewers who said ""it could have been really good""; however, at about the halfway point, the film falls apart almost entirely. The science dies horribly, the plot thins and quickly tanks, the decisions of the main players become absurdly contrived, and even so too the special effects.

The families of the elite were accepted to help save the human race by turning into the alien from Prometheus to bring back resources or one day live in Saturn. As all thing government, they lied about what exactly they were doing and created a monster or monsters. The movie is creative in showing how they make the super human but there isn't much action. If you enjoyed the more science side of annihilation then you will enjoy this. I rated a 7 because somethings didn't make sense. Why would they allow the super humans to stay with their families if some showed aggression? How did he suddenly turn from human to alien like? So many whys to count.

113,mojotre,Scifi that is worth watching.,6,8 April 2018,"Yes there are spoilers so this is your second warning, I checked the box.I didn't read a single review before watching this. I watched it without my wife's knowledge and she won't be happy about that. She would not have liked it though I suspect she might connect with the family aspect so maybe I will watch it again with her (I think I could do a second viewing).The premise began well: Why terraform a planet when we can adapt the people we send to the conditions of the destination. Maybe that has been done before but I haven't seen it. I was hooked.Earth is dying out and we need a new home. Moon Titan seems a bit of a stretch given how difficult the environment is (and distant), but this is Scifi. Ready to move forward.Half the Earth population is going to die out in 10 years (circa 2060) because there are no remaining resources. Begs the question as to whether the species would die out from anything short of nuclear annihilation. We have gotten pretty good at manipulating this rock. Reduce the population to 1/10th what it is today (750 million) and that is more than enough for genetic diversity even should you half again it a couple few times. Time to enact disbelief suspension mode, done.If we can alter our genetics to live on Titan, well there are closer and more reasonable alternatives, say Mars, or Venus. Even the Moon? The most obvious being alter the genetics to continue on an Earth as it will be. But fine, activated disbelief suspension moments ago so still good to go.I have read another review here and I have some level of agreement, the adaptations made for Titan would really have worked well to make a Homo Aquaman. Could have easily gone in that direction and even reduced cost. As per previous, resources are gone so into infinity and beyond!Why kill Eve? I guess our hero will be spawning tadpoles. More detail here would have been welcome, but they didn't. OK, my mind can fill in that blank.Why kill off Eve? I thought they were going somewhere with that. Interpersonal relationship between the doctor wife, her hero husband and his future mate. That could have been a gripping sub-plot but it was either avoided, unseen or the writers were not up to it. Which brings me to my primary issue with this story.The production was good. The acting was good. The premise was great. The writing was sub par, but not without merit. It seems all the sub-plots were decided based on how quickly they could be checked off. I too had a real problem with, ""He nearly died but the operation was a success so he can go home now for the next couple days, until blast off"". No, the Government, being the control freaks they normally are, and in this case warranted, would keep Adam and Eve in a controlled environment and might allow their families to visit.The Eve character was not well developed and again, I hold the writers to blame. It seems SHE is Muslim as is her husband, though this is vague. Somehow this was the explanation of why she was going but it was unclear. Her husband felt it would get her ""right in the head"" or something they were contending with. I will need to watch that part again I think. The problem here is the same problem with all the families. They are all portrayed as intelligent people doing this to extend the survival of the species and yet knowing this, they all think they will be be joining one another on Titan at some point in the future? Because the transition wasn't killing 90% of the transformies and resources to build more rockets are available when we can't support the population on Earth. Once the transformation begins, it should be abundantly clear there is no coming back.All in all I enjoyed this movie despite the writing. It could have been so much more, even had it never left the Earth. There was a point where I thought to myself this could have been cool had Adam and Eve used their super-human abilities to escape and populate Earth, feeding on Humans. That would have required more than 97 minutes and it seems they were tightly held to that.As another reviewer mentioned, there were seemingly several endings all layered there at the finale. None of which gave any real measure of closure and I suspect the last one was meant to do that with a real cool factor, but it didn't. I was hoping for tadpoles. Still, this movie made me think, gave a interesting twist to how to populate other worlds, and held my attention throughout. A 4 from me means maybe you will like it, I didn't. A 5 means I don't think you would regret it. A 6, what I did give it, means I think it will be enjoyable for those that like the genre, as I did.",The Titan

116,dragonroars-57812,"It is a drama, wrapped in poor science fiction.",5,4 May 2019,"The drama is fair to average but the story makes very little sense. The writer forgets to explore ""science facts"" prior to writing the fiction. The premise is the Earth being over populated and having to explore space. The moon Titan has a much smaller surface of the Earth. In fact, only 16% the surface of Earth. So how does moving to Titan make room? The next factor, Earth is starving and resources will be depleted. Since Titan is a dead moon, what do the billions of people you put there eat? Along with the genetically altered people, you better be sending up plants and animals. I looked up information on Titan and it took me 5 to 10 minutes to realize the moon is too small. While it has a nitrogen atmosphere, there would be nothing to eat and new people would starve. Mars would be closer, has atmosphere, and much larger with double the surface of Titan.This is just another writer telling us that the Earth is a disposable planet. Our survival in the next 100 years depends on us to settle other worlds and let Earth rot. This movie fails to inspire anyone to reach for the stars. This movie is dark, bleak, and shows no hope for any future. I found the medical ethics questionable and deplorable.The better story would be about a human astronaut having to leave his wife and child to colonize a new base on Titan. Showing how they deal with the struggle of not seeing each other for a few decades. This movie glossed over the time it takes to reach Titan. His son would have been a teen or young adult by the time he set foot on the moon. I am no expert, but I know it takes over 3 years to reach Saturn.

117,santasa99,Beyond stupid,1,14 November 2020,"Science fiction films are prone to plot glitches that make a film more or less stupid - this is understandable as it comes with a territory - but sometimes one can keep watching them regardless of such glitches and stupid plot developments for a host of different reasons - good or even revolutionary effects and visuals, maybe good acting, or some other story lines that came up better if one is able to disregard main plot blunders, which is easier if these are related to some details concerning a scientific unknowns or technical/technological background and not main premise or plot devices that are badly conceived, and so on. However, this film is beyond all that. This moronic idea is like a brainchild of a failed drunken writer, or as if it has been found in most idiotic story from the cheapest pulp magazine or off a street kiosk paperback book. Forget its political and ideological messages, if there is any meaningful, to hell with any ethical implications and the fact that British scientist, played by Tom Wilkinson, who is at one point compared to Hitler, and who ends up being actually triumphant despite of all his unnerving heinousness - and I guess viewers should reconsider him as being right all along. All that is irrelevant in the ""bigger picture"" of the film's topic and in the face of a one question: why on Earth they have to go to live on Titan, if the Anglo-American science is capable of turning a human into a creature able to live in any hostile environment, even on a desolate moon-planet deep within outer Solar system?!",The Titan

And then it falls apart in the final act. As presented, there are several possible endings that are just sidetracks on the way to the actual ending.From the book, the point of Lt. Janssen's transformation is so that he can prepare Titan for human habitation. That ending's confused by the ""Adam and Eve"" subplot they appear to set up, but really don't. So, he's not the first, and only, member of a new race of humans--which makes no sense. He's an advance scout. There to prepare the way for everyone else.

120,zaywhat,"Great idea, some story flaws",5,31 March 2018,"A great sci-fi idea messed up with the evil scientist concept. He told them some would die. OK, he should have said most of you. He told Abi that near death in the desert would be a walk in the park compared to this program. The outrage that participants were dying or ""changing into an animal"", as Abi put it, was ridiculous. Titan is minus 290 degrees, methane and ammonia. Surely Abi's medical knowledge or to be more realistic, any grade 6 graduate, would imagine that the skin, eyes, orifices in general would have to be wildly different than a human. The idea that the whole family would reunite on Titan was Rick's lie to his son or stupidity. It was pretty clear that not many humans could survive the transition. The new creatures would have to procreate. They would not have brought families to the facility, only the soldiers, but OK, it was a nice place. Certainly after Rick and Tally turned into Titan fishies, it would be clear that they were not going to be human anymore. Did Abi think she was going to take Titan fishie home to coach scorched earth little league? Surely Rick's discomfort in the earth environment would have quickly escalated to the point he could no longer survive the blistering heat of a 70 degree afternoon and it would be clear to everyone he had to go.They would not have sent the Titan fishies home to their families 2 days before launch. They would remain in the controlled environment and be given the memory melt as a routine shot. Makes no sense. This wasn't a training mission, it was humanity's last hope. They would not have killed girl Titan fishie. They would clean up the mess she made of her husband and continue the mission. Species don't tend to survive without a breading pair. And in the last standoff, there was no visible change of heart. Just all of a sudden, everybody goes ahead with the mission that they were willing to die to prevent a minute earlier.

The film is set in the future, and human kind have damaged the earth to the point that we have to leave the planet.Military candidates offer themselves as subjects for 'improvements', so they can survive on Titan one of Saturn's moon's .The scientists are aware that the human DNA has to be 'adjusted' to suit Titans atmosphere and to be able to survive and use the 'water'.Sam Worthing plays the role well, along with the rest of the cast. Not all but most.The film shows us about human sacrifice to save others and also how playing god will always have terrible consequences. The film also focuses on the unknown and wanting to control the uncontrollable. Killing the subjects because they can't be tamed, or controlled shows that humans having an need of hierarchy and supremacy over the 'newer humans'. Which of course negates their experiments, as change is expected but the changes that take place were not truly anticipated. The idea of the story is great, yes there could have been a little more air time on the experiments and the effects, including timeline for the outcome, as there were a lot of people willing to undertake the procedures.People wanted more of life on Titan, but I think the film was delivered well.Highly recommended, if you want to see a film that delivers a basic but potentially real scenario, because let's face it we are destroying the planet.This film delivers",The Titan

Hasn't the most important evolutionary advantage of mankind been intelligence? So why are all the participants chosen for their survival skills incredibly stupid? Ah - it might be, because the scientists in the movie would also fail any entrance exam to a university.

The premise, although not very original, is quite interesting: humanity has used up all of earth's recourses and now faces extinction forcing scientists into desperate and risky solutions. One of which is effing (excuse my french) with evolution to make super humans that can survive the uninhabitable environment of saturn's largest moon Titan. So the movie starts of pretty solid, the situation on earth and the experiment are explained, which should give the viewer a good foundation to start of with, but then, slowly, and I mean like VERY slowly, it gets worse and worse. The balance between build up and action is so out of proportion that even someone who has literally never seen a movie in their life could point it out. We get 89 minutes of watching the main character transform into this super human and then 3 minutes of stuff actually happening.But this isn't even the most annoying part. Probably the worst thing about Titan is the uncountable plot holes. The movie starts of by insinuating that the main character and his wife are willing to do anything for their kid, yet when another test subject goes crazy and kills his wife in front of this woman she still lets her own mutated husband sleep in their home? And how is it possible that one test subject can try to off his entire family yet another loves his so much he can not bare to leave them? And how can you continue an experiment in which everyone has such extremely different reactions? And what's the point of putting one super human on this moon? And what the hell is he going to eat?

To build factories to start shipping stuff to earth?
To build habitats so that people from earth can get to there?

That being said, I typically don't walk away from a movie on that alone. The premise is preposterous and feels like the entire concept was someone's random joke movie concept that someone else took way too far.Beyond that, we are met with a film that steadily pushes the boundaries of credibility. I lost count of the number of times the story seems to have forgotten dialog that came before, or characters behaving completely contrary to their established behavior earlier. The story seems to want to be making some kind of grand statement, but ignores and invalidates everything it says at some point later.The story has no idea when to stop, and has no idea what any character's motivations are. It seems to want to pull a fast one on the viewer so there are many false leads (or maybe those are just an artifact of how poor this whole thing is). And in the end the twist is... well what the bad guy said he was going to do at the beginning of the film... or maybe it's that after apparently refusing to the point of requiring a ""chemical lobotomy"" to go to titan, the film ends with him standing on titan. I guess the movie needed a bad guy, and someone forgot that they had to ""beat the bad guy"" so they shoehorned in somie comeuppance for him or something.Multiple times the movie seems to shift tone from being a serious potentially interesting character study of what someone might experience going through something like this, to a scary thriller, to an action flick, and finally ending on something that feels like a wanna be iron giant/disney movie type of thing.At the end of the day, this was mostly just another letdown of a film. It never delivers on anything it sets up. It lacks the depth or creativity to be meaningful, but falls way too short of being just another ""popcorn movie"".

They do all the above in this movie, rather well. OF course, you have tons of ways you can criticize this movie. Of course, things could have been better. There are some instances where its just hard to swallow. But movies are made for entertainment, not for us to slice them into tiny pieces.

Mission becomes clear, and the Candidates faces only some light Changes / adaptions for the Mission, Titan envoriment.It goes then bit much into non interresting Family life to get Audience more into family feeling.
And here already the whole thing junk itself!
Did the Story writer really thought, that whole deep Loving Familys stay asside, while each one member ( candidate ) become clearly openly complete pure reduced to "" Labratory Rats "" with "" changes "" what is even not done in normal Scyfy Movies ( and the movie meant to be playing in the now time ) at Death Sentenced Candidates, and mostly not even at them, because of Human rights ( even in movies!!!! ) ?
It seems like the writer had not spended even a second in such a thought. Even more it goes, that the Familys dont even start a bit Questioning , what is going on, when their "" beloved ones "" went through Extreme changes.

One bad movie after another one, and the trend seems to continue. Sustaining life at -180 degrees is just stupid in an environment where the gravity is even less than that on the Moon, on a planet that receives only 1% as compared to Earth, light from the sun... in other words scientifically stupid. I can put up with people walking in the absence of gravity otherwise the plot could nor unfold, but this is ridiculous. However, one thing caught my attention and that is the movie seems to be a publicity stunt for NATO, probably financed by NATO. For such terrible warmonger, criminal entity such as NATO, it calls for some advertising, for the simple minds. So here it is, a deeply humane, truly scientific, very well played movie.

Not great, but not terrible either.
The FX are decent, the premise is silly as you would expect, and the plot goes largely unexplored, ie they don't really get to Titan, well one of them does, for all of 5 mins.The idea is that Tom Wilkinson and his team of secret biologists need to develop some kind of super human to be sent to a remote planet, Titan, this being needs to be able to live there without the need for life support (we are never told why). So no oxygen tank, no pressurized suit etc etc, therefore in some way advancing human evolution to live in extreme conditions. Hoorah!Stupidly, in the end, they only get to send one guy up, and by the time they do, he has morphed so much into a fish person he woud be unable to reproduce anyway, so the idea of re-starting the human race on a another planet is already doomed to failiure, and considering it cost 13bn ( I think that's what they say in the film) it's a very very expensive waste of time.PLUS, to add to the unbelievability factor, the participants ( sam Worthington and gang) of the evolutionary scheme who slowly transform into fish like creatures, spend most of their time in a swimming pool, complaining about heat and light, while they shed their skin and morph into some kind of human/animal/fish crossbreed.So when Sam Worthington (in his fish suit) FINALLY ends up on Titan, where is seems to be boiling hot and dry as a bone, it does seem rather weird. They turn him into a fish, teach him to sit under water for hours at a time, just to send him to this boiling dessert planet......fail.The things that do work are the family scenes, there is some love in there that feels real, there is a feeling of the man who fell to earth in here, I like Sam Worthington and the rest of the cast were all decent enough.2001 it aint.

The plot is interesting, the experiments look good and rigid
The action and reaction of the characters, the decisions they made
all looks quite reasonable, and understandable.BUT, after the final surgery, every has gone abysmal
otherwise I would have given it an 8---spoiler ahead---Throwing all reasoning away, all logical thinking and motive.
After the final surgery, 2 subjects survived.
The changes were drastic and out of nowhere.
Before, every changes was understandable, but this? The membrane that make ear stick to the head? middle and ring fingers knitted together? suddenly communicate in higher frequency? The little tentacle from their finger tips?And what for? Cat eye is for seeing in the dark, amphibian DNA for survival under water and cold-tolerance. But what is the point of the tentacle from the finger? What is the point of changing voice frequency so they cannot communicate? These traits only make things unnecessarily complicated as they now cannot talk and dangerous.BUT THAT WAS NOT THE WORST
Worst thing was, the head scientist, after billions of investment, suddenly decided these 2 subject can go home. Despite being the ONLY 2 SURVIVING SUBJECTS from the entire program. Despite knowing that they could become violent and escape. Despite knowing that the soldiers did not welcome them and paranoia about them. As a result, they lost 1 more subject.Then, our protagonist, Rick ran away after killing a bunch of soldiers. His wife found him and did nothing but stare at each others. Afterward they were captured, the head scientist said she was beat unconscious because she ""ran away"". BUT they did continue to stare at each others despite the light and the sound of helicopter coming, I thought they somehow surrender??Then, they had Rick captured in the cage, guns pointed at him. The head scientist want his wife to give him an injection to wipe his memory. THE MEMORY-WIPING SOLUTIONS WERE RIGHT NEXT TO THE SALINE SOLUTION. This was so obvious I felt offended. So the writer somehow think the audiences will be surprise?In the first place, why would you want to wipe his memory? Even though Rick refused to go, they should have try to persuade him. Memory-wiping should not be an option at all. I mean, after they sent him to Titan, of cause they would want to follow-up right?? Otherwise how do they know if he can really survive there. He is all alone in that big moon, what is his mental stability and all? Or they could even ask him for some info on the Titan like if there would be any chance to build or grow something there.In the end, Rick still went to Titan.
I mean, the last 30 minutes of conflicts here was because HE REFUSE TO GO. He refused so much that the head scientist want to wipe his memory.

So we going to send modified humans to live over there in darkness at -179 degrees Celsius warmth breathing Nitrogen, eating exactly what and having bath in liquid methane? The rest of us 10 billion (mid 21st century) will die 10 years later. No option of fixing our planet!Chapter TWO - in case you are late on beginning of the movie so you dropped in the chapter two, you will see a scientific experiment going on to make super athletes of Olympics (as they swim extremely good, meditate at bottom of pool, run very fast) with unclear involvement of NATO forces and what NASA is doing there? Or... Subjects are selected from NATO ranks so it must be scientists making platoon of Universal Soldiers! No? Why a lot of armed forces are running around in campus? Shoot any subject-go-wrong! Since when best athletes are in NATO ranks? Wait, this must be a strange disease (Legend, alien virus?) and they are looking for a cure... No again :-( Hold on, this is NASA making a future astronaut to send on alien world. That is it - reason for Chapter one to exist :-)
Based on this chapter, the movie can be developed into anything drama based. Families brought together to enjoy, later to see loved ones suffer.
At one moment I thought this is going to end up as horror movie with all killed (and no chapter three).Chapter THREE - you can see 3D Mark benchmark program class of animation where our super human stands on desolate alien world, jumps to swim in cold ocean and - my God! - it flies like Batman! What a happy ending for a single ""human"" enjoying there all alone!Alternate ending would be - rocket failure at launch so no chapter three at all and we have better drama movie!Now I am going to watch James Cameron's Avatar as a good adventure movie (when we are leaving for Pandora?) in order to wash the bad!",The Titan

She deserves so much better than this rather weak effort at the Sci-Fi genre.
It's not that the acting was bad, in fact I thought that all the performances were good. It's just the unbelievable premise of the script. First as the film started why did NATO ship in family men and women as volunteers complete with their families? Surely if your going to go through some horrible experimental transformation into a non-human monster you would be a crazy human monster to insist that you drag your family along to watch.
Also as many others have pointed out human beings are an exceptionally adaptable creature which is why we survive over all the other humanoids that have come before. Even if there are only a few thousand survivors from some vague catastrophe depicted in the film, we, as a species have been here before when massive climate change nearly wiped out the human race 90,000 years ago.

I tend to pick up my phone and smack down a rating if I'm getting bored of a film, so a little over the halfway (when things started to pitch downhill) I gave it a 4. Which, at the time felt firm but fair.I spent remaining half of th film fighting to keep my hands off the rating. Even as I'm writing this I'm in the last 10 minutes and bam there goes another star. Bam another one. I started writing this review at 3...I'm afraid...I just don't know if I have have the strength to leave it at a 2.It's not so much the plot holes, and the cliches...it's that the decisions devolve and become so ridiculously...stupid. That's the only word I have to describe it is, stupid. So at times I did have to laugh out loud. Saying ""what..why? Why would you do that?""In any case. Welp yeah there goes the last star. A 1. It probably doesn't deserve it, but it's just not quite bad enough to be a little good. Probably a good ""watch with friends and openly mock"" movie, but even those I'd want something with a little more heart and soul. There's much worse movies out there so I wouldn't say it's a ""hard 1."" At least It didn't make me angry and actively resent it for watching it. I guess, since it got bad enough for me to turn off before it ended, with the hope for a payoff abandoned long ago...for that it deserved a second star back. Better leave it at that.",The Titan

First off, Worthington is yet playing another role similar to his character in ""Avatar"", being as charismatic and nuanced as a sack of potatoes. No joke, watching him act is like watch paint dry. The audio is bad, I needed to use subtitles to hear what the characters were saying. This movie takes place on an Earth engulfed in economic and environmental disaster yet all we see of any of that is lazily shown through a news clip on a tablet (Environmental dystopias just need to go away). Yet the characters inhabit a suburban like base surround by idyllic landscapes and act like upper middle class yuppies.

The clincher is the end scenes in both stories are virtually identical. The re-engineered human, the ""Man Plus"", is standing on Titan/Mars as if coming home for the first time.

This time, the monster is a creation for the colonization of the moon of Saturn, Titan.To cut to the chase, the movie misses important beats. In its haste to cover the direction of a journey to Titan and moral and physical complications, the movie essentially misses its goal - that of presenting the audience with the moral complications of a sentient species designing its successor - and only succeeds with faint allusions.This is far from Gattaca, it's just a simple monster movie, and sadly so. Worthington and Schilling all turn in really great parts to the script, the problem is that the script and/or the direction of it just doesn't cut the mustard.The journey to Titan quickly becomes a placeholder for a reason for the main character's transformation, and of that transformation, we see little redeeming qualities. There is little to take home or appreciate here, other than a message of ""appreciate what you have"". Nonetheless, the movie is competent and well-acted, despite any narrative flaws.

There was an unnecessary chase scene, and a few scenes where it didn't make sense to involve some characters the way they did.

247,jo_men_visst,What kind of briefing did they get?,3,29 September 2018,"The most frustrating films I've seen were frustrating not so much because they were bad. No. They are frustrating because of squandered potential. You have this story of a man who undergoes a dangerous body-altering hail mary attempt at finding a way to make a human that can survive on one of Saturns moons... Ok. Let's ignore the glaring omission to tell us why this tech can't help us survive ON EARTH... among other things. Let's ignore that. What you have is a very interesting premise that let's you explore what a group of families would go through during a potentially traumatizing and even deadly bodyhorror transformation. The homes are set up to monitor daily lives in case things go wrong (they are essentially lab-rats after all). Everything is planned out and thought through.Except... While they supposedly gave out health and safety manuals the size of russian novels, no psych evaluation seems to have taken place. Noone bothered to tell the subjects of not only the risks but even what they could expect if everything went as planned. They have a world class scientist among the spouses but refuse to brief her about what would happen if things were a success. Oh, and the head doctor supposedly idolizes nazi war criminals as they imply.Why these counterproductive elements shoved into the script? Because we need drama and conflict . Nevermind that it cheapens the narrative, makes characters look moronic and is just plain distracting. We need drama. And we can only get that from shoving stupidity down audiences throats If this story had a director like Cronenberg it could have been a harrowing emotional journey even if they never got to titan. Now? It ended up being a frustrating 90 minutes as all I saw were the interesting directions they could have gone in.Oh... And an evolved human is still a human. We have quite a few orbital bodies around the sun which have atmospheres. If you want to swim you are probably better off going to europa. According to many futurists we probably would be better off hollowing out asteroids than terraforming planets and moons. And movies like these need science advisors if they want to be taken seriously.In short.

So we have the paraplegic marine Jake here in what could be said a backstory of sorts (yeah, no kidding). 'Nuff trolling, let me give you my honest thoughts to you on this...The Titan is a sci-fi apocalyptic thriller of sorts where in the future, the overpopulation has nearly wiped off the humans from the face of Earth and we have a group of soldiers who partake on a mission to undergo body alterations and travel to Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System orbiting Saturn... except we never get to see that latter part. The plot is an absolute mess with the story going nowhere and the cast is just plain bland, lifeless and tiring... newcomer Lennart Ruff is all over the place directing this one and the writing and dialogues are just plain boring and non-innovative. There's little to none for the viewer to get engrossed in as several scenes seem out of order, the script just throws out a few facts about the life conditions on Titan although the movie doesn't even ponder over the world-building which, as I said earlier, makes the entire concept of the movie useless. The inter-politics with NASA and NATO make no sense whatsoever. The antagonist is an old dude who seems totally devoid of the Titan Operation and seemingly has no direction or vision which literally just makes the characters that sign up for the mission as scapegoats. It gets funnier when Jake-- Rick, I mean... (That's his name in the film but who even cares, right?) when Rick's wife somehow has access to the laboratory (They don't even show how she got into it, which is a major plot-hole in itself!) and still proceeds with the mission without little retaliation because who really cares about Jake-- I mean Rick here, right? Yeah, you get my point. And that, my point is proven when Jake becomes the paraplegic marine we all love and his face literally screams to the end the misery he and the viewers are in. You know what's even worse? The ending is a complete redux of whatever that took place and they continue with the mission, or shall I say, create a V2 of the mission after they've gotten rid of the vile old antagonist. Gee, talk about pointless.

Easy? Yes the CRISPR technology has made it easy, cheap, quick and effective to move genes from one DNA to change another DNA and move genes between species if we know what we are doing. Through the techniques of molecular biology humans are going to be able to design living organisms, human beings can be manipulated and most organisms that we eat have been modified either through molecular biology or breeding. All food today is in a way design of humans to sustain live and be able to reproduce and live so many. The population growth is possible ONLY because we have changed nature, plants and animals that we eat. We can easily imagine that human DNA that IS humans (we are DNA) is capable of changing itself and designing itself and it will be normal in the future to do so just as it is normal today to splice human DNA to bacteria to make human protein to heal genetic faults such as lack of insulin or other proteins that humans need that have bad DNA and would dye otherwise. Almost everything is possible but not necessarily good or desirable the future will be very different. 
That being said DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT IS REALISTIC OR POINTS TO A SMART WAY TO SAVE MANKIND.
If you are able to ignore and come to terms with the fact that the plot to save mankind by going to Titan moon of Saturn instead of going to Mars which is a much better. Then you can enjoy the rest just as it is. Realistically Mars is much more likely to be the best place in our solar system to start a colony of humans if earth is not sustaining mankind any more. And we would probably not change mankind (or at least not drastically) but rather use technology to make humans possible to live on Mars. And it is not good idea to try to change mankind so much that it can survive on Titan without any technology.
But if you can ignore those things above then you can possible enjoy the movie AS I DID.
This is a film that I liked to watch. This film has everything that makes it good for killing time and having fun, action, drama, science fiction, adventure, fantasy, thriller and most importantly it's mostly well done. A clever film that assumes its audience is intelligent but not stuck on reality issues. If you can enjoy film that is not realistic but fun to watch and uses possible future technology to do crazy things but goes so far that it becomes mixture of Sci-Fi, fantasy and adventure in the sense that it is not realistic in any way shape or form then you will probably enjoy the film. 
A fresh breeze of originality within the limits of this kind of film. It has character build up, has action, drama, science fiction, thriller and love. It is beautiful to watch. The acting was good. The plot is more original than many similar movies I have seen the last 10 years (with few exceptions). Some critics have said in their critic reviews that some bits are a little too unbelievable and yes it is Sci-Fi, fantasy, adventure, drama, action, thriller :-).
It's not one of the best films within the last decade. It's a film that set the bar high enough for the science fiction loving type as I am to enjoy and have a nice time, killing time and not getting bored on the way and not regretting spending the time watching. In the film the classic problem of the future of mankind is being solved with genetically modifying humans in extreme ways. Is it realistic in the sense that it could possibly be genetically possible to change mankind as much as is done in the movie? Well I would say NO and if you are looking for science fiction within realistically possible then don't bother watching but if you look at it more as mix of science fiction and adventure in the sense some people enjoy Star Wars without asking is that realistic or not.

The only thing you see of Saturn's moon is the guy standing there for the last five seconds of the movie.The whole movie is about the high tech genetic modifications on these soldiers to make them adaptable to Titan's climate. Nine out of ten of the soldiers die. One starts hemmoraging. One goes beserk and has to be shot down. Another kills her partner and has to be shot down. All of this because of the genetic modifications they're getting.You see, Earth is over populated so man must move to Titan, which has an atmosphere of 95% nitrogen, almost 0% oxygen, and a temperature of about 300 below zero. Being so similar to Earth it costs only 300 million dollars to genetically prepare a soldier to live there, so it's a very feasible alternative to Earth and certainly much easier than consuming fewer resources on Earth and thus solving the over population problem at home.When the hero soldier is finally all modified up, he can't speak anymore. ""They communicate at low frequencies"" the doctor tells us. So he can no longer speak with his wife. he can only stare at her with an expressionless alien face. He can't pick up a pencil and write. He can't do much of anything except swim underwater really well. Who knows what he's going to do all by himself on Titan?

You have zero empathy for anyone in the film. The actors are wooden, unlikable, and hard to watch.

If you decide to not find me, find a reputable acting coach and go back to training for a few months....or as long as it takes for you to understand.You're too old and too successful to not be making better choices for you dialogue delivery.When you say a line playing the husband like ""I love you"", to your wife, while your characters are in a romantic setting in a pool, looking into each others eyes, you should put enough heart into that line that those watching feel a little swept away in the fantasy that is your characters love for each other. When you deliver a line like this properly it makes the viewer care about your two characters as a couple, they become invested in what happens for you as they become emotionally involved.When you have a line as a father like ""We come in peace earthling..."" to your young son, the more fun and playful you are with your son, the more people will love your character. Both women and men can appreciate a dad who gets a little silly with his son, makes the silly alien voice and cracks his son up into laughter. That's the kind of dad people wish they had, the kind of character that will make people become emotionally attached to you. This helps later on in the movie when dramatic things happen to your character. It's what the writer put into the script to have people see your characters heart and fall in love with it. When you chose to keep lines like that pretty dead, not playful and not warm or natural and just say them with a pretty limited amount of any emotion, it just turns it all into a boring slog. We check our phones for what's happening on our facebook accounts...because you haven't hooked us into what's happening with you.Every time you as an actor see a new sentence, you get to make all new choices for that sentence. If you keep choosing to say sentence after sentence with similar tone, timing and range as an actor you become soo boring to watch. Take a look at your favorite actors Sam. When you watch a masterful actor they change they're tone, speed and choices every sentence. They keep their choices exciting and as choices that serve the script and film. Choices like that as an actor are what can make a movie something you get lost in, or something that's just on in the background of your life until it's over and you've forgotten what it was about five minutes later.When an actor like you gets paid as much as you do, you owe it to yourself, the industry and the craft of acting to do a better job than this. Please find a good acting coach, show them this work and ask them about how next time you can do the script better justice by making choices as an actor that have a range in them. Make your choices based on what's best for how you look as an actor and also choices that will be the best ones for the feature film...making it gripping and connecting....you'll find that both are the same.I know you don't know me, but if you read this find that high rated acting coach and ask them. You have people offering you huge roles in huge projects.You owe it to yourself, you managed to get in a position in the industry where you get regular leading man work, now if you just put a little work into understanding your craft a little better, you could make movies like this one something sooo boring and forgettable into something gripping and interesting all the way through.

The actors did the best they could with such a weak storyline. The ending was down right confusing. Meh...,The Titan
330,lucien86,Incredibly Bad Science. Beyond (Below) Awful,1,14 December 2018,"Yes this thing has such bad science that it deserves a place in the top ten worst science fiction films of all time.. Can you learn to swim in boiling iron by training? No. The premise of this story is just as ridiculous, a human living on Titan - adapted to live on Titan without a spacesuit. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and Titan is what? 150 degrees below. Makes someone learning to fly by flapping their arms seem sensible.
A lot of science fiction films get science incredibly wrong, this goes a lot further than that. This defecates on basic science and minimal common sense in a way that defies belief. All involved should be ashamed.",The Titan

Yeah, the story is simple, nothing new, everything is predictable. However, it's still a nice story to watch. In desperate situation requires desperate measure. To save humanity, people are willing to take extreme measure. Searching for a habitable planet similar to our blue-watered planet is the typical solution but this film goes to an extra mile. Why don't we change the human DNA or genome instead so that human can adapt/evolve to survive the harsh condition of the foreign planet.Just because a big action star Sam Worthington is in it with a sci-fi premise, don't expect an all-out action film aka monster vs human.

The main actor gives a good performance, but in the last act they basically cut him out and left all the weaker cast members to fill in the void. Not to mention, the science in this movie is complete BS. I feel like the writers doesn't understand how evolution works. Weekly injections doesn't somehow turn you into a mix of every animal imaginable. Plus, if technology has come so far, to the point where you can manipulate human DNA and genetically engineer a new species, sustainability problem would be the least of your worries.And the concepts and reasoning behind the plot makes even less sense.

The problem therein lies that a committee did this, and had no direction.It is said if you put 50 monkeys in a room with typewriters they will eventually write Shakespeare.We have proof now that it's wrong. It's the script to this movie.Started amazing and strong. Build up to what... swallowing animal DNA and an injection. Even the non genetiscist in the audience knows that ain't gonna work, but hey. We want them to use nitrogen as an energy source rather than oxygen. And to prove it works, we make them sit in a pool and our hero swims like a porpoise to show off. And I won't get into the nitty gritty of why oxygen is an important component in cellular respiration.... if you want to know that Google or Wikipedia it.And thats where it falls apart. No clear direction on the storyline, stunted sub plots that just don't grow, it's a sci fi thriller... with no thrills. The build up the end that didn't make any sense. Can't feel the cold anymore... wonderful. Had to Google about Titan and find out that it's temp is -179.5c on a hot day. So there you go, that's why it's in the plot. But why not explain it? The viewer shouldn't have to go to Google mid viewing to learn that. It rains liquid methane... Oh that's why the atmosphere in the pool area contained methane. That makes sense. Again? Why not explain it to the viewer? The ending seems to borrow special fx from Prometheus. And the character of the creator's in the same movie. But then the ending kinda feels like ""f... it.

Oh how wrong I was! While the acting is pretty good, the whole plot is just an absolute train wreck. We start off on a somewhat hopeful beginning of what could be a good movie. But as the movie progresses, it becomes clear it was never about actually going to a new planet, but creating some mutant/hybrid- which goes from small changes to suddenly being this amphibian winged creature!?

I was entertained throughout until the end when they sent the two test subjects home right before sending them to Titan. Why would they send them home? These test subjects are worth 300million as the scientist said, and he just sends them to their homes as aliens? So the girl test subject kills her husband. I am thinking because she had pent up anger toward him and his views about the science project and having a family. The woman was already in a bad frame of mind from the start. Sending these test subjects home to be with their family one last time is just too asinine for me. Of course all hell breaks lose and the woman test subject is killed and they hunt the male test subject. They find him with his wife at their favorite spot and she wakes up in the hospital. The science guy asks her to give her husband quitiapine to help him forget his earth life and she fakes it and gives him saline instead. So the husband starts fighting and killing and in the end they are all caught and he is sent to Titan anyway. I DON'T GET WHY THEY EVEN DID THAT ENDING PART!!! Why go through all the fighting and killing only to send the man to Titan alone anyway. The movie should have ended when the families came to see them at the base and them send them off to Titan.

361,ankushnarula,Identity Crisis,6,12 April 2018,"The concept of this film is interesting. And for low budget sci-fi it's not awful but it's not great. I liked the world building and the production values weren't overly ambitious so the film had a realistic tone throughout. The performances were fine given what they had to work with.But what begins as a science fiction film is heavily offset by a weak spousal/family drama - which by the third act evolves into an action-horror film - and then back to a spousal drama with a sprinkle of science fiction at the end. The film also can't decide who the main character is until half way through - bouncing between two perspectives until basically settling on one. Several charismatic characters are also introduced early in the film but they add virtually nothing to the plot. And the plot does struggle in the third act.All of this said, the story was good - but the film didn't know how to end - and when it did it really didn't make much sense. I will chalk most of the problems in this film to flimsy production, sloppy and/or time-constrained directing, and frustrated editing with no budget for reshoots.

379,blahsblahjunk,Here's how it ends- all 5 times.,2,3 April 2018,"SPOILER: I'm going to start off by saying that I typically love bad horror movies. I can suspend disbelief like a champion. But this goes beyond hand-waving and into the realm of lunacy. The first 3/4 of the movie were exactly like you'd expect. Set up the experiment, establish the characters, ignore the harbinger, and get down to business. Things look promising and then, of course, things start to go terribly wrong. Unlike most horror movies, though, the characters don't get killed off one at a time. The vast majority of them go down in one fell swoop. And then... then things start getting weird. 
Our hero seems to be the only Titan that *doesn't* die or go mad, and instead does... nothing. He loses the ability to speak and apparently also, the ability to mouth words, gesticulate, write, or do anything except stare meaningfully at his wife. His house is attacked by soldiers who rival Stormtroopers for mass ineptitude, and he just... runs away. 
ENDING ONE
His wife finds him, and they stare into each other's eyes and kiss. A military helicopter flies toward them, fade to white. 
ENDING TWO
The wife wakes up in a hospital bed back on the base. She has lacerations on her face. The head scientist apologizes that she was ""roughed up"" and explains that she needs to convince her husband to go to Titan. He brings her to where the titan is locked in a glass box. 
The head scientist tells her that the titan is refusing to leave because he has too many attachments to earth. He tells her that she needs to give him an injection, which she protests as being a ""lobotomy."" He will forget everything.
The chemical lobotomy is in a special glass vial nestled in a special foam box right next to an identical glass vial labeled SALINE. 
Obviously, she switches the vials. There are an additional ten minutes of unbroken eye contact, and then the wife rushes to leave. Inexplicably, she takes the head doctor with her. The doctor who is the one who did all these experiments and also *lied to her face* about what was happening- now in this very moment becomes one of the good guys. 
Just for good measure, the doctor realizes what happened and shouts ""you switched the vials!"" clarifying the transparent ruse for audience members who may have dozed off during the scene. Behind them, the Titan pauses for dramatic effect and then attacks at the last moment. 
ENDING THREE
The wife and the head doctor pick up the son (played by a mannequin for the rest of the movie) and run full tilt for the exit. They're met there by the injured titan who has escaped and gotten in front of them despite being pursued by about fifty soldiers. 
The head scientist shows up with more soldiers and orders them to shoot our four fleeing heroes. They refuse, and instead turn their guns on the head scientist. Grateful, the wife runs back to the titan and they hug some more. There is no resolution to this scene. 
Not kidding. There is none. 
No explanation for why the head scientist suddenly decided he needed to kill the one successful participant in his experiment. No resolution for the head doctor. No explanation of this base's command structure or what consequences there were for the soldiers who refused to follow orders- if any. Nobody explains what they planned to do with a lobotomized titan in space. No follow up on anything whatsoever. ENDING FOUROpens on an airplane. The titan is in an iron lung and the head doctor is there. Some guy I don't recognize tells the wife that her family is a miracle and that the titan changes everything and 'gives us hope.' Why? No idea. It fades out over a nightime cityscape. ENDING FIVEThe wife is in some kind of lab, analyzing soil samples. She goes outside and looks up into the nighttime sky. The camera zooms in on the sky and then pans to the side a little bit to reveal a huge yellow orb. It's rocky, so... probably not Saturn? 
It cuts back and forth between the wife staring into the night sky and the now-junkless titan standing on what is, presumably, Titan the moon. Also he has wing membranes now so there's that.The music would indicate that this is a dramatic and happy ending. I am... completely baffled. I'm not sure where she was standing, if it was supposed to be out in space somewhere, or if it was back on Earth. I have no idea what he is eating all alone on this moon of his. As far as I can tell, the human race is still more or less doomed. I have no many questions.",The Titan
380,kasperpons,"Interesting start, silly finish",4,4 April 2018,"I wasn't sure what to expect of the film, but when it became clear it was SciFi, I got hooked. As soon as it became clear that the ""superhumans"" all got different DNA changes to adapt to Titan, especially animal dna based, my first thought was about the Isle of Dr Moreaux. It seems so very unrealistic that in a world that is so doomed that there still is so much cover-up and I wonder what kind of tests were done, if they didn't know what each human was going to end up like. Then they finally have 2 humans of the same ""species"", a man and a woman, who, I suppose could reproduce once on Titan, they actually kill the woman, because she is ""dangerous"".

Though you can tell right away the casting and pace is very lack luster, the purposed plot really had too much promise to give up before anything happened. Then nothing happened for most of the movie. For some reason it seems to be more about the unattractive dull stay at home wife then the actual test subject. This actress' acting is not only boring af to match the boring af story but also the relationship between the man and wife is incredibly awkward and unnatural. It looks as though the two lovers could never have been attracted to each other no matter how many ultraufake scenes of them being ""romantic"" they ram in there. lts even more awkwaed when the whole idea is that the bond is so strong that the man gives up his humanity for her and their children's future.

Only that it would make them ""super humans"" They could've made the movie a lot longer. 1. By explaining things better and 2. By having more action. The trailer made it seem like rick is this super human which he is. But that he was hunting the workers. Or atleast it gave me that feeling. Like I thought him hunting them and then hunting him would be a bigger role. They never explained why them changing would make them angrier and easily set off. And when that all happened with the one guys wife. When he killed her. They never tried to counter act the rage part. They didn't do anything about that and then when everyone was in surgery or whatever. All the sudden everyone died except two. They didn't say why that happened and I understand that all of this was uncharted waters for them. But they still never explained what happen. Especially with the girl in the shower.

I like sci fi, but perhaps I sometimes I set the bar a bit too low.
At first I was sligthly intrigued with the premise of the story. The Earth ecosystem goes down the drain and scientists plan to save humanity by mutating it so that it can survive in the very inhospitable environment of a moon of Saturn. Cool!
Right. But wait. Why can't they gradually mutate people so that they can adjust to the seemingly not so dramatic changes of the Earth climate? Come on, how long before the Earth becomes worse than Titan? Very cold, no oxygen, only methane, and really really far? Ok, maybe the experiment was a sort of proof of concept.

Like seriously, the movie starts off by training a few people so they can live on Saturn which then later turns to Titan instead of Saturn?
Then the cliche Evil-Scientist experiments on the MC. His wife finds some cameras and blood tests and stuff like that like ALL wives do and complains about her husband.
Then , after her husband turns into some kind of mutant freak, she seriously rejects the offer of sending him to another planet because that's the only way he can live. Like WITAF?????!??!!?? How could she NOT send him to his only survival planet and instead keep him on earth to die?Another thing is there are actually 2 people that successfully survived from the whole procedure. Interestingly, the other person who survived killed her husband while the MC did not???? Unfair much?

This movie is to be avoided at all costs. The actors and the acting is hugely forgettable.

427,deestieltrash,what did i just watch ??,3,23 April 2021,"Really REALLY enjoyed the first 40ish minutes. Love this type of scifi-evolution-scientific experiment-undertones of psychological horror type of media, been in love with it since I read the Russian sleep experiment in middle school.Around the 40 minute point is where it starts to get downright atrocious - a genuine laughing stock compared to any other media I have consumed in this specific subgenre. And that says a lot considering how easily impressed I usually am by these types of stories.I would have preferred the characters been killed off gradually, but honestly that's a matter of taste more than anything. I completely understood the plot point of them all dying in surgery. It looked and sounded complicated, like they were removing an entire hormone-secreting gland or something or other, at least that's how I rationalized it. The pseudoscience in this was overwhelming but tasteful, up to right after this.When they get out of surgery I almost immediately lost interest. Why did they need to alter their appearance so drastically? Why did they need to steal their ability to communicate in any meaningful way? (How are they supposed to communicate with people on Earth once they reach Titan?) Cheap tactic at making them appear more animalistic. It's not like a wider head and misshapen enlarged bridge and no ears will increase survival chances.Not to mention they had just gotten done with surgery and were fully healed apparently? I have no idea how long ear-removal wounds would take to heal, but his eyes being altered were more of a plot point than an entire external appendage being removed. And after this they just let them go home? They should have kept them inside the facility for futher tests. This was, after all, a major surgery. As we clearly see.Killing off Tally made no sense, especially since she is the only person who can actually communicate with Rick now. Her killing her husband made no sense. At the one hour point, about where Abi goes and finds Rick after he runs away, I paused to check how long was left and was stunned to see there was a little less than half the movie left. Had no idea how they could drag it out past that point, but they managed to.I think enough has been said about the poor multi-endings. This is just what bothered me.

Maybe the script writer expected us to read between the lines or something. There is no explanation as in how will a modified specie will help the existing over population on earth. May be the point was just to let a new specie establish it's own habitat on Titan and forget about the existing humans on earth. This way we will know for sure that life would exist in the universe just not in human form (damn I knew that scientist was evil). During the final minutes when I had some hope of something cool happening, they killed the female Titan. I mean WTF. How will the new specie produce its offspring on Titan.

441,jmeade-51-83352,So much potential,5,30 March 2018,"Acting, check. Relevant to today, check. Good storyline... let's settle on decent.
This movie would have been great except for a few things:
1) What the Science? Everything about this movie is just full of holes scientifically, and it's a SciFi. Go figure. The whole thing is a biology experiment, but the test subjects are just chilling with families and friends chugging beers etc. Some people go crazy and kill their family, but the rest just get to hang with their own families. Doctors collecting blood samples in contaminated pill bottles, tests go from reducing oxygen to super swimming instantaneously... I could go on. 
2) yeeeha USA. Everything is glamour army this, honour and duty that. Survivors of the war. It's the Pentagon, NASA, US Army. PB&J sandwiches. BBQ and throwing the football around. Yep our last hope is the USA of course, everyone get on board. Cliche overload. 
3) someone changed the end. The whole story made sense till the end series of scenes. Suddenly the doctor that was concerned about the world and the investment in his experiments was going to suddenly kill the people he was trying to save and the experiment worth so much time and money. All the bad guys became good, the good experiment kills a bunch of people for some reason, but the now good army people don't mind (after shooting the last bad experiments) and let him love and send him to Titan. Instantly apparently because the kid doesn't age. Of and they send him with a bunch of spaceships or something as they're whipping round Titan in the closing scenes. Remote control obviously because there is only one experiment left and he is standing on the planet watching them. Could have been such a good movie.
Character development was great.
Acting was great.
Special effects were great.
Story was decent ... until for some reason they hollywooded the end.",The Titan
442,sephiroth-cristian-135-726536,Just Another Trailer Movie,3,30 March 2018,"I feel cheated out of my time for watching this. Because aside from what we are shown in the trailer, the movie has little more to surprise us or answer any of the questions we might have.Soundtrack
Appropriate for this movie, it does a good job of setting the right mood in the beginning, but falls off towards the end and you forget it's even there.Acting
Even though sometimes the lines don't make sense and their characters are one dimensional through and through, the acting is solid and the actors do a decent job at delivering their lines.Costume Design/Effects/CG
Minimal effects and CG. They are not bad but also nothing to talk about either (or think about the moment the movie ended). 
The final form of the enhanced human is quite plain, and subtle in portraying it's enhancements (too subtle). One would argue that it was made like this so that CG on Titan would be easier. While this might be true, the 20 seconds of Titan we see at the end does not justify this enough.
(The butt of a spaceship leaving Earth would have been a more rewarding ending scene for me than seeing the titan on Titan)Story
Next is the spoiler heavy part of my review. (although it's hard to spoil what's already been explained in the trailer)
First off I will start by saying that, for a sci-fi movie, the story is weak, very weak, and bland. Almost none of the questions that a sci-fi fan like myself might have are answered and those that do get explained are given unsatisfying answers. 
So for questions like ""How do you get to Titan and how long it takes to get there, what is the enhanced humans mission once they get there, what will they eat, where will they sleep?"" there will be no answers whatsoever. 
(""Through the power of science"" and ""it's their problem"" seems to be the unwritten, unspoken answer. Really? Not even a hint? )
And for questions like ""How are the humans enhanced to survive Titan and what will they be like?"" the answers are shaky at best. 
Through a series of injections and rigorous training the humans will adapt to the inhuman conditions of Titan (irony right there). So far so good, I can get behind this. 
We are then explained how the new humans will use more nitrogen from the air to breathe in the new atmosphere. Great! 
And then we are shown how the subjects can hold their breath under water for a very long time and become amazing swimmers. Wait what? I get how switching from oxygen to nitrogen will help breathing in the new environment but why would they be able to hold their breath that much longer (wouldn't they would be using nitrogen at the same rate as oxygen? and why should they hold their breath for so long in the first place?)
Later we find out these injections ""mutate"" the human body giving it animal traits that help the humans survive in their new home (as to how and why these animal traits are helpful and/or relevant, your guess is as good as mine). This is where the movie starts to get philosophical on us, making us question our humanity and that of the subjects undergoing ""forced evolution"" (which I suspect was the pitch for this whole movie).
In the final stage of the evolution we are shown the complete form of the Titan man. Alright, I will accept it as it is. Then we are told they are now communicating at low frequency and through touch, undetectable to humans. 
(OK I can understand developing another form of communication between themselves, but have they lost all understanding and knowledge of the human language? can't they write, type, wave, smile or show any form of emotion?)
This is the point where the movie loses it's grasp on logic (in my humble opinion). It would have us believe the subjects have lost their humanity and are going feral. This quickly builds to a disappointing climax that makes absolutely no sense.
The protagonist tries to escape (where?). Is captured, caged, then with the help of his wife escapes, again (where? to what end?). Then, in a room filled armed soldiers, the lead scientist, who up until now has been protecting his creations, calls for the execution of the protagonist and his family (who are human and the wife is a friend of the scientist) and the base leader refuses, who up until now had been arguing to terminate the subjects if they become a threat (which they have; and he could have easily shot just the protagonist and spare the civilians). And the reason for this execution is that the subjects needed to be controlled or everyone dies (humanity I guess?). 
(From this point no further explanation is given and what's more infuriating is that the movie simply skips over this moment and just shows us our protagonist on a plane with his family, then on Titan, just surviving? The end...of anyone being interested in a sequel for this movie I guess)To finally end this long review, The Titan ""tries"" to answer questions I'm not asking and leaves way too many obvious question unanswered. It's not something I would re-watch or recommend and since it's on Netflix, I'm giving it a thumbs down.P.S. This movie's motto should be:
""Through the power of science, love and family, one man accepts to be left stranded butt naked on Titan. To save humanity.""",The Titan

As they obviously lower the expectations, I find myself often astonished and taken away by the things I see, compared to what I have read.  It is not the perfect movie but what is? One can always argue about the profoundness of characters and the performances of the cast. For me, the introduction to the topic is interesting, the location is the Canary Island of Gran Canaria is the perfect setting, and the cast makes the best out of a good idea, which is not told as it should have been.

It touches something inside of us that makes us to react so violently, to argue and to try to destroy a piece or art (an expression)...
I understand some of the critics related to the cinematographic composition of this film that would tend to qualify it as very poor. Indeed, some turns in the plot/characters are astonishingly odd and disappointing, like those that any person would endure during a DNA experiment or even a long space trip. In other words, this film could be a representation of what it means to bring nonsense and control-less turns into a control-freak earth. A film-test for viewers on resilience to change and openness to the unknown of our species, on earth or elsewhere, by challenging our self-inflicted expectations on cinematography.",The Titan
452,stevennijman,"It has the hammer, it just doesn't strike the anvil",3,30 March 2018,"Sam Worthington, whom we all know and like from Avatar, just can't seem to get enough of transforming to something different. He has a decent performance as Rick Janssen, a stoic and likeable soldier who was handpicked to be one of the first of the human species to travel to Titan, a moon orbiting Saturn.The start of the movie is decent enough and presents the premise of the story well with decent anecdotes about how the earth has become unhabitable to humans. The last hail mary of earth is shown early in the movie and is, by movie standards, unique enough. Rather than creating an earth we can all live on, we simply try and bend nature's will by creating superhumans that are able to live on the much more unhabitable Titan. This begs the question why we don't change humans to be able to live on Earth though.. Whilst different from other similar sci-fi movies, I actually liked how the movie immediately jumped into energetic and exciting preparation of sending men into space. Whilst the idea was, in my eyes, very farfetched and unrealistic the movie did a great job in hiding its ludicrousness. Up to this point I was intrigued and was certain the part in space would make the movie much more interesting. I was especially looking forward to the arrival on Titan. Except.. that part never came.The movie haphazardly tries to give a few scenes in which the soldiers are introduced, but it never really sticks. To be honest I can't remember any of their names. There are some attempts with Janssen's family to create a feeling of unease and trepidation, but that also doesn't really stick. At that point in the movie it still felt as a one-for-all, all-for-one idea. We, mankind, versus the unhabitable earth (of which we don't see much at the training facility, to be fair) and space.Rather than fullfilling its promising start, the movie director seems to have changed his mind and quickly came up with an alternative scenario. One in which the antogonist is not the concept of space or the challenges of progress and evolution. No, the antogonist is quite simply a shady scientist, one who tries his best to spent billions on his, apparent, pseudo-science. It's a shame really.The movie slowly dies off as it is unable to keep up with its own science and simply starts presenting 'sciency words' as fact. At some point, for which I would not be surprised to learn that it is the reason why the movie is so short, they simply start to kill off characters by the dozen to quickly follow through with the remainder of the story. I think the director realized at some point that they never thought of an answer to the question: 'why should anyone care?'. Don't even get me started about the pointlessness of the last scene, in which our stoic soldier can suddenly fly?!There is much more to be said about the movie which I won't talk about, as this review is already too long. I guess Sam's acting is decent, Taylor Schilling does an okay job with the poor dialogue that was written.Still really do not recommend.",The Titan

456,carlos-a-hiciano,I guess humanity is doomed? Why all the poor choices in the 3rd act?,3,6 April 2018,"I actually enjoyed watching the movie up until the third act. 
The set up was intriguing. It was engaging and interesting up until the near end. The third act is when I lost my suspense of disbelief.There's a moment at the end of the second act where Rick Janssen, The protagonist and successful experiment has a major medical emergency. He goes into surgery. We also see all of the other subjects including Tally Rutherford, go into surgery as well. It seems without this surgery, they would all die.During this surgery montage we see that the majority of the participants have died except our protagonist Rick and Tally. Rick's wife, Abi now gets to see her husband. We can now see Rick and Tally completely altered humans. They have evolved past their human state. This is a really interesting moment...then....for whatever reason...the lead scientist, Martin says ""They can go home...""What?....Your experiment is successful and you don't want to monitor or study your experiment anymore?...you know that beings with this DNA can be violent and yet you want to release it back to the public? You're not worried that your subjects could be harmed or potentially die in an unsupervised environment?This is a stupid, stupid decision by the head scientist of this experiment.This movie upsets me because it had SO much potential to be great. 
This movie started out with the premise of the survival of the human species. It seemed as if Professor Martin's goal was for human kind to survive outside of earth. He's the good guy...but the third act suddenly made Martin the antagonist...this was completely unwarranted. The third act became less about humanity as a whole and focused on the individual experiences of what Rick and his wife Abi wanted.It's turning point of ""They can go home.."" that really bothers me. Mainly because if this hadn't had happened, they probably wouldn't have been violent and killed people. The Titans should have been quarantined and supervised until both Titan Rick and Titan Tally could be shipped off to Saturn's moon.Sending Titan Rick and Titan Tally home just caused unneeded action scenes....If the producers really wanted an action scene, they could have had it while the titans were supervised at the base.I was under the impression that Rick and Tally would be shipped off to Titan to further the species of human kind. It would have been best if it went that direction. This would create turmoil for Titan Rick to leave earth and leave his wife for the sake of all man kind.
That would have made a better story in my opinion.The second thing that made me throw my hands up in frustration was the part in the third act when the lead scientist asked Abi to give Rick this serum that would erase his memories...
Why would they ask Abi to do this ? Rick is already quarantined in a cage..can't your army guys use a tranquilizer gun? Or can't you restrained Rick even more so he doesn't attack? 
I don't understand why this high end top secret experimental facility would rely on the subjects wife to give him a solution. I think these people have the resources to make that happen without his wife...She then switches the drug and runs away. There's a chase scene and
now the lead scientist and army have cornered Rick, Abi, their kid and for some reason Martin's partner Dr. Freya.Martin then orders his lackeys to shoot them and they decide against it?
Why? Because they don't want to kill a women and child. That's fair. 
But at the same time, Isn't all of humanity at stake here? Abi is now selfishly ""saving"" her husband for what? I thought Abi knew that Rick would evolve and be shipped off to titan. Why is there resistance from her?We're told that in 10 years or so most of humanity will starve and most of earth will be uninhabitable...this would make it seem that this is their only shot to save their species. It would seem that Prof. Martin is then making a huge sacrifice for all of humanity...why make him the antagonist in the end here?This story went off the rails in the third act. I could have instead liked to have seen a story about the individual sacrifice for humanity instead. Tally Shouldn't have died. What should have happened after the surgery scene was Rick resisting because he's told he has to repopulate titan with tally. Rick being angry about this decision made on his behalf. Rick resisting and becoming violent (this way the producers can have their action scene). Scientists and soldiers sedate him and force him and Tally to go off to titan. Abi's turmoil and emotional sacrifice to let this happen. Then finally, you can have both happy endings where we see Rick and Tally on Titan adjusting to the environment, and also scientist back on earth implementing the titan projects to civilians etc.  I don't write these movies so they don't come out how I'd wish they would...All in all, the ending just seems horrible. 
We see Dr. Abi ambiguously working on something. We're led to believe it's a continuation of the Titan project....
 Then...we see Rick...alone on Titan....I guess he needs to be there to survive...but what is he going to do there all alone?Anyway, I don't usually write reviews, but this third act messed with my suspense of disbelief so much that I had to write it out.
I don't think I'd recommend this movie.and for the filmmakers,

With climate disaster looming, genetic engineering of our species to withstand an uninhabitable planet ( like our own) is not that far fetched. Sequence of events is somewhat disjointed and unclear how the new species was allowed to rocket to Titan after killing a number of people.This myth may very well give us a glimpse of our future and presage the exigencies and calamities that will eventually inspire the advent of genetically engineered ""superhumans,"" or ""transhumans.""

Why a surgery can induce so much physical, macro changes? And why does it have to be done in one surgery? Is it because of the crew ran out of money so they can't design makeups for what's in the middle?6. Abi does not wear lab coats and eye protections in the lab! OSHA is not gonna be happy. Wear your PPE!7. I don't understand why movies just always take a stance/theme against the transformation of human. The Titan is just showing the viewers every BAD about the Homo Titaniens, almost nothing positive about it. Is human body's god's/a supernatral's work that we will be punished if we modify it?

508,aernst-40480,"Too many ""Why's?""",4,21 April 2018,"Before I get into the movie itself, let me say this. The movie had a lot of potential, but it never came to fruition. The rating on this should probably be lower. I can't even say how many reviews I read (it was a lot) but of the positive reviews, probably 80% of them had some form of ""it's not that bad"" as the title. They then gave it a higher rating than they felt it deserved. A movie that ""isn't as bad"" as people are claiming doesn't deserve a 7 or 8 rating. I read one review where the person gave it a 10/10 and claimed they did it to combat all the 1/10 rating it received. 4/10 isn't some terrible, worst movie of the century rating. It is slightly below average. 
 As for the movie itself, I'm going to keep it short. The above is mainly what I needed to say. But anyway. Once it was finished I mainly felt confused. I shouldn't say just at the end, most of the movie will have you feeling this way. More and more things keep happening, but you never really get told why. Here's a list of questions I had while watching (what I can think of off the top of my head at least):
-right off the bat they can all of a sudden go 30-45 minutes without breathing. Which is confusing because they had just described how they were going to make it so their bodies would require a lower percentage of oxygen in the air. Oh, and they can swim like dolphins even though nothing physical has changed about them. 
-He has an episode where he is sweating and burning up and can't cool down. This is due to their bodies changing to accommodate titans colder weather. After this scene it is never an issue again. 
-one of the subjects begins to become violent, and they say this was one of the potential, even likely side effects. Nobody else becomes violent. Except for the same guy when he kills his wife. And one other thing, but that will be further down. 
-Sonmany people are going to make it! Just one surgery left and their transformation is complete! Wait, everyone but two people died in the home stretch. All of apparently very different reasons but at the same time. Oh well, Adam and Eve scenario. 
-they leave for titan tomorrow, say your goodbyes now. Just kidding, go home to your families unsupervised even though you are basically a new creature and we know nothing about you. 
-after showing 0 signs of aggression, female titan kills her husband and goes to male titans house. They have awkward maybe intimate moment. She is then shot and killed. Just adam I guess. 
-from this point we have like 5 pseudo endings, you realize that at some point the researcher who was trying to save humanity randomly became a bad guy for some reason, his assistant switched sides and is now against him, you also realize that everything that has happened so far is more or less exactly what he signed up for and don't know why everyone is fighting..... oh ok were done. Time for the final ending. 
-wifey is in some lab working on something, you aren't told what. You also don't know where they are. Presumably still earth. Human titan is now on titan. All alone and with no clothing.....or reproductive organs. All nice and smooth. And all alone. With what appears to be no other forms of life. But he can fly all of a sudden, so that's nice. I know I started rambling at the end, but that's because that's how this movie felt. I kind of apologize for the length of this, but also kind of not, I just needed something to do before work.",The Titan

519,MrMelcusake,From hero to zero.,1,30 March 2018,"This is how I would describe this total nonsense. At the beginning the movie starts with an interesting idea, about the possibility of mutating human DNA with the help of science to assimilate the atmospheric conditions found on Titan to accommodate human beings on another world, but as the plot develops it becomes obvious that this movie it's going to end in a free fall.After seeing half of the movie you start to wonder when is it actually starting, but then you will be surprised by a generous mix of animal superpowers that are injected into our main character, which is having an internal struggle of leaving his family on Earth. Then, the chosen ones start to drop like flies, one after the other, each suffering from various mutations that are affecting the body, the latter having troubles of assimilating the vaccines. The leading program scientist has a hidden agenda, without telling the subjects that they were injected with some enzymes that is awakening something inside them, but that hidden agenda is discovered by the detective wife (which is conveniently a super doctor that can see what is going on with her husband). Then humans transform to Titan creatures, some of them killing their loved ones (even though they were fully conscious about their surroundings). Wife saves the day, having a firing platoon that is disobeying the program director direct orders and she somehow manages to keep the main character alive. The hole scenarios goes up in the air, when the dolphin like character develops wings at the ending scene (when he finally reaches Titan) and ends the scene with a Superman like flight over the dark scenery of Titan.

Well, being a Sci-Fi fan, I got through these decisive 15 minutes and should have listened to the warning signs: Nuclear, white pinboard family with typical role clichés (strong, protective father; caring, loving mother; lovely son) and other Hollywood stereotypes (army camp base, secret NATO operation, barbecue with neighbours although half of the world is said to collapse), but I thought to give it a try. My patience experienced its own armageddon when the mother, doing some housework, talks to the female neighbour from next door about how brave their husbands are and that they should be proud because they are heroes.Good science-fiction is supposed to pose critical questions on current reality and raise not only technological or moral, but also social questions. Probably the writers were not aware of this when making an aleatory copy-paste of the 200 most common phrases of other movies.

I haven't seen a bad sci-fi movie like that in ages, and as an enthusiast of the genre I cannot find the words to describe the feeling of waste of time and money, the feeling of an insult The Titan made me feel. The premise - a dystopian future reality flirting with human DNA manipulation to push us to the stars - seems interesting, although a little cliché, and at the beginning I had faith it was going to develop and become an interesting experience. My mistake! The plot is absolutely outrageous, predictable, full of gaps, a real offense to any intelligent brain, without a single plausible reasoning or argument to sustain it. The most cliché structures were there: the fearless ultra-viril hero that had everything to be super violent but sticks to the most sterile and flat concept of love, the conformed and abdicating wife that moves mountains to serve as her husband doormat, the kid that serves only to convince the walls that ""if somebody is a parent, then that somebody is a good person"", the CGI/aesthetics trying desperately to fill the eyes with the content that was not provided to the mind or the emotions, and so on. The psychologic dimension of the characters made me cry - of boredom, disappointment or angry! I still cannot understand how a movie that deals with the concept of deep transformation can end up at an incredible shallow and miserable perspective of a tremendous human change - it's literally all about the skin.

In other words, they tend to have quite predictable stories.The plot isn't that bad overall, it just needed some tweaking to make it heaps better. For instance, the ending could have been an Adam and Eve-esque premise where the only two surviving experiments were to lose their memories during the process and are sent to Titan after a violent confrontation with the military.

We'll just have to find something else to do. Not sure what that is yet, maybe read a book or play cards or something. Hollywood's bad enough with the trash they churn out these days.

But then; what feels like hours for a build-up, for 4 minutes of action.All i have left are questions.
Why send one Lone person up there?
It seems like they want to continue this work, but in the build-up, evereyone was against this method.
Out of the 16(?) that participated in this project, only two (in the end, one) survived.
It seems like this whole ""too many people on earth-problem"" is going to sort itself out if they continue this method.To sum it up;
They poured themself a nice glass of good scotch, and wrote the plot.
They were starting to get hammered through out the film.
They blacked out during the action.
And they wrote the ending with a massive ""STFU-Hangover"".",The Titan

(great movie) And instead give you a cop-out ending and no real Sci-Fi. (just some genetic manipulation for the main character)

551,annikamb,Wasted promise - could have been so good,1,10 April 2018,"This started out so promising - dark future, sci-fi, actors I like, cool premise. 
And then we got about 2/3 in, and suddenly it tanked. Crashed and burned.
From cool physical changes and worrisome mental ones, we immediately went full on ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" or something. 
How they managed to go from ""he's got hyper senses, his brain can't cope, he needs surgery"" to ""and now he's COMPLETELY morphed into this fishman, communicates on a different frequency and by the way - he's a tentacle monster as well"" in the space of minutes, with no satisfactory explanation what so ever, is beyond me. 
That's where the movie broke for me. 
As far as we can tell, we have a non-sexual (suddenly genitalia-less?), non-human tentacle-monster flying around Titan, and that's supposed to give humanity hope HOW? If they're capable of creating weird creatures adapted to a hostile environment, then couldn't they just do that on Earth? Capable of living in the Arctic, endure radiation, live on sunlight and microbes?
Will this new species of post-human even be able to breed?
This ending makes so little sense - I'd have liked it a LOT more if the last changes were more subtle and slow (and didn't involve tentacles) and we got to se our hero constructing a habitat and performing scientific tests, maybe trying to grow a crop on Titan; there is no mention of how he will survive on a lifeless moon...",The Titan

Their decision to go through this process is never shown so we miss a crucial event in their relationship. They mention all these science things but never actually explain them. The actual pitch that is later referenced is never shown so we are left with the impression that they go exactly what they signed up for but now are regretting it. At one point the wife becomes a super smart doctor lady with no warning. She just out of no where starts throwing questions and stuff at an actual scientist. Then any possible interesting story with side characters immediately die just like they do. And to top it off, their master plan to save humanity is to send this one ""evolved"" dude to Saturn's moon. How the hell does that help us? Everyone is still on earth but one dude, who doesn't even have junk any more, is now in space so we are saved. But wait there is more, he can fly. I don't know why but he can. Also be has worms coming out of his hands and they are how he talks but they are also knives. And for some reason everyone but him goes crazy and kills people .he still kills people but because they want to send him to Titan, which is something he wants to do so why is he resisting them.

Which, in the 21st century is an insult to all the high tech they're dependent on. Millennial are now the workforce and grew up with smartphones. Unfortunately some producer or director couldn't figure that out.

567,not-my-real-name,"Great acting, special effects are cool, horrible script",5,7 September 2018,"Just watched Titan and wow, it made me angry. I rarely write movie reviews, but this one moved me to action. Since Netflix no longer allows reviews on its site, here's my first IMDB review. This crappy script is a waste of excellent acting talent and awesome special effects. Kudos to the actors who did the best they could with an uneven script, faux-science, WTF scenes and progressively more stilted dialogue. The movie isn't bad for the first 45 minutes. I had figured out it wasn't going to have a satisfying ending by that point, but I wanted to see how they'd spin it, so I kept going. The faux-science was fun to eye-roll over. But then our hero soldiers finally go through the full metamorphosis (after a ""what? why did they need surgery?"" scene) and are unable to talk, change facial expressions, write, or in any other way communicate except by ""sonar and touch"".And from that point, the script went completely into a FTW-WERE-YOU-THINKING tailspin. So many stupid actions in such a short time can make a movie-watcher dizzy. The coup-de-grace was the final 18 minutes. It's like the producers said, ""Let's just do a few disassociated scenes. No one is watching anymore, anyway."" I lost track of how many times I said, ""Wait, what?"" So many times. Netflix, fess up. Is this steaming pile of a movie, and your other original programming, the reason you no longer allow reviews? If you can't handle poor reviews, improve your quality management. Now you've forced people to find other public forums to air their opinions. That probably means fewer positive reviews (because why go to the effort when we liked the movie?), more negative reviews (because we want to warn people away from bad ones) and lower ratings (because we're mad about having to click to another site to leave the review).",The Titan
