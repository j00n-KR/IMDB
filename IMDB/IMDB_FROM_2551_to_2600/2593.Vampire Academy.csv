0,Leofwine_draca,A trash fest populated by excruciating actors,2,20 October 2016,"I suppose the premise for VAMPIRE ACADEMY, the latest vampire-themed young adult film adapted from a book, is TWILIGHT meets HARRY POTTER. That's certainly the theme here as the plot involves age-old aristocratic vampires, both good and bad, and the students of a vampire academy who swot up on vampire lore.What it amasses to isn't very much at all. This is a weak emulation of a typical American high school movie complete with grating British accents and some truly horrid performances from the young cast members. Indeed, some of the actors in this I found completely excruciating, particularly the leads. Their dialogue sounds hollow and feels false, which is little surprise considering how it aches to be oh-so-hip and down with the kids.As is usual for this genre, a couple of old-timers are wheeled out like forgotten waxworks; Joely Richardson and Gabriel Byrne are the ones foolish enough to sign up in this case. Olga Kurylenko is here too, although she has so little screen time that I wonder why she bothered showing up on the day. The whole film is a joke from start to finish, with rubbish direction and some of the fakest fight scenes I can remember watching. The only wonder comes from wondering why they bothered shooting it in the first place.",Vampire Academy
1,SnoopyStyle,another bad YA series,5,18 November 2014,"Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) is a Dhampir. Dhampirs protect the Moroi who are kinda vampires. Rose had run away from St Vladimir's Academy with her Moroi friend Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry). They have a rare psychic connection. Lissa is the last of the Dragomirs and in line for the crown. They are brought back to the Academy where they face mean girls, convoluted politics, and the ever threatening Strigoi who are turned-evil violent powerful vampire creatures. The Moroi learn to control the basic elements while the Dhampir learn to fight.It's yet another one of these YA series and more expositions of new terminology to get through. It's enough to turn off anybody. The story throws everything at the viewers. It's a jumble mess. The Academy is reminiscent of Hogwarts except less magical and less interesting. It's also got the modernity setup in a mishmash of styles. The mean girls aspect is simplistic. The writing is not really up to standard. Zoey Deutch tries to bring some interest with a jokey fast-talking sarcastic girl but it's been done better. That's probably the only part that holds any promise and differentiate itself from all the other YA series. It's as if Ellen Page's Juno got dropped into one those franchises. Even though she doesn't succeed, she's still somewhat interesting and the only reason why I would rate this marginally better than the other sludge. Very marginally...",Vampire Academy
2,claudio_carvalho,Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Vampires,6,6 July 2014,"The teenagers Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and Vasilisa ""Lissa"" Dragomir (Lucy Fry) are best friend and escapee from the St. Vladimir's Academy for more than one year. When the guardian Dimitri Belikov (Danila Kozlovsky) from the St Vladimir's Academy and his team find the girls, they bring them back to the academy. Rose is a Dhampir, a good half human-half vampire breed that can eat regular food and are trained to protect the Moroi from the evil immortal vampires Strigoi. Lissa is a Princess of the Moroi, a good mortal breed of vampires that feed of blood from donors and is capable to control one of the four elements. When they return, the Headmistress Kirova (Olga Kurylenko) intends to punish Rose, but the old Moroi Victor Dashkov (Gabriel Byrne), who was a friend of Lissa's family, dissuades Kirova from her intent. Lissa dates her outcast schoolmate Christian Ozera (Dominic Sherwood) but unexpectedly she is threatened by someone that wishes to harm her. Victor's daughter Natalie (Sarah Hyland) joins Rose and Lissa to help them to seek out who might be the enemy.""Vampire Academy"" is an entertaining fantasy with a story that is a sort of combination of ""Harry Potter"" with ""Twilight"". Zoey Deutch is gorgeous and charming and if the viewer sees this feature with low expectation, he or she might have a pleasant surprise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Academia de Vampiros: O Beijo das Sombras"" (""Vampire Academy: The Shadow Kiss"")",Vampire Academy
3,nogodnomasters,THINKING IS FOR LOSERS,10,31 July 2018,"Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) is a Dhampir, half human/vampire. She guards Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry) a Moroi. The Moroi are peaceful mortal vampires who perform magic based on the elements. Rose guards Lissa from bloodthirsty, immortal Vampires, the Strigoi. Rose steals Lissa, who is also a princess, from the academy as they hide out, only to be discovered and returned to St. Vladimir, the Hogwarts for vampires.Like the Harry Potter series, in addition to dealing with serious life and death issues, our girls must cope with being a teen and all the puns that go with being a vampire. Yes, the stakes are high. Zoey Deutch gives us a refreshing performance and I haven't been so much in love since Jordana Brewster in D.E.B.S. The plot has some good unveiling.This is fun teen film.Parental Guide: No nudity. One near F-bomb. Brief sexual situations",Vampire Academy
4,kosmasp,Back to school,5,2 November 2014,"If you think the tag line (suck at school) is funny, this may appeal more to you than to others. But while this isn't the worst movie of 2014 (I think someone should either watch more movies or at least be a bit more fair), it is filled with clichés from beginning to end. Plus it has a target group and it does fill the needs of that special group more than anything else.I don't think I have to spell out to whom that is aimed at (the movie itself quoting directly or indirectly Twilight many times). But if you look past that (or maybe just because of that), you can see an effort to make this light and fun at the same time. Actors can not really be judged by this alone, but they don't really put the breaks to the movie, so that's a positive. You know what you're getting, don't complain about it later ...",Vampire Academy
5,paul_haakonsen,It sucked alright...,3,1 May 2014,"Clearly I wasn't in the target audience for ""Vampire Academy"". This movie is clearly aimed at a young audience who is still starstruck because of ""Twilight"" and seeing vampires as something of a pop culture phenomena.The story is about vampires - well, sort of in the sense that they need blood to stay alive. There are two species of these blood-drinkers, one good, one bad (duh!). Having run away from the vampire academy, the princess of vampires is living in the mortal world with her dhampir protector. But the people from the academy soon catch up with them, and they have to go back to the academy. But a war is brewing and a conflict is lurking on the sunless horizon.Storywise, then I guess ""Vampire Academy"" was adequate if you are in the particular target audience. I, however, found it to be laughable and stupid.The effects in the movie were good, I will say that much. But it just didn't cut it enough to lift up the movie for me.As for the people on the cast list, well, people were doing good jobs with their given roles.""Vampire Academy"" is another addition to the teenage vampire fanatic wave that was sparked with ""Twilight"", despite the movie even throwing a punch at the sparkly vampires in ""Twilight"".If you are a teenage girl, then by all means go for this movie. Otherwise, it is not really worth the time and effort.",Vampire Academy
6,anaconda-40658,It Fails on All Levels!,1,6 May 2015,"Vampire Academy (2014): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Zoey Deutch, Lucy Fry, Dominic Sherwood, Gabriel Byrne, Danila Kozlovsky: One suspects that the title references control within inner struggles but the only inner struggle I had was remaining in my seat during the entire running time. Mark Waters once directed one of the great teen flicks, Mean Girls. Here he makes perhaps his worst film and it's a declining quality in the same vein as his Head Over Heels and Mr. Popper's Penguins. It is vampires in college and it has no fun with the concept. It is like a bad version of Harry Potter with visual effects that look about as enticing as if someone threw up all over the movie screen. We have three dozen different vampire species with each one more vicious than the last. Lucy Fry plays some sort of teen vampire Princess who can restore life. Too bad she couldn't restore dignity to the film. Zoey Deutch is a stunning young actress with a knack for sarcasm but this does her no justice. She protects the Princess and spends much of the film in combat or having idiotic sex due to an enchanted necklace. Dominic Sherwood plays a vampire of sorts who can make fire. His powers can be used to burn every copy of this teen peep show. Veteran actor Gabriel Byrne appears with a withering body but his talent seems to be withering more. Of all the films based on young adult novels or such, this just may be the worst of the bunch. Mark Waters will always have Mean Girls. That is fortunate since this flimsy fang bearing piece of junk should be set aflame and urinated upon when it turns to ash. Score: 1 / 10",Vampire Academy
7,siderite,I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of it!,4,8 May 2014,"I watch a lot of crap, from series to films, but this film is disgustingly bad. At first I thought it was a spoof film, something a film student created in their spare time and capitalized on the name of a real film, but no: that's the actual movie. The acting was so abysmally bad, the dialogue so ridiculous and the special effect so ""special"" that after 10 minutes I stopped watching it. Maybe it was more like 5 minutes.Whatever you do, don't watch this. And if you think the girls are young and cute and you might enjoy it for this reason alone, they are not that hot, really. A lose lose situation, so to speak.",Vampire Academy
8,StevePulaski,A witless slog of events and emotionless dialog,3,21 May 2014,"I'm a firm believer in an entering every film I watch with an open mind, regardless of whether or not it's regarded as one of the greatest films of all time or is one of the worst reviewed films ever made. Contrary to the idea that people think I enter some films more contentiously than others, what purpose is their for me to walk into a film with the mentality to dislike it? That's a waste of my precious time and money. I'll voice my expectations based on the trailer and promotional details that I see, but when it comes time to walk down the lengthy theater aisles to find a seat, press play on the DVD, or hit ""confirm purchase"" on Pay-Per-View, you can bet I'm ready to be entertained and spend my next hour and a half or two hours enjoying what I'm viewing.With that being said, upon sitting through the first ten minutes of Vampire Academy, the latest teen movie that clearly had hopes of becoming the next big young adult franchise but fell well short of expectations, it was hard to maintain optimism much longer, but I tried. By thirty minutes, I was lost in the film's wooden dialog and variety of underdeveloped subplots, and by the hour mark, it was a struggle to stay awake. This is not only one of the worst films of 2014 just because of the fact that it takes a potentially interesting subject that could've been made to house some hilarious satire on teenagers and makes the material about as bland as a day-old bowl of oatmeal.The film concerns a seventeen-year-old human/vampire hybrid (also known as a ""Dhampir"") Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and her friend Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry), who is a peaceful, mortal vampire (also known as a ""Moroi""). The two escaped from their boarding school two years prior to where we see them now and are trying to live in our world as peacefully and as nonchalantly as they can. By a twisted turn of events, they are brought back to the Academy and realize that the vampire academy they left doesn't seem so different from the regular high school experience, with rumors, backstabbing, lies, cheating, and so on all taking place as prevalently as ever. While trying to combat these malevolent forces, Rose also finds herself attracted to her Dhampir mentor by the name of Dimitri Belikov (Danila Kozlovsky).Such a premise - on paper - sounds as if it is establishing the building blocks for a wickedly funny and relevant satire on teenage convention; almost like a Mean Girls for a more artistic or mainstream crowd. However, it's a true shame that writer Daniel Waters sells the material short (or, given that it's based off a book, maybe it's not entirely his fault and he's staying true to source material) and concocts a dreary and overlong soap-opera that feels like Dark Shadows without half the wit or character-interest. In addition, Daniel Waters juggles so many different subplots here and characters, that all maintain the depth of the shallow end of the swimming pool, that it's easy to get lost in the shuffle of ""Dhampirs"" and ""Morois"" and other such trivial nonsense.Then there's the fact that the film is just not funny to boot. There's nothing worse than a bad movie than a bad movie that is boring and not funny. Vampire Academy runs for only one-hundred and four minutes which, when watching a fantastic film like Inside Llewyn Davis races past, feels like twice that length in this case. Dialog just exists, not really to spark a laugh or make the audience think, but similar to the dialog on loathsome daytime soap operas where it simply exists to exist.One trend I'm tiring of with Hollywood and it's manufactured teen films, giving us what they assume we like rather than what we want is that for every great film we get that deals with teens (The First Time, Mean Girls, or Pitch Perfect to name a few) and growing up and fitting in, we must endure several lackluster ones, many of which trying to assemble new franchises with the worst possible products bearing the worst marketing campaigns (The Host and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones) come to mind.Vampire Academy was directed by writer Daniel Waters' brother Mark, who's career has been an up-and-down affair with directorial projects like Freaky Friday and Mr. Popper's Penguins popping up in there alongside the ingenuous and honest film Mean Girls, that every teenage girl in suburbia seems to treasure. Even those can quote Mean Girls like a Christian can quote Bible verses wouldn't bat their eyelashes at Vampire Academy, and for once, I don't plan on calling out their opposition or their ignorance.Starring: Zoey Deutch, Lucy Fry, and Dimitri Kozlovsky.

9,Buddy-51,Pathetic mishmash of much better sources,3,13 August 2014,"Nestled in the wilderness of rural Montana, St. Vladimir's is like a Hogwarts Academy for fledgling bloodsuckers. The main vampire-in- training is Lissa (Lucy Fry), who, after a number of years living on the ""outside,"" is back at school to finish up her education. She's accompanied by Rose (Zoey Deutch), a sassy, feisty human who serves as Lissa's 24/7 ""guardian"" and with whom she shares a psychic connection.While St. Vladimir's curriculum may run to such unconventional subjects as magic, compulsion, martial arts and Romanian history, the school itself plays host to all the cliques, backbiting and teenage hanky panky that exist in even the least supernatural of high schools.There are ""good"" vampires and ""bad"" vampires and all sorts of in-between vampires, but ""The Vampire Academy,"" which is based on a 2007 novel by Richelle Mead, is just a pale imitation of ""Twilight"" and ""The Vampire Diaries."" What's different is the flippant, sarcastic tone that's supposed to make it hipper and more self-aware than those straighter takes on the subject. But the effort falls flat simply because kitsch that doesn't take itself seriously is always far worse than kitsch that does, mainly because it demonstrates a lack of respect for its fan base. All this is true of ""Vampire Academy,"" despite the best efforts of Deutch and ""Modern Family""'s Sarah Hyland, who plays the nerdy chatterbox of the undead set. Somehow, top-tier actor Gabriel Byrne has also wandered - inadvertently, one presumes - onto the set, but even a performer of his caliber can't manage to breathe life into this toothless take on the already over-saturated teen-vampire genre.Though the movie wraps things up with a tidy moral message at the end, there's the ominous suggestion that there may indeed be a sequel in the offing (there are many more books in the series from which to cull further material, which already doesn't look promising). Let's hope someone drives a stake through this particular movie's heart before it rises from its coffin to do any further damage.",Vampire Academy
10,cricketbat,"Tries to be cool, but falls flat on its face",2,31 December 2018,"Vampire Academy is impressive the way it over-explains everything, yet says nothing of substance. This movie tries so hard to prove that it's cooler than the movies it's ripping off, but it's constantly tripping over its own feet and falling flat on its fangs. From the melodramatic acting to the paper-thin plot to the cheesy special effects, this movie is one big misfire.",Vampire Academy
11,A_Different_Drummer,One of the most serious pacing problems ever...,7,29 April 2014,"... which ironically makes this film exceptionally difficult to review.Notes: 1. Needless to say, this reviewer is not of the demographic of this very ambitious (some might perhaps use the word ""arrogant"") film. Ordinarily this would be a handicap. However based on the reaction from the intended demographic in the chat groups, which borders on outright hatred, this may actually give me more objectivity.2. Running almost 2 hours with the last minute or so devoted to advertising the sequel (a nasty habit that is now part of Hollywood's DNA, with antecedents back to the 1930 cliff-hangers) this was intended to be the first in a series. Whether that will ever happen is now in doubt...?3. Some of the most astounding pacing problems I have ever seen in a film, especially given the obvious availability of talent and budget. I mean, you have names like Joely Richardson and Gabriel Byrne just sitting around .. and this is the best you can do? The film does not even start to resemble a proper film (with rhythm and pacing and audience connection) until about 1 hour in, AND THAT IS MUCH TOO LATE.4. Another irony -- the ""teen themes"" about romance and BFFs and the perils of zits and high school seem overly forced, and therefore less likely to impress the intended audience. Which seems to be what actually happened.5. The one redeeming factor is Zoey Deutch,a newcomer who appears to have been unleashed by the director and simply allowed free rein to do her thing. The only wise decision he made, it seems. This girl has major potential, the camera loves her, I believe the audience connected with her, and overall she comes across as a sassy Ellen Page -- and, recall, Page was pretty darned sassy to start with. Best of luck in her future career.",Vampire Academy
12,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,7 May 2014,"Vampire AcademyThe weirdest thing about an academy for vampires is that the school's team mascot is a hemophiliac.Unfortunately, this romantic-fantasy doesn't feature any sports.Following her parents' tragic death, the vampire princess Lissa (Lucy Fry) and her smart- alecky protector Rose (Zoey Deutch) runaway from the academy and live among humans for two years.Suddenly hunted by a legendary race of vampires, the girls are forced to return to St. Vladimir's Academy, where Lissa's latent powers begin to flourish.But those powers prove desirable to a secret cabal intent on harnessing them.Elsewhere, an instructor (Danila Kozlovsky) teaches the impetuous Rose the fighting skills she will need to fend off an imminent onslaught of vicious vamps.With vapid romances, infantile dialogue, and grating performances, this adaptation of the Teen Lit book series is a bubble-gum depiction of a once formidable species.Besides, how can teenage vampires suck blood with braces on?

13,tomgillespie2002,Like bad fan-fiction written by a teenager,2,7 July 2016,"Mark Waters' Vampire Academy, based on the hugely successful series of young-adult novels by author Richelle Mead, spends so much of its 100-plus minute running time trying to explain itself and attempting to conjure the same level of mass hysteria that surrounded the likes of the Twilight and Harry Potter books, that it isolates nigh-on everybody apart from those already completely in love with the source material. It's an uncomfortable hybrid of the aforementioned Twilight (sexy vampires!) and Harry Potter (a secret school for magical types!), yet makes Stephanie Meyer and J.K. Rowling's work seem like Dostoyevsky in comparison.Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry) have run away from St. Vladimir's Academy, trying desperately to live like real humans do. Rose is a Dhampir, a half-vampire, half-human hybrid who has dedicated her life to protecting Lissa, a royal Moroi (peace-loving vampire), and the two share a psychic connection which allows Rose to occasional eavesdrop on Lissa. A year after fleeing the school, they are re-captured by 'dreamy' Russian Dhampir Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky), who whisks them both back into the care of headmistress Kirova (Olga Kurylenko), but not before battling off some red-eyed Strigoi (evil vampire). Once back, Lissa is the victim of a series of attacks, including dead animals being left for her to find, and threats scrawled on her wall written in blood.It's the slightest of plots, yet Vampire Academy still somehow manages to feel over-stuffed. While Rose struggles to explain the entire universe as well as several characters' back-stories via her own brand of sarcastic narration ripped shamelessly from Juno (2007), there's little time to catch up with what is actually going on and no time at all to care. Even for a film that feels like it was based on a teenagers' work of clumsily sculpted fan-fiction (although I haven't read the book), the complete absence of wit and social observation comes as a shock given the film boasts the talents of Daniel Waters, who wrote the wonderfully dark Heathers (1988), and his brother Mark, director of the surprisingly hilarious Mean Girls (2004). Any plans for a franchise were quickly and thankfully scrapped when the film bombed upon release, and it's not difficult to see why. The whole experience is stilted and awkward, and Deutch is unbearably annoying throughout.",Vampire Academy
14,Thanos_Alfie,Not good...,3,18 March 2020,"""Vampire Academy"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a girl who is Dhampir (half human-half vampire) trying to protect the Moroi (mortal vampires) from the Strigoi (immortal Vampires). The Moroi are living within our world in a peaceful way and they don't make their presence notable.Since I didn't have high hopes or expectations from this movie I wasn't disappointed by it. I didn't like this movie because it has a very boring plot with many filler scenes that make it even more boring. The direction which was made by Mark Waters lacks action. About the interpretations of the cast I don't have to mention any since everyone made poor interpretations. I have to mention here that I haven't read the book but I am definitely sure that the book would be far better than this movie so, if you have already read the book I advise you not to watch this movie. As it can be easily understood I don't recommend anyone watching this movie because you will lose your time and there are far better movies with vampires to watch.",Vampire Academy
15,pennyelenabooks,not good enough,3,17 January 2016,"It's been a while since I've read the books, but I don't think that it would have changed my rating if i haven't read them. I was afraid that the whole vampire mythology would have been confusing and the main problem of the film, but it was explained smoothly and I believe that even the ones who hadn't read the book wouldn't have a problem following the story. Other than that, the movie was a teenage high school drama with some blood here and there but not any actual horror scenes, which, in my opinion, would have improved the movie. Then there was the pace. The movie wanted to include everything from the book, which resulted to lighting speed action, as one sequence followed the next so immaturely that it didn't allow the mystery to develop. The performances were okay, at least, even though Dimitri was a little awkward. The vampires didn't look fake, as well, which was a relief. But I don't think I would watch the movie again, and I was surprised that the ending suggested a second movie.",Vampire Academy
16,leonblackwood,CSI for Vampires! 4/10,4,10 August 2014,"Review: Personally, I wasn't that impressed with this movie. It reminded me of a CSI for Vampires because there is a lot of investigating and not that much action until the end, when the plot unfolds. The main character reminded me of Juno, who just doesn't stop talking and makes a joke out of everything, but she did add some humour to the movie. I wasn't that impressed with the CGI and the storyline does get confusing in some parts, but it's a watchable film, even if your not into vampire movies. The concept was quite good, which does make me think about reading the book, but I personally think that the Twilight franchise has taken over this genre. Watchable!Round-Up: I haven't really seen any of the actors in this movie, before except for Gabriel Byrne who is famously known for The Usual Suspects. Zoey Deutch, who plays the main character, also starred in Beautiful Creatures, which was another mystical type of role and judging by the ending of this film, I'm sure that were going to see her in the sequel. All of the other characters wasn't that outstanding but I blame that on the material. At the end of the day, it's what it says on the tin, which is why it didn't blow up at the box office.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $15millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there vampire movies about a girl whose about to take over the vampire academy if she can surpass the evil doers. 4/10",Vampire Academy
17,tadpole-596-918256,This movie fails to lower itself to its target audience . . .,8,20 February 2014,". . . which is about the biggest mistake Hollywood can make, box-office-wise. Combining the magic of Hogwarts with the snark of JUNO, this flick rises far above any of the five TWILIGHT films or what will hopefully be the only IMMORTAL INSTRUMENTS movie with its way more logical vampire world view. Though a second-string cast is left to execute this far superior plot, it's important to remember JUNO was not born with ""A-listers,"" it MADE cast members (as well as its writer) stars. The special effects of VAMPIRE ACADEMY are passable, and the humor is better. It's hard to watch zombie movies populated by characters who apparently live in a media vacuum, at least pretending a total ignorance of zombie basics; ditto for vampire films, or any other supernatural niche story, given the pervasiveness of today's media. Fortunately, VAMPIRE ACADEMY is deftly set in a world of vampire awareness, even following J.K. Rawlings' lead in borrowing MEN IN BLACK-style ""memory wipes"" for its human ""feeders"" (blood cows).",Vampire Academy
18,davispittman,Better than I expected,6,22 December 2015,"Yes it is true that vampire Academy was better than I expected, but that doesn't mean that it didn't have it's flaws. The characters in this movie in my opinion were very well portrayed by the actors and well written. I especially loved Sarah Hyland's performance in this film, strong and well done on her part. The special effects were pretty cool to see. The script and the dialogue wasn't exactly great, but it was alright. The problem I had with this movie was the pace, the pace in the beginning was very slow and it felt like it was dragging, but it eventually quickens up. The action sequences are pretty fun to watch and aren't too gory. The costume design is well done and sharp. The sex scenes, which there is only about two aren't too graphic and are very sensual and will shot. I did enjoy the budding romances is between certain characters, that was refreshing. I really loved the lead actress and her character, I thought that character was very well done for the film. This movie also has kind of a twist ending which I really loved, I always love a good twist ending! There is also a good bit of eye candy to enjoy, the main male actors aren't too bad to look at haha. Overall, it's pretty enjoyable, but flawed as well.

19,TdSmth5,Good movie for teens,7,9 August 2014,"A family is on a trip, there's a car accident and all but the teen girl and her friend die. Next, we are quickly introduced to the entire mythology. There are good vampires to which the family belonged and some of them are royalty. There are bad vampires out to kill them. Then there are half vampires/humans called guardians whose mission in life is to protect the good vampires and kill the bad ones. Lissa, the survivor of the crash is a good and royal princess vampire. Rose, her friend, is her guardian. They are living out there in the real world for reasons explained later, and are in constant danger of being attacked by the bad ones. One night they are attacked, but it's more guardians who take them back to where they belong- Vlad's Vampire Academy. They are attacked on the way there by bad vampires.Turns out the VA is no different than a human high school with cliques/classes, and all sorts of drama. Lissa is immediately bullied by others and Rose ridiculed. Rose also has occasionally the ability to see/live what Lissa is going through. They think that some girl named Mia and her clique are behind the bullying. We also meet the schools administration and the vampire queen, as well as the top guardian. Lissa and Rose will have to discover who's after them and why and eventually confront them.Vampire Academy is a good teen movie. It has a lot of story and Zoey Deutch's Rose who is the narrator reads her lines awfully fast. But she also completely steals the show and she's gorgeous on top of that (that hair!). Gabriel Byrne, Sarah Hyland, Claire Foy give very strong performances. Danila Kozlovsky is a revelation here. Olga Kurylenko and Joely Richardson are a bit over the top/play it for laughs. And that's one weakness of the movie, its mixture of comedy, drama, action, horror is a bit awkward and it doesn't succeed entirely at any of those. The males in this movie don't serve a whole lot of purpose as is standard for Hollywood these days, and I assume teen books as well. As is also standard for vampire movies, they all have to have dysmorphic bony chiseled faces. Stunts and effects aren't very good but considering that this movie has a budget 1/100th the size of a moronic Michael Bay movie, no one should expect state of the art stuff. For the budget, they sure were able to make a lot of movie. And this movie has more story than most movies including their sequels. One interesting idea this movie features is that fans of the vampire genre offer their blood for food to the vampires- in small survivable doses. Overall, the second half of the movie works much better than the first.",Vampire Academy
20,khanbaliq2,A fast-paced and humorous supernatural romance that works.,6,13 February 2014,"After more than a month of movies that aren't worth seeing I finally had a good time at my local movie theater. Vampire Academy is the first good film of 2014. I, Frankenstein is entertaining fantasy action, but in terms of some quality it's Vampire Academy that's really worth seeing. There's a good cast, there's humor, there's a story that keeps one interested, and there's some action. At first there's some confusion about what's going on. It's because there are different vampires in addition to a setting that needs some description. After that, however, the film keeps entertaining until the end. There are several interesting characters. Zoey Deutch, playing Rosemarie Hathaway, is in the center of things. She's a feisty guardian but a loyal friend. Lucy Fry, playing Vasilisa Dragomir, is perfect as the girl with the royal blood. There's a growing love affair between her and Christian Ozera (Dominic Sherwood), but the more intriguing romance is the one between Rosemarie and Dimitri Belikov (Danila Kozlovsky). Friendship and romance aren't the central themes here though. The dangerous hierarchy of St. Vladimir's Academy is what Rosemarie and Vasilisa have to deal with. It's a good look at the struggles to gain social status in high school. The girls are tough but they still have to survive. This film adaptation of Richelle Mead's best-selling novel is definitely more interesting than Twilight (2008). Deutch had a part in Beautiful Creatures (2013), a film that I also liked. If you haven't seen Beautiful Creatures then see it. I recommend Vampire Academy too.",Vampire Academy

The faintest bit of optimism that the film might actually be something that Ender's Game and Beautiful Creatures was not. I knew nothing of the books. Seven in total I am told from my vampire novel-loving partner. But surely it a major studio release couldn't be as bad as the Twilight films. Surely just out of blind luck, a vampire film targeting the tweens might actually be watchable.Nope.Vampire Academy not only fails to exploit my flicker of faith but it pulverizes any rational reason as to why the screenplay was greenlit in the first place. A monstrosity of a mess, Vampire Academy is a clear front runner for worst film of 2014.I could attempt to educate you on the script, but I am not quite sure I understood it all myself. In the first five minutes alone we see a car crash, get introduced to a vampire and her half-vampire/half-human guardian, force fed the supernatural bond between the two, learn that vampires can control the four elements and are given a description as to dhampirs, Morois and Strigoi's. Whew.Zoey Deutch (looking very much like a young Rose Byrne) plays Rose Hathaway. She is a dhampir who is protecting Princess Vasilisa Dragomir (Lucy Fry) from Stigoi – an evil vampire breed created when a vampire takes a human life. Maybe more evil still are Vasilisa's classmates at the Vampire Academy who resent her return after being in the real world for the past year. It's like Mean Girls with fangs.There is some sort of plot. Vasilisa is tormented by someone or someones in her school who sacrifice wolves and cats in an attempt to gather her attention. Vasilisa seems less concerned about those trying to kill her than she is about the boys in her school and her desire for acceptance. That brings a few Robert Pattinson look-a-likes into play that add nothing much else to the story than doing just enough to get us to the next DVD chapter without displaying any real character. There is also a love interest for Rose, large wolf dogs, more vampire mythology and Gabriel Byrne trying his best to ensure that he is not overlooked by next year's Razzie nominations.The screenplay by Daniel Waters is the film's largest obstacle. The dialogue is Aaron Sorkin fast but written with a Uwe Boll sense of direction. Characters talk quickly to each other and then the scene will just cut as if we came to the end of a chapter and the director didn't know how to transition to the next scene with any sense of flow.Those holding out for strong action scenes to be the glue that holds you between naps can forget about it. Poorly choreographed and uninspiring hijinks are the norm as the film stumbles towards a final shot that suggests a sequel (it will not happen).Vampire Academy might have worked as a television series. Why not. Dirty Little Liars Meets True Blood on CW. But this mess is easily the worst film of the year. At least until the next Adam Sandler film is released.",Vampire Academy
22,FilmMan47,Where Is Kate Bekinsale When You Need Her,3,3 May 2014,"few years ago the twilight franchise came and the whole world went nuts some hated it some liked it on the other hand i liked them for what they are never read the books but the films were decent adaptations and contained some good acting specially in breaking dawn part 1 & 2 by Kristen Stewart the concept is not new we all remember underworld series & recently Aaron Ekhart;s I Frankenistine this film is based on the vampire academy book series by Richelle Mead.the plot:the half human and half vampire Rose Hathaway is training to be a guardian at St Vladamir;s academy along with other students when the academy comes under attack from outside vampires she must save Lissa Dragomir along with other members.there is a lot of sexual & romantic themes in the books the makers did try to include some of it here also these vampires have other powers as well like all elements including fire,water,air etc it looked like a x-men movie more then a vampire one, the cast is totally passable yes there are some hot girls doing same lame comedy & smooching boys Zoye Deutch & Lycy Fry look good but Olga Kurylenko was a surprise to see shes a scene stealer.people are still into these types of films i did like some funny situations in the film other then that its repeating same stuff we have seen before thousand times now where is Kate Bekinsale when you need her she would kill all the bad guys.overall vampire academy 2014 is a below average attempt by the makers it could have been better my rating is 3/10.skipp it",Vampire Academy
23,brookenichole-98054,At least it's entertaining,4,19 October 2020,"Vampire Academy is far from great. It suffers with its fast pace, confusing topics, bad characters, and a terrible script. The story itself isn't so awful but the characters just don't make it fun.
The main love interest, Dimitri, was so bad. His acting was flat. I could clearly see the other actors/actresses trying their hardest, though.
The music selection for this movie was terrible and did not fit the movie at all. However, I will say that the directing and fight scenes were great.
At least it's entertaining.",Vampire Academy
24,abisio,Harry Potter for girls ?,3,28 April 2014,"After reading Harry Potter's series very adult (after the second movie) I rediscover a kind of literature I had stopped paying attention (Julius Verne, Salgary, Defoe and many other classic authors can be considered Young Adult authors too).However a title like Vampire Academy was not tempting enough; but when the movie came I give it a try.To my disappointment, this is basically part Potter's rip off ( Vampires with magic powers in a high school ), part Disney (royalty and unexplained commitment to protect them without any clear logic ). The fact that the main characters were young women, could be too sexual for USA's sense of morality so that element is nearly out. Also, because it is PG-13 action and violence are not particularly interesting either (aside for a couple of very brief scenes). At the end, these Royal Vampires are only interested in fashion, fame and fighting for the strongest guy (which is usually the most stupid). Do you see any cliché here ?.So, at the end, the only interesting thing was humor and I have to give that there are a few moments when this absurd thing became funny.Rose Hathaway (the great Zoey Deutch ), the only really developed character in the full movie; is a Vampire bodyguard, spend most of the movie talking to herself and conducting the story. The resource gets repetitive but never reach the limit of became boring.Sadly, the lack of the imagination is so big, that we know the villain as soon as an old known actor not aged gracefully appears on the screen.I did not read the book (but it seems its the first one, it has not really been altered too much and it is the weakest of the trilogy), but I hope Mrs. Deutch get another opportunity to show her acting skills.",Vampire Academy
25,silvermistvio,A bit different from any other Vampire stories.,4,14 May 2019,"Most of the reviews are saying how much this film is bad. And also they are complaining that this film is terrible. As for me, I don't think this film is either good or bad. It makes me difficult to write review on this one because I also don't know how to judge.Basically, this film is about vampires. But it's more than Vampire. It indeed has extra things. So, sometimes, it makes me really confused. I must admit that this film really bad in some conditions. And sometimes, it's totally nonsense. But it's not that terrible. At least, I still can watch it.There's only one thing I don't like. They shouldn't write anything that ridicule the other Vampire stories such as Twilight. I think this film will be better if there is no such part in it.Because of the rating on this film, they don't even do a sequel. And this film doesn't have an end. So, it seems like it's stranded. I kind of don't like it. I really don't care about ratings, I really want to see the ending. No matter how much it is bad, if only there's an end, it's better.All in all, compared to other Vampire films, this film is nothing. That being said, it doesn't mean this film is unwatchable. At least it doesn't make me boring, well, I think it's at the normal.",Vampire Academy

Great production, sloppy story. Why does it need a sequel? Why is the movie named after the derogatory term? Just another new teen vampire movie with aspirations of franchising, and getting a big slice of the big money pie. If you are a teen you will most likely Enjoy this, and if you are a teen inside then you might get the same little thrills, though anyone looking for a real deep story should look on another page, or flip over to another shelf which ever. I can only recommend this movie at all because of the very high production value, and all of the serious effort that you can see on the screen. Not a world class movie, but it will entertain in a pinch.",Vampire Academy
27,billygoat1071,Vampiric World,4,3 March 2014,"Vampire Academy defines anything that a YA movie needs to please its target viewers. By concept, it's basically Harry Potter (a supernatural school) and Twilight (teenage vampires) merged together into one new mythology. Hormonally, it would have been annoying since the fascination of this genre keeps getting hindered by its terribly generic romantic subplots. But when you have Mark Waters, the director who usually shows the truths and satires in female high school life, you get an at least appealing environment. Unfortunately it has a hard time juggling with its subplots and developing its world. And that is where the film falls short like the others.The film deserves a credit for being a less unbearable disposable YA. It's a better movie when you let Rose jump into people, narrating her school life like a teen movie that has something to say with the modern social conduct. But the plot aims to the epic series elements more than the coming-of-age tale roots. The real problem is how unfocused the storyline is. The characters doesn't have much to do other than explaining stuff and waiting what happens next. It's momentum free and the threat is rarely existent until it finally snaps appear out of nowhere at the second half.The script seems to be more interested in the memes, and it's a missed opportunity because a little teen movie mockery would have been a perfect fit for a fantasy world that the genre provides, but the mythology building is underwhelming thus it feels like it's just another vapid teen comedy but with supernatural themes all over it. The pizazz is relied at the stars. Zoey Deutch is quite natural. She gives real energy that makes Rose a competent lead hero. Lucy Fry also gives some personality to her role, even if the character is not fleshed out enough. The rest seems to be having fun and that's a good thing to see.Vampire Academy might have worked better as a TV series (label it as part comedy so no confusion with the ""Diaries"" show.) I mean there's a lot of things to develop. All we apparently get is attitude scattered into a random world of educational vampires. If I can be honest, the material has potential, the characters and the setting can be worth rooting for, but really, the storytelling lack consistency and intrigue. Maybe next time they would get it right (or not).",Vampire Academy
28,DareDevilKid,"Though Not Scary, Still A Refreshing Vampire Yarn After Ages",7,1 May 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsWell...well....well.....didn't expect this to turn out so fine! One of the most pleasant cinematic surprise ever. What shaped out to be another inane, run-of-the-mill vampire schtick that Hollywood so frequently churns out these days in the wake of the ""Twilight"" films, was actually a highly enjoyable tale with a delightfully revamped twist to the vampire saga. Heck, it even had a few ""Twilight"" puns thrown in for good measure.In hindsight, ""Vampire Academy"" is more along the lines of a ""Harry Potter"" scenario, with vampires replacing the witches and wizards in a wholly magical world, where young vampires are segregated into factions based on their innate abilities and trained in a clandestine institution coexisting within the real world. Though I haven't read the book it's based on, I have heard only positive feedback from many of the novel series' loyal fans. Mark Waters' direction is assured and crisp, drawing the viewers in and gradually allowing them to embrace the unfolding drama and fantasy. The relatively unknown cast displays good on-screen presence and I guess that Waters again deserves credit for this. In the midst, we also have a veteran like Gabriel Byrne shining all the way through.Copious amount of fantasy, exciting action, an intriguing plot, palpable mystery, and sharp narrative twists characterize ""Vampire Academy"", making it feel like a breath of fresh air in our plagued recent times of deplorable vampire films. It's a pity that in all probability it won't be getting a sequel since it wasn't a box-office smash, which is a real shame given that audiences lapped up five deplorable ""Twilight"" films.",Vampire Academy
29,nikola17,i thought i was going to hate movie but i didn't,8,12 April 2014,"The movie was actually really amazing It stayed true to the book, only changing a few minor things or adding a few things. The actress who plays as Rose was 18 while filming, only a year older than Rose. Yeah, Dimitri was a little too old, but the actor playing him was 27 at the time, only 3 years older. The girl playing Lissa is little too old, but it didn't really bother me all that much. And Rose does have a silver stake, but the writer said he wanted to make things a little more interesting and decided to give her a stake in the first movie. It actually made it a little better to see that the guardians are training their novices with stakes earlier. Overall, I found everything to just be so awesome and amazing. The trailers did NOT do justice.﻿ i was thinking this is girl version of Blade but it wasn't it, it was different movie not like Twilight crap expected the actors can act better (Zoey Deutch)she was pretty, likable character, funny,better then Kristen Stewart part i really like with Rose and Dimitri having romantic time gets close with Dimitri i like her fighting moves when she kills the vampires that was awesome kinda like blade she was Half Human Half Vampire kinda like Blade but in my opinion Blade was better. i never knew this movie was based on book ? sometimes when i look at new movies out in cinemas, later on you find out it's based on Book or Original Film this film got Hated got %10 At Rotten Tomatoes but i don't listen to the haters this movie come out in Australia March 6 i watched this movie when it almost ended because new movies comes out it push's all the way the last in list i don't like harry potter but this more violet action movie then Harry Potter but only thing is i know someone told me The movie bombed pretty bad at the box office (which sucks) and no one is sure what's gonna happen :/ The people who started the movie have hinted around at a Kickstarter, but nothing else has really been said. the advertising was just wrong, so I think if the posters would have been better and the trailers too, the movie could have done so much better. When fans saw the poster with the tagline ""they suck at school"" slapped on the front, they hated it and some refused to see the movie, especially after the first couple trailers. Lots of fans and non fans didn't want to see the movie, thinking it was going to be some huge disappointment. In reality, it was REALLY close to the book and nothing like what the posters and trailers said it would be. So, yeah, if the posters/trailers would have been different, it would have made a HUGE difference, in my opinion.﻿ i liked this movie good action scenes with Rose Hathaway fighting with Natalie good Showdown but i wish it could done it better because when they kill the vampires they don't really burn into flames i don't get that that what i wanted to be fixed. the werewolf's needs to be with not CGI but the wolfs don't do much in movie i like the sliver stake what rose use's witch is good i liked Dimitri the character witch was but it's true he was a bit old but didn't bother me as much i thought he wasn't bad ass as much as rose for me Dimitri didn't do much for me i thought he was good not great mostly this movie was good i didn't care for haters i never listen to the haters this is noting like twilight or everything like that but it is not real real vampire it is real but not really that much the vampires are more of guardians of the Moroi, peaceful, mortal vampires immortal vampires what ever they are but this movie was Amazing 10.10 not really for me i give it 8.10 believe me this not romantic twilight movie it is more of Action Comedy Fantasy movie but i like new actor Zoey Deutch She was amazing one of my favorite girl actress",Vampire Academy
30,shawneofthedead,"This won't go to the top of the class, but it's not a complete failure either.",6,26 February 2014,"In a world sparkled into submission by the Twilight phenomenon, it's hard to take yet another vampire high-school fantasy seriously. That could be one reason why the movie version of Vampire Academy - based on a best-selling series of novels by Richelle Mead - has been met with such overwhelming critical derision. Critics have blasted the film for being lazy, riddled with clichés, and overstuffed - only the last of which is strictly true. Actually, Mark Waters' film is a fun watch, featuring offbeat characters and relationships so interesting that you might find yourself wanting them to have more screen-time, not less.Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) is a Dhampir: a half-human/half-vampire girl born to be a Guardian to the Moroi - a race of peaceful, magical and mortal vampires. Rose shares a psychic bond with her best friend Lissa (Lucy Fry), a Moroi princess who's the last of her particular bloodline. Rose's task is to protect Lissa from the Strigoi: immortal, blood-hungry vampires with neither soul nor depth of feeling. But the Strigoi have nothing on the vagaries of high school: Rose and Lissa must deal with nasty pranks and clique politics, even as the conspiracy against Lissa gains a strength that suggests it might go deeper than anyone suspects.Amidst the rush and rage of high school, we'll meet Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky), Dhampir extraordinaire; Natalie (Sarah Hyland), the geeky daughter of Victor (Gabriel Byrne), a friend of Lissa's family; and Christian (Dominic Sherwood), a brooding young man whose Moroi parents chose to turn themselves into Strigoi by taking innocent lives. Not to mention Mia (Sami Gayle), the catty girl who has it out for Lisa and the film's biggest 'stars': Olga Kurylenko as batty headmistress Kirova and Joely Richardson as Moroi queen Tatiana.If that sounds like a surfeit of story, you haven't even heard the half of it. Vampire Academy is jam-packed with details, exposition and characters, all of them jostling for attention. There are complex rules and taboos surrounding the entire society, most of which are either shoe-horned awkwardly into dialogue or tossed quickly into the story as it tumbles by at a breathless pace. The characters' quips and depth get a little lost in the tumult. It's really what keeps the film from finding its feet: the ideas crammed into Mead's universe simply aren't given much room to breathe.Stick with the film, however, and it evens out into a fun - if rather frustrating - viewing experience. There's a welcome cheeky bite (pun very much intended) to the script, which somewhat makes up for the unsettling choppiness of the story. Rose, too, makes for a spunky protagonist who's several worlds away from Twilight's tragically unprogressive heroine, Bella. She kicks butt, loses her temper, and reels off sarcastic zingers - all while demonstrating that she's every bit as capable as Dimitri and the guys around her. The element of romance that's an inevitable part of every high-school film doesn't grate as much as it might: the final moment between Rose and Dimitri is a heartfelt, surprising delight, and one of the most refreshing scenes you're ever likely to see in a teen movie.The cast is mostly competent, with Deutch the clear stand-out. Carrying the entire, occasionally unwieldy film on her shoulders, she's hugely likable and natural on screen. Her compatriots fare less well, with Fry in particular feeling rather awkward and hamstrung in her part. Hyland, meanwhile, has quite a bit of fun subverting any expectations audiences might have of her based on her sassy airhead role in Modern Family. Byrne plays it straight, if a little tortured, while Kurylenko and Richardson seem to have wandered in from a high-camp pantomime.Vampire Academy is very far from high art: it's too messily stitched together for that, bursting at the seams from a slightly nonsensical plot that often threatens to overwhelm the characters and their relationships. But it's also quite far from the travesty that most critics have suggested it is. There's something smarter and more enjoyable at work here, even if it sometimes gets buried beneath the machinations of its own script.",Vampire Academy

One of the latest attempts of robbing the 'Young Adults' of their allowance and getting them to return for endless (two part) sequels is Vampire Academy. Let me first say I'm so glad it failed horribly at the box-office so we never have to see another of these films again. It's based on books but it still doesn't have an interesting story worth repeating here, it's all plain nonsense. The 'Academy' here is just Hogwarts. I'm sure they just brought the Harry Potter sets back out of storage without even a repaint job. And the vampire part - well, that's where they try to rip off Twilight and fail (and Twilight wasn't even good). I mean c'mon, everybody must be so sick of vampires by now. Unless you have some incredibly cool angle (cfr True Blood) then don't even bother. And apparently the kids aren't as dumb as the Hollywood suits think coz they sent a clear message by not turning up to see this crap (VA only made 15m$ worldwide).

Though the fight sequences are entertaining enough, while unconvincingly choreographed, they are too few and far between to prevent this feeling like an appallingly sub-par highschool drama with none of the charm of Mean Girls before it; and as a fan of the mythology, I'm left to wonder if it's really Twilight that's done the most damage to vampires since the turn of the millennium after all.",Vampire Academy
35,Morbius_Fitzgerald,One of the most wretched movies of the year and considering my views on current movies THAT IS A NEW LOW!,1,20 August 2014,"Okay, I am a fan of vampire books (not the ones this film was based on but to its credit, it can't be worse than this) and movies. I went in with the mentality ""it can't be worse than Twilight"", no offense to fans of the books but...it very nearly is.I will start with my vote for the worst thing about the film. It fails to explain one thing about the new mythology of Vampires nor what this ""Vampire Academy"" is even really meant to be about. Okay, they try within the first 5 minutes of the film but let me just tell you what else they throw in and expect you to try and remember this;-2 fight scenes-A kidnapping storyline-A ""dual feeding"" storyline and why thats a bad thing-A telekinetic connection between the two leads explained over a plot pointYou are expected to remember all of this and follow the story when all that sh!t happens IN UNDER 5 MINUTES! If you want audiences to take your mythology seriously, SPEND TIME DEVELOPING IT! Even Twilight did this better. Okay, Twilight f!cked over the vampire mythos and everything about it but at least they spent time on it so the audience isn't thinking ""what the f#ck is going on?!"" I never thought I'd live to see the day when Vampire Academy becomes complicated.Okay, so the story is that a vampire princess and her wannabe guardian (for her character, think Kenzi from Lost Girl minus the humor and anything else that would make her enjoyable) are fighting off a threat to the Princesses life. And a majority of the film is ""they think its this one guy or girl but it isn't"". Also throw in 2 love relationships, an ""outcast nerd"" subplot, a vampire dying of...vampire degenerative disease and a plot point about the Princess trying to climb up the popularity ladder again. Is it just the theme for modern Hollywood to just throw in a ton of plot and just hope it all holds weight? First The Amazing Spiderman 2, now this. And for those that think because I think its complicated I don't get it, watch The Man Who Fell To Earth, Don't Look Now, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Fata Morgana and Wings Of Desire. All of these films I consider confusing at least at one point or another but I like them.Now okay, if the plot isn't worth it at least the characters can be right? Wrong! These leads are SO ANNOYING! Mostly what they do is try to get back at the worst written bully I've ever seen in a movie (no joke) and figure out ""do I like this boy?"" and, as I said earlier, trying to regain popularity. Um...hello? Threats have been made on your life! Why don't you use your title as Princess to, I don't know, BUILD A SECURITY SYSTEM FOR YOUR SCHOOL OF VAMPIRES SO YOU CAN FIND OUT WHOSE WRITING BLOOD MESSAGES ON YOUR BEDROOM WALL! Oh, I'm sorry for using my head. You go focus all your energy on regaining popularity while this psycho stalker kills your cat (no joke, thats in the movie) and hangs a bloody corpse above your front door...THINK!Oh and the characters try to throw in a moral at the end, because after reading THAT paragraph above you'd just LOVE that for your teenage girl. Its that popularity and bullying are meaningless...when I said this had worse writing than The Worst Witch did you really think I was kidding?When it comes to vampire films, I'm a fan, really. However the writing of this film makes The Worst Witch look like Lord Of The Rings. I mean a German vampire film I saw called We Are The Night was brilliant. It took its time for the mythology to set, the stupidity level of the main characters is only as far as ""not doing a good job of cleaning up blood"" and the characters were interesting. And I know most people are like ""oh I can't watch subtitled films"" well you can read can't you? So whats wrong with looking at a screen that has both action and text over it? And if you REALLY can't do that, go watch the English dub.Overall, this film is one of the worst films I've seen in a while. Its not because its a ""chick flick"" or something like that. But its because its a stupid movie with even dumber characters and even worse, it tries to throw in a moral. I've never read the books, all this film did was turn me off to an even greater extent.",Vampire Academy

The harder it tried to be funny, and the more irritatingly stupid dialog spewed out of these generic teenage character's mouths, the more obnoxious it got.While the gore is rather heavy by PG-13 standards, most the action scenes were still nothing to write home about.I found the movie to be a bit hard to follow. Not because the plot itself is confusing, but because the movie barely kept my attention. I didn't care about any of the characters, what was happening to them, or what was going to happen to them. I didn't care about Generic Hot Teenager #1's secret crush on her teacher, I didn't care about Token Annoying Side Girl, I didn't care about Generic Bad Boy Chick Magnet, and I definitely didn't care about Stereotypical B**** Character and Stereotypical B**** Head Mistress.Well, now that I've bashed the movie into the ground, I would like to say that I actually think that the VA series could have some potential to be good if, no, when they make it into a franchise. If they would lose the clique teen melodrama, and not skimp out on the gore. We'll see what happens.I think I'm being a little hard on this movie, I was actually going to give it a 4, but then I decided to lower my rating, hoping in vain that I would even out the scale a little bit.

This film would need a stake through its heart, if it had one.",1,7 February 2014,"No spoiler alert is necessary here because you can see what's coming about 14 miles off; it's a tiresome 100-minute mash-up of Underworld (which was pretty good), Harry Potter (which was somewhat better), Twilight (which was marginally better), and Mean Girls (which was awful, but not as awful as this movie). You know it's going to be bad when the opening credits list Harvey Weinstein, that Hollywood, ruling-class, plutocratic, anti-gun zealot, who's very comfortable with his own armed guards, but thinks us commoners should not be allowed to own firearms for self-defense. Oh the humanity! Pouting actresses with bee-stung lips and hunky actors with sinewy pecs spout quirky lines and moon after each other.

Vampire Acedmy was not great or even good. During the entire movie I had to ask ""what the heck is going on?"" The story was slapped together and what was even worse was the annoying English accented vampire you couldn't even understand. The one thing that should come out of this movie is a learning experience for other movie makers not to make the same mistake of a sloppy story and sloppy directing. Now directing is co existent with direction. One sentence with sum of what I feel about this movie the best. This movie had no direction.",Vampire Academy
43,madamemoviemonsterheart,Teenage Cousin And I Didn't Like It,1,20 March 2015,"My sixteen year old cousin didn't even like this movie. What hope did I have of liking it? I'm strictly going by the movie instead of the books since I haven't read them.1. The characters are annoying and pathetic. Rose sucks at being a Guardian, flirts with her teacher and never stays quiet. She is irritating and one of the worse female characters ever. The princess is just dull and not what you would want from a vampire. Why can't we have vampires that love tasting blood? It's what they do. Unless she's like Angel who has a soul or Blade whom is half human she should be relishing blood. The other characters are forgettable and bring nothing to the plot. Plus the bad guys daughter turns up to be evil was pretty obvious.2. Yes I did notice how this movie rips off Harry Potter which was very distracting honestly. Which didn't help the story or the plot holes. Why did the necklace not kill Rose but make her make-out with her teacher? (Even typing that question is making me gross out) Why do they decide to go to the dance instead of staying in their rooms since it's safer? Why do they have a jail right under the school? 3.Plus this movie has horrible pacing. Bullies play a dumb prank, student flirts with teacher (yuck) and The Princess tries to become more popular. Lather, rinse and repeat.This movie isn't as bad as Twilight but it still is bad. The vampires in this movie are still terrible, the high school is so clique that it makes me wish that I was watching Buffy or Harry Potter, this movie starts fast then it slows down at break neck speed in the middle of the movie with plot points that are unnecessary and I know I've mentioned this earlier but I really do hate Rose. She's a complainer, aggravating and honestly she's worthless. She can't do anything without someone giving her some help which is more strange since she's supposed to be a guardian.",Vampire Academy
44,da_flipboy,Let's look at the positives...,6,29 March 2014,"This is not a great movie, but it's certainly not bad. Here's some of the good that may have been overlooked...You immediately get the notion that there is a lot of information to relay to an audience that may not be familiar with the books (myself included), and the movie does a fine job of presenting said information in easily-digested pieces that even a guy like me can accept.The 2 teenage girl protagonist characters are refreshing examples of teenage girls with enough depth that you actually care about them. (I can thankfully report that they are far more role model worthy than ""Twilight's"" Bella character.) Rose, the rebellious fighter-type, kicks ass, has a quick wit, and bends the rules without being too unrealistic. By contrast, Lissa is the (literal) princess-type who is a reluctant heir, well-mannered, and amazingly vulnerable despite being powerful in her own way. These two characters create a fine base to build the movie around.The story itself unexpectedly turns into a mystery that, ultimately, is satisfying when all is said and done.The cast, on the whole, does an 'okay' job, but it's lack of strong, well-known, well-established actors may have hurt this movie's quality overall. The shining star in this movie is clearly Zoey Deutch who does a amazing job at believably and perfectly portraying a girl who can kick butt, crack wise, be an honorable protector, and still be a fallible teenage girl at the end of the day. I look forward to seeing more of her.This movie is far from perfect, but by the end of it, I didn't feel like punching someone in the face for it. (Which, I must be honest, is typical for this movie genre) I have seen thousands of movies and I know BAD movies. This is not one of them.In the end, ""Vampire Academy"", while only being above average, at least presents a unique vision into an over-saturated, over-visited intersection of teen fiction and fantasy. 6 out of 10.",Vampire Academy

In the first 5 minutes or so,you'll get an intro.Who are vampires,who are dhampirs,strigoi and so on.First acting is really,really bad.Almost all scenes felt so artificial.Dialogues are incredibly cheesy.Acting is bad.Just bad.Rose is a character that is a guardian for a vampire future princess.And they tried to portray like they have a strong bond.Her character was so shallow and honestly I was so not convinced.I think that girl was not the best choice.I won't start how bad the love scene with Dimitri was.The entire plot was laughable,so was acting,dialogues,twists if there were any at all.Honestly woudn't recommend this movie to a 5 year old.And yes I am pretty tired of all these movies that have 5 sequels or so.Maybe they should make this as a TV show.At the end you'll get to see a mass of strigois who are obviously planing an attack or something.Can we have for once an one part movie?I am tired of all these sequels.",Vampire Academy
46,ihatespike,An absolute pleasure!,10,17 February 2014,"I went to see this film unsure of what to expect, and I came out very happily surprised.This movie was a blast from start to finish, and a faithful adaptation of its source material. The actors were fresh and lively, the dialogue was witty and the plot moved along fluidly. Never once did I have to cringe at corny one- liners, awkward choreography, maudlin leading ladies or wooden love interests. The CGI wasn't overused, the kissing scenes didn't drag on, the fighting was thoroughly enjoyable and I easily grew to love the protagonist and supporting cast.If you have some trendy hatred towards vampire movies then you may not like this, if you don't like the books you won't, if you don't like teen movies you may not, but I myself loved it. It's the clean sensation of a whole other world opening up to me that draws me in to stories like this-often Young Adult fiction is reduced to the lowest common denominator and marketed that way, but when the formula is done right it's worth weeding through the ones that suck to find it. 10 stars!",Vampire Academy
47,dragonroars-57812,Finally a Movie that Sucks!,2,11 December 2015,"This movie is the Hogwarts of vampire movies but the author just steals from everyone in the process. During the narrative exposition at the beginning we get reminded how Twilight vampires sparkle in the sunlight. The only reason we need a narrative is the lack of a discovery character as in Harry Potter. In other movies we start with a normal human or someone who believes themselves to be ordinary and discover a hidden yet mystical world. No discovery, we are thrust into the vampire world and given a lengthy primer by the dhampire. A dhampire is a cross between vampire and human, like Blade, but in this movie even the vampires seem very ordinary.They spend a lot of the beginning of the film explaining how it all works. At some point you are asking, Are we there yet? The meat and potatoes of this movie is about teenagers, social issues at school, and popularity. Sounds very normal, too normal for a vampire picture. I am not expecting overt blood and gore in a PG-13 film, but there isn't much vampire action.Jokes are just pathetic and I really can't understand them poking fun at Anne Rice writing fan fiction for ""Twilight""? Anne Rice is one of the most notable authors of vampires, it doesn't make much sense to insult your target audience with lame jokes about her. If someone is reading this thinking they enjoyed watching this, watch it again and tell me what was so ""enjoyable""? The dialog may have been stolen from old episodes of ""90210"", the humor isn't funny, the love interest and drama is for after school specials, and they claim to be a school of vampires yet we see and hear no real instruction. The author is just tossing out another vampire wizard school for teens that sucks!",Vampire Academy

I watched the movie and i liked the use of koldunism magic. Also there is this new vampirism fiction.I was a little bit afraid because of the protagonists being teenage girls. And i was right. Instead of an action/horror film i saw a highschool drama with lots of bullying and at last pushing the idea that bullying is bad.There was nothing else. No actions scenes, no horror, no vampires as we know them...I finally got my hands on the first novel. I read it within two days. It kept me. I enjoyed it. And i came here to review this movie. Main protagonists are not even looking alike how the book describes them. The action in the book is far better described than what i saw. I can understand that when you adapting books you need to cut some things but seriously?I give it only 3 stars because Gabriel is delivering the role.

This movie is one that you're not supposed to take seriously, just the way the movie doesn't take itself. I was very surprised and amazed by Zoe Deutch, she was great and added an extra excitement to the movie. And even though the story was sometimes hard to understand because I haven't read the books and everything was half explained very quickly, it also it had a lot of clichés. It still was entertaining with its tongue- n-cheek dialogue, its characters and the pop culture references. And although it wasn't in the level of Mean Girls- because they share the same director- it still managed to look good but it had some issues with the editing and quality of some scenes. This movie wasn't near perfection, but it wasn't about that. Hopefully they'll make a sequel, because even though the endings wasn't as exciting to set the excitement or expectations. I still want to know more about the characters and just be around them, because they have that touch of fresh air and charisma that many other characters in other teenage movies lack. Just remember that you don't have to take it seriously and just go with it, because in the end it's all about having fun and enjoying.",Vampire Academy

There is no need to put unnecessary elements to tell a whatever story.

52,louisapedersen,Movie was okay,6,14 December 2020,"I have read the books, and read all the bad reviews about this movie before I watched it. Therefore I had NO expectations when I watched it, therefore I wasn't disappointed. Yes it wasn't close to as good as the amazing books, and the acting wasn't good. Although I know that some of these actors are brilliant in other things, which makes me think it's not really the actors fault for their poor acting, but rather the rushed scenes and writing of the scripts. Yes it was very rushed. In the book, each scene is so detailed and long, but here, each scene is very rushed. That's what happens when you make such a great book into a movie. If they made it into a tv series instead, I am sure they would have had more time to show everything, which means it would have been much better!

Still confused on if this movie was supposed to come off as campy or if it was supposed to be taken seriously... All the boys were ugly and looked the same. The headmistress was a young Catherine zeta Jones lookalike with horrible acting skills. The whole movie was cliché at best. At first I thought the blonde princess vampire girl was a horrible actress, but then I realized that she was a ""royal princess"" so her acting was OK in that ""stiff royalty"" sort of way, but honestly for the first 10 mins I was literally feeling like I had made a mistake paying money to see this movie, I was actually contemplating trying for a refund...

55,TyRawrrnosaurus,"'Vampire Academy' is Try Hard, Scooby-Doo Twilight Fan Fiction",3,7 February 2014,"Young adult adaptations have it rough in a world where we have Harry Potter and Twilight. The level of expectations range from super premium all the way down to toxic sludge. There is little in-between, with no saving grace for those who push out properties just because there's a large fan base behind the books. And as much as it may have seemed like a good idea, Vampire Academy (written by Richelle Mead) is yet another throwaway YA franchise that fails gloriously.Now I have never heard of the Vampire Academy series before the movie was announced, but apparently there are six of them. (Cha-ching!) Vampire Academy is the tale of Rosemarie ""Rose"" Hathaway (Zoey Deutch, who resembles a mix between Ellen Page and Linda Cardellini) and her BFF she has sworn to protect, Vasilisa ""Lissa"" Dragomir (Lucy Fry). These two ladies have been brought back to St. Vladimir's aka ""Vampire Academy"" in Montana after being on the run for a year. Lissa is the only living, rightful heir to the throne of Moroi (good vampires) through some regal upbringing that is given little explanation. They've been hiding out because Rose, a Dhampir (halfsie vampires who are the guardians of the Moroi) believes that Lissa has inherited some bad juju and is in danger.Of course shenanigans occur once they return to school. Blood warnings are smeared on the walls to frighten Lissa (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the truth to discover who's behind a mystery no one seems to care about has to be uncovered (Scooby-Doo), and the Strirgoi (evil vampires) want to kill the royal family because, you know, they're evil and such.There's awkward teenage love, high school melodrama, a big stereotypical speech about how we should all get along (Mean Girls), magic is used as a deus ex machina to push the story along, and random pop culture references that make little sense because we are told these kids aren't allowed off the premises of the academy and do not have Internet access or iPhones (#FirstWorldProblems). Sure Lissa and Rose escaped to Oregon for a year, but how did they find time to watch Pretty in Pink and Gladiator while they feared for their lives? I'd like to think that the director of Mean Girls, Mark Waters, would be a decent choice to attempt at breathing new life into the teenage vampire genre, but if you look at his filmography (Ghosts of Girlfriends Past; Mr. Popper's Penguins; The Spiderwick Chronicles) the guy is just a one-hit wonder who can't direct an action scene to save his life. Tina Fey should be the only one receiving kudos for Mean Girls thanks to her screenplay. Mark's brother and the screenwriter of Heathers, Daniel Waters, wrote this adaptation, and it becomes obvious where everything falls apart. (I really don't think Heathers is that great of a film either.) As I said, I have not touched one page of the Vampire Academy books, but I'm sure there has to be more depth to the characters than what is not articulated on screen. Fry does an OK job for her first feature, but Deutch will be the only one to walk away mostly unscathed with the potential for more work. Deutch will need to find a role that will challenge her range if she wants to stand out amongst Shailene Woodley and Jennifer Lawrence though. I dig her energy, quickness, and sass. She's like the male equivalent to Miles Teller. They also really force feed her cleavage as much as possible, which may not be an issue for some guys who get dragged to this by their girlfriends.All of the secondary characters: Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky) head Dhampir guardian, Christian (Dominic Sherwood) a fellow Moroi student, and Natalie (Sarah Hyland) also a Moroi, are carbon copies of roles we've seen before. Not a single character do you care about their outcome or come to understand their background throughout the movie. Olga Kurylenko, Gabriel Byrne, and Joely Richardson play the overseeing, party-pooper adult figureheads who bring some flavor with the cheesiest and most chewed up roles imaginable.The only redeeming quality that Vampire Academy has going for it is the dialogue; not because it's witty, funny, or sharp – it's far from it – but because it's miles away from the brooding vampire/fantasy we're use to. Sometimes Rose's banter with the others works because of Zoey's well-timed delivery, but the script feels like it is trying way too hard to be edgy and cool – as if it were Juno, which would have worked 10 years ago. The best part is that the film tries to rip on Twilight, but just ends up being nearly as shallow.If Daniel Waters spent a little more time fleshing out the rules and fun of the magic; going into more detail about the royal family and the school; expanded the mythology for us to understand the difference between the vampire races and their past; and provide some immediacy leading up to the climax than Vampire Academy could have worked. We're also stuck on this high school campus for who knows when because they don't give a hint as to how much time has past. Everything feels so closed off on this humungous campus while we are only taken to six or seven rooms.True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, The Twilight Saga, and Underworld, you would think someone would catch on that we've had a bit of an overload on the whole niche as of late, right? Vampire Academy in no way helps bring vampires back into the forefront of pop culture, it reinforces the fact that someone needs to drive a stake into the genre to put it to rest. Without the enthusiasm of the young cast Vampire Academy would have been insufferable. Take note Hollywood, it's not the quantity of young adult fiction-fantasy novels you bring us, it's the quality.",Vampire Academy

I have to admit that when I saw the pink high school cover of the movie, I didn't think I would ever watch it. But when I was bored out of my brains and I was looking for an airy, girlie movie, I found the trailer and it satisfied me enough to watch it. I must say that the story is quite cool, I haven't read the books and after watching this I actually want to read them. But I can understand that vampire or horror lovers find this a tacky 'another vampire movie' thing. It is predictable, girlie, the plot is bumpy and weird. Everything doesn't come together, the storyline only develops itself with more shocking revealings and predictable plot twists. But to be fair, if you are a teenage girl (or like me 21, and still in for teen movies some times) it can be amusing enough to watch.

I will continue to re-read the books because they are that awesome. However, I can't say that I would re-watch the movie inspired by the books, mainly because . . . well, it sucked.I feel like there were so many things wrong with this adaptation. Like, the majority - if not all - of the characters were miscast; the actresses who played Rose and Lissa were far from how I imagined them in the books, and they could've cast people who could actually embody these characters I love. The same goes for Christian - I like the actor as Jace in the Shadowhunters, but I don't think he was right person to play Christian. There were so many unintentionally funny parts, and they are, like, the only goods things about this movie. For me, they basically made it Mean Girls with vampires. And to be honest, I don't think it can be compared to Twilight; they have both have vampires, yes, but they are still completely different from each other. It really devastates me that I didn't like this movie. I really, really wanted to, but I really, really couldn't. A while ago, I remember seeing Julie Plec, who developed The Vampire Diaries into a TV show, and who created its spin-off, The Originals, tweet about making Vampire Academy, along with others, as a TV show. And to be honest, I would love that; not only do I feel like I can trust her, but I believe making Vampire Academy is a better idea; they did that with City of Bones, which was rebooted as a TV show called Shadowhunters - which I love - and Tomorrow, When the War Began, which was rebooted into a TV show, as well - though I loved the movie for that. So why not Vampire Academy?Anyway, this adaptation didn't work for me, and I hold out for Vampire Academy to get its second chance on-screen - with a completely different cast (I will come up with my own dream cast), script (and if there are any changes, they have to make sense), and, of course, developers (like Julie Plec).",Vampire Academy

I really enjoyed most of the acting. There were pretty spot on except for the actress playing Lissa. Lissa's personality got changed in the script and the movie made it seem like it was all about high school gossip and stuff like that. They didn't really concentrate on Rose and Lissa's deep relationship. And they skipped all the parts were we get to see the vulnerable side of Lissa and Rose. And I felt the movie was way to rushed. Like they just breezed through everything. The connection with Rose and Dimitri was pretty cute. , I felt giddy when they were together. But all in all i liked it.

If the film was well written, well acted, and a slight bit campy, it would be fine, but it just wasn't. The concept isn't original, the cast was all around shocking, excluding Victor, although there seemed to be a complete lack of evil-ferret-stroking; his character arc was rather predictable. Every single line was just exposition after exposition, with the occasional burst of teenage sass from Rose, which was extremely frustrating after a while. Quipping one liners is not necessary, especially after an hour and a half.Every relationship felt forced, I didn't feel any connection to the characters, and I honestly couldn't care less what happened to them; they were not believable in the slightest. A good script would have helped, but the performances also assisted in bogging it down I actually enjoyed the concept, as someone who hasn't read the books. I liked the vibe I got from the film to begin with, but it felt extremely tacky. Everything felt like plastic, everyone's face was constantly caked with makeup, felt extremely superficial and tacky, and every backdrop was injected with a tonne of poor CGI. All of the special effects through the film were just poor, and were not nice to look at. The fire effects looked like the fire effects from Adobe After Effects.I liked what they were trying, but they honestly needed to up their game all across the board; budget-wise, script-wise, casting-wise, and the dozens of other issues with this picture.

I never read the books, so i can't tell about comparisons. there are some parts that excite you, especially of you're a young adult, but the rest is boring dramas and stupid fighting scene with bad choreography. of course this movie is not the kind that I expect to be well acted, well directed with good pacing and storyline. so I have a very low expectation. and in more ways than not it is. it was bad acted, has bad cinematography, slow story pacing, and definitely not good directed. but, like i said, there some exciting part. the part that you just want to know a little bit more at the beginning, definitely disappointed in the middle, but then surprised that the ending isn't as bad as you think it would be.the best part is the black haired girl and the character played by the girl from modern family. they're probably the best assets in this movie. two characters who at least decently acted. i got it. they're funny and bad ass, and one girl could actually made me pity her. the romance is a big no, it disgust me and one big negative aspect of this movie. it's just to much, overly done. i would love the black haired girl, but she just became annoying and ooc half of the movie because of the romance. i know it's in the book, it's the main plot, it's a ya adult thing, so love story is an obligation but i just wish there's no romance at all. between them there's just no physical chemistry, no emotional chemistry, no good story background, nothing. the black haired girl at least has more physical chemistry with her blonde friend's boyfriend and not her Russian lover, who looked like he could be thirty. the blonde girl just is so annoying with that stupid accent,honey you could act a lot better than that, so are the two boys (even hot bodies can't save them).bottom line, it's bad, but it's 2,5/5 kind of bad for me.",Vampire Academy

What we got instead was Mean Girls with fangs.While most people seemed to blame the bad movie on the cast of (at the time) lesser known actors, I blame it entirely on the writers. Instead of actually delving into the books and writing a script that paid credence to Richelle Mead's writing, they gave us the same ""Plastic"" drivel that comes from any Waters Brothers movie.If this movie had been written and directed as it should have been, this would have been the beginning of a long lasting movie franchise. Instead we get this one movie flop and may never get the chance to see a ""proper"" adaptation on the big screen within our lifetime.",Vampire Academy
66,masandaglinus123,One of the worst YA book-to-film adaptation ever,1,1 April 2015,"Vampire Academy is one of the worst film released in 2014 and it's also one of the worst YA adaptation ever. Trying to mix the concept of Harry Potter, Twilight and Mean Girls, this YA film is a less satisfying to watch. Mark Waters, the director of Mean Girls, did a terrible job to direct this film. Daniel Waters, the screenwriter of Heathers, also did a terrible job writing the script. The script was awful and poorly written. It suffers from a horrible pacing, unfunny jokes, uninteresting fights, crappy romance and more and more cheesy dialogues. The casts were totally pathetic on their performances and I can't stand them on screen. For those people who have read the book will surely be disappointed and even those people who hadn't read the book will be disappointed too. I think it's time to destroy these YA book-to-film wannabees who try to make the success of other YA book-to-film adaptations like The Hunger Games. So, grow up Hollywood! I will give this film a score of 1 because I don't really see interesting in here except for the fact that the main lead looks like a young Rose Byrne.",Vampire Academy

What is this piece of trash movie, who funded paying for it, and how did they get such a god actor like Zoey Deutch to BE IN THIS MOVIE. WOW, let me preface by saying I really do enjoy movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt. But watching this movie took every ounce of my will to live. The actors are horrible, the plot is as stupid as it can get, and you literally HOPE more of the main characters die because god knows it would make this movie a little more interesting. ANYTHING, if ANYTHING could redeem this movie, it would be Zoey Deutch's character because at least she has some inkling of a personality, her quips are sharp, and she's got moves.

68,FamousGirlfriend,"Only decent thing I've seen in it's genre since Buffy, give it a sequel",8,14 May 2014,"OK, I'm going to keep myself short: I'm not really the target audience for a film like this, I'm too old, and I really, really dislike vampire movies and pretty much all of the mind numbing teenage flicks of late. I just watched this because of Zooey Deutch, since I liked her performance in Ringer.AND I LIKED IT SO MUCH I VOTED 9 OUT OF 10. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I was even more surprised that I actually went and got the books and read them all in 2 days.In it's genre (teenagers+vampires+romance+high school) this was the only good thing I've ever experienced (except Buffy, which I love). It joked playfully with it the genre itself, it was not too serious, still you could empathise with the characters in the manner of a proper high school drama. Zooey Deutch was great and Danila Kozlovsky translated well (I've only seen him in Russian movies).The one thing that was really TOO MUCH was Lissa's speech in the end. Which I later on realised wasn't even in the book. No wonder. Can't you make just one movie without that crappy hero-speech in the end? Really annoying.This is about teenagers, vampires, magic, and high school. Is there ANYWAY you can make it merge well into a deep, insightful and life changing experience? Well, not really. But if you do a Buffy you come pretty close. That is, you play with the genre, you make the fantasy element symbolise whatever else we can fear in life: To lose your parents, forbidden love, to fight to protect the ones you love, the feeling of not being able to trust the adults around you, bullying or being left out in school, living up to a family name, et cetera.There are too many stuck up,pretentious vampire movies for teenagers out there. This story's got strong female characters who don't just weep over werewolves, a new take on the genre, lots of humour and real Russian actors playing Russians (thank you Hollywood, FINALLY!). I'd actually really like a sequel.",Vampire Academy

70,antonija_94,I love Vampire Academy,1,13 February 2014,"But I didn't love the movie. For those of you, who haven't read the books, it is an awesome movie. But for those who have read them, do not have high expectations of it. I counted the minutes before I watch it, since I waited for this movie for so many years, yet I was utterly disappointed. First of all, I like the cast. I don't like the acting. I just couldn't feel the chemistry between Rose and Dimitri. Or the protectiveness of Rose towards Lissa. It was all kind of forced. Second of all, many things were changed. Like the fact that Mia was working together with Kirova. Lissa's cuts showed on their own after she used spirit. Lissa not being afraid of the Queen Tatiana. In fact, Tatiana seemed just like a normal person, not the intimidating Queen from the books. Dimitri was smiling a lot, and those who have read the books, know that it was a rarity to him. Another changed thing was the third scene. While Rose and Lissa were being dragged to the Academy, they were attacked by Strigoi. Something that really, and I mean really, bugged me was how easily Rose confided in Natalie about her crush on Dimitri, and we all know that that is most certainly NOT the case. Also, Lissa found out about that too. That might not be a big thing for some, but for the readers, it is a huge one. They altered the storyline. At the end of the movie, Lissa gave a speech saying how she was using spirit and her boyfriend was Christian Ozera. What was with that? The movie ended showing a group of Strigoi waiting in a cave to attack St. Vladimir. The leader was Sonya Karp. This is wrong on so many levels, the main one being that the battle with the Strigoi happens in the third book, so I have no idea what they are going to do with the sequel. Last but not least, while I watched the movie I had a feeling like I was watching a parody. Which was infuriating. I will always love the books, and reread them all the time, but if there are any more movies made like this, I don't know if I will watch them.",Vampire Academy

Then this may be the movie for you, I dunno. If you really wanna know what the movie is like but don't want to waste money, just torrent it... but that is illegal so, don't.

Vampire stuff - it has been overdone and murdered but I heard the novels were good, so might as well, right? Well, guess what, I just finished a YA novel today and was reminded how much I don't enjoy the genre because of the cheesiness. And this had plenty of it. I did like the actresses (old H2O fan here), they weren't amazing in acting itself (not like the script was that good) but bonus points for having Olga and Danila. The movie setting was very obviously cheap, but I understand that they don't have that much budgeting. Anyway, I thought this movie was alright - it wasn't super awful, but it was mostly boring and overused. Definitely not what it was being hyped as earlier on.

73,evanescentotaku,Seems like crap out of 70s,4,4 December 2014,What was this movie all about not a single thing was interesting(except for the girls wearing high school uniforms damn they looked sexy).The story had potential but budgeting the movie with the plot so vast made it looked like some awful movie from 90s man. Who would believe if i say twilight and harry potter would only cost 30 million. And that's what it tries to be .Everything could have worked out great if the plot wasn't so confusing. They made the small things looked like some bigger issues was ongoing while it was just some high school girl making boys do all the dirty work for some private time with her.I highly recommend you to watch it if you have got nothing else or if you can't sleep. It will make you sleep after knowing that the first half is all about girls tricking the protagonist to believe some random life threatening things was going on while it was just bullying for some random revenge issues.

74,jacksakes,"Confessions of an over-the-YA-aged, non-VA-book reader",5,7 February 2014,"This is my first review and it's really odd that it's going to be about Vampire Academy. But I'm a sucker (no pun, really) for escapism literature/movies so YA has been my stomping grounds as of late.ProsZoey Deutch is very refreshing as Rose. For being as campy as the trailers suggest, she had a lot of work cut out for her to give this character range and she nailed it, most of the time. Her spunk is very in tune. The parts where she had a crush on a certain male partner took a little stretching to be believable, because the chemistry wasn't there and it was hard seeing this outspoken dominant female who would be the kind to initiate a kiss, to be so gushy and sweet on this guy. But you know what? That is me being critical from an acting standpoint. In real life situations, we are all not so smooth with our emotions either. The Psi-hounds at the end were done really well. This I can tell is where the most money went into the CG effects. They looked better than the muttations from THG, they looked way better than the wolves from Twilight.Funny thing about the trailer, is many people were worried/complained about too much MEAN GIRLS plotting in the movie. But the movie had so much story to fill, the high school click stuff really went by fast. And in fact I was intrigued in wanting to get to know more about the whole school scene. There was maybe one classroom session and it was brief and part of the story (can be seen in a clip with Mia), so Harry Potter this is not. At least not from the 1st book/movie standpoint. I loved the ending. I predicated who the villain would be but to see the dynamics of what this villain became, made the fight so awesome to watch. I love how this villain carried his/herself and the fighting here was very raw. You could see Rose getting banged up and hurting. So believable.ConsNothing really stuck out in most of the fight scenes. They were down and dirty, involving multiple people and they got the job done. Editing-- especially with Dimitri knocking down Rose and ending up on top of her-- was choppy in some parts. A scene where Dimitri fights Rose came off hokey. The way she flew was cool, the way she was stopped was not. Mia's acting is somehow better in the movie than in the trailer, but still comes off hokey in the classroom scene I mentioned earlier. A teacher wouldn't fall for her overly fake tone to incite him to read the note out in front of the class.Maybe I missed a few points, but some of the setups of what was done by the villain of the movie was just weird. Killing animals? And I understand that the Moroi are kind, but I had a hard time believing that she would be so horrified of blood, even if it's from her own animal.",Vampire Academy
75,ldickinson-1,Great new twist in the vampire genera,7,31 May 2014,"Loved this movie. It is a kind of 'Who's going to do it' written in the style of a 'Who dun it'. Lots of plot twists and turns and fun trying to figure out who's who. Complete with red herrings. Don't blink or you'll miss clues. Honestly, most of the writers who gave it bad reviews admitted that they didn't understand the plot. You don't need to read the books to follow because I've never read the books and I had a ball. Be warned you can't sit back in this movie; you have to stay alert if you want to get the full entertainment value. A great thrill ride getting to the end and 'oh my gosh'does this movie ever need a sequel.I like the casting. Zoey Deutch and Lucy Fry had good chemistry.

The movie was too quickly-paced and ill-conceived for me to enjoy it. This film reminds me of a pseudo-vampire, fantasy-themed ""Mean Girls"" made by eager fans of the romance series. It was entertaining, but if the book is anything like this movie, then it is no wonder that I've never heard of it until just when the movie was released.What else can I say? The fight scenes were obviously scripted, the combat was unbelievable (and not in a good way), and the acting was just good enough to be considered mediocre. If you are a die-hard fan of the novel series, or you really like fantasy and vampires, then perhaps you will enjoy this movie despite its numerous flaws.

It wasn't terrible, but it was confusing at times trying to keep track of the different species (or whatever they were) and the movie was mostly unclear as to why they were trying to kill or protect each other. Some of the scenes were very unbelievable, although a few were funny. The martial arts choreographing was horrific. The movie overall was basically a combination of Twilight, X-Men, Harry Potter, and Underworld... without the solid story lines or script.I'll give it a four rating because it didn't completely suck and I liked the girls, but it could have definitely been much better.

The movie screams ""Young Adult novel adaption"" in all directions, but it is absolutely refreshing in a world full of YA dystopias. The movie is fun and light-hearted. The actors are great (especially Rose is reminding me of a younger Detective Rizzoli and Lissa is full of grace) and very likable. The movie feels a bit rushed, it tries to put a lot of plot points into a movie that would have felt better in a series' season. It is clear this is a book adaption and as such you have to fill in some blanks by yourself, like the road-trippy shopping mall event that distracts from the main plot and feels out of place. It's not the most genius movie and some things are quite obvious, but it is a _well done_ movie with good characters, entertaining interactions, and a nice narrative. I was afraid some of the characters would fall flat (especially Dimitri) but it turned out they were well characterized.

83,Blu_Flash98,So much wasted potential,4,21 April 2014,"First and Foremost, major spoilers ahead. You have been warned. ""Too long, didn't read"" version at the bottom.Vampire Academy is a movie based on the book series of the same name written by Richelle Mead. This isn't really the kind of movie you come into without reading the books. If anything, this movie appeals more to the fanbase than it does the general audience at which it was supposedly targeting. The script was great, for the most part it followed the book but it was still extremely weak. Mostly on part of the actors. Rose Hathaway is a dhampir who comes across as a selfish, spoiled brat with a tough exterior. She has a special bond with her best friend, Vasilissa Dragomir, the last of the Dragomir line.Vasilissa Dragomir, on the other hand, is a Moroi. The Moroi are vampires, but not quite the vampires everyone knows and loves. That would be the Strigoi, the soulless undead. A Moroi can only become Strigoi by draining a human of all their blood or by drinking the blood of a Strigoi. Strigoi are extremely strong, fast and dangerous. Unlike the weak Moroi who rely solely on their Dhampir guardians. Amongst the Moroi are 12 Royal families. One of which is the Dragomir family who, with the exception of Vasilissa, were all killed in a car crash. The Dhampir are of mixed blood. They come from the union of a Moroi and Human. Due to this, Dhampirs are considerably shorter than their Moroi counterparts but are stronger physically and have better endurance. The Dhampirs job is to guard the Moroi. The Moroi come first. The Dhampir are trained to become Guardians. However, due to certain circumstances, Rose Hathaway and Lissa escape the school they are attending which is known as St. Vladimirs. Now with all this potential, the movie could have been a lot better. However, the main two actors were very poor at portraying their characters accurately. Zoey Deutch's portrayal of Rose was very poor. So much so that she just ripped off Ellen page's character, Juno. Rose is supposed to be outwardly defiant, rebellious, tomboyish, flirtatious and protective of Vasilissa. However, in the movie, she is portrayed as being more like Juno. Lucy Fry's portrayal of Vasilissa was that of an outwardly weak, meek and timid girl who cannot do anything on her own. Whilst there were moments where she showed some Charisma, her overall portrayal was extremely weak. Dominic Sherwood accurately portrayed Christian Ozera and managed to leave a good impression. As someone who has read the books, it's easy to tell which actor/actress has studied up on their character and which one hasn't. Dominic Sherwood completely threw himself into his character which is impressive considering that this movie was supposed to be closer to that twilight/warm bodies junk because that's what seems to be a hit in the box office. However, that doesn't fit with the storyline that the books promote. The books promote that Vasilissa's Life is in constant danger and that the only thing actually protecting her is the bond she has with Rose. The movie, on the other hand, promotes two girls looking for fun and romance. Most of the potential for this movie was wasted on turning it into another snooze-fest like Twilight and Warm Bodies. Yes, Twilight has vampires and humans. Warm Bodies, on the other hand, has zombies. Whilst both have ""supernatural beings"", they are not the same. Nor should they ever be portrayed as such. The Movie had a couple of funny moments but that didn't necessarily redeem it. If anything, it was obvious that the side actors were the only ones who had accurately portrayed their characters. Danila Kozlovsky accurately portrayed Dimitri as the ""God"" he is praised as. Gabriel Byrne portrayed Victor Dashkov in such an accurate way that he became the character. There is a huge difference between accurately portraying a character and becoming the character themselves. Had I not read the books, I would never have known that Victor was the villain.Too Long Didn't Read,The books focus mostly on Vasilissa's life being in constant danger and Rose's journey to becoming a guardian and dealing with her feelings for her mentor Dimitri as she hones her skills. Rose is hasty and eager while Vasilissa is patient and charismatic. The movie takes the storyline that is supposed to be dark and edgy and turns it into some twilight meets warm bodies crap. In short, go with the books. The Movie mostly appeals to the Twilight/Warm Bodies fanbases.",Vampire Academy

And sorry for my language, hope this is approved anyway... The movie is so full of mistakes, bad acting, wrong actors and the point of the story is completely wrong. I read the book and i can say it was much deeper than this. Come on, a strigoi attack at the beginning? Why, it isn't in the book and completely contradicts everything, the wards, the fact that Rose never saw a strigoi until the *end*, that somehow Spiridon was there when he should have been with Victor because there would be no far guard because of the protective spells put on academy which are much further from the building, that Dimitri wasn't able to beat the strigoi and that there were so many of them, that the only way to kill them was a stake, when there is decapitation, setting them on fire, sun that burns them. At the begging Rose should be weak from blood loss not fighting other guardians, she only attacked Dimitri, she couldn't have gotten that far. I mean i could go on and on, if you watch the movie you'll see that this is only first 20 min or so of the movie. Dimitri character is described as a god which this actor certainly isn't and Rose seems so shallow, Lissa doesn't seem sweet as described to be. Kirova? Really? She just seems mean and like a vendetta in the flash. Why? She is just strict and annoying with her lectures, but nothing like this. I get that it's hard to make a good book to movie adaptation but this would be bad anyway, really, really bad. Hadn't anyone read the script twice? I can't believe someone actually liked this, so many lines were off, not funny and unnecessarily changed, like the note that was really passed on between Rose and Lissa not Mia and that wasn't the content of it either. This is mockingly sad for vampire academy. If you really want to know about moroi, dhampirs and strigoi, read a book, don't bother with this.",Vampire Academy
87,arpitadash2011,This movie would have been good if it has the proper casting and magnificent dialog.,3,12 June 2014,"I have waited so long for this movie as I am a vampire academy (novel) series fan but this was much more bellowing my expectation label. Richelle Mead's sharp series of young-adult novels might have been better off being adapted for long form TV, rather than the big-screen.I think this movie will be quickly forgotten, which is probably bestTo start with I have problem with everything regarding this movie, starting from movie poster to cast and acting. The movie poster is not quite attractive i mean pink and green. Richelle did a great job by adding horror, comedy and action to the young adult romantic genre but the movie was really a shame as Daniel Waters wrote the screenplay for HEATHERS, which is one of the really nice films about school, though I still have not seen it. The foremost disappointment was Dimitri Belikov, from the expression of books i had mighty expression on him but the cast director clearly tried because the actor Danila Kozlovsky is actually Russian , although, I don't think they ever gave Danila a chance to actually speak in Russian? So, what was the point? I'm just saying, He seemed a little too old (seems like in his thirties) for Zoey Deutch's Rose, and he did look the worst in male-ponytail. The main issue though is that Danila Kozlovsky and Zoey Deutch had none of the chemistry that Rose and Dimitri have in the books – which was the sorrowful thing for me as vampire academy series is one of my favorite novels. I also did not like when Dimitri called Rossa out of affection.While i am talking about casting then Lucy Fry as Lissa Dragomir was another upsetting thing. I think Lissa is very dull and boring in this movie. Sometimes it's hard to read her expression and while hypnotizing people she was just expressionless. But what i hate the most is her mouth; she even can't talk properly with her fangs. Another fact is that Lissa and Rose's being shadow-kissed shown horribly in the movie. The one or may be only good thing about this movie was Zoey Deutch as Rose; she really tried very hard to hold on to her character in this movie. I am serious she is just fabulous in her comic tone and serious lines. Here the director tries to cover whole book in 104 minutes but fails to do so. The plot was awful as it was difficult to understand what's happening so was the dialog.

90,misskrissy85,Where do I even start...,1,12 June 2020,"I tend towards being kind. Actually that's a lie, but I do try not to be overly harsh. Let me start by pointing out that I have no idea what it takes to direct or produce a movie. In saying that, I am thoroughly disappointed by this film. I weep at the direction they went. They could have approached this like the Harry Potter movies where some parts from the books are missing (enough not to slow down the feel of the film). However that is not how it went. Instead they butchered the series to the point where they could fit every book into one movie. In doing so it plays out like a chaotic mess which may have been directed by someone with ADHD. It could have been a franchise but instead it sank like the titanic after hitting an iceberg (the iceberg in this case being the script).
On to the list of problems... hopefully in orderFirst, Lissa feeding on rose in the first few minutes... in the book rose is conflicted with the feeding. Becoming addicted to it yet hating the craving for it all the same. I didn't get this vibe at all. Honestly it was like Lissa bit through her skin, pulled away, and voila sedated.Issue number two, a scene away from the first issue. Rose sees the guardians from the window (right enough to what the book portrays) but the roommate guy who Lissa controls for his car keys is absent. The back and forth in the book where this happens explains how wrong their society feels this gift is to use, and is a glimpse into what Lissa and her race can do. Even if you feel this isn't important to the movie the next part also gets it wrong. Her meeting with Demetri is wrong. I honestly cannot go into each flaw because this is becoming an overly long review as it is, so just take my word for it (I've read the series 4 times I think I know).Jump right into the mistakes following and I'll be shortThe arrival at the school did not go as the books did, then the teacher who also has control over spirit is somehow already gone from the school (here is where we start jumping books and mashing tidbits into the script so you can try to keep up with the plot), then Christian enters into the mix, followed by the evil uncle, and a budding romance has already begun to build between demetri and rose which is fast even by Hollywood standards.As you can see we have already left the greatness of the written series behind, and believe me when I say it continues on this way until the end of the movie.On a side note the actors and actresses do not portray the characters as they are written. Rose in this movie is timid and more childish, lissa is more deadpan and less depressed or socially awkward, and Mia also overly childish and the comebacks that come out of her mouth are just....ugh.No offense to the actor playing demetri but I don't feel he fits the roll either.This is mostly the first 30 minutes of the movie, and as I said, the review seems a bit too long as is. I will stop here with nuances of my disenjoyment (yep made that a word).Suffice to say if you read the series you may feel as I do about this particular movie. However, if you are within a younger age group (anything 13 and under maybe) and haven't read the books you may just like it.. weirder things have happened.",Vampire Academy
91,angelreborndark,Worst sound ever for a movie,5,31 May 2014,"It's like they didn't do post-production audio editing. The sound keeps oscillating between extremely low and damp during dialogs and extremely loud and uneven during fights and ... i used the volume button between every scene to get a hold of what they were saying. The fights are somewhat made up with not regard to real physics, it's like they are dancing and that their every move is coordinated and approved by the director. It's no natural movement, even if it's a dhampir, vampire, whatever the heck they are called movie. I find more comfort in watching a Chinese old movie in which they flew all over the place rather than watching these really old teenagers fight Strigoi(which by any book written in the language the word comes from they are not blood-sucking beasts).",Vampire Academy

I love the story and the characters so I was beyond excited to finally see this adaptation. Is it a perfect movie? No. But it's raw and stays very true to the books. It's obvious that the movie didn't have a high budget like some of the other YA adaptations out there, so if you're looking for amazing visual effects, this isn't a movie for you. I actually think they did well considering. What truly spoke to me the most about it is that they kept so many scenes from the book untouched. As a fan I really appreciated that. I liked the dialogue, the humor wasn't too much. It was rushed at parts, but it didn't bother me. The cast was amazing. I loved Zoey as Rose, she was so much like Rose in the books. Danila was also perfect as Dimitri and their chemistry is very believable. Dominic as Christian also pleasantly surprised me. Overall it was a great adaptation and is a must see for every Vampire Academy fan out there.",Vampire Academy

I didn't like the idea and what happens to the teacher who was going to inject rose and got the injection instead what was she still doing in the academy i don't understand that at all.please explain.Anyway, i feel like i was entertained for some parts and was forced to watch the whole movie.anyway it wasn't super bad but it was surely korney in a way.It would be better to be shown on the TV or DVD.Or maybe my taste in movies are higher.

94,psugirle,Fun movie - true to the book!,9,2 December 2015,"I don't know why everyone seems to have a huge problem with this movie! Actually thought the movie was fun and stayed very true to the original book.I saw a lot of disappointment on the casting of Rose/ Dimitri. I actually thought they did a FANTASTIC job casting. I know in our own minds we all have our own thoughts on what each character will look like, but even the author Richelle said she thought they got the casting right, and it was fantastic. I thought Danila Kozlovsky did a great job as Dimitri. I think he captured the tough, brooding, powerful, and sweet side of Dimitri. When I watched the movie and read the book, I definitely saw Dimitri. I also liked Zoey as Rose. She had a great amount of Sass and brought her character to life, and I did feel the romance blossoming between the two as the movie went on.Now, that being said...there was a few moments where the writing was just awful or way to corny - maybe that being why some people felt the movie wasn't that great or had a hard time with the actors being pegged for the characters in the book. For example, in the lust charm seen with Rose and Dimitri - even I had a hard time seeing Rose say, "" sweet sassy molassey"". That was just terrible. All in all though, I did think the movie did a great job in capturing all the important essences of the book, and I did think they did a great job with the casting. I'm a little disappointed there won't be more movies since the books were so fantastic and we would have more opportunity to see these characters progress on screen....but - For anyone who love the book/series, I do recommend watching this movie it was cute and fun!!",Vampire Academy

Both for the people who have read the books and those who haven't - these things are:>>Dimitri is not as sexy as you thought he would be In the character's defense though, he isn't meant to be your stereotypical ""hottie"">>This isn't an action, over-dramatised, pre-teen fantasy.

A good hour and a half of entertainment, young good looking actors. Except for how it turned out in reality: it was painful to watch. The acting was bad except for the actors who played Rose and Christian respectively. The whole thing just reeked of clichés, for the most time made no sense, was all over the place. I assume this movie had a big budget but it felt all around wasted on this project. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they liked movies with pretty faces, bad acting and chichéd plot.

And also over all those complains over the actors, you know people, in the book you have an imagine of how a person looks, and they never can get a actor that looks exactly like that imagine. Also, i have read that many people complain because there is a Russian actor in the movie.. uhh.. are you kidding me?

98,BuzzHanks,"A Fun, Very Cinematic take on what a book adaptation should be",10,7 February 2014,"This is what the Twilight films should have been: A rousing, energetic, very enjoyable take on the vampire genre. It is well paced, full of charm, personality, and just feels very cinematic-ally presented.The film tells its story through very clever uses of flashbacks that correspond with the dialogue and information presented (which quite frankly is recently lacking in not only book to film adaptations, but movies in general for that matter). It even showcases the film's 3 vampire types featured through use of words on screen. Including narration by the film's protagonist Rose (Zoey Deutch), making a star making turn reminiscent of Robert Downey Jr. in the first Iron Man, turning an often bland role into a charismatic, quippy, sarcastic, wise-ass deadpan, that along with an amazing supporting cast full of personality and wit (particularly Sarah Hyland's Natalie, bringing in an equally as amusing performance that stands out being very genuine), alongside the astonishing visuals and crafted storytelling, makes one feel as if they are experiencing a world, not just a work of fiction. The work is fairly easy to follow, and even if you miss some information, you get it back in later scenes that explain it when needed. It makes the movie re watchable many times over in a fun way to get even more pieces of the world presented that you missed the first time around.Like the final Twilight film, this movie showcases the different talents that vampires could have, from controlling fire, to having power over it and all other common elements such as water and air. The special effects to showcase those elements look surprisingly realistic for such a low budget film; you can feel like fire is realistically sparked, or that water is flowed from one source to the next. Some particular creatures featured later in the film are obviously CGI, but are nonetheless very well designed (directly from the author herself) and very kool to look at.To speak of the action, it is well choreographed and exciting, plus even comedic at times. The way it is portrayed in the story is well done as a character arc. You feel the fight training that Rose goes through, and sense her determination to get better. This is another thing presented that is commonly lacking in most movies these days: actually showing how a character can not only do such extreme things, but how they FEEL doing such extreme things, which equals how they can do these things and not just all-of-a-suddenly have this ability to do these unique things and feel confident and genuine in doing them.Humor is a key element in this film, as it showcases Rose's true characteristic of sass and impulsive natures. Its not overly silly, yet adds onto the naturalism of a teenager's life, and the types of situations that they go through. This film does suffer through some clichéd and somewhat stupid moments towards the 2nd half of it (though in hindsight, those moments were portrayed pretty well to lead up into what happens and to keep it simple and easy to follow). Yet, you find yourself more endorsed in the episodic structure that brings the feeling of high school life, while also portraying the feeling one has when reading the book and going through these episodic moments that lead up to the bigger story experience. It makes the film feel organic and natural, and not just a flat, simple structure to get from point A to B. I would recommended this movie for anyone who loves ""real life"" combined with fantasy, particularly high school drama that is not too fluffy, and relatable. A solid adaption that captures the mood, tone and energy of the books, and is viewable for those that have not even read the series.The Author of the books even said that she LOVED this film too",Vampire Academy
99,a-johnson1-889-722682,Probably one of the worst films I've ever seen,2,30 April 2014,"I'm not familiar with this book series or the author who wrote it, but I love science fiction, I love action and I love vampires. After seeing this, I actually want to watch the entire Twilight series. I understand this is like a Vampire flick for chicks but come on, most of the teenage girls I know aren't all over the place like this. The entire concept of this series is just laughable. If a Vampire can control the elements, why on earth do they need a human guardian to protect them? Why not just learn how to fight and protect yourself? It just doesn't make it sense.The entire film was so fast paced, I didn't have a chance to breathe. Everything was happening so fast. The plot, the characters, the backstory and could you have a more annoying protagonist? The bullying aspect of it was just lame. I mean I don't know how to properly construct my review because there are so many things wrong with this movie and that's just the first thirty minutes.Despite people calling it low budget, that's irrelevant. It's not the budget or the roster of new actors that made it bad, it was the script, the directing and the actor's actual acting ability that was horrid. I mean did anyone stop and say, ""maybe we should rewrite the script a little bit more"". Did the director think the audience was mentally challenged and wouldn't follow the plot? As a movie goer, I'm slightly offended at the lack of intellect this movie possessed and Vampires are supposed to be highly intellectual and endearing. This movie was just a really bad mix of Twilight and Mean Girls combined into a horrid movie. Do not see it. Do not see it. Do not see it!",Vampire Academy

Hopefully there'll be one.I am telling you, try it, you just might love it. Watch it and judge it yourself. Believe me, because i am one of those who didn't really wanna watch it but ends up loving it.

Most of what I seen has been not met by certain standards although some elements apply to screen writing as pure dumbstruck. For the least of the doubt, there hasn't been a film in which was ranked the lowest of votes. Some would argue otherwise. Since Vampire Academy's release in February 2014, one out of three people have viewed this and questioned the value of the making of Vampire Academy. The judge persists on audience on how it was reach to target young adults to like liking of vampires such as Twilight. With the world watching the romance of a human and a vampire suggests that it sold out many tickets than what was made from the film I saw February 14. In conclusion, the film ranked to be the top 100 worst film ever madeAfter reading and watching the first book leading to the next six there were some insights recognized that didn't make it in the first review. First of which the humor spread to a sensual outlook followed by an emotional debut between Rose Hathaway (Deutch) and Dimtri Belikov (Koslovsky). In many cases the idea of friendship striked up the audience well to see the difference between two people who care for each other--acting and the other to be yourself--reality.",Vampire Academy

The script was pretty chaotic, if you haven't read the books yet you won't understand a thing. I know the books pretty well and even I was confused about which direction the movie was supposed to be heading.The worst part for me was the acting. When you make a movie based on a book, the least you expect is the actors match the book characters by a bit. And Zoey Deutch is not a good Rose to me. Worst of all, her acting was really poor, she completely fell flat and it was almost painful to watch.

Rose, my favorite character in the books, is completely ruined by this girl (Zoë Deutch or something I thought) that doesn't have any of Rose's style and sass. Her acting was also very poor.

104,katjasoana,Mark Waters was this movies biggest mistake,6,19 October 2014,"I have read all the Vampire Academy books and can definitely understand people's frustration. I agree that this book-to-movie adaptation could've been executed better but some of the things people are criticising the movie for are plain stupid!Firstly, the casting in my opinion was great! Okay yes Rose may have been described as being a bit more curvier but remember that she is also a trained guardian, she still has to have a fit physique and can't be seen strutting about with a Nikki Minaj type bum! and saying that someone isn't fit for a role because their ""boobs are too small"" is pathetic cause at the end of the day would you rather have a proper actress or just any person with big tits?Danila been cast as Dimitri was also great because for once we had a teen movie that didn't feature a typical hottie with blonde hair, blue eyes and a gorgeous Hollywood smile! Yes he may not appear attractive enough for some but I thought he was a superb choice, plus he had that proper sexy Russian accent that could not have been faked by an American teen heart-throb.I also enjoyed most of the dialogue especially parts that were directly from the book :) I guess the only thing I didn't really like was the fact that it was directed by Mark Waters, although Mean Girls was a totally popular teen movie I feel like he wasn't the best choice to direct Vampire Academy as the books are not as tacky and cliché as Mean Girls. Also the parts about Lissa's insanity due to being a spirit user were pathetic in comparison to the book.I feel like this movie would've been far better with a different director as it would not have been made into the tacky vampire version of Mean Girls that it is, such a shame to see this wonderful book series get so many negative reviews all because Waters was unable to accurately grasp the mood of the book. I hope that in future book-to-movie films, authors will work closely with directors to ensure the right outcome is reached.",Vampire Academy
105,katrinasimpson,Excellent! *SPOILERS ALERT*,10,15 April 2015,"*SPOILERS ALERT* Truly a great movie filled with love, humor, action, adventure, romance and fantasy. I have watched the movie many times since and have loved it each and every time. In particular I think they portrayed the main character Rose Hathaway extremely well which is a great credit to both Zoey Deutch (actress) and Mark Waters (Director). Area's of the film that I found that were not as good as the book were Dimitri's very first confrontation with Rose, Lisa's speech at the end of the film, not enough Rose and Dimitri romance (they seemed more like friends) and when Rose punches Mia. I also think that Danila Kozlovsky did a great job acting as Dimitri Belikov but his physical image did not live up to the books character description. Having said this, if you had not read the book as comparison these criticisms would not be a topic of discussion. Overall a fantastic movie with a strong and engaging storyline.

107,waynerad,Amazing if you can get past the issues understanding the story,9,30 June 2014,"OK, I feel I have to explain why I'm giving this movie 9 out of 10, especially as I am far from this movie's main demographic (I'm male and 43).First of all, I went to see this movie because I had it on a list of movies to see (and I'll spare you the story of how the list came to be because it doesn't matter here), and I went in not knowing anything about it. Not only that, but I didn't see any of the ""vampire"" stuff that preceded it -- like the Twilight series, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Vampire Diaries or whatever. That probably matters because when I went into this movie, my memory of vampire movies was bats flying into windows and not a whole lot more. So I was like, whoa there's this whole highly evolved mature vampire universe in this movie! I was impressed by how much there was to it, even if I didn't understand it all.Which brings me to the one flaw in this movie and why I couldn't give it 10 stars -- which is that it's hard to understand. There's serious flaws in the marketing, and this movie could've done a lot better with better marketing, but this is the one flaw with the movie itself and it's pretty serious. (A lot of other people have criticized the marketing -- the trailer, the green posters, etc, and it's all true, the marketing was bad, but I'm going to skip all that and focus on the film itself.) A first-time viewer, unfamiliar completely with the VA universe, is lost and doesn't understand why what's happening is happening.But the movie gave me a funny tingly feeling and I was intrigued by that so I saw it a 2nd time. In between the 1st and 2nd viewings, I read up on the back story -- learned all about the different vampire types and the different magic powers they each have and so fourth. The 2nd time I saw the movie, I felt like suddenly I *understood* it. I understood why what was happening was happening. The story is like a jigsaw puzzle; all the pieces fit together tightly, and if you miss a few lines you get lost. Even lines that seem like they are just there for comedic effect are actually integral to the plot. The emotional effect was a lot stronger the 2nd time.I wondered if the way the book was written was with the author just telling the reader the relevant bits of back-story as it went along. I was curious so I got the first book. Sure enough, that's exactly how it's written. But actually it's worse than that. There's a lot of scenes in the book that are actually flashbacks, that are missing from the movie entirely. The movie has a few flashbacks but the book has more. So the movie viewer is missing back-story times 2 -- once from missing the information that is simply stated as the story goes along, and once again from missing flashbacks that provide back-story as the main story goes along.I finished the first book and got halfway through the second when the DVD came out. Just watched the movie for a 3rd time on DVD and this time I noticed there's a bunch of stuff in VA that actually foreshadows stuff that comes later. So not only is the viewer confused by missing back-story but is confused by stuff that won't be explained until later movies (if any later movies get made -- which doesn't look likely, but one can always hope.)All in all, I have to say, the VA books are *very* hard to make into movies. I have a feeling other books, like the Harry Potter books, are more ""plot driven"", with Character A saying X, character B doing Y -- everything dialog and actions taken by character that translates directly into action and dialog on screen, and everything more or less in chronological order. I haven't read any HP books so I don't know. But I have read some VA and VA is *definitely* not like that. I think the filmmakers underestimated the difficulty of turning these books into movies and the special care they would have to take to make sure the viewer has enough prior information to understand everything that's going on on screen.Which leaves me at saying, VA is a truly amazing movie, but you have to more than give it a chance -- you have to actually work for it. Reading the books is best, but at the very least you need to know a lot of back-story in order to understand it. The different types of vampires, how they are related, what their magic powers are, what their strengths and weaknesses are, and how the vampire academy (St. Vladimir's) came to be. If you do this, the movie can evoke some surprisingly strong emotions. I wish I could give it 10 stars just for that because it's magic; it's different from any other film I've seen. The visual style of the film is amazing. The technical stuff, like sets, props, editing, pacing, soundtrack, special effects, etc, is all very well done. The actresses who play the two lead characters (Lucy Fry and Zoey Deutsch) put in amazing, top-notch performances. Unfortunately I think a lot of people didn't have the patience to really understand the story and panned the movie. With so many other great movies to see in the world, I guess I can't blame anyone for doing that. But if you can get past that flaw, and yes it does take extra work on your part as a viewer, VA is a great movie. That's pretty much what it boils down to.",Vampire Academy

111,da_crazy_mahn,How to not start a franchise,4,18 May 2014,"Let me start by saying that I have read the books and I really liked them. I have no negative preconceptions about young adult vampire books.However, everything about this film was done in a spectacularly mishit fashion:Let's start with the casting. Rose Hathaway is supposed to be a badass future Guardian of a more or less clear middle eastern descent and while other filmmakers have used purebred white girls for such roles before they at least used some tan to bring them closer to the character's description in the book (yes, I am talking about Jennifer Lawrence and The Hunger Games). Zoey Deutch is s very beautiful young girl with a nice cleavage (as clearly accentuated in this movie) but she is neither badass nor mixed. (It is a very old argument about having white people playing mixed characters on film, or even being used on the book covers.) Danila Kozlovsky is young and popular in Russia and a decent actor, what he is not, however, is imposing. And Dmitry Belikov is supposed to be this warrior god. And the most important thing is that (in my eyes) Zoey and Danila have zero chemistry together.The worst part though is the script. I read Vampire Academy and I loved the fully realised characters, each with their own backstory as well as agenda. In the film, however, we are left with two vapid girls being high school bitches (there is no really any other way to put this). I do not know if it was the relative failure of Beautiful Creatures and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones but whoever in the promotional department thought that playing up the high school aspects of VA was the way to go should be fired.This production did not have the money for the action and the special effects, the leads were miscast, the book butchered to fit some promotional idea and Richelle Mead (the author) ever sells the rights to any of her other books to the same studio she deserves what she gets.",Vampire Academy

The movie is not just about Vampires it's about life, living with bullies, living with tragedy, unbreakable friendships, dealing with selfish people who are out for themselves. Yes this film is good vs evil but it's so much more.

The VA books are AMAZING. Hands down, one of the best book series I have ever read and I've read a lot. Every detail in the books, even the obvious plot holes, are amazing and you will be drawn in from the first chapter.
But this movie? Having spikes hammered under your nails for 2 hours is less painful than watching the VA movie.
Casting is sooooo wrong. Rose seems like a snotty brat and Lissa like a stuck up ... Dimitri has somewhat of what he has in the books, but not even close to it anyway. Christian is probably the best casting choice, but I suspect that its Dominic's superior acting abilities in play more than the actual casting choice. Dont even get me started on Mason, Jesse, Victor, Mia or Natalie. No. Just no. Kirova I can live with. Even Tatiana I can live with. But the rest? No. I'm so glad they didn't get to cast Adrian because that would have ruined the books for me.
The script.. oh god, how many horrible words can I find to describe the problem with the script? Not enough. Sorry fans. It's just that bad.

115,brooke6790,People don't know what's good!,10,25 May 2014,"I honestly love this movie, maybe it didn't hit all the points but what book turned movie ever does. I'm tired of broody vampires, ones questioning their humanity and such. There was no brooding, no hopeless romantics really going on. I May be a little bias since I've read the books, but I think all that does is give me a better understanding of the back story. I love the sarcasm that may be laid a little thick, but in all honestly it rings true to how I act around my friends and such. There is a level of realism in the fiction. Suck that only half of the budget was made back, but I hope it does not Keep it from some day having it's sequel. And if I'm being honest to refer to my title, people don't know what's good. I mean there dozens on installments of Jason, Freddy, saw. South Park an the Simpsons have gone on way too long. Twilight was able to finish is series as as moves and there was no real depth to the story. Laden with so much unhappiness that the happy parts don't feel so happy, more of a we have to have a happy ending so let's make sure it happens. I know my review seems to not be solely about Vampire Academy, but it baffles me what people consider so good to keep making more when they should have stopped before the first was released. So I think that Vampire Academy is a little in your face and maybe a bit confusing if you can't keep up. But as a whole the story is of course good seeing that there are 8 books. The execution of the movie may be a little More specific to whom their audience is but in no way would I call this a flop movie.",Vampire Academy
116,levato55,Its sad to see these actors/actresses bashed,10,29 December 2015,"First off Ill start by saying I had no intentions of watching this movie being a 21 year old college student in a fraternity and by no means a usual audience for movies like this. With that said I love watching movies. I stumbled upon this movie and read the reviews bashing the movie and was pretty shocked too see such negative reviews. After watching this movie I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent. I had fun watching this movie and granted I did not read the book I found myself loving the characters and the cast that played them. People have said the movie is bad because the girls are too pretty and the guy are too macho? Really? ..... Really? who wants to watch a movie with ugly actresses. Not me. I have seen a lot, A lot, of movies and this one was a really fun and awesome movie to watch. Its a shame that they arn't coming out with a sequel. But I will say the movie made me want to go read the first and second book and not very many movies have ever made me want to read. College doesn't even make me read. This movie was good and the performances from lucy fry and her fellow cast mates were not sub par. It was a great experience of a movie, not a film. Its sad the cast got blamed for ruining the movie because thats simply not true. Might I add. This is only the second review I've written out of 100+ ratings. Enjoy this movie for what it is. A fun movie with high school undertones and a pretty cast. Its worth a watch.",Vampire Academy
117,cutiegurl8,I love this movie,10,26 July 2019,I really wish they would make the rest of the books into movies. I absolutely love this movie. Rose is amazing and Zoey Deutch is perfect for her! PLEASE MAKE THE REST OF THE MOVIES!!!!,Vampire Academy
118,safura11,Vampire Academy is not another cheesy vampire movie,10,27 April 2014,"Despite what some people have been saying about vampire academy being a cheesy twisted version of ""Mean girls & Twilight"",I watched it and to my utter astonishment I loved the movie. I did enjoy every little turn out of the events even though I've read the books first. Normally I would always prefer the books to the movies but this one is exceptional I guess. I don't think it's just another cheesy vampire movie neither it is a mean girl twisted version. It's something else. Yeah maybe the trailer represented a twisted version of the movie but if you take a leap of faith and watch it, I'm pretty sure you'll like it. The characters were just perfect. I don't know why some people are complaining about Zoey playing Rose and Danila playing Dimitri cause they were just incredible. You can see how hard they'd worked for their roles cause every little detail of the book matches. Sure it's not going to be everything like the books you have imagined to be but if you already know everything then what's the fun in that? And trust me when I say you will not regret watching this movie even if you haven't read the books first cause it's just that incredible. And to some ""any kind of vampire movie haters"" Please don't compare it to Twilight cause it's nothing like that. Like a famous person once said, ""Don't judge the book by its cover"" I'm telling you not to judge the movie by its trailers. Watch it and then regret watching if you have to but don't do the other way around. The plots were perfect, there was humor, romance, action - All in one movie. I'm looking forward to watch the other sequels of this series so please stop complaining and let them make other movie versions of the books. Don't spoil this for the people who actually enjoyed the movie and are eager to watch the next part. Well some of you have sat through the whole twilight series, so why can't you show a little bit support on ""Vampire academy"" which by the way is so much better than regular vampire movies (no offense). And some of you people are complaining about the age thing, well you have the read the books right? So yeah, the age gap is supposed to be noticeable. I don't think anyone could've done a better role than the actors and actresses of this movie themselves. So in total, go watch the movie, you'll enjoy it. Even if you don't, don't spoil the chances of creating another sequel movie for those people who have loved it. Once again don't judge the movie by its trailers!! Enjoy!!",Vampire Academy
119,b-duchaine,Excellent Story / Missed Chance at being a fantastic movie,7,9 June 2014,"As a huge fan of the Vampire Academy book series I have a bit of a mixed review to write here...I feel this movie could have been both made and marketed a little better. This movie, along with the series is classified as Young Adult, but if there is one thing we have all learned from big titles like Harry Potter and the Hunger Games it's that, people reading and/or watching these titles are not only young adult and I think that was the first failure that the ones who brought the movie to life made.I think VA should get a sequel and if done correctly could bring in the same amount of money that Twilight did, first off, hopefully this company drops the sequel and another company picks it up, one that has a marketing team that knows what it's doing and knows how to reach out to more of an audience than the first one did. One crummy trailer, with crappy music and even though I've read the books and LOVE the books, I thought the movie looked pretty terrible and ONLY geared toward teens/preteens.So people, don't blame the books, the storyline, the actors, the script (which was pretty dead on for the book)...this is the fault of those who produced this movie. I've seen a lot of trolls on this site just bashing everything left and right, especially the fans...to them I say, get a life.Anyhow, to go on about what I liked about it.I thought most of the acting was good and the characters were well played and well picked. The storyline followed the book wonderfully, which is always important and the settings were pretty spot on too. And lastly, the Author liked it, loved it even and you can't argue with that, this is her vision and her dreams brought to life, there has to be respect for that.I hope to see this movie get a ""better"" made sequel and hope that it doesn't end up being tossed on the back burner because it DESERVES another chance, similar to The Mortal Instruments, which are also fantastic books.Bottom line is, the production and marketing companies needs to get their crap together and give these stories what they deserve.",Vampire Academy
120,nicole-yordan,Great Adaptation,10,19 February 2014,"The movie itself isn't the best movie I've seen by a long shot. However that being said, this is a great adaptation of a YA book. I have read all the Vampire Academy books and while I probably had higher expectations for the movie the truth is that this is pretty much how the book goes. The actors did a great job portraying the characters personalities and bringing them to life. Movies tend to condense books and leave what they consider non-essentials out. Nevertheless, this movie did a great job of condensing the series of events occurring in the book in a short period of time. I myself enjoyed the movie because I enjoyed the storyline and have some insight to what is to come.My boyfriend, whom accompanied me to see this film, did not enjoy the movie nearly as much as I did (he did not read the books). Like Twilight this film is geared more toward women and those who are hopeless romantics. If this is not you then you probably wont enjoy it as much. It has a few funny lines here and there but it's not a comedy at all, so don't expect it to be.If you're not a fan of YA books and newer vampire movies, you probably wont like this movie. Neither this or Twilight will satisfy your craving for something similar to Interview With a Vampire... sorry to say.",Vampire Academy
121,beatroute-star,"Now, you probably don't get this, because you're probably not trying...",7,20 June 2014,"I watched this movie genuinely thinking it was going to be rubbish. I didn't know who the creators were or that it was linked to Mean Girls or Heathers at all. The film was put on, I was sure I was going to mock it the whole time - if for no other reason than the fact that there is a vampire named Dimitri. I was a little humbled because I liked it.Lots of people have little reasons why they psychologically can't handle it. The fact that vampires have been shoved into little clichéd boxes - vampires must be soppy, sexy or scary - and if it doesn't hit the mark, it's bad. If it does hit the mark, it's often bad anyway. The comparisons to Twilight too could colour the lens of perception, as with prior expectations of the book.I had very few of these. Again, all I had to go on was that there was a vampire named Dimitri - for real - and that was going to keep me in stitches for the night.Not the case.I've read some negative reviews that pan the movie, but the reasoning seems to be very sparse. 'Boring' I hear. 'Waste of time'. 'Twilight money-grabbing knockoff'.Rubbish.I'm gonna woman feelings you here. We were given a story about a badass chick who... becomes even more badass. A girl who doesn't care too much what people think and who isn't bad to her friends. A girl who does what she wants and whose integral role is to protect her best female friend. That's right; no best mates, comrades, football buddies here. A posh princess alongside her bodyguard are our focal point.Boom. I hear testicles exploding.Alright, that was a bit mean, but let's be honest; this isn't something either or any gender is used to seeing on film. If we see women in film they are either a) on a journey controlled by a male/desire for a male (Frozen and Tangled, both with strong heroines who are effectively led around like donkeys by their spirit guides/future husbands) b) women who struggle against oppression (let's take Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo. Both have women whose suffrage is represented) c) girls without gender (heroines who could be heroes. Not a bad thing, but I am not Katniss Everdeen. I love dresses. I like makeup. Girls do not have to be men to be fierce).I found the film funny because it didn't hide its ultimate representation of females. Teenage girls are just about the most mocked people around. Alright, they're not avidly discriminated against, but everyone loves to tease them because the things they love 'don't matter'. Popularity? Doesn't matter. Prom dresses? You're SUCH a teenage girl. Rumours around your school? God, why did I have to give birth to a beautiful baby who would grow into a TEENAGE GIRL. Heaps of the most female centric movies work only because they work with convention and ultimately mock the insignificant world of the teenage girl. The 'Vampire Academy' works with this world, works with its characters and doesn't apologise for who they are, their age or their genders.Not only did the role of the male work only as a mirror to the all important aspect of the female journey, but the girls held the power. Rose booty called Jesse, Rose blew off the nice guy, Rose confronted Dimitri. This is a rare film where what the female character says IS the plot. Decisions are made by these women considering their own and each other's feelings first and foremost, and I think that either goes right through some people, or outright niggles at them.'I'm not sexist. I love Mean Girls, and that was about girls.' When boys play girls or pretend to be them, they jut out their hips, put on a lisp and immediately think of something critical to say about an outfit, a 'slut' or a 'hottie'. Girls do this about OTHER GIRLS. The image people have of girls is very much what was poured into Mean Girls and what lent it it's success, as is the case with Bride Wars and other such films. We are not used to seeing women get along, kick butt and drive storyline all by themselves. We are not used to seeing boys float in and out and not know if the girl has already internally attached his last name to hers. We are taught to take glee in the conflict of women: women make men fight, women make women fight.The movie was a heap of fun and never heavy. It was honest and Rose had the sentiments of a real girl.If you've seen this film and thought it was boring, I urge you to reconsider why you thought this was so.If you haven't seen it, go in and enjoy it. It's fun. It certainly breaks away from some of the fundamental sexist approaches to film.",Vampire Academy
122,re-munoz94,A Entertaining Movie with Spunk and Blood,8,7 February 2014,"I too walked into the movie thinking it was some sort of twilight based movie. However, I enjoyed the overall film for its outlandish humor and lead actress. Some parts where a bit shocking but nothing too far from crossing over a certain line. I have never read a single book of this series; although the movie does a wonderful job explain exactly what is going on and who everyone is. Vampire academy from times gave us teen angst and did over sexual most of its cast in some scenes. So if they are planning a sequel please don't shove sex right in our faces. It thought it was a movie that had potential to be a bit darker than just being only surrounded by high school problems. But the whimsically teen side didn't keep this movie from the mild gore. I would rate this movie an 7/10. Would I watch if there was a sequel? The answer is yes because this first movie attempt wasn't as big of a letdown as I had anticipated. The next movies if any have the possibility to break away from the usual ""Teen Drama"" and not hold back on the blood and guts. If this franchise doesn't want to be compared to twilight I suggest you not make it the usual storyline. Girl and two guys, the two guys want her, she is mortal and they are supernatural, not blood all glitter. So overall this movie had wit, spunky humor, mild gore, provocative scenes, high school drama, and fangs. An overall good recipe so far for the freshman vampire movie, word to the wise for the sequels if any, just step it up and leave us wanting more.",Vampire Academy

Sure, there were some minor changes, like the cat, but that is expected in book to movie adaptations. It happens! My best advice to people is not to go by reviews, actually go watch the movie and decide for yourself! You can't tell if you will like a movie based on someone else who possibly went in with a closed mind because they didn't have high hopes to begin with. I can tell you that I went in with an open mind. Yes, they changed a few things, Yes, the movie went by fast, but it was good! Like, really good! My only problem with the film was that it didn't start up again once it was over. I will be going to see it again and again and then buying it when it comes out on DVD. Vampire Academy is not the next Twilight or Harry Potter, it is the one and only Vampire Academy. Decide for yourself if you like it! :)",Vampire Academy

This movie is very true to the book. The lust charm scene was very sexy, I would watch that scene over and over again. Zoey Deutch's performance was awesome she IS Rose. Lucy Fry's performance as Lissa was well done, I like how at the end she talks back to Queen Tatiana. To all of you who think there is a strigoi attack there is, but its only a dream. Danila Kozlovsky's performance as Dimitri was so good. Dominic Sherwood as Christian was well done he knew how to make the audience feel how he felt. The only problem I had was Mia.

First off I would like to say: I love Vampire Academy, it is one of my favorite novel series and I am actually ticked off that they made this pile of hot steaming bull poop.So here are my issues (and this is just the first 15 minutes of an almost 2 hour movie): #1 Lissa has an accent???? She grew up in America, with Rose and Natalie, and They have No accent but Lissa does?!?!?!?! I am really, really confused about that. #2 Rose is half Turkish, she should be pretty well brown, she should look more Persian than white, and is supposed to be shorter and slightly curvy and muscular since she trains all the time. #3 There is no Strigoi fight when they arrived back at the school (I re-read the beginning of the book to verify this because I was SO confused!) #4 Dimitri is not hot, at all, he is supposed to be god-like and drop-dead gorgeous and this guy is a lanky, ugly, weirdo and is Not Dimitri. #5 Why is Rose so Bitchy towards Lissa??? They are supposed to be bonded to each other and all she does is bitch at her the entire movie. #6 Sonya Karp is supposed to be a red-head and actually insane.... Whoever they chose for her did not come off as crazy, just a little nosy.Anyways, I have to stop because I am so very annoyed at this pile of crap they pass off as the movie version of one of my favorite novel series because this movie sucks big, sweaty, hairy balls.",Vampire Academy

The start was good, it seemed kind of an interesting and seemingly dark concept. But it was anything but. Yet another girly vampire movie with terrible acting, poor cinematography and a script that made me pause the movie to do something else every 10 minutes. No attachments to characters, no true sense of anything in this movie. It just rolled by. I don't usually watch vampire movies with the exception of stuff like blade or darker style stuff. But I just couldn't get into this, it was going to an obvious end point, but through childish twists and acting that went hand in hand with the poor writing. I loved the main character, and to some extent dimitri, but there was no chemistry between any of the characters. Sure a few one liners that you kind of had a faint smile at, but even the worst movies have a little glimmer of hope. All in all, this was a very poorly made film, no real hard hitting actors and a script that didn't help there efforts.",Vampire Academy

I unfortunately can not stand to read books, so I end up watching these movies with no background (which is probably for the best). The main reason I wanted to watch this movie was because I saw it listed in Olga Kurylenko's IMDb profile. After I saw the previews on youtube, though, I was interested in the movie for everything else it had(vampires. . .duh!, action, hot guys, hot girls, cool fashion, did I mention action?). I think if you had expectations for anything more than a teen girl action, romance, fantasy vampire flick, you were probably setting yourself up for disappointed.

I reed the books and I have to say the story line is original and I would watch the movie series if it came out. I give it an 8 out of 10 just because it could have been better but it seems like they were holding back. Thats another time that networks do not continue what they started at least to the 2nd sequel. I am starting to think these networks can no longer recognize talent or quality any more. It gets frustrating to get involved with a show,movie, or book(that gets made into a movie) and it leaves you hanging not knowing what happens next and have to fight 10 years to get a sequel like Ellen Degeneres.",Vampire Academy

Lissa and Rose share a room in the book, And in the movie they don't. Then their was the motorcycle thing she did in the movie that wasn't in the book. i knew some thing's they might have adjusted but it's like they didn't even read the book. The girl who played Rose wasn't who i imagined Rose to look like, the girl who played Lissa either, they did everything pretty much wrong. The guy they got to play Dimitri wasn't bad but he wasn't good either. And the headmaster as well. If they are going to do book series they should do a TV series instead of movies because when they do book series that are turned into movies they usually don't get it right, rarely they do tho. what sucked even worse was that most of the funny parts are taken out or tweaked.

It's not terrible... until it is. I would've even said I liked it until the cringe speech at the end by Lissa, cutting off the queen during the assembly and preaching about how teenagers shouldn't be catty. God, that's an oxymoron if I've heard any.

The exposition is confusing and weak and it's confusing how some characters have powers and others don't. Why? Where did their powers come from? Why are the two characters connected? There's no explanations of why anything happens. It's painfully obvious the info in the books were chopped up and thrown into this movie, because the plot is so disconnected and yet seems so fast. I don't know what the main character's motives or past are besides their shared trauma and I agree with the reviewers that say there's no chemistry between the cast at all. None of the movie makes me want to figure it out, either; I don't care what happens to our main characters because they never established why we should.

After reading all the books in the series, I knew that the movie, if made well, will be amazing.Vasalisa was superb, and Cristian Ozera too was wonderful. Loved both of them. But they could have made it more detailed and expressive. Dimitri and Rose too were not too bad. But you know, everyone has high hopes for Dimitry. He is one of my favorite characters in the book, except when he refuses his natural feelings. I wish Dimitry was effective like Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore. Because the character of Dimitri had that kind of possibilities. The romance too was ineffective. It could have been more expressive. You don't actually feel they are in love. And the worst part is that many scenes were unnecessarily cut off. I felt the filmmaker didn't like the novel genuinely. And more money should have been pumped in, and the lack of it was showing.But overall it was not bad. Hope they will establish Dimitry-Rose romance in a better way in the next parts. In the novels they are hopelessly in love with each other... the film doesn't communicate that well.",Vampire Academy
141,MSanders1040,"A refreshing, new and modern spin on an overwrought genre",9,7 February 2014,"Vampire Academy is based on a popular series of books written by Richelle Mead. The movie is a great watch just for the dialog and humor.Sure, at first trailer glance it can be pitched into the pile of already has been YA fantasy movies and overdone vampire series of late on T.V. and films. But this movie( and series) is in a league of its own, smart,complex, funny, easily approachable by non-fans. Vampire Academy is a separate entity from it's predecessors and not very comparable to that which we have already seen( especially in the YA fantasy genre). This is because the stroy line focuses less on the fact that the characters are vampires and more on the relationships and struggles the characters have with each other. Mark Waters and Daniel Waters are the ideal choice as director and writers to helm the initial on screen adaptation of the first book. They bring the experience necessary to translate the particular situations we find the two main female leads in. The actors and actresses have done a good job in their respective roles, better than would be expected. Zoey does a great job with the timing of the one-liners.Vampire Academy has( and I stress this) potential in a future series and just needs to be given a chance by screen goers, who will not be disappointed, but hopefully surprised.In conclusion my two cents of the film is that it delivers on what it was marketed for, it's entertaining, action packed, and quick witted.",Vampire Academy
142,lillyvasile,Enjoyable and fun,8,16 February 2014,"I just saw it last night, and I did read the first 2 books in the series before this. I have to say that aside for special effects not being too big, this is a very enjoyable and fun movie. It left me with a pleasurable feeling of wanting more of it, which is always a good sign. So I went home and started the third book right away because i just wanted to stay with the characters a little longer. I am not sure why American critics are not happy with it, but then I do not trust their opinion. There are so many great movies and TV shows which do not get recognition because sometimes Americans have a warped sense of what is good or not. This is not a big drama, not intended to get an Oscar,no big names who are gaining/losing weight for a coveted award meant to raise their paychecks. It is just a funny, smart conversational, pretty angst-y teenagers story. Kind like Buffy in their first season :). Zoey Deutch should get credit for being very good in it, great facial expressions and good timing on jokes and drama. I would definitely go to see any sequel from now on.",Vampire Academy
143,inasinsikter,I really wish I could love this movie but I don't,4,27 February 2014,"I have read all the books. Entertaining young adult novels, easy to read and difficult to put down. Loved them even though I don't really fit the age category being over 30 and a mother of teenagers. However, I was looking forward to seeing the books come to life. I kept my expectations down, but still, I'm sad to say I was so disappointed. I really, really wanted to like the movie but it fell flat. I think it would have worked so much better as a TV-show, since the books are really about characters, and in the limited time that a movie has, there is simply no time to develop characters in the way the books do. A whole lot of time goes in to explaining who is who and what and why, and the story's twists and turns come too fast and doesn't have any time to build up any suspension at all. I found myself getting bored and wishing for the movie to end sooner than it did. It is such a pity that it was not developed for TV instead.",Vampire Academy
144,sangoporter,True and New!,10,8 February 2014,"Vampire Academy came out in theaters February 7th for my State and I went to the earliest possible showing of the movie. Now, before anyone wonders - I HAVE ready the entire VA series and the Bloodlines spin-off series; Vampire Academy was one of those book series that I literally read at least ten times, no joke.To start off, I think the film turned out wonderful! The major book scenes were present along with fresh new scenes that came together to put Vampire Academy into motion. Now, I'm not say the film was perfect. but I am saying: I think most, if not all, VA fans should give the film a chance. Despite the clips in the movie trailers and other various clips, they cannot do the film any justice. Personally, the trailers seemed to degrade the quality of what the film could have been - along with the green/pink promotional posters. Another thing I believe the film did well was explaining Moroi, Dhampir, and Strigoi. To those new to the series, they have no clue what these different races are so the explanations were a terrific idea.In Vampire Academy, many of the major scenes made it into the movie: the guardians repossessing Lissa and Rose, the chapel scenes, the lust charm, Jesse and Rose's ""special"" meeting, Strigoi Natalie, Victor's betrays, etc. Those are just a few of the many book- based scenes appearing in the film; yeah, some of Rose's commentary did get a little awkward in parts - but it IS Rose Hathaway we are talking about, she speaks and acts upon impulse. Like all book-to-movie adaptations, there were changes that seemed odd when they are apart of the book series you love. Don't let these new scenes scare you or stop you from seeing the film - they DO go along with the story line. The few complaints I had were based off technical issues, some scenes felt rushed or out of order which definitely upsets me. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the film and plan to see it again. Why? Because I would love to see Frostbite come to life as well - we get to see Adrian and Eddie for the first time then!!!I have received questions from friends and other people about my review of the film. Especially when it cam to wondering about ""Why are there Strigoi in the academy and what is all the strigoi fighting scenes about?"" My simple explanation is that there are NO strigoi within school boundaries; the guardians encounter them when returning Rose and Lissa back to the academy in the beginning of the film. HOWEVER, there is ONE scene with strigoi ""attacking"" the academy with Christian Ozera - it is not a real fight, it is a dream.Please, at least give the film one chance. If you don't like it, then at least you gave it a shot - the actors DID put a lot into making Vampire Academy into what it is, even if we don't like it. But, if you do like it, you have graciously supported the film and will help aid towards Frostbite! Seriously, don't we all what to see the picks for Adrain Ivashkov and Eddie Castile?",Vampire Academy
145,WackyHoney,"Sweet sassy molasses, this was terrible!",1,16 February 2014,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! This was BAD. I watched this with my little sisters. Off the bat, we could somehow tell it was going to be awful. We were right.It was like someone decided to make a parody of every Vampire film in existence, especially Twilight, but meant for it to be serious! WE COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING! Cheesy dialogue + terrible delivery by the actors and actresses = AWKWARD DISASTER. This whole film was an unintentional comedy. If you are not a fan of the book (apparently, this is based on a book), SKIP THIS FILM. Only watch it when you're bored, when you don't mind wasting your money, when you've already seen every movie playing and this is the only one left.When this started, we actually thought it was going to be one of those progressive films wherein the protagonists turn out to be lesbians. The best scene for me would have to be a midget Emma Watson getting punched in the face; followed by men flying around in slow-mo, getting smacked in the face by fists, a rock; and at one point, a door. And...""I have a big gun,"" said one guy holding a pistol. I thought he was joking. But he was serious. Just like this movie. Watching the brunette protagonist with her love interest really was, as the character pointed out, like watching an uncle date his niece! *cringe* And that love scene - SWEET SASSY MOLASSES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! THAT LINE. Here's half a star for jabbing at Twilight. Here's the other half for making my sisters and I laugh our asses off. That's one star for the film makers' efforts to get our money.My sisters and I are 24, 20, and 16 so we're all too old for this ""young adult vampire romance"" stuff. We wholeheartedly regret watching this epic fail of film.",Vampire Academy
146,addaalex,Much better than I expected.,7,31 August 2014,"I personally think the movie is so much better than the book. At least Rose's POV is much more endearing than in the book. The acting isn't half bad, much better than I expected (even though Christian seems to be channeling a little ed Cullen in some scenes :// but still alright). It has its flaws, it may seem like just a high school flick at times with its typical campy vampire trope. But it is enjoyable and engaging, with plot twists (one of Vampire Academy series' main strengths), badassery, friendships, themes regarding morality, what people are capable of in times of distress and helplessness and a little bit of world building to look forward to. The dialogue is good and all in all has lots of potential as a series. And it is without doubt a much much better book to movie adaptation than lets say.. twilight... Hope there's Frostbite to look forward to! Cant wait to see the other side characters from the subsequent novels!",Vampire Academy
147,cari_carter,Awesome Movie...Better than Expected,10,9 February 2014,"After seeing the first few trailers, I honestly expected the movie to be cheesy and not stay true to the books. After seeing the movie twice now (in two days), I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with how well the adaption stayed true to the books. Parts of it were funny, other parts were a bit odd, but overall, it felt like the novel. If you liked the books, you should enjoy the movie. There were a few things added to the movie, which added surprise and intrigue for those who have read the books, as well as a few things they left out that I really WISH had been in there (like more Rometri). Again, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie! I want to see it again! I really hope they continue on with the series and make Frostbite. Looking forward to owning it so I can watch it many more times! :)",Vampire Academy
148,angelfajkus,is it a good movie and is it worth it,10,8 February 2014,"This was a really good movie that people should give a chance. Just because it has vampires doesn't mean it sucks just read the books. Anyways yes there's 3 types of vampires and yes they go to school and some can do magic but the main story is about two best friends who are bonded together and what they go though as they try and survive high school (bullies, depression, cutting, not fitting in) while also learning how to survive themselves for when they leave the academy and are faced with protecting each other from the evil Strigoi! It's a funny,dark,serious,happy,sexy movie. So please like they say 'don't judge a book by it's cover' or in this instance a movie by it's title. Also lots of other authors have tweeted in congratulations to Richelle Mead about her movie coming out and how they are excited to watch it! So if other authors are exited about it and want it to be a success when they also have movies coming out this year that should tell you something. Another thing there are lots of bad reviews out there written by critics who didn't get a advanced free screening of the movie and had to watch it with the rest of society and are taking their anger out by writing bad reviews so the movie will fail! So since this is being written by a fan do u wonder is the movie perfect? No, there are some little things i didn't like but that's how it is with every book to movie adaptation there are going to be things you don't like. But mostly i really liked it and want to see it again and again!:D So if you want an honest review find one of the few good one's by the critics or find a VA fan review or even an non VA fan review because they will be better reviews. I just really ask is if you have read this entire post than it means you are interested in if the movie is actually good or not. :)SO PLEASE GIVE IT A CHANCE BEFORE YOU JUDGE IT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A BOOK OR A PERSON.:)",Vampire Academy
149,jtchill-68-659289,bad marketing,10,13 March 2014,"Because I have read all the VA series and currently on the Bloodline series. I knew what to expect as this is NOT ""Twilight"" this series is tons better. I was really hoping to get the whole series in film as it is well written and enjoyable. I felt the marketing and the line ""they suck at school"" made this sound like another Twilight goof. I really do hope that take a chance and finish the series. Even though this is a YA series, as someone who is a bit ""older"" I really loved the way the story is built, you really feel like you know these characters. In Twilight, I found Bella annoyingly needy. Rose and Demitri characters were great. I really want to see who will play Adrian and Abe, if they get that far in the theater. Hopefully, they will market it better than this one. Please don't use that stupid tagline anymore.",Vampire Academy
150,mishu_babydoll,don't listen to the critics,10,9 February 2014,"I think many people won't go watch this movie because of the reviews from the critics. Which is really sad because the critics are mostly adults in their 40-50 (obviously this is not the audience for this movie) who are being unprofessional just because the movie wasn't screened for critics. I never expected critics to love this movie of course, but they are being very rude and they really make no sense. It's like they didn't watch the movie because they still compare it to Twilight which is fine if you haven't watched VA yet but after you watch it, how can you still compare it to that movie which doesn't even have a storyline.I promise you, if you go watch this movie, you won't regret it. Maybe you're not gonna love it but you will enjoy it.And I also promise that if the movie gets a sequel (which can only happen with your help), you will love where the story goes and you will end up falling in love with this beautiful characters.So that's what I had to say.

151,kissmyasthma66,"A Treat for those who read the book, but to everyone else...",6,20 July 2014,"I can already admit that if I hadn't the book, there is no chance I would have seen this movie unless forced upon me by a bunch of my friends who like cheesy romances. BUT, I will say, I thought it wasn't going to be worse than it turned out. Everything felt rushed, the characterization sucked, and some of the dialogue was just straight boring, cliché, and unnecessary. The book wasn't one of those cute high school gossip crap where everyone becomes friends at the end. But the director and writer for the movie made the story into that. I bet everyone who hated the movie would like the book way better (at least the book made more sense and made one able to sympathize with the characters). I will say there were quite a few funny parts in this movie and the actors seemed like they had a good time filming it. But it's like when people bake without putting the love into it-- the baked goods are good, but not great. Everything seems right, but something is just wrong. I think if you were watching this without really thinking, or watching as a date movie, it's a pretty good option (at least it's not a tear- jerker). I gave this a 6 because the story, originally, was good. The actors seemed to try. The cinematography was interesting (not the slo-mo stuff though). The dialogue had some cute jokes. But this was kind of a parody of the book. I personally got some enjoyment out of this movie, and it was interesting to see a book series I've read for 5 years put to the screen.",Vampire Academy
152,keh793,A cinematic adventure that was worth the seven year wait,10,7 February 2014,"Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters was in a word, hilarious. Mead's original dialog was amazing, Waters took her guidelines and wrote a superb script that left my friends, and I doubled over in laughter. Zoey Deutch's delivery and timing were hysterical. Moreover, her on-screen chemistry with co-star Danila Kozlovsky's was every bit as thrilling and romantic as I had hoped it would be from the books. The romance was a nice reprieve from all of the high school angst (which frankly bored me but a bit but I believe the angst to be an essential piece to the beginning of Rose and Lissa's ""coming of age"") but it didn't take away from other elements of the plot. The casting was splendid across the board. I've read several criticisms on the ""white washed"" lead actress and I firmly believe that if you have any respect for the art of acting, then you won't give a damn that Zoey Deutch doesn't look exactly like the Turkish desert princess (despite actually having a heritage closely resembling that of the character she portrays). Zoey Deutch took the role of Rose and played her with all the attitude and bravado that I connect so deeply to from the books. Let me bring your attention to Danila Kozlovsky. I was thrilled to find out that the studio had gotten an actual Russian actor to play such a key role! Russian is one of my favorite accents and is one of the hardest to fake believably and listening to the actor play with his natural accent made all the difference in the world. I commend Lucy Fry and Dominic Sherwood for their valiant efforts, but when Danila walked on screen and delivered his opening line, oi, my heart fluttered. I have been waiting for this movie adaptation for seven long years and the wait was worth every second!",Vampire Academy

The characters are not developed enough, there's so much story behind them, but they don't exploit it as much as they should. The pace is to fast for some plot points and the relationship between the characters is forced, they left to much for the viewer to fill, and that makes it hard to understand some times.

Yes Zoey Deutch is an awesome actress however, she is not Rose Hathaway and Danila Kozlovsky is definitely not in any possible way Dimitri Belikov. There was no storyline between the two of them like there is in the books. And don't even get me started on the way Lissa was portrayed, just awful, everything about her was wrong, also the storyline of how she hurt herself (when Rose found her in the bathroom in the book) what the hell was that all about? I was so disappointed with this film, it is seriously the worst book to film adaptation I have ever seen in my life.

But for someone who isn't a fan of the books and haven't read them, I actually liked it. There was the usual cheesy lines and the love story, though there wasn't much of it. The romance, honestly, was downplayed. It wasn't the center of the story. And I am so okay with it. Plus points for the vampire puns. Plus Rose was actually a likable heroine.

(A few of my favorite scenes were not in it but it's an adaption so I understand the changes.) The beginning felt a little rush compared to reading the book but it stuck true to the book! But the middle and end did it sweet justice. The fighting scenes were bad ass and the elemental magic...sweet. There was a lot of humor and changes to the time line but I liked it. I yelled at the screen a lot though, as an avid book fanatic and a college student for film directing and screen writing. All over though, I love the movie as much as the book!! And it is my favorite book series of all time ;). It is NOT like Twilight--we do not have teams and our vampires do not sparkle. The Strigoi are the most typical vampire stereotypes, the Moroi feed off of blood but are mortal, and the Dhampir is a half Moroi, half human. The Dhampir's do not feed off blood. The characters in the movie were so much like the character in the book and the fans will be happy with the cast and the movie! :)Even if you are not a fan of vampires, give it a shot! It might surprise you. I highly recommend seeing the movie. It has something for everyone and if you don't like it well that's on you. You never know until you give something a shot so why not give this movie a chance?",Vampire Academy
160,guardianlove23,Vampire Academy Surprised Me.,8,8 February 2014,"I'm pretty sure everyone was a little disappointed by the first two Vampire Academy trailers. It looked very quirky, funny and nothing like the books. Even though the first book did have some humor, it was very dark, and entertaining at parts. The new TV spots seemed to showcase some of that dark humor. That plus Richelle Mead's assurance that the movie was faithful to the book convinced me to go ahead and see Vampire Academy. And I'm so glad I did. Vampire Academy wasn't as faithful as Catching Fire, but the movie definitely stuck very close to the plot of the book. While there were changes in the film, I understood them. Most of the major plot points were there - the changes were really just to make the movie more cinematic, including changing the order of certain events, the places said events take place, and adding more action sequences, like the Christian-Strigoi dream. The ending was a little more action packed than the book, too, with some more chances to show off how good these dhampirs were at kicking butt. The cast was spot-on. Man, these YA adaptations do an amazing job at casting. Zoey Deutch was the perfect Rose. Not only was she how I pictured her, she was great at making Rose the perfect combination of witty and likable. Lucy Fry was pretty good as Lissa Dragomir, and she was excellent at showing the multiple sides of Lissa's character. Danila Kozlovsky... Oh, my God. Why has he not been in any American movies before this one? I had my doubts about him, but he was the perfect Dimitri and just the right amount of sexy. For fans of the books, the lust charm scene worked perfectly, and though it was a little shorter than in the book, it was just the way I imagined it. The only actor I didn't like was the woman who played Headmistress Kirova. I can't think of her name. She was a terrible actress! Someone better should have played her. Overall, Vampire Academy was a thrilling journey, and very close to the book. Everyone, go and see it, so we can get Frostbite!",Vampire Academy

162,inkblots212,Not Another Twilight,9,9 February 2014,"I knew the minute ""vampire"" and ""high school"" splashed into movie context that connoisseurs everywhere would roll their eyes and groan in unison, penning away almost the exact same thing: ""Just another Twilight, disappointed in Waters brothers."" However, if one takes the time to watch the movie and -gasp- pay attention, one might understand that life is a whole lot more complicated in this movie than the one that spawned the ""Team X"" nonsense. And it was portrayed pretty well.Zoey Deutch and Lucy Fry are fabulous choices for Rose and Lissa, the two leading ladies in the Vampire Academy world. Zoey nailed Rose's sarcasm and knee-jerk humor to a tee, and the lines or scenes that were meant to be awkward actually were! Lucy, likewise, switched from quiet, regal Lissa to party bitch Lissa without a hitch. Were some things a little inconsistent? Well...yeah, but such is the nature of adaptations; they were replaced with transitions that made sense, none of which I can say for risk of...well, huge spoilers.Their friendship felt natural. The high school setting felt natural. Was there drama? Hell yeah - but that didn't take from the whole, because it served a greater purpose than ""you're a victim and we're going to prove it"" that is so often portrayed in high school settings. The romance between Dimitri and Rose is pretty much what's in the books, if a little accelerated. It's subtle, slow to grow, then quickly flashes as the lust - oh, I mean ""love"" - charm takes hold. ""Sweet sassy molassy"" will make you groan and grin, at least the second time you catch it, and to his credit Danila manages to wear the conflicted expressions of Dimitri, as well as his sweet ones, like a glove.For anyone likely to whine about the mythology, guess what - Moroi and Strigoi are a thing in Romania. Did Richelle take some artistic liberties? Yeah. So did Bram Stoker. (I'm gonna get a staked for that, I know it...) I've yet to hear anyone complain about dystopian world settings, like up-and-coming Divergent - though perhaps because no one is comparing it to 1984, like everyone seems to do with every vampire book ever.But I digress.There were times when sex appeal was slightly amped up, but none of it was anywhere near as bad as the teaser foreshadowed. The worst offender was probably the pleasure-addled expression on Rose's face when she was bitten, and even then...could be a lot worse. The acting was solid, pretty good, and the cast worked well together. The CGI wasn't bad, felt pretty realistic. All in all, I don't have any complaints.For any fan, just watch it. You know you want to. Fund it for the Adrian fans and eventual sights of Sydney. And please don't whine about the scene changes; you knew they were going to happen. Book-to-movie adaptation =/= everything exactly like the book. For any passing viewer, trust me, while it might not be the best movie around - that is, it won't rock your world and make you rethink your life goals - it's pretty good, and I definitely think you'll walk out with a pleased grin.It's certainly not another Twilight, so don't treat it like one.",Vampire Academy
163,laura-vincent94,Readers beware,3,18 August 2014,"Overall, I was highly disappointed with this movie. Being a huge fan of the book series, I decided to watch it with the faint hope that it was not as bad as I had heard. I shouldn't have bothered. The movie takes a great world and the characters within it and turns it into a silly, MTV style rip-off. Although I love the author for coming up with the Vampire Academy world, I am disappointed that she would approve of the way the film and ideas were presented. I did enjoy the spin Zoey Deutch put on Rose's character, but a lot of the lines were quite try-hard and cringe worthy, and her Rose was not the same as I imagined. Most of the other characters seemed wrong somehow, like the actors cast didn't quite do them justice. Maybe it's just my more mature perspective, but I only re-read the books within the last year and I don't think I've ""grown up"" so quickly in that time that my take on the characters could differ so much from the film-makers' and writers' ideas. I can only hold my breath and hope that the film franchise doesn't get as far as the more 'serious' books, as I would hate to see Rose's trip to Russia and the ensuing events ruined forever by such a poor adaptation as this.",Vampire Academy
164,AnzRoxx,Vampire Academy is too good to not get a sequel.,10,7 February 2014,"Vampire Academy is finally the YA adaptation we've all been waiting for. After disappointment after disappointment in the category, Vampire Academy finally did it all right. Not only is Vampire Academy a faithful adaptation to the book and should have all fans captivated, it is also a great flick for non book fans of all ages. Action, humor, and an incredibly portrayed friendship. Everyone in the theater laughed. The ladies behind me swooned for a certain Russian lead. People were on the verge of tears, I'm sure someone let a few slip. It was enjoyable for all people in the room. What I always praised about Richelle Mead's series was the focus on friendship as opposed to romance and the comedy. This movie does all that perfectly (director of Mean Girls, hello.) while still portraying the dark content from the books (writer of Heathers, hello.) I will say there were some pacing issues and sometimes the transitioning to a new scene was off, but that is the ONLY thing and quite honestly it didn't bother me too much or take away from me enjoying the film, so it was not that big of an issue. Was this a perfect adaptation of a great book? No, but does a thing exist? This was a very faithful adaptation, however, and as a book fan I can honestly say I couldn't imagine the movie going any other way. So, I'm here to tell you this adaptation is TOO GOOD to not get a sequel.",Vampire Academy
165,mihali_mara,A great book destroyed,1,23 May 2014,"WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS.I've just watched the adaptation of the Vampire Academy with a kind of anxiety because the books are one of my favourite series and the last thing I wanted to see was the story being destroyed by the movie which, indeed, happened. I didn't like the actors chosen from the beginning but that happened in the The Hunger Games case too, and I end up really respecting them for their work, so I decided to give the project a chance. Then, it was the trailer, which was like a joke, it simply didn't represent the book. The trailer showed to the public a group of rich teen vampires, doing almost nothing but showing how important they are, and that's NOT the idea of the books. The film starts with a completely different perspective of the first chapter. When the girls were trying to escape, Rose shouldn't have looked like going to a date, but like a girl who had just woken up and she should have been dizzy and incapable to fight. On the contrary, the film shows a skilled guardian which wasn't drained of blood like.. ten minutes earlier. Afterwards, I was confused by the scene with the Strigoi attack, and the confusion remained during the entire film. The scenes seemed rushed and some of them had no connection between them. They wanted to stay faithful to the book but they also thought mixing the scenes was a good idea. It wasn't. What made me understand something were the books so I have no idea how was the movie supposed to be understood without the books as database. They omitted some important details, like the fact that Dimitri accepted to train Rose in his free time and it seemed like it was just a normal thing to be done. Or the fact that their relationship begins with teasing and Rose being uncertain whether to trust Dimitri or not, then Rose starts to respect him and to consider him a friend and after a lot of time spent together she starts to feel something for him. It is not love at first sight! The story wasn't neither attracting nor profound, nothing from the universe Richelle Mead presented in the first book so careful. For example, in the books, Lissa is a kind, good-hearted person, the film presented her like another queen bee wannabe which, from time to time, needs her bf. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that some things didn't seem to be as important and personal as they should be. Lissa find out about Rose and Dimitri in the third book and it's not a thing that Rose is willingly to talk about, neither is the one about the Spirit. I think that the only character that was portrayed properly was Mason but they ruined some important scenes with him as well. And the end was.. really bad done. They might have thought that they won't do any sequel so they decided to end it as 'badass' as possible but, if Frosbite would be turned into a movie, how can be that ending connected with the action from Frostbite? And what the hell was Sonya Karp doing there?",Vampire Academy
166,lynndlt,Vampire Academy sucks!,5,19 June 2014,"I was very excited waiting to see the movie, but It was a big disappointment when I started to watch it, The movie really sucks, in each and every way, the script, the direction and the acting is so lame, they look overreacted. I read the books and nothing to do, I know, already, some liberties are taken when making movies but this really exceeded that, considering that in the first book that is based assumes many of the facts happened that way and they knew not many details from the first book like in which element Lissa's specialize or how Lissa finds out about the relationship of Rose and Dimitri, a lot of that happened later in the other books. They are very explicit on some things and others are really absurdities that have no coherence. It's a shame they have destroyed a book that liked a lot of people and was looking forward to see it in the big Screen, to turn out in this crappy movie.",Vampire Academy
167,dogtag0611,Well Done,8,9 February 2014,"I first want to say that I love the books and I have been a fan for about 7 years now. I was apprehensive when I saw the trailer. I was not very impressed and I was disappointed but I saw the movie anyway. When I fist saw who the cast was I was very unsure. I did like Zoey for Rose from the start, but I did not quite like the others. After watching interviews and stills of the cast I warmed up to Danila (Dimitri). I did not think Lucy fit the part for Lissa but after watching the movie I believe she did a good job. I was pleasantly surprised. I tried not to compare the cast to what I had imagined because they could never live up to the characters we, the fans, create and picture in our heads. After I got over this I really enjoyed how they portrayed the characters. I had heard that the movie was really close to the book before I saw it. The movie is close to the book, but the scenes are shifted. The sequence is out of order slightly compared to the book. Such as a scene that happened in the end of the book is in the beginning of the movie. There are also quite a few scenes added, mostly action. Some of the scenes where very nice and others were kind of confusing and could have been left out. I absolutely loved one of the ending scenes between Rose and Dimitri that was added. I would have loved to have read that in the book. Cons: The movie was very fast paced and it really did not work too well. A lot of the scenes where rushed and transitions were fast. I feel as though it should have been slowed down a bit and the characters more developed. The book had a lot of information and almost every detail was important so I can understand why it is fast paced.Pros: I loved how well Zoey did Rose's sarcasm and hot temper. I think she did well and got her spot on most of the time. Danila and Zoey had pretty good chemistry and worked well together, which is pretty important. I don't believe his character was spot on but it worked for the movie. Plus his rather shy smiles were adorable. The action scenes were cool and entertaining. I also enjoyed the way the school was designed, it was Gothic and still had a modern high-tech touch to it. One of the main reasons that I love these books (and the movie) is Rose's strong character, her loyalty and passion. She is not a damsel in distress, she is constantly growing but she also knows when to ask for help. We don't see strong women in books much, and when they are they depend so much on the male romantic figure. Rose has a perfect balance of all these. She loves Lissa so much and would do anything to help and protect her, which is what the books are mainly about. It really bugs me when others compare this story to Twilight and other vampire movies. They are not the same and the only thing they have in common is that there are vampires (which they don't even call them that). I think the movie was great and there is room for improvement but I enjoyed it all the same. I really hope others can see past the flaws, because everything and everyone has flaws. I would watch the movie again and again.I would give the movie a 7.5 rating.",Vampire Academy
168,raya-de,The review,10,8 February 2014,"It started with all the signs of a fast-paced, dynamic movie that at places showed, to a watchful eye, a little too quick shift between scenes. While this can be noticed, at the beginning mostly, it is overall graceful when it comes to story-building. It maybe is partly true that there is too much to show in so limiting a time frame. But the more obvious reason is that it simply is a movie that has a lot to show, a lot to explain, a lot of things to be enjoyed by a fan or a complete new-buy to Vampire Academy. The mythology of its world is simple but rich. It doesn't lack depth, on the contrary, there is a very strong base on which the story could take place and all the basic details were explained from the beginning without taking too much time, without being boring or too much for the audience to comprehend. Of course, I'll start with Zoey Deutch, the daughter of actress Lea Thompson and director Howard Deutch. This young woman is literally the base and the top of the movie. She brings it the energy. And this is the main reason for her astonishing portrayal of Rose - the energy of her talent. She is full of this fire that makes Rose our Rose and which makes an actress a star. This girl is a tornado. Both Zoey and Rose. But there isn't much difference, is it? Amazing is amazing. The same can be said about Danila Kozlovsky - the Russian star who played the Russian god. He brings the maturity to VA. Both as an actor and as the role he plays. When he steps in the movie turns in this wonderful mixture of tasteful action and the seriousness of a good drama. Have I mentioned that he and Zoey trained like machines for the movie? You can see it in his muscles, in his moves, in the fighting and because of his professionalism as an actor - in his face. This man is a great, seriously great, actor. Even is still the character isn't given too much time for in-depth knowledge of who truly is Dimitri Belikov, he finds a way to shine through simple things like a look, a smile, a move, a few words. He has a talent to behold, a talent the world is soon going to know about. After all, he is one of the best in Russia with so many years of acting behind his back, so many good movies with so many rewards - there are not so many actors who can, honestly speaking, say that they are the best from the best. He is. I'm serious, he is. Lucy Fry as the other part of the great friendship between Lisa Rose. It is a believable bond they have, it is one of the main story lines through all the books and it is the main in the movie. It's a bond that you can actually understand and feel. You know, after watching the movie, that it is something that lasts, that is unbreakable and so new to the genre. There isn't so much romance are there is Rose-Lisa moments. I'm so happy as a fan that these two girls had and showed so powerful chemistry. A very good performance from Lucy Fry, but, I have to confess, I'm not a big fan of her character from the books. I want so much more to be shown for the second and third and fourth and fifth and sixth ones. The performances of the other actors and actresses are no less good for their roles. There weren't many effects, there are not meant to be. But I really liked the psi-hounds - specially trained dogs in the academy. BUT - the most important thing in Vampire Academy is the story. There is a story in this movie and it's rich and vast and very smartly presented. You can't not notice it how there are so many little details that make the main story-building so enjoyable and full. And it's not a comedy nor parody of something. There is humor, witty dialogue with easy, fluid pacing that is clearly not just put there to make for a hole in the plot. No, it is mingled with it beautifully and with thought to the character roles and the dynamics of the story. Because, like I said, the story is very well layered, thought out and interesting. With its mythological background, the beautiful and detailed surroundings, the brilliant teenage girl Zoey Deutch was obviously able to portrait, the bond between the actors - everything was on its place. And there was a huge place for the mystery part by which I must say - I was surprised. I expected great performances, story and wit but mystery? I wasn't prepared for this and I was so pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere of the movie. It is dark, people. Not only because of the night setting - it was so surprisingly vampire-like for a YA movie. It managed to convey the mystery from the book in a way the book itself wasn't able to do. I would say, quite honestly, if given the chance Vampire Academy can become an icon even only because of its atmosphere. It's a mixture of so many things that are put so well together that in a graceful, almost unnoticed way, they get to you and they stay with you. It's original, it is so new that many people are scared to believe in the truth before their eyes. It may take time to be understood and rightfully judged. But it's a movie with a heart and a soul - one of a kind, this cannot be denied. And don't deny yourself the chance to enjoy it. For non-fans it can be that - just an enjoyment, but don't deny it to yourself - go to the cinema and make your day or night.",Vampire Academy
169,jacintaanderson1,amazing,10,1 February 2019,"I put this on thinking it would make a good background movie while i did something else. Wow, it was so much better than the trailer. Who ever did the promotion for it seriously failed. The actors are amazing and talented and its fast paced and funny in the right ways. The script is flawless and i never once got bored or felt the need to skip ahead. I thought it might be all teenager pettyness and drama but not at all. The characters don't do dumb things and the plot is clever and exactly what a good movie/book should be. I have watched it again and again and its been a really long time since i liked a movie that much.",Vampire Academy
170,jaunmack,Great comedy!,1,10 March 2014,"Best comedy I've seen in a while! As a real fan of the books, and who has actually read the books, I can say that this is the worst adaptation of a book e.v.e.r. if you ignore every detail of the books and go in not expecting a story line or good acting then you may just find that this is the best comedy ever. Incredibly funny film, but do need to make it clear that we were laughing at the film not with it. If i was the author I would be ashamed of this film, more so if I was an actor in it. Just to make this really clear, I wouldn't expect a sequel.WORST MOVIE EVER.PS I want my money back.PPS book is still good.",Vampire Academy
171,trims_gimti,Movie worth watching!,10,15 February 2014,"If you haven't read the books, I strongly recommend talking to someone who has, they can explain things you may have missed or don't quite understand. It's not the best adaptation but its mostly true to the book and that is very important. I think that VA is amazing, funny and movie for all ages. It cannot be compared to Twilight and HP because red line of the story is completely different! I just don't understand why people are bringing them up all the time. Is it because they cannot think of anything else to compare it to? Or they probably don't even take time to actually consider everything. So why write a review if you don't understand VA? VA has it all; action, humor, romance, sarcasm and an incredibly portrayed friendship. Only flaw that movie has is that it's too short, low budget is to blame i guess. All in all, VA is definitely worth watching!",Vampire Academy
172,vanessa71793,"Good stand alone movie, But for those who read the book I'm not a huge fan...yet?",8,18 February 2014,"So I've read all the books and have again recently, and I really enjoy the series. And recently I went to go see the movie in theater, like I've done with all of the books (Twilight, Hunger Games, etc.) Though the movies wasn't all too bad, there were a lot of changes, added scenes, changes to dialog, compacted timelines. I understand with movies that it's not all too possible to stick to it 100% because then the movie would end up being 2 if not more hours long. But what kills me is the subtle changes that aren't necessary.Dislikes: Why did they change the name from Ralf to Ray? I don't understand the logic, or really why there was love interest between Natalie and him. Yes they used ray to show he was her first kill but in the books Ralf is still around. Also why'd they change Kirova's age? She was suppose to be older and they choose someone young and attractive. Again, reason people don't end up liking vampire movies now a day is cause everyone of them is casted as super attractive and young, and when it going from book to movie (or TV show) sometimes detail to characters is important. Not to mention the job she did acting as Kirova's was kind of bad. The whole added scene with the strigoi attack when they were coming back was, maybe added to add more action to the movie which is whatever, but it didn't sit right with a hardcore book junkie like myself. The weird added dreams, the way the bond at points played into it was kind of off putting. It seemed kind of like how twilight started for me, Low budget till it hit it's groove and became a phenomena and got better in the sequels, as well as shotie acting (which like twilight got better as more movies came out). All the accents too in the movie seemed weird, at least for me. All the moroi were apparently British? or something along those lines with accents, or maybe just the royals had accents which I guess could make sense, but it totally through me for a loop, wasn't expecting it. And i don't know if the guy who played Dimitri had an accent normally but I was feeling his Russian accent, it seemed a bit forced for me as well as his chemistry with Rose at times. And the part with Mia being the one who wrote those messages (and Natalie). For one those never happened, for two it was kind of pointless... And what was it again squirting?! I forget what they called it when Mia, Jesse and 'Ray' had a threesome (which again was made clear in the books didn't kind of happen, and not in Lissa's room) some of the things were twisted like who was passing the note in class and what the note said, to the threesome etc.Likes: Out of the hole movie my favorite had to be Rose, the actress who played her, actually played her with conviction and nailed the character to a T. I didn't feel like she was uncomfortable in her role and she was what honestly kept the movie going for me, well and the hottie who played Christian ;) They picked some nice looking actor and actress as well for the movie, though I feel now a days people are getting tired of that because it seems all vampire 'things' are stereotyped as good looking. But seriously who can really complain ;) The only reason I want more movies to be made is to see what I've read come to life. As well as to see if it gets better with each movie. Like Vampire Diaries and even twilight was for me, they are good movies and shows stand alone, with the occasional hiccup or dislike of something from somebody, but for true die hards of the books it doesn't really come close to comparing.Books that get made into movies I shouldn't have high expectations for I'm coming to realize, which is a shame when the original work is so good. Again, the movie alone isn't a bad movie, though to people who haven't read the series have agreed it seemed rushed at times and the acting at points was kind of sub par. Kinda wanna know and slightly hoping for a sequel though. Many maybe confused by my review, I bash on the movie more than I really praise it yet I still say it's a good movie. To clarify, I did honestly enjoy it and hope for more also, they totally set it up for a sequel, it's one of those movies that you'd watch on a rainy day or when, being honest, nothing else is on. I absolutely hated the first Twilight movie when it came out because I read all these books THEN see the movies. It took me awhile (time to forget everything I read) to really enjoy the movies. But I still think of them more stand alone movies then books made to movies. I think you're better off that way like Vampire Diaries and True Blood a like. If you look really hard at the movie or show, you honestly won't enjoy it as much. For all those who read the books, I don't think initially you'll enjoy or like it. Or maybe you will be able to look past the changes and rushed points. Those who haven't will I believe enjoy it but it's more suited for younger teen crowds.",Vampire Academy
173,ashleywallace77,Review,8,7 February 2014,"The movie was very fast pasted. It would jump from issue to issue, without any break.There were several parts that did not match the book. There are extra Strogi scene's, and Kirova. Speaking of Kirova, I hated the way she was portrayed. She was a model want to be(she said that herself) that drank a lot of martini's. She was causing extra drama in Rose's life, like working with Mia. Also the cutting of Lissa is not how I imagined it, it appeared there, I always thought she actually did it did it to herself. The shadow kiss part they learn about much earlier, they find out more in another book about it.The major parts, and lines were there. ""If I let myself love you I wont throw myself in front of Lissa, I will throw myself in front of you."" ...and othersAlso the bird scene, the one Lissa saved, and Rose wanted it to come on her shoulder in a dramatic gesture. Yeah that scene is in there.The lust scene... It was good they had it. BUT didn't actually have sex. They should have but they did not. -_-Overall it was a pretty good movie.",Vampire Academy
174,jessica-harrison,A great new take on the genre,9,1 January 2019,"VA may not have the most realistic fight scenes, but it more than makes up for this with its unique take on the vampire genre, coupled with characters you can't help but love.

175,theundomesticfangirl,Vampire Academy is sexy and comic!,10,13 February 2014,"This is the best possible movie adaptation for Vampire Academy book. Mark Waters and Daniel Waters did a great job in turning the pages onto the screen. Not only will it satisfy the fans of the series but also the movie goers. It has drama, comedy and romance. But unlike so many other teen movies, this focuses on friendship. The bond between two girls that leans on each other when no one else does. For fans: Remember when most of the fans are so worried that it will be like Mean Girls or that it has too much comedy in it? The movie has flaws but I can vouch that the movie is as much as possible very true to the book.Most of the cast was perfection. I'll admit I had doubts with Danila Kozlovsky playing Dimitri, our Russian God that we so badly wanted to be portrayed perfectly. And he did. He did it wonderfully.Danila Kozlovsky IS our Russian God.Zoey's take on Rose was spot on. She delivered all her comic lines smoothly. Lucy's acting was pretty cool too.Dom... He is perf.And Sarah, we all knew she will be an awesome Natalie and he delivered.Directing of Mark Waters is flawless. Who would even doubt his talent?Script of Daniel Waters was spot on. There were some changes made but it was important for the film to be more composed.",Vampire Academy
176,astarrymist,It's Not Actually Cool to Hate Vampires,10,7 February 2014,"So, we all know that the new cool is to be a Twilight basher and to adamantly declare how sick of vampires we all are. Even the critics forgot that vampires are immortal. They will always be a part of our entertainment culture. We love the dark mystery of the vampire, the blood, the gore, the enticing allure. We love the power, the horror, the intrigue of the being whose problems result from having lived too long. We want vampire stories whether we forgot about that or not. Oh, look, here's one! But people simultaneously want it to be exactly like the old vampire horror movies and think it's exactly like Twilight. Guess what? It's neither. This is Vampire Academy, based on the book series of the same name, a name so horrid that even the movie itself makes fun of it. Get over the name. It is what it is. Don't let it skew your perception of its quality. It's not horror, no, though the main characters either live in fear of another race of vampires or they live to kill that other vampire race. Lots of great action, blood, and killing going on in this series. It's not a fluffy, dull, sparkling romance either. There are real vampires in Vampire Academy. The kind nightmares are made of. The first book doesn't feature them as much as the movie does, which makes the movie all the better. Fans of the books know how intense things get with this evil race of vampires, and happily, the Vampire Academy movie added more into the first story.I truly expected critics to be open minded and clear-headed enough not to be swayed by current trends, namely the one that thinks its cool to hate vampires. I thought they would see how much better this story is than the other YA movies of last year that flopped. Unlike those, this movie has some light-hearted humor interspersed throughout so as not to come off as some dreadfully serious and dramatic tale. It wasn't too comedic and the comedy didn't take away from the story. It was a perfect blending of tones, exceptionally well done like it is in the book. Furthermore, the mythology was not too complicated to understand. Even though I know the story, plenty of non-book readers understood it just fine. Objectively, it was explained simply enough. Three races. Evil, immortal strigoi who can be killed by a silver stake and who cannot go into the sun. They are after the Moroi, a more peaceful (yet not without corruption and evil of their own) race of vampires who feed on blood from willing human (whose memories are erased when they stop being feeders) and who each control the magic of one of the elements. They are an ancient race and are ruled by a monarchy, which includes 12 lines of royal families. Then there are dhampirs, half-Moroi and half-human who depend on the Moroi's existence in order for there own race to survive. Thus, they live to serve and protect the Moroi. Is this exactly fair to the dhampirs like one critic couldn't believe? No, it's not. It's a deeply culturally embedded idea, though, and dhampirs feel it their sacred duty and life's mission. Protect Moroi from Strigoi. Shouldn't Moroi maybe help protect themselves? Glad you asked! These cultural issues are all brought up in the series. The Moroi society will see change. That is to come. For now, just understand that the Dhampirs want to protect the Moroi. The differences between the races were not hard to understand at all. I think the critics were just shocked that this universe has some depth and substance to it. Instead of praising the story's intelligence and all the possibilities this initial foundation allows for, they bashed the movie for having intricacy in mythology. We've got real vampires here, people. It's not as simple as vegetarian, sparkling vampires versus blood-sucking, sparkling vampires, but it's not hard to understand.Furthermore, I loved the way the movie introduced the universe. It allowed us to grasp some of the basics from Lissa and Rose's first conversation, and then it took just a couple of minutes of our time to tell us about the different vampires. Then we get to see Strigoi for ourselves. Awesome scene!The high school drama aspect of the story is why the first Vampire Academy book is my least favorite of the series. I'm too old for that stuff. A lot of people worried that they overdid the drama, but it turns out that there was relatively little. The movie wasn't even close to being all about mean girl Mia. Rose helping Lissa with her Spirit problems and figuring all that out plus the mystery of who is really after Lissa is the primary focus. The ending sequences were phenomenal! I loved every second.By the way, I may be just a couple of years older than Danila Kozlovsky, who plays the instructor guardian Dimitri Belikov. I tell myself I'm too old to crush on him even though I love his long hair. But, my goodness, I felt like a teenybopper fan girl when it showed him strength training doing those arm pull-ups. I leaned forward in my seat, almost off the edge of it, and gaped. Wow! He played his part incredibly well. I was impressed with the entire cast, as well.I will go see it again, and I hope the curious yet skeptical will give it a chance. I hope our current culture will get over itself and stop acting like it's cool to hate on vampire stories. The vampires are back. They don't like how you think you are too cool for them, so much better than them. Watch out. Better let Vampire Academy take a bite out of your arrogance and save yourself.",Vampire Academy

Zoey, Danila, Lucy, and the rest of the actors did a fantastic job at playing the characters. I have been a long time fan of the book series.I agree with the author Richelle Mead, the movie did stay true to the books. I hope, pray, and wish their will be a part two. Vampire Academy fandom don't we all want to know who is going to play Adrian, Eddie, and hopefully much later Sydney? I highly suggest you watch it. And in all honesty I'm going to go watch it again.

178,golfgirl15,Simply Awful!! One of the worst movies I have seen in a while.,1,15 February 2014,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I was less than impressed to say the least. I thought it looked cheesy and ridiculous and it turns out the movie was even worse than the preview. I have read every book in this series at least twice. I love them, they are probably some of my favorite books I've ever read. And that makes this review so hard for me to write, but honestly this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen to the point that I created this account to write about how horrible it was. Everything in this movie was cheesy. The writing was cheesy, the acting was cheesy, the special effects were cheesy, and the directing was awful. And on top of all that the movie as a whole made almost no sense. I went to see this with my best friend, she hasn't read the books, and she walked out having no idea what was going on and what the actual plot line was. Even with me reading the books I had an extremely hard time following everything that was going on because they jumped around from different things, they should have just followed the book. Which brings me to another point... they did NOT follow the book like other people have been saying. They brought things in that happened in the third book that had no place being in the first movie. You're not supposed to know what kind of magic Lissa has nor is anyone supposed to know about roses feelings for her instructor. I am so mad that Richelle Mead sold the rights for this movie. I think that if she would've held out for a better director and screenwriter this movie could have been almost as amazing as the books. It was so bad that it almost comes across as a spoof on the whole vampire genre. Overall don't waste your money this movie is far from worth it.",Vampire Academy

I came into the theatre not knowing the title and not seeing the trailer. It started off with cheesy lines and continued immensely using 90s catch phrases. The script was terrible and nothing felt realistic. One of the main characters who played the princess was such a terrible actress. I couldn't even count how many time I rolled my eyes because this movie did not appeal to me at all. There were some comedic parts but other than that it was bad.

Reviews on the Internet weren't always convincing: the actors would be bad, the editing was horrible and the movie wouldn't be as good as the book (but when exactly is the movie better?). One way or another, I walked into the cinema and decided to watch it, even with low expectations.The movie started pretty good. I was immediately caught up and couldn't look away anymore. As for my friend I had brought with me: she hadn't read the book and yet, she enjoyed the beginning. For the rest of the movie: it wasn't always good or perfect but it was fine, so good enough.I also think the casting was pretty good. Zoey Deutch did an amazing job and I now can't picture anyone else for the role. The only thing that bothered me in the beginning was Lucy Fry's accent but after several minutes, that was completely gone.Considering all things, I believe this was a good adaption of Richelle Mead's book and I even recommend it to people who haven't read the book.",Vampire Academy

Rose was supposed to be beautiful, curvy, Turkish decent, sassy. This movie made here seem weak and in the books she was not weak. Lissa was supposed to be charismatic and lovable/likable. The actress didn't pull that off. Dimitri was supposed to be a Godlike guardian that liked to read western novels. Missed the mark there. Bad movie makers bad naughty shame on you They suck at school and you suck at movies. ---Le sigh",Vampire Academy
182,reynapryde,It was what I expected,10,7 February 2014,"My thoughts were that Vampire Academy was pretty great. As a fan of the book, I would have liked to know what the movie experience would have been without the knowledge I have. Almost all the scenes were there, just a little different like 'where' they happened. They increased the action which kept it interesting. The humor was good, but a little over the top and they could have toned it down a bit to make the movie amazing. I did have some trouble with understanding what was said at times. Many have said it was the accents, I think it was the dialog being rushed. There were several times where I wished I had a remote to stop it and replay it just to hear it again. Overall, it was what I expected and my hubby laughed more than I did! Vampire Academy gets better with each book in the series and the first movie was well done, so heres to seeing some amazing movies in the future!",Vampire Academy
183,lori-918-6014,Exposition from a VA Series Reader whose not a YA,9,7 February 2014,"I have read all of the VA series and enjoyed them immensely, mainly because of Rose. Rose Hathaway is feisty, determined, funny, and flawed, and it was always fun to see what she would do next and how that would land her in trouble. This story is not your ""typical vampire"" story. Everyone in the story already knows about vampires and the makeup of the society they live in. Nor is it a damsel in distress story. Rose already possesses strength and determination, although she does have impulse control issues. She is best friends with the vampire princess, Lissa Dragomir who is the last of her line, and extremely loyal and protective of her.The movie and books have been compared to many other YA/vampire genre, but the story does not follow Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey outline. Both Star Wars and Harry Potter did excellent jobs capturing the hero's journey, and the Twilight series followed Carl Jung's development of the soul and the anima/animus well. Mead does not use either of these outlines/archetypes in her books, and her storytelling provides a freshness, as well as giving a portrayal of strong women who look out for each other.Perhaps, the story could be compared to ""Thelma and Louise"" navigate a dysfunctional high school that just happens to have vampires and magic.Now for the movie itself: the tone and pacing of the movie are very much Rose and are true to the tone and pacing of the books. I actually liked the new scenes that were added to the movie – they did not distract in ways that other book-to-movies have done, but actually enhanced the story. I think the movie represented all the dynamics of the various relationships well, although I do wish the Rose/Dimitri relationship had been better developed. There wasn't the tension between them that there was in the books. And although I wish I could have forgotten the story (and the previews) during the movie so that I could have enjoyed the movie without all that knowledge, I did find myself getting lost in the movie.Of all the first time movies of various popular YA book-to-movie adaptations that I have read and seen, I think this movie was one of the better ones that has been done.",Vampire Academy
184,larissajohnson,This movie fits the marketing theme of 'they suck' because it did.,1,7 February 2014,"I didn't have high hopes walking into this film. I've been pretty adamant about not seeing it due to the blatant whitewashing of the lead character, but my little sister begged me to take her today, so I did.Biggest mistake of my life.It was horrible. There were 7 of us in the theater, and no one laughed, not one time. A girl who was about eighteen made a gagging noise before she got up and walked out muttering about it being complete crap, but that hardly counts as a laugh.I have to wonder if the other reviewers who praise Deutch's performance saw the same movie I did. She was wooden,her pacing and delivery were dismal and half the time her expression was one that made me think she needed to find a restroom. I predict she is about to be labeled box office poison and it is a title she deserves.My little sister was actually in tears halfway through the movie and asked me if we could leave. This was her favorite series, and mine too, and it was absolutely butchered beyond belief.",Vampire Academy
185,lozzabr,It converted my mother. O;,10,19 March 2014,"I took my mother to see VA, after I had seen it myself to enjoy the full impact of Dimitri offcourse(AND OMG!), afterwords I did what all die hard fans do; I asked if she liked it, a lot. My mother, who is to my shock horror not a reader or a fan of ""the supernatural"", said it was good (Obviously sending me into a blind rage). However once I'd made my dramatic entrance into my room, flouncing onto my bed in a fit of rage, my mother opens the recently slammed door, I know the audacity of her, and ask what the sequel to VA is. After telling her, so as to remain a loyal member to my fandom, she asks for the book. SHE ASKS FOR THE BOOK. THE BOOK. 5 days later Richelle Mead has done what I thought none could, but then again it is Richelle Mead people, and my mother is currently on the 4 book of the series and going strong. Now Richelle Meads brilliance is undoubtedly a main factor, after all she started it all, however to relate this review I would like to congratulate The Vampire Academy cast and crew for making such a good movie, because not only have I found it enjoyable but you have made someone want to actually continue the story, a great fete for any book to movie translation. However now I have a mother obsessed with Frostbite the movie release date, so please do me a favor and make sure you have one!",Vampire Academy
186,meowmeower1037,A True Disappointment,1,7 February 2014,"Initially when hearing that the book ""Vampire Academy"" by Richelle Mead was going to be put into a motion picture I was ecstatic! Mead's books create such an interesting world with captivating characters and adventures that have you picking up the next edition the second you finished the preceding one. The movie did not capture the books' unique world or characters.What replaced my initial excitement for the movie was disappointment almost immediately after the movie started. The casting/acting, script, and quality were all unbearably embarrassing because they failed to reach past a superficial level. The creators of this film overdid the lame cheesy jokes (executed by less-than-satisfactory acting), and didn't illustrate any seriousness within vital characters like Rose and Lissa as in the book. Luckily, the movie did follow the plot well, but this single positive is overshadowed by the fact that the events felt strung together to reach a ""climax"" which was not supported from rising events within the movie.Overall, the production did not live up to the high expectations I had held and was a sad disappointment for a VA fan like myself.",Vampire Academy
187,Live_027,Vampire Academy,10,8 February 2014,"Like every other fan, sometimes you get afraid that they may mess up the movie, or to get to the point where you say 'The Book was better'. Vampire Academy like any other book, made into a movie will have some changes, everything can't be exactly like the books but thrust me If you read the books and you love the series you will love the movie!!In my personal opinion it was Amazing!!Yeah like I said they made some little changes but they wont affect you at all, it actually make the movie more interesting and seriously I came out of the movie theater with my mind blowing. It was a MILLION times better of what I expected. I love the characters all of them were fantastic, the cast is amazing, so if you still a little scared or insecure about the cast, forget about it. I love the chemistry between Lisa and Christian, as well as Rose and Dimitri. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. If you are not a fan at all, I would say....give the movie a chance I promised you won't regret it. And instead you will find a movie, full of humor, action and a totally new concept of Vampires.",Vampire Academy
188,ajmccolley2,Was OK!,8,7 February 2014,"Had high hopes for this movie but knew it was going to be less serious when I saw it was done by the same people who did Mean Girls. I liked the character choices for Rose, Lissa & Christian. Wasn't a fan of the way they portrayed Dmitri though, the actor who plays him is crazy handsome but I didn't find him desirable in the movie at all. Also wanted Rose to be a little more rugged and tough, she was way too pretty and preppy for what I expected. The ending has me hopeful for the second film but I hope they make it more ""adult""-like instead of how teeny-bopper it felt. Another film that doesn't meet book expectations but willing to give them another chance for the second one! Please make it more serious!",Vampire Academy
189,hjbrat16-918-691134,Everyone's a Critic,10,8 February 2014,"I have read the books. I love Richelle Mead's books-and when I say this, I mean it. I have read every one of her books (I STILL can't believe Georgina Kincaid doesn't have her own show yet!). However, placing my love for her as an author aside, I went to see the movie with the notion that it would be terrible and cheesy (you saw the main trailer right?!). It was nothing like what was in the trailer. It was snarky, spunky and over all a good film.HOWEVER- I'm sure you've read otherwise. I've seen the critic's reviews. I've read about how terrible (very few) people thought it was. Let me explain it a little. They have NO idea what they're talking about! (okay, that's my opinion and I don't mean to invalidate any one else's but c'mon, it's awesome!) As far as visual affects go, it's about as bad as any lower budget film. Seriously does anyone REMEMBER the first Harry Potter? Look at the last one-total difference. Budgeting can change a film completely. Which is Exactly what we will see happen when this series really takes off. If you haven't read the books, I strongly recommend talking to someone who has, they can explain things you may have missed or don't quite understand. I don't think that is a flaw in the movie either. We see films that aren't adaptations from novels and miss things, or don't have any clue what really happened until we watch it again (maybe twice?). Who hasn't watch a film again and said 'OH! I get it now'. To wrap this up I'd like to say that this movie is done really well.NO it does not EXACTLY follow every sentence in the book, but they've summarized and portrayed elements that were probably really difficult to write/act/direct. I also take comfort in the fact that the next books just get better! And I imagine that over time, the movies will get larger and larger budgets, and will get new writers and more production staff (in addition to the current ones, not replacing) in order to create the world in it's entirety for the movie audiences. It was a great film- don't knock it till you try it, at least that's what momma says ;)",Vampire Academy
190,hrkoon98,As a Fan,9,8 February 2014,"As a fan of the original VA movie, I was pulled in simply because I loved the books and I wanted to see if the movie lived up to my expectations. It didn't. It surpassed my expectations! Zoey Deutch, Lucy Fry, Dominic Sherwood, and Danila Kozlovsky were phenomenal in their roles as Rose, Lissa, Christian, and Dimitri. I was skeptical at first because of how fast-paced it was, but I can also understand that they needed to get in all the basic information of the Moroi, Dhampir, and Strigoi.And it was amazing! The action just kept rolling throughout the entire movie, it really grasped your attention and at one point when I glanced at my phone's clock, and entire HOUR had already passed. And so unlike other YA movie adaptations, this movie was really centered more around Lissa and Rose's friendship then anything else. Of course, there were scenes that promoted the love interests of the two girls, but it was really more about them, and protecting the other. And I absolutely loved that my favorite thing about the books was also exhibited in the movie.You will not regret seeing this movie. My best friend, who hadn't read the books, was 100% skeptical about it, but the minute that all the action began and the mystery of what was going on. She was enthralled just like I was, sitting on the edge of her seat. And I was so happy to be able to see the reaction of a non-fan. To know that the movie was directed and written so well by the Waters brothers that they accomplished their goal of pulling in non-fans. It really gives me hope and faith that the sequels can be made.And I know a lot of people think this movie will be bad because it's in high school, but it's really only the first book that is like that. The sequels really pull out the drama, the romance, and the angst. More serious emotions that every age-group can relate to. And that is what is so great about this series, almost anyone can find something to relate to. Whether a character, or the scenarios that are played out. And it's genuinely funny! Humor, action, and drama. You have to like one of those at least! This movie was so great, and it really kept a lot of the scenes from the books which I loved! To know that Mark Waters didn't cut out scenes that he knew were important to the fans, but he also put in knew scenes that non-fans could appreciate as well, that's admirable. And I really hope that everyone who has the chance or has acknowledged this movie in the slightest will go and see it. It really is phenomenal and it'll be worth the money and the 1 hour and 44 minutes of your life.",Vampire Academy
191,basts,Read and Watch :),8,8 February 2014,"VAMPIRE ACADEMY the movie - Pro movie reviewers bash what they have no clue about. Clearly professional movie reviewers were all expecting Twilight/Heathers/Mean Girls and are panning the movie because this movie is nothing like those stories.First, as readers of the books know, Vampire Academy is nothing like Twilight, and unfortunately, many so called pro reviewers obviously know nothing about the books this story is based on. While it is not a hugely budgeted eye candy like Twilight Movies, it had a much better plot that is overlooked by clearly blinkered reviewers hoping for mean girls or heathers instead of checking into the movie's actual origins which is a very good book series that the movie is staying pretty faithful too despite the mean girls/heathers dark comedy glossing the production end is trying to overlay the series with.What pro reviewers are completely missing is that this story is about friendship and loyalty between two girls of different origins and expected life paths, and what they are willing to do to help and protect each other while trying to become strong, good people.It wasn't the best rendition of the first book, but it wasn't the total drag reviewers portrays it. I took a male friend to Friday night's showing and while he'd never read the books, he agreed it was much better than we'd been expecting from the commercial trailers and I got him interested in the book series. yay! The movie had the feel of a television pilot more than that of a theatrical release. And while visuals were decent by television level standards I was disappointed that it wasn't a bit more sophisticated. It seemed it was shot on a very low budget, however it stayed pretty faithful to the story line. The pacing seemed pretty rushed, I think this would have worked better with a slower pace, a better music score, and more focus on the mystery/intrigue aspects, as well as the shared fear Lissa and Rose have about Lissa's mental health because in the books they are very concerned that Lissa may be falling to madness the way previous Spirit oriented vampires have.The Vampire Academy story line from the books are about strong characters, who happen to be teenage girls, trying to deal with futures and responsibilities not just imposed on them by their culture and circumstances, but those they choose for themselves as well. I think the books are pretty awesome, and hope there are more movies so more of the books story line will be brought to cinematic life.I recommend reading the books (or the first one at least) and then watching the movie",Vampire Academy

She has never read the books, so she had NO IDEA about what she was going to watch. ""I'm happy to have met Rose and I'm happy to have discovered this new world. But I want more now'', that's one of the many positive words she said about Vampire Academy. SHE DID NOT READ THE BOOKS BUT NOW SHE'S A FAN BECAUSE OF THE MOVIE. Now I don't care if the critics weren't invited to the 1st screening and that's for sure the reason why they are spending so many rude and inappropriate comments, but PEOPLE ARE LOVING IT.

194,nrdpura,Movie Review from Must Read Before You Die,6,9 February 2014,"Saw VAMPIRE ACADEMY last night!! So awesome that Richelle Mead's work is on the big screen! By the end of it though, I had slim hopes that this is going to make it into all 6 movies if they do one book per movie. Yeah, I guess vampires are in right now and while Vampire Academy was such a great read, I don't see how people who haven't read the books are going to see if for the awesomeness that it is.Everything was jammed pack. My bf who hadn't read the books said it felt like things were going way too fast. There were a lot of things they were trying to fit in there and he could tell many things were probably lost in the movie that happened in the book. It's been a couple of years since I read the first book and there were things happening in the movie where I just wondered, How did they come up with that? I was disappointed that Rose wasn't as bad ass in the fighting department but I'm probably remembering the Rose she turns out to be :) Overall, I do like the actresses who played Rose and Lisa. Rose is hot and she does look like she can kick some ass... eventually. Lisa is cute and sweet.What I didn't like is Danila Kozlovsky who played Dimitri. I wish he didn't look so old and wanted him to have a muscular slim frame. But the worst is his face - just not attractive to me at all.. whhhyyyyyy did this happen?!?! So I looked up Danila online for more pics of him and he's got some good looking pics out there! Why didn't he look like THAT in the movie?! I hope if there's a second movie, they do something with his hair to bring out his hotness.Now Dominic Sherwood as Christian - hubba hubba! That's what I'm talking about people!! :) :) :) I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It made me laugh and I loved seeing this set of literary characters on the big screen. I hope there is enough interest in it from the public to make it into 5 more movies. Very cool that lots of my favorite books are coming out soon. I saw a preview for The Fault in Our Stars and will definitely be watching that one. Also looking forward to Divergent!",Vampire Academy

It is a very good adaption. It's a funny and amusing and has interactions that everyone can relate to. It on the stresses importance of friendship and has a strong and funny female character that is very lovable because she is strong and independent and very different form most main female characters in movies.It is better then Twilight and its is a fresh fun take on vampires. The story is a good one and it only gets better. It over all is a GREAT movie and a MUST see. Take a group of close friends and enjoy this EPIC movie. Its very much worth it!

I did have things about the movie I did not enjoy. My main issue was how rushed it felt, I really think an extra 15 minutes to give a little more time for scenes to play out and relationships to be understood would have been good. If you haven't watched, STOP READING. There are SPOILERS from here on out. I think that the way they showed the compulsion was a little cheesy and they could have pulled it off better. I also wish Mia's character wasn't so blatantly desperate to popular. I think the best example is the dance scene when she comes up to Lissa and her hissy fang fit bugged me. Overall though, I enjoyed the movie and hope they make Frostbite.",Vampire Academy

Why not listen to people that have gone to see the movie and have loved it, and can give you real reviews of the movie. Here's why you should go see this movie: IT'S FUN. This movie, yes it's a movie about two best friends from high school and yes they deal with regular high school drama and bullying. But's its also has that strong friendship between the two best friends, Rose and Lissa, that everyone will admire. For those who love a supernatural twist, that's there. Rose is Lissa's half vampire, half human guardian who will protect her at all cost. Lissa is from a race of peaceful mortal vampires, that need protection from the undead, unmoral vampires that will kill anything to survive. There's lots of action fight scenes that many will love, and there's some romance, but it doesn't overshadow the main friendship between Rose and Lissa.

But the acting and casting was phenomenal. They could not have picked a better Rose, Lissa, Dimitri, or Christian. The bad critic reviews are so disheartening because they honestly don't know what they're talking about. I guarantee you the majority of them have not read the books.

202,icecreamcone2317,vampire academy is amazing!,10,10 February 2014,"I loved this movie. This is not a movie for everyone. Everyone likes different things. I'm not going to try and make everyone love this movie as much as me. But, you should give it a try. Try to not watch it with low expectations because then that's what you will get. Just like in life. Trashing movies is just pathetic. Comparing movies as a "" professional "" critic negatively is just disappointing. Vampire Academy is nothing like twilight. While both are great films and essentially have ""vampires"". They are nothing alike. Twilight is a wonderful love story and about a women finding herself. Vampire Academy is about friendship and an independent women who knows who she is and what she wants to be, a protector and fighter. The vampires in twilight are immortal, can just drink animal blood, and sparkles in the sun. Vampire Academy has three different unique types of vampires. Moroi who dislike the sun and are bothered from it. They have specific magic, are not immortal, drink blood from willing humans. Dhampirs who are half vampire and half human. They do not drink blood, are not immortal, don't drink blood and eat whatever they want. They are born with the natural instincts to fight. They protect the moroi from the third vampires the strogoi who are the stereotypical vampires. They are soulless, immortal beasts who kill for blood, and cannot go in the sunlight and are killed my a stake in the heart. If you are moroi and kill a human while feeding you become a strogoi. Otherwise you are turned by force. I could go on and on. Although Harry Potter is wonderful, this movie is even less then anything like Harry Potter. Yes, there is magic, but nothing at all like Harry Potter. Only moroi have magic. And there magic is only one of the 4 elements. Earth, fire, water, air. They each only specialize in one. Spirit is a special exception. That takes more time to explain. This movie is not based mainly on the magic. It's just something they get like anything (like puberty). I'm fine if you don't love the movie like I do. But, it is exhausting hearing some people say it's a twilight meets harry potter in a very negative way. It's like saying sideman and batman are the exact same just because they both have superheroes. This in my opinion is an amazing film. I have watched it 7 times already. The author of the book, Richelle Mead, put a lot of effort in this story. She actually researched the ideas of stories about theses specific vampires. She is amazing and very talented. Mark Waters and the rest of team did a wonderful job bringing the book to life and making an amazing movie. They added and changed minor details, but kept the story true. The amazing actors/actresses who were in this movie brought the characters and the chemistry to life. This is about two best friends who just happen to be vampires. They go through many relatable things in life, just like us. There is humor, romance, action, and much more. This isn't intended to be the next Oscar movie, it's for fun! :) Be open-minded and give it a try! :D",Vampire Academy

This movie really tested my ability to not walk out. The two largest issues for me were the casting and the poor acting but the special effects, like the dogs, were just poorly done. Ahh...Demetriwhat a let down! The worst casting of all!!! Some of the characters didn't even match their descriptions in the book! I was quite disappointed that the movie did not start at the beginning of the story and was narrated quite a bit in the beginning. It seemed to me to be a low budget film. That's really too bad because the book series is quite an awesome page turner!

But for those who are needing a YA series to follow, get on the frickin' bandwagon because this movie is FANTASTIC! As a reader and devout fan of the books, I was terrified that the movie would ruin the books for me. Though still excited, Hollywood hasn't exactly produced a lot of books-to-movie that stayed true to the novels themselves and all in all failed to pull in new fans. The Marks brothers, however, did AMAZING! To begin with, I loved ALL the character choices. Lissa, Mason and Mia were spot on, Rose and Dimitri were FLAWLESS together (chemistry is off the charts) but the person I was the most surprised by was Christian. I'm not saying I loved him more then Rose and Dimitri, but everyone's going on and on about them and I feel like Christian was just as important of a character and was portrayed extremely well.The story was great and was very entertaining. The witty quips combined with a nice amount of drama kept me hungry for more during the entire film and I left with a desire to see it again immediately! Yes, there is a cheesiness factor and yes, there is some acting that makes you raise your eyebrows but really... come on. It's a teen movie. Get over it.

I re-read the books in anticipation of the Movie and fell in love with Rose and Dimitris story all over again. My husband took me to see the movie on Saturday and it was okay. They stayed pretty true to the books and I understand that they can't fit an entire book into 2 hrs but by the end of the movie I felt like, if I didn't already know these characters, I still wouldn't. Rose and Lissa's relationship didn't show very well. I know they wanted fresh new face to start a series but they seemed kind of unattached. And Dimitri...(sigh). I was expecting to not only think he was the hottest man alive but to fall a little in love with him and I didn't. I just didn't see their chemistry. I did like the movie though, I'm hoping that they will finish the series because they really do get better, and I'm hoping that I like Dimitri more as their story progresses. If they do this successfully, it could work out like Twilight, in which we all know the other guy is hotter (Jacob), but we are still rooting for the soul mates. I don't want to finish these movies and wish she stayed with Adrian!",Vampire Academy
206,chardonaytje,awesome!,10,13 February 2014,"Just saw the movie in The Netherlands, and loved it! They really stayed true to the book.( I was afraid they wouldn't after i saw a couple trailers and stills. ) But they were a few moments when i thought, its a bit to girlie compared to the books, but that didn't changed my view of the movie at all, cause it was fun to watch! I even had my doubts about the actors, i was afraid they choose the wrong persons for this movie, but they really did a great job! And i thought the fight scenes were done amazing, and the other special effects were done good! I loved it and cant wait for Frostbite!P.S. This movie doesn't look like Twillight at all! Its not creepy, its not boring, it is an original story and really fun. to see! I would advice people to just see it!",Vampire Academy
207,shadowfate-924-98003,Excellent Adaptation of an Excellent Book,10,15 February 2014,"I've been a fan of the book series since it was first published. Critics aren't too impressed with the movie version but I think its time they heard what the fans have to say. It was good. It was beyond good; it was FANTASTIC. Book readers are often the harshest critics amongst fans; worries about whether scenes will be cut or whether the actors fit the characters they're supposed to play. But I'm glad to say, going to watch the movie with an open mind and faith in Richelle Mead & the crew, I was impressed. Is it ever going to win an Oscar? No. But then, what teenage-centric movie has? Harry Potter was one of my favourite movies and as epic as it was it wasn't even considered for the Oscars. So it isn't fair to put VA down just because it will never make it into the Oscars. I actually liked the changes made in the movie. The script writer and director made excellent choices that clearly conveyed what was going on that would have been difficult to be shown in the movie. Considering that the crew of VA were dealing with adapting hundreds of pages into a movie that ran under 2 hours, they did an excellent job. I particularly liked the fight scene that occurred just as soon the guardians took Rose and Lissa back to the academy. Now that never happened in the book but I loved it. It was fast and unexpected and set the pace for the rest of the movie that while it may have elements of a chick flick, it's also an action movie and people die. Brutally. The fight scenes were real and fast and hard and were choreographed and performed to perfection. Let's face it. Us fans have been waiting with bated breath not only for the movie to finally be a reality, but also for the lust scene. And let me tell you: every girl and even guy in the cinema squealed and swooned when the scene came on. It was admittedly shorter than in the book but it was effective and got the point across. In fact, every scene between Rose and Dimitri, such as the one where he pins her down on the gym floor or the one where he tells her to keep her hair up, crackles with so much electricity and sexual tension I was surprised the air around them didn't just combust. The Lissa/Christian relationship, while somewhat more subdued than the Rose/Dimitri one, still sparked with chemistry and I definitely look forward to seeing it grow. The script was witty and sharp and so darn funny! The audience definitely enjoyed Rose's dry-wit and sarcasm which found a partner in Christian's own snark. The entire cast worked well to bring some levity into the movie, even Headmistress Kirova participated. Well, somewhat. Her ""I could have been a model"" rant after Rose stuck the tranquilliser into her resulted in peals of laughter. So yeah, one of the highlights was definitely the quality of the script which not only manages to bring out the comedic undertones of the movie, but also produce stirring speeches like the one Lissa delivers at the end. The cast was stellar and I was glad no one extremely famous was cast as the main characters, with the exception of the older cast who brought suitable dignity to their characters. Russian Danila Kozlovsky as Dimitri was swoon worthy, his Dimitri extremely believable as the god he's constantly described as. The bare hint of his Russian accent was perfect and believable, exactly what the producers and director wanted, and what we fans looked for. And whoever said that Zoey Deutch was too scrawny to play Rose better eat their words; that girl may be slim and smaller in stature than what people may have imagined, but she kicks major ass. Lucy Fry was elegant and poised as Lissa, even giving her that extra fire and spice that no one thought she was capable of. Dominic Sherwood lent more vulnerability to Christian Ozera while Sami Gayle was the conniving bitch everyone had imagined Mia to be. Cameron Monaghan was great as Mason, but I hope that if, WHEN VA gets picked up for ""Frostbite"", his role gets fleshed out a little more. Olga Kurylenko and Joely Richardson were believable as the two matriarchs who clearly disliked Rose and Lissa. Perhaps a standout performance was that of Sarah Hyland who played meek, geeky and clumsy Natalie Dashkov to perfection. Her innocence fooled everyone and even I, who knew the entire story, had a difficult time believing that she had been harbouring such a dark side, coaxed by her fear of social isolation and egged on by her desperate father, Viktor Dashkov (Gabriel Byrne) who once again fooled everyone with his weak, fatherly appearance. Perhaps one of the best compliments that could be given to Vampire Academy, is that you don't feel like you're watching a vampire movie, like Twilight. The vampire element, while clearly the core and soul of the movie, isn't overplayed and sometimes you think you're just watching teenagers try to survive high school and all its problems that I'm sure we could all relate to. Except for the fact that sometimes it's life and death, and that they're vampires. While I respect what the critics have to say, I think they're far too harsh. Saying this movie is a lazy blend of Harry Potter and Twilight is unfair; Vampire Academy is extremely different from those two movies. The characters, what they fight for, the usage of the Romanian legends of Moroi and Strigoi are what make this movie what it is. The students of St. Vlad's may suck at school, but they definitely don't suck at all.",Vampire Academy
208,nmmenchio,Better Than Expected,10,15 February 2014,"As this is the most recent movie I have seen, I'm doing my first review on it.For myself, 99 percent of the time a book or book series is made into a film, the book is considered much better. I read the book months ago, and I was quite impressed with this film.Although many people felt as if it was rushed, I don't feel that way. I believe that the progression was very well timed; not too fast and not too slow. My attention was held throughout the entire film. I know another thing that people seemed to dislike was the Moroi being able to use magic. I loved it. They used it in the book, it would be stupid to not use it in the film as well. I thought it added a really good twist. Now on to the characters.I feel as if all of the characters were very well played. Focusing on four of the main characters of Rose, Lissa, Dimitri and Christian, here is what I have to say.Zoey Deutch without a doubt made the perfect Rose Hathaway. She was feisty and very outgoing, but she did have her times where you could see that she was vulnerable and times where she was very compassionate.Lucy Fry as Lissa was amazing as well. I feel as if her caring personality really came out. The way she acted and carried herself was nothing short of perfect.The same goes for Dominic Sherwood. Although Christian has his fairly violent and angry side, he also has an extremely caring side to himself. I feel that Dominic did a great job of portraying both of those.Lastly, Danila Kozlovsky. I have seen numerous people complaining about him being chosen for the part of Dimitri. I however feel that he fit the role better than I ever thought he would. He had the tough exterior with the very kind, compassionate and caring personality. The fact that he is Russian as well really helped define his character as he is Russian in the book. Honestly, I fell in love with his character.Overall, I felt that this movie didn't get a lot of the credit or recognition that it deserved. I would go see it again in a heartbeat, and enroll in St. Vladimir's if it really existed.Too good to not have a sequel.",Vampire Academy
209,rosemariesgroi,If you've read the book you will hate the movie!,3,16 February 2014,"This is the first time i have written a review, I usually just read them but i was so shocked by all these good reviews i had to. I read the whole series and LOVED the books.With that being said, the movie sucked, it was just such bad acting. I was most disappointed in Rose Hathaway. I loved her in the book, and the movie just did not do her justice. In the book she was a bad ass and serious about being a protector to Lisa, while also having that smart ass personality, this is not how they portray her in the movie. All these good reviews must be from people who did not read the book. I don't think we will be seeing the rest of the vampire academy books on film.",Vampire Academy
210,MissEmilyReagan,Vampire Academy,10,18 February 2014,"I became a huge fan of the books about 4 years ago and have been waiting for this movie ever since! It lived up to all my expectations! 5 out of 5/ 10 out of 10 for me! As for it being accurate to the books I'd give it a 8 out of 10. This is a situation where it's a good movie/story with a really bad name! Don't let it fool you. If you're a fan of smart-ass humor this is right up your alley! It's got brilliant lead females who can hold their own, which is what sets it apart from say, I don't know, TWILIGHT! There is definitely more to this movie than the awful trailers and somewhat cheesy poster. As a fan who would like a sequel I say, please go see the movie. If anything it'll make you laugh!",Vampire Academy
211,GoFrogUrself,Finally a book adaptation that follows the path set by the book!,10,26 February 2014,"Comparing Vampire Academy to Harry Potter and Twilight are not doing this movie justice. Yes, this first book takes place almost entirely on the campus of a school where some magic is performed but these aren't prepubescent witches and wizards, and there are no glittering vampires to be seen. This movie deals with life and death in a very witty way. Readers of the book go in knowing just what to expect but fans of screen writer Daniel Waters should also enjoy the witty dialogue that is reminiscent of ""Heathers"" and director brother Mark, has brought a style similar to his direction ""Mean Girls"". I encourage you to keep an open mind and go see this great movie. There are six books in total and all should get the movie treatment to allow women everywhere the joy of seeing Dimitri Belikov come to life.",Vampire Academy
212,raechel-carlsen,Loved the books - Hated the movie,1,19 March 2014,"I have read every book from the VA series many times over and I absolutely love them - love the story, the characters and everything in between. After seeing the trailer for Vampire Academy I already knew it was going to be terrible, but I went and saw it anyway - I'm such a huge fan of the books, I had to go see the movie. I went with my Best Friend and we both have the same opinion of the film. Hands down, the worst book to movie adaptation I have ever seen.. And I have seen a lot. I'll start by saying that even before I saw the film I wasn't happy with the casting choices they made. And I'll tell you why. Rose Hathaway is meant to be this bad ass curvy, voluptuous girl with dark tanned skin (from her Turkish father, remember?) and dead straight, long, almost jet black hair. What they made her was this skinny, pale, curly haired stick with no curves, no tan and no straight hair. Not to mention you could tell they had to purposely make the actors boobs look bigger by putting her in push up bras. I also don't think Zoey Deutch did a good enough job playing Rose. Don't get me wrong, she's a good actor and as her own character she was great - but not as Rose Hathaway. She wasn't nearly as Sassy enough, not the slightest bit seductive/flirtatious enough and her whole character was built on snarky comments (and yes, I realise that Rose is that kind of character - but that is not all she is. She has substance. And Rose Hathaway in the film, did not). And their decision for Dimitri? COME ON! He was no Dimitri Belikov. Danila Kozlovski did an alright job with the script he was given, he had Dimitri's sneaky smirk down to a T! But he is not a 'god' like Dimitri is so often described as in the books. His fight scenes were all so obviously fake and they weren't convincing. I said it before and I'll say it again.. Worst book to movie adaptation ever. Who ever wrote the script for the film clearly loves their soap operas because this is exactly what the film felt like to me. It actually felt like they were mocking the book. They made it all about cheap jokes and cheesy one liners and the book is WAY more than that. They focused solely on the comedic side that the rest of it literally looked like a satire. Not to mention they added so much crap in that wasn't in the book and they left out so much from the book that really needed to be in the film. For instance, the development of feelings between Rose and Dimitri - BARELY touched on in the film. Rose & Dimitri don't just fall in love at first sight.. They have weeks of training sessions, of getting to know each other before they realise they love each other. In the film, however, they have a few suggestive comments, a couple of training sessions and at the end of the film they are confessing their love for one another. I was kind of like 'um.. when did that happen?' Another crucial focus in the book is Lissa's Spirit driving her insane.. Which they kind of touched on but not really and definitely not enough. They also decided to add a random scene where Rose tells Headmistress Kirova and other faculty members about Lissa's Spirit.. As far as I remember, in the book, Rose does everything to prevent them from finding out... They also made a HUGE mistake when they decided to add a Strigoi attack at the very beginning of the film just outside the gate at St Vlad's.. hmm, last I checked the wards surrounding the Academy stretched much farther out then the gate line. But who am I to say, I could be mistaken.. I've only read the book say at least 5 times! (not even an over exaggeration). Another scene they decided to ruin was the lust charm scene, which lasted all of 15 seconds. In the book, Dimitri sees the 'decision' in Rose's eyes and removes her necklace as it's the last item of 'clothing' she's wearing, then and only then do they realise what the necklace was.. In the film, however, Dimitri somehow knows exactly what the necklace is and rips it from her neck violently. Also, Christian doesn't get shredded to pieces by the PSI hounds.. He gets shot. By Victor Dashkov. Yep. That actually happened. Or, didn't happen. One final point I will make, is that I know how difficult it is to make a good movie adaptation from a book.. There is way too much in a book that just can't fit in to a movie. But I feel like there could have been much better decisions made regarding Vampire Academy to make it a much better film. I even thought that as a movie on it's own, it was terrible. There was no real point to it - people watching it who haven't read the books would probably walk away going 'was that a mockery of all things Vampire?' Not to mention the film raced through the storyline as if there was no tomorrow. I have read some other reviews by other fans of the books and I have to say, I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that they thought it was a fantastic movie.. In my opinion, it most certainly was not. I would be shocked to my core if I heard Richelle Mead say she was proud of the movie and happy with the direction the director/writers/producers etc. took. This movie was not Vampire Academy. This movie was rubbish.",Vampire Academy

I created an account just to tell you exactly how terrible.Rose Hathaway is nothing like her character description. She was meant to be curvy, sultry, and tan. Rose in the movie was skinny, awkward, and pale.Dimitri Belikov is supposed to be attractive.The plot is incredibly rushed. I realize that it's hard to fit the book into one movie, but there is *no* need to take out important scenes while adding in pointless ones. Everything is incredibly tacky. It felt as if the viewer was being force fed way too much information at the beginning. The dialogue was way too cheesy. I started watching it with low expectations, but I still overestimated it. This is the worst film adaptation of a book I've ever seen. And yes, I have read and seen Eragon.",Vampire Academy

I would definitely recommend this to a friend and I certainly would watch it a couple of more times. You must be open to what the movie brings, if you are constantly comparing it to the books well, you won't like it.

Casts are really portraying their role based on the book characters and the story is not just focusing on the vampire world. Great chemistry of Zoey and Danila as Rose and Dimitri and Lucy is so perfect to be as Lissa. Not a typical vampire story sucking blood and enemy with the witches. This is a story that will let you ask for more. Though some scenes are deleted still Mark Waters highlighted the top events on the book! I hope the success of this movie will result on its 2nd Book - Frostbite. So far I have read all the Vampire Academy series and bloodlines and its really interesting since the story will not only focus on one love team. This is really F****** Awesome Movie!!!,Vampire Academy
218,sarah-5-713210,"Loved the Book, Hated the Movie",1,19 May 2014,"I am a big fan of the books and have read them all several times. The movie TRIED to go by the book and failed miserably. The acting was choppy and there were scenes added that weren't in the book. Like Headmistress Kirova wasn't all ""seductive"" in the book. The casting for Rose was good but could have been better. Rose was more than just quick one liners in the book. She had way more depth. Lissa was casted OK, not quite what I imagined, and I don't know what was up with her lips in the movie!! The casting for Dimitri? HORRIBLE! He was no where near the ""god"" the book described. The way Rose raved about his looks in the book left me very disappointed with the movie version of Dimitri.

Then my girlfriend talked me into taking her to see Breaking Dawn and honestly, that sucked just as bad as the first, actually it was worse. I honestly thought I wasn't going to like Vampire Academy since Twilight ruined my thoughts on any vampire films, but when my fiancé wanted to watch it, I decided to give it a try. Turns out, I actually liked it, and both of us can't wait to see the next installment. People hate this movie because unlike Twilight, Vampire Academy's main plot is not about vampire love and sparkly guys. It's about a bond that two friends share and over coming dangerous obstacles just to survive. There may be hints of love between some of the characters but it's not the story. Watch Twilight just the first one again then watch Vampire Academy and see which one sucks worse, many will choose Vampire Academy over stupid Twilight!!!!",Vampire Academy
220,liam-rearden762,two better love stories then twilight,10,11 June 2014,"The film is about a class based society of vampires - a higher class is Moroi - the Royals, middle class Moroi - non royals, lower middle class Dhampires and the evil rebels against the system Strigoi. Moroi and Dhampires are living representatives of the society they live and die just like human beings but have to feed on human blood to survive, while Strigoi are undead - classic vampires that live forever but have to feed on living vampires to survive. The story line revolves around society and politics witnessed through the eyes of Moroi and Dhampire students. Dhamphire's role within the society is to protect Moroi's from Strigoi at all cost. Moroi are classed as more superior genetically and more valuable being able to do magic and being able to produce offspring and continue the living vampire line. Dhampires are cross breeds of a Moroi and a human or a Moroi and a Dhampire. Preservation of Moroi genes is paramount for the society to survive. Dhampires are trained as guardians and they have little free choice in their lives as have to put Moroi wishes and needs first. The story is told by Rose (a Dhampire) who although is bound to be a guardian of a royal Moroi - Lisa , has made real friends with her. They have a very warm friendship, with sisters like bond. The story explores friendship, first love, loyalty and duty and is somewhat nostalgic and would certainly bring back memories to some of us. The complexity involved in the love story of two Dhampires Rose and Dimitri is very intense and very natural- the characters in the film seem to have a real chemistry and that what makes it really work in my opinion - there are a couple of moments of sexual tension between the two characters. Also the relationship between two Moroi's Lisa and Christian is very tender and sweet. It's so much better then twilight, it is a shame it was given such little credit. Because the actors speak with Russian accent for some reason some people automatically hate it saying that it grinds on their ears.

And I can say that the movie might not be the best one out there but the script really tried to stick to the book and where it couldn't it didn't harm the storyline greatly (well, except one particular scene in the end).The cast was done nicely. I wasn't from the people that said ""we should have him and him and her"" because the book for me really created the people with both their personalities and appearances in my head. Yet the cast didn't really disappoint me, as some claim it sucked. Most actors look similarly to their characters and managed to express the personalities they had to. And, well, to all the girls that complained about how Danilla (Dimitri) didn't talk with the ""unholy-sexy British accent"", he's a Russian (both character and actor). And Russians talk like Russians... Duh.The script... Ah, in really tried to keep up to the book and failed at some points but in the same time it managed to tell the whole story in hour and a half. They added some more action, as the first book is more of a introduction than action-filled storyline. In the end we got a script a bit above the average and it was pretty enjoyable.Now, what really saddened me here - advertising. The trailers weren't around for too long and were almost non-existent in many countries the movie was supposed to appear in. And then it didn't even come out in many countries, even UK. And that really did bad to the box-office and made the down-fall of the production.",Vampire Academy

232,sandyphy17,I do not recommend,1,17 December 2014,"I really don't like this movie its like nearly two hours of tired tropes and poor writing, coupled with all around poor performances specially Zoey Deutch(Dhampir) & Lucy Fry (Moroi). They both even not looks hot & not acted well.I didn't feel any connection to the characters. Everything felt like plastic (specially Zoey Deutch; don't have ability to carry responsibility of such role. oh girl either change your profession or audience will kick you out), everyone's face was constantly caked with make-up.just like waste of money & time. The concept isn't good. its so bad as it can. All of the special effects through the film were just poor, and were not nice to look at.I do not recommend.its boring and hopeless movie.oh my god why their is minimum 1 if any chance then i can marked this as in minus vote.",Vampire Academy
233,jpmmw1998,"Gem of a Movie, I hope they continue to make more.",10,9 February 2014,"Too many people have prejudged this movie by it's trailer alone. It's too bad. They've judged the books by the trailer, much like others judge books by their cover,... and If I did the same, I'd never have pulled this book off the shelf in the first place. But this movie is a gem. The movie is fast paced, action filled, and funny. It follows the book faithfully and the same humor, character development, and tongue in cheek irreverence that has made this book series so popular are what makes the movie so fun to watch. I have two teen daughters and they loved this movie so much, they've seen it three times, three days in a row, each day bringing a new set of friends, and all of them (both teen boys and girls) enjoyed it. None of those friends had previously read the book. On the other hand, my two daughters both read the book and had high expectations and they were not disappointed. Rose is perfectly cast, and although I had my reservations on the casting of Lyssa, the actress casted does have the light hearted, slightly fragile, sweet personality that I would have expected from the character. Dmitri is also perfect for the role. (spoiler alert) The teen audience thought the relationship strange and a little bit disturbing (thank goodness!) but I did too when I first read about the developing relationship between a student and her mentor. But as the characters mature and the story evolves, the relationship makes more sense as the mentor-student dynamic dissolves with age and graduation. Mason is charming (as expected), Mia is as repulsive as one would expect, and Christian Ozera is more of a heart throb than the girls expected him to be, but is perfect in this brooding dark role (Robert Pattinson, you've got a strong competitor down to the twisted smile and perfect hair). In any case, I hope more people give this movie a chance as I'd love to see this cast assembled again for the rest of the series and see how they handle the more complicated plot twists, romantic tensions, heartbreak, and love triangles that are the hallmarks of the entire series.",Vampire Academy
234,therealrumena,A cringe worthy attempt to reboot Mean Girls with vampires,3,23 February 2015,"It's safe to say that many of those who have read the Vampire Academy series were looking forward to this movie. To be clear, I had low expectations when I walked into the theatre - the first book of the series was by far the worst, so the movie didn't really have much to go on in terms of success.The beginning of the movie is very fast paced. It's harsh to say that even the first two minutes (a flashback for Rose and Lissa's backstory) was very bland and downright painful to watch, but it's true. Once you get past that, you're suddenly caught in a present day situation where the dialog is very choppy and sets a quick pace. Before you know it, you end up meeting Kozlovsky's Dimitri, and get dragged back to the name sake of both the book and the movie (before it was called ""Blood Sisters""), the Vampire Academy.From this point onwards, you're forced from one situation to another, again giving a choppy feel. As someone of whom has read the book, when the producers, directors and even the author to the book said that the movie was true to said book, it's the truth, though it's a cut-and-paste situation. Situations that are taken from the book are placed into the movie, but are not done at all well and are often left unresolved.It was a great concept for a movie, but it was honestly not done at all well. A combination of better direction, casting choices (performances by Rory Fleck-Byrne, Claire Foy, Sami Gayle and Olga Kurylenko were all forced, bland and occasionally cringe-worthy) and a better use of the plots from the book could have saved this movie from the disaster that it was - also, had the directors not treated it as a Mean Girls reboot with vampires, it may have turned out much better.Honestly, they could have done with skipping the first book and gone straight with adapting the second - Frostbite would have made a much better movie.",Vampire Academy
235,katrinesseverinsen-42395,"probably the worst movie, right after Sharknado..",1,2 March 2015,"Sharknado was so bad, and i might think this is a runner up.First of all, this is like the vampire diaries f****d Twilight, and this is the result.. like what? After all the vampire s*** that has come out, this is just a big no no. - And not even the dudes where hot.. like thats just not fair.5 reasons why it is bad:1.bad acting2.cliché script 3. the blood looked really fake 4. Too much teenage-love drama.5. like, just why?But yeah, if you are into that s***, then you'll have a blast.'",Vampire Academy
236,tiffaney-83033,The movie was absolutely terrible. i suggest you don't waste your time!,1,14 December 2015,"Absolutely loved this book series. The movie was terrible. If you are contemplating watch this movie, don't. Its a waste of time. I highly recommend the books. The movie seemed like more of a parody than a book adaptation. When the movie rights were first discussed, I was very excited to see one of my favorite series played out. Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe what I felt when I watched this movie. It was even worth the five dollars I paid to go see it in theaters. The story line was completely butchered and the acting fell flat. The actors were not similar to the book descriptions, and their acting was terrible. The movie appeared to be more of a comedy than an actual developed plot. I would NOT recommend this movie!!",Vampire Academy

238,axsy6,Whether it will be the other parts?,10,17 December 2016,"I really hope that there's gonna be other parts. This is my favorite movie. I have read all the books. I know that in the movie isn't the same like in the books, and movie could have been better. But it's pretty good. They have selected fantastic actors, and by the way my favorite actress is Zoey Deutch. So, like i said movie could have been better,but it still deserves other parts. I really want to see other parts of Vampire Academy!!! I'm from Serbia, Pancevo. Here in Pancevo this movie and the novel aren't that so famous. For those who haven't yet watched this movie or read the book, i really recommend! But i think that it's better to first watch movie, because movie will allow you while reading a book to imagine what it looks like all.",Vampire Academy
239,ellajxu,"Overall, an OK movie",4,6 October 2017,"I feel like they had many really attractive people in this movie to make up for the bad acting skills. But some scenes were not too bad. I think the actors were not good at expressing sadness, shock, or anger. There were also quite a lot of actors that I have seen before in this movie. It is not terrible, but not the best movie I have ever seen (actually not even close). It is funny, because the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was such a good movie, but the second time I watched it, i really had a lot of criticize about it.",Vampire Academy
240,gracehoggard,Wow ever heard of subtly guys,1,29 March 2017,"Now I love the books but even as a standalone movie this is awful. The editing is rushed and makes no sense, one scene Rose is climbing out a window and without even a cutaway or anything in between we get Rose and Jesse about to make out.The characters are sort of like they are in the book but there is far too much attitude. Lissa is meant to be gentle and kind and although the darkness from the spirit does get to her she never takes it out on Rose like THAT. Rose is OK, her behaviour is pretty close to the book and one of the only characters who should be behaving like that. Kirova, my god I just, I was stunned at how aggressive she was being. In the book she's frustrated and doesn't quite understand the situation with Rose and Lissa, she threatens to send Rose to the blood whores but she treats Rose like that because she broke the rules not because she hates and loathes her with every ounce of her very being. OK movie we get it we need to hate her, especially when she pulls out the syringe, seriously movie. Lastly we have Queen Tatania, first of all the Queen is supposed to come in when they are all sat down at tables and the Queen will move around chatting to the Royals if she wants to, its considered a great honour to have the Queen stop and talk to you so that's why its a big slap in Lissa's face when the Queen SUBTLY says while commenting on the power of her names that the name does not make a person. She doesn't just point and scold and she definitely doesn't mention the dead animals (Why the cat, it was a bird in the book), its not meant to be private it is meant to be overheard but she doesn't just say it outright and then she goes on to say I hope you'll turn it around somehow, just no.No, just no, you got the Strigoi right guys good job but um YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE THEM UNTIL THE END OF THE MOVIE or at least ROSE ISN'T. That's why she loses the fight at the end not just because its Natalie but because she's the first Strigoi she's ever faced but no you had to introduce them at the very beginning so the audience knows about the 3 types of vampire. You couldn't have just I don't know showed the Strigoi attacking someone who is not Rose.Lastly, there was no mention of Dhampir's biology and genetics. No acknowledgement to why Dhampir's exist and why they protect Moroi which I would think is pretty damn important to the plot especially for Dimitri and Rose as the reason they shouldn't get together isn't just Lissa's safety.I just don't understand why they added so much that wasn't in the book, rivals that don't exist and the cliffhanger at the end makes no sense if you know about Strigoi and how they live.But one thing I liked, a teeny weeny bit, was the last action scene because of Rose's talk with Victor and Natalie as Strigoi was pretty cool, I especially liked when it cut back to Rose and you could see the guardians dying in the background.",Vampire Academy
241,alainabergstrom,If someone made a film from the sparknotes writeup,3,20 July 2021,"This film has the feel of bad fan fiction. Honestly the only decent portrayal is that of Rose, but even then the writing is so choppy that it's hard to watch. The headline says it all. It feels like they made this movie using only a summary of the source material as a guide, rather than the source itself.",Vampire Academy
242,brianthornhill,Bloody good,7,12 November 2020,I can't believe the reviews am reading about this film i haven't read the books that this film was based on. But what i can tell you is that this film is definitely worth a watch with a nice twist at the end,Vampire Academy
243,mrsmng,The promise to be amazing but they failed it,1,19 November 2017,"I really wanted to like this. I am an avid fan of the books but unlike a lot of avid fans, I am realistic. I don't diss movies because they don't follow the books. I am realistic enough to know that an imagination is going to trump budget, location and time constraints every single time. And as much as I really wanted to have the entire series made into movies, if they think about follow on's they need to have a good hard think. The movie itself had two trailers. One was a mean girls, laugh a minute, spoof which looked dreadful and the second was darker. So it was my hope that OK, directors of the mean girls wasn't going to be a good advertisement but maybe the found a way to combine all the elements. It didn't. The book series is excellent. Its not sparkly vampires, think more The originals than Twilight. Its dark, its serious, but there are some excellently written light hearted Rose Hathaway moments. The dhampir who conforms to nobody and isn't afraid to rebel. What did we get? Canned laughter type moments, moments that should have been funny but weren't. More a Disney type channel comedy aimed at children. I get it should appeal to non book readers, to people who have never ever heard of Richelle Mead, but that went so far the other way there is no surprise it bombed. Such a shame, such a let down for something that could have been better than all the movies that came before.",Vampire Academy
