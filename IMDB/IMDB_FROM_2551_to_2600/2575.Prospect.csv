0,nogodnomasters,You need me.,5,9 February 2019,"Damon (Jay Duplass) and his daughter Cee (Sophie Thatcher) are gem prospectors in a distant world. They take a landing pod from the orbital mother ship. They miss their mark and travel on foot to the location. The gem is contained in a living organism like a pearl and must be extracted using specific technique and tools. Other people are on the planet. Through circumstances, Cee is forced into an unlikely alliance.Kudos for Caldwell and Earl to come up with something original. Like most science fiction, the characters are overly boring. Unfortunately, the plot doesn't lend itself to any great social message which is the prime directive of any science fiction theme. It does touch on ""the greed"" thing but not too well. The bulk of the film is Cee walking around the planet in her suit with Pedro Pascal.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Prospect
1,kosmasp,Science Fiction Road movie,8,6 March 2019,"Although I guess technically since there are not roads on foreign (alien) planets, this term is sort of wrong. But you get where I'm going with the summary line I'm sure. After an initial slow start, things get mixed up when two unlikely pair of people clash (or is it ""meet"") each other. It's not that the pace goes frantic after that encounter, but the stakes get raised.Which is a really nice twist and a really good way to move the story and the movie forward. The affection or lack thereof between characters is something to behold. It is also something that if you get behind, will really keep you on the edge of your seat. Really good story telling and really good acting too. If you like a Science Fiction movie that is more drama and character driven ... this is for you",Prospect
2,Tweekums,A fun little sci-fi with western tropes,7,14 November 2021,"Damon and his teenage daughter, Cee, are heading to a forested moon where they hope to strike it rich prospecting for precious gems. It won't be easy though; the air must be filtered due to toxic spores and anybody they encounter is unlikely to be friendly. Things go wrong from the start; their lander is damaged as they enter the atmosphere and they miss their intended landing site by some way. An early encounter leaves Cee on her own; if she is to survive and get off the moon again she will have to make an unlikely alliance.I rather enjoyed this film; it might not be a classic and was clearly made for a relatively small amount but the story is solid in a fairly simply way. It may be set on a distant moon but the plot could come straight from a western. It is somewhat episodic with our protagonist facing a series of dangers that she must overcome but that isn't a problem. The tension is kept fairly high as there is always some danger to be overcome. The small cast does a solid job; most obviously Sophie Thatcher who really impressed as Cee; a character who toughens up nicely as she overcomes various dangers. Also notable are Pedro Pascal as Ezra and Jay Duplass as Damon. There aren't too many special effects but those that there are are pretty good in an unshowy way. The setting looks good; the forest being lush but also somewhat claustrophobic; one can't help feeling it would be easy to get lost there. Overall an enjoyable little sci-fi that is well worth watching.",Prospect

4,CinemaSerf,Straightforward survival picture.,6,20 September 2021,"The problem I had with this film is that it isn't really sci-fi at all. Aside from an early few scenes as ""Cee"" (Sophie Thatcher) and her pop ""Damon"" (Jay Duplass) travel to a remote moon hoping to make their fortune, the rest of it is pretty much an on the ground adventure film as the pair search for gems whilst combatting fiends human and otherwise. I suppose the moral of the story is that greed is no good thing - and indeed her father's attitude contributes significantly to the problems the young girl faces as she tries to get the hell off the rock - a task easier written about than done! It doesn't have much of a budget so makes no effort to dazzle us with snazzy visual effects - which though rendering the story a little lacklustre, does enable us to appreciate the efforts of the young Thatcher - she makes quite a decent fist of this. It is just the rest of it that is just a little too basic and rudimentary to stick in the memory. I always moan that most sci-fi films nowadays are all about lights and CGI, and never about a good story and characterisations. This has much more of the latter, but sadly just too little of the former to distinguish it from a rather traditional episode of ""Dr. Who"".",Prospect
5,deloudelouvain,If you can read lips it helps.,5,19 February 2019,"Disappointing, that's the word that resumes this movie for the best. Maybe I expected too much of it, but I read alot of positive reviews so my expectations were obviously quite high. The story starts promising but soon it turns out to be too slow and not that interesting. But what bothered me the most was the unclear mumbling conversations throughout the whole movie. And that's not even because English isn't my native language, as my wife is American and she also didn't understand half of what they said. And that was mostly due to them speaking through a radio in a space suit for almost the entire movie. With no subtitles and guessing what they're saying for half the movie you just lose interest and than it becomes boring. The acting wasn't bad, just wished I could read lips.",Prospect
6,westsideschl,Failed Middle School Science,2,25 March 2019,"A moon with a planet so close & large it fills half the sky - duh! So much for middle school science & the concept of gravity. That moon, long ago, would either be a part of the planet or little dusty bits. The tropical forest was laughable. More so laughable was the '30s level science incorporated into the storyline coupled w/'50s era technology. The spaceship overall design made no sense; also little round lights & manual switches. Then there's the terrestrial space suits taken from H.G. Wells era (First Men in the Moon '64). What old Hollywood props studio did they raid? Reminiscent of those really bad, dumbing down, '50s sci-fi movies. Realistically it would cost billions to to support this future event for ... a few little glassy rocks.",Prospect
7,851222,Would have been great if i would at least known what was going on in this movie,6,4 March 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Prospect"" (2018) is a very strange movie. Strange in a sense that it was not badly made at all and i liked acting by both leads (Pedro P. was the reason i picked up this movie in a first place), set design was also pretty descent, but on the other hand - what was going on in the first place? Were was the place were we action took place? What is the time? What happened? Why did this all was going on? I like sci-fi movies which raises questions, but ""Prospect"" did not raised them - while the main story line is very easy to follow, the movie needed to explain a bit to its viewers place and time of it all. Without it, movie lost me to be involved, and only solid acting by two leads saved it from beeing boring as hell.Overall, i'm a fan of sci-fi movies, and ""Prospect"" isn't a bad one, but its biggest flaw is that it does not explain or at least hint on the world it takes place. I had no clue what was going on, and its not a good thing for a movie in general.",Prospect

11,Vartiainen,A side story from a greater universe,7,13 December 2018,"Prospect, directed by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell, is a tale you could see on the fringes of a larger story. It tells about a young teenage girl, played by Sophie Thatcher, who lands on a distant planet with her dad (Jay Duplass), to hunt and harvest precious gemstones that might be their ticket to better life and prosperity. But, on the outer planets, you run into all sorts of danger.Prospect is not a large story. Its about a single life, single girl, trying to survive a horrible situation. This story could be told in many ways. It could be a three page short story in a pulp magazine focusing on westerns. It could be a side plot on a TV series. It could be a whole novel, if you padded it and fleshed it out, but even then there's not that much to bite on.And that's exactly why the film is so refreshing. Because it is such a rare piece, because it chooses to focus on a smaller story. And because it such a well-told narrative, it manages to make such a story feel grander than it is.It helps that the film is brilliantly made. You can very easily see the limitations of the budget, but fortunately modern effects are so good that you can tell a science fiction story, set on a distant planet, and make it seem real even if you don't have the budget for huge sets and elaborate props.The acting is also surprisingly good. Thatcher plays her character very mellow, very low-key, but it works. Pedro Pascal as Ezra, a mercenary harvester, is also brilliant. Just the right amount of quirk mixed with world-weariness.Prospect is an easy recommendation if you're a fan of the science fiction genre. Beautiful visuals, interesting scenarios, great world-building and off-beat story moments. What's not to like?",Prospect
12,henry8-3,Prospect,6,16 September 2021,"A teenager and her father are searching for valuable underground jewel deposits on a forest planet when everything goes wrong and the girl is faced with having to be responsible for her own survival.Rather neat admittedly low budget sci-fi which is one of relatively few who try to show a grittier, more realistic look into the future and largely succeed - despite some imaginative flourishes it all seems to make sense. The 2 principal leads do well, particularly Pascal and you do care what happens to them resulting in some inventive and exciting set pieces. The story itself is pretty simplistic, but this doesn't spoil the film - definitely worth catching.",Prospect

Protective suits are necessary due to toxic spores in the atmosphere of this world which seems to mainly consist of temperate rain forest. They find a gemstone within a fleshy pod, Cee tries to persuade Damon that this is enough but he has links to dodgy diggers which promise a big prize. Everything in this film seems old and well used from the suits to the spacecraft and even the weapons. Clashes with claim jumpers, intrigue with mercenaries, odd human villagers who resemble a hillbilly family, gunfights. An interesting SF/Coming of age adventure with a convincing performance by Thatcher. Written/Directed by Chris Caldwell and Zeek Earl in their feature debut. 7/10.",Prospect
14,peterp-450-298716,A must see for SF fanatics.,8,19 April 2019,"The Queen's Lair.
That's a theory.What a fantastic SF! Not because there are breathtaking space landscapes. Or because impressive, galactic battles are being fought. And you won't see a collection of exotic-looking aliens. To be honest, everything looks pretty cheap. As if someone has searched through the props room of large film companies just to collect remnants of old fiction films. The spacecraft, a drop-pod, with which Cee (Sophie Thatcher) and her father Damon (Jay Duplass) land on an unknown, green, swampy planet, looks like an old decrepit, plastic garbage bin full of mechanical push buttons and levers with instructions under it in a foreign language. I immediately thought of the old Moulinex kitchen appliances that my mother used to use. And I briefly compared it with the first Star-Wars film from the 70s. And also those old SF books from the library that I devoured as a young boy. Even the film poster resembled the cover of such a book.Perhaps it's also because I was so fascinated by this imaginative universe the makers created. The limited budget meant that they had to be inventive and develop a sci-fi world with limited resources. An environment that doesn't look earthly and where unknown techniques are used. To be honest, I didn't really understand what it was about. What did Cee and her father have to harvest on this planet? Were the marble balls, called Aurelac, a source of energy? Or were they precious gemstones? No idea. But it was obvious that they are worth a lot of money. And that's also the cause that wandering figures (apparently there are a lot of failing landing pods) try to steal each other's crops. Cee and Damon experience this at some point when they encounter Ezra (Pedro Pascal) and his companion. And from then on it's a struggle for survival.I understand some people will say this is a slow film and that they'll complain about the lack of action. No, this isn't a film with heroic laser fights (even though there is an occasional firefight) and intergalactic chases. But if you succeed in empathizing with this strange world, as I did, then everything suddenly becomes more fascinating. At certain moments I found the dialogues between Cee and Ezra touching. And even though they are diametrically opposed to each other, there's that sudden understanding and acceptance that makes them work together purposefully to flee this planet.The setting where it takes place isn't really unearthly. A swampy jungle, full of strange trees covered with mosses and giant ferns. Interspersed with reed-like landscapes where you expect a wild duck to fly by any moment. But these two characters, walking around in an old-fashioned looking space suit with a giant space helmet and a flexible hose connecting them, make it feel like science fiction. And there are also other minuscule details that ensure this. Such as the steampunk headphones Cee owns or the strange language she scribbles in her notebook. And when they come across a religious group that resides in an ordinary camping tent on this planet, you surely get the feeling that you are in a different solar system.All due respect to Sophie Thatcher, who makes her debut on the big screen with this film. She played so naturally and relaxed that it didn't look like acting. A mysterious teenager with a mysterious past. A girl who doesn't know much about her past and apparently never had a real home in her life. The most surprising thing was how you see her grow up as the film progresses. A fantastic acting performance. The most colorful figure is that of Pedro Pascal. A kind of criminal type who sounds rude but he always uses such lyrical, verbally exaggerated language (sometimes difficult to understand). That way everything he asks or tells seems to be incredibly important. The chemistry between the two characters is what drives this film to the final.""Prospect"" is an intriguing film in which the use of interesting and inventive ingredients creates an exciting cocktail that leads to a strange, retro SF. The only thing the two connected (literally and figuratively) main characters want to achieve, is a safe return to the mother ship. And time is important, as they have to make that launch at a specific moment during the cycle. Perhaps the storyline is fairly simplistic. But in my opinion, this storyline fits perfectly with the minimalist view of this extremely successful SF film. This is definitely recommended for SF enthusiasts!",Prospect
15,robertemerald,One to watch out for,9,15 October 2019,"Every now and then one comes across a movie that sufficiently impresses, that you tell yourself you'll pay attention to anything else the writers or the Director does in the future. Prospect is one such movie. The story is a clever idea, not totally original, but with an almost a Western feel which certainly works, much like Young Ones (2014). Once dressed up with great planetary graphics, great spaceship sets, cool, if hardy, gadgets, a believable planet (though some more cgi would have helped), great camera work, good editing, good lighting, wonderfully chosen soundscape, and well chosen and highly committed actors......well, it's a cool winner.

This is a simple but effective psychological drama, interestingly observed and imaginatively set. Despite a laboured start establishing the theme with characters pushing buttons and winding up apparatus as filler, we get to the crux of the story and a detailed depiction of prospecting on an alien world. While the spectacle is minimalist it is an engrossing human story with an interesting plot on competitive advantage. The otherworldliness is captured from the beginning and sustains throughout and the lived-in style is not just necessary due to the budget restrictions, it is also skilfully achieved.",Prospect

29,garethcrook,Good DIY Sci-fi,7,21 April 2021,"There's something to be said for a gritty sci-fi story. Sure 2001 is beautiful and there's lots of grime in Alien. Prospect is nothing like either. I suspect it's gritty partly due to a DIY aesthetic and a small production budget. You can make stories like this work without money and slick visuals though. A small isolated cast, cut off and isolated in space. Cee (Sophie Thatcher) and her father Damon (Jay Duplass) are in an old crate of a spaceship that looks like it was built by a production dept in the 70s and it performs as such, crash landing on a planet far from where they're supposed to be mining for gems. This is the genius. They're on 'The Green Moon' so instead of desolate red planets, full of dusty mountains, they're in a lush green forest world... and they're not alone. Father and daughter are suited up, helmets, oxygen and all the equipment they need for mining the gems, which is more a process of alchemy than digging. They stand to make a lot of money, but they don't have much time. If they miss the space station, that's their ride gone. That's not the only danger of course. I said they weren't alone. There are other miners, it's like the Wild West in a space forest. One such lawless creature is Ezra (Pedro Pascal), a desperate man who with his mysterious partner threatens to compromise Cee & Damon's mission and lives. It looks gorgeous, with a muted grade, retro tech of analogue switches and the forest environment. It would've sat well in the 70s sci-fi boom. It doesn't mess about either. With Cee finding herself in a battle for survival against all the planet has to throw at her. Hostile natives, deadly toxic atmospheric dust, but in Ezra she finds an unlikely friend. It's not overly original and it's steadily paced, but the characters are likeable, the scenery simple and effective, the plot direct. The two leads work well together. Pascal bringing the aloof cool he delivered in a The Mandalorian. Thatcher conveying the naive unease we feel as strangers on this world. It's does play the action card a little unnecessarily, but I still enjoyed it.",Prospect

In fact, I would include this movie among other films like Arrival, Ex Machina, Blade Runner 2049, Edge of Tomorrow, Lucy, and Predestination, all of which are a part of the thought provoking story /theme /character-driven science fiction film renaissance we've been enjoying over the last several years.

Well acted and pleasant enough to look at, but pretty plain, which is what gives it the slight edge, no vfx, ray guns, jet packs etc. The key to the above average rating though is the dialogue, it is written for adults. The downsize, well it does get a bit 'WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THAT?' and somewhat far-fetched. Yes it is sci-fi but as most in the genre it does fall into the trap of the hero having all the luck and the protagonists being completely useless with weapons and superiority.

Everyone wants a Real throwback movie like that! An artistic and badass movie!
Unfortunately... The Prospect Is None of that!
It was an utter disappointment how the boring story was unfolding. It doesnt have the kick of those classics movies. Action scenes sucks, there's nothing frightening that's after them. Its such a shame that we Yet again as an audience got letdown. The correct visuals are there but the idea and script is made like the typical low budget indie movie that just ends up with people just running and walking around in spacesuits.
A real great Cinema masterpiece needs MORE!
WHAT A WASTE OF OPPORTUNITY REALLY.
This is yet again proof that the wrong kind of people is in buisness on the indie movie scene and the blockbuster scene. People have just forgot what moviemagic is all about.
This movie really needed some balls.
Take the marshmallow man in ghostbusters or the Queen in Alien as a Great perfect example. That's what Prospect really needed. Something really terrifying. Or at least had a trick up their sleeve.

35,fciocca,"A low-budget movie with good ideas, but lacks in execution and substance",5,5 February 2021,"""Prospect"" is a small sci-fi production, with a decent script, but unfortunately lacks in execution. I like slow burner movies, but something need to happen. For the most part we see characters wandering around this alien planet and in one hour and half, there two, maybe three interesting encounters.

He completely stole the scene. Maybe I am little bit of a fan, but he is undeniable good, and honestly he did not have much to work with. Very disappointed by Sophie Thatcher, which was completely unexpressive. Her character could have been interesting, but the portrayal is awful. She could not carry any kind of emotion. This was for sure one of the biggest letdown of the entire production. When a movie has a really small cast, you need to make sure that all actors are good, because there is no way to hide an unskilled performer.I have enjoyed the representation of the moon, populated by toxic dust. Visually speaking this movie really sets miles away from the average science fiction film (in a positive way). The setting in general is nothing crazy, but yet very original and beautifully conceived.

Amazing set design, sound design and costume design but for me it couldn't reach to the same heights with the overall story, characters and dialogue.A single father and a young girl are wondering around in one of the moon's of an alien planet looking for hidden gems that will make them rich but it quickly turns into a survival situation.",Prospect
37,ExpendableMan,"""I know well the lure of vengeance. I myself have frequently indulged.""",8,10 September 2021,"'Prospect' is a quietly rewarding indie sci-fi flick. It tells the story of a teenage girl who gets stranded on an alien world in the distant future and has to team up with a morally ambiguous stranger in order to survive. It's not a flashy, big budget affair with exploding spacecraft or massive laser battles, but an intimate and grimy tale of people on the fringes of society.Cee (Sophie Thatcher) travels with her father (Jay Duplass) to a forested 'green moon' to harvest crystals that are worth a fortune back in civilisation. Things go awry however and soon, Cee finds herself having to work with Pedro Pascal's articulate outlaw to find her way back home. From this relatively straightforward premise, 'Prospect' turns into an engrossing picture. It has a few flaws, most notably in how quickly one character gets over having an entire limb removed, but this is an enjoyable gem.The atmosphere is the key to the success here. 'Prospect' was clearly filmed in an earthbound forest, but thanks to the score, the swirling dust and the actor's performances, it seems eerily alien. The characters keep their space suits on whenever they're outside and it's a remarkably effective visual cue. The green moon can support life, but humans are the interlopers here and the air could well be toxic. The practical effects and costume design are cool too. Everything looks old, battered and cobbled together. These aren't professional astronauts funded by NASA, they're working class nobodies scraping a living on the frontier, using equipment that's been used and re-used a hundred times before.This grounded, low-budget style won't be for everyone and 'Prospect' is likely to polarise audiences. Fans of inventive science-fiction that's a million miles away from glossy studio affairs will definitely want to check this out and anyone still mourning the death of 'Firefly' will too; Pedro Pascal is basically Mal Reynolds all over again.",Prospect

A pretty awesome space pirate tale that could've been shot in the backyard, and yet still look out of this world! It takes place in an unspecified place and time, or I just simply missed it, anyways... It starts with a father-daughter team of prospects, they are digging for these valuable gems on an alien world, all perfectly legal, but dad, played by Jay Duplass, wants to hang behind the rest of the prospects to essentially dig for buried treasure, risking being left behind, dragging his innocent daughter along for the ride... And as you may have guessed things don't go as planned, when they run into a couple other space pirates looking for loot themselves. (side funny note... the other guys, one is played by Pedro Pascal, Oberyn to Game of Thrones fans, and his partner is this huge masked silent man I couldn't help but to think was The Mountain, they put aside their differences after all...) There's a brief little scuffle between the two groups and well, things change.

42,BillBayard,"More adventure than sci-fi, but that's okay",7,10 November 2021,"Well made and somewhat unusual small sci-fi film that's more about character development than special effects. About the latter, I loved reading here about how they created the ""poisonous dust"" in the air that we see in every outdoor shot in this film. It's very well done and they've created a most haunting atmosphere apparently rather cheaply. The unusual thing about this film is that we don't know what year we are in, where the main characters have come from in their spacecraft or where they have landed. In the long run, I guess it doesn't matter. If we were to know any of those things, it would not change anything about the film, but not having this knowledge sort of keeps us interestingly a little lost. The two space travelers are a father and daughter who land in their creaky craft and start their search to find great riches with some bumps along the way changing the narrative. Pedro Pascal, despite having a lengthy list of credits, is an actor who has mostly escaped my notice and he is really good here and extremely charismatic as a character whose motives we don't really know a number of times. His dialogue kind of reminds me a bit of the wonderful Firefly/Serenity. Sophie Thatcher is also effective as the young daughter. This is nothing sensational in any way, but it is an engrossing little film that didn't earn a dime and according to this site, is a remake of something even more obscure than this!",Prospect

After a long wait for release, it lived upto expectations.",9,5 February 2019,"I am a science fiction fan whole heartedly, and saying that feels like a understatement.But unfortunately the genre gets very few additions these days - that are truly science fiction. And not more fantasy being labeled as science fiction, or using 'syfy' as a sub-genre.This is a purely science fiction story, set in its own unique world. Perhaps some plot aspects are a tad lacking, but that leaves you to fill the blanks with your own imagination, which you're provided enough information to do so. It's not totally void of plot. It just suggests a much bigger interesting world that the writers envision this story being apart of.The acting is really brilliant by all involved. It fits the tone of the film very well. --
The cinematography is wondrous and beautiful, helping create the foreign but familiar world the story is set. Using full advantage of the very small amount of CGI on display, but making it all fluid and natural to look at. --
The themes on display grab your attention, A strained father/daughter relationship steeped in surreal science fiction, of a man dragging his kid with him across the stars, but still relatable to any deadbeat father trope.
The compromise and trustless alliance that grows with the two leads. An Uneasy journey from beginning to the end. Both actors along with good writing, creating the reliance on each other in a way that didn't feel forced.It's a film that these days is seen as risky, and won't get much funding. But it's these types of films that should show large studios, that creative - original ideas can be executed with very good quality. And that risks are worth taking still, so that the medium of film doesn't completely degenerate into by the numbers dramas, unfunny comedies and no substance action/superhero films.I truly hope in my life time, I see the direction of film studios regress back to taking risks. They already lose so much money on these high budget dung heaps that fail at the box office with increasing frequency. Sticking 20 mil a piece into riskier projects, perhaps someday, will seem like a viable option again... One can only hope.",Prospect

52,just_in_case,It being a good movie seems like a bonus.,10,10 February 2019,"What floored me the most about this film was the attention to detail. This is how you make small budget scifi. Its a shame that so many indie scifi films are brought low by a focus on story and forgetting immersion. This movie is downright filthy. Every piece of technology looks used and beat up, lived in and thats so important. Whomever was in charge of set design, bravo. Its original star wars, blade runner, MOON, MONSTERS quality set design and costumes. These are poor miners and mercenaries. Every piece of gear should look rusty, hand cobbled and it does. This movie looks soooooo good. Even the main planet scenery, which could easily be a familiar tropic bog has this beautiful filter and light effect over it that makes it stand out as other worldly. They took the time to create familiar yet other worldy music like something out of cowboy bebop. Jazzy, hispanic, asian sounds whether real or not feel foreign. They created a separate written language just for consoles and sketchpads, never even calling it out(they did that in Star Wars, look it up.) The dedication to worldbuilding in this movie is just jaw dropping. I love the cobbled together rifle that uses hand charging batteries. The aesthetic reminds me a bit of these old scifi shows/films from the 80-90 cyber revolution Desert Punk and Zeiram.and I guess, the movie is also pretty great. The characters are all very believable though Pedro Pascal really carries this movie with his dialog being a unique combination of Mark Twain purpose and Shakespearean adjective style. What I really liked is that for all that work mentioned above its never dwelled upon. Some low budget scifi films, when they know they did something neat, will sit there and make you stare at it while nothing happens for 5 minutes. I promise you this movie has none of that. It moves at a really nice clip to a beautiful bittersweet ending.I honestly kinda want to give this movie a 10, but I think that would just be too personal. Some people don't take set design and cinematography as serious as I do. I would recommend this mainly to the MOON, Blade Runner(original) audience.

Using a 50s and 60s retro sci-fi aesthetic to tell a western story was really interesting and fun to watch.

That's all you need to know, and should know, as there are some plot twists that should be left unspoiled. Trust me.The movie's well directed and written, besides some clunky dialogue in spots, and the world is artfully rendered. It's made on a budget, so there aren't any extravagant sets or creatures, but it does feature lived in, authentic looking technology and an atmospheric alien environment (reminiscent of Annihilation, but a tad more Alien).The performances were all very good, Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal, being the standouts.If I had to describe it, I'd say Prospect is an old-fashioned western set in space, with a touch of 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' (another movie about prospectors).

The action and special effects are not bad. Just nothing special.(Although I must admit I was confused by the planet having sun, water, green trees, plants, grass --- but no animals, birds, insects --- and the humans needing space suits with oxygen tanks. But when they go in tents, all of a sudden they can take their helmets off? Plants breathe carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen. Why was the planet's atmosphere toxic?)Oh well, like I said, it's not really sci-fi. It's just a well acted drama in outer space.

The sound/music is fantastic, and shots from outer space are surprisingly impressive. If you're a big fan of CGI or mind-blowing cinematography then you may feel underwhelmed by this, and that's OK. It's something different though, and it's one of the more intense and gripping stories I've seen in some time. Love the realistic action of the gunplay; these weapons are certainly from tomorrow but there's no pew pew here. They seem unreliable, and difficult to fire, though extremely deadly if your aim is true. Sophie Thatcher provides a breakout turn as an unlikely heroine among a crew of male characters who are all less than noble in their own ways, mostly being driven by greed and desperation.

This film is grounded in a gritty reality that is extremely believable, more so than in any science fiction film I can remember seeing. In the novel world, stories that stick to some semblance of known scientific fact are known as ""hard"" sci-fi. Now, to be fair, there isn't a lot of science on display in ""Prospect"" - it's mostly action, but I will take what I can get! In case you can't tell, I've very much in favour of there being more films like this out there.I very grudgingly rate this a 7 instead of an 8 or higher mostly for technical / production reasons, that are perhaps in turn due to budget compromises. Special effects, music, and perhaps a bit of the acting was a little b-movie at times. But I quickly got over it and was sucked into the story.Also Star Wars writers take note: the main female character ""Cee"" is someone that the audience really roots for by the end of the film. Why? Because instead of being all knowing and all powerful right from the start, her character develops.

Pedro Pascal (otherwise recognizable as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones) backs her up as an atypically articulate bad guy and no-account grifter. The story is about how neither one has a chance without the other.White this is not a ""great"" film, it is certainly much closer to the spirit of what science fiction ought to be than the big-budget overkill out there that has basically destroyed the magic of science fiction (Star Wars: This means you!).

Ambiguity can be powerful, but here it's just unsatisfying. Not sure where the 4 million budget went on this one. The credits are long for something so incredibly simple and what was achieved on screen and in post has a nice sense of atmosphere, but still feels like a half hatched student film. The sound design never really achieves suspension of disbelief and it kind of fails the film, as well as the mix is a bit muddy. The main problem for me was the nonsense sci-fi business the actors do. It mostly makes the film feel dated. That stuff was fine for audiences 20-50 years ago, and can still work in the right context, here it calls attention to itself and pops holes in the world of the film. This nonsense and jargon doesn't have any base or ground in science fact and in a film that takes itself so seriously just comes off as silly. The confluence of this all becomes disjunct right off the bat in the first minutes of the film; the writer director team should have done more science homework to at least cushion viewers with basic science knowledge. A few sequences in this film really work before the line goes slack again, so Hope they keep at it and try again.",Prospect
80,hlee-74887,A Hidden Jem,6,13 March 2019,"The modern scifi film allures to spectacular big market CGI action with over exaggerated characters. But this relatively unknown film with unknown casts can hold its own. The set is surprisingly effective and the actors are very convincing. The young girl in this film portrays a strong protagonist and does a spectacular job. The counterpart is charming as he is cunning. The two are left to trust each other in the most unruly situations and forced to bond out of necessity. But what makes this movie work are the creatures they meet on their journey. Creatures that are eerily close to the uncanny dark side of humans. As their struggle hits obstacles after obstacles, they must confront the truth that humanity may not prevail on this foreign planet. The only problem i had was the ending. It's creepy. But as a film, the makers did a decent job.",Prospect
81,Elijah_T,Which do you value more: Wealth or Survival?,10,29 April 2019,"Prospect is a really well done father-daughter story told in a believably odd SciFi world. To speak more of the centerpiece of this film would be a dive into spoiler territory. Just know that it's a hell of a dynamic. And if you don't get what I'm talking about after having already seen the movie, just think back to the dialogue.There's something in the very beginning of the film that's very immersive, well done, and new to me. That's all I'm going to say about it.The costume design is so on point here that I spent the film anticipating every new character. It's like Dead Space mixed with Prometheus if everyone purchased their gear from a different manufacturer in separate regions.The minimalistic soundtrack is so good that I stayed through the credits just to hear more of it.Alternative Title: ""Prospect: Of Fathers & Daughters""A word of advice: don't watch the trailers. They spoil too much. Listening to the 2+ minute trailers only provides two minimum and a single moderate spoiler for three key events in the movie.

82,PhilipGHarris,Less is More,8,20 September 2018,"Prospect never tries to deny its roots. A space Western crossed with a Scifi movie which seems to have somehow escaped from the height of the 70's. Giving a gripping tale of a prospectors daughter and the slowly developing relationship that grows between her and her father's killer. The first order of business, to survive!Things aren't quite that simple though, as directors/writers Christopher Caldwell and Zeke Earl choose to throw the watcher straight into the midst of this working world, with little exposition to explain what is going on. Prospector Damon already takes drugs to sleep and enough to avoid the desperation of his life, as his daughter, Cee, simply seems to be stuck. With no friends and her memories, she desperately tries to write in quieter times.Prospectors go to 'The Green' to find gems, like pearls from oysters, hidden within buried creatures and these gems are their way out of poverty. Prospecting seeming to be an expertise and one her father is good at, bringing you to imagine that the poverty they are in is imposed; like Joseph Hellers Catch 22. However, a poor encounter with Ezra and his Number Two leads to her father trying to become the thief and being shot in the process. Cee escaping to the safety of their pod to find it has failed and she is trapped. The time ticking to return to orbit in time to depart with their haul.The Green seems to swallow up many, as Ezra is also trapped by his own volition, and is seeking escape before he too gets swallowed by the landscape. The directors making this lush world as menacing as any post-apocalyptic world, despite the trees and life. Other arrivals seem to have chosen to remain, in a semi-religious fervour and yet more mercenaries seek out the right people to extract the gems they also seem desperate to retrieve. The whole both reminiscent of the classic Boy and his Dog and also Cormack McCarthy's The Road, as we see Cee grow from girl to woman through the movie.Given that the film manages to keep many elements obtuse, with dialogue sometimes lost due to the poor comms systems and the ticking time Cee keeps glancing at, but which is unreadable to the viewer, as prime examples: As well as questions about the reason richer companies aren't mining these resources. What Prospect cleverly does is never to reveal how much time has passed. As Cee and Ezra's relationship grows organically, but Cee herself seems older and wiser from event to event, to even her smile as they leave. Is it really just the fact they've escaped?Sophie Hatcher and Pedro Pascal are simply immense in the lead roles, with the amputation section being both wincingly uncomfortable and gloriously black humoured at the same time. But the support cast are also well crafted and engaging, yet never revealing about their own situation and why they are stuck in this horrific place. The music and SFX evoking the feel of the film perfectly.Prospect is never going to be everyone's type of film. Slow moving, character driven and often intentionally avoiding giving you the facts. For those who like the genres mentioned, this is a true find and worthy of your time.",Prospect

But here, the focus is on the bits that works in bith genres and they rake the opportunity to explore what the genres do have in common. The effects are more than convincing and the characters all get to shine even when appearances can be brief. The plot, while simple on the verge of simplistic is fleshed out just enough.It's about a girl having to trust an untrustworthy man in a situation where a single mistake each minute can easily result in a very painful demise. Like with The Martian, it needs no more and doesn't pretend to do what it cannot.We need more well made sci fi like this.

Though this could easily upset certain viewers, the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack paired with decent dialogue and directing allows you to sit back, and calmly enjoy the journey of the characters.Speaking of characters, the arcs are exactly what one should expect from a low-budget sci fi: brilliant. The fight for survival, greed, and trust all blend perfectly together in a highly immersive and original experience, topped off by the excellent acting.But perhaps the one thing key to the emotional impact of Prospect is the VFX work. Those part of the industry will have heard of the supervisor Ian Hubert, a man of true originality. The striking atmosphere isn't just generated by the hundreds of dust shots, but also the Ian Hubert look. The defocused bloom, the subtle color palette, the low contrast and the mild sunlight make the world feel truly dreamy yet real, perfect for the tidy 3d models to be thrown into and blend beautifully with the practical surroundings.",Prospect

These themes dont need a scifi context, because they are omnipresent in our lives already.Actually I pity todays youth, for in my younger days we had terrific and mindblowing scifi like Logan's Run, Soylent Green, The Andromeda Strain or Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

The sci-fi trappings - rusty space-suits, cranky spaceships etc - are authentically rendered, and the unchartered terrain, a sort of Ewok-free Moon of Endor, breathes with atmosphere thicker than a Frank Herbert Dune doorstop. But they're merely cosmetic ticks papering over a slight tale that would play out exactly the same with buckskins and horses in the wild west.
The story's repetitive narrative and episodic structure quickly reveal the script's shortcomings leaving one with the aftertaste of an all-dressed-up-with-no-place-to-go non-starter.
So PROPSECT could almost be written off as another style-over-content space adventure then? Not quite. Thanks to the performances and to-die-for chemistry of the two lead leads - Sophie Thatcher and the super charismatic Pedro Pascal - writer/directors Christopher Caldwell & Zeek Earl's debut feature star-surfs to safety via muscular character engagement. Cee and Ezra deserve a better story than this, but despite my reservations, PROSPECT does have a lingering effect and I'd love to see these two astro-cowboys again. Maybe next time?",Prospect

If you're into blockbusters then this isn't for you.
I was apprehensive to be honest as I've been burned by indie 'duds' before but this was amazing and got me glued from start to finish.Everything was well designed and the characters felt real.
It felt like being transported to another universe even though the setting of the planet resembled Earth so much. Even though it shows a very bleak version of the future and where it might take us it's a breath of fresh air amongst hollywood behemoths.
The attention to detail to everything the characters were doing, wearing, using, ingesting, everything was impressive.It kinda goes to show that when you have a good concept and a good eye for details you can produce something extraordinary even with few resources.I wish there were more films like that around.ps. obviously the people who rate it 1/2/3 are also biased but on the other end of the spectrum.",Prospect

The action sequences were good and the general storyline was fun to watch. My criticism for this movie would be the dialogue. The dialogue is very hard to understand at times especially through radios and helmets. My other criticism would be plot holes, for some reason the red dude left to die in the cage escapes but doesn't kill the two of them and the guy who came up to the father and Cee suddenly turns into a nice guy. If the dialogue was more understandable and the minor plotholes were fixed this movie would have probably ranked higher but overall I definitely enjoyed the story.",Prospect

Think 2001 Odyssey, Blade Runner, Alien, Arrival, Children of Man and such. It is amongst the absolute best.What makes this movie stick its head above most of the other is that is filthy and greedy depiction of humans on SF - stuff are not shiny and high tech and beautiful Stuff break down, and everything in it seems ""normal"".

It was very difficult to continue watching such a slow-paced film that tells you nothing.I love Pedro Pascal and think he's a good actor, but he seemed really miscast in this. I don't know what accent he was trying to do, but it wasn't working and a lot of the time I couldn't even understand what he was saying. He plays this character so badly, without any presence or depth, which is a shame because it becomes a major role and if the role had been played well then this would be a better movie.The movie is so difficult to follow and I had no idea what was going on for most of it.

I do think it is worth putting in my two cents worth. The film is very flawed however brilliant in many was. Many of the flaws may come from the $4million dollar budget.But most glaring to me was the lack of setup or backstory, leaving me lost in a strange world. I was constantly playing catchup as to who these people were, why they were there and what they were after. This left it hard for me to relate to the characters. What they were after (some sort of gem/plant extract) just did not make any sense and was a little hard to swallow. The script overall was rather poorly done but may have been butchered by budget.Despite its flaws the acting was often brilliant, I was especially impressed by seventeen year old Sophie Thatcher. This stunning young actress gave a very believable performance as cool headed sidekick to her father who had lived a rather tough life.What makes this film exceptional is how small a story this is. This is not Luke Skywalker trying to save the galaxy. This is very much an ""End-of-The-Road' kind of story. A father and daughter who are broke, indebt, one step away from being dead or worse. They have come to an out of the way tapped out, dead end, uninhabitable mining plant aboard the last starship to visit. Its do or die time, and no one will care, or even notice, if they live or not.

Great acting by teenager Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal as the rogue the father/daughter team encounter. The beautifully shot sequences in a forest with lots of particulate ""dust"" in the air at all times was a great counterpoint to the gritty reality of day-to-day survival without too much advanced pseudo-science gear. It was refreshing to see a film where people are on an alien world (in this case a forest moon) that does NOT have a breathable atmosphere and thus have to wear spacesuits and worry about the attendant issues of being on an alien world and being able to make it home, things most sci-fi just seems to make into a non-issue... where every planet has a breathable atmosphere, or at worst requires a tiny filter actors wear over their mouth/nose.",Prospect

Twists, turns, shifting alliances, fortune and glory. I never really knew how the story would end. (Actually, I still wasn't 100% sure what had happened when the credits rolled, but I really enjoyed the ride.)Instead of hitting us over the head with heavy amounts of visual effects, Prospect leaves a lot of the action out-of-frame and lets the viewer's imagination fill in the blanks. Normally I hate this, but it works in this case thanks to a beautifully-executed layer of sound effects. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack, and I thought all the ""alien"" languages were a nice touch.Prospect reminds me of 2 movies:1) District 9, another gritty, dirty, relatively low-budget movie that began life as a short story, later getting a feature film, and
2) Pitch Black, a fun little story we're thrown into without a lot of explanation while featuring some cool mysterious characters.Both of these had tremendous sequel potential and I feel the same is true for Prospect. I certainly hope this isn't the last we'll see of Cee!",Prospect

The daughter is forced to team up with an unlikely partner to escape the planet before their return home has swung by and left the planet's orbit.As simple as the story is the execution of PROSPECT is excellent. Special effects are meager but convincing. Sets are few but realistic. Small physical details such as medical equipment, weapons, food packs, and written language are remarkably complete. Photography and color are times lovely, at other times gloomy and foreboding. Costumes, especially the ever present pressure suits mandated by the planet's toxic atmosphere, are amazingly varied and realistically worn-looking.Most impressive, however, is the acting. The main characters, especially the young girl, are convincing and very well portrayed, despite the chracters spending the bulk of the movie in the aforementioned pressure suits.PROSPECT is proof positive that a convincing and engaging sci-fi film need not be produced with a bloated budget or the overwhelming effects of a superhero or end-of-the-world cataclysm.

The strength of this movie is in the world building. Every item, every detail is still recognizable, yet changed, modified, estranged, belonging to a remote version of our culture.

Flight software in a casete, buttons, switches, bulbs and cathode-ray screens, a spacecraft cobbled up on the cheap, an emphasis on second-hand equipment for the cash-strapped heroes. That's all fine (even atmospheric), and the absence of CGI or other special effects is not missed, if you got a solid script to back a good story. Alas, this is not the case with this movie. It makes the most of our planet's natural environment, making it look outlandish. Acting isn't bad either. But all of this rests on thin air, when it comes to a story that goes somewhere. Things happen and in the end our heroes stage a narrow escape, but none of the other folk appearing have any proper reason for doing so or offer much by way of exciting twists and turns, the end scenes are rather puzzling (how did the condemned redskin guy break free?) and all you are left with is a basic ""tried to make some buck by mining a planet but failed"" scenario.

It has the look and feel of classic science fiction films like Silent Running or Alien, with a tangibly chunky, retro, industrial aesthetic which adds a real layer of believability to this tale of frontier prospectors, desperately searching an alien world for extra-terrestrial bounty. It's essential a western script transplanted to space, but it's carried off which such skill and dexterity, that you are glued to the screen right through to the nail-biting final showdown. The acting is top rate - Pedro Pascal of Mandalorian fame in turn menacing and sympathetic and Sophie Thatcher is a real find, who will no doubt go on to great things.

The primitive nature of their technology is somewhat dystopian, which makes the story that much more real. The score and soundtrack contribute so much more to the atmosphere of this movie than scores and soundtracks usually do. Only the one actor was vaguely recognizable, so I don't imagine their budget was huge, but what an accomplishment. This is definitely up there with the best of sci-fi and the best of films in general. A simple, captivating story. Great performances by the actors and actresses.

There seems no shortage of acting talent for indie films these days. A veteran like Pedro Pascal delivers as a good a performance as one could expect from his role, and Sophie Thatcher is solid as ""the girl"" (although she doesn't reach the emotional depths you'd expect from someone forced to endure these events). An indie SF film can succeed if it has a brilliant screenplay or at least a vision that fully justifies and requires it's SF setting (e.g., Moon, Primer, Mad Max). The story in Prospect is a lackluster adventure/survival tale that, divorced from its colourful alien setting, would be forgettable. The dialogue is workmanlike (again, not terrible), the plot progression predictable.The story feels like a Western set in space. The futuristic setting doesn't elevate the story; in fact, there are many questions about the world and society that could be easily answered but never are. Given the lack of world-building, setting the story in the 1800's American frontier (which it easily could have been) would at least have had the advantage of drawing on a background of solid history. Here, it feels like the writers are just making things up to move the plot along. As far as being ""hard"" SF, there's nothing in the film that deserves that label other than the acknowledgement that you need a suit to breath in an alien atmosphere. The grungy tech circa 1970's seems more an affectation that realism - you could make things more believable even without CGI.",Prospect

But is it anything new and fresh like some reviewers are saying? Well, yes and no.
Take away the space suits and this would be a great film about gold prospectors in the wild west at the end of the 19th century.
But personally I must say I love the fact that it's set on another planet, and unlike most space movies this planet has beautiful forests but not a breathable atmosphere. Combining these different elements is what makes this movie so fresh, although taken apart neither the wild west feel nor the space thingy are original in and unto them selves.
I must also add that the acting is great, especially from Tatcher and Pascal, and it is beautifully shot and the soundtrack ties it all together in a epic but gritty feast for eyes and ears.
My only complaint was sometimes I had a hard time figuring out who some of the characters were, or more precisely how they got there, what they were doing and how it all relates. But that is just a minor setback and the story rolls on regardless.

I like the acting of female lead.If you are looking for a good scifi with less booms, more story and acting than this one is for you.",Prospect
180,bOOnish,Recommended! (But obviously polarising),8,7 February 2019,"As you can see by the reviews posted so far, this little gem polarises the audience.One share of the Reviews is 7-10, the other 1-3. Almost nothing in between.Probably this his to to with the expections.Well, if you're looking for some fast-paced space battle pew pew laser action this isn't the movie you want to watch.
This isn't a movie about aliens or about high-tech spacecraft.
It's a movie about a few people in a difficult situation.Made using simple means but with love to the detail. Retro in the best sense. Slow but thrilling. Good acting.To give away too much of the plot would be a shame. So just watch and enjoy.

That alien planet looked a lot like planet Dirt oh i meant Earth some forest part. Weapons looked like some sticks that went pew-pew when shooting.

184,nillzhillz,I desperately wanted to like it more,5,23 March 2020,"I always feel bad giving movies like this a lower rating. You can tell there's some real soul put into this- looks like it was done on a shoestring budget, and for whatever they were working with (I'm guessing it was not much) they did a pretty good job. It has a nice firefly-eque western space drama feel. The CGI is used sparingly and theres some descent props.There's some real thought and beauty in the details here, culture elements; the music, mechanisms for spacesuits, the mining/harvesting lore, etc. There's the potential here for some really great world building. So, where does it fall short? Well without beating around the bush it's just a bit dull...and with the care taken with the world building its really disappointing to see the lack of a real substantial plot. What is there is bland, and at times a bit muddy. The characters are ok, acting is descent, but about 10 minutes in you know exactly where this movies going, and it takes its time getting there.I'm not one to shy away from the more human/dramatic elements of sci fi, on the contrary non-stop action tends to bore me. Unfortunately, so did these characters, so did the overall plot, and the themes.I think we're getting to the point technologically where essentially if you're driven enough, you can get some pretty polished looking films, even as an amateur. I think that's what this is, essentially a very technically polished student film. In that regard it suffers from the same pitfalls much of that work does. A good idea, with some unique elements that aren't fleshed out. What's left of the story drags on and falls apart in a predictably amateurish way.To the writer/director, a commendable effort. Keep up the good work, there's potential here. Hope the critique is understandable.5.5/10, rounded to 6. Worth a watch if you're in a patient mood.",Prospect

There is zero backstory, the film just kind of starts and strings you along, but never answers any questions or clarifies things.I don't really get what the point of this film was. I mean, it didn't really amount to much of anything in the end. I enjoyed the visuals/cinematography and I'm such a huge fan of sci-fi that I tend to overlook faults, but I really don't think there was many redeeming qualities in this film.

186,brumatrix-672-867668,Months after watching I still reflect this...,8,4 July 2021,"This is superb Sci-Fi writing, period! I can only try and explain, why I still catch myself thinking about this movie every now and then, like in the very moment before writing this review.The story is so realistic and beliveable, that it actually could have happened in a future far, far in the past. And maybe it did, who knows.Fantastic performances by every single actor. On point, no overacting or behaving like you would't expect people to do in the described circumstances. Especially Pedro Pascal presented his talent. The characters had such deepnes, which the writer was able to create with so little but profund information, which is transported in such a subliminal way, that you don't even realize it in real time, but more subconscious.Very seldom I've seen the main character like the young woman, reacting so rational and natural in a movie. I can't think of anything I'd done different.I believe the reason why this movie fascinates me for so long, beside the fact of the magnificent world-building as so many reviewers have stated, is that it is an extraordinary well depiction of human nature. In almost every sentence and dialogue about things, the characters have done, events that comprise this universe, this typical human behavior is shown. This is exactly what makes it so believable in the end. It makes no difference where, who or when everything happens. Times can change, places can change, climate can change but human nature never does and probably never will!Yes, there truly is something melancholic to this fundamental fact and this movie manages to transport this message in such an unbiased way, that it will always have a place in my memory.An absolute must wach for hard Sci-Fi fans and still a great story for everyone else.",Prospect

188,rock_bustin,Excellent Sci-Fi Limited (only slightly) by a Limited Budget,8,21 February 2021,"Saw this on Netflix as a random choice and ended VERY impressed! In these days of Super-Hero movies & ""It cost $200 million to make so it must be good"" movies this movie was a very unexpected change. For me, a fundamental aspect that every true Sci-Fi movie must address is: painting a picture of a future world, a different world, but one that is as realistic-appearing as our own. This, ""Prospect"" does vary well with a skillful combination of subtle CGI (atmospheric effects) and clever set-dressing to transform a (presumed) actual living forest into a convincing alien one via using theatrical tradecraft. It works - very well. Kudos to the tech crew for this. Ms. Thatcher, the lead is no Bette Davis and that's a good thing. Understated is how her character should come across. She has to play a young woman trying to thread the needle of a dutiful daughter who is throw into peril by first her own father's greed, and then the mortal dangers that surround her. Her unwanted and scheming companion played by Pedro Pascal performs and evolves his character, making him a perfect foil for Ms. Thatcher's cautious yet brave walk through danger.In some ways, the film reminds me of Ray Bradbury's, ""Illustrated Man"" - which also has a similar trek (though very different plot) thru dangerous wooded landscape in the episode, ""The Long Rain,"" which was in the 1969 film version of the book with the late-great Rod Steiger starring.Yeah, I wish they had more money as both the story and the cast deserved it. But the product is a fine one. Don't worry about the negative reviews, they wouldn't know Sci-Fi without light-sabers anyway. I highly recommend you give it a watch.",Prospect

I really found myself believing in the people and their universe. Everything felt fleshed out and yet achieved with minimalist elements rather than heavy handed exposition and glaring camera shots. The performances of Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal particularly stand out, at the same time portraying the depth of their characters and the nuance of their burgeoning relationship.
Being a Firefly fan I may be biased, but I found this film an extremely pleasant surprise. I've never felt motivated to write a review before, but I couldn't help but sing the praises of this film and hopefully sway a few people into giving it a chance.",Prospect
191,revenant83,Meh,5,7 April 2019,"Sophie Thatcher was good and believable, right up until her character befriended her nemesis. We never saw her father actually die, so there was a bit of an ""is he, or isn't he dead"" false tension throughout the film. There's not really a clear explanation/setup for why either character needs the other, or why they don't betray one another at some point, especially given what we know about them. Honestly, it's a little creepy that Pedro Pascal's character keeps Cee around. It would have made more sense as a plot device if she offer him at the end, but as it was, it was a bit of a Lolita relationship. Overall, it's watchable, but nothing special.",Prospect

194,atsmiller,Basically watchable,6,15 February 2019,"In this film, there are three plans which can be assessed separately that in many ways work against each other.
First, the acting and the actors. Although Sophie Thatcher wears a space-suit most of the time, she's quite easy on the eyes. Honesty this forces me to note that, as a middle-aged man, I would have probably stopped watching this movie if Sophie Thatchers character Cee wasn't there. In all actuality I'm being a bit dishonest - the acting in the film is generally great; I don't mean only miss Thatcher, the other characters are also very believable and amazingly well played. Yes, at times the dialogue sucks, especially for people outside the Anglo-American cultural space. Some moments of alienation emerged as a result - even in a vastly distant future the characters are still able to emit some third-rate US commercial TV debris out of their mouths... But these are little things. Anyway a great job!
Content - Western. Although most people grow out of stories about how different companies of people climb around lawless outskirts and embezzle loot from each other, there is nothing wrong with such stories in itself. Certainly, I do not want to undermine the genre. But if I do want to watch a western I choose the most atypical one I can find, much like this movie.
Third plan - Sci-Fi. It sucks royally. Or lets say otherwise - it's always possible to make a comedy or a parody. But let's decide! Yes, there are some pretty fun movies-series where a stupid story is put in the middle of the 60's sci-fi mumbo-jumbo; where characters in colorful jumpsuits jump on cliffs made of cardboard in a studio, and everything from the huge moons to purple flowers are so genuinely fake that it can't be taken in any other way than a joke. Rocket-powered Caterpillar might have been a tough word in the 70s, but nowadays, there are more electronics and better controls on an excavator than the world's first joystick stolen from a museum or a Pre-World War II microscope. It's just unbearably silly. The planet itself... well, you're still in Kansas. The yellow-orange filter and the giant planets projected into the sky get the job done briefly, but in a matter of minutes the same thing will become disturbing - how cheap and lacking in fantasy!
Yes, if the story is good you can forgive the makers - you can't demand that the filmmakers have any clue about science, technology, and even science-fiction, and maybe there was no money for CGI or for hiring someone who knows at least something...
In conclusion - a relatively good story and performance with a likeable protagonist in the strikingly stupid background.",Prospect

Apparently a lot of these people liked the slowness of the film, but I honestly felt like this movie was just too slow. I don't like much action myself, but this was extremely slow and it almost felt forced to be that slow. A lot of people said they liked the focus on the different planet, but it really wasn't that different than earth. I mean I saw a bunch of trees and ferns, earth has trees and ferns too. My biggest complaint (besides the slowness) was all the new gadgets and technology that was thrown in and not explained. It all looked cheap and we had no idea what most of it was or what it's purpose was. Ok I knew the gun was a gun, but it looked like they just took a bunch of garden tools and threw them together. If your going to introduce us to new technology (even if it looks cheap) at least explain to us what the things do! It didn't feel like any of it connected well. At one point I honestly thought the movie was just for people on drugs. I understand what people liked about it, but I didn't like any of those things.

While the girl and her father spend every moment together, you see that he is an absent father figure distracted by his goals and later greed.
It's less a story about finding gems, but more a story about a young girl finding someone more attentive, and looking out for her well being, better than her actual parent.

207,treespaz,"Movie Review: ""Prospect"" is Dirty, Dark and Delightful",7,21 October 2018,"TORONTO AFTER DARK 2018Grim and grimy, Prospect is one of those films that really wants to be a sci-fi western and for the most part, it succeeds, thanks to some great direction by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell, solid performances and wonderfully bleak atmosphere that surrounds this entire film.We meet teenager Cee (Sophie Thatcher) and her dad Damon (Jay Duplass), piloting their space freighter on a mission to find some very valuable alien gems that will, in turn, make them very wealthy. Of course, they're best-laid plans go out the window and soon they find themselves in the company of a rival named Ezra (Pedro Pascal) and all bets are off. A complicated relationship begins between Cee and Ezra, he becoming a weird anti-father figure to her, and this is where the movie begins to really get interesting.Earl and Caldwell, co-directors and co-writers of the film, do a great job setting the stage with some wonderful tension, haunting landscape, and great visuals. Earl, who is also the cinematographer, paints a great picture using a great combination of CGI and practical effects. The planet that Cee, Damon, Ezra, and scattered others are on looks great and deadly at the same time. Death is always hanging there, whether in the form of humans or things all around them native to the planet itself.Sophie Thatcher as Cee is a joy, slowly ramping up her performance as the movie moves along and has a very weird, complicated and necessary relationship with Pascal's Ezra. For the most part this collaboration works, driving the movie forward although at times there are moments where their scenes are too telegraphed, the characters and their 'relationship' too familiar. However, that doesn't take away from the performances, especially Thatcher who is very strong in her role as Cee.While it is this relationship that drives the film, Earl and Caldwell are smart enough to know they will need more than just this, and interweave dark and beautiful landscapes during this western sci-fi trek. The interiors at the beginning, those inside the spacecraft, also come across as very real and somewhat claustrophobic. It is a nice contrast to the vastness and open country of the planet the bulk of the film is on, although being in those suits still gives the audience that claustrophobic feeling, which is a very nice touch.Although there are moments in the film where some of the dialogue suffers and the scenes or scenery scream 'been there, done that', the movie reaches for the stars, no pun intended, and is successful in creating a great story and atmosphere for the audience to enjoy. Science fiction comes in many shapes and sizes but when it is dirty, haunting and human-like Prospect, it is a much more interesting story to watch unfold.",Prospect

My husband was immediately REALLY into it, commenting on the scenery, set and props; he loved the fact that it was low budget and not over-produced. I did enjoy watching it, but it didn't linger. After a second viewing with my 9 year old son I have come to appreciate it more.First, I have to say that when it ended (abruptly) I wanted more from their time and more of her story. Story is what this film is all about. They aimed for a natural, real-life feel with the cinematography, which worked well with the futuristic dialogue and unknown environment. Suspense draws you in, but there are many details left unexplained and plot holes. Was this intentional so the audience would keep their focus mainly on character development? I was entertained enough by their actions to see it through, although I wish they had gone deeper. They did do a damn good job making it feel realistic and unique. The music score helped sustain the otherworldly ambiance.Okay, now... I don't want say this, but I think it would have been so much better if Pedro Pascal had approached the character differently. I'm sorry, I had to say it. The script is fine, but some of his line deliveries are so inconsistent and awkward. That's just my personal opinion. He was definitely the right actor for the job; there were some great moments between his character and the girl, but I think he could have nailed it with better direction. (Another example would be Wonder Woman 1984) THAT SAID, I would love a sequel or prequel to learn about their back stories or what happens next. I've decided to change my rating from a 7 to an 8.

So a 5/10. I watched this based on the 7/10 given but it needs to be lowered.

227,sphinkrink,Suspenseful and Captivating Sci-Fi Gem!,9,29 December 2020,"Totally surprised by this movie. The plot was such a tiny sliver in time, but still so captivating, intense and interesting. It jumps right into the movie with little to no explanation and it moved along at a nice pace for the rest of the movie. It felt very much like I was along for the ride with lots of questions of my own instead of being given a guided tour, and I liked that. I had a hard time predicting the plot.The tension among all of the characters was really good. Pedro Pascal is such a great actor. There's basically no character development with all of the roles.... some zero actually, but yet they still play an integral part... and I felt that made it more believable because you don't always know everything about everyone in real life. From some actors not showing their faces to others speaking a different language, it made everyone so mysterious and unpredictable.I loved how the technology was old and clunky, not shiny and new. It gave me the feeling that anything could break down at any time. Their guns didn't go ""bang bang"", but made more of a dart gun kind of sound, which was more foreign, deadly and unfamiliar. The science of it felt very believable to me too. We're not seeing flying spaceships, droids, laser guns and alien monsters. Instead, it's landing pods, marooned people, old equipment and plant-like aliens.All in all, this was a solid sci-fi movie regardless of it being low budget or not. It sucked me in for an hour and a half, got me to believe it could happen, and had me guessing. I'd definitely recommend it.",Prospect

232,roadkill6,A lot of unrealized potential,3,25 October 2020,"I think this movie could have been a great series, but less than two hours wasn't enough to develop these characters. There were several plot holes that never got filled here (They have to wear space suits, but tent zippers keep out the alien atmosphere?) but I can always look past that if the story is really good. It was very obvious early on that Ezra (Pedro Pascal) and Cee (Sophie Thatcher) were going to have to team up and I was looking forward to seeing a relationship develop between them (a la True Grit or Léon: The Professional), or an exploration of Pedro Pascal's fatherly character (a la The Road or Kozure Ôkami) but that never really happened.Nothing ever came of Cee's vague origins or her father's admission that there was something he should have told her. The amputation scene was potentially the biggest character-building scene for Cee, but the scalpel on an electric toothbrush really killed the vibe and her skill with a knife doesn't pay off later.If we had seen the relationship between Cee and Ezra really develop and there was some internal conflict between one or both of them about the arrangement, then it could have been a good movie, but that never happens and we are left with a disappointing and mostly unfulfilling shootout ending to a mediocre loss-of-innocence story.",Prospect

238,maggielovitt-57720,Masterclass in World Building,9,13 February 2020,"Prospect was the feature debut for writer-director team Christopher Caldwell and Zeek Earl and proved to be an ambitious masterclass in simplistic worldbuilding. It began as a humble Kickstarter funded short film which debuted at SXSW in 2014 and grew into a 4 million dollar feature film starring Pedro Pascal. The film proves that the sci-fi genre doesn't have to consist of large budget, CGI-heavy stories with overwrought plots.Jay Duplass plays Damon, an interplanetary prospector, who travels from world-to-world with his teenage daughter Cee (played by Sophie Thatcher) trying to make a profit off the rare materials they harvest. While venturing onto an alien moon in search for their next harvest, disaster strikes the farther-daughter duo when they encounter Pedro Pascal's charismatic Ezra and Damon is killed. The film doesn't get distracted with unnecessary expose, while Ezra and Cee go their separate ways on several occasions, they are drawn back together in their pursuit to get off the toxic planet. Cee and Ezra make for an infinitely more interesting father-daughter style duo than Damon did, though that may be due in part to the charm of Ezra's character.As I watched I couldn't help but wonder if the creatives behind The Mandalorian had used this film as their deciding factor in casting Pedro Pascal. He is effortless in his portrayal of Ezra, making the best of his dialogue and love-to-hate persona. Cee and Ezra have to rely upon and trust one another in order to get off the moon and the undercurrent of 'found family' is interesting to watch.The film doesn't concern itself with explaining when it is set, though given the spaceship that Damon and Cee live on and the somewhat dire post-apocalyptic feeling society, one could believe that it's set sometime in the not-so-distant future. The writers utilized clever subliminal dialogue about the film's universe, which managed to invite the audience in without bogging them down with inane details. It provided just enough details to make the world believable and unique. What resonates is that the filmmakers are grounded in the reality of the world they've created and they are able to share that security with the audience. It was a small window into a larger world that felt real and strangely familiar.Caldwell and Earl's straightforward approach to sci-fi storytelling has the potential to spark a new generation of storytellers, borrowing from the classic 1970s-vibe of films like Star Wars. If the story is good and the world is believable you don't need massive budgets to create an engaging movie. Prospect isn't a thought-provoking movie, but it is 100 minutes of interesting storytelling, simplistic sets and costumes, and a masterclass on how good science fiction can be when its at its best.",Prospect

253,TheReturnOfGon,A powerful new voice in Science-Fiction.,10,29 May 2020,"What a true little gem of a sci-fi movie this is. Let's say you were to compare this to similarly budgeted first films of famous a-list filmmakers like Gareth Evans, Tarantino or Rodriguez, Prospect shines in ways that are unexpected. It might be just as good, if not better, than these films. The people who made this film have bright things ahead of them, that much is certain.Both main actors deliver inspired, subdued performances with Pedro Pascal exuding some of his signature charming, yet threatening, charisma that is sharply contrasted by Sophie Tatcher's vulnerability. The design of the movie and the world is rich with subtle details, and delivers a lo-fi analog sci-fi aesthetic the likes of which you haven't seen since the 70's. Yet it all makes sense in this world, where ressources are sparse, competition is fierce, and tech needs to be as simple and reliable as possible.Oh the soundtrack and photography are gorgeous, too. Both often recall spaghetti western movies, an influence that Prospect seems to proudly wear on it's sleeves with all the stand-offs, uneasy alliances and unavoidable bloodshed. This is, after all, very much about the hardships of frontier life and a very unsubtle nod to the tragedies of blood-soaked gold rushes that occurs right under our noses. And that speaks volumes about the strength of Prospect - the scope of the story is small and intimate, yet you're constantly aware that this takes place in a much bigger universe. A universe that appears ripe for many more stories and perspectives.Highly recommended!",Prospect
254,Wanderbru,prospecting the void under the surface,3,24 August 2020,"The beginning is very promising. you're let to believe you're going to watch a good movie. the setting is well crafted, the photography is ok, you feel like you're going to get the answers that start popping up in your mind watching these 2 people doing apparently random things on a space ship. it's incredible how quickly it all collapse into nothing. all the genuine sci-fi curiosity that's grown into you about this weird planet and the business humans have do do on it, evaporate when carachters shoot one another like it's a western movie from the 30s. and you immediately find out the screenplay doesn't have any story to tell, at all. the girl ends up wandering in the woods without knowing where she's going just like you don't know where the movie is going. what appears to be them main plot line takes abrupt bumps that detour it into random scenes where new characters you don't know anything about talk about random deals that should bail out some meaning for the plot. with no result. Just like when you think something that was thrown to your attention before is going to get an explanation or develop into something meaningful, the plot detours again into new characters and new deals that end up in another ridiculously poorly shot shooting scene (pardon me). the characters, instead of being the pillars above whom a screenplay builds a story by developing their relationships (like in any good movie), here are dull, flat, empty, interchangeable puppets that stumble one over the other all the time with the aim of hiding the complete lack of inventive for a story line. dialogues are made irritatingly uncromphensible by the insertion of some random vocabulary that like anything else in this movie never get any explanation. the other faults of the movie are also very apparent, but have to do mostly with the fact that this is a low budget movie - so they're excusable (for example the ridiculous weapons that look taken from Willi Wonka).
If you want to save something from this movie, you might probably pick the acting which is above par compared to the rest, and a couple of scenes where something in the popular tradition of sci fi is 'quoted' and used effectively (like the mercs using bad music as a torture tool - which recalls back to the future). but that's really it. bad sci-fi, but bad filmaking first.

The story paints an accurate picture of history repeating itself well into the future, this time with the gold-rush occurring on a planetary scale, with all the same ruthlessness and violence shown in the All Gold Canyon segment of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, where Tom Waits plays a prospector. Not since the first Alien have I felt like I was watching an original science fiction film where the actors clearly were not just staring a green screens, but actually living and acting in the settings of the film.

The writing is profoundly bad. Characterization is nonexistent. Motivations are muddled or nonsensical. There is very little in the way of a plot.

277,tokrika,A superb gem within its genre,9,1 October 2018,"Typing on my phone just out of a film festival viewing so this is not going to be as detailed and organised as I would've liked. But the film deserves some rambling first impressions.Many major science fiction releases from big studios in the past few years have been horribly cast mistreatments of lovely source material ( Valerian), angsty YA dystopians or wastes of opportunity (jupiter ascending).Prospect is not a big waste of money, nor is it a waste of the audiences time. It's a beautifuly we'll crafted glimpse into an unknown future where humanity is still just as human as ever. It doesn't utilise the power of its genre to force upon the audience the possible developments of current or imagined social or technological trends. It does however place it there somewhere subtly in the background and gives you the time to pick up the details and read between the lines.The world building of the expanded universe is beautifully crafted by the props department, and even if costumes do sometimes leave something to be desired, a lot has clearly been achieved with limited means. Along with some cleverly written dialogue with unique speech patterns for each character lets you know of a larger world and richer characters outside of the little scenario we're witnessing The story of a few cast-away individuals scurrying amongst the dregs of a formerly booming prospecting industry on a soon to be abandoned moon is held together by a simple selection of location scenery. Whenever the relatively slow pacing of the film could let you get bored with the repetitive landscape, a powerful vista of the gas giant the green moon is orbiting reminds you how alien everything really is.Sophie Tacher delivers a very convincing performance as the young girl afraid to be stranded in a corner of the galaxy soon to be forgotten while Pedro Pascal does a calm delivery of his charmingly unsympathetic rouge. The score is well crafted, but at times I miss a more aggressive sound.The high score I've given it isn't because this is the best out there, but because it is pretty much as good as a space-western low budget indie can hope to be while preserving the mold.Short version is: 'true grit' on an alien moon, with some early George rr Martin melancholic sci fi spice to make everything more interesting.",Prospect

280,minttt,A simple but compelling story with amazing world building!,9,23 June 2020,"First of all, sorry if my wording is not so precise, english is not my native language.This is my first review here. I almost wrote one for different movies a couple of times, but never felt the urge to do so in the end.
This movie on the other hand is so fantastic, that i just have to write my point of view on this gem. It's rare to see good sci-fi movies these days, that are not full of over the top technology, space battles, cheap drama, hollywood tropes and cliches etc.First of all, the cast is superb. Pedro Pascal and Sophie Thatcher play their roles perfect in my opinion. There is not too much dialogue, but the facial expressions and the overall conduct, especially of the girl, is just on point. The rest of the cast is great as well, Bubbles from The Wire has a weird and small role in it too.But what i loved the most is the overall atmosphere, the movie is beautiful shot and the world building is just impeccable. There is so much going on in the background, that it just makes me want to know more about this whole universe. For example the weird pop music that sounds like an asian language, the little stickers in the pod, the mentioning of different planets and cities, the kit and tools to dig up the aurelacs and so on. Just fascinating.
The whole technolgy looks worn and sometimes odd, but has a realistic feel/look to it. It reminds me in a lot of ways of 70s and 80s sci-fi and their world building, especially Alien.
All of this is never really explained, the movie just hints at a large and fascinating universe. But thats what i love, it leaves room for your imagination.A must watch for every hard sci-fi fan, who is interested in something different from the usual.",Prospect
281,michaeljh,"Okay, it's not Star Wars",7,9 November 2020,"This is an intriguing story that has a few too many ""ain't space life dull"" scenes. The overall plot and Pedro Pascal's dialogue reminds me of an old western movie. Think of a mixture of True Grit with Deadwood. Now if they just hadn't mixed in so of 2001:A Space Odyssey, they would have had a nice movie.",Prospect
282,pablo61,Enough to keep me watching. But some cues off of Serenity,6,14 October 2021,"Serenity is a 10/10. Prospect is an even more gritty space drama. Cast is a good one , but lacks something (maybe budget) to make it to 7 & 8s + . Verbal styling cues from Serenity. I have grown tired of space 'adventures totally failing. The Martian restored my faith a little. Conclusion a decent watch , plenty of plot which is apparent from the very starytwists, in a nobody trusts nobody way , obvious from the VERY start.",Prospect

286,trishgwynn,Unexpected Little Gem,8,3 March 2020,"Nice little gem of a sci-fi movie. I'd never hear of it before and initially started watching because I saw it was made by Dust - a company of which I'm a fan of on YouTube, they make a lot of little sci-fi shorts posted there. This is not really space-based, so space shots are minimal, the majority of the film is spent on a forest planet (or is it a moon?) full of toxic spores, and there aren't any space battles or a huge good vs evil arc.It's a simply told story of a girl and her father who are poor miners/prospectors that have contracted to set down on this planet to mine for gems for a group of mercenaries, but their plans are foiled when there is a malfunction with their drop ship and it lands off target.As they make their way toward the target on foot, they come across an abandoned prospecting site where they find a valuable gem - the kind they've been contracted here to mine. Because it's so valuable, the father, over his daughter's objections, decide they're going to mine for some more for themselves, rather than going on to do the job they were contracted for. Unfortunately, before they can do so, they are accosted by two strangers intent on robbing them and things go downhill for them from there.It may move a bit slow for some people, but I was fine with the pacing. The acting was on-point, esp. the girl. There weren't much in the way of sfx, but the setting was completely believable and what props there were, were well done and believable, everything looked very well used and out of date - as it would when someone is poor and unable to obtain newer or better, really grounds the viewer to the character's lot in life, unobtrusively, without words.There are no space battles or a big finale flourish - though there's several fight/shoot-out scenes, and the ending is satisfying. All-in-all an interesting way to spend an hour and a half. It's marketed as sci-fi - but could also be simply a thriller with sci-fi elements.",Prospect
287,phillipmoloto,Feel like i wasted my time watching this,1,24 March 2019,It was painful to watch... very boring... too slow and stupid... even the story line didnt makr sense... the actors a good thou...,Prospect
288,indrekruubel,"Looks good, but boring story",7,9 February 2019,"The story revolves around human greed. There are nice shots in space and the overall look is very good. But the story... I just felt bored. Bunch of guys fighting over some gems in the forest. What was the big take away from all this? It's better than most of the superhero ""scifi"" garbage out there, but still. I enjoy scifi movies that have some really good idea. For example Alien - nice idea + horror. Terminator - nice idea + special effects. The man from earth - very good idea and nothing else is really needed, cause it's that interesting. I mean I could watch ""Blood diamond"" (2006), if I wanted a bunch of guys fighting over gems, it doesn't need to be a scifi. I expect scifi to be clever and a have a really good idea in the center. This one is missing that good idea.",Prospect
289,ross-71792,I aim to misbehave...,7,9 September 2019,Firefly has been mentioned by other reviewers. Pedro Pascal puts on his best Nathan Fillion persona with superbly written dialogue to match. It isn't Firefly but there are definitely echoes in the atmosphere because of him. I actually warmed to this movie immensely because of that.,Prospect

291,theosaunderson,Has what's missing from a lot of Hollywood sci-fi,8,11 October 2021,"Firstly, every part of the set design, the clothing, the music, the story and the acting immerses you in the world and they are top-notch for such a low budget film. This film may be slow for general audiences but I really enjoyed it for the subtle changes in relationships and it is some pretty solid writing. To all those low-score reviews, I think you just expected a different movie. If you like believable Sci-Fi and a slow, brooding and thoughtful film then this is for you.",Prospect
292,bogusmcnuts,A rare treat: real sci-fi without pretension or the usual stupidities,9,29 July 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It tells a fairly simple but very engaging proper sci-fi story in a way that makes it refreshingly easy to suspend disbelief: no really stupid bad science or cheesy overblown SFX, and very little clunky exposition (apart perhaps from a little by the dad early on).Others have alluded to a ""space western"" vibe, and perhaps this is somewhat valid in a good way- it would arguably fit quite comfortably in the Firefly/Serenity universe. It's not full of highly conceptual artifice but the attention to detail is very impressive, bringing to life a believably gritty reality that reminded me of Ridley Scott's thinking about the future not being shiny-new, but old and worn.The main characters are nicely understated but relatable, the pace is great, and unlike a lot of sci-fi movies that treat the viewer as an utter moron, this one doesn't over-explain or create spurious tensions and conflict for cheap 'drama'.As a kid I hoovered up EE Doc Smith and old mags like Fantasy & Science Fiction, Analog, Amazing SF et al, still love the stories and novels of Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Simak, Poul Anderson, LeGuinn, Ellison etc and would still rather watch Bladerunner again than yet another trashy superhero 'blockbuster'. Bearing all that in mind, I highly recommend this movie.",Prospect
293,jamesinkson-36832,"Like ""The Martian"" mixed with ""The Road""",9,1 February 2021,"In truth this is actually more like a good novel adapted into a movie.Good, realistic sci fi is hard to come by, and this is a rarity in that sense.Watch it for free on the Channel 4 free streaming service ""All 4"" at the moment.",Prospect
