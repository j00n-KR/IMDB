0,MartinHafer,The epitome of cool.,10,11 September 2010,"This film begins with perhaps the most perfect opening title sequence in film history. The look, the sounds and the titles themselves....all very, very cool. Lalo Schifrin's song is the perfect jazz tune to accompany this and you just know that this movie is something special.The title character (Steve McQueen) is a Lieutenant with the San Francisco police and he and his partner (Don Gordon) are assigned the task to protect a mob informant. Now considering that this is an action-suspense film, what happens next is no big surprise. However, what was nice is how the film combined realistic looking police work with amazing action and grittiness--like combining Film Noir with and action film as well as a healthy dose of cool. I could say more about the plot, but would rather not--as there are a lot of mystery elements about the film and I'd hate to ruin the surprises and twists.The most famous part of this film is, of course, the great car chase scene--featuring a Ford Mustang playing 'cat and mouse' with a Dodge Charger up and down the hills of the city. It's a magnificent scene but fortunately there's a lot more to the film than this--it's NOT just this chase but a well-made and intelligent cop film--a very gritty one at that. To make things even better, the film featuring some excellent actors doing their craft in addition to McQueen--such as Robert Vaughn, Simon Oakland and Don Gordon--who I have always thought was an underrated actor.If you see this film, you may see some parallels with the later Dirty Harry series. Both are set in San Francisco, both feature an undercover cop who hates to play by the rules and both are tough characters. However, McQueen's 'Bullit' is more cool and thoughtful but a lot less intensely angry--and as a result a lot easier to believe...but also a bit less entertaining as he doesn't have all those wonderful Eastwood tag-lines! Personally, I prefer McQueen's style--you may not.Overall, the film is exceptional--one of the best police films of the era. In fact, I had a hard time deciding whether or not to give it a 9 or 10--and giving any film a 10 is something I very, very rarely do. Why a 10? Well the film has got it all--an interesting plot, great action, terrific tension and a realism that sets it apart from the usual cop film. And, it sure has style to boot. Not surprisingly, this film was very influential and was followed by many police films which were reminiscent of ""Bullitt""--such as ""The French Connection"", ""McQ"" and, of course, the Dirty Harry films. The only deficits, and they are very, very minor, is that perhaps McQueen is too cool and quiet as well as how inexplicable it is in the airport scene that none of the many, many travelers seem to notice he is holding a gun. You'd think someone would notice and say something! Still, it's a great film from start to finish and it holds up marvelously over time.",Bullitt
1,TheLittleSongbird,A wonderful movie and I think important too,9,6 October 2011,"I have seen a lot of movies in my short(19 years) life. Some have amazed me, some have been awful. Bullitt is not quite among the best movies I've seen, but it is a wonderful movie and I think too special and important.Why is it important? Many things really, starting with it being the first mainstream film to be shot entirely on location, with the use of real doctors and architects and it actually made an effort to be accurate with police procedures.One might argue that these don't necessarily make a good movie. Maybe, I am not saying that because of the film doing all this it is automatically good. What I am saying is that whether I didn't like or loved the movie(in this case loved) I would always try to acknowledge its importance, if it has any.I can understand in a sense why some mayn't enjoy Bullitt as it is a slow and talky movie. That said, I don't consider any of these flaws in any way. The dialogue is intelligent and clever even in the talky moments, and even though I would hardly call Bullitt a fast-moving movie I personally wouldn't call it a dull one either, thanks to Peter Yates' taut and efficient direction.For starters Bullitt is very well made, with wonderful locations and interesting cinematography. Sparse it may be, but the music by Lalo Schriffin is very effective, slick and very jazzy.Bullitt's story is straight-forward but compelling, the violence even then and even now is unashamedly unapologetic. I have seen my fair of movies that had at least one shocking scene, but the killing of the man standing in for Johnny Ross is on a whole new level of shock and engagement value.The cast are great. Steve McQueen with his piercing eyes and charisma, like he did in The Great Escape, epitomises cool and grit, and Robert Vaughn and Robert Duvall give their usual rock-solid performances. Jacqueline Bissett is perhaps the least exceptional, but even she manages to not be in the shadow too much.And I cannot talk about Bullitt without mentioning the car chase. It is electrifying, not only was it shot entirely at speed with no under-cranking in sight but McQueen did most of his own driving.In conclusion, a wonderful movie, and I think it is too an important and interesting one. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Bullitt
2,bkoganbing,Before There Was Harry Callahan...............,8,18 January 2008,"If Steve McQueen had been of a mind like Clint Eastwood, his Frank Bullitt could have had a whole series of films based on this character. Imagine how that would have been viewed today.Like Callahan, Bullitt is a detective working for the San Francisco, PD and he and partner Don Gordon draw a rather routine assignment, guarding a witness scheduled to appear before Robert Vaughn's investigating committee. Routine except when a couple of hit men get to both the witness and another cop relieving McQueen and Gordon.Vaughn's character is left purposely vague. I'm still not quite sure of what kind of committee he was running, a legislative one, or something like the Knapp Commission in New York. What we do know about him is that he is one ruthless self aggrandizing politician, it's one acid characterization.The rest of the film is McQueen and Gordon trying to get to the bottom of why things went wrong and at the same time avoiding Vaughn who has vowed to make them the scapegoats for the fiasco. It turns out to be quite an interesting story of organized crime intrigue. The user turns out to be one who is badly used.Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt may not quite have the dramatic flare in the way he dispatches the bad guys of Clint Eastwood, but he's a man of integrity here, more than in any other film I've seen him in. McQueen also sticks to his job with grit and determination until he gets his man.Had he wanted to I'm sure we'd be dealing with a whole lot of Bullitt films in the same way we had Dirty Harry Callahan come back four more times. That wasn't McQueen's desire, too bad he never repeated the character.On the other hand if he made more of these, would we have not seen Junior Bonner, The Getaway, Papillon?",Bullitt
3,Leofwine_draca,A great detective film with some fantastic action,8,19 December 2015,"As far as tough police thrillers go, BULLITT is, quite simply, one of the best there is. An iconic leading performance and superb, stylish direction from Peter Yates help add to the BULLITT experience. It's one of those films that has something special about it to keep you rewatching. The loose plot itself is nothing to write home about, but everything else about the film is fantastic. Take, for instance, Yates and his direction, in which it appears thought and effort has been put into every shot, such as where to place the camera, and the particular lighting effect, etc. The editing is also excellent, as to be seen in the memorable car chase through the streets of San Francisco, and the pacing is slow but just right. There's nothing really that could have been done to better this film in any way.The film really belongs to Steve McQueen, as it contains one of the actor's most notable performances. His presence is so strong here that he leaves an impression on the screen even when he's not there. Although he spends a lot of time on screen, you end up dying for him to return when he's not just to watch his method acting. McQueen plays a lot of the film using just his eyes and the effect is tremendous; I know he has his detractors but I can't fault his performance here. If I was an actor this is how I would want to come across on screen.Although McQueen is given most of the limelight, some veteran performers help fill out other cast roles; particularly Robert Vaughn, playing his slimiest part as a corrupt politician out for his own ends who continually hounds McQueen and his men. Don Gordon and Simon Oakland deserve mention for their fine turns as fellow police members whilst a youthful Robert Duvall appears briefly as a cab driver. Jacqueline Bisset is also here as McQueen's girlfriend, although her screen time is minimal and largely reduced to hanging around and looking pretty as eye candy when the time calls for it.BULLITT is a very suspenseful film all the way through - especially the opening moments leading up to the murder attempt - and alternates between spots of brooding mystery and mad excitement. The biggest set piece is the car chase through San Francisco, which is one of the most stylishly portrayed out there, and has a great use of music which propelled it into classic status. However my favourite moment is the airport chase at the finale, which goes on for quite some time but is never less than gripping. BULLITT is a surprisingly violent film at times, but the violence is used for a reason, as a way of making it realistic and a warts-and-all type of thriller, not just another glossy television episode. Excellent stuff and Hollywood at its finest.",Bullitt
4,SnoopyStyle,forgettable story done without intensity ... but then there's the car chase,6,12 November 2014,San Francisco Police Lieutenant Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) is asked by politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) to guard gangster Johnny Ross who turned state evidence for a US Senate subcommittee hearing on organized crime. Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) is his girl. Two of his men get shot. He isn't sure who to trust and is forced to investigate on his own.The story is pretty bland. The dialog is awfully stiff. There is no tension because the pace is rather lax. It's a weak movie for most of the time. Then there is the car chase. It's a fun stunt-filled action sequence. It's not up to the well-constructed level of 'The French Connection' three years later but it's quite a step up in car chase action. It doesn't use projection screens. It's the real deal with real cars driving on real streets. The San Francisco hills make for a great car chase. It is still compelling to this day.,Bullitt
5,Hitchcoc,A Benchmark Film for Future Cop Movies,8,8 December 2016,"Steve McQueen led a short life. He did, during that time, make some significant movies. ""Bullitt"" is one of them. Here he plays a cop who has had enough of rules and regulations. Perhaps he would be considered a bad cop. He chases the worst of the worst. He is a prototype for Dirty Harry in all those Eastwood films. This film has two elements. Really bad guys and a politician who is at the center of much of the drama. Not only must Bullitt apprehend these killers; he must look out for himself. If this seems clichéd, it's because this movie put it out there first. I hadn't seen Peckinpaugh yet, so this was the first movie where I saw graphic special effects of the damage done by a weapon. Of course, to most, the car chase through the hills of San Francisco is the most memorable part of this film.",Bullitt
6,kosmasp,Realism is ... good(?),9,15 January 2020,"I have not read the source material this is based on. And as a friend pointend out, it took me long enough to come around watching this. Then again I might have had issues with the degree of realism depicted here at a certain point in my life. That but also an incredibe car chase is something that connects this movie and French Connection.The car chase apparently was not in the book, but the director already had done an excellent car chase in his previous movie (haven't seen that one yet either), so they decided to put one in the movie too. Apparently a lot of other things were changed too. Some smaller details, some maybe bigger things. Also if you have an actor (personality) like Steve McQueen, things change too. He was very aware of his status and he knew what he wanted.Not always easy to work with I reckon, but had a heart of gold too. Humans are complex after all. I do recommend watching a documentary with him in as the main focus, even though I do not agree with all the sentiments (Magnificent Seven was not stolen away from Yul Brunner in my humble opinion).Having said that, the movie at hand breaks a lot ground and for the time set standards or did things others were not able to afford. Like having Africen American characters in positions of power (a black doctor? Seems normal enough or should be normal enough now, but back then ... something Steve McQueen championed for as the director suggests).Pacing is slow as any ""real"" life events would be. While there is not much violence, when it occurs it is quite explicit! No nudity, but quite some blood then. Just be aware if you are squeamish. Great movie and deservedly considered a classic",Bullitt
7,classicsoncall,"""You work your side of the street, and I'll work mine.""",7,29 December 2015,"""Bullitt"" is arguably the defining moment of Steve McQueen's acting career, so it's hard to imagine that he actually had to be talked into doing it. The film was made at a time when cops were routinely referred to as 'pigs', and McQueen felt that his fans might turn on him for taking on such a role. However the actor decided to play the part against type, not as a clear cut cop, but as his own man with his own rules and sense of integrity. He also did a lot of it silently, using a face that revealed his emotions instead of wasting a lot of useless dialog.As for the action scenes, macho man McQueen insisted on doing all the driving for the now famous car chase scene himself. However wiser heads at the studio weren't about to lose McQueen's star power due to an untimely accident, so for a particularly intense portion of the shooting, a stunt man was used on a day when McQueen overslept and didn't make it to the set on time. If you're watching the movie and can't see the driver, take note of the car's interior mirror. If it's visible in the scene, McQueen's doing the driving; if not, then it's stunt man Bud Eakins. (Source for the above is writer Marshall Terrill in his book ""Steve McQueen"").What bothers me about the picture is the whole business with the surrogate Albert Rennick standing in for mobster Johnny Ross (Pat Renella) who's set to testify in front of a Senate committee against 'The Organization'. It doesn't make sense to me that Rennick would have willingly involved himself to stand in for a known gangster. There's also the convoluted involvement of the cab driver (Robert Duvall) taking note of the real Johnny Ross making calls from a phone booth. What would have made it so interesting that he would note that a lot of coins were used to make a long distance call? I guess I could re-watch the movie but I'm not so sure that would clear things up enough for me.For me then, it's not so much the story as it is watching Steve McQueen go through his motions as the 'King of Cool'. He originally caught my eye when I was just a kid watching ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" with my Dad, and ever since I've kept a sharp eye out for bounty hunter Josh Randall wherever he showed up. Trading in his horse for a Cobra Mustang in ""Bullitt"" was a cool way to go.",Bullitt
8,gavin6942,Fantastic Cop Film,8,18 May 2013,"An all guts, no glory San Francisco cop (Steve McQueen) becomes determined to find the underworld kingpin that killed the witness in his protection.Could this film have the best car chase prior to the ""French Connection""? I think it might. Sure, it involved splicing together many different city streets to make it look cool, but what city has better streets to splice than San Francisco? I do not know how much they have changed between then (1968) and now (2013), but the streets are as legendary as the Golden Gate Bridge.The movie is known for its authenticity and use of real places in San Francisco for sets. I will give them credit for that. It is also known for its cars (a Mustang and Charger), which is somewhat ironic given that it is quite hard to figure out what sort of cars they are if you do not know (the emblems were removed).",Bullitt
9,lee_eisenberg,The car chase and turtlenecks show why Steve McQueen was so cool.,7,10 July 2005,"When people think of ""Bullitt"", they mainly remember the car chase. Granted, it was quite a chase, but there was more to the movie than just that. Steve McQueen plays Frank Bullitt, a San Francisco cop whose coolness irks the other cops. After a witness is murdered, Bullitt has to investigate it.Bullitt's turtleneck shirt and blazer almost stand out on their own, mainly as a contrast to the suits and ties worn by the other cops and the self-aggrandizing Sen. Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn). The car chase is mainly interesting because it's not just a series of explosions: the only explosion happens at the very end.Some good supporting roles come from Jacqueline Bisset, Simon Oakland (best remembered as the psychiatrist in ""Psycho""), Norman Fell, Robert Duvall and even a small role by Ed Peck (whom you may recognize as Officer Kirk from ""Happy Days""). Overall, some parts may seem a bit dated, but it's a pretty good movie.",Bullitt
10,jboothmillard,Bullitt,8,14 October 2011,"From BAFTA nominated director Peter Yates (The Deep), I think I remember that we once had this film on DVD but I never gave it a proper chance, and I knew it was very popular, so given another opportunity I didn't miss it. Basically Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) is the high profile San Francisco Police Lieutenant asked by ambitious politician Walter Chalmers (BAFTA nominated Robert Vaughn) to guard Johnny Ross (Felice Orlandi), a key witness in an upcoming court case against his Chicago based mobster brother Pete Ross (Victor Tayback). Alongside his colleague team of Sergeant Delgetti (Don Gordon) and Detective Carl Stanton (Carl Reindel), Bullitt has Ross in protective custody for 48 hours on the weekend before the trial where he will testify, and the Lieutenant has no questions asked during any decisions he makes. On Saturday night two hit men manage to break into the hotel room and shoot both the detectives and Ross, the cops are only wounded but Ross dies from his wounds, and naturally Chalmers is upset with the event. Bullitt decides to stop the news of Ross's death getting out to people the people that ordered the hit, asking the body to be a placed as John Doe in the morgue, and the chart to be misplaced by Dr. Willard (Georg Stanford Brown). Chalmers is then upset that Ross's body has disappeared, and he and his police minion Baker (Norman Fell) won't get any help from the Lieutenant who is trying to reconstruct the dead man;s movements and find out more about him. There is a point when Bullitt manages to spot the hit men who killed Ross, and the famous car chase against them in the Dodge Charger and him in the Ford Mustang ensues through the streets of San Francisco, and it ends with the two men crashing and blowing up. Back at police headquarters the Lieutenant is interrogated and told to follow up on his remaining lead Dorothy Simmons (Brandy Carroll), but she has been murdered, but then they find out she was actually Dorothy Rennick, and the man they thought was Johnny Ross was in fact her car salesman husband Albert who has no police record. Bullitt confirms this is true, and with the help of passport identity proves to Chalmers that he was protecting the wrong man, Rennick was set up so the real Ross could escape and Rennick's wife was murdered to silence her. Chalmers offers the Lieutenant the chance to further his career, he is refused, and the police detective manages to track the real Johnny Ross (Pat Renella) to San Francisco Airport, and in the end, after trying to reason with him, Bullitt kills him in the terminal. Also starring Jacqueline Bisset as Cathy, Robert Duvall as Weissberg and Simon Oakland as Captain Bennet. McQueen became a screen icon for this great gritty performance as the rebellious cop with deadpan expressions and all the right moves, and Vaughn is great support as the sleazy politician, obviously the best sequence is the simple but equally high octane car chase with hill bouncing, gun play and fantastic editing, but the rest of the film is filled with great exciting moments as well, an essential police procedural crime thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Track. Steve McQueen was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 43 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!",Bullitt
11,Woodyanders,One of the all-time great and exciting police action thrillers,9,9 June 2009,"Tough, laconic, no-nonsense Detective Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen in peak steely and assured form) clashes with sleazy, opportunistic politician Walter Chalmers (superbly played to smarmy, smooth-talking perfection by Robert Vaughn) over the investigation of the shooting of the star witness in an upcoming mob trial. Director Peter Yates, working from a tight and terse script by Alan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner, relates the gripping plot at a steady pace, places a welcome emphasis on stark realism, makes excellent use of the sunny San Francisco locations to further enhance said authenticity, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable skill and brio (besides the now legendary amazing and exhilarating protracted car chase, there's also an equally stirring foot chase in a hospital and a heart-pounding climactic shoot-out on an airport runway). McQueen excels in his impressively stoic, reserved, and completely lived-in portrayal of the weary, yet shrewd and diligent Bullitt, who's an honest man struggling to keep his integrity and humanity despite his grim and thankless job. The supporting cast is likewise exceptional: Don Gordon as Bullitt's equally hard-nosed partner Delgetti, Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt's classy, concerned girlfriend Cathy, Simon Oakland as the stern, but supportive Captain Bennet, and Georg Stanford Brown as the helpful Dr. Willard. Popping up in nifty small parts are Robert Duvall as cab driver Weissberg, Vic Tayback as hoodlum Pete Ross, and Just Tarr as slick informant Eddy. The investigation is shown with compellingly meticulous thoroughness and total plausibility. Better still, there's no silly humor or needless flashy razzle-dazzle to distract from the overall credibility of the plot and characters; the whole picture is done with admirable seriousness and a praiseworthy sense of consummate professionalism. Lalo Schifrin's groovy, jazzy, syncopated score ably pumps up the suspense without ever become distracting or excessive. William A. Fraker's gleaming, polished cinematography boasts a pretty bright look and several nice gliding pans. Essential viewing.",Bullitt
12,ccthemovieman-1,McQueen In The Driver's Seat,8,20 April 2006,"Steve McQueen was usually worth watching no matter what he was in, although he did a few stinkers like everyone else. This is not one of them; he's excellent here as an intense but low-key cop. It's a pretty solid police thriller which features a famous car-chase scene that supposedly set the standard (or maybe it did at the time of release.)What's interesting to note, according to a documentary on the DVD, is that McQueen did his own driving! No stuntman for him, even at 110 miles per hour through the streets. Speaking of streets, San Francisco always makes for an interesting local.Robert Vaughn, Don Gordon, Jacqueline Bissett, Simon Oakland and Robert Duvall complete the big-name cast, but this is McQueen's movie all the way.....and, for a film almost 40 years old, it's not very dated.",Bullitt
13,rmax304823,Sui generis,10,9 November 2002,"I don't know how this film can be criticized as ""dated,"" except in the most superficial sense of the word. It stands by itself. There hasn't been another movie quite like it, before or since. Essentially a straightforward tale of a policeman unraveling a gangster plot, it alternates between trouvée scenes that look and sound as unrehearsed as real life, and spectacular moments involving chases and shootings. It's still a highly stylized film of course. Every shot change but one is a cut, not a fade or dissolve. Most people speak more lines when found in Steve McQueen's circumstances, or so I would think. Most men don't come home to find Jackie Bissett asleep in their beds, a pity. There has probably never been a pursuit like that filmed in the hills of Colma, which is known locally as ""the city that waits for the city that waits to die, to die."" I once saw a high-speed pursuit in the streets of Philadelphia and was amazed at how slowly and carefully both the police and their quarry were driving -- slowing down for stop signs and all that. When the broth is reduced, the plot isn't unlike many John Wayne movies. He's a loner, dedicated to his job, living an otherwise uneventful life in a modest apartment, except for one thing, Jacqueline Bissett. His other contacts are distant or perfunctory. His relationship with partner Don Gordon is defined in the first few minutes as strictly professional, nothing more. He's respected but not loved until Bissett appears in his life. How did he get that way? Who knows? Who CARES, really? A person's development can't be explained in a few minutes of screen time, even if we knew what caused it, without recourse to revelations that have always been clichés -- he had zits during adolescence, or they took away his sled when he was just a kid. Not even cheap shots at sympathy mongering -- he lost his wife recently -- are brought in. Bissett is important to the plot because she represents the possibility of his returning to the human race as a person capable of warm and deeply emotional relationships, however clumsy his expressions of warmth may still be. The conflict between McQueen and Bissett involves her inability to accept the gruesome aspects of the life he leads, a common device. (See John Wayne and Patricia Neal in ""Operation Pacific,"" or Al Pacino and Diane Venora in ""Heat"".) Bissett finally yields and accepts the conditions. Any other ending would have been pretty bleak (she leaves him and he becomes even more bitter and lonely as he ages) or unbelievable (he resigns from the SFPD and becomes a Zen Buddhist monk). Superficially it seems that McQueen has ""won"" the contest, but actually it is Bissett who comes out as the more admirable, flexible, capable of changing and adapting, open to further development in her interests. And as far as that goes, the movie ends ambiguously. Bissett has come back to him, but as McQueen puts his gun aside and washes his face in the bathroom he looks up and stares in the mirror, expressionless. If he doesn't change, the relationship with Bissett is in jeopardy. She will continue to embrace life (I'm glad I don't have to try defining a term like that) while leaving him behind.The movie was released in 1968, probably shot in 1967, the height of Haight-Ashbury and the flower power movement. If this movie were as dated as some people think, the writers and Yates would have worked in a bunch of timely but far from timeless hippies and their lore. The temptation must have been there but was successfully resisted. The city is used iconically and without touristy shots. Nothing has dated, except that Enrico's is now closed. McQueen unholsters his pistol only once, and fires only two shots. If it were done today, can you imagine the final shootout without the hero and villain using two Uzis each and puncturing every wall, shattering every mirror, and exploding every squib in sight? The car chase now looks familiar, of course, because it has been imitated a hundred times since ""Bullitt"" appeared. Around the time of ""The Seven Ups,"" they got tired of just using cars and worked in elevated subway trains, garbage trucks, buses, motorcycles, and so on. The imitations now seem dated in a way this movie simply does not. Whatever happened to our sense of historical depth? This was a breakthrough film and it remains one.Final note: Watch the crane shot near the end as the 707 is recalled to its perch at the terminal. The camera glides down and allows the nose of the airplane to fill the screen, jigging slowly on its springs, its windshields like eyes, its bulbous black radar dome like the nose on the face of a clown, a hideous and frightening clown. It's a magnificent shot.",Bullitt
14,Tweekums,A '60s cop classic,9,25 June 2018,"This classic '60s cop film is set in San Francisco where Lt Frank Bullitt has been asked to guard Johnny Ross. Ross was previously in 'The Organisation' in Chicago but is now planning to give evidence to a senate committee. Things go wrong very quickly; a hitman strikes leaving Ross and a policeman critically injured. Walter Chalmers, the ambitious local politician who saw the committee meeting as a way to launch himself of a national stage is furious that his key witness may be unavailable, makes it clear that Bullitt will take the fall if Ross doesn't testify. Bullitt sets about trying to find those behind the attack.'Bullitt' is best remembered for the iconic car chase through the streets of San Francisco... it wasn't the first film to feature a car chase but for a while afterwards it seemed that every cop film had to include a chase scene... and this one remains one of the best with Bullitt's Ford Mustang growling as he pursues the villains Dodge Charger. The film may be known for that one scene but it is just a small part of a fine film. It may not be as action packed as films made these days but the details feel real which keep it gripping. Steve McQueen is on top form as Frank Bullitt and Robert Vaughn is solid as Chalmers. When we learn the identity of the person behind the attack it proved to be quite a surprise... all I'll say about it is; I didn't see it coming until just before the big reveal... by which time we'd been shown plenty of clues. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre; it is still fresh fifty years on.",Bullitt
15,ma-cortes,Nice detective story makes great use of San Francisco streets and features one of star Steve McQueen's best screen performances,7,28 September 2014,"Thrilling and suspenseful film that has one of the best chases in cinema history . Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen who based his character on San Francisco Homicide Inspector Dave Toschi, made famous for his work on the Zodiac killings) is an antihero police detective , he is an instinctive cop with his own methods operating in San Francisco . Frank is an individualistic man and uses questionable methods similarly to ""Harry Callahan"" Clint Eastwood , as a type renegade cop who smells a rat when his efforts to guard a key person are suspiciously thwarted . A politician (Robert Vaughn , he has repeatedly said that his performance in this film is his best and contains the work he is most proud of) commissions him to protect a fugitive pursued by the Chicago Crime Syndicate . Bullitt senses some strange behind assignment to guard criminal witness . However , Frank can not avoid being killed . Along the way Frank and helper (Don Gordon) find corruption , violence , killings , car pursuits and many other things until find out the key of the mystery. Taut police/action/drama film that over time has become a cult movie . The plot is simple but very well paced , though sometimes results to be slow moving and a bit dated now . A simple script is added all the ingredients of the genre : tough , two-fisted cop , politicized fiscal , twisted intrigue , troublesome girlfriend and a lot of murders . Exciting action scenes , especially in now-classic car pursuit , it lasts 10 minutes and 53 seconds, one of the screen's all-time best , being still a corker , including academy Award winning editing by Frank Keller. Traditionally, car chases are filmed by second units but Peter Yates insisted on doing it himself , this was partly because he knew that Steve McQueen would be performing a lot of the stunts himself . Bullit (1968) enjoyed a freedom of movement around the city that would be hard to come by today, including giving up an entire hospital wing for filming, closing down multiple streets for three weeks for a car chase scene and taking over San Francisco International Airport at night. Steve McQueen gives a very good as well as definitive interpretation as Frank Bullit and the film has good pace. He did his own stunts , in fact Steve McQueen made a point to keep his head near the open car window during the famous chase scene so that audiences would be reassured that it was he, not a stunt man, who was driving . Steve McQueen was very keen to do as many of his own stunts as possible. He had been hugely embarrassed to admit that it was not him performing the celebrated motorbike stunt in The great escape (1963). There is a good secondary gallery such as Norman Fell, Jacqueline Bissett , Robert Duvall , Robert Vaughn and Simon Oakland . Atmospheric cinematography by William A Fraker is accompanied by a marvelous jazzy soundtrack by Lalo Schiffrin.This entertaining film was well directed by Peter Yates, appointing the accent on twisted intrigue and noisy action and being the first film produced under Steve McQueen's production company, Solar. Director Peter Yates was personally selected for this movie by Steve McQueen because Yates had filmed a realistic car chase a year earlier through the streets of London in Robbery (1967). Peter was a good craftsman , being mostly known for ¨Bullit¨ , the success of this venture prompted Yates to remain in America, adapting himself to a variety of other genres, though continuing to be preoccupied with action subjects . Never a prolific director, Yates subsequently made only a few more films . His best films include the stylish and ingenious caper comedy Hot Rock (1972); the underwater adventure Deep (1977), based on the novel and screenplay by Peter Benchley; and the quirky coming-of-age comedy Breaking away (1979). For the latter, Yates received simultaneous Oscar nominations as Best Director and Best Producer and the enjoyably old-fashioned comedy Curtain call (1998), starring Michael Caine and Maggie Smith as a couple of theatrical ghosts. He was nominated again for a more cerebral 'actor's piece', The dresser (1983), starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay , based on a play about an ageing stage actor and his long-standing assistant. It was followed by a flop titled Eleni (1985) with John Malkovich . Most memorable, perhaps, were the courtroom thriller Suspect (1987), the political drama House de Carroll Street (1988) .",Bullitt
16,moonspinner55,You cannot argue its sleekness and style...but the film is so laconic it is muted,6,13 June 2010,"Robert L. Pike's book ""Mute Witness"" becomes snazzy-looking crime drama propelled by chases, screeching tires, the hilly streets of San Francisco and, of course, Steve McQueen as a police detective so inherently cool he doesn't need to do much but walk (and drive) in front of the camera (it's not exactly acting, per se, but McQueen does cut an undeniable presence). The plot is utterly routine: McQueen's Lt. Frank Bullitt is assigned to keep watch over a witness on the take from Chicago mobsters, who winds up dead; Bullitt feels he's being duped by the crooked police force and a dirty US Senator. The famous car chase midway through is astonishingly well-edited and photographed, and Steve is moody and quiet in a forceful way, but the airport showdown takes its time. Director Peter Yates gets awfully introspective at key moments--and when he does, the picture practically goes mute (his star is low-keyed and laconic as it is). ""Bullitt"" shows off a sleek style that turns audiences on, yet it's a workmanlike exercise most of the way, leading to a curiously thoughtful tag. **1/2 from ****",Bullitt
17,blanche-2,Steel true,7,30 September 2015,"Steve McQueen stars in ""Bullitt,"" from 1968, directed by Peter Yates. This was at the peak of McQueen's career; sadly, he would be dead just 12 years later.This film has an interesting history. It is based on a book where the detective never solves a case and eats ice cream. Originally the property was for Spencer Tracy; after his death, it went to McQueen. McQueen based his character on the detective who solved the Zodiac murders.Bullitt (McQueen) is given the assignment to guard an important witness, but the witness is shot and later dies. He makes the powers that be believe that the man is still alive, while he searches for the killer. We see very soon that Bullitt is one determined guy, perhaps like Dirty Harry, only this guy doesn't talk much. He pays no attention to his superiors or a politician (Robert Vaughan) who needs the witness in court the next day.Strong and silent, this role fits Steve McQueen's persona to a T. With very little dialogue, he manages to convey his determination and resolve. The top moment is the unbelievable car chase, with McQueen apparently doing most of his own driving. His wife at that time was so upset that she asked the director to use a stunt man. When McQueen came to work and saw the stunt man in his car, he was livid. When driving, McQueen kept his face close to the window so the audience could see his was driving.The film is low on violence, and it also feels European, I suppose because of the director. It moves a little slowly especially by today's standards.The airplane scenes are a reminder of how big the seats used to be and how different flying was back then. One of the best parts for me was seeing McQueen in the turtleneck and jacket, which was all the rage back in the '60s and early '70s. One day, my roommate and I were talking about a guy who dressed like that, saying how great he always looked. There was a friend of ours, a man, with us. The next day he showed up in a turtleneck and jacket and we had to bite our lips. Guess we were more influential than we thought. Not as influential as Steve McQueen, though. You can still see bits of his acting in some actors today. He worked hard, left a great legacy, and he underwent experimental treatment for mesothelioma so he wanted to live for his children. The great cast includes Simon Oakland, Norman Fell, Jacqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, and Robert Duvall.",Bullitt
18,JohnHowardReid,Best Film Editing?,8,17 December 2016,"What should have been – and often is – a good action thriller, is somewhat vitiated by a script that is meandering, muddled and confused. It wasn't until I read the synopsis that I found out who the Robert Vaughn character was supposed to be. And what place Jacqueline Bissett has in the film (save to introduce periodic doses of phony philosophy) is as mysterious as the opening credits. Generally speaking, the acting of all concerned is no more than competent. If anything, Steve McQueen is even more surly than usual. The movie's chief assets are William Fraker's fine color photography, some terrific action scenes, and the director's extensive use of intriguing San Francisco locations. To my surprise, the film's editor, Frank P. Keller, won an Academy Award for his work on this film. This was obviously no fluke, because Keller also received the annual award for Best Editing from his peers in the American Cinema Editors.

Are we dealing with the underworld or what?

20,Coventry,Prototype and role model for a whole decade of Poliziotesschi favorites!,7,30 August 2018,"Admittedly, I'm doing this in the wrongful and reversed order. For years already, I've been watching and reviewing Italian cop thrillers (the so-called ""Poliziotesschi""), and only now I'm commenting on the classics that directly influenced the birth of this fabulous sub-genre. My heart belongs to the Italian Poliziotesschi, with all the ""Roma Violenta"" or ""Napoli Spara"" thrillers directed by Umberto Lenzi and starring Maurizio Merli, but I'm also realistic enough to reckon that these movies never even would have existed if it weren't for a handful of Hollywood milestones such as ""Dirty Harry"", ""The French Connection"" and this ""Bullitt"". Perhaps even more than the other titles, ""Bullitt"" is THE prototypic tough cop thriller, and Steve McQueen was the role model for all future streetwise police detectives that disobey their superiors and revert to unorthodox methods to bring justice. ""Bullitt"" is an incredibly simple and straightforward movie, but that's probably what makes it so great as well. The titular hero, first name Frank, is a good detective and an amiable human being. He respects his colleagues and treats the people that are part of his investigation with respect, whereas he ignores the supposedly prominent authority figures that put pressure on him. Bullitt and his partner are assigned to protect a key witness who fled from Chicago to San Francisco to testify in a trial against the mafia. The witness dies in the hospital, following a professional hit that also cost the life of Bullitt's partner, but nothing is what it seems, and our hero decides to ""confiscate"" the corpse until he finds out who really was the man he needed to protect. The car chase is iconic and imitated numerous times, but honestly, it's far from being the greatest I've ever seen. The San Francisco setting, with its uphill and downhill lanes and streetcars, makes it more spectacular, but the Italian car chases of the 70s are far more virulent and guerilla-styled. However, this was one of the first car chases, as there are a lot of ""firsts"" in this landmark film.",Bullitt

23,Scarecrow-88,Bullitt,10,10 February 2016,"While obviously recognized for its incredible chase scene through the streets of San Francisco (which some believe was the reason it won the Oscar for best Film Editing and brought director Yates acclaim), I think Bullitt also perseveres for nearly 50 years essentially on the smooth operator cool of McQueen and the use of location shooting bringing 1968 to life. The use of camera as it follows characters and action is impeccable. The green Mustang as badass as it is, and the way it roars as McQueen chases after the bad guys. The way the dialogue seems so authentic and texturely rich. The twisty plot as a supposed mob witness of ""the organization"" is revealed to be someone he's not (and how McQueen discovers that in fact this was a ruse perpetrated by the very man he was supposed to protect), and his face being the target of the shotgun is particularly significant to this. Bullitt maintains its appeal thanks to how McQueen goes about his work, his love life (with the stunning Jacqueline Bisset who would work for Yates again in The Deep, looking even more yummy opposite Nick Nolte), and the investigation as it provides much needed answers which allow him to thwart the efforts of a politician (Robert Vaughn, laying on the smarm to the point you want to punch him in the face) wanting to pin a murder on his ""negligence"". The movement of a body supposed to be the mob informant, a trip to San Mateo, and a close call at an airport; McQueen will jump through hoops to get his answers. Slick production whose location shooting allows the film to breathe, soothing jazz score by Lalo Shifrin that seems to define the era for which it is background, and the authenticity of the life as a cop (the violence and death that comes with the job day after day; it even affects a cop's romantic existence) all give Bullitt an iconic status if richly deserves. Superb cast (Simon Oakland as McQueen's superior Captain, Don Gordon as McQueen's partner, Robert Duvall as a cabbie, Norman Fell as another Captain causing McQueen problems due to his ties with Vaughn, and Vic Tayback as ""Ross"") top to bottom only adds further value to the film. Fascinating ties to real life San Fran cop Dave Toschi (who worked the Zodiac killings) through McQueen's desire to realistically portray his role after a model cop just enhances matters even more. Vaughn makes for a real antagonist, almost a hindrance to McQueen's investigation to further his own career. The humiliation of Vaughn when McQueen proves a revelation about the man he was assigned to protect, killed after leaving the latch to the Hotel Danube door unlocked, is particularly a satisfying moment.",Bullitt

A slimy politician, Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) is breathing down his neck and making things very difficult for him. Will he have him thrown off the force before he finds the killers?I've been hearing for years that this is a great movie. Seeing it, I can't see why people think that. Plotwise this is nothing new and the movie is slow and needlessly convoluted. By the end I was totally bored. Scenes come out of nowhere--at one point there's a little fight that Bullitt has with his girlfriend (a stunningly beautiful Jacqueline Bissett) where she complains to him about his acceptance of violence...but there's absolutely no lead up to this scene and the resolution is handled badly. It seems to come from different movie!There are some good things here--it's well-directed by Peter Yates who makes beautiful use of San Francisco locations; the now-famous car chase is still exciting and well-directed and edited; McQueen isn't as bad as he usually is (his face actually changes expression once or twice); Bissett is badly used--but at least she's there; Simon Oakland gives a good performance as a police chief and Vaughn is excellent. It's also fun to see Robert Duvall (with hair as a cab driver), Norman Fell (another police chief) and Georg Stanford Brown (as a doctor) in small roles.I'm giving this a 6 and that's mostly for Vaughn, direction and the car chase.

Obviously influenced The French Connection (1971), Dirty Harry (1972) and recently, Heat (1995). William Friedkin, Don Siegel, and Michael Mann owe royalties to the one that was First. While not maybe foremost, actually the aforementioned are arguably better, it started a New Wave of Cop Movies that is still with us.It is a sleek and sombre affair with Scenes of boring Police Procedures intertwined and cut with Suspense and Chases. A lot of Chases. When the Violence erupts it is bloody and hurtful. It has a rhythm similar to reality. A lot of the mundane and uneventful peppered with moments of Drama and Intensity.The powerful screen Presence of Steve McQueen and Robert Vaughn are present here. Their Characters seem real and emotionless, considering their Professions, they both approach it with a concerned detachment and ""for the jobs sake"" cool resolve. They are opposing and polarized but they are in their way both of the same determinate.This Movie, most famous for the car chase, ironically, works well not because of that but it seemed to opened up the Genre, not with explosive excitement and velocity, but in a calculated combination of intensity and verisimilitude.",Bullitt

On the whole it is much more cerebral than the average cop-based thriller and reminiscent of the Doona Leon school of detective story with a strong moral stance rather than wallowing in violence.

28,zardoz-13,Cool Is Another Name for Steve McQueen!!!,10,22 January 2015,"Peter Yates' ""Bullitt"" qualifies as one of Steve McQueen's iconic roles. McQueen is at the top of his game in this San Francisco based police thriller about a insubordinate detective assigned to keep a mob informant alive until District Attorney Walter Chamlers (Robert Vaughn) can get him to testify before the grand jury. Nothing about ""Bullitt"" turns out to be simple. The more Lieutenant Bullitt looks into the case, the more he finds complications. Of course, anybody who loves taut auto chases must see ""Bullitt."" McQueen's wife divorced in partially because he drove the Mustang in this harrowing chase through the hills of the City by the Bay. The two moments in ""Bullitt"" that overshadow the landmark chase are the instant that the bag falls from the laundry chute and smacks the hallway floor and earlier when the gunmen burst into the hotel and shoot the witness. McQueen is stylist with his closely-cropped hair and his casual attire. I don't think that Hollywood could stage a finale at an airport like Yates did here. This was Peter Yates' big break after he made ""Robbery"" about the great British train robbery. Reportedly, McQueen hired Yates on the basis of ""Robbery.""

29,Boba_Fett1138,Late '60's movie in '70's style.,8,22 March 2007,"Many movies from the late '60's can also be put in the '70's category, in terms of its style. ""Bullitt"" is just as raw and realistic as any other '70's movie from the same genre. For its time period especially this movie is a very 'cool' movie to watch, the reason why this movie is being regarded as being one of the coolest ever made.I totally love the style of ""Bullitt"". It's raw and straight-forward but above all also realistic. Nothing in the movie feels forced. this is due to the way the story is written and told and it's dialogs and the actors that deliver the lines. The movie is not as exaggeratedly fast paced as with today's genre movies too often is the case and instead is toned down, to give the movie an overall realistic feeling.Also the wonderful directing by Peter Yates provides the movie with its very own suiting atmosphere and style. There are some very style-full directed sequences in this movie.Best known of those sequence is of course the car chase, through San Fransico, with the famous Mustang in it. What I perhaps like best about the chase is its build up. No way that without the build the whole chase would had been so thrilling and adrenaline pumping as it is now. The Lalo Schifrin score, Steve McQueen's Mustang slowly appearing in the bad guy's back mirror, then the sudden burnout from the bad guys and the chase begins. All adds perfectly to the build up of the actual chase. I think that it's also an absolute great thing that the chase itself has no music or any lines spoken in it, just the sound of the car's engines and spinning wheels. It let the actor's facial expressions and the sound tell the excitement and danger of the whole situation. The chase itself uses many fantastic camera-positions and editing (Oscar win), that also would influence many other later chase sequences. Of course the city of San Fransisco is also the perfect backdrop for a car chase sequence, with its steep hills. The scene is deservedly so a classic. Even those who have never seen ""Bullitt"" knows its car chase.But just like with ""North by Northwest"" is the case, it's most famous sequence is the crop-duster sequence but I like the end sequence on Mount Rushmore even better. Same thing goes for ""Bullitt"". It's most famous sequence is the car chase but I like the end sequence on the airport even better. It's tense, dark, realistic and it overall is a great climax that suits the movie perfectly. The opening sequence of the movie is also one definitely worth mentioning.The story itself is a great typical cop-movie story, that is solidly constructed and features some nice twists (not what you think).The movie is greatly carried by Steve McQueen, who shows why he was nicknamed the King Of Cool. He really was the greatest and coolest movie icon of the '60's. He plays the character raw and tough but never without a sense for honor and honesty. It makes his character both tough and likable. The movie also has a great supporting cast with Robert Vaughn (who still basically looked the same then as he does now), Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Duvall in a small (and insignificant) and early role.An essential '60's viewing and not just because of its famous car chase.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bullitt
30,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I never had it this good,8,16 May 2010,"This is the original tough cop flick. McQueen with his steely blue eyes, intensity and energy make the lead role immensely cool(and his performance is right on the money), and it is no accident that this has been imitated a ton since(and is, to this day). All the clichés that we are familiar with today made their first(or one of the earliest, at least) appearance here; ""is this my case?"", the interrogating technique he uses, the ""stopping at nothing to solve it and bring the perp to justice"", and all of it was loved and made it into an extremely entertaining film, hence them being used so many times that we today consider them to be ""typical"", and ""edgy"" shows attempting to put a new spin on it. This is engaging throughout, and the chases(including the famous car one, and yes, it is as awesome as you've heard, it holds up nicely and it's undoubtedly a large part of the reason such is so popular today, it was realized how amazing something like that could be) help make it exciting. At the times that this goes for suspense, it achieves it masterfully. The plot is great, if arguably not devoid of holes. I would say that this is about style before substance, and in that regard, it is excellent. Editing and cinematography(with a couple of interesting angles) are marvelous, if the cutting could be tighter here and there. The acting is solid for the main cast(the girlfriend is a tad weak in one instance... what a set of legs on her, though), and the characters are well-written and credible. Music in this is impossibly smooth and fitting. There is a little bloody(not terribly gory or graphic) violence, some disturbing content and infrequent moderate language in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition comes with an interesting and informational commentary track by director Peter Yates, two feature-length documentaries and one ten minute one(all three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site) and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it(especially its star) and/or action movies from the period. 8/10",Bullitt

He's tasked with protecting a high caliber witness from Chicago but runs into problems right away. Bullitt (McQueen) finds himself fighting three fights: one against the pushy arrogant senator, one against the criminals set upon killing the witness, and one against his girlfriend who is (oddly) upset with his career choice.For me the movie Bullitt has a different reason for being interesting.

He's constantly one-upped and outsmarted by the men he's supposed to be keeping an eye on. But he looks awfully good being a bad cop, except for those moments when he parades around in god-awful pajamas.

Robert Vaughn plays the slick, compromising politician while Simon Oakland appears as Bullitt's superior. Don Gordon is on hand as Bullitt's partner while Georg Stanford Brown plays a doctor. Robert Duvall has a small role.This was the obvious inspiration of the Dirty Harry franchise and other Eastwood cop flicks but, unlike those amped-up films, ""Bullitt"" is decidedly realistic, crackling with authenticity with its to-the-letter depictions of police, hospital and morgue procedures. The movie is decidedly low-key, respecting the intelligence of the viewer. Actually, it's SO realistic and mundane that it'll likely turn-off a lot of Dirty Harry fans. I suggest using the subtitles so you can keep track of who's who and what's going on.The movie draws you into its believable suspense with no less than three cat-and-mouse sequences. The first one is on foot at a hospital; the second is the iconic 7-minute car chase on the streets of San Francisco (which 1988's ""The Dead Pool"" paid homage to in a semi-spoof scene); and the third is another foot-chase at the airport, including the runways, which is the climax. Take note, by the way, of the green Volkswagon Beetle, which is repeatedly seen during the car chase.""Bullitt"" also works as a period piece of Big City, USA, 1967 (when the film was shot).

Stikll, it is called a classic and finally I picked it up on Blu Ray to give it a try.I think no-one will agree with me but I didn't like it very much. It's really outdated and extremely slow. The chasing scene at the airport takes ages and the beginning doesn't go really fast too. The only thing I did like and what made this flick notorious is the car chase between a Mustang and a Charger. But if you just watch the editing of the chase even that is full of continuity mistakes. Just have a look at the Volkswagen Beatle they came across, how many times did they pass that one??? And the damage towards the Charger isn't correct too.Not my cup of tea and people who know me do know I'm not fond of flicks from that era except a few, just see Vanishing Point (1971), that delivered the goods on all parts. Maybe for 98% out there this is a cult classic, for me it was a chase, euh, race against boredom, except for the muscle car race.

40,JamesHitchcock,Reviving the Crime Thriller,8,16 September 2015,"The 1960s were not the greatest era in the history of the American crime film. The old film noir style had come to an end in the late fifties, at least in America itself- Orson Welles's ""Touch of Evil"" from 1958 is sometimes regarded as marking the end of the line- but nothing equally distinctive had come along to replace it. There were occasional cop or private eye dramas, but few of them proved particularly memorable. ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is one of the better ones, but even that is really more style than substance.""Bullitt"" from 1968 can be seen as marking the beginning of a revival of the genre. (It shared its star, Steve McQueen, with ""Thomas Crown""). Frank Bullitt, a detective with the San Francisco Police Department, is given the task of arranging protection for Johnny Ross, a key witness who is due to give evidence to a Senate Sub-Committee investigation into organised crime. Ross is a defector from the Mafia, here referred to simply as ""The Organisation"", who want him dead before he can testify. Bullitt appears to have failed when two gunmen burst into Ross's hotel room, seriously wounding both him and the policeman guarding him. Bullitt believes, however, that there may be more to this attempt than meets the eye and begins to investigate further.Rather unusually, the film did not give rise to a franchise; this was to be McQueen's only outing as Bullitt. It did, however, give rise to a whole new genre, the ""tough cop"" thriller and inspired the ""Dirty Harry"" and ""French Connection"" franchises, starring Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman respectively. Even the ageing John Wayne got in on the act with ""Brannigan"" and ""McQ"". Its influence can also be seen in later crime series such as the ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" films. Its most influential scene is undoubtedly that iconic switchback car chase through the streets of San Francisco, much imitated but never excelled, and lasting over ten minutes.Bullitt himself is very different to some later cinema tough cops, quieter and less flamboyant than, say, Dirty Harry or Bruce Willis's character in ""Die Hard"". I cannot imagine him shouting ""Come on, punk, make my day!"", still less ""Yippee-ki-yay, mother******!"" He is a hard man but a decent one, troubled by the fact that his job brings him into contact with human nature at its worst and by the effects this is having on his relationship with his girlfriend Cathy. He only draws and uses his gun once, and it is notable that, although this is a film about violent crime, the actual amount of violence shown on screen is considerably less than in many ""tough cop"" movies. This relative lack of violence, however, does not equate to a lack of excitement, and director Peter Yates is able to generate plenty of tension, much but by no means all of it coming in in the car chase scene. This sense of tension is often heightened by Lalo Schifrin's very effective jazz-based score.This is one of McQueen's finest acting performances. His character's inner conflicts are expressed less through dialogue than through McQueen's expressions, gestures and body language, which makes for a much more subtle interpretation. If the film has a weakness, it is perhaps that there are no supporting performances of similar quality; the villains are all rather anonymous, apart from Robert Vaughn's Walter Chalmers, an ambitious politician trying to use Ross's testimony to further his own career.The film won one Academy Award for Best Film Editing, doubtless because of the car chase scene, put together from footage shot over several weeks. It also received a nomination for Best Sound, but was not otherwise recognised by the Academy, although it was a success at the box office and was generally praised by the critics. Today it is perhaps held in even greater esteem than it was in 1968, and has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, a recognition of its status as one of the most influential crime films of all time. 8/10",Bullitt
41,MovieAddict2016,Fun if outdated,7,24 December 2004,"""Bullitt"" is, of course, most famous for its revolutionary car chase and it still packs a punch. Unfortunately, the film itself is somewhat less of a thrill - it's quite outdated and although Steve McQueen's performance is legendary and perhaps even iconic, many of the actors are not very impressive and the plot isn't anything special.That said, it is a good movie and will always be remembered for its car chase more so than other elements. It isn't a great movie nor is it a classic but it is fun and worth viewing and Robert Duvall's brief performance is a must-see for any film buff.4/5",Bullitt
42,disdressed12,Steve McQueen is Bullitt,6,29 June 2009,"for some reason,i had the impression this was going to be an action packed car chase movie.but it is really more of a police procedural than anything.there is one chase scene,which was fairly exciting,but more brief than it thought it would be.it did offer some point of view shots from the drivers,so that was kinda cool.but mostly there's a lot of talking and some sedate action,people walking around,that sort of thing.yet i actually liked the movie.Steve McQueen(Lt.Frank Bullit)is so low key and laid back,yet for some reason hard to take you eyes off of.i wouldn't consider this a classic,but it was watchable and it does pass the time.it's not for action junkies,though.otherwise,it's not half bad.For me,Bullitt is a 6/10",Bullitt
43,bensonmum2,"""You believe what you want. You work your side of the street, and I'll work mine.""",8,25 November 2015,"As my rating indicates, I love Bullitt. I think it's mostly a brilliant movie. Other reviewers have mentioned more eloquently than I can everything I love about the movie - the uber-cool Steve McQueen; the editing, cinematography, and direction; Lalo Schifrin's score - particularly the title sequence; the car chase; the acting; Robert Vaughn (an actor who usually annoys the pants off me); and the brilliant San Frnacisco locations. I'm not going to go into detail on most of this other than a bit about McQueen. I think a lot of people (including me) remember McQueen for being the larger-than-life badass. But watching Bullitt the other night, I was reminded of just what an outstanding actor he was. There are scenes and moments in Bulllitt where McQueen is able to do more with just a nod or a look than most actors could with a dozen pages of dialogue. McQueen was often the center of attention on a screen-full of actors without ever opening his mouth. He had a real presence. He was a real actor.There are three other things I want to mention in this comment: First, there is one plot point that really gets under my skin and I consider it a real weakness in the script. Looking at the apartment selected to keep the informant, Bullitt immediately notices the windows and the security weaknesses they provide. Why doesn't he demand a new location? Or, better yet, being Bullitt, why doesn't he just take it upon himself to find a new location? Leaving things to chance is a contradiction to Bullitt's character.Second, I will admit there are some pacing problems in Bullitt. I don't agree with other commnetors who say the film is ""boring"". It may not have an unrealistic explosion every 10 seconds, but that doesn't make it boring. What you call boring, I call realistic. I get a kick out of most of the scenes where Bullitt is just standing and watching what's going on around him. I find McQueen that watchable. What I'm talking about are a few scenes that are completely unnecessary to the script. A slightly tighter script, with 10 or so minutes cut, might have made a good movie a great movie.Third, Jacqueline Bisset really has no point in the movie. She's in some of those scenes I mentioned in the last paragraph that I felt unnecessary to the plot. She doesn't add a thing to McQueen's character or our feelings toward him. I would normally praise any movie just for casting Bisset, but here, she's wasted.Despite the weaknesses, a strong 8/10 from me.",Bullitt
44,gridoon,Cold and overrated.,5,6 January 2001,"Yet another ""classic"" that doesn't justify its fame. Although not as sleep-inducing as ""The French Connection"", ""Bullitt"" is nonetheless a boring film. In fact, it may be one of the most unthrilling thrillers you'll ever see. Even the famous car chase sequence has lost most of its impact. Steve Mcqeen, likable as he is, has no character to play here - he is just an indistinct, routine Cop. The whole movie is equally run-of-the-mill. (**)",Bullitt
45,sol1218,A Bullitt For Steve,9,16 March 2004,"*****SPOILERS****** Even though the movie ""Bullitt"" is known for it's legendary car chase scene, this in 1968 when everything was done for real not in a studio with computer enhanced imagery, the movie is also a very fine crime/drama straight out of todays headlines and has a very good and brainy plot too. Senator Walter Chalmers is holding a special Senate Commission on Organized Crime in America in San Francisco and has a very important witness Johnny Ross, Pat Renella, coming from Chicago to testify. Chalmers Wants to make sure that Ross is protected from the mob who beside testifying against it has also stolen $2,000,000.00 dollars from them and they want him dead and will go to any lengths to get him. Ross is assigned a unit from the SFPD headed by Let. Frank Bullitt, Steve McQueen, for around the clock protection at an undisclosed hotel. Just before Ross entered the hotel he made a number of Phone calls one was to a hotel in San Mateo Calif. Later back in his hotel room with Sgt. Stanton, Carl Reindel guarding him Ross slides open the lock on the door and just then two men enter the hotel room and blast both Ross and Sgt. Stanton away; at the hospital Sgt. Stanton survives but Ross dies on the operating table.Let. Bullitt wisely decides to keep Ross' death secret from Senator Chalmers as well as the media by having Ross' body put on ice in the hospital morgue, unidentified, under a John Doe. With Ross' death kept under cover Let. Bullitt checks out Ross' phone calls, before he entered the hotel room, and finds that the call to the San Mateo hotel was to a woman who registered under the named of Dorothy Simmons. With the Senate Commission hearing the next day Bullitt begins to realize that this dead hood Johnny Ross may not the person that he seems to be. As Let. Bullitt gets closer to the truth about the whole Ross business his life becomes endangered by the two killers, Paul Genge and Bill Hickman, who killed Johnny Ross in his hotel room. This sets the scene for the thrilling and exciting car chase that the movie is noted for. Setting him up for an ambush on a deserted San Francisco street Bullitt turns the tables on the killers by backtracking and then surprises and chases them into a hot corner. We have the two killers and Let. Bullitt flooring the gas peddle and tearing up the roads and highway in and around San Francisco and the Bay Area. The exciting car chase comes to an end when, after trying to shoot at Bullitt's car with a shotgun, the killers auto loses control and smashes into a gas station with both of the killers ending dead and burned to a crisp .Back at the police station Bullitt starts to check out the mysterious Mrs. Simmons, the woman who Ross called before he was killed, at her hotel room in San Mateo and finds her murdered. Looking at Mrs. Simmons' luggage Let. Bullitt and the police find out that she was really a Mrs. Renick and was scheduled to leave San Francisco ,with her husband Edward, on a plane trip to Italy? whats going on here? Checking Mrs.Renick aka Simmons husbands passport photo Bullitt realizes that Johnny Ross who was killed at the hotel room was really her husband Edward Renick a car dealer from Chicago with no mob connections. Renick must have been paid off by the real Johnny Ross, Felice Orlandi, to impersonate him with Ross taking Renick's passport and identity and checking out of the country and away from the law and the mob who were both looking for him! Ross must have also double-crossed both Renick and his wife by having them murdered. With the real Johnny Ross now heading for the San Francisco International Airport to make his getaway Let. Frank Bullitt is the only one who has a chance to stop him and as it gets closer for Ross' flight to take off for Italy the chances of him getting caught are getting slimmer by the minute. Terrific police/action/drama with an ending at the airport, thats as good as the great car chase seen earlier in the film, that left everyone gasping. Also good in the film is Jackie Bisset as Let. Frank Bullitt's girlfriend Cathy who had trouble accepting Frank's job as a policeman especially by seeing up front and personal, the murdered Mrs. Simmons/Renick, what that job did to him as well as what it was doing to her her by living with him.",Bullitt
46,theowinthrop,Still the greatest car chase sequence in any thriller ever made,10,20 September 2007,"I have found in my life that few films hit me properly from the start. BULLITT (which I first saw at College) was one of them. It cemented my high opinion of the cinematic acting ability of Steve McQueen, and it has always struck me as one of the best police ""procedural"" films in terms of the way the investigation is handled by McQueen's titled character. But the chase, at the center of the film, is the highpoint that made me love the film. And oddly enough, Director Peter Yates manages to somewhat top it with the second chase through the runways of an airport at the film's conclusion.McQueen works under Simon Oakland as a detective in the San Francisco Police Department. He lives with his artistic girlfriend Jacqueline Bissett. One day he is one of the detectives assigned to protect an important witness against the mob that is supposed to be presented to the anti-crime commission by millionaire/would-be politician Robert Vaughn. The witness is set up in a motel with policemen as guards. There should be no problem. Yet two mob hit men manage to crash in, wound the police (one fatally) and kill the witness. McQueen is told of this and goes to the hospital. He has little use for Vaughn (an arrogant creep if ever there was one), or his stooge central police connection Norman Fell. His sole interest now is to find the killers and figure out what happened. He does so by hiding the fact that the witness died - and spreading the word that the police are now redoubling efforts to protect the witness. While Vaughn fumes and Fell threatens Oakland and McQueen, the latter continues the investigation, aided by cabby Robert Duvall (in an early role). This leads to the chase sequence, which starts with us being aware that the cab and then McQueen's car are being followed by a car with the two hit men in it. The beginning of the sequence is mild, as we see them driving after McQueen, but the turning point is when they have apparently lost him, and he reappears following their car. Then they go into the outskirts of San Francisco, and the roads from the city, with the added threats of other vehicles and of a twelve gage sawed - off shotgun one of the hit men uses.There are nice procedural moments throughout: McQueen seeing the set up of the now closed crime scene at the motel, with ribbons tracing the trajectories of the bullets; the investigation of a dead woman's trunk and belongings to figure out why she was killed; a sequence with a 1968 version (possibly a first) of a fax machine of that period - a favorite scene of mine because it knocks the props out of both Vaughn's arrogance and Fell's belief that his own future in the police is made. And the issues of the effect of the job on McQueen is not forgotten either. Bissett witnesses the aftermath of some violence, and confronts him on how he can stand it every day.I do not think any other crime and cop thriller ever hit the notes so naturally and perfectly together. The cast helps from McQueen down to the two hit men (silent roles for stunt men). Witness too that Simon Oakland plays a nice character for once, and does well with his part (look at the scene between him and a threatening Vaughn outside the church Oakland is taking his family to on Sunday). Vaughn is great as a smarmy, selfish piece of work who sees people as pawns to play with for his own benefit. McQueen finally tells him off, but does it effectively and without histrionics.This is one of those films that just never ages.",Bullitt
47,Robert_duder,Sometimes a classic makes me scratch my head,4,4 September 2015,"Usually when I finally sit down to watch what is considered a classic for the first time, I am floored that it took me so long to see it and I love it. Gone With The Wind, Harvey, Casablanca...I waited a long time to see them for the first time. Same with Bullitt and honestly I think this is only the second Steve McQueen movie I've seen after The Great Escape, another classic I loved immediately. I was expecting Bullitt to be this intense, gritty action film with that iconic car chase that I've heard about. What I got instead was a very slow, dry, almost boring ""mystery."" No one gives a performance worth remembering at all and while the car chase scene is decent compared to everything else, at least its some action, its nothing to write home about. I suppose for its time it was impressive but car chases now are a dime a dozen and there are so many better and more intense ones done. Bullitt was so slow that I literally lost interest at some point and had trouble paying attention to what was happening and I certainly had no investment in the characters or plot. The characters seem so dry and empty that I am genuinely surprised this has stood the test of time at all.Even though I don't have a lot of Steve McQueen experience...I get his persona. He was the king of cool. He was Hollywood personified and he was a smooth operator. But Bullitt just makes him look bored, egotistical, like he knows he's Steve McQueen and people are there to see him. One review I read of the film called this McQueen at his best. They have to be joking? He shows no emotion, his character is completely empty and he doesn't even want to be in the movie. The supporting cast are recognizable character actors of the time but the development on the supporting characters are absolutely terrible so they go to waste. Robert Vaughan, Jacqueline Bisset, Norman Fell and Don Gordon all show up to support the story but honestly they are completely and utterly forgettable.I'm sure the fact that I'm being so hard on a film that is considered by many to be one of the best ""action"" films of all time will bring plenty of hatred my way. I had high expectations and I don't think that's unreasonable given its reputation and it simply did not meet those expectations. Even if you look at IMDb's description of director Peter Yates they imply Bullitt is some sort of high octane car chase film. Did I watch some sort of different version? Maybe I just missed something but Bullitt was not for me. I though I knew what to expect and it wasn't anything like that. I would never tell anyone not to watch it because I'm in a minority and the film is a classic but I'd pass on it in the future. Definitely can't get on the majority train here. 4/10",Bullitt
48,Lejink,Bullitt-hard,7,22 February 2009,"Classic cop-thriller from the late 60's which arguably cemented Steve McQueen's iconic status as the toughest and most watchable Hollywood leading man from that era. Steve in fact has all the ""-onics"" going on here, principally sardonic and laconic (photogenic too if I'm stretching a point - think of that famous poster image of McQueen, is shoulder-holstered arm leaning against the wall) as he's handed a routine witness protection assignment which goes wrong and pits him as much against the almost silent ""Organisation"" hit-men on the squealer's trail as the altogether more loquacious self-serving, vainglorious politician on the make to whom he's ultimately responsible, played with sleazy élan by Robert Vaughn.From an arresting set of opening titles to the background of Lalo Schifrin's celebrated theme tune, the film cleverly puts us at Bullitt's shoulder from the start, mixing up soft focus, hand-held and a combination of different range shots, dwelling on the necessary mundane police procedures but never missing out on the opportunity to punctuate the routine with well staged action sequences.Which of course leads us to the breathless car-chase sequence around the streets of San Francisco, director Yates making great use of the city's on-location trademark rolling avenues, with great stunt driving (much of it, so the legend goes, by McQueen himself) ending up with a satisfyingly conclusive combustible finish. But there's more - the mob's hit on state witness ""Ross"" and his minder Stanton and the climax shoot-out at the airport are no less compelling and effective, particularly the real Ross's demise through a glass, smashingly! The only time Yates is really off the beat is with the casting of Jacqueline Bissett as Steve's ever-so-English girl-friend, right up there with the mis-match of Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in Hitch's ""Torn Curtain"" in the Anglo-American pairing stakes. Today, one can only see as this as a sop to the whole ""Swinging England"" scene and Hollywood's love at the time for the clipped English upper-class accent.Nevertheless their relationship (she appears to be an intellectual, fashion designer) does show that your ordinary average cop doesn't necessarily have to be a football-loving beer-swilling Neanderthal and indeed McQueen does more acting in the mute scene at the restaurant to a jazz soundtrack than in the rest of the film put together! In fact, you can quite imagine McQueen's ""Bullitt"" character getting along very well with another of his late 60's major parts, the similarly cultured, laid-back Thomas Crown, although at least he had Faye Dunaway generating real heat with him in that one.The fact that McQueen was able to project this perception of depth and intelligence in his characters with the minimal use of word or action is really what sets him apart from the pack. The question of whether he's actually acting at all is valid, but I'm a fan so there you go. Ultimately this is his movie, one which finds him at his peak and which has aged better than others of its ilk from this era (c.f. ""Coogan's Bluff"").There, got to the end without using the word ""cool"" once! Which of course this movie epitomises...",Bullitt
49,ElMaruecan82,The King of Cop Thrillers...,9,23 March 2019,"""We had the reality we wanted"" says Peter Yates in the short but insightful ""making of"" clip of the groundbreaking 1968 rhyming-with-hit ""Bullitt"".The San Francisco classic isn't much about effects rather than moods and textures, just as its hero Steve McQueen isn't about acting range but about presence. Though ""Bullitt"" consolidated McQueen's iconic status as the King of Cool and one of the undeniable charismatic personalities of Hollywood... what strikes in ""Bullitt"" defies all the conventions.I enjoyed it as an action thriller but from the perspective of someone whose father was a teenager at that time, I also enjoyed the time capsule of 1968 and was surprised to be absorbed by scenes involving a hospital staff working, a telecopy machine or personal items checked from luggage. It felt so real it was oddly gripping. This is a film that doesn't stick to reality as much as it respects it and doesn't compromise with restrictions when it comes to recreate authenticity in what could have been an ordinary cop-thriller or a vehicle to McQueen's popularity (no pun intended).And the way it works is almost hypnotic on the screen, there's no scene that feels random, no line of dialogues that feels contrived, every single moment looks in its place, this is a film that elevates minimalism to a level of efficiency rarely reached. And Steve McQueen is just perfect for the role of a cop who doesn't say much, does his job and when he feels he's being tricked, never lets any emotion overwhelm him and simply moves forward. No, this is not your vigilante in a personal crusade or a cop with a settle to record, Bullitt is a man of his job.And that's the vibes anyone would get from the film, it's a competent movie about a competent cop made by a competent director. The technical achievement is so great that it influenced the narrative and improved what was a rather straight-forward script about a witness to protect against the Mafia (called the ""Organization"") and some political implications above. The plot isn't revolutionary but its treatment is respectful to the audience's intelligence and patience in the sense that it doesn't try to be subtler or more complicated than needed, reality can be complex but to a limit.Still, I agree with Roger Ebert's comment about one scene with Bullitt's girlfriend (Jacqueline Bisset) making a speech about violence and its affect on Bullitt's callous attitude toward life. The scene feels gratuitous and misplaced in the narrative flow, it allows McQueen's role to carry more gravitas but the ending which involves a short but bloody shootout says so much more without the need of a speech, I myself was surprised by that 'intimate' moment in a film that said a lot without saying much. Like many 'mans movies', a romantic subplot almost ruined the mood.But other than that, the film is just a high-power action thriller full of suspenseful sequences, foot chases and a ten-minute car chase that influenced film-making and made the chase almost a genre requirement. Speaking for myself, I grew up with American movies being associated to the sounds of screeching tires, revving engines, crashing cars, sirens... that and Westerns. ""Bullitt"" set the template to most modern action pictures, for me only equaled by the heart-pounding car-train chase in ""The French Connection"".The chase looks fluid, riveting and efficient on screen but it demanded a painstaking precision and that eventually won the movie an Oscar for Best Editing, this is how good it was. And it was rightfully set in the middle part of the film so we could catch our breath and follow Bullitt to the rest of the investigation and moments of more bleakness and intensity set in the tarmac of an airport, which probably inspired Michael Mann's climax in ""Heat"".The merit of Bullitt is that it has a rather simple story but it tells it in a way that we never know exactly who the bad guy is. Robert Vaughn plays such a slimy and despicable politician (and he played it so well he would have deserved an Oscar nomination) that I was surprised he wasn't involved somewhere, but maybe I'm used to these convoluted plots where should lead to a big explosive twist or revelation at the end.""Bullitt"" has none of that, it trusts its material enough not to count on additional tricks, it trusts the genuine menacing atmosphere of San Francisco and the street setting, no other sets were built in the film. It trusts Steve McQueen who doesn't need to play the Cowboy Cop to be convincing, riding his mustang and being what he is, is enough. McQueen the actor plays a man doing his job in a way to inspire cheers from the audience, but he plays him as the actor doing his job, it as if he couldn't care less about it.And yet he cared. But it didn't show. And that's what coolness is about. 1968 was a great year for thrills: ""2001"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", and here's another landmark. I could say more about it but if there's anything the film taught me, is the least said, the better.",Bullitt
50,paul2001sw-1,Bullitt-speed,8,18 December 2004,"The late 1960s saw two classic, hard-boiled thrillers set in San Fransico; John Boorman's stylised 'Point Blank', and Peter Yates' 'Bullitt'. Calling your hero Bullitt might seem an unsubtle way to emphasise his macho qualities, but in fact Steve MacQueen plays him as a quiet man, not some wise-talking maverick: he does what he has to do, but takes no pleasure in his actions; and survives the roughness of his work not by becoming a monster, but simply by becoming a little less human. It's a believable portrait, and the film as a whole has a procedural feel: there are action scenes, but these are kept in their place in the overall design.Today, the film is most famous for its celebrated car chase, which makes excellent use, as indeed does the movie as a whole, of the bay area locations, but is not actually shot that excitingly: the conclusion at the airport is more original, though it roots the film in the time when it was permissible to take a loaded gun onto a plane. But overall this is still a classy film, dry, exciting and bleak, and among the very best films of its day. William Friedkin's brilliant 'The French Connection', made a short while afterwards, would appear to owe it a debt.",Bullitt
51,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mostly remembered for its standout car chase, but is actually a much slower and character-driven detective drama.",6,17 April 2018,"'Bullitt (1968)' is mostly remembered for its standout car chase sequence over the sun-drenched streets of San Francisco but, though that sequence is just as compelling and entertaining as its reputation would suggest, the rest of the picture is oddly paced and at times quite dull, though never boring, and is actually much more of a slow building character piece than a fast-paced action film. There are a number of other memorable moments, though, and the violence is fairly shocking for 60s standards, allowing Steve McQueen to provide a solid central performance in this detective drama that doesn't pull its punches but has some narrative issues and ends rather abruptly. 6/10",Bullitt
52,ThomasDrufke,Cut to the Chase,7,29 August 2015,"The few films I have seen so far from Steve McQueen have proved to me that he was not only one of the 'coolest' movie stars around at the time, but he was a damn good actor as well. Bullitt is about Frank Bullitt, a San Francisco cop who becomes entangled in a web of murders, one being the main witness in an investigation. Bullitt being the smooth guy that he is digs deep and realizes that there's much more than on the surface and suspects other officers, and in particular, one Walter Chalmers.Now I liked this movie a lot for one big reason, the chase scene. Let's be honest, Bullitt isn't a particularly special film if it weren't for that chase scene across San Francisco. The way the camera angles move from a street corner to inside the vehicle is something way ahead of its time. Movies in the 60's just didn't put the amount of effort into chase sequences as they do now so it was very impressive to watch that scene, and it most definitely still holds up. Besides that, its a mildly entertaining cop thriller that I don't think ever separated itself from just being any episode on a cop show. As much as I love McQueen in other films, he doesn't stand out as Bullitt. I know the lack of personality is what's supposed to define Bullitt but that just didn't do it for me.I will say that aside from the car chase scene, I did really like the in-pursuit on foot scenes that flooded the latter half of the film. The music is present but it doesn't overpower the fact that there is little to no dialogue in most of these types of moments. That's a tribute to how much they have faith in the camera angles and the subtle acting that the cast does. And I can appreciate that. One of the main problems I had with the film is that it just doesn't set up enough plot for me to become invested until later on. The film just kind of jumps into the police and this character 'Ross' being important. I felt that the film needed a little more exposition in order to have some of the later scenes pay off. The film does feed off more tension than I expected considering the basic premise the film carries though. And it was cool to see Robert Duvall show up briefly knowing how big he would become.+McQueen is so smooth +Car chase +Tension +Discipline and confidence from director to use little dialogue -More exposition needed -Would have liked to see more personality from the characters 7.0/10",Bullitt
53,gbill-74877,Cool,8,30 January 2018,"Most known for its classic car chase through the streets of San Francisco, Bullitt is one cool action movie. It has those moments of high energy, but at the same time, it's masterful in its pace and spare in its dialog, which is refreshing. Director Peter Yates really lets the story breathe, and by doing that puts the viewer in those moments, whether it's sifting through evidence or searching for someone in airport terminal. There is a wonderful sense of realism about the film.Steve McQueen personifies cool, and I loved how quiet his character is. He expresses himself through his eyes, and it's not until late in the movie that he allows himself to say ""Look, Chalmers, let's understand each other... I don't like you"" to the shady politician, played well by Robert Vaughn. At a time when America was highly divided, McQueen plays a cop who is not above stealing a newspaper from a dispenser, but at the same time, has a strong moral compass, resists offers to look the other way for his own gain, and does the right thing. When an underworld figure gives him information, he asks him what he can do in return, and refrains from heavy-handed muscling. As he listens to jazz in a nightclub and is inadvertently brushed in the head with a menu by a waiter, he doesn't get indignant or angry, he just smiles, in what seems like a very natural moment. He's tough without having to show how tough he is. As hippies might refer to him, he's 'The Man', and yet, he stands up to 'The Man'. And, as he's also dating Jacqueline Bisset, he's the guy every guy wishes he could be.The rest of the cast is strong, including Don Gordon as his partner and Simon Oakland as his captain. Robert Duvall makes a brief appearance as a cab driver. Georg Stanford Brown is an African-American doctor, and it was nice to see the diversity. I loved the soundtrack, which is cool jazz and used sparingly, which is refreshing. The ending is understated, and slightly ambiguous, adding to the realism. There are beautiful scenes in San Francisco, and while residents will notice the chase inexplicably jumps from the Marina district to an area near Daly City, that ride down the Taylor Street hill is fantastic. Even the cars are super cool in this film, a '68 Ford Mustang and '68 Dodge Charger. If you're in the mood for a great old-school action film, this is it.",Bullitt
54,cricketbat,Give Bullitt a shot,7,14 January 2020,"Aside from a few pacing issues, Bullitt is a strong crime drama that stands the test of time. The famous car chase scene makes it worth watching all by itself, but Steve McQueen is cool, calm, and collected as Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, and the mystery keeps you guessing. If you're a fan of police procedurals, you should give Bullitt a shot.",Bullitt
55,secondtake,The pace and visuals count for as much as McQueens quiet determination...,7,28 March 2010,"Bullitt (1968)The stunning camera-work of the opening title scenes in this movie may lead you to believe a masterpiece is at hand. But not quite. The visual confidence of the movie never lets you down, but that first impression is more telling in another way. This is a movie, directed by Peter Yates, filled with silence and nuance, and yet it lacks what someone might call content, or meaning. It's too straight forward as a simple cop/mobster/politician triangle to be revolutionary, the way say Bonnie and Clyde was revolutionary. And it's not a grand, epic film about crime and power the way the Godfather would be just a few years later.In fact, Bullitt is a bridge between earlier caper films (post-noir, but often still black and white) and later gritty movies in the 1970s like The Friends of Eddie Coyle (also directed by Yates) or Chinatown, both of which I happened to see recently. It's a strong movie with patience. There are three or four main turns to the plot, and getting from one to the next is normally a matter of watching around corners or having short conversations. If the action is limited to a footchase early on, a long car chase in the middle (of course, this is a Steve McQueen movie), and another footchase at the end, they are perfectly placed, and come with increasing anxiety and originality. McQueen has always struck me as a Paul Newman wannabe, or maybe just an actor at the fringes of being an icon. And Bullitt, because it depends so much on silent glances and moments of just thinking and brooding, makes clear that McQueen doesn't quite have the screen presence to hold that kind of intensity up. Robert Vaughn is a curious politico, having more sculptural presence than the gravitas, or evil selfishness, he seems to need. And then there is the touted Jacqueline Bisset, whose role is small, and utterly decorative. I don't know if Yates (or the audience of the time) needed her to actually act, but forget about it. Luckily, she doesn't have much to do except wear very short dresses and hang out waiting for him (in cars and beds, mostly). But such is the life of a handsome undercover cop. It's not a bad movie at all, but is underwhelming.",Bullitt
56,CuriosityKilledShawn,Not impressed!,4,11 March 2007,"Somewhere inside the overlong, 114-minute Bullitt there is a brisk 90-minute long film desperate to get out. But as it is, it's seriously overlong with nothing to sustain it. Many pointless scenes come and go with loads of long, indulgent tracking shots goose-up the running time. I almost nodded-off a few times, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about regarding this film.The paper-thin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed (he's not actually killed until about an hour later though). A local politician (Robery Vaughn, who didn't really want to do the film) acts as the token bureaucrat, standing in the way of getting things done. But getting WHAT done exactly? In 114 minutes almost NOTHING happens in this damn movie! Instead of mystery, clues, police procedure, shoot-outs and problem-solving we're treated to scene after scene of...not much. Bullitt eats food at the hospital, he goes shopping for celery and TV dinners, he hangs around with his girlfriend (a completely pointless character played by Jaqueline Bissett) and sometimes takes a passing interest in the case. About 80-minutes into this bore he is FINALLY involved in a car chase (THE car chase that everyone raves about) that 'tears up' the streets of San Francisco.I don't understand why this film has so much adoration or why all the fans proclaim it's 'the original and best', 'the one that started it all' or any other generic soundbite you can think of. There were cop movies before this, there were car chases before this. What exactly is Bullitt credited with 'starting'? A sense of being cool, calm and collected doesn't turn water into wine. Bullitt is plain, repetitive, agonizingly slow and almost completely without a plot. Don't consider me a philistine or someone who has been brainwashed by the over-edited nature of modern films where we're guaranteed and explosion every five minutes. I appreciate films from all eras and from all backgrounds. But Bullitt is just way, way overrated certainly does not deserve the high regard it's been lauded with. A real disappointment.",Bullitt
57,851222,"Great thriller, superb movie",9,25 August 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Bullitt"" (1968) is superb thriller / action movie. I was surprised when i first saw it today in 2015 - it not a typical Steve McQueen movie nor it was a ""Dirty Harry"" spin off as i was imagining it. It is a superbly serious, raw, intelligently made thriller. Look how our main hero almost never uses his gun, only when it is absolutely necessary - he uses his skills and mind first. And that should be said about movie itself - serious theme, serious hero, serious situations - it is NOT a ""Dirty Harry"", not it is ""The French Connection"" which was better in my opinion. Steve McQueen is superb here playing intelligent and determined police lieutenant who must find out what happened after his witness gets killed (no spoilers further...). There is a superb car chase scene (which is said to be best ever - but it is almost impossible to admire it in 2015 after all ""Fast&Furious"" movies but it is very well done even watching it first time in 2015) - you can clearly see the main actors behind the wheel, and this is highly rare thing, sure, now it looks may be a bit dated because if you watch it closely there are almost no other cars and absolutely no civilians in the streets. Nevertheless, i would like to go back to 1968 for a couple of hours to watch this movie at the big screen - it would be a blast from start till finish and the infamous car chase scene would be a jaw-drooping sequence - it's ALL there. Overall, ""Bullitt"" is great suspense thriller. It features great acting by all involved, especially from the start Steve McQueen which is here i thing was a cousin of Inspector Harry Callahan but not like him. It is a very suspenseful and involving from start till finish, and it is a nice character study. If i would seen it in 1968 it would be pure 10/10. If you like good realistic thrillers - ""Bullitt"" is a not to be missed if you haven't seen it yet.",Bullitt

Bisset is little more than window dressing while the rest of the cast has a number of familiar faces. It has the justifiably famous car chase through the streets of San Francisco, but the rest of the film falls short.

59,Rodrigo_Amaro,A disappointing experience. Much ado about almost nothing,4,5 July 2021,"""Bullitt"" might have been the film that set the standard for today's action pictures specially when it comes to wild and long chase sequences. It won an
Oscar for Best Editing thanks to its elaborated montage and how it was all put together. However, I don't find it much of an appealing and good film, and with two
views on different occasions I can honestly say I didn't get it.The plot revolving a San Francisco detective (Steve McQueen) trying to protect an important
criminal witness against an organization isn't any news, it's way too confusing and it's development is a disappointment of all sorts due to a ridiculous slow
pace that bores viewers; a hero who is too stiff - I love McQueen in other movies but here I find him too much passive and easily dominated by the character played by
Robert Vaughn; and sequences that run on for too long failing to generate interest.As said, I watched twice and did not like it on both views. Besides the confusion
at times during the investigation on course, in the end it's all too simplistic and doesn't end in a glorious tone. Silent and slow, ""Bullitt"" is the total opposite of
the other film Bill Hickman appeared in as well which is ""The French Connection"", to me the film that defined the action genre as we know it. That movie had the rhythm,
the perfect chase sequence, an elaborated plot and it was taken from an actual case. I know it's apples and oranges but it's a way better film than this one which left
my head scratching in disbelief and in pain. It starts off well but through the majority of it I felt bored and tired of seeing how things would unfold.Favorite sequences includes the shootout at the hotel then the whole hospital sequence with the wounded guys treated by the doctors - very realistic - and Bullitt
following the killer on its corridors. As for the famous car chase sequence on the streets of San Francisco, a location rarely used on movies back then, I find it one of
the most disengaging and overrated sequences of all time. There's not even a music score to give suspense to some of its brilliant shots with some nice stunts provided by
McQueen himself.On a final analysis I don't see much relevance for the movie even though I know it's an important classic that has its good share of fans and was imitated several times
over the years. Not sure if I'll look forward to another view so soon but it's possible in some years later. Don't recommend. 4/10.",Bullitt

There was really nothing new, as Cop Critics in the News Media were already plying their trade in the press for the better part of the previous decade.The world was in a real state of flux in that year of '68. And we would have change, whether we wanted it or not! When you have so many forces aligning their energies against you, just try to roll with the punches and ride out the storm.First of all, we have had our Police critics forever, and we always will. Their voice amplification comes to the public via the prostituted Liberal* Press and the hypocritical vultures that(not 'who') reside there.But beyond these reasons, we had several other political and socio-economic movements were converging on Americans at that same time. We had the Civil Rights movement, the Femmenists/Equal Rights Amendment lobby(anchored by NOW-the National Organization of Women), then there was the Vietnam War and the Anti-War Crowd, Homosexual Rights reigned as Gays and Lesbians joined forces. And if these causes weren't enough, we had what has been called the Sexual Revolution already raging for some time.Now, what do all these items have to do with Police and Police Departments?, I hear you ask. Well, EVERYTHING, that's what! Remember, when there is any confrontations, any protest marchers, any Labor Strife, Parades for any Causes, and just about anything else, it automatically becomes the problem of the Police! So, naturally there will be complaints, for when you have 2 parties involved, or 2 sides to a dispute, at least 1 of the parties is dissatisfied with the adjudication of the situation.So, it was to this strife filled 1968 that Mr. Steve McQueen came to bring life to this character from the novel MUTE WITNESS by Robert L. Fish. He agreed that if her were to portray a Cop, he'd have to be ""the coolest Cop around!"" He was.The story revolves around Organized Crime in the U.S.A., Senate Hearings, Nosey and Over Anxious News Media,Show Boating Politicians,and the Unseen and Unchecked Political Pressure that is put on the Police, from all sides.An important witness, being held in a secret location, winds up ""sleeping with Loca Brasi & the Fishes"", then the chase is on to both catch the Hit Man and to salvage the precious Senate Hearings.In addition to the fine, underplayed usual McQueen performance, we are treated to great cast support. Robert Vaughn(Lead Atty Walter Chalmers), Jacqueline Bisset(who cares?!?!?Woo-Woo-Woo-Woo!),Don Gordon (Detective Delgheti), Robert Duvall(Cabbie Weissberg),Simon Oakland(Capt. Sam Bennett), Norman Fell(Capt. Baker),Georg Stanford Brown(Dr.Willard), Vick Tayback(Pete Ross),Ed Peck(Ed Peck) and the rest, too numerous to mention.When one thinks of BULLITT, the thought of ""car chase"" immediately. And it is with good reason as the film boasted of the greatest screen car chase, ever-up to that point. It paved the way for the others to come, especially Popeye Doyle(Gene Hackman)'s maniacal, single minded pursuit of the overhead ""El"" Train in THE FRENCH CONNECTION(1971).Curious also, because it was the same Stunt Driver(Bill Hickman)who plays the Hit-man in BULLITT and Federal Man Bill Mulderig in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, who did all the fine driving stunts in both films.NOTE: * The term ""Liberal"" actually seems quite inappropriate to these denizens of the Left Wing. After all, a truly ""liberally minded"" Person would have an open mind to others thoughts and words, even if it meant disagreement. These ""Liberals"" are truly the ""Fascists"" that they always call Conservatives.",Bullitt
61,johnnyboyz,"Patchy and generally uninteresting on the whole, Bullitt's reputation does not quite do itself justice.",6,17 July 2008,"I guess I just didn't take to Bullitt in the way I was supposed to, in fact I found it to be quite a routine and patchy film that carries a reputation of vast, vast greatness that can only be attributed to the fact a; there is an awesome car chase in it and b; it has Steve McQueen starring. Part of the drawback in watching some of these films now from yester-decade is the hype that is passed down through means of reading, watching and hearing about them. An individual scene, an individual actor, performance or even a plot twist  it is the nagging feeling you get at the back of your mind that you know nothing about the film you're watching apart from the very reason you're perhaps seeing it in the first place. I've had this problem in the past and suffered it with films like The French Connection and Psycho but other times I've know about certain things that give the film its legendary status and it hasn't hindered the viewing: Casablanca being a very good example.So why is it that Bullitt comes across as so ordinary if not solely for the fact its reputation to do with an individual actor and scene precedes it? Simple reason is, its one of those cause and effect chase films that relies on American officers of the law barking and asking questions when required to whoever it is required they ask them to. I don't like films such as the latter two in the Bourne series; I didn't like The French Connection that much and Bullitt similarly joins the very same cannon of 'sort of interesting at times but nothing too great'.Like most films that fall into this genre of espionage or chase, the film begins with a shooting that is both ambiguous in its motivations and in terms of who actually did it. Sometimes films can press on and deliver entertaining and interesting romps based on this initial scene idea, Three Days of the Condor and The Bourne Identity standing out. But both films were made after Bullitt and it would be silly to compare them all to one another. Going into a film which has stood the test of time or has had someone hear of it down the years because of a mere chase scene, it is not difficult to notice that the best parts of this film are its chase scenes. But to my surprise, the famous car chase is not the best part of Bullitt, that being the chase on foot through the hospital. The chase has a structure to it, something the later chase scenes will mirror.The scene uses its enclosed but large scale location of the hospital to really good effect when a survivor of a motel room ambush is again caught up in an assassination attempt when someone comes to the hospital he's being treated at to finish him off. The chase is on foot and takes place down a series of dark and gloomy corridors. But the pacing and editing of this chase is remarkable in the sense we never perceive McQueen's character of Bullitt as someone with superhuman strength. He is a human chasing another human and anything that gets in his way may cause a threat to him, such as objects or the fact he may get lost  maybe even the fact he does not know if his target is hiding around the next corner with a gun. This is a far cry to films nowadays; anyone remember Vin Diesel's character in the opening scene of A Man Apart, when he chases down a taxi cab harbouring the 'bad guy'? But then again the chase on foot in Bullitt is good because of its pacing of running, hiding and searching and also because it does pause to give the audience a breath of fresh air; perhaps even making them 'jump' with stuff hitting the ground after falling through a laundry chute. This technique and using the third element as a means of interaction for both chasing parties works well and is utilised later on when massive airliners block the way for an airport/runway chase scene towards the climax. There is also the breaking of the chase for pistol shots to be fired. But I think the film as a whole is a very, very minute failure. The initial incident that propels the film may be uninventive but they make good use of it for a while. Bullitt is puzzled, worried and maybe scared at what has happened and there is an air of interest when everybody plays 'detective' in searching and asking questions.But the film makes its golden error, perhaps ironically, right after the chase scene everyone remembers it for. There is a revelation and the people who spawned the initial incident are involved in an important part of the film. After this, the film feels as if it no longer has a bad guy  there's just no conflict bar some ego fuelled scenes with Chalmers (Vaughn), a man whose role I cannot entirely remember the importance of. There cannot be too many surprises in the fact the film looses its suspense and intrigue once certain events transpire at the end of the car chase around San Francisco because we no longer have too much of a reason to feel unnerved. All the build up and aftermath of the initial shooting is quite intense and we feel for Bullitt, especially when he's in the ambulance with the injured man. But if we do feel short-changed, then that is a shame with any film. When we feel a little short-changed with an early contemporary piece of great reputation, then that could be deemed as quite sad.",Bullitt

Ultimately, Bullitt is not about the car chase and shoot-outs, but about a person trying to maintain his humanity and self-respect while doing a violent, sordid job. Frank Bullitt was a particularly interesting character for McQueen because he was, for the first time, playing a respected police detective. This is a stylish flick that created a basis for all future police procedurals to follow. Its directed by Peter Yates (Robbery, Breaking Away). Actually the car chase at the beginning in the film ROBBERY, has been very influential. It was seen by Steve McQueen, and led him to approve Yates as the director of Bullitt (1968). Bullit stars Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn and Jacqueline Bisset n Robert Duvall in a minor role. Cinematography by William A. Fraker (Tombstone - one of my fave western). Editing by Frank P. Keller (won an Oscar for this flick). McQueen made the fast-draw shoulder holster look slick. Several items of clothing worn by Steve McQueen received a boost in popularity, desert boots, a trench coat, a blue turtleneck sweater and, most famously, a brown jacket with elbow patches.

64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Well made, missing some excitement, especially for the '60s",6,16 April 2012,"For a movie called ""Bullitt,"" this Steve McQueen vehicle is awfully slower than you'd expect. Peter Yates has crafted something that feels more like an espionage thriller than the story of a cop playing by his own rules. I tend most often to rue having expectations when they deal with pacing; when you're in the mood for something to be fast or you want it to be fast, it can be a drain. Same thing for vice-versa, though not nearly as much. ""Bullitt"" grinds, and any grinder needs to be tense, which ""Bullitt"" manages inconsistently.At the same time, Yates gives us plenty to champion, as does McQueen. The on-location shooting, a trend that grew in the '60s, makes the imagery memorable for certain. The film takes place exclusively in San Francisco (outside of an opening credit scene in Chicago (though filmed in San Francisco)) and it makes a world of difference. The best scene is a car chase through the city's famously steep streets, which you have to believe was a blast for McQueen to film.McQueen stars as Lt. Frank Bullitt, a man highly regarded for his work, and as such he's tasked by a wealthy politician named Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) to safeguard a man named Ross. Ross will be testifying against the mob, and as such he's a hot target. When the protection gets compromised and things go awry, Bullitt must clean up the mess, but not at the discretion of Chalmers or his superiors. As another great Frank said, he'll do it his way.All the action sequences in ""Bullitt"" are chases. Chases in the hospital, chases in cars, chases in an airport. Some striking violence pops up throughout, which proves effective enough given the scarcity and the lack of hesitancy toward showing blood. I can't recall a film older than this that had more graphic violence.The absence of effective scoring is the most glaring weakness of Yates' decision-making. Despite having Lalo Schifrin at his disposal, the man whose eight-note riff for ""Mission: Impossible"" will live in infamy, the biggest scenes play to background noise, such as the roar of a car engine for nearly 10 minutes. It subdues the tone and suggests the desire to be taken more seriously. It's counter to everything that went on in the '60s, but it shows a great deal of artistic integrity.McQueen certainly feels that way based on his performance. Bullitt is a colorless fellow, which would make fellow San Franciscan Dirty Harry Callahan, who would emerge just three years later, the Fourth of July. Although cast in a similar mold, these two couldn't be further apart. McQueen opts for a certain grit, leaving any sense of showmanship behind. Like the rest of the film, you have to respect the choice.""Bullitt"" feels like a film out of its time. Its lone Oscar win for Best Film Editing demonstrates a recognition of the technical prowess on display, but considering this was the James Bond decade — the era of fast cars, fast women and fast jazz flute solos — the excitement and entertainment factor is missing. In a post-""French Connection"" (1971) world, it would probably fair better, but the expectation for a little excitement, some expert pacing, holds it back.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Not even his Captain would give him too much of a hard time. Mostly police captains were big-time jerks, not in this movie.

Bullitt put his trust in Dr. Willard(Georg Stanford Brown) went the witness was shot. But when cardiac arrest claimed the victim, Bullitt hid the body, so that shady politician Walt Chalmers(Robert Vaughn) wouldn't know. Robert Vaughn is known to play seedy characters in ever show. Sometimes helpful, sometimes not. In ""Bullitt"" he was completely full of himself. The mack-daddy of all scenes is the chase! Ford Mustang vs. Dodge Charger. 12 minutes of speed is what the movie needs. Thought the Mustang took a few buck shots through the windshield it still came out on top, except on the spin out when the right front axle gave out. Other than that, this movie was the bomb!

I can imagine that this movie was fresh and intense at that time, in the 1960ies, but reviewing it now is rather complicated as there are thousands of later similar movies, with similar or better actors (e.g., Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman - already in the 1970ies). Moreover, contemporary restless viewers are used to faster changes of scenes, and many would use fast forward function if possible... The famous car chase is yet impressive (including the models involved), but many other scenes would currently look ridiculous, due to enhanced number of cars and stringent security in airports, above all. The ending could have been more sophisticated as well.As for the cast, it is evenly strong, but all characters are somewhat insipid or stiff - in spite of background or occupation; even Jacqueline Bisset as Cathy lacks sensuality.

69,jadavix,Thrilling chase scenes redeem a confusing plot,7,23 February 2016,"""Bullitt"" is three thrilling chase sequences with a lot of confusing meandering in between. You know who the good guy is, and at least a few of the bad guys. You don't know exactly who they are or what they're doing or why they're doing it. This leads to prolonged scenes of confusing running around without much dramatic pay off.The character of Bullitt doesn't help much. He is distant and unreadable. Although this could certainly be scene as a precursor to the endless action fare of the '80s, Steve McQueen's character here is very different to the Stallones and Van Dammes of that later decade. Those were passionate men. They may have lived for the job, but at least they gave it their all. Bullitt is so withdrawn he walks away from encounters with cop killers rather than flying off the handle like Kurt Russell would. He also says very little. There is the scene that would become a staple of all action movies starring cops: the hero being scolded by his superior. Bullitt hasn't really done enough to earn a thorough tongue lashing, though, and he doesn't get one. He isn't even asked to hand in his badge and gun.The chases, though, are worth the price of admission. There is, of course, the car chase toward the end of the movie, which remains impressive. The other two happen on foot, first in a hospital following a blocky man with grey hair, and at the end, on and off a plane. At one point Bullitt almost gets run over on the runway. The chase features a reversal of roles at the end, with the bad guy waiting for Bullitt with his gun drawn. These bits are heart pounding, but the bits in between are just too longwinded and meandering. Peter Yates, a name I was unfamiliar with, has an unobtrusive directing style, and with McQueen's monkish, emotionless performance, this doesn't work. We needed something - anything - to come between us and Steve McQueen's Bullitt, who becomes exasperating in his emotionless.Directors, of course, solved this problem in later movies by always featuring a wise cracking partner, or even criminal enlisted to help the cop (see 48 Hrs.). This cliché has become truly tired, and I wasn't hoping for something like that while watching Bullitt. I just needed either a little more McQueen, or a lot more Yates.",Bullitt
70,freemantle_uk,A proper gritty police thriller with a great car chase,8,2 October 2010,"The late 60s and early 70s was a great period for cinema. It was a period where films were becoming more gritty and more violence, like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and more crime and police films became a major force in the box-office.

He hides the death from his superior and sets out to find the hit men and the wider crime involving 'the Organisation'. All this is going on as he lives a life of loneliness and attempts a relationship British woman, Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset).Under the expert direction of Peter Yates Bullitt is a tense, exciting little action thriller.

Yates attempts to make the film more gritty, showing that getting shot is messy and that many of the crimes take place in less glamour areas. The crimes were kept simple and despite the film being set in San Francisco it was not a travelogue for that city (which is a strength). The car chase scene is incredible, a full-throttle experience of two car going through San Francisco and the outskirts. The scene was so well shot and edited, with cars being place in the cars, with one bit almost being point-of-view from Bullitt and an effective use of zooming and panning the camera. It was refreshing to see that an older film just places the camera in the right place and just allows the action to happen, rather then have a lot of shaky cam shots and quick cuts: this is how to film a car chase people! Yates was also able to inject a little style when he filmed the opened credit sequence, using the letters of people to show a different location of the action. Sometimes the pacing was a little a too slow, but Yates was trying to show a bit of character development. It was also very interesting to see the cops in action, whether it was looking a murder still or looking a evidence in the lab.Acting wise the film was decent. McQueen was always a strong lead in whatever he did, whether it was the Great Escape to The Magnificent Seven. He was very convincing as an action hero and as a resource cop who plays by his own rules. Many of the supporting police give the usual performance required for that role in the 60s and 70s, speak in a gruff and rough voice. Norman Fell was an example of this as the police captain who protects Bullitt. Vaughn as fine as a unlikeable politician and Paul Genge and Pat Renella were strong with roles that required little speaking. It actually added to the power of the film and their performances.The plot itself was perfectly, mixing the right amount of realism and fantasy. But it was focused or developed too much because it was really an excuse for Bullitt to work alone and catch the bad guys.An enjoyable film.",Bullitt
71,Polaris_DiB,Great fun in the era,8,1 May 2006,"In a movie pretty typical of its time period, Steve McQueen plays a rough, morally ambiguous cop who does what it takes to bring his own flavor of justice to the world.Whereas today this is a pretty standard hero/antihero to follow, this movie is much more questioning of the authorities it presents than just pandering to a sense of fun. Bullitt is trapped (or does he place himself willingly?) into a world full of pain and death... and the stoic, hard-faced acting of Steve McQueen is like Clint Eastwood without all the fury, though beware the anger that may flow underneath.This movie has to have been very inspiring to modern day filmmakers. Steve McQueen doing his own fast-paced driving through San Francisco is echoed later in The Rock with Nicholas Cage's doing his own fast-paced driving through roughly the same terrain. The ending chase through the airport is mimicked with almost the exact same imagery years later in Heat. And while I consider both of those other movies to be pretty good, to some degree they have nothing to this movie's willingness to take it long, tense takes that alert to us, oh yes, he's not just a character doing this... these stunts are for real. Many have called the car chase scene one of the best ever recorded on film. I have to agree.--PolarisDiB",Bullitt

73,dee.reid,"Faster than a speeding ""Bullitt,"" and it's still better than the rest",10,14 June 2005,"Steve McQueen - action movie hero - the icon of cool. Before Tom Cruise became the coolest actor to ever fly an F-14 during the '80s for his role in ""Top Gun"" (1986), there was McQueen, in his '67 Ford Mustang blazing up the San Francisco freeway in ""Bullitt.""When McQueen died in 1980 of lung cancer, it signaled the end of an era of coolness, but not before he'd left a legacy for others who dreamed of achieving some degree of stardom. He was certainly one of the most beloved actors of his time, and of course many subsequent performers have lived by his cool style. And one of McQueen's most famous roles was that of Frank Bullitt in this thriller from 1968.By today's standards, ""Bullitt"" will register as nothing more than a by-the-numbers police thriller, with a few scattered action sequences spread throughout its plot. But in 1968, director Peter Yates brought forth a movie that was entirely new (though based off the novel ""Mute Witness"" by Robert L. Pike), and in quoting critic Leonard Maltin, ""{A} Now-classic car chase, one of the screen's all-time best.""Yes, ""Bullitt"" also makes for a hell of an action movie, with one of the most intense and exciting car chases in cinematic history. Again, by today's standards this wouldn't amount to much, but it's classic simply because of the pace, editing, Yates' direction, the fact that audiences had seen nothing like it in '68, and let's not kid ourselves here: it's a chase between McQueen's Ford Mustang and two henchmen driving a Dodge Charger (which is MY personal favorite muscle car).But ""Bullitt"" does have a plot, and it concerns McQueen as the intrepid, no-nonsense San Francisco cop of the film's title, who's given a routine assignment of safeguarding a witness who's been set to testify against a notorious criminal syndicate known only as ""The Organization."" When the witness, along with Bullitt's partner, are gunned down by unknown assailants, he goes to work to track down those responsible and this culminates not only in the aforementioned car chase sequence, but also a pretty bloody shoot-out and foot-chase in an airport.While all of this going on, Bullitt must also balance his commitment to his live-in girlfriend Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) and must also tangle with a mysterious government agent named Chalmers (Robert Vaughn), whom Bullitt is very suspicious of. And this is about all there is to the plot, and about all that you need to know about the plot.Steve McQueen demonstrated in ""Bullitt"" why he is one of the most loved actors of all time. Of course this is only speculation too, but maybe he also influenced entire generations of on-screen cops who bend the rules, defy their superiors, and have a go-at-it-alone attitude. But McQueen did it as one of the first and best.As a movie, though, the success of ""Bullitt"" may baffle some viewers today, being that this movie is best remembered for a car chase and not much else, since there aren't many action scenes. But I begin with reassurances that ""Bullitt"" is far better than most of the mindless action spectacles that we're used to seeing in 2005. Do you think that ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) is best remembered for its violence or that ""Enter the Dragon"" (1973) is remembered for being Bruce Lee's first and only American movie?Maybe so, but this may demonstrate the limited scope of today's film-going public, who may not be able to recognize true greatness when it's staring right at them. ""Bullitt"" is one such great, classic police thriller that's stood the test of time, and should be remembered as one of Steve McQueen's greatest movies.10/10",Bullitt
74,drqshadow-reviews,Style Over Substance in this Influential Cop Thriller,6,12 September 2019,"A super, super stylish slab of police detective action, starring Steve McQueen, right at the height of his status as the coolest man in all of Hollywood. It certainly looks great. Bullitt's picture quality and directorial choices are astounding for a fifty-year-old film, with a heavy, lasting influence on modern action cornerstones. An ambitious opening credits sequence sets that tone early, creative and experimental and ahead of its time, while McQueen's essential wardrobe choices remain fashionable throughout.Perhaps the film's most memorable, and oft-referenced, legacy is its climactic, screeching, white-knuckled muscle car chase through the streets of San Francisco. That scene alone is almost worth the price of admission, a ten-minute thrill ride with tangible mass, unpolished mistakes, curved steel and grim consequences. It almost, almost, polishes over the extra-slow pace, occasional stereotypes and confusing plot turns.Still an entertaining watch, but often as nothing more than a simple, vivid document of everyday life in SF during the late 60s. There's barely enough substance in the police story to fill a twenty-minute network TV crime drama.",Bullitt

I think Steve McQueen's iconic portrayal of Bullitt has influenced every cop movie made since in some way. The cinematography in this film is excellent.The score to this film is incredible, honestly one of the best I've ever heard. Bullitt's score employs a variety of jazz instruments and melodies to contribute to the mood of the film, which bounces back and forth between mysterious, tense, and explosive.

78,jimbo-53-186511,"Well-made, but the narrative is heavily flawed",5,20 October 2014,"*************MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOWS************ It's rare that I skim through other people's reviews before submitting my own review and I also decided to check out the message boards to see if anyone had noticed the same problems with this film as I'd observed after watching it, but couldn't find the answers. For me, Bullitt was a well-made film, but there were also major aspects of the narrative that just didn't make sense....The biggest problem for me was the big plot twist involving what actually happened to Ross. My understanding is that Ross paid Rennick to pretend to be him for a couple of days in exchange for a large sum of money, but then Ross double crossed Rennick and had him killed by the hit-men (who believed that they had killed the real Ross). Ross then intended to flee the country under the assumed identity of Albert Rennick. OK; I have some questions..... 1) How did Rennick and Ross meet or discuss this plan? 2) Why would Rennick trust someone who was on the run from the mob for defrauding them? I mean, if he's prepared to betray his own people then he's not going to think twice about betraying a stranger. 3) The two hit-men that presumed that they killed Ross end up dead, yet no-one within the organisation bothers to come looking for them. These two hit-men must have been reporting to someone so why did no-one from the organisation follow their lead after they were killed? Aside from narrative problems, there are other problems with this film such as the fact that it is quite poor in terms of character development; Jacqueline Bisset who plays Cathy (Bullitt's girlfriend) was particularly badly written and seemed to serve very little purpose in this film other than to provide a bit of 'eye candy'. McQueen's Bullitt is a character who's mean and moody and is also a character without much development. McQueen's acting is fairly wooden here, but I must admit that he does have a cool aura about him which almost makes his wooden acting forgivable. Again, Robert Vaughan's character is quite poorly developed and he just seems to be the clichéd government official whose only interest is looking good in front of his peers and isn't really bothered about anybody else. On a positive note, Vaughan does put in an excellent performance and is very convincing in his respective role, but no-one else was in the same league as Vaughan.I've panned Bullitt quite a lot, but one thing I have to concede is that it is fantastic from a technical perspective; the direction, the editing, the photography are all absolutely superb. Finally, we come to that 'car chase' - yes it is as good as everyone says it is. Unlike most car chases, there are occasions when you almost get a first person perspective so that it feels as though you're actually driving the car yourself. I must admit that the car chase was superb.Ultimately, Bullitt is a film that is good and bad in equal measure; the technical team (directing, editing, and photography) should give themselves a pat on the back. However, those responsible for the screenplay and narrative should have made sure that the story was more cohesive and less vague. There are good and bad in equal measures which is why I've given Bullitt a 5/10.",Bullitt

80,yusufpiskin,An epic Steve McQueen film.,7,23 March 2020,"It starts very slow. Almost leisurely. Replicating the pace of the movie in general. But more on that in a minute.The driver of the Charger spots Bullitt's Mustang. Decides to take the upper hand. Follows the detective at a distance. It carries on like that for a moment, but only for a moment. Bullitt turns, drives up a road, the Charger follows.At the top of the hill the Mustang isn't in sight. The man in the thick-framed glasses looks both ways. Guesses left. In a moment the Mustang appears. In his rear view mirror. He's the one being followed now.Still the pace doesn't increase, not quite yet. This is all still prologue.Then it's a bit faster. Like with a pace car at the Indy, the speed is starting to be set. But then Thick-Framed Glasses stops and buckles up. For safety. It's at that point that they are off. A quick and sudden turn, a taxi in the way and the Charger is almost lost. Almost.But the Mustang regains. Swerves, dodges traffic, keeps up. And for the next seven minutes Bullitt is the fastest movie on the planet. The irony is that The Chase (because it deserves the capitals) is in one of the slowest procedurals around. Bullitt is all about pace, either fast or slow, and how that pace builds tension.Steve McQueen can move fast or slow. His intensity is constant, regardless of speed. He's perfect for the role. For The Chase. But most importantly for the film. Because honestly Bullitt is far more than The Chase.Think of the scene where a group of cops stand around a Telecopier (because that deserves a capital too). They wait desperately for a page to print. The sound of the printer going back and forth, back and forth. And nothing else. It's a brilliant scene where no one is doing anything. Then there's the ending. Tension builds as a line of passengers board a plane, slowly, and then the plane pulls away, slowly, only to have to go back, slowly, and unload, even more slowly. None of this is cut short.And through it all, you are on the edge of your seat.",Bullitt
81,drystyx,Car chase scenes will never replace horse chases,2,8 May 2006,"Bullitt had its moments. Basically, Steve McQueen is a detective chasing bad guys and getting heat from his superiors. Maybe clichéd now, but at the time it was made not so clichéd. The violence isn't the reason children shouldn't see this film. Actually, there's one scene which by my eye the entire movie was made to show, and that was the propaganda (each movie uses propaganda, or no one would bother making the movie, so I don't mean this in a bad way always, but here it definitely is), of the two mean involved in the car chase scene against McQueen. McQueen is the free spirit who doesn't use the seat belt, but the camera clearly shows these two guys buckling up. In the end, McQueen drives away unscathed, and the other two guys literally lose their heads. There is no doubt that this is the central point of the picture, to tell people not to use seat belts, and a very heavy handed demonstration. Statistics show otherwise, and that's why the movie should be harder for kids to see than porn. The rest of the movie, I feel safe to say, is to try to make the audience accept the car chase scene as a replacement for the western horse chase scene, and its proponents are still trying to pound this theory into the American psyche. However, cars are boring machines, and horses are living, breathing entities. Think back when you were a kid-would you really even consider looking at a car instead of a horse? Americans have to brainwashed to accept this. And some are. They are called rednecks. Maybe if you spend your life around horses and rarely see an automobile, you could get excited about the car chase, but otherwise this is a study in boredom. The conflicts are well portrayed, but only 2 stars. Would get 3 if not for the seat belt bit.",Bullitt
82,slokes,I Left My Hubcaps In San Francisco,8,13 August 2005,"The first lone-wolf cop story plays by the rules of the genre it spawned, featuring a charismatic, outsider type who carries a badge and an attitude directed just as much against the egos and hubris of his superiors as against the criminal element.Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) is a detective lieutenant on the San Francisco police force who gets handed a ""babysitting job"" looking after a would-be Mob informant by ambitious politico Chalmers (Robert Vaughn). Things go wrong with an attempted hit that leaves the informant and his guard in intensive care and Bullitt on the wrong side of Chalmers, not to mention a pair of killer hoods who tool around in a Dodge Charger and have no respect either for stop signs or Mustangs.""Bullitt"" the movie is best-known for an automotive duel between the assassin duo and Bullitt, still championed by some as the greatest car chase in movie history. I think it's been lapped myself, though I admire the long sections of real-time churn-and-burn since it flies in the face of MTV-style fast cutting we know today. The hoods Bullitt chase look like insurance salesmen, but of course they were really stunt men, and with McQueen doing a good deal of his own stunt driving as well, there's a validity to the sequence that makes up for some slackness in the composition.""Bullitt"" is a better film for the things that occur around the car chase, not so much with the central mystery of Johnny Ross as with the scenes of Bullitt in his element, like making coffee, talking with his superiors, eating a sandwich. McQueen's acting was showcased better in films like ""The Sand Pebbles,"" ""The Cincinnati Kid,"" and even his final film ""The Hunter,"" but his star power was never more in evidence than it was here, especially in the scenes he shares with Vaughn, who plays the role of a preppy hardass to perfection and gives both McQueen and the viewer a foil more evil than the real crooks in this picture.Seeing Bullitt handle Chalmers' baiting is a real lesson in how less is more. There's a scene where a fingerprint check gives Bullitt the opportunity to let Chalmers have it, but instead of rounding on the jerk, he simply tells Chalmers the score as he makes for the door in one of the great underplayed lines ever filmed.Verisimilitude is everything in ""Bullitt,"" as director Peter Yates and screenwriters Alan Trustman and Harry Kleiner present it. Long scenes are shot in operating rooms, morgues, and hotel-room crime scenes as a way of presenting what we are seeing as real in a way no other film did then and few have done since. Every shot, as Yates explains on his DVD commentary, was shot on a real location, and you feel like he got it all down exactly right, getting the right mix of style and drab reality. A shot cop moans while blood pulses through his wound, while a strangled woman is seen in such gory detail we understand another character's need to throw up over it. Throughout there's Bullitt as only McQueen could play him, saying the right line the right way, jumping in an ambulance to fix a problem, telling his gorgeous girlfriend (Jacqueline Bisset) ""It's not for you, baby"" in a way that comes off utterly cool rather than gratingly sexist.I couldn't figure out what was going on with the crooks  ""the Organization"" as they are dubbed since calling them the Mafia was seen as demeaning to a particular ethnic group not yet known for creating films like ""The Godfather"" or ""GoodFellas""  not until I watched ""Bullitt"" a second time, at which point I realized that wasn't so important. ""Bullitt"" has an annoying subtext of police work as dehumanizing, something Bullitt understands implicitly makes him a tool for the wrong sort of people. That was the year that was 1968, Chicago and all that, but the au currant anti-establishment notes do rankle.But McQueen was a cinematic great, one who doesn't get as much attention today but proves here why his image is so enduring. Yates credits the clothes McQueen wears, but Yates himself, along with his writers, Vaughn, Bissett, and a terrific supporting cast led by Simon Oakland as Bullitt's tough-but-fair captain, create one of the great platforms for a movie tough guy ever built, a platform McQueen fills very, very well.",Bullitt

Unable to trust anyone, he must risk his job and his life to uncover who is behind the murder.Bullitt is a terrific cop movie and one of the most influential, which a lot of people find boring for precisely the reason it's so good - its commitment to realism. It's a laudable attempt to take a stylised action thriller and present the characters as realistically as possible. This is done through using real locations, subtle understated acting and rigorous adherence to investigative procedure. At the same time, the direction is extremely stylish; mean old Frisco is captured perfectly and Yates adds lots of lovely little unnecessary but intriguing character touches into the film (the nodding-dog in the back of Duvall's taxi-cab, McQueen picking up handfuls of TV dinners in the grocery-store, Bissett's statistical tables of pipe volume-to-pressure ratios). As a consequence, the film is somehow very real and immediate and yet also supercool and fun. It's also very famous for the brilliant car chase halfway through between McQueen in a green Shelby Cobra and stuntman Hickman in a black Dodge Charger, which is absolutely sensational; not only is it brilliantly shot (it starts as a slow-burn stalking and turns into a screaming high-octane affair), starting in the city and then moving out to the Californian coast, but McQueen did all his own driving too.

But like there's much more than action in ROBBERY, the cop/crime classic BULLITT is more about words than wheels...In particular, McQueen's Frank Bullitt taking a blind chance to prove climbing politician Robert Vaughn wrong, and without even realizing what's not exactly right in the first place...Hiding a dead former witness that Frank and partner Don Gordon were hired to protect, the best scene has McQueen and Vaughn facing off in a polite (hospital) conversation leading to several slightly less polite confrontations (with chief Simon Oakland as a wishbone)...And how all this pans out occurs before and after that hilly San Francisco chase in what truly epitomizes Police Procedural cinema -- by putting the viewer into the deliberately slow-paced, concentrated, methodical shoes of Lt. Bullitt and, after proving what needs proving there's only one big action scene left...Giving BULLITT two climaxes for the price of one edgy, daring and timeless (though dated) masterpiece that needs remembering for more than a revving green Mustang.

Bullet , on the other hand , is not one of his better films although it still is classed as iconic. If there is ever a film that typifies the late 1960's it is this. It looks superb yet it is backed up with one of the most irritating backing soundtracks i can remember. (I like the title track). There is very little dialogue and what there is , is very stilted. Robert Vaughn is great and a young Jacqueline Bisset looks stunning. The most memorable thing about Bullet is THAT chase scene. McQueen , who did his own stunts , really struggles with that 1968 Ford Mustang GTE around the streets of San Fransisco and it's mesmerising to watch.

It's spare, tight, lacking ostentatious music or camera work, reserved in its dialogue and exposition.
This is highly confident film-making. The actors convey with their eyes, not wild gestures, catch-phrases, shakey-cams, fist-fights, gratuitous violence (for the most part) or swearing. Of course there's Steve McQueen, but check out Bill Hickman's eyes during the car chase.
The stunts are credible. The CGI doesn't exist. And the car chase, so manly.
The only shortcoming for me is Jacqueline Bissett. Her character is pointless. I don't care what kind of psycho-mumbo-jumbo her role is supposed to convey on the proceedings. Bullitt isn't going to sit around talking about his feelings, no way, no how.

Instead we will all be riding in hybrids and the cars our ancestors have driven for centuries will be looked upon as an ancient relic. Movies like ""Bullitt"" will be viewed as film of wonderment like steam was for people who admired Jules Verne.

While in a comatose disposition, Ross survives and when words caught on he lived through the ordeal, Bullitt uses Ross as a decoy to capture the mobsters hiding quarters. However, Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) a councilperson takes Ross' testimony as an opportunity to step ladder his way further into the political system, as he'll do anything possible to ruin Bullitt's reputation. From there, Bullitt is now in the precarious situation as he's interrogated by his superiors and is forced to answer the heavy questions about this whole investigation. Bullitt has the hefty workload as he's chasing the bad guys while fending off against the system. With the exception being McQueen's Bullitt, most of the characters don't stand out very well. Jacqueline Bisset as his girlfriend seems just padded on at the last minute and the caper story behind the thick of things is told very vaguely and very complex in detail. But film fans will not remember ""Bullitt"" for its story or its characters. And for the record, the story with the exception of some scenes, for the most part is not entirely engaging. But ""Bullitt"" has two reasons why this film stands out among viewers. The first being that McQueen defines the anti-hero in his performance and the second being the greatest car chase in cinematic history. Although it's not the greatest film he's starred in (""The Great Escape"" takes that honour), ""Bullitt"" is the film that crowned McQueen as the King of Cool. From his bright blue eyes and his and his intense persona, this the guy that every man dreams he wants to be. When he was in his prime, he was untouchable and in ""Bullitt"", his charisma speaks louder than him. Granted this film has very little in terms of dialogue, but McQueen's expressions are flawless and succeeds in keeping it real. Plenty of actors tried to emulate the coolness that McQueen had to offer, but in the end, McQueen is still the King. The eternally famous nine minute heart-pulsing car chase scene has been inspired by other film that followed thereafter. The rapidly moving speed will make your heart palpitate as it goes through non-stop without any of the jarring quick cuts or shaky cams that today's action flicks seem to do which make them very annoying. Sadly, the chase scene is where the film's excitement stops. The rest of the film doesn't have the essential story structuring to carry through. Which is shame, because the foot-chase that ends the movie plus the high-impacted airport sequence still lacks may sound like something climactic, but in the end it comes up formulaic.Oil may be running its course, and GM is at an upgrade, the days of halcyon inclined cars will become a thing of the past but Bullitt's Ford Mustang will truly be a dinosaur in our industry. If ever the curious minded youngster in our future wants to gasp at how our muscle-cars work, than Bullitt's chase scene will likely quench your thirsty minds. It surely isn't the best thriller out there, but it is a landmark of the the 1960's due to its cool cars and McQueen's persona.",Bullitt
91,JuguAbraham,More than a car chase and action film,7,10 August 2001,"I have read the comments of most IMDB users on this movie. None of them have written on what struck me as unusual for a Hollywood film of the Sixties. And that's the soundtrack. There is a lot of emphasis in this film on natural sound than on music--sounds of cars on the roads that even permeate into rooms, without any encroachment of music. When Bullitt enters the hotel room in which a killing has taken place--all you hear is sound from outside the room. This is the treatment European directors would have adopted or by later Hollywood filmmakers such as Terrence Mallick or John Sayles or John Cassavettes. Of course, director John Boorman did something similar in ""Point Blank"" with Lee Marvin walking heavily down corridors but the sound was too pronounced compared to ""Bullitt"" where the sounds were natural.
I do not mean here that Lalo Schifrin's music is not used without effect. It is. The restaurant scene is exquisite in this respect.I was equally impressed by the Oscar winning editing and the remarkable photography of William Fraker (especially the sequence with Bisset and McQueen off the highway among the reeds).Finally, was this McQueen's best film? I preferred him in ""The Reivers"", the little known film of this arresting actor.On the direction, I was impressed by the development of the character of Bullitt, shown through the three or four early morning scenes of his bedroom--the first one when he is alone, the second and third when he is with Bisset and finally when he finds Bisset sleeping in his bed. The direction is in tune with the main character--evocative without dwelling too long on details.It is interesting that Mann's ""Heat"" used similar airport outdoor sequences some 30 years later.",Bullitt
92,screenman,Decent Vintage Thriller,7,24 May 2009,"Largely remembered for the car chase and Steve McQueen's ice-cool persona, 'Bullitt' is actually a pretty formulaic thriller. McQueen was an archetypal tough guy of his time. He and Paul Newman were like a pair of book-ends, something made manifest in 'The Towering Inferno'. Oozing charisma, his presence could turn even a comparatively mediocre movie into something special. And let's face it; without him, 'Bullitt' would have been a mediocre movie. There's a slick, stylish intro, in which the credits slide from the screen leaving a sort of 'ghost' credit behind. There's an excellent - if again, rather formulaic - jazz riff going full tilt. The action, when it comes is intense and absorbing but there's also a number of silly plot holes and a lot of tedious digression, particularly featuring the man and his girlfriend. A lengthy scene in a restaurant/club with a rather folksy band is particularly irrelevant. It is strikingly similar to one in 'The French Connection', featuring - I think - The Three Degrees, before Diana Ross got too big for her brassiere. But that scene was at least pertinent to the story. Both movies also feature a slightly off-the-beam cop and a reckless car chase.'Bullitt' was serious action and attitude in its day, but 40 years have tended to put it into perspective, making it seem a little tame. 'Ronin' still features the most imaginative and aggressive car chases screened, I think.It's well worth a watch, but McQueen is the principal reason for that. During a recent viewing I kept thinking how much better this or that could have been if only...and if only... But - unlike modern movies of the genre - 'Bullitt' had no particular peers or standards to better, so there was no need to be more imaginative in the directing or editing. For 1968, it was right on the money.What it does do is make you realise how much a fairly basic movie can be enhanced by a really charismatic actor in the starring role. Imagine 'Puppet On A Chain' with Steve McQueen as the good guy.It's nice to see sunlit 'Frisco' from the Haight/Ashley vintage, McQueen's steely good-looks and that wonderful roaring muscle-car. Those are real gems, but the rest of the settings are paste.",Bullitt
93,coltras35,Cop thriller gem featuring the daddy of car chases,8,26 April 2021,"Steve McQueen oozes supercool as Frank Bullitt, a tough police detective assigned to protect a Mob witness for 48 hours, only for hitmen to find their hiding place and try to silence the informant. Bullitt realises something does not add up and goes in search of both the killers and whoever told them where to locate their target - but an ambitious politician ( well played by Robert Vaughn) wants him off the case.A highly influential film, not just for the exhilarating car chase in the wavy streets of San Francisco, but for the no-nonsense, rebellious persona of the protagonist. Dirty Harry et al followed suit not too long later. McQueen is at his deadpan best, and does some good stunts such as the ear-quaking scene where he lies beneath a Boeing 727 passenger jet, starting out for take-off as he pursues the bad guy in the airport. On the negative side, the film can be a bit slow and the plot a little complex, however those are minor points. It's a classic cop thriller.",Bullitt
94,DJAkin,Best Car Chase,10,14 June 2008,"I loved this movie and it is certainly a man's movie! The way Steve McQueen played it cool and didn't take any guff was classic. He was not tough in terms of shooting or fighting during this movie. He was simply tough in a calm way as he carried out his assignment in San Francisco.One of the best parts was during that car chase!! The folks that Steve McQueen were chasing were the most calm and professional hit men ever! That guy driving was wearing a tie and his passenger, the older bald man was calm and collective despite them driving around San Francisco at 90 miles per hour! The other strange thing is that these two guys never even spoke to each other as Steve McQueen was chasing them!Great movie overall!",Bullitt
95,sme_no_densetsu,An above average cop flick featuring a classic car chase,7,29 March 2010,"""Bullitt"" is mostly notable for its classic car chase through the streets of San Francisco. Even today there are folks who consider it the greatest cinematic car chase of all time. But that's not all that the movie has going for it.The legendary Steve McQueen plays Frank Bullitt, a no-nonsense San Francisco cop whom an ambitious politician tasks with guarding a star witness. When an attempt is made on the star witness's life Bullitt determines to get to the bottom of it no matter what it takes.McQueen capably carries the picture and he even did most of his own stunts. Robert Vaughn, however, turned in the film's best performance as the suave but manipulative Walter Chalmers. Meanwhile, Jacqueline Bisset stars as the requisite love interest. The remainder of the cast is dependable as well and includes some familiar faces like Norman Fell & Robert Duvall.Peter Yates's direction is stylish and suits the film well, as does Lalo Schifrin's jazzy score. It's also worth noting that the film won an Oscar for its editing, which I wouldn't argue with. However, one of the film's weaknesses is a script that's vague almost to the point of confusing the viewer.All in all, though, ""Bullitt"" is a solid cop drama that's a cut above most films of its ilk. It may not have quite the same impact today that it had back in 1968 but it remains a worthwhile film. If nothing else, it's a must-see for the iconic chase scene alone.",Bullitt
96,PimpinAinttEasy,Lalo Schifrin's score was wasted on this film .....,7,21 January 2014,"Except for the car chase, this film has not aged very well. The pace is too slow at times almost as if the director was pulling a few punches. It is still a decent police procedural with one of the greatest car chases of all time. And the director made a big mistake not extracting the immense potential of LALO SCHIFRIN's brilliant background score which must rank as one of the greatest of all time. We only get lame subdued versions of this great soundtrack in the film.STEVE MCQUEEN is his usual subdued self, maybe a bit too subdued at times. I guess it is one of those big American films of the 60s. But PETER YATES is no Peckinpah. Sure, some of the scenes are tough as nails but parts of it were boring and unnecessarily complicated. JACQUELINE BISSET is nice to look at. There is a young ROBERT DUVALL in the movie.Once again, real shame that the soundtrack wasn't put to better use. I wonder what LALO SCHIFRIN thought about the way it was used in the movie.(7/10)",Bullitt
97,seymourblack-1,"Intriguing, Intelligent & Influential",9,31 August 2011,"""Bullitt"" is a classic crime thriller with a legendary car chase, an absorbing plot and a level of realism that makes it compelling to watch. It cleverly combines thrills, action and excitement with intrigue, intelligence and subtlety and features a hero who, for his time, was very atypical. The visual style of the movie is particularly dark and the toughness of its characters is emphasised by their no-frills dialogue.After a witness is flown down to San Francisco from Chicago to testify against the Mafia in a Senate Committee hearing which is due to be held in a few days time, Detective Lieutenant Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) is assigned to the task of protecting the informant. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) had personally selected Bullitt for the job and is determined to ensure that nothing untoward happens to the witness who is introduced as Johnny Ross (Felice Orlandi).Bullitt arranges for Ross to be hidden out in a cheap grade hotel and given 24 hour protection but shortly after putting these arrangements in place both Ross and one of Bullitt's colleagues are gunned down by two hit men. Senator Chalmers is furious and determined that Bullitt should be punished. Bullitt, however, is convinced that there is something very suspicious about the circumstances of the shooting which left the two men critically injured and pursues the remainder of the investigation on his own.Throughout his investigation Bullitt continues to be harassed and threatened by Chalmers but eventually it's his checks into the background of Johnny Ross that uncover the information which proves to be critical in bringing the case to a satisfactory conclusion.""Bullitt"" is widely credited as having had a powerful influence on the type of crime thrillers which were made in the years immediately following its release and Steve McQueen's character is also seen as a template for the large number of ""maverick cops"" who would later become such a familiar staple of the genre.The movie's famous car chase which ends spectacularly, is exciting, brilliantly choreographed and skilfully edited. It stands up extremely well by contemporary standards and clearly merits all the praise that it's been given over the years.The level of realism seen in ""Bullitt"" is impressive and was achieved by using techniques which had previously been employed in docu-noirs and Italian neo-realist movies in the years following World War 11. Meticulous attention was paid to researching police and medical procedures so that they could be depicted as accurately as possible and the use of medical and police staff as extras ensured that the on-screen action looked as authentic as possible.Frank Bullitt is a man whose emotions appear to have been numbed by his experience of having to confront violence and crime on a daily basis but there are occasions when his real feelings become more obvious e.g. when he's with his girlfriend Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) and when he accompanies his injured colleague to hospital. His manner is generally cool and rather aloof but his level of determination is also obvious as he stays totally focused on his pursuit of the criminals despite all the pressure and threats that he routinely has to endure. The extraordinarily charismatic McQueen is faultless and totally convincing in portraying the various aspects of Bullitt's complex character.There are a number of good supporting performances but the one that stands out comes from Robert Vaughn who excels as the despicable Senator whose ambition and arrogance have made him completely corrupt and self serving.""Bullitt"" is thoroughly entertaining, very memorable and undoubtedly deserves its classic status.",Bullitt
98,Richie-67-485852,Speeding Bullitt,10,11 September 2017,"Good quality entertainment. It fits the detective murder mystery adventure genre like a glove keeping us glued to the screen. Helping this along is no other than Steve McQueen who just looks good in movies. A good story, some fine directing and a decent supporting cast and you have an enjoyable two hours on your hands. Who wouldn't want one of those cars after seeing the case scenes in this movie BTW. I like police drama where the badge is a privilege but also a hindrance in doing what needs to be done. In this movie, the law is respected and kept to forcing the star to use his wits and just good ole fashioned police work to prevail and win the day against a very smart perpetrator. That's why this works but only for its time. Today, rules are bent, waived and eyes are closed and authorities do what they want when they want hiding behind the law sad but true more often than not. Think dirty Harry and how popular that became when he tried to tread that fine line but crossed it when he had to. Good movie for a TV dinner and a tasty drink while watching. There is a TV dinners scene in the movie. Too bad Steve didn't milk this character of his called Bullitt as it would have done for him what the Dirty Harry series did for Eastwood. It was a good formula ahead of its time.",Bullitt
99,Karl Self,Stylish,8,25 March 2008,"Bullitt is not just an exercise in style, it really set the pace for crime movies up until now and for a long time to come. There are moments when you wish you could be like them -- so slick like that informer with the yellow glasses, so arrogant and controlled like that politician, so cool and hardboiled like McQueen, and (for women) so stroppy and dollish like Bisset. And McQueen really is something else. He may not be the most muscular, or the most handsome or the wittiest. But he could give a lesson in cool to Bogart on the North Pole. He is so much the impersonation of fine manhood and controlled aggressiveness that he would give aged dykes the vapours. Legions of genre actors after him have tried to outdo him, and they were more photogenic, or had ten times his muscle volume or better dialogue. But still they couldn't touch him. So Bullitt is one of those movies that is worth watching just because it is a landmark. It's like a lesson from your master on the hilltop.I wish I'd have seen it on the big screen, because that would have allowed me to just sink right in. But unfortunately the story is a bit sucky and has holes larger than the craters of Hawaii. I wasn't aware of that beforehand, and it distracted me because I tried to figure the movie out. It also annoyed me because I really enjoy a clever story, but no dice. So, just dive in, put your logic thinking on hold but let your emotions flow the way McQueen drives his car -- full throttle.",Bullitt
100,drjgardner,Doesn't stand the test of time,4,31 January 2019,"I saw Bullitt when it came pout and I thought it was great- Steve McQueen, car chases, sleezy politicians, and the beautiful city of San Francisco. Did I mention the car chase? Looking at it 50 years later I'm disappointed. Like so many films it doesn't stand the test of time, partly because there have been so many better films since. Yes. I know you have to evaluate a film in its context and I'm able to do that with silent films and films from the 30s and 40s. When I first rated Bullitt I gave it an 8 and now I give it a 4. Here are some reasons - Bullitt seems incompetent. His witness gets attacked and attacked again. Without meaning to kill all the suspects, he does it, which seems incompetent rather than deadly. He does manage to survive the car chase, but it's hardly his skill at driving. If you haven't seen it in a while, don't. Keep your cherished memory. But if you're going to see it for the first time, don't expect a lot.",Bullitt
101,one9eighty,More than just a Mustang vs Charger film - this is a lesson in how to do a cool cop gone rogue film,9,29 June 2020,"Steve McQueen is San Francisco cop, Lieutenant Frank Bullitt. He is charged with keeping Johnny Ross safe, a Chicago mobster who is going to turn in evidence against his underworld employers. It has all been organised by up-and-coming politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn), who's career is about to take him to the top of San Francisco's political sphere. As events unfold, Bullitt feels that something isn't right, so he takes matters into his own hands.This is a cool cop gone rogue film, in fact it's one of THE cool cop gone rogue films. McQueen's portrayal of Bullitt came well before the likes of Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman in The French Connection), Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy in Beverley Hills Cop), Jack Carter (Michael Caine in Get Carter), Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon) John McClain (Bruce Willis in Die Hard), ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry)... before Chuck Norris went rogue, before Steven Segal kicked ass, before the Equalizer went off the map, before these and many many more too.A lot of people wrongly assume this is an out-and-out car chase film. It's true that there is an epic Mustang vs Charger chase, but there is a whole lot more to this move.As Bullitt, McQueen is gritty and tough, he's cool and uncompromising. The supporting cast all do great jobs; Vaughn is charismatic but also sleazy and untrustworthy; Don Gordon (Bullitt's long suffering by trusty partner) gives a great account of himself as both hard-working and tired at the same time - but totally committed to his partner; Simon Oakland is great as Bullitt's boss Captain Bennet, who knows well enough to trust his maverick lieutenant. Even minor characters deliver decent performances; Robert Duvall is great as a straight to the point Taxi driver; Jacquline Bisset as Bullitt's love interest is relatively naïve to the world her man lives in (at first anyway); even newcomer Georg Stanford Brown is great as overworked and underappreciated Dr Willard who sees in Bullitt somebody he can trust to get justice.Directed by British born Peter Yates, this American cop film feels more European in its stylistic approach, with its wonderful jazzy soundtrack (courtesy of Lalo Schifrin) and well-constructed cinematography. This film feels like it could be right out of London's colourful and hip swinging sixties, a testament to what Yates and the production team have created. You won't find many special effects here like you would in modern films, this stylish film relies on a good plot and good old-fashioned techniques to deliver itself to the audiences. It doesn't rely on blowing everything to pieces, there aren't hundreds of cars piling up, there aren't random twists for the sake of it - just realistic outcomes, real situations and consequences (the later of which seems to be missing from modern rogue cop films). One of the things that McQueen insisted on, and Peter Yates was fully supportive or and behind too, was authenticity; the streets are real, the car chase are real, the locations were real, characters aren't all superheroes that can be shot to pieces but still run marathons - no studio settings, no CGI car chases (FTR this is still one of the fastest ""Mansell Road chases ever filmed, and there have now been a fair few!). This authenticity led to McQueen losing a 6-movie contract but stood him up as a true artistic vehicle for this film and others too. The long-standing appeal of the film has earned a lot of credit for Peter Yates and Steve McQueen for sticking to their artistic integrity and doing things the old-school way.If you come to this film purely for the Mustang vs Charger chase you will be disappointed, this film is much much more than that - character development, a decent plot, twists, action, adventure, emotions. Even by today's standards it's a great film... in fact the only thing that would be different if you take this film out of the 60's and put it into today's market is that they would have smart phones and as such might not need to make as many stops to public phones.Bullitt is a great film and I'd highly recommend it to others, whether you are looking for a film for a lazy Sunday, or an action film for a Friday night - Bullitt is definite go-to film. 9 out of 10.",Bullitt
102,jhclues,The Ultimate McQueen,10,15 September 2000,"**Possible Spoilers**	In all of his twenty-six movies, Steve McQueen only played a cop once, and when he did, it was a good one.  In `Bullitt,' directed by Peter Yates, McQueen is Detective Lieutenant Frank Bullitt of the San Francisco P.D.  Politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) is bringing in a witness from Chicago who is scheduled to testify in a trial that promises to have a devastating effect on the crime hierarchy of the Windy City. If all goes as planned, it promises to have a substantial effect of Chalmers' political career, as well.  He hand-picks Bullitt and his partner, Delgetti (Don Gordon), to guard the witness, Johnny Ross (Pat Renella), whose testimony is to be the key element of the prosecution. Without Ross, they have no case.  But Ross' co-operation turns out to be a set up.  The `Ross' who shows up in San Francisco and is promptly sequestered away in a hotel by Bullitt, is really a man named Renick (Felice Orlandi), paid to stand in for Ross, and never intended to make it to the trial.  Renick thinks he's to be sprung for a long vacation in Rome, but the whole scam quickly goes bad; Renick ends up dead, and the third man of Bullitt's team, Stanton (Carl Reindel) winds up in the hospital, lucky to be alive after being on the receiving end of a shotgun blast. 	McQueen gives one of his best performances as the stoic and uncompromising Bullitt, the cop who's seen it all and who has no delusions as to the state of the world in which he lives, nor of its seemingly endless capacity for evil.  In one scene, he goes to a motel for what he believes will be a routine follow-up on a tip, a name and address that's surfaced during his investigation.  It's a nice day and a long drive, so his girlfriend, Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) accompanies him; a rare chance to spend some time together.  What he finds at the motel, however, instead of information on a name, is a particularly gruesome homicide.  And before he can stop her, Cathy walks in on it.  Ultimately, she is just as appalled by Bullitt's jaded reaction to such a heinous sight, as by the murder itself.  She asks him how he can stand it, spending so much of his time in the gutter. `That's where half of it is,' he tells her. 	Written by Alan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner (adapted from Robert L. Pike's novel, `Mute Witness'), the plot is fairly complex, and Yates keeps the tension high throughout.  There's plenty of action, highlighted by a car chase through the city, that finally winds up in the countryside.  McQueen did his own driving in this sequence, which is possibly the best ever filmed, and it set the standard for the entire industry ever since.  McQueen in that Mustang, bouncing over the hills of San Francisco, is an indelible moment in cinematic history. 	The outstanding supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Captain Bennett), Robert Duvall (Weissberg), Norman Fell (Captain Baker), Georg Stanford Brown (Doctor Willard), Justin Tarr (Eddy) and Vic Tayback (Pete Ross).  Gordon is well cast as Delgetti, perfectly complementing McQueen's Bullitt; they make one of the most memorable detective teams ever.  What really makes this movie, though, is McQueen himself.  The cool, no-nonsense persona, and the way he could convey so much with merely an expression; he could speak volumes with a slight nod or a subtle lowering of the eyelids.  Extremely well presented, with an intelligent script and a great cast, `Bullitt' is one of McQueen's best, and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",Bullitt
103,Stampsfightclub,A true crime drama,8,24 August 2008,"In one of the most renowned crime films of the 60's, Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) stars as detective Frank Bullitt, a man assigned to protect Pete Ross, who is due in court in a few days. But Ross is killed and now Bullitt has to track down the murderer and unravel the case.Bullitt is a slick and exciting typical crime drama with great visuals and perhaps the most iconic car chase of the 60's with great direction to match.McQueen's performance is second to none as the intelligent and sophisticated detective Frank Bullitt and this performance by the talented actor brings the plot to life with exquisite timing and smart judgement to the role.The plot is consistent, with only a few lapses and a slightly puzzling cast who all look the same, making the plot a must keep your eye on which actually adds to the fun and surprise of the twists and turns.Having never been around in the 60's and watching it for the first time a few days ago, Bullitt was a surprise to me, with such a vast difference in terms of action compared to modern day crime dramas.With only a couple of chases or action sequences, it is amazing to watch as the plot is so focused upon the plot rather than visual effects and pure gun adrenaline. The stakes have obviously been raised in modern cinema, with the Bond films for example all star driven with plenty of action, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but a film like Bullitt or the Bourne films are so pin point accurate on the plot rather than an overdose in action, which is what films should be about rather than showing everyone what they can do with technology.The car chase is very exciting and even knocks out modern day chases with the direction so good.There are a few lapses and the similar looking cast had me scratching my head a few times but Bullitt is a sophisticated crime drama that uses the genre to its advantage and doesn't overuse action to make a gritty well established film.",Bullitt

A San Francisco police detective (Steve McQueen) conceals the death of a Mob witness in his charge, and goes after the killer himself.Bullitt is a cop thriller with undoubted charisma, distinguished by what is arguably the greatest car chase in films, with Frank's Ford Mustang tearing up and down the vertiginous hills of San Francisco for nine minutes (at the time of the film's release, the car chase scene generated a great amount of excitement). Otherwise, it's brisk and efficient, with McQueen commanding as usual in the title role. In 2004, The New York Times placed the film on its list of The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made.",Bullitt

Only Bogie and John Wayne were cinematic tough guys before Frank Bullitt came along, and it was Bullitt that inspired Dirty Harry and every rogue cop movie as a result. If you were looking for the first modern cop thriller, well here it is. Accept no substitutes. In today's over-blown and effects laden (for better of for worse) era, people often forget that all those films began with movies like this one.The story has Lieutenant Frank Bullitt receiving an assignment to protect a star witness in a high profile case that could bring down a powerful crime organization. Bullitt and his men take turns guarding the witness, but before long there is a hit and the witness is mortally wounded, and Bullitt takes the case into his own hands. The resulting mystery is both Grade-A Hollywood entertainment (rare these days) and a believable character portrait of a man engulfed by his work in a cruel world.Of course one cannot talk about his movie without mentioning the legendary car chase, which is one of the best out there, but is not the main part of the movie as many make it out to be. If you see this movie just for some pedal to the medal action you will be let down. The focus of the movie is on Bullitt and the car chase, while very exciting and fun to watch, is one of the many scenes that show Bullitt's near obsession to work. Unlike today's crap action movies there is no 37 car pile up, no cars flipping over simply because the bad guys are driving them.Also the finale of the film, a foot chase at an airport, has our hero firing two shots from his pistol and that is the only time he uses it in the movie. This film demonstrates that action is best when the result of a character's emotions and not a director's ambition to blow stuff up. Bullitt wants to get the bottom of the case, he wants to find out who's been following him around town and that is the result of the action scenes. In the end the film is a true classic and Frank Bullitt is a character to remember. 10/10Rated PG: violence (though if it were released today, it probably would get a PG-13)",Bullitt

Although McQueen didn't really have to stretch beyond his already established screen persona, he is perfect in the role. He is Bullitt like Connery is Bond. Maybe the role was tailored specifically for him. He also has Jacqueline Bisset (Cathy), who can more than hold her own with any Bond girl, to come home to! She adds a welcome domestic quality and the audience feels relieved that despite the unforgiving profession Bullitt works in, at least he has a good woman at his side. The location photography in beautiful San Francisco, the to-the-letter accurate procedural dialogue, the political infighting with the smarmy D.A.

McQueen was never cooler as a cop who has to deal with egotistical administrators as well as murderous mobsters.Let's cut to the chase - this was the one car chase that stands alone. Nothing else comes close. From the tense jazz score being played that leads up to the moment where the hit-man in the Charger snaps his seat belt into place. The music stops and you're treated to a harrowing, rubber burning car chase through heavy traffic in the streets of San Francisco. I know - the green VW is passed four times, indicating the same shot was made from four different angles - who cares? It worked! As a native San Franciscan, I tried all those flying car stunts as a teenager driving my '64 Impala. Luckily, I never bottomed out or hurt anybody with my foolishness. I wouldn't recommend it - if a cop saw me, I would have done time. This was back in 1970, when things were a little looser regarding law enforcement.Bullitt is mainly a classic because of McQueen. He was understated and intense. The film had an aura about it that made you believe in it. Steve McQueen and his Mustang will forever be immortal.",Bullitt
109,anselmdaniel,A cool intense thriller,8,16 February 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Bullitt is an action thriller movie directed by Peter Yates. The movie is based off of a novel named Mute Witness by Robert L. Fish. The movie stars Steve McQueen as Lieutenant Frank Bullitt. The movie is about an investigation in the city of San Francisco.Bullitt is a movie that is incredibly focused. The entire movie is from Frank Bullitt's perspective. The audience follows him as he uncovers the mystery in San Francisco. The audience feels his struggle and intuitions completely. This makes the movie much more grounded than other movies. There is an absolute amount of tension that the movie has from its basis in reality. I did not find anything about the movie that felt too contrived or difficult to understand.This movie has gorgeous sets and backdrops. The entire movie feels authentic as each scene feels realistic. The movie does have these sets that feel authentic to the location of San Francisco. Even the props that the movie has a great feeling visually and audibly. I did not see a problem in this movie's direction or production. It felt that the movie put much of its effort into these components.The movie has great action. There is not much action here but the action present feels realistic and thrilling. The biggest stand-out scene is the chase through San Francisco. The movie had a great lead-up to this moment and it also had a great impact on the rest of the movie. The movie had a great scene in the chase and Steve McQueen acts well in the scene.Bullitt is recommended. The movie boasts great visuals and action. The movie is able to make the action feel authentic which is the highest praise I can give to an action movie. However, the movie can feel incredibly slow at its 113 minute running time.Grade: B",Bullitt
110,virek213,"McQueen at his best, on or off the streets of San Francisco",9,24 October 2001,"Steve McQueen gave perhaps his greatest performance here in this memorable 1968 crime thriller.  He plays a San Francisco cop assigned by a publicity hound of a politician (Robert Vaughn) to protect a mob witness for the weekend.  But when two men break in to the hotel where the mob witness is staying and kill not only the witness but wound one of McQueen's partners, it is McQueen who must find the men that did this while keeping Vaughn off his back.Getting information on the dead witness' history, with ties to the Organization in Chicago, McQueen soon spots the killers--and thus ensues the screen's most hair-raising and thunderous car chase ever!  Although the two mob killers bite the dust at the end of the chase, McQueen soon learns that the witness who died at the hotel was a decoy, and that the real witness is about ready to leave the country.  This results in an expertly paced climax at San Francisco International Airport.With solid support from actors like Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, and Simon Oakland, McQueen makes the most of his role in a totally low-key fashion, as was his custom.  British director Peter Yates is well on top of both characterization and action, aided by the Oscar-winning editing of Frank Keller, and a superlative score by master composer Lalo Schifrin.  That crazy car chase up and down the hills of San Francisco remains one of Hollywood's ultimate action set-pieces, but there is more to BULLITT than just that.  See it as being a solid example of how good crime dramas can be made on the big screen without a profuse spilling of blood, and with plenty of charismatic performances, particularly McQueen's.",Bullitt
111,RossRivero99,A must see,10,28 December 2014,"Peter Yates' Bullitt is arguably one of the greatest police movies ever made as well as one of the best movies of all time in general. The movie stars Steve McQueen as Lt. Frank Bullitt as a tough as nails San Francisco policeman who is asked by Walter Chalmers (played by Robert Vaughn) who is there to hold a hearing at a Senate subcommittee, to protect a Chicago mobster named Johnny Ross (played by Pat Renella) who is going to turn evidence against that organization during the hearing, though Chalmers is constantly asking Bullitt for Ross's safety at all costs or else Bullitt would pay the consequence for not protecting Ross. Bullitt and his 2 other police buddies Sgt. Delgetti (played by Don Gordon), and Det. Carl Stanton (played by Carl Reindel) end up putting Ross in protective custody for 2 days until the hearing, meanwhile his superior officer Capt. Samuel Bennett (played by Simon Oakland) ends up giving Bullitt full authority of the case. The chase scene in this film reminded me of the chase scene in the French Connection (1971) but the chase scene in this movie a lot more entertaining and lasts much longer, and the neatest thing about the chase scene in this film is at first Bullitt knows that he is being followed by the Hit-man who supposedly killed Ross and then he starts chasing him for an 11 minute time period, the difference in the chase scene in Friedkin's film is that the Gene Hackman character chases the criminal underneath a railroad track for a short period of time and the one in this film I won't repeat again. McQueen gives his best performance since both The Magnificent Seven (1960), and the Great Escape (1963), and Robert Vaughn is also perfectly cast as the extremely annoying character who constantly ""demands"" that Bullitt gives him his dead witness, and also Peter Yates was a great choice to direct this film, as well as Robert Duvall as the taxi driver, it is a great film.",Bullitt

While it doesn't add up to much more than the sum of its parts, its parts are plenty fine. You can hardly avoid mentioning the iconic car chase, and a fantastic car chase it is, too. It draws inspiration from THE LINEUP, and really the movie as a whole would be right at home among some of the better police procedural films noir. There's more to the movie than just the chase, though, and I can't think of a scene that felt superfluous or boring. It also avoids a lot of the ""rogue cop"" clichés and doesn't feel too predictable. Good times.",Bullitt

116,romanorum1,"The Thug Fastens His Seat Belt, the Signal for the Clash of the Muscle Cars",7,19 May 2014,"Along with the opening credits there is the preliminary scene that tells us that tough folks are after Johnny Ross (Pat Renella). The strategic use of shadows ensures that we see just flashes of Ross' face. Not long after, San Francisco homicide detective Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) is handpicked by ambitious politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) to protect Ross, a star witness who is about to bring damaging testimony to a subcommittee against a criminal Chicago syndicate (but in California?). Chalmers cares only about his own political position while Bullitt's interest is doing his job. When Bullitt checks out Ross' hotel room (as arranged by Chalmers), he is concerned for two reasons (1) large windows overlook the fast-moving freeway that appears to be located just a few feet away from the building, and (2) the easily-accessible fire escape along the side of the structure. Since Bullitt recommends no room changes, the viewer may assume that the hotel is booked. Also there is no thought to moving the witness to another hotel (Are they all occupied?). Nevertheless, shortly thereafter the witness is shot-gunned to death after he inexplicably unlocks the door, summoning in the killers. But Why? And Obviously someone in Chalmers' office ratted out Ross's whereabouts. The always-interfering Chalmers incredibly blames Bullitt. But the ultra-cool detective in turn is determined to get to the truth. And Chalmers may be a bit surprised when he discovers the facts. Bullitt is ably assisted by Sergeant Delgetti (Don Gordon). Another one of Bullitt's team is Stanton (Carl Reindel), but he is wounded early on when Ross is killed, and is knocked out of commission. Why was he not also bumped off, as he could provide some identify about the assassins?Bullitt eventually picks up information about the two hit-men that killed Ross; he dubs them ""shotgun and backup man."" Subsequently, the ten-minute highly intense car chase towards the end becomes the film's highlight. When ""backup man"" clicks his seat belt we know that we will see the greatest auto pursuit ever filmed (up to that time). It's the 1968 Ford Mustang 390 GT vs. the Dodge Charger 440 Magnum. I still remember someone in a theater in long-ago Joliet, Illinois excitedly saying, ""He just ran a Stop Sign at high speed."" In fact, speeds exceeded 100 MPH! McQueen did some of his own driving and even crashed once. Will the bad boys wind up in hell? See it and find out! This chase is nothing like in-studio computer enhanced imagery. No sir, by golly!There is an exciting climax at San Francisco International Airport after a Pan American flight to Rome is recalled to its perch. It's the only sequence where the brooding Bullitt uses his pistol, and he takes only two shots. He had a one-word response for Chalmers when the latter says, ""Frank, we must all compromise."" In only the silver screen's first or second use of the word: Bullitt replies, ""Bull****!""Steve McQueen's character is modeled after real-life San Francisco Homicide Inspector Dave Toschi. McQueen, who lived in the fast lane and died at just age 50, made less than 30 movies. Only once was he a cop. His early fame was in the TV western series, ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" (1958-1961, as Josh Randall). McQueen's silver screen break-in roles were in ""Never So Few"" (as Bill Ringa, 1959) and ""The Magnificent Seven"" (as Vin Tanner, 1960). He may not be Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Gregory Peck, or Stacy Keach. But Steve McQueen, like many actors (like Humphrey Bogart, Randolph Scott, and Lee Marvin), built his screen characters effectively around himself: he ""projected"" his presence. He is very successful in ""Bullitt,"" perhaps his greatest role. Jacqueline Bisset as his girlfriend Cathy has three distinct scenes, none of which exceeds three or four minutes screen time: (1) at the architectural studio, (2) at breakfast, and (3) leaving her car with Steve after leaving the hotel in disgust. She makes little sense each time except for one brief line: ""What will happen to us in time?"" ""Time starts now,"" replies Bullitt. Her last ""major"" scene is totally preposterous. She criticizes Frank's police world, but lady, he is a homicide detective! Like, what did you really expect? Egad!!! Obviously the screenwriters take the bulk of the blame (Trustman, Kleiner, and Fish). On the other hand, Bisset is not actually a great actress, like a Barbara Stanwyck or Meryl Streep. She has physical beauty, but like so many ""actresses"" (Ann-Margret, Raquel Welch, Vanity) she really cannot cut the mustard, so to speak. Robert Vaughn plays the incompetent and odious politician, and Norman Fell is his creepy sidekick captain. Simon Oakland has a nice supporting role as police captain Sam Bennett, who is generally behind Bullitt.As the mood is well-set, the movie has little dialog. Of course, on-location filming in a great city is always a plus. In real life police procedure is not fast-moving. So, despite its slow pace the movie is realistic (even with Bullitt's over-the-top exploits at the airport). Notwithstanding some of the flaws already mentioned, this 1960s drama packs a wallop.",Bullitt

No Question!,8,18 September 2004,"BULLIT (4 outta 5 stars)Well, it's a classic... what can you say about a classic... it NEEDS to be seen, that's all. Well-paced, exciting and much-imitated cop movie starring tough-guy icon Steve McQueen in probably his best role. He is the hip, cool, slightly rebellious cop who knows his job better than anybody... even though everyone else takes great delight in telling him what he's doing wrong. The story might seem pretty routine by today's standards... an important witness is under police protection as all sorts of bad men try to kill him... but the story moves at a brisk, no-nonsense pace. A few bloody gun battles are scattered throughout... and, of course, midway through the movie you have THE GREATEST CAR CHASE EVER PUT ON FILM! (Yeah, yeah, you might *think* you know a better one... but this is the one that every subsequent action movie tries to top... and can never quite do it.) McQueen was big into racing cars at the time... and reportedly he did most of his own driving... so keep that in mind as you see his little Mustang take those wild corners and high jumps.",Bullitt

Either that or it's so brilliant and subtle I'm missing the mysterious and brilliant point. But I doubt it.I won't get into the plot because you need to figure out the story for yourself but I can tell you this; there are many scenes which are quite tedious. Take The French Connection. It also has scenes that are low key and dry but there is still something interesting about what is happening and you know it all leads to something important. Not here. Watching a plane taxi around on the runway is about as interesting as watching a snail travel along a leaf. Come on! Boring.Also, some of the post dubbing is just off kilter enough to be noticeable. So is some of the sound added post production. Why can't they fix that?Steve McQueen. Yes, super cool dude with the dazzling blue eyes. I get it, I get it. I agree however, even he can't save some of the scenes here which don't really rise above average and deliver any punch! And his reaction shots only go so far in keeping us interested. The film just never really evolves or expands into any type of climax that becomes nail biting. You could doze through this and not miss anything important. I don't hate the film.

121,rowmorg,Dumbest cop in movie history?,5,24 October 2008,"Other reviewers here have raved about this script and its powerful realism, but I contend that Lieutenant Bullit must be the dumbest cop in movie history. He single-handedly destroys the feds' case against the Mafia, thereby putting back the fight against organised crime by many years.Blunder 1. Bullitt makes no attempt to ID the man he is assigned to protect, supposedly Johnny Ross, a mafioso rip-off artist, but actually Renick, a stand-in that Ross somehow (we're never told how) arranged to take his place. Bullitt could have saved himself a load of trouble by simply asking the guy for his driver's licence. Du-u-uh! Blunder 2. Bullitt could have positioned his Detective-Sergeant on a chair behind the door of the hotel room, instead of opposite it, so that ""Ross"" a) could not surreptitiously unchain the door, and b) if by chance he did, the officer would not be directly in the line of fire of an entering hit-man and get his leg blown away. (Again, only the scriptwriters know why ""Ross"" took the chain off the door.) Blunder 3. Bullitt, assigned to protect a high-value witness against the Mob, fails to secure a police walkie-talkie with which to communicate with his police team on this important weekend job. Yes, police officers used walkie-talkies in the 1960s. That way, Bullitt could have had back-up on his lone dash through the hospital after the hit-man.Blunder 4. Ditto for the second long, lonely night-time sprint, this time across S.F. Int'l airport runway, involving a spectacular dive beneath an oncoming jumbo jet.Blunder 5. During his incredibly dangerous car-chase, Bullitt fails to use the walkie-talkie (the one he forgot to borrow from HQ) to call a helicopter to follow the suspects' car, as a result of which oversight, he incinerates the hit-man beyond recognition, ending any hope of tracing him back to his Chicago bosses. Way to go, dude! Blunder 6. Here's the summit of Bullitt's comic stupidity: in the airport concourse, he shoots the star witness to death, thereby depriving Uncle Sam's case against the Mafia of its once-in-a-lifetime star witness. This climactic blunder should have caused Bullitt to be assigned to traffic detail for the rest of his service.Where on earth did this incredibly dumb movie hero get his prestigious reputation? For me, he's a figure of comedy. Behind Bullitt's brilliant blue eyes is the IQ of Forrest Gump.",Bullitt
122,Mort-31,How to get an Oscar easily,4,3 March 2001,"In 1969, Bullitt` won the Academy Award for best editing. The jurors, I supposed, were particularly impressed by one excellent sequence of nearly ten minutes, where a car chase is shown in a quite exciting way. This was the scene the movie was made for and, really, it was the best-cut car chase I've ever seen in a movie.I think the producer of this film had hopes of an Oscar and wanted to receive it with as little financial and intellectual expenditure as possible. He employed a screenwriter who was just tired to write dialogues, then he looked for a routine director to drag it out. The whole team concentrated on the car chase scene and everything else was rather irrelevant. The problem was that for being nominated they had to bring the movie into the theaters and let at least some people watch it who would then go out and say: What a great car chase!` and maybe: I like Steve McQueen`.The result is boredom and the irony is that you may happen to fall asleep before the good scene.

123,kgprophet,The film that started all the rogue detective movies,8,29 November 2004,"...and all the car chase movies in the 70's. On the surface, this film may bore modern audiences. It lacks wall-to-wall action, or other wildly dramatic scenes. But this landmark film from 1968 was the first to launch the ""good cop working against the system"" film, that was later stolen for the ""Dirty Harry"" movies as well as countless other ones. I myself saw this originally when I was about 5 years old, and was entranced at the utter integrity of this film. Feeling like a documentary, the film is shot without glamorous settings, and Steve McQueen rarely shows any emotion. Instead, he personifies the type of person who has become numb to the ugliness around him. But he doesn't say crap like ""Make my day"". He is curt and to the point. The film follows him as he does the routine type of investigation into a murder. We marvel at the progress he makes, using nuts and bolts techniques to discover clues. This film also made efforts not to glorify violence, instead displaying the horrible effects that result. Of course, this film is well known for another first in a major motion picture - a well choreographed car chase scene. Terrific camera angles, stunts performed at high speeds, and loud sound effects make it still one of the best car chases ever filmed. But one car chase does not a whole film make. Since that original viewing about 24 years ago, I never tire watching this well made movie. The music by Lalo Shifrin is also very cool. This film is part of a trilogy of sorts by producer Philip D'Antoni. Both the films ""The French Connection"" and ""The Seven Ups"" features hair-raising car chases designed by the same stunt coordinator. They also feature cops working in a gritty environment and follow somewhat boring aspects of police work. But when the action starts, it is heart-pounding, because we are heavily involved in the story.Since I was a kid, Steve McQueen became my hero after watching this movie. He is cool, calculated, smart, and sticks up for himself. Now I hear they are doing a remake, as well as reviving the Mustang car that McQueen drove in the film. I'm sure the remake will be a waste of time, similar to other remakes they have made in the unoriginal Hollywood movie world these days. The response is the same to all - Psycho, Stepford Wives, Manchurian Candidate, etc. Why Bother? These were classic films that are entrenched in history. I give this film an 8 out of 10.",Bullitt
124,jayjaycee,McQueen is the king of the streets!,8,5 February 2020,"""Bullitt"" is a 1968 action thriller directed by Peter Yates starring Steve McQueen and Robert Vaughn. Ages before Vin Diesel and his family conquered the big screen with overstated car races and reckless stunt driving, there was this one scene in this classic that still holds the title as one of the greatest vehicle chase sequence of all time (in the context of its time, of course). That's the reason I was encouraged to give it a watch and as I saw this beautiful steelbook edition for a cheap price on Amazon, I could not resist to fasten my seatbelt and go full throttle with it. Surprisingly though, the film didn't do it consequently. In the beginning, it's actually a slow burner that built up some pace and then went back to being slow. There's a specific scheme it follows as it changes from high velocity scenes to tranquil sequences and I'm both satisfied and unsatisfied with it, because sometimes it created a perfectly balanced and unique tension, but at times it also impeded the same development as it happened too fast. But that happened like only two or three times. In general, this feeling wasn't as catastrophic as it sound, because Steve McQueen was there to make it up for it. This was the first time I've seen the legend in a film and I do now understand why he was so popular. He's extremely charismatic, but he has a particular kind of charisma, he's more of a stoic guy who dominates the scenes with his sheer coolness and not by being this macho type of guy. As the titular hero Frank Bullitt he gave a decent performance in this multi-layered plot. What surprised me the most was the twist in the end that I seriously didn't see coming at all, also the ending I would definitely consider as a bad ending for the character. That was magnificent screenwriting and it has also shown in the smart dialogues. Oh, and have I mentioned how graphically brutal it is for the 60s standards? I mean, close up shots of shotgun wounds, shot victims and intense ICU scenes didn't happen so often then, right? Furthermore, there's this legendary car chase sequence I'd consider as the best one of the whole film. It's built up perfectly with a smooth score, but as it starts it the music stops. So, there's nothing else but tires screeching and motors howling for the following minutes and the fact that it takes place in the rough streets of San Francisco makes it even more intense. The stunt drivers really did a fantastic job and showed some damn impressive maneuvers. All in all, this is a colourful and moody thriller that scores through it's well elaborated screenplay, the action sequences in the atmospheric venue of SF and the presence of it's protagonist. It's a classic with some undeniable flaws, but it's still a great pleasure to watch, especially now that it made me an immediate McQueen fan. So glad I bought this film.",Bullitt

What I saw on the screen with the sensibilities of a seventeen year old jingling his birthday money in his pockets and looking for a quick action fix is not now the same movie I deliberate upon with the perspective of advanced age.Back in the sixties, I wanted to be cool and hip and tough with the rest of my teenage compadres, and drive fast cars while I handled tersely and laconically some beautiful babe who was stuck on me, nonetheless harboring feelings of foreboding about my fast and violent lifestyle. Being invited into a dark world of death, danger and adventure running from the mob, dodging bullets, and making a break for the getaway car was enough of a visceral thrill to overrule any cerebral deliberation.But when I think of 'BULLITT' these days, after all the times I have seen our lone, avenging work-a-day cop outwit hit-men sighted in the rear-view mirror of his Mustang to come finally to the ultimate showdown at the Airport; it is the last scene that seems to grow in significance over the years. I can still see Steve McQueen looking up into the mirror at himself and hearing the voice of his eye candy girlfriend in his head intoning ""- what will happen to us in time?"" Or as John Updike wrote in one of his short stories 'THE MUSIC SCHOOL', you can see Bullitt wondering whether or not the man he has become is the man he wished to be...Jacqueline Bisset hardly has any screen time at all, and when you are a teenager barely entering upon the cusp of manhood, the speed of the chase and the adrenaline of the shootouts is enough. But later on, when you have enough life under your belt, you slowly come to realize that there are better ways to cultivate a romantic relationship than confronting situations where injury and death are ever present possibilities. The detective who peers at himself in the mirror at the end of 'BULLITT', is only dimly aware that he has entered upon a process of dehumanization that may well degrade any relationships he has with significant others from here on out into a rote nothingness. For this reviewer to say that this theme is soft-pedaled is probably the classic understatement. This theme is barely hinted at as little more than a seed or glimpse of understanding into a world where class struggle seethes at the outer edges of political civility, and a maverick cop against all odds ends up doing the mob's dirty work for them while solving a crime.Robert Vaughan does his best as Chalmers to attempt to manage the chaos politically, but both he and McQueen seem one step behind the culprits until the final scenes of WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE and the lead character for all his considerable sleuthing comes across simply as a working police detective doing his job. McQueen brought an everyday Joe realism to his character that has stood the test of time since the days of my youth. While McQueen's detective lacks the elegance of reasoning such as would be witnessed with a Sherlock Holmes, or the salty wisecracks of a Phillip Marlowe, the director Peter Yates brings a sense of 'this is how it would be in real life' that feels genuine and human in spite of its melodramatic trappings.The acting, the Jazz score, and the stylistic pacing still make this a great way to spend two hours playing cops and robbers while being cool doing it.",Bullitt
131,dcldan,Very good final scene and nothing more,6,30 December 2006,"Bullit is made to protect a Mafia informant by his boss, a very greed man that only wants to continue with his political career. When the Mafia informant and Bullit's best friend are killed. Bullit decides to find the killers, despite the fact his boss wants to close the case at any price. Most of the film follows all the topics of the criminal movies of the 60's, dark, quite thrilling, with policeman that are not so heroic. It could have been one easily forgettable (it has anything new or specially interesting during most of the film) but for the last 25-minutes-persecution scene. The thrilling the director is able to create, the action is so amazing that the film has gone through the ages and arrived to our time showing us one of the best action scenes ever. The main problem is that this scene is the only good thing in the film. It is recommended to be watched by all action supporters, specially the last scene.",Bullitt
132,brefane,Cut to the chase!,5,25 June 2005,"This movie has a lot going for it: McQueen's charisma,good location photography,competent direction,a celebrated car chase,a catchy score, and a good reputation,...so why is the result so basically dull? The car chase may be a classic but, the film isn't. With a sleek title sequence derived from ""Blowup"" (66), this is not the stylish film it should be:it needs better dialog and tighter pacing. Too many scenes feel like a TV show;the supporting characters are a lackluster bunch, and Jackie Bisset seems out of place and unnecessary. The plot has no distinction, surprise, or real interest: even the chase, viscerally exciting, has no real intensity or strong relation to the plot:its outcome doesn't seem important. It's more about the stunt driving. However, except for that chase,the film is unmemorable. Rent the DVD, cut to the chase, and than watch the extras on Disc 2.",Bullitt
133,Sonatine97,"Over-rated film remembered only for ""that"" car-chase!",7,25 June 2002,"As much as I enjoyed this film, mostly for the car-chase that has been quoted & praised ad infinitum over the years, I have to confess on a more recent DVD viewing that this film is now very dated, suffers from poor characterisation & is a film that will always be remembered because of that car chase and nothing more.McQueen is good in his role as the cool, anti-hero detective and probably influenced latter cop roles from the likes of Clint Eastwood in his Coogan's Bluff/Dirty Harry movies.The support roles, however, are shallow and seem to be trivialised by Yates' apparent lack of interest in enriching us with fleshing out the roles. More so with Robert Vaughn, as the pushy, media-hungry congressman, and McQueen's girlfriend, Jackie Bisset.Bisset's character is so one dimensional and methodical that we learn nothing from her at all apart from a little speech she gives to McQueen about how disensitised he has become to life, reality & other emotive issues because of the nature of his job.But this is badly handled & unconvincing, and reminds me of a similar showdown in the movie Heat with Al Pacino suffering the same criticism from his 3rd wife about putting his job before his family etc. I could never understand why any woman would want to be a wife to such a cop if she isn't prepared to understand and live with the consequences & personal sacrifices such a job requires from cops such as McQueen/Pacino.The story is generally entertaining but seems to be overshadowed and subsequently handicapped by the 10 minute car chase, which is a great pity. The chase itself was amazing for its time, but in more contemporary times, we see it as being ""just ok!"".I wasn't too overly impressed with the ending either. Such an anti-climax and could have been done much better.Yates' direction seems sloppy and lazy at times, letting the story drift and the characters walk around as if in a trance. Its only the good editing & cinematography that keeps the film on track; coupled with a very good film score by the ever-consistent Lalo Schifrin.Overall then: a decent film hampered by a 10 minute piece of stunt-history.

134,Ziya90,Very slow paced and we have seen much better car chases,6,16 February 2010,"I rented Bullitt with high hopes and Steve McQueen is one of my all time favorite actors, but I was so disappointed. The movie is very slow paced, so I would call the movie rather crime than action or thriller. I waited some action in the first half, waited, waited and waited. I can't say that I got bored exactly, but. In the first half, no action, it is just visually well movie with Steve McQueen. The movie runs by him. In the second half, still things don't get into action, I waited, waited but it never came. And then, the famous car chase takes place, but unfortunately it is pretty short, a few minutes and very unsatisfying, because it is mild like the movie itself, but the editing is really astonishing, cool. Yes, the word cool that many people use for the movie fits the movie very well, this is the word, cool, but no more than that. The movie is visually stylish as said, but it is not enough, because ithe movie is lack of action and it was not boring, but it was not engrossing either. In the second half, besides the car chase, there is one more afoot chase and that's all. Therefore, don't expect something like French Connection. Bullitt is such kind of a movie, it recalls French Connection, but with three differences, it is lack of action, suspense and the story is not engrossing enough. Returning to the car chase, Bullitt's car chase might be in some people's the best car chases list, but if you ask me, we have seen much better car chases and I want to give a few examples, also I am sure that there are more car chases that I can't remember or haven't seen yet. These are my favorite car chases so far: The Terminator 2, The Terminator 3, too much CGI may be, but great. The Matrix Reloaded, again too much CGI and showy, but great. Bourne Supremacy, some people don't like it owing to the shaky camera, but my second favorite of all time. The Peacemaker. And my favorite car chase of all time is Ronin.",Bullitt
135,BillBayard,A classic '70's cop film,8,15 July 2021,"Some older films hold up real well and some don't. This one is somewhere in the middle as its impact in 2021 is not quite what it was in 1968 primarily due to its centerpiece of a highly acclaimed car chase which is still very good, but not the sensation it was then after the many things we have seen since, but at least we know it's all real with no CGI involved. It's also not the only chase in the film. It's still a very good detective story with a charismatic lead performance by Steve McQueen. Robert Vaughn lays it on a bit thick as he seems like slime from the very first moment we see him and that's what he is. Jacqueline Bissett in a early film role is window dressing who not yet learned how to act. I had very fond memories of this, so I regret the negative comments, but it's still a very good cop movie and most definitely and distinctively a superior product of its era. My rating is sort of an average of what I thought in 1968 and what I think now.",Bullitt
136,buzznzipp1995,"Before cell phones, i-pods and mostly plastic over-priced cars and special effects... there was ""BULLITT""",10,12 July 2006,"Far be it for me to say, that not all movies have residual value.The studio exec's had a seven picture deal with McQueen's Seven Arts company, and did not like that Steve stood up for his project and would not lay down. He did not want to 'fake' the city back ground on studio 'back lots' he wanted to stay true to the art, not the convenience and artificiality of typical studio movie-faking techniques. The formed 'formula', that the Indies have been rebelling against for years. McQueen was a true rebel and with a method to his madness, indeed. The studios executives became so 'Upset' at his 'stance' that they came back to him and cut the contract with him, eliminating the remaining six unmade films. What a joke. That fact was the 'joke' was on them, in fairness the movie even after decades is still one of the strongest of action movies with a storyline to follow. No 'B-S' special effects. What you see took real-time work to make it happened. One of the fastest chase scenes ever filmed in a car after using the backdrop of 'Mansell' road in the San Fran area. The reason why the movie feels so good is due to being as close to real as possible. I hate, as I'm sure many discriminating movie lovers do, the executive presto-change-o in the movie script or budget, that is usually done at the last minute of production time, like what was done to Director: Sidney J Furie on ""SUPERMAN IV"" The Quest for Peace (1987) where they slashed his budget to about half of the original arrangement, and then said basically 'Well, what are you looking at? Get going! Bring us back a block-buster.' It's never been truer,what they say, choose your 'battles' wisely. This is how it looks when you have grit and stick to your business with strength, you either get killed, or you become immovable. The studio execs are not gods, of the entertainment world. Although they would like to think they are just that.But indeed, Steve took his 'licks' from the principals of the school of movie-hard-knocks and then got up again and said, I'll still do it in my style. -From what I read and heard about him. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Thank you Mr. McQueen & Mr. Yates for making it Epic. There should be in the modern directorial training classes a of the way this was scripted, set up, lit and shot. Even after 30years plus, this still rocks even new productions and will live on further than many recent and newer films. The real interesting thing for me is that just as this is one of my all time favorite's, this was on the top four all-time favorites for ""Elvis Presley"". Recommended for lovers of awesome action and good stories. This is a winner all the way.(*****)",Bullitt
137,garyldibert,Steve McQueen was Great,10,22 July 2012,"Bullitt was released in theaters on October 17, 1968 throughout the United States. Bullitt is a 1968 American thriller film starring Steve McQueen, Jacqueline Bisset, and Robert Vaughn. It was directed by Peter Yates and distributed by Warner Bros. The story was adapted for the screen by Alan Trustman and Harry Kleiner, based on the novel titled Mute Witness (1963) by Robert L. Fish (aka Robert L. Pike). Lalo Schifrin wrote the original jazz inspired score, arranged for brass and percussion. The film won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (Frank P. Keller) and was nominated for Best Sound. Writers Trustman and Kleiner won a 1969 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Bullitt is probably best remembered for its car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco, regarded as one of the most influential car chase sequences in movie history. The scene had Bullitt in a dark ""Highland Green"" 1968 Ford Mustang GT 390 CID Fastback, chasing two hit men in a ""Jewel Black"" 1968 Dodge Charger R/T 440 Magnum. Robert Duvall has a small part as a cab driver who ferries McQueen around just before the chase scene. In 2007, Bullitt was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". In 2008, Ford produced the Mustang Bullit model for the 40th anniversary of the film. The Bullit nameplate on the steering wheel honored the movie that made the Mustang one of the most popular cars of the 1960s and 1970s. The green color was also brought back for the anniversary edition.Summary: Ambitious politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) is holding a Senate subcommittee hearing in San Francisco on Organized Crime in America. To improve his political standing, Chalmers hopes to bring down Chicago mobster Pete Ross (Vic Tayback) with the aid of key witness Johnny Ross, Pete's brother. Bullitt takes place the weekend before the hearing, from Friday night (during the opening credits) to Sunday night. Following his theft of $2,000,000 in mob money and subsequent escape from Chicago to San Francisco, Johnny (Felice Orlandi) is placed in the San Francisco Police Department's protective custody for the weekend. Chalmers requests Lieutenant Frank Bullitt's (Steve McQueen) unit to guard him. Bullitt, Sergeant Delgetti (Don Gordon) and Detective Carl Stanton (Carl Reindel), give Ross around-the-clock protection at the Hotel Daniels, a cheap flophouse near the Embarcadero Freeway. Late Saturday night, a pair of hit men (Paul Genge and stunt driver Bill Hickman), burst into the room and shoot both Inspector Stanton and Ross, seriously wounding them both. Bullitt wants to investigate who shot the pair and find the Mafia boss who ordered the hit. Upset, Chalmers attempts to shift blame on to Bullitt and the San Francisco Police Department. Ross subsequently dies of his wounds. Bullitt suppresses news of the death, asking Doctor Willard (Georg Stanford Brown) to misplace the chart and have the body placed in the morgue under a John Doe identity. Chalmers arrives at the hospital on Sunday morning and is angered that Ross has disappeared. He is further incensed when he and his police minder Captain Baker (Norman Fell) receive no help from Bullitt. Chalmers places pressure on Bullitt to produce Ross, to no effect. Bullitt reconstructs Ross's movements, finding his way to a hotel where he finds a woman registered under the name Dorothy Simmons (Brandy Carroll). With the hearing the next day, Bullitt suspects the dead mobster may not be who he seems. After picking up his Ford Mustang, Bullitt is tailed by the two hit-men, resulting in a famous car chase that ultimately kills the hit-men.Questions: Why didn't Bullitt like Walter Chambers? Whom was Bullitt trying to protect? Why was Bullitt protecting this person? What did Walter Chambers have to do with the protected person? Who interrogates Bullitt? Why was Bullitt interrogated? Whose identity did Bullitt find out about? Why did Bullitt ask for a copy of a passport? Whose passport was it? Whom did Bullitt follow to the airport? Who was Bullitt girlfriend? My thoughts: Much was made at the time, and over the years since, of Lt. Bullitt's stylish ""casual"" attire of a turtleneck worn with a sport coat, slacks, and suede-like shoes. Since the major portion of the story in the film takes place over a Saturday and Sunday, this was actually in keeping with some police department's traditions of a more relaxed dress code on weekends for plainclothes officers. Bullitt is first seen at work when meeting Chalmers on a Friday morning - wearing a traditionally conservative navy suit under his trench coat, with a white shirt, dark tie and dress shoes. I love this movie! Bullitt could have been another Dirty Harry series if they could have done it. Steve McQueen was great in his character Bullitt. I thought that Jacqueline Bisset was great as Bullitt girlfriend. She also looked great in Bullitt blue dress shirt. I love the car chase scenes through San Francisco. Especially the ones that went down the roads on the hillside, as they would jump from one road to another. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie so I'm giving this movie 10 weasel stars.",Bullitt

139,NewEnglandPat,Possibly Steve McQueen's best picture,8,15 August 2005,"This detective yarn is one of the all-time great films with a great performance by Steve McQueen. The plot has McQueen charged with guarding a witness scheduled to testify against the Mafia. The bad guys need to find and kill the witness before the hearings get underway. McQueen faces interference from a politician who wants to mine the hearings for political gain. The great car chase is a roller-coaster ride on the streets of San Francisco and is the highlight of the film. There are also fine action scenes at an airport that play out at the end of the picture. Robert Vaughn is the politician who puts career upward mobility before ethics and public service. Simon Oakland is McQueen's boss who lets him run the investigation as he sees fit. The supporting cast is good, including Robert Duvall in a brief role. Lalo Schifrin provides a very nice score to a classic thriller.",Bullitt
140,adrian-43767,Bullitt - great flick by all accounts,9,6 August 2017,"Steve McQueen is one of my all-time favorite actors, I rate BULLITT his best movie and performance, so this is one of my all-time favorite flicks.I like the way BULLITT begins rather slowly, picks up with a terrific attack on a star witness in a hotel, slows down again, then turns up the heat with a pacy chase inside a hospital, then quietens again as BULLITT gathers info, then the famous car chase with McQueen behind the wheel of the mean Mustang machine, and the equally famous gas station explosion. And so it carries on, with fluctuations in mood and pace, but all tightly held by highly credible stunts and action, and a superb screenplay (apart from the completely spurious segments with the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset, the inevitable female figure to keep the female gender interested and contributing toward box office).Best of all, Steve McQueen, whose eyes alone carry enough menace to keep the viewer riveted. He speaks seldom and then not very much, but he suffers no fools, is a pro, completely interested in his work, and not above stealing a newspaper. There is clearly a shady side to Frank Bullitt, but it only adds to the character's credibility.Peter Yates' direction is first class. Pity that he may have been forced by the studio to include the completely unnecessary character played by Bisset. Apart from that, the acting, photography, stunts. soundtrack and script all interweave extremely credibly.An example is the confrontation between McQueen and Robert Vaughn, preceded by the misuse of an ambulance, an example of institutional racism in relation to a black doctor, and disrespect for the work of police.The climax at the airport is one of the movie's best sequences, in particular the search for the baddie inside the aircraft. Again, McQueen's eyes alone tell more than any amount of shots or words. He is completely mesmerizing and definitely towers above the film, raising it to heights that I doubt any other actor would have managed. A word of praise for entire supporting cast, all of the highest quality, with particular plaudits for the highly convincing villains.Finally, the ending - McQueen returns home, and settles back to routine, as happens with everybody. I have now watched BULLITT some 10 times, and I have always enjoyed it more than the previous times. Definitely worth 9 stars.",Bullitt

The action sequence chase scenes are stellar and clearly had a direct influence on French Connection.McQueen is great and he has some support in a breathtaking Jacqueline Bisset. Rob Duvall is on the screen for far too short of a time. The script is a little bit film noir like. There is a vague storyline with some twists and turns but not a whole lot of it adds up. This late 60s period (through 70s) is also prone to this type of not-so serious scripts where you often get the feeling the director is just making it up as he goes along. Loose ends accumulate and sit there like the dead bodies which are never fully or properly explained. An annoying politician keeps stubbornly showing up everywhere which seems less and less plausible every time. For this time period the violent scenes are certainly groundbreaking. The action keeps your attention all the way through but for me this film ultimately ends in disappointment. If not for the strength of McQueen's character, the epic chase scene and the ambience of some great San Francisco shots I would give it a lesser score.",Bullitt

I was particularly intrigued by the cars from that era. I always loved old American cars, but somehow I forgot about them. Steve McQueen and Bullitt (1968), I heard those names before mentioned in some newer films, as something classic and legendary. I expect a decent story, great car chases with incredible engine sounds and... plenty of it~! 2 minutes - you cannot ignore the beautiful music of those times. There are also plenty of familiar last names in the opening titles, I can't stop wondering if some of them are the actual parents of the current generation of actors, probably just a coincidence or maybe not 4 minutes - the best part of watching old films like this, is that everything you see is so new, unusual and interesting. It feels like a sci-fi but from the past23 minutes - I freaking love it! 1968 and it doesn't even feel old! 52 minutes - so far no car chases :( 1h 7minutes - San Francisco + 1968 Ford Mustang 390 GT + 1968 Dodge Charger 440 Magnum = Oh Dear Lawd Baby Jesus! Thank You~~! Also, the music stops when the engines revs up... Should I say more about the director? Realistic, would be the best word to describe it. I really hoped for more action, especially the one including the cars... but as I've said, it is realistic film with a nice story behind it. I guess I will have to look for some more American films about cops from 60's/70's, because this one, left me quite hungry for more.tgchan's rating: 7 /10",Bullitt
145,StevenKeys,Bullitt,7,13 July 2021,"Not many scenes glue you to your seat like the riveting race-chase. A staple since the Keystone Cops were on the case, road-rage is the usual format today, but planes (Women-In-The-Wind), trains, boats, chariots, horse-buggies (Friendly-Persuasion), even foot pursuit (FC2) can fuel the fleet.

Think again. Steve was born in Beech Grove, IN and grew up in Slater, MO. Rated by some as film's best race-chase, it's hard to dispute. The San Fran crime story is a knotty one (complicated), but the event, including its build-up (seat-belts etc.), bad-boy shots (Hickman driving, Genge shotgun), cool cars (Mustang GT {McQueen-Ekins} Charger {Hickman}), film (Fraker), frame (Keller), sound and music-lite (Schifrin), all make it a work of art that even a car novice and gun-control advocate can appreciate.

146,blazesnakes9,Bullitt is my favorite Steve McQueen movie,10,30 September 2013,"Many thrillers are routine. Some thrillers are smart. Others are dumb. And, there's Bullitt. Is Bullitt a smart thriller? Yes, indeed. Is it thrilling? Yes, sir. Why does Bullitt worked? Well, to answer that question, maybe movie directors should take notes. Bullitt is an action thriller that stars Steve McQueen. In this film, McQueen plays a San Francisco detective who is assigned to protect a mob witness so that the witness can testified at a trial on Monday morning. The job goes downhill when two armed men bursts into the room and shoots a cop and the mob witness, injuring them. Bullitt is called to the scene of the crime to find out what happen. Soon enough, an councilman, played by Robert Vaughn, (he has been in movies that starred Steve McQueen like The Magnificent Seven and The Towering Inferno.), blames McQueen for the responsibility of watching the witness. McQueen's own police captain advised him to try to find out who's behind the murder. When McQueen witnesses one of the hit men in the hospital, he, then, starts to put the pieces together. But, in the middle of Bullitt, the movie shows a scene that I think, is one of the most thrilling, exciting car chase in movie history. In that particular chase, McQueen chases the bad guys through the hilly streets of San Francisco. The chase runs for 11 minutes and ends with the explosion at a gas station. Now, why does that car chase worked? What made that car chase a landmark? The director of this movie, Peter Yates, creates the realism of the chase, by not adding any special effects,(it's quite obvious that CGI wasn't around in 1968), and put us into the chase as if we're actually seeing this chase being play out. The best thing about Bullitt is that it didn't fall into a routine action movie. Many action movies today consist of big-budgeted special effects and CGI. That doesn't create the realism of movies today. If movie directors want to see an well-played out action movie, they should study Bullitt and see the difference. As for McQueen, he is perfect in the role as Frank Bullitt. The great thing about McQueen in this role is that his body language takes over the acting. In one scene, he inspects the hotel room where the murder takes place. As we watch McQueen, you can tell that he looks around the room and studies very carefully to details of the crime. Like I said before, he doesn't need dialogue to enhance the scene. He fits into this character so well that we see two sides of his character. First, he is a honorable and honest policeman and second, or later on in the film, he changes tone. We realized that he's a different person. He's more cold and indifferent when chasing the killers. That's acting. All in all, Bullitt is a well-made, well-scripted action thriller. Definitely one of my favorites. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Bullitt
147,no-skyline,All Surface No Feeling,7,30 June 2005,"If your viewing this page then you'll probably know that this film is most famous for the legendary San Francisco car chase so I'll start there - yes all you've heard is true it's amazing and oozes class and cool (Steve McQueen did his own driving). The absolute coolest moment in car chase history as the tyres squeal and the car spins out McQueen can be seen almost waving at the camera in acknowledgement. This is up there with the French Connection as greatest car scene ever, so can the rest of the movie live up to this? Well unfortunately the answer is no, it's a very cold and distant police procedural drama with a thin plot. Performances are minimalist at times and I found it difficult to get close to the characters but how you view this will depend on your particular tastes. All in all this film is worth seeing for the car chase alone what you think of the rest is very much to personal taste, in my opinion an interesting but flawed classic with the king of cool and one all time great scene. 6/10",Bullitt
148,pzanardo,The slowest pace in the history of American cinema?,3,16 November 2005,"I wonder if ""Bullitt"" has the slowest pace in the history of American cinema. Of course, ""Bullitt"" is a legendary movie and it was a tremendous hit when released. In my opinion, that was mainly due to Steve McQueen, who right in those years had exploded as a major superstar. I do not deny that the movie was rather innovative for the late 1960s. The cinematography is fine and the locations in the San Francisco area are accurately shot. The whole cast works well, and the stars Steve McQueen and Robert Vaughn give remarkable performances. The story is interesting, although not much exciting.But the pace of the movie is so incredibly slow... All the various scenes and episodes are excruciatingly lengthy, notably those of the surgeries at the hospital. However, the best instance of snail-pace is a scene at the airport in the finale. The airplane arrives at the terminal. The whole maneuver of the aircraft is shown in full details... Then, finally, the passengers slowly start to get off the airplane. Bullitt-McQueen silently stares looking for the bad guy. People slowly get off... Bullitt stares... People get off... Bullitt stares... I say, this single scene lasts longer than the whole Apaches' attack in Ford's ""Stagecoach""! The story is not intricate, but the movie is so slow that one finds it difficult to follow... Bullitt gets off the taxi, taking all the due time; then he calmly walks toward the parking area; he opens the door of a car; after a while, he shuts the door of the car; he broods over something for another long while (there's no hurry!); finally he starts the engine, another long operation... In the meantime, the viewer has forgotten what the heck the guy was doing for the purposes of his investigation. All along the movie, the behavior of the policeman Bullitt is highly unprofessional. But then, to make a number of idiocies just for the sake of disobeying the authorities, that was considered cool in the late 1960s (and also now, at least in the movies). Actually, Bullitt's deeds at the end of the film are not just unprofessional. In the real life, they would cost him several years in jail. And what is the point of beautiful Jacqueline Bisset? Her character seems stuck to the movie, just to show that Bullitt-McQueen is sexually active. Did anyone doubt it? And who cares, anyway?Of course, the film contains the over-celebrated car-chase. Certainly innovative for that time, but ultimately disappointing, in my opinion. I've always thought that the bore of Altman's ""Thieves like us"" couldn't be surpassed. I was wrong. ""Bullitt"" is the most boring action-crime movie I have ever seen.",Bullitt

Grittily realistic with San Francisco making an excellent back drop for one of Steve McQueen's best roles. As detective Frank Bullit, assigned to guard a chief witness in a senate investigation, McQueen is a perfect combination of stoicism and jaded cool. Robert Vaughn makes an excellent corrupt politician attempting to gain publicity with a mob investigation, and Jacquline Bisset is beautiful as McQueen's girlfriend and voice of normalcy. The stylish medium shot direction of Peter Yates ( his best film) makes for a fast past action /suspense/ police thriller. And of course there's the justifiably famous car chase.",Bullitt
151,CatRufus5591,Hasn't aged well...,5,21 May 2021,"...but was it really that great when it was released? Another reviewer on this site called 'Bullitt' ""A dreary bore of an action film"", and I have to agree. I saw this film in 1968 on a double bill with 'Bonnie and Clyde' (terrific
if historically innacurate) and wondered what all the fuss was about. The 'action' in 'Bullitt'
is sparse, the characters not likeable, the ending abrupt and unsatisfying.I know the majority of 'Bullitt' fans will disagree with my opinion, but please watch this movie again and see what I mean. I'm not stepping on 'The King of Cool', Steve McQueen, either. I like Steve McQueen. You
want action? Watch 'The Getaway' instead.",Bullitt
152,SimonHeide,Charisma all the way.,7,27 January 2008,"This is the story of a San Francisco cop who gets the assignment to project a crown-witness against ""the organization"". He has to keep him alive during a weekend but something goes wrong and he gets killed. Frank Bullit is now determined to get to the bottom of the case as he had the responsibility for the man's life. Being responsible for the guy's safety I just couldn't start to comprehend why he wasn't better protected by the police. Just one cop in a hotel room with him. Ridiculous.Steve McQueen, who plays the cop Frank Bullit, greatly underplays his part; he doesn't smile and doesn't get angry but keeps he coolness all the way through the movie. And although Steve is very, very charismatic and very cool with his girlfriend and car it just wasn't enough for me. I was constantly hoping that he would get more emotional (albeit I know he isn't a method actor). In the end he has a confrontation with a senator who has been constantly nagging him all the way through the movie and even here I couldn't really feel Bullit's anger or resentment.Another thing that annoyed me was that his girlfriend (Jacqueline Bisset) seemed immature to the point of being childish. She is very lovely to watch but that summons her part very much up I think.The car chase I actually liked very much. No special effects, just the Dodge Charger and the Mustang GT through the streets of San Francisco. Awesome.All in all there are better cop-movies out there but if you feel nostalgic to the late sixties then you should see it straight away as it also contains some scenes where you get the chance to sense the atmosphere of that time.Regards SimonPs.

153,jckruize,Cooler than cool.,9,31 October 2001,"The script is a trifle murky but it doesn't matter much. McQueen dominates this film and makes it a pleasure to watch again and again, even 30+ years later. British director Peter Yates may not have ever again matched the promise he showed with this, his first American assignment, but what he and his team accomplished is more than enough.This cop thriller is lean, mean and linear. There's no mucking about with a lot of character development -- McQueen's laconic charisma takes care of that. In the course of his career he was renowned for his continual efforts to pare down his acting style even at the expense of dialogue that other actors might horde. Often he'd take his script and delete lines for his character that he felt unnecessary: ""I'll do it with a look,"" he'd tell directors. And he could, and did, and this film is a fine legacy.Other assets: action sequences that really get the adrenaline going, chiefly a superbly-edited car chase that deserves its classic reputation, and a climactic foot chase at the airport that again gets high marks for pacing and realism. William Fraker's exemplary location photography in and around San Francisco probably influenced DIRTY HARRY's being set there a few years later. Great use of ambient sound and Lalo Schifrin's score. Plus an excellent supporting cast: Robert Vaughn perfectly smarmy, Simon Oakland tough and gruff; Jacqueline Bisset babe-alicious.Another example of how low the cop genre has sunk, when you compare the perfection of BULLITT with silliness like the LETHAL WEAPON series.",Bullitt
154,A-Ron-2,"Yes, this is one of the best car chases, but not a lot else",7,19 July 2000,"The car chase through San Francisco is to vie for best car chase with To Live and Die in LA, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The French Connection. However, there really isn't much else going on in this film.  I really like the movie (I gave it a 7), but I am not sure that many new fans will find it all that interesting.  McQueen gives a great, understated performance as the laconic Frank Bullitt, but I am not sure that this archetype really works in the American heroic archetype anymore.  I think it was fantastic, but many others may find the film a bit slow.  And I can understand this, the film slowly builds to a relatively mundane ending that does not seem to tie up any of the loose-ends of the plot or make any attempt to answer the questions raised in the course of the story (why the HECK was that used car salesman posing as a mob-man on the run? Why did he unlock the door?).  But that's fine, I wish the movie had come together more effectively, but it is still a damn fine, if somewhat unsatisfying, movie... well worth watching.",Bullitt
155,Mickey-2,"A real cool cop who gets in hot water constantly, but he just keeps on coming.",9,10 April 1999,"""Bullitt"", released in 1968, and starring Steve McQueen as the title character, represents the essence of the McQueen screen personna.  Steve McQueen always gave the laid-back image a new meaning, and ""Bullitt"" is no exception.McQueen's character is a police detective in San Francisco.  He is given a routine assignment-that of protecting a material witness safe for 48 hours until trial, in which the witness is to give important testimony. However, the safety of the witness is compromised, and Bullitt takes that personally.In trying to get to the answers, Bullitt runs afoul of the subcommittee's head, played by Robert Vaughn. Other members of the cast include Simon Oakland, as Bullitt's police captain, Norman Fell, a detective in Vaughn's pocket, and Jacqueline Bissett as the love interest, and a small role by Robert Duvall.  Each cast member contributes greatly to the pace and flow of the movie; no member was miscast, or out of place.And yes, one cannot review this film without recalling the car chase. McQueen did his own driving in the scene, which featured his car being chased, then chasing, another automobile with bad guys in it, at speeds that reached upwards of 100mph.  The streets of 'Frisco may never have looked wilder.A definite must see-or, better yet,--must buy.  It only gets better with age.",Bullitt

Why does everyone have to stop at a pay phone or ask someone to use their land line phone? How do you get on a plane carrying a gun? Why is organized crime called ""the organization""? Why can't police protect a witness or guard a hospital or airport? Why is the driver of the pursued ""organization"" car so quiet and unexpressive? Is he a former limo driver? Bullit is already famous when the movie starts but it's not clear why. This actually plays out like a sequel to a previous movie which introduced the character in more detail. Still, entertaining to watch and appreciate.",Bullitt
157,MRavenwood,Too Slow for My Tastes,5,19 February 2008,"Basically, this film is a TV show stretched out over a feature length. The set up is perfunctory. The motivations of the characters are vague, which makes it hard to follow and hard to care about. True, Robert Vaughn reveals his political ambitions, but it's not enough information to sink your teeth into motive-wise. All of the women in the film are portrayed as vapid automatons, basically as extras rather than actors, not at all used as real characters. The overall lack of development (of characters and plot)would not be such a great inconvenience to the film if there were more action. The long, ponderous shots fail to advance the story and merely leave you in the presence of the 1-dimensional characters longer than proves useful. Of course there is a classic car chase, which is very good. But the rest of the film lacks energy and credibility.Most enjoyable about the chase is the vintage look of San Francisco. Phillips 66 signs, ads for I.W. Harpet whiskey, blue and red mail boxes, and muscle cars that corner like bowling balls.I guess it's a classic that laid the groundwork for 70's TV, but if you grew up with 70s/80s TV, then it's more-of-same. At least the camera angles work, if not the long, drawn-out atmospheric shots that do nothing more than underscore the era of the film, without advancing the plot.",Bullitt
158,eddiez61,As Dated as a Neru Jacket.,7,7 August 2010,"In the crowded, cliché ridden realm of cop action films, 1968's Bullitt made a stylish statement. Cops can be human, but only so much. It's one of the prices we pay for our brand of freedom. If we want to shield ourselves from life's harsh ugly truths, well then, we have to pay someone else to face them. Bullitt calmly, stoically accepts this role, maybe even relishing it. The man has a job to do, and he's got to do it well.Don't confuse for an instant this tragic new breed of law enforcer with the classic hard bitten, cynical and crass but fast talking dicks of yesteryear. Clever banter is for mere mortals, not super human masters of justice. Dialog is now only a device—a handy tool—to keep the machine moving. His super sexy gal friend is threatened and repulsed by his high tolerance for such grizzly horrors, and probably just as envious of him for it. She feels everything soooo deeply, soooo completely, and her indulgent emotions flow out in pouty, soulful appeals. He, of course, only feels hungry, thirsty, horny, tired, threatened, alive. There's a poetic balance, like all things essential, to their pairing. Together, they form a magnificent whole being; separately, they're less than human. Because we all are so lost in our own overprotected predictable lives, we eagerly seek our truer selves in their struggle, their desire. Failure to do so only leaves us alone with our desperation. You see, these brave tragic characters valiantly do what they do only FOR us, only to save us from ourselves. They are such heroes.Steve McQueen and Jacqueline Bisset are exceptionally good looking, and San Fransisco is so fashionably hip. Cue the car chase—an abstracted translation of the primitive hunt. Fight or flight, kill or be killed. The cars, a dreary colored but ballsy Mustang and a heinously evil black Charger, share costar credits. The other people who fill out the cast are simple, dependable silhouettes of types we've since seen hundreds of times, but here they seem to know they're being played for fools, but enjoying it, in on the joke. Robert Vaughn, in particular is able to brandish his personal charm in the service of a very subtle but palpable psychosis. His ambitious politico projects a foul odor.The lingering effect of all this stylish menace and sublime beauty is classic Hollywood fun. Somehow this movie turns the American Nightmare back on itself, like a re-engineered machine, a reprogrammed robot that destroys all the other evil robots and then itself. It's very satisfying, very comforting to see the shitty parts of ourselves punished. The big problem with this genre is that the idiot masses keep expecting, requesting, demanding more of the same. The exact same. The identical, clone like, unremarkable sameness year after year. Naturally, for millions of reasons, there's always someone willing to oblige the morons and we have now have a culture encased in an impenetrable mass of police action films, TV shows, pulp level books, and high definition video games that has effectively deadened us all to those gruesome realities by which we once were deeply effected. We are all the worse for it, and this condition is just going to get more critical and terminal. Our children's children—if that diminished, handicapped generation can ever bother to comprehend their heritage—will gape at our quaint sensitivities and only sneer at the notion of valuing a life beyond it's expendable entertainment value.

160,joker-scar,BULLIT time...,8,17 September 2018,"I love this film even though it is not a great script. The plot falls down and meanders around a lot of the time. This film is prime for a re-make. I am usually not one to remake a great film but this is not a great film, Steve McQueen is great, the car chase is great, the music is great and seeing San Francisco in the late 60's is great but the story/script can easily be tightened and re-made to a superior story. Having said that, the car chase will never be like it is in this version and also, sadly, sans McQueen. Onward.

164,EyeDunno,A Flick About Realism...,9,15 November 2005,"MINIMAL spoiler for those who haven't yet watched, concerning the ending....Everyone focuses so much on the chase scene, and for those interested in an action movie, they may very well be on point to feel let down by the overall pace and ending of the movie. But I felt that Bullitt was a vehicle to showcase a sense of realism, and not necessarily, action. From the choice to bring actual ER technicians to carry on as though they were actually attempting to save the life of a shooting victim, to the minimal use of music during much of the film (especially the infamous chase scene), I felt that director Peter Yates didn't want to ""wow"" us with special effects and excitement as a way to make us want to become investigators ourselves.Yates simply wanted to showcase the life of an undercover cop who has chosen his job as his first love at the expense of his personal life, and how his choices has brought repercussions to all those associated with his obsessions. The ending, yes, was very anticlimactic; but when does a cop's job ever become a never- ending action flick? Once the case was closed, and the movie ended, I felt as though Frank Bullitt himself were in a prison of his own choosing. Or, maybe, that he simply couldn't ever feel comfortable enough to let go of his job as a way of an excuse not to get too close to the girl that loves him. It works better if you watch Bullitt this way. Yes, it's a great car chase. But one can really empathize with Frank as a man who simply can't let those he wants to love inside his dangerous world. He guts out his job like a terminator, with no feeling, no pity, no remorse, and no fear (loosely quoted from Terminator). And that's his safety net, for allowing emotions inside simply makes him vulnerable, not only to the thugs, but also to emotional pain. Even by keeping his distance from his girlfriend, she still winds up exploding about what he's become, even though he had been a cop long before ever knowing her. And as the movie quietly ends, you have a feeling of emptiness and loneliness, and that's how Frank will continue living.",Bullitt
165,kuciak,"It is Mcqueens performance, not the car chase that this film should be famous for",8,13 February 2008,"When I had first seen Bullit on television, I have to admit, I was not impressed. I had already seen THE FRENCH CONNECTION, many years earlier in the theater, and remembered that famous chase scene. For those who are not aware, the same producer Philp D'Antonii (I don't know if I spelled that right) was behind both films. Perhaps TV did not do the chase justice, but having grown up in the San Francisco Bay Area, the chase was laughable, starts out in the City of San Francisco, and then immediately we find ourselves in what looks like the country side. Also found it funny that he stopped during the chase to make sure a motorcyclist was okay.I do not know why I would see the film again, but the film started to take hold of me, and why? I never really was a big fan of Mcqueen, but I began to find him mesmerizing in this film. It is his ability not in giving out the lines in the film, it is his use of physical acting, that the camera can capture which makes it a great performance, how he movies on screen, and his gestures. He is also not a super hero like our action hero's have to be today. he shows fear in this film, not from the criminals, not while he is in the car chase, but from Chalmers, Robert Vaughns character. When the phone rings, and he feels he needs more time, you feel the tension that is under his skin. He lets us identify with him.If you listen to the Audio Commentary on the recent special edition, Peter Yates comments on Mcqueens physical performance. He, Lee Marvin in POINT BLANK, and Clint Eastwood in DIRTY HARRY, show what an action hero should be, and those three men have set the standard. It is not the beating up of people, or how many people you kill, or the big muscles that you have like in todays movies. It is how one carries one self in those film, even in the quiet moments of a film, you see the action hero that has become so popular today. It is ironic that those three films have locales of San Francisco, though POINT BLANK less so.Robert Vaughn playing against type for the time gives a remarkable performance. Also, this film made before Watergate, I cannot think of another film where a political person, who is out to get the mob is portrayed in such a negative and self serving light this early in film history.I believe that in the mid to late 60's, Mcqueen was perhaps considered the number one box office actor, BULLIT did for Mqueen, what DIRTY HARRY did for CLINT EASTWOOD.",Bullitt

167,jgkelley-48797,McQueen is great,8,24 June 2021,"But doesn't mean ya just act like everything he does is 10/10. This movie was really good but a few things keeps it back from being perfection. A few small tweaks & movie would've been perfection. Literally a subtle tweak here or there. It's tough sometimes with production costs & budgets to go to deep into plots & subplots sometimes & a lot of people never take that into consideration. Sometimes it's sloppy writing, but many times it's just comes down to money. But there's no doubt that with just a few more scenes going a little deeper into the plot literally would have made this film a masterpiece. It's still great on its face though & I don't hand out 8's lightly. That's still a great score imo & the movie is well deserving. Just feel like a few tweaks takes movie to that last top level of greatness. Those tweaks aren't specific either as I feel like a lot of things could've worked. If you haven't seen this movie it's well worth the watch. At least to say you've seen it once. Unless your somebody who hates any movie pre-millennium & need all the special effects of today of course. But idk, I love watching older movies. I feel like the acting comes through better, everything just feels authentic. I'd also watch 'Point Blank' with Lee Marvin, 'Cat Ballou' & both""The Killers"" movie.

The movie got Oscar for editing but it looks unconvincing if you see the movie. McQueen has done the job as per his acting abilities but I think he was a wrong casting of the director. He does not have appealing & macho persona like Paul Newman or Clint Eastwood which is utmost essential in film like this. Few things really noteworthy about the film are its background score- apt to create a mood of the thrilling 70's film.

172,eti55,The King of Cool at his Coolest,8,24 October 2013,"Whether tearing around the streets of San Francisco in that Mustang fastback or dealing with slimy politicians, Bullitt is arguably the coolest character Steve McQueen ever played.A smarmy dirtbag of a politician named Chalmers (played to nasty perfection by Robert Vaughan), calls on Lt. Frank Bullitt and his men to guard a mob witness who has ostensibly run from Chicago and is hiding out in San Francisco, holed up in a hotel near the wharf. During the night, what should be a routine assignment goes horribly wrong, as two hit men get into the room and shotgun both the witness and the officer Bullitt assigned to guard him. The officer, though badly wounded, is out of danger, but the witness is in critical condition and ultimately dies. Fearing that Chalmers will shut down the case, Bullitt, with the help of the doctor, ""loses"" the witness' body, making Chalmers believe he's still alive so Bullitt can find out who killed him. Bullitt's pursuit of the hit men culminates in that legendary car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco. But as Bullitt continues to investigate, he finds out that not everything is as it seems regarding that witness (among other things, said witness unchained the door and let the killers in himself). Bullitt discovers yet another murder, which leads to the other big chase scene (this one on foot), which takes place at SFO.This was the first of the ""loner rogue cop"" movies (a la Dirty Harry) which became the standard during the 70s. But Steve McQueen is much more low key in his performance as Frank Bullitt than Clint Eastwood was as Harry Callahan..there is no ""bravado"" or sarcasm in McQueen's portrayal. McQueen, often underrated as an actor, is at his best here, saying as much with a look as with any of his (very few) lines. Case and point: When Chalmers reads Bullitt the riot act for failing to protect his witness, Bullitt quietly tells him, ""You work your side of the street, and I'll work mine."" It's not the line, which is pretty mundane. What makes it so effective is the look of sheer contempt McQueen gives when he delivers it.Like McQueen, director Peter Yates takes a minimalist approach overall in this movie..even for that famous car chase scene (i.e. once the two vehicles kick it into high gear, the music stops completely..all you hear is the roar of those throaty V8 engines). I will admit that I love a good car chase sequence, and the one in the middle of Bullitt, with two muscle cars flying around those twists and hilly streets in SF at over 100 MPH in places, is still the greatest of them all.The supporting cast is strong as well. In addition to Vaughan, Simon Oakland does his usual solid job as Bullitt's captain, who despite Bullitt's stunts continues to try and support him. Robert Duvall (with hair!) makes the most of his supporting role as a cab driver. And Jacqueline Bissett shows sensitivity as Bullitt's somewhat naive girlfriend, who gets a rude awakening at one of his crime scenes, discovering that there's a side of her boyfriend..the hard boiled detective who seems unfazed by horrific acts of violence..that she doesn't know and maybe doesn't want to. There's one negative: In between action sequences the movie does get a bit slow in places (the scene at SF General Hospital in particular didn't need to be dragged out that long). But Bullitt in many ways was truly groundbreaking, and to this day it's probably McQueen's best work overall. Although McQueen doesn't receive any kind of production credit, from the documentary on Bullitt (which is included with the DVD), you can tell he was heavily involved with the production of the movie from start to finish.",Bullitt
173,Paul-250,A great film,8,30 April 1999,"This is unquestionably McQueen's best role. McQueen asked the English director Peter Yates to direct him in this beautifully paced thriller, and he was not to regret it. It is not just the unforgettable car chase through the streets of San Francisco (one of the two great car-chases in cinema) but the studied control which permeates not only McQueen's performance, but the whole film. A classic!",Bullitt
174,CryptoGuy,Not as great as they would have you believe,5,12 March 2019,"I'm a McQueen fan. There, I said it. He certainly is the King of Cool. But as far as Bullitt is concerned, it's a real sleeper. Aside from the car chase, which is fun, the film offers little. McQueen was famous for wanting as few lines as possible and he got his wish with this one. There's not much of a plot and that would be fine if this was a great character study, but it doesn't even do that. The only thing fast about Bullitt is the car chase. The rest is slow and dull and meaningless. If you really want to get into a great McQueen film, try Papillon, Nevada Smith, or the Cincinnati Kid.",Bullitt

The car chase was outstanding, in it's time, but Steve McQueen and the finely paced action make this a movie to see. My only regret was not seeing more of the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset but that was, relatively speaking, a small disappointment. Highly recommended.",Bullitt
176,mrsastor,THAT is the famous car chase? Are you kidding ??,6,25 April 2006,"Of course I remember this film from its contemporary period, and at that time the car chase was not all that it is made up to be today. Whenever this film is run today on television, the commentators will invariably refer to ""one of the greatest car chases in film history!"" or even ""THE greatest car chase in film history!!"" C'mon. The car chase in ""What's Up Doc?"" is easily superior to the one in ""Bullitt"". The car chase in Bullitt is dull (at least by car chase standards), too short, predictable, and has little to do with the rest of the film.This movie is an entirely adequate cop yarn, enjoyable if rather typical Steve McQueen flick, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours. But if you're expecting the car chase of the century, you will find you have fallen prey to a mere urban legend.",Bullitt

There's little story to speak of - Steve McQueen's detective has to protect a witness and things go wrong - but the style!: the exquisitely long time given for the actors to do things, the refreshing absence of music for the most part, the excellence of the music (Jerry Goldsmith) when it appears, the iconic Steve (icy cool - chasing a hoodlum, he runs for ten minutes in a polo neck, cord jacket and mackintosh and ne'er a bead of sweat), THAT car chase (every bit as good as we remember it) ... and looking back, it was so influential - just about every set-piece has been copied in detective movies ever since. All in all - a gas, man!",Bullitt
178,ga-bsi,Good Steve McQueen flick,7,1 April 2009,"Bullit is a good film, granted not as good as Dirty Harry maybe, but pretty close. The story line is well thought out, developed and executed with many great performances from the main and supporting cast. It has the classic chase scenes of the era, with McQueen burning rubber around every corner and over every incline in San Francisco. The cars ar wonderful, the wardrobes bad and the score extremely sixties with the usual jam session sounding jazz being used in every possible gap. I also have to say that I really didn't expect a lot of the developments in this film and that I was pleasantly surprised in many parts because of the somewhat original plot twists or devices used. I would recommend this movie to all those who are a fan of such action thrillers as Dirty Harry and Point Black, because Steve McQueen delivers that same kind of one minded determination in this film as Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin deliver in their movies.",Bullitt

The DVD has great extras including commentary from McQueen on the commitment to reality. 8/10.",Bullitt
180,Cue-ball,A colossal disaster,1,23 February 2003,"Please be warned that this review reveals critical plot points.  I refuse to call them ""spoilers"" in this context, because potential viewers would be spoiled even worse if they were not warned what a monumental train wreck of a movie Bullitt is before they saw it.I rented Bullitt and saw it from top to bottom for the first time about a week ago.  My God, this is awful dreck.  I wanted to see it to remember the ""great car chase scene"", which is the one reason Bullitt gets a rating of ""1"" rather than negative double digits.  The plot is transparently bad and predictable.  Bullitt is a SF cop who is hand-picked by a Senator Chalmers (a very young, arrogant Robert Vaughan) to protect a witness getting ready to testify in front of Chalmer's committee.  The senator lacks any subtlety in making promises about helping the careers of anyone who does a good job for him, but Bullitt's only interest is doing his job.  Naturally, the witness gets killed while in Bullitt's charge, in a manner making it obvious that someone in the senator's office must have ratted out the witness's location -- obvious to the viewers, but apparently not to the cast. Chalmers points the finger at Bullitt, even though his accusation is incredible.  The rest of the movie consists of Bullitt figuring out what the audience knows before the end of the first reel.This movie wasted a great cast (McQueen, Vaughan, Jacqueline Bisset, great character actors Simon Oakland and Norm Fell, and bit parts in the early careers of Robert Duvall, Barbara Bosson, and Vic Tayback), a great setting, and a good story idea.  The thread of the mob wanting to kill the witness (and why is a witness from Chicago testifying at a state senate hearing? or is it a US Senate hearing, in which case why is it in California?) is intriguing in the introduction, but is abandoned after the opening credits. The dialogue is trite and cliched, but I can't fault the writers; they were just being true to the final, worn-out story line.  Here's a fine example:Senator Chalmers: Frank, we must all compromise. Bullitt:  Bull****.Why doesn't someone pay me money to write lines like that?What of the great car-chase scene?  It reminded me how much people my age craved Cobra Mustangs and Dodge Chargers when the movie came out in the sixties.  But once the ""tricks"" of the scene have played out, it's just as senseless as anything you could find on a Mannix rerun.  If you want a great car chase from this era, check out Popeye Doyle going after the subway in ""The French Connection"".Bottom line: I can't help but think that this movie's reputation has been buoyed by the presence of McQueen and his hot rod.  Pass on this, rent the original ""Thomas Crown Affair"", and watch Steve in a good movie.",Bullitt
181,rabrenner,Bullit Vs. Dirty Harry,8,1 September 2007,"Stylish late Sixties San Francisco cop caper starring the two bluest eyes in the business. (No, I'm not talking about Paul Newman.) The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sensesome MacGuffin about protecting a Mob stoolpigeon so he can testify before a Senate committeebut that's besides the point. It's all about charisma, the way Steve McQueen holds a scene without saying a word. The highlight is a famous car chase through the hills and gulches of Baghdad by the Bay.It's instructive to compare Bullitt to another San Francisco-based policier from the same era: Dirty Harry. Like Steve McQueen, Client Eastwood portrays a rebellious police detective who doesn't play by the rules, has his own personal code of honor, and is in conflict with his superiors and various politicos. Unlike Bullitt, Dirty Harry is all about grit instead of style. One gets the impression that Dirty Harry would kick Bullitt's ass as a matter of principle.Whereas Bullitt's totem is the car, Dirty Harry's is the more direct .45 Magnum. Bullitt has a girlfriend (the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset); Dirty Harry has nobody. Bullitt operates with a team of detectives; Dirty Harry works alone. Bullitt is dealing with some stock Mafiosi (right down to their silk ties) imported from Chicago; Dirty Harry is on the trail of a psychopathic serial killer. Bullitt tools around SF in a sportscar; Dirty Harry spends most of his time on foot. Bullet always appears impeccably dressed; Dirty Harry looks one step up from a homeless person. Bullitt meets an informant outside of a topless bar; Dirty Harry goes inside, and seems accustomed to the sleaze. In one scene, Dirty Harry uses a switchblade taped to his ankle; in Bullitt, it's one of the Mafia hit men, not the detective, who employs a hidden weapon (an ice pick) taped to his ankle.",Bullitt

This is especially true with Bullitt. How anyone can rate this classic less than a 7 amazes me. 1968 was begging for a diversion from assassinations and Vietnam, and the iconic Steve McQueen was just the ticket to provide a great performance. I've read reviews stating, among others, that this movie is ""dated"", or ""it's not what I remember"", or ""boring"". Granted there is no 21st Century technology or Sci-Fi flair.. but then this was the late 60's where the World was just getting fixated with eight-track (that was a source of crude music for you millennials). Bullitt was and always will be a classic of its time. Ford vs Hemi and the latter goes up in flames. We miss you Steve.",Bullitt

Nominated for 2 Oscars, The material was tailor made for Steve McQueen. He is still the absolute definition of cool. Costars include Robert Vaughn and Robert Duvall. Wonderful Lalo Schifrin (Mission Impossible) Jazz soundtrack too. I'm generally not a fan of crime thrillers, but there's more to this flick than the usual police thrillers. That legendary 1967 Ford GT350 Mustang Fastback was as good as I remember it racing through the streets of San Francisco. One of my all time favourite cars. Neat to see the Nehru Jackets, Pan Am, TWA and S&H Green Stamp signage along the way. Much slower pacing and less visually violent than comparable films these days. Recommended.",Bullitt
185,Tulsa90,Entertaining and Interesting Look Back Into The 60's,8,3 July 2002,"I like this movie.  I will admit that it is a little slow and drifting at times, but overall it is an entertaining movie.  The cinematography is very good and it is a good movie for one to absorb the backdrops and scenery, especially all the undeveloped real estate in and around San Francisco, it's certainly not like that anymore.I think the infamous car chase scene is deserved of all the praise because it is realistic, the sound of the old muscle car engines is awesome, and it looks like a car chase between people who are not trained professional drivers.  It makes me laugh when Tom Cruise as an undercover agent in a movie also doubles as a professional motorcycle racer and Indy Car driver in his spare time.  That is utterly ridiculous.  This movie seems to try to keep a good balance of entertainment and realism, and is one of Steve McQueen's finest films.",Bullitt
186,murray_johnc,Bullit set a precedent as a great cop movie; alas the Dirty Harry movies that followed it were dumbed down to a much less intelligent audience.,8,16 November 2018,"If the Steve McQueen movie Bullitt was filmed in and around San Francisco in late April 1968. It is certainly not late fall because we see all those trees with leaves on them. So, how come it is already dark when Bullitt and Delgetti were driving out to the airport to intercept Johnny Ross? He was booked on a 7 PM flight.
Another time anomaly occurred at the Hotel Daniels after the hit men arrived. Stanton calls Bullitt who says: ""Chalmers at 1 -0- clock in the morning? No, don't let them in, I'll be there in 5 minutes"". So how come when Bullitt drives up to the hotel entrance, Delgetti is already there with ambulances and police cars and large a crowd of onlookers? Another time anomaly is when Ross jumps out from his plane seat and makes a break for it. Bullitt is only about 10 feet away from him, so how the heck did Ross manage to get the plane's emergency door open and jump out before Bullitt could catch him?",Bullitt
187,tupungato,Still one of the best police/detective films,8,12 February 2006,"When I first saw ""Bullitt"" soon after its release, I couldn't figure out the plot. Too young at age 12 to know much of anything about organized crime, much less to understand the idea of ""witness"" beyond that of a bystander who observes a crime in progress, I didn't get why Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) kept hounding Bullitt (Steve McQueen). The Ross/Renick issue added to my confusion. When, aboard a jet that was about to depart for Rome, Bullitt made eye contact with the man he was chasing, I asked myself, ""Didn't somebody already shoot that guy in that depressing motel by the freeway?"" I not only had trouble matching the name, Ross or Renick, with the right person, I couldn't decide which one of the two men Chalmers had needed so badly for his own agenda.I also had difficulty with the graphic violence. A shotgun blast to a man's chest and neck, another from a couple of feet to a policeman's upper leg and a kick to his cheek and nose, a look of extreme discomfort on the distorted face of the same officer, who began breathing very rapidly moments before undergoing emergency surgery, left me feeling so stunned that I lost all interest in my buttered popcorn.When I saw ""Bullitt"" years later on video, I brought to the film the tolerance, more sophisticated intelligence, and greater frame of reference of an adult, so I understood the story and enjoyed both Bullitt's suspense-filled pursuit of the killers -- the car chase remains the best of its kind on film -- and the routine-like quality of other police procedures. The coroner's straightforward narration of his observations, the detectives' discovery and documentation of potential evidence in a suitcase, and the arrival of Bullitt's dinner from the hospital cafeteria as he stands guard by the nurse's station all seemed realistic to me.The makers of ""Bullitt"" did a good job, I think, of combining the mundane and unglamorous of police work with the sensational. As a result, Frank Bullitt came across as an extraordinary but not fictional police officer.",Bullitt

When things go wrong - we have a movie.Steve McQueen plays Bullit, a detective with a sense of style worthy of a James Bond. McQueen started acting on TV in the early 50s and by !958 got his own series, ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" His first big movie break came in 1960 when he was one of The Magnificent Seven. A couple of years after that, he played another memorable cog in another hit adventure movie, The Great Escape. Then came a series of good off-beat movies that were so-so hits: Soldier in the Rain (opposite Jackie Gleason), Love With A Proper Stranger (with Natalie Wood), Baby the Rain Must Fall (teamed with Lee Remick in a Henry Foote script), The Cincinnati Kid (heading a stellar cast including Karl Malden, Rip Torn, Tuesday Weld, Ann Margaret and E.G. Robinson) and finally a certified Major Motion Picture - The Sand Pebbles, directed by Robert Wise with a $12 million budget and an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. The next year, 1968, McQueen hit the jackpot with two of his most iconic movies, The Thomas Crown Affair and Bullit.The very name of the movie, Bullit, conjures up a hard-nosed but sleek purveyor of death. McQueen is just as comfortable in the seat of his Ford Mustang 390 GT 2+2 Fastback as he is in the arms of Jacqueline Bisset, Bullit's oh-so-hip girlfriend.

192,louiss,It sure would be great to see a restrained cop film today,10,11 December 1998,I was ten years old when I saw Bullitt from a balcony of an old movie theater. I can still recall how my stomach churned as we all had a front seat view from the inside of 67 mustang that had some serious muscle car mods as it dipped and rose dipped and rose down the steep hills of San Francisco with the most beautiful exhuast roar. This car chase was the centerpiece landmark action scene that changed cop films forever. Bullitt was one of the last taut hard edged cop thriller that was soon replaced with the supercop chase laden heavy body count carnage fests that were soon to come. After 30 years Bullitt still ranks as my favorite cop film alongside Dirty Harry. The car chase still outclasses all that followed as it was a true high speed chase with true muscle cars from the muscle car era even the camera car was a  modified camaro. If you look in the rear view mirror you can see Steve nervously chewing gum in many of the shots. Occasionally the mirror is blacked out when a stunt driver took over. The intensity of Frank Bullitt comes across throughout and his closed dark world is not even permitted to be entered by his love interest Jacqueline Bissett. The main antagonist is not a criminal but an ambitious smooth talking senator who's played with icy cold determination by Robert Vaughn. The story is routine but the tension between Mcqueen & Vaughn carries you along and just when the audience needs a jolt comes the highlight of the film the car chase . It's brilliantly built up with a slow cat & mouse pursuit between the two established killers in the film on Mcqueen's tail when suddenly Mcqueen loses their tail and becomes the cat behind the mouse !? The shot of Mcqueens mustang in the killer's rear view mirror as it appears at the crest of a hill is as thrilling as any in the film. The signal for the real action to begin is when the killers fasten their seatbelts at a stop. The chase that follows includes a spectacular tire burnout by Mcqueen and the roaring resonating rumble of Mcqueens car with the many on board camera shots give a cimema audience the real feel for the chase. The long chase up & down the hills of San Francisco and out on the highway finally concludes with Mcqueen forcing the killers to lose control and plunge into a gas station and of course there is a huge explosion. The film goes back to the mystery drama that it started out to be even without the car chase it would still be a good film but with it and Mcqueen's great screen presence and intensity it has become a classic.,Bullitt

Thoughts: how does that Green Beetle keep up with the Charger and Mustang?Steve pronounces Chicago correctly - chi-Caw-go.

The plot centers around a cop assigned to protect a mob witness that every one seems to want dead. Who do you trust, who can you trust? Although this movie has the greatest car chase scene in history, it is not your standard clichéd cop movie that you have seen so often.

196,adrian290357,Must-see,9,17 May 2008,"Over and above its deserved reputation as a quality action movie, I find Bullitt a fascinating study of the character portrayed by Steve McQueen. The latter is one of my all time favourites and he delivers what surely ranks as the most complete performance of his career. As a principled cop, he will not bend to a San Francisco mayor more intent on his election image than on serving the public. On the other hand, Bullitt has no qualms about taking a newspaper from a stand without paying for it. He is as vicious as any of the ""organization"" baddies hunting him down or fleeing from him; he is a stickler for law and order yet he is not above ordering an ambulance to float about with a dead body so the mayor will not know that his star witness is dead. The film's initial sequence sets the tone, followed by an effectively filmed attack on the star witness; the chase in the streets of San Francisco is justly famous, with a purring V8 Mustang engine, and an abrupt and chancy ending.The final sequence in the airport is top notch even though the main criminal naively takes long distance shots in the dark, making his position known to Bullitt. Some details inevitably date the film while others keep it very modern such as the menace in McQueen's eyes; the way he combs his hair with his hands; and his ""bullshit!"" remark to the mayor.

199,Frequency270,Damion Crowley's Review of Bullitt,7,24 July 2005,"The pace of Bullitt is unlike most modern films, a curious piece of late sixties film-noir, evoking as much from footage and music as it does from dialog. At 113 minutes, the lead character probably has less than twenty minutes of lines, and those subdued and reserved, quiet-spoken; a shocking contrast to the brazen, loud-spoken, quip-uttering characters that have saturated the market since the eighties.The chase scenes, also when viewed with modern work, are much more subdued...and include such obvious gimmicks as speeding up the camera. This movie is much more about the story-telling, and character interaction. The ending takes you to a point and then leaves you out to hang, wondering what is in store for Bullitt not so much as a detective, but as a human.Bullitt is curiously filmed in that you can walk out on portions of it and not miss any plot points, but is filmed well enough to not be boring.Some nice touches are appearances by Robert Duvall and Robert Vaughn (before he became the spokesmen for law firms across the nation). I had mostly seen these actors in their older performances, and seeing them youthful and vibrant and out to prove their chops was a pleasant change of pace.I would definitely recommend renting it before buying it. It is a good movie, but again, I emphasize the pace and characters are different from to what most modern viewers are used, and you should see if that pace is good as a novelty or a permanent investment.

Of course everyone watches it for the great car chase all over San Fransisco and the duel between the 1967 Mustang and the Challenger. I think I'm partial to the Ford but who cares at this point. The plot is kind of weak and McQueen's character of a loner is quite well done. Robert Vaughn and Simon Oakland do a great job as well. There are a number of plot twists and finally the conclusion to the movie leaving the viewer wondering like myself. I have probably watched this movie maybe a couple of times and let my son (Nathan) watch the car chase. He told me he likes Nicolas Cages movie better but what do you expect from an 11 year old watching a sixties movie.

202,Rich359,"Builltt is terrific, good adaption of the book ""Mute Witness.",8,26 July 2016,"Terrific film. What I like about it is that it takes its time telling you the story, and is slow moving, with exception, of course, of the car chase. The film can be confusing, but I feel that was intended. The pace at which the story unfolds is the pace in which Bullitt is thinking to try to capture the killer. I take exception that we don't know why the witness was killed. It is spelled out towards the end. As to the criticisms regarding more info was needed about the hows and whys of the mob, I find that silly. Its the mafia, there was someone stealing from within, and they wanted him rubbed out. Also some critique Jacquline Bisset's dialogue. We need to remember that this film was made in 1969, with a very different collective conscience of peace and non-violence than exists today. The film was reflecting the values of the time with her character, and trying to appeal to a younger audience. That being said, the book the film is based on is quite different. First the action takes place in NYC instead of San Francisco. The character of Bullitt is named ""Clancy"" and he is the typical Irish cop grizzled and jaded with a beat up car. The film transforms him to a hip, cool, tidy detective. The plotline is a little more complicated. Johnny Ross's brother is the one who shoots the look alike fake, Albert Renick, not hitmen. The corrupt brothers cooked up the scheme after meeting Renicks wife, who was a manicurist in a exclusive LA hotel. The manicurist mentioned to Johnny Ross the her husband looked so much like him. The brothers approached Renick's husband and made an offer for him to take the place of Johnny Ross and spring him from the hotel, or the wife would be disfigured. The other Ross would return to LA, and Johnny was going to Europe on a ship with Renicks passport. The finale takes place in a New York dock, and Johnny is arrested, not killed.",Bullitt
203,sudiniup,Where were the writers and logic?,7,30 November 2020,"Yes, a great car chase scene, but the sloppy, illogical police work in keeping a witness safe in the least secure location made no sense. I blame the writers in the late 1960's. Too many movies were made this way, useless, never ending closeups of faces reacting to scenes, other completely useless filler scenes that had nothing to do with the story.
Too many movies were made this way. Lazy, sloppy writing, directors that only seemed interested in making a movie that ran a certain time limit, editors that must have been trying to please actors egos. Who cared if the audience left the theater wondering what the hell they just watched,",Bullitt

There are many reviews on this (great) site, so I'll just include a personal story.....Having grown up in San Francisco, and recognizing the obscure road where the car chase was filmed (we called it the ""secret highway), we went to see Bullitt at the drive in theatre, in a double bill titled ""Bullitt & Bonnie & Clyde"", and nobody had ever even HEARD of Bullitt----which showed first....a pretty good double feature back in the day, on a cold & foggy night in our family's 56 gray & white chevy....",Bullitt

206,wlmlbl,Fast Action Movie!,9,30 August 2002,"This is one of the best action movies that Steve McQueen made. The car chase scene says it all. McQueen really stepped into character in this one. He plays a San Francisco detective assigned to protect a witness in a critical case. The man who gives him the assignment is Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn)..Chalmers is a very political figure, and wants his witness protected at all costs. When the witness is murdered, Bullitt has to cover it up to find the killers. He does, and it generates one of the best car chase scenes ever used in a movie. It is understood that Steve McQueen did some of the stunt driving. I have this movie on DVD, It took me a long time to find it, and I am glad to own it.",Bullitt
207,stephen-scott83,The Timeless Classic,10,23 March 2021,"I'll make my review like the dialogue in Bullitt, brief. Bullitt is one of the greatest movies ever made. Peter Yates masterpiece is a case study of less is more. Frank Bullitt is simply man, a good man. He is intense yet laid back. He is very laconic yet his eyes says so much. He is flawed. He steals a newspaper - he is human. The supporting cast is nothing short of phenomenal. The on location filming sets this movie far above most.

208,Masoo,Which 1968 are we talking about here?,6,19 July 2005,"The car chase scene is fine, but the whole movie is pretty pointless. The plot must have been the boilerplate for subsequent Quinn Martin TV productions in the 70s, and in fact the movie could have been 50 minutes long and been just as good.The best thing about the movie is seeing San Francisco in 1968. The weirdest thing about the movie is that it takes place in San Francisco in 1968, and there is no sense that anything different was happening, in San Francisco or anywhere else in the world, in 1968. Dirty Harry in 1971 was clearly of its time and place, a response to what had happened in 1968 and the rest of the 60s. Bullitt, which takes place in that time and place, could have been filmed ten years earlier or ten years later. There is no larger sense of politics ... the district attorney is ambitious, but that pales against what was actually happening in San Francisco, and Paris, and Chicago, doesn't it? It was only a year after the Summer of Love, but there's not a hippie in sight. If it wasn't for the hills and the landmarks, you'd think the movie was made in Omaha in 1974.",Bullitt

I have read many comments  here about this  film, and some say it is slow, some say it is an action thriller. Thrilling it is! Steve did not have to jabber in every scene to dominate this film.  The car chase is unequaled to this day. How  can anything on the road in later years compare to the ""muscle cars"" of the late 60s? But Steve was the star, make no mistake, and even though the dialogue was minimal, it was enough. Steve McQueen had that power on the screen. He remains one of Hollywood's best, even though he passed away over twenty years ago.  We  will not see the likes of him  for many more years. Women loved  him, men  loved him too. If you have not seen many of his films, watch any you  can. Watch him in Tom Horn (1980), and Papillon (1973). Try  The Getaway (1972), Junior Bonner (1972)and the humorous The Reivers (1969). Of course, The Sand Pebbles (1966) ,  The  Great Escape (1963), and the ever classic  The Magnificent Seven(1960) are among his most popular films.  You never  go wrong with any of these.",Bullitt
212,urick,A foretaste of Dirty Harry,10,5 May 1999,"In ""Bullitt"", the actors are well-chosen, especially Robert (""The man from U.N.C.L.E."") Vaughn as the cynical and rotten politician who wants to corrupt everything like Satan with Faust. Remember the rough anti-corruption dialogues in the airport scene : - Frank Bullitt : ""Look Chalmers, let's understand each other, I don't like you."" - Walter Chalmers : ""Come on now , don't be naive, lieutenant, we both know how careers are made, integrity is something you sell the public."" - Frank Bullitt : ""You sell whatever you want but don't sell it here tonight."" - Walter Chalmers : ""Frank, we must all compromise."" - Frank Bullitt : ""Bulls**t ! Get the hell outta here now !"" - But ""Bullitt"" will be nothing without the William Fraker's sophisticated cinematography and the Lalo Schifrin's tight soundtrack which is his best score. What I like the most in this hard-boiled film is the stylish opening credits with the gangsters; the mood of the restaurant with the jazz band and the look of Mc Queen/Bisset; the violent murder of the fake witness in the cheap hotel; the hospital scene with the killer chase in the basement; the well-known hectic car chase scene in the streets of San Francisco; the airport final scene with the killing of the real witness, re-used for the film ""Heat"" in 1996; the last close-up of the Steve Mc Queen's cool face before the end credits. ""Bullitt"" is for the 60's what ""Dirty Harry"" is for the 70's : an uncompromising individual. What makes this film a great one among the Great ? The character : ""Itself, by itself, solely ONE everlastingly, and single."" - Plato, Sympos",Bullitt
213,DAW-8,Great film,9,1 May 2001,"There were so many great things about this film. You've got to love late 1960s cinematography.  Contrary to being even a ""typical"" cop film of its day, many of the scenes here were shot in such a way as to convey a message to the viewer which goes beyond the plotline itself.  The is an ""urban"" film--numerous scenes reflect the city  and the mood of 1968 by occasionally commenting on racial issues of the day (the black doctor who is asked to be replaced), and conspicuous shots of blacks, other minorities (after Ross is shot at the hotel) and hippies, porn shops on the corner, etc. I found the airport tarmac chase scene even better than the car chase, the dwarfing of the characters and deafening din by the jumbo Pan American 747s completely pulls the viewer in as if he or she is right there. There were some other great scenes which could almost stand alone, such as one in a restaurant where a jazz quartet (with flute-nice 1960s touch) is playing.  It fades into the next scene in which Steve McQueen is laying in bed the next morning, reminiscing about the mood in that restaurant. Many people complain about the slowness of the film, and it is slow, and the use of such ""pointless"" scenes as the one in the restaurant, but I find this is one of the things that makes it so great.  It conveys the complexity and mundaneness of everyday life.  This is a refreshing contrast to hollywood films which are always action-packed and one-dimensional. This film is a pleasure to watch. You come away from it feeling like you have experienced many things, and you're not sure what all they are.",Bullitt

You felt the seat go away from you as you rode with Steve McQueen in that awesome sounding Mustang. The Plymouth don't sound too bad either. Very memorable.When that bad guy puts on his seat belt, You just know Sh** is about to hit the fan. I just love the way the music cuts a way and all you hear for the next few minutes are engines roaring, tires squealing, and metal being customized by close calls that missed. I just saw this again yesterday. The film in DVD with the wide screen ... well worth the rental, IMHO.Ok granted, the blood is a little lame, and the editing could have  been a bit tighter, but that chase scene ... gave me goose bumps all over again.",Bullitt
215,natekowalskitattoo,Bullitt is boring!,4,21 July 2016,"This movie had all the elements involved in any great film, although nothing quite fit properly for the entire run time. It is comparable to a head chef buying all the top ingredients to make an amazing dish, then he calls in sick and someone has to fill in for him who doesn't know how to cook and ruins everything.That is what I thought of through the last half of Bullitt. The acting is great, the cops do not show many emotions but that is fine, that is how a cop should be. The bad guys are mysterious and violent. Tthe female love interest is believable. Tthe story is moving along nicely...then the movie drags out another hour, without anything happening and then without anything resolved...it ends.You do not find out who the bad guys were, you do not know why they were after the key witness, you do not know enough about the main characters love interest or what part she plays in the movie, the Senator character is not really explained. The crime organization is not explained at all. It is perhaps the most open ended movie I have ever seen.No part of the story is resolved or even concludes, and then when the main character finally finds this important key witness character, he shoots him to death and then the credits roll. What the hell happened????",Bullitt
216,monticellomeadow,Time Has Not Been Kind,5,7 December 2016,"I hadn't seen Bullitt in at least 30 years. Looked forward to viewing it again. But I ended up mostly disappointed. Take away the famous car chase - and while ground-breaking in its scope and drama, it had since been surpassed many times - and there's not a lot here. McQueen is okay, but it's not one of his better roles. He's caught in that awkward 60's transition of the cop drama. Too late for straight procedural or even film noir stuff, but too early for the anti-heroes like Eastwood's Dirty Harry. McQueen wears paisley pajamas, for crying out loud! And, dead giveaway, a lot of the men wear hats. Jacqueline Bisset sort of wanders through the movie, to no purpose, complaining about the dead bodies and awful scenes McQueen lived with. Dear, he's a cop! Supposedly McQueen wanted Peter Yates to direct this. Not a good choice. Yates was fairly inexperienced at this type of movie, and it shows. Absent the car chase, this moves very slowly. It could have been a lot better, but it's reflective of its time.",Bullitt

218,pablofuray,Brilliant car chase,8,12 June 2002,"This film for me is famous for the car chase, (probably due to McQueen behind the wheel) I enjoy it, this car chase has been voted by many as the best car chase in film history. I have seen the whole film several times, but enjoy the car chase the most. Steve McQueen drives the green fastback Ford mustang and is chased/followed by the black Dodge charger. The chase starts off simple enough with normal driving through the busyish streets of San Fran, Suddenly bursts into high speed, a pursuit up and down the steep streets and then onto a faster road, where speeds are said to have toped over 110mph. The chase finishes when the charger is pushed off the road and into a petrol station, big explosion. A must see car chase for petrol heads. I feel this film has influenced many films over the years with car chases, like ""Gone in 60 seconds"" and ""The fast and the furious"" etc.",Bullitt
219,StrayButlerReturns,"Not especially exciting, but VERY cool",8,22 January 2010,"Helmed by Peter Yates, 1968's Bullitt is the film which positioned Steve McQueen at the forefront of American movie stars. Bullitt was truly a turning point for McQueen - he had previous starred in several films (The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape stand out the most from this period), but this was the role that propelled him to genuine stardom. With his sex appeal, desire for accurate detail in his movies, and plain old cool, McQueen was a perfect fit for the iconic Frank Bullitt. With that said, it's critical to note that Bullitt is nothing like the slam- bang, action-oriented crime pictures so prevalent in the 21st Century. The film's celebrated car chase is certainly exhilarating, but it lacks the over-the-top excitement of modern action sequences. There are no spectacular shootouts in Bullitt either, and, while the climactic ending brings about a few tense moments, this is not an especially exciting film. It is cool, though, and that's why Bullitt has become a deserved classic.In the story, Frank Bullitt is assigned the task of protecting a witness who's set to testify against the Mob in a few days. He decides to place the witness in a seedy hotel for the night; a location he feels is both secure and well hidden. But in spite of his best precautions, both the witness and Frank's colleague are gunned down by professional hit-men. With the victims near death, Bullitt sets out to track down the thugs responsible; quickly becoming ensnared in an elaborate conspiracy and finding himself in the sights of a vast criminal network.Frank Bullitt is not your standard action movie protagonist. He is not cut from the same cloth as Dirty Harry or John McClane. He's instead soft-spoken and maintains restraint. More importantly, Frank is a loner who is not understood by anybody. His beautiful girlfriend wants to understand and love him, but Frank appears further detached from reality with each case he solves and every ounce of blood he pays witness to (consider a scene in which a corpse is found: Frank himself is calm and casual, but his girlfriend is horrified). While his superiors look upon Frank as a man to count on who'll complete the job, they are unable to understand his methods. He's perceived by those around him as someone who's more machine than man, and who exudes little humanity...just coolness.Contrary to popular belief, Bullitt did not invent the car chase. Car chases have appeared in movies since the silent film era. That said, however, Bullitt did reinvent the car chase. Exceptionally choreographed, skilfully shot and blazingly fast, the chase sequence in this film is truly magnificent, and set the precedent for action movies to follow. Even despite all the sophisticated film-making technology available since 1968, it's almost impossible to beat the mesmerising chase in Bullitt. The entire sequence was done for real, too, with no over-cranked footage (the norm for chases at the time) and with McQueen doing virtually all of his own driving. Best of all, there's no music blasting throughout the sequence; just screeching rubber, the thud of tires against asphalt, and the roar of the spectacular engines.Rather than focusing on action, the runtime of Bullitt is spent examining politics and procedures in police-work required to solve a crime. Realism was paramount in the creation of this movie, and director Peter Yates has pulled off an outstanding job. The atmosphere is heightened by the fact that the whole movie was filmed on location rather than in a studio - hospital scenes were filmed in a hospital, morgue scenes were shot in a morgue, the run-down hotel room was an actual run-down hotel room, and so on. This approach tested the film technology of the era since lighting was difficult in such cramped conditions, but the filmmakers' dedicated exertions afforded a gritty, dark, almost documentary feel. It's also crucial to reiterate that the car chase was staged at actual speeds, and was actually filmed on the streets of San Francisco (roads had to be shut down by the filmmakers). On top of this, actual professionals were employed as extras instead of mere background actors - real doctors and nurses were shown in the background during hospital scenes, for instance, as opposed to a parade of Hollywood hopefuls with a headshot and a smile.Similarly, the brilliantly economical script solidifies the atmosphere of realism. Characters carry out their tasks without contrived explanatory dialogue, and it gives a viewer the sense that they're watching actual events. Clearly, the filmmakers understand the time- honoured adage that a picture says a thousand words, because the body language and movement during periods of silence often convey more than what is spoken. Yet, beyond McQueen's definitive anti-hero and the exhilarating car chase, everything else is somewhat humdrum - Bullitt constantly feels as if it's half-asleep. The plot is perhaps too convoluted and a second viewing is required to get the details straight. Furthermore, while the character of Bullitt is reasonably complex, the characters surrounding him are clichéd. Most of all, the narrative may be a tad too reserved to satisfy every taste. The lack of directorial flourish instils an unfortunate sense of datedness as well.Inevitable flaws aside, Bullitt is a classic cinematic artefact highly deserving of all the accolades and acclaim which has been bestowed upon it. With its meticulous attention to detail and a terrific examination of the happenings behind the scenes of a police investigation, this is a crime-drama that entertains with intelligence. If you don't watch this movie closely, you'll miss vital details, and that's what makes it more than just another cop movie with a car chase.",Bullitt
220,millerman378,British chic with a dose of detached 60's cool...,9,10 April 2008,"Steve McQueen knew something that the rest of his contemporaries didn't. That the world he lived in was changing. Changing in dramatic ways that frightened and confused people without the sophistication or foresight to understand them. Frank Bullitt is a by-product of this societal upheaval, and deals with it by removing himself from any emotional attachment to it. Frank Bullitt is a pragmatist in a world of wide-eyed daydreamers. He does his job, and does it well. He makes no apologies and seems all too aware that despite his integrity and dedication to the ""job"", at the end of the day he's still just punching a clock. Highly recommended.",Bullitt
221,jpd-5,Good Story - Great Car Chase!,10,15 July 2000,"Bullitt (McQueen) is a cop trying to protect an important witness from the mob and other bad guys.  The basic story is worth watching, with enough plot twists to keep the movie interesting.  However, for those of us who remember the pony cars and MoPar Hemi's from the 60(s); the car chase with a realistic sound track make this movie.  So many chase scenes in movies are filmed at 50 mph and then sped up to 120 mph, not so with Bullitt.  The chase sequence shows some true high speed action, complete with smoking tires, high torque V-8 engines, musical exhaust tone and carburetor intake roar.  The cars loose wheel covers (they were probably hub caps in 1968) and bottom out after small jumps.  The chase is very realistic.  I understand Steve McQueen did a lot of the driving himself and I read that he kept the Mustang after completing the movie.  If you enjoy car chases, check out this movie.",Bullitt
222,kwhuneycutt,Snooze Fest '68,6,7 January 2006,"Bullitt is a somewhat stylish vehicle for Steve McQueen about a San Fransciso cop. Unfourtunatley the film is boring. Bullitt will forever be a part of film history for its ground breaking car chase scene. Seven hundred horsepower of classic American muscle roaring down the streets of San Fransciso-INCREDIBLE! Sadly, the car chase scene is one of the few redeeming qualities of the film. In a documentary about the making of Bullit, it was said that McQueen's goal for the film was reality. The film achieved ""reality"" through shooting documentary style and limiting use of Lalo Schifrin's musical score. The result was a long, quiet and boring movie. The film could have used some tighter editing. Most of the film is silent with the characters not really doing anything at all. I can't believe Bullitt won an Oscar for best editing!The limited use of musical score was bothersome also. During crucial climactic scenes (chase scenes)at the end of the film there was no music at all. It was just McQueen running around on a tarmac. The quietness of the film makes it sleep inducing at times. There are a few positives in the film. The opening credit sequence is quite stylish and impressive and holds up very well today. Robert Yates does a solid job at direction and McQueen, Vaughn and Bissett turn in good performances. The famous car chase scene is indeed a classic but the rest of the film is forgettable and quite boring.

Steve Mcqueen plays Frank Bullitt who is a detective protecting a witness for a seedy trial which keeps things on edge and with the like's of some good performance's from Robert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bissett ,Robert Duvall everything looks right. Bullitt did win an Oscar but sadly not for the Car chase action but for best Film Editing which brings me back to the Great Chase, if you have watched it i.e the chase scene as much as me (probably over 500 times and wearing out VHS's and DVD players) you will notice a green VW Beetle Steve passes several times. Now if that films won an Oscar for best Editing (the green VW beetle) surely there's been a mistake just look at the Action or Cinematography which should of won Oscars but only BAFTA's.All in all this films a Classic and will forever be the best Car chase film full stop.

225,DrHypersonic,A Not-to-be Missed Thriller,10,29 May 2005,"Bullitt is an extraordinary film, memorable, powerful, and absolutely riveting. The plot has twists and turns that are believable and lack any pretense of being forced or artificial. Justly heralded for its tremendous car chase--a tribute to legendary driver Bill Hickman, arguably the finest of all motion picture drivers--the film as well captures the feel of gritty detective work in a form that has been copied frequently since, but rarely, if ever, equaled. The film is a delight as a period piece: the easy-going, already laid-back Bay area culture of the late 1960's and early 1970's, the tension between the cool, vaguely anti-establishment Bullitt and the straight-laced local officials and department heads that he finds himself compelled to work with. The other actors are themselves a superb supporting cast: old-timers like Simon Oakland, Norman Fell, an oily (and vaguely Bobby Kennedy-ish) Robert Vaughn, and Don Gordon (as Bullitt's long-suffering but intensely loyal partner). But, as well, there are memorable newcomers: George Sanford Brown as an overworked doctor, Robert Duvall as a sharp taxi driver, and Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt's trophy architect-girlfriend. Lalo Schifrin contributed a superb, memorable score--just the right mix of jazz and brass and percussion. And, of course, that glorious Mustang. . . .!!! Not to be missed!!!!!",Bullitt
226,skyboy1999,The movie that made Steve McQueen a legend...,10,27 December 2002,"All the great movie stars have one thing in common, one picture, that despite the greatness of all the rest, leaves their legacy.  James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, Errol Flynn in Robin Hood, MArlon Brando in On the Waterfront, Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, I can go on... Bullit (1968) is Steve McQueen's legacy.  It is the movie so many people remember him for.  It was as close as he ever came to playing himself.  I believe it is truly one of the greatest on screen performances ever filmed. Any actor with dreams of becoming a movie star should watch McQueen in this picture over and over again.  McQueen plays Bullit, a San Francisco detective who is put in charge of a mob snitch who has agreed to testify against is former bosses, which naturally makes him a target.  Things go askew when two men burst into the hotel room where he is staying, and blow him away. They also kill one of McQueen's men.  Pressure from his captain, and a local political candidate looking to make a name for himself, Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn, who always played a great bad guy) The rest of the film is all McQueen.  He single handedly tracks down the killers, and of course, there is the magnificant car chase (still the best ever filmed by the way) that ends in a chase through the San Francisco airport. One scene always stands out for me.  It's the scene early on, when we see Bullitt eating dinner by himself in his small apartment.  He is a man who is truly alone.  McQueen was always best when he played the loner.  The man who could do anything.  He plays it to perfection here.  He probably only has fifty or so lines in the entire film, but it's more than he needs.  I am still surprised to this day that he did not recieve an oscar nomination for what I believe is his best work...

If you are bringing a top gangster to trial (on a witness plea) why would you only assign one policeman to protect this man from the mafia? (one policeman changing shifts every so hours.) In a crappy hotel. The idea that the witness has let the security chain off is laughable. Do you know how long it takes to kick through a security chain? (about one second). If this witness was so important to a prosecution, surely he would have been placed in police custody? Even with police corruption, surely something secure could have been set up?

Aside from the usual reasons - acting, script, action - this movie is great because it focuses on details almost forensically. One example is the taxiing airplanes, including one whose nose slowly approaches the camera. Another is a lever in the wall on the second floor that Bullitt pulls to unlock the front door of his walkup for a guest. Another is the telephonic device, a telecopier, that transmits a photograph over the phone lines. There are many more. It's like a time capsule of the state of technology in 1968. The camera focuses on each of them, like a tour guide, but without comment. It's for the viewer to observe and digest. And the viewer is invited to be intrigued by each one. It's like each of these details is another hardboiled character to meet as the plot advances. None of this is apparent on the small screen, which is where I've seen this movie before.

It has a great car chase... And the mustang and the Dodge were rivals during the time the movie was made. But the story couldn't get a grip on me.

The car chase in Bullitt is probably, if not the most influential car chase and the one most people aspire to equal. I think McQueen done all the driving himself. Although I have seen the whole film through several times I always enjoy skipping to the car chase, what a great buzz.The rest of the film, for me was very good.Robert Vaughn & Robert Duvall star as well, but as usual McQueen is Mr Cool and steals the show.Car chase gets 10/10 Rest of film - 7/10",Bullitt
233,wootenwriter,"terse, compelling film noir",9,21 March 2016,"Nearly 50 years after release, Bullitt remains the quintessential police drama. Terse and direct, it needs nothing more than story and acting, done remarkably well by an ensemble of outstanding character actors. Police work is depicted as mundane and boring, punctuated with occasional extreme violence, paired with an often opaque rational for the carnage.Through it all, Steve McQueen and the other detectives labor to piece together a plausible narrative for the murder of a mafia defector and the maiming of a fellow cop. Director Peter Yates used no embellishment in this work, which depends almost entirely on the ambiance of The City for the film's momentum. One of the best examples of documentary style film making...",Bullitt
234,jmg38,This One IS the Trendsetter,10,13 March 2004,"This movie started the ball rolling for all future rogue cop movies. Reviewers complaining that ""it's all been done"" need to shake their head - it's all been done AFTER Bullit was released.What is surprising is the way it incorporates many small true-to-life touches throughout the movie that do not normally make it onto the screen. (NOT SPOILERS) The quiet way McQueen keeps eating his sandwich despite a withering glare from Vaughn, the way the son of the police captain interrupts his Dad and Vaughn to say that Mom wants to get into the church, the way Bisset suddenly snaps out in fear and anger just like many people in relationships do.  None of these make or break the movie - nor are they meant to - but their cumulative impact is refreshing.Another (almost) true-to-life touch is the car chase - no dramatic music, no overly suspenseful camera work, just a flat out race between two bellowing muscle cars.  They even left in the mistakes of missed corners and unplanned impacts with parked vehicles.  This wasn't your perfect Hollywood car chase scene, this really was a couple of dumb a**es (the cop and the bad guy) getting caught up in the adrenaline of the moment and thinking that driving too fast would somehow solve their situation.Simply watch this movie, and you will see how good it is.  If, instead, you watch it expecting the biggest most dramatic most earth-shattering breakthrough movie of all time, you immediately destroy the entire concept and only YOU will be responsible for the disappointment.",Bullitt
235,bowtiecinema,This Bullitt is a dud.,1,26 November 2006,"For being such a famous film and an Oscar winner for Best Editing, this film has serious pacing and continuity problems. Bullitt is the film that contains one of the most famous car chase scenes in cinema history. It's obvious that the car chase scene was very revolutionary at the time, but when you consider what's been made since, Bullitt isn't even worth mentioning. However bad some of the editing in this film may be, some of it is still quite good, but in my opinion not continuous enough to be considered Oscar worthy. Bullitt is an action film. Action means fast-paced excitement. Bullitt is boring. The entire film drags along with long pauses in between the dialog and very monotone acting that seems like a bad version of an M. Night Shyamalan film without any of the rewarding moments. The twists in the story are very straight forward, but they are somehow written very confusingly.

But when your ride is a '68 Mustang fastback in fast pursuit of a '68 Dodge Charger, who's complaining?  Sure, Steve McQueen isn't exactly the finest of actors in his role as anti-cop, but abrupt lines like ""You work your side of the street, I'll work mine,"" and the legendary ""Bulls***"" aren't pulled off with Oscar statues, they're pulled off with attitude.  McQueen attitude.  It's a staple of his film career that reaches apex in this movie: Speak to a minimum by only saying what is essential, and maintain a placid expression while doing it.  Why talk anyway when you have a bad-ass car you can be driving instead?",Bullitt
238,themoviecouch,Epic action-noir,9,3 September 2012,"If you want to know why Steve McQueen is STEVE MCQUEEN, this cop thriller is a good place to start. As Detective Frank Bullitt, McQueen is as cool as they come. Men want to be him; women want to have him; and no one wants to get on his bad side.Bullitt is a San Francisco cop who is tasked with protecting a Mob witness so the guy can testify. Despite the protection, Mob hit-men manage to get to the guy. With egg on his face, Bullitt sets out to catch the hit-men. The search culminates in an iconic movie car chase through the hilly streets of San Francisco, with Bullitt in his Ford Mustang pursuing the hit-men in their Dodge Charger. The famous scene is long, heart-pounding, and thrilling, with the cars reportedly topping 100 mph at times. It has become a piece of muscle-car history.The only weak point in the film is Jacqueline Bisset, as Bullitt's wife. If she just walked around wearing nothing but a button- down shirt, it would have been fine, but the problems start when she opens her mouth. Her beauty doesn't compensate for her poor acting, and the film tends to grind to a halt during her scenes. Fortunately, the rest of the film is captivating, an engrossing piece of action-noir. Besides that car chase, there is a great foot chase through the airport tarmac. ""Bullitt"" also works well as a police procedural, as Bullitt methodically retraces his murdered witness's tracks to solve the case.""Bullitt"" tries, in a clumsy way, to get philosophical. The film's noir edge comes from the fact that Bullitt is completely surrounded by evil in various forms. From the Mob hit-men to the low- life witness to a sleazy politician, there is no one to root for but Frank Bullitt. In one scene, Bullitt's wife berates him for becoming as cold and callous as the world in which he works, but the scene is clunky due to Jacqueline Bisset's acting. The theme is better handled obliquely in the rest of the movie, as at the end, when Bullitt washes his face and looks in the mirror, probably wondering if he can ever feel clean again.",Bullitt
239,jackmronner,Upshifting experience,10,3 April 2008,"It only took me about 30 yrs to realize it: after the spin-out to avoid hitting the biker (Bud Ekins, recently deceased, who alos drove the hill-leaping scenes, and also the fence-leaping scene in ""Great Escape"" for McQueen), I always though that there were too many downshifts. They were punctuated by that great ""baw-baw""of the big 390 ci engine. The number of downshifts, the fours speed gearbox and the geometry of the roads did not make sense, until I realized that he was double up shifting as well as doubling down. Appartently, the gearboxes of the day required racing up shifts at the speeds required during the scene. Listen and look next time you view it.",Bullitt
240,hondaboy,"Yeah, I still love it.",7,16 September 1999,"I recently bought this movie and watched it again. Yeah, I still love it. The best part is, it's an action flick that's just about as well-made as any high-quality thriller. McQueen, as usual, plays the calm-cool-collected role down to a tee. For another  example of this, see The Great Escape (also a well-made action movie).But of course, you don't watch this movie merely for the plot and the atmosphere. Any true Bullitt fan watches for the car chase. It is, to put it simply, a cinema landmark. Never mind the fact that McQueen shifts about 47,000 times, or that all seven (!) of the Charger's hubcaps fall off. Oh, I'm exaggerating - It's more like 27,000 times. It's OK: such mistakes are forgivable, given that this is 1968 we're talking about. And you wouldn't think of watching a movie car chase now without expecting to see some airborne wheel trim.The movie is worth buying for that chase alone. The surprise is that the rest of the picture isn't bad either.Other recommendations for good car chases: Ronin (with Robert DeNiro) and The French Connection (with Gene Hackman). And I've also heard they're going to remake the classic Gone In 60 Seconds using Nicolas Cage as the con man. We'll see how that goes.",Bullitt
241,bobbaxter,A High-Octane Plot,9,11 July 2006,"In his earlier tough-guy roles (TV's DEATH VALLEY DAYS and the movies THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and THE GREAT ESCAPE), Steve McQueen created a mystique. In BULLITT, director Peter Yates showed that he knew how to use that mystique. San Francisco police detective Frank Bullitt is the ultimate tough cop. He seems indestructible, and he always gets the job done. He may have to go against authority and break rules, but he always does the right thing. BULLITT sets the tone for later cop thrillers like DIRTY HARRY and THE FRENCH CONNECTION.Bullitt is assigned to protect a Mob informant. When the informant is killed right under his nose, Bullitt is determined to track down and punish the killers and the man who hired them. The plot is a by-the-numbers police procedural, but it takes some very unexpected turns. Naturally, out hero is put in harm's way several times, including one of the greatest car chases ever filmed. Even after forty years of more and more intense action films, the chase scenes and shootouts in BULLITT rank among the best ever filmed.If BULLITT has a flaw, it's the romantic subplot. McQueen's scenes with Jacquelin Bisset interrupt the film's rhythm and contribute nothing to the plot. They are unnecessary baggage.",Bullitt

243,ambrosewriter,Modern,9,31 January 2009,"When I first saw this film, I was expecting one of those stereotypical, neandertholic action movies. At this current time though, I am wrong! This movie was smart and, more importantly, the dialogue seemed like it was actual words that came out of actual people's mouths. The dialogue did not appear to be stilted at all. The entire movie seems completely realistic, with the very noted exception of the now famous car chase. Steve McQueen is razor sharp, as usual, and just as usual, he has a great cast behind him to back him up. The actors/actresses seemed incredibly on the ball, with the exception of Jacqueline Bisset, who seems as if she is intoxicated whenever she's on screen. On a topic that is less discussed, the directing in this movie is incredibly underrated; there is a point in this movie in which McQueen and Bisset are at a diner and have been seated in such a way as to allow for complete fluidity in the switch from one character to another. The themes and characters seem all to modern for 1968, but that is another good part. Great movie and definitely in the ""Classics Canon."" I give in 9/10 points.",Bullitt

It's something to pay particular attention to if you see if for a second or third time. The vivid and ultra-realistic (sometimes almost, but not quite, to the point of stylization) but never superfluous sound allows the long passages without dialogue or music to exist and not seem empty.As with many other aspects of this excellent film, current practitioners could learn more than a few lessons from the sound in ""Bullitt.""",Bullitt

248,todietotruth,Liked and disliked for the wrong reasons,8,3 April 2007,"Bullit is first and foremost a character study about the cop Bullitt. It is not an action movie. The action is incidental.Sure, it was written to be a fun and engaging story that you'd want to sit down and watch. But it's written as a character study, to encourage the viewer to ponder Bullitt's internal conflict. It's a paced and laid back film. It's not quick and thrilling. Bullitt doesn't even pull out his guy until the last few minutes of the film.I'm beginning to think that's why Steve McQueen's films are mis-appreciated so many times. And why so many of them on IMDb have the wrong ratings (usually too low)... Because people are expecting the wrong sort of film when they put on of his in... McQueen, for whatever reason, has this persona of assumed action heroism...Remember, he's called the king of cool, because he's cool. He takes it all in stride, and is laid back... Not because he's always busting out the big moves...McQueen had an actual sense of character development... And attempted to draw the audience into his character... Not just tantalize the audience with action (though McQueen could and did bring it)... See The Sand Pebbles for McQueen's greatest sense of character development.This movie is good for looking at; set in San Francisco. The car chase scene isn't all that flashy by today's standards... But it was very well done. The music is a very tasty, jazzy, pre-70s score... The guitar and flute theme is classic.But by far, the best scene is the intro/credits. The music combined with the presentation of names is so good it can almost set you up for a let down during the rest of the film... But don't let it...The director also understood what I think many people don't quite get. Lack of dialogue and lack of music, creates tension. In modern movies, they fill them with dialogue and music to create the mood... To build ""a sense of tension"", they will tell you. This is not true... Music and dialogue relieve tension... Don't believe me? Watch some Hitchcock... When he's at his best he understands this... The Birds never let you feel settled... Because it had no music... Marnie's safe-cracking seen was nerve wracking, because it had no sound... Even in Psycho, the music accentuated the shock that was at hand... But the tension itself is built by the lack of dialogue and music...Bullitt, as a film, understood this... It lacks music, except in the laid back, low-key parts of the film (to give it a mood)... When the film gets exciting and tense (especially the car chase scene and the airport runway scene), the music drops out... And the dialogue is sparse throughout the whole film...Should be watched and learned from.I give it 8 out of 10...",Bullitt

There is no denying, however, that STEVE McQUEEN is a charismatic actor, and the spectacular car chases have held up well. It's still a wonder to watch these cars speed down San Francisco's streets.

This is a film you should definitely watch if you haven't done so already. It has stood the test of time and is as exciting today as it was back in 1968.

The DIRTY HARRY, DIE HARD, LETHAL WEAPON, and BAD BOYS films have all since taken the concept of the renegade cop to new extremes, and BULLITT looks a little pedestrian in comparison. The famous car chase scene is still impressive just for the fact that, in 1968, putting these stunts on film must have been an enormous challenge.

But after he's killed in his hotel room by the two hitmen (with an allusion to a prearranged homosexual assignation between Chalmers and the disinformed impostor/gigolo gone horribly wrong) he has to try and figure out who set up both Johnny Ross and himself as a proxy for the SFPD with everything pointing to Walter Chalmers having orchestrated the whole affair.In the end, the real Johnny Ross, who tries to make good his getaway by assuming the identity of his dead impostor and flying to Rome out of San Francisco under his impostor's real name, Albert Renick, using his passport and ticket, that is, after strangling the latter's wife booked into a separate hotel on the Peninsula, also dies, killed at the airport in a shootout with Bullitt.Thus, Walter Chalmers, the Mob moneyman who in the end drives off in the back of his limousine reading the pages of the The Wall Street Journal, smugly satisfied at the outcome, gets his cake and eats it too, dispatching Johnny Ross as he intended doing all along, and laying the messy blame for his death that precludes him testifying against the Mob, on the incompetent SF police department, leaving Bullitt to ponder if it's all really worth it when the odds are stacked up against him and he's just a pawn in other's power gamesOh, and there's also a car chase somewhere in between all this that's worth a look, with some Jacquelline Bissett eye candy thrown in, and allusions and side references to the anti-Vietnam movement, to equal rights and Black power, and that the cops are human and on the side of the people.",Bullitt

Steve mcqueen is in my opinion the king of cool and plays the role in the way maybe others would suggest not him but I beg to differ...he's quiet unassuming but ultimately on the ball with his part and onto everything with detail, nothing passes his way or knowledge to get the job done..everyone else in this film from Vaughan, Blissett through to duvall all played their parts with brilliance and I believe the director Peter yates was a brit and his direction is spot on, makes the most of San fran and its beautiful landscape plus a quality soundtrack...abdolutley no hesitation to give this 10/10,brilliant",Bullitt
266,snoreflottado,"The chase, the whole chase & nothing but the chase",8,1 May 2006,"I was lucky enough, at the age of 9, to see this flick at a cinema & the effect from the 'in car' shots while jumping & bottoming out had me a bit queazy. But nothing could've made me leave my seat. Those who saw Bullitt on the big screen would know what I mean - something very special. Those who didn't, bad luck.However, I have a big problem with the sound effects. No-one & I repeat, no-one when trying to drive quickly changes gear & revs the engine once or twice while the clutch is engaged!! It is as stupid as it is futile. But the real curiosity for me is when Bullitt misses the right hander & screeches to a spectacular smoky stop, selects reverse & axle hops with more smoke pouring before getting it right. Why, oh why wasn't the Mustang fitted with a limited slip differential? A much more spectacular exit would've been with both tyres being smoked, leaving 2 black patches as we watch McQueen's car squirm away. As an added bonus, the electrics to the brake lights could've been disconnected so Steve McQueen could apply a little brake to prolong the spectacle.",Bullitt
267,frizb,Magic Bullet or?,9,19 June 2008,"Bullitt might actually be named after William C Bullitt Jr, a scholar and ambassador for President Wilson who was very strongly anti-communist.The connection might be made if you are familiar with Eisenhower's quote about James Forrestal, the Secretary of Defense who committed suicide. Eisenhower's quote is repeated at the beginning of the movie.Eisenhower said that Forrestal was always very strongly against trusting the Soviets and Eisenhower ""I never had cause to doubt the accuracy of his judgments on this point""If you accept this very clear but fairly obscure political reference, then you might also accept some ""grassy knoll"" connections. Bullitt represents the head of Secret Service. The two men in the Dodge Charger resemble Nixon and Eisenhower. The Ross brothers could represent JFK and RFK. The former senator could represent someone in Congress who is anti-communist.The trickiest part of these parallels is the question raised by history about the airplane flight from Dallas to Andrews AFB - How did RFK get on that plane?",Bullitt

The poor (and charming) Jacqueline Bisset is totally underemployed. Shame ! And the whole film drags and drags. Two minutes to see people going from one building entry to a corridor.

270,drexlermcstyles,come on?!,5,23 August 2006,"All I have to comment on is in the first 10 minutes of the film. If Steve McQueen knew the hotel room they were keeping Ross in was vulnerable and unsafe, and he was taking this case as serious as he was expected to (with his great rep.) then why didn't he move Ross to another (safer) room? Then, once Ross is in the hospital, and McQueen knew the killer was there, why was he hanging out 200 yards from Ross's room which was right next to the stairwell? Am I supposed to believe a celebrated and intelligent cop would act in this way? Give me a break. Why do people feel it necessary to defend these absurd plot holes just because they are considered Classics. There must be a little more realism if you expect these films to hold up today, with audiences that may be a little more sophisticated (some of us at least).",Bullitt

Steve McQueen gives his career-best performance, even above The Great Escape and The Thomas Crown Affair (definitely worth a look if you like this), the music (where used) is absolutely superb and in my opinion the film's main attraction is the title sequence, which really is one of the best of all time. There are a few flaws which prevent it from really being one of the best movies ever made, however. The problems are with the dialogue where there are some really bad lines, and the plot, which tails off towards the end.

The chase had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The plot is solid, and the scenes without action are just as exciting as those without. I'm also a big Steve McQueen fan, and I like most of his movies. I've noticed that he is always a hero or important person in every movie(eg the magnificent 7, the Thomas Crowne affair, the Great Escape, Towering Inferno, etc) Is this because of vanity or the fact that his face on a poster would probably sell the movie.

What I like about this movie is the almost docudrama style of the film. People slip and fall and yet the film still keeps rolling, the folks on the street may have been extras but they sure didn't appear to be. And then of course there is the wonderful cast: the amazing Steve McQueen, the handsome and slippery Robert Vaughan, and the underrated Normal Fell. But Steve is in the film so the romantic lead is the ever beautiful Jackie Bisset. The story is a great police mystery and of course the amazing Steve with his custom built, five speed mustang giving the bad guys a real run for their money.

This is emphasized in the last scene when Bullitt is washing his hands is kind of a metaphor for him kind of cleaning up and trying to stop spiraling into violence; anyway, I've rambled too much.The plot goes something like this; Bulllitt is assigned to protect mob wittiness Johnny Ross for 40 hours by big shot politician Walter Chalmers, Ross is killed by two mob hit men and bullitt goes on a vendetta to hunt them down.The greatest scene in the movie is unquestionably the chase through the Streets of San Fransisco and the other place, I didn't breath once during it. the whole time i felt like I was in the car, it was intense.The movie's secret weapon is Lalo Schfirin's music.

A no-nonsense artistically superb film that is a perfect blend of minimalist acting, camera work and soundtrack. The simple spartan dialogue gives the actors the screen space to communicate much more than words. They manage to deliver more realistic characters than the pretentious over-the-top acting we often encounter in our time. McQueen does an incredible job in shaping the personality of his character and discretely exposing his struggles to manage and insulate his two worlds: a rough job that he is good at and a bohemian private life. Eventually, his work drive breaks the insulating barrier... This element of invoking the audience's thoughts has faded from mainstream Hollywood films.

That is what I remember, and of course the never-quite-duplicated car chase (never to be duplicated until there is an actor with McQueen's presence and driving ability...heck the likes of Stallone were better playing a character who didn't drive, who only rode buses!!!) I never miss this movie on AMC and will eventually break down and buy a copy. By the way it was a Dodge, not a Plymouth...a Dodge Charger 440 (a Hemi would have made short work of a 390 iron-block Mustang, even with McQueen driving, although Ford was the king of product placement then I'm sure Steve would have preferred a different vehicle, perhaps an E-type Jaguar...maybe Ford should have bought Jaguar earlier!!!)I've read comments indicating that this movie was the first of its kind, a trend-setter...well, actually I see it as late 40's-early 50's film noir updated to the Panavision-Technicolor era. McQueen, while indubitably McQueen, follows in the footsteps of Glenn Ford (The Big Heat), Robert Mitchum (many roles) and a declining Robert Taylor (the eponymous Rogue Cop).

The race scene, that's what it's all about. When you see the Hit-man in the Black Charger buckle up his seatbelt, make sure you buckle up your seatbelt, your in for one hell of a ride!

291,evangel4,review of movie,7,25 May 2006,"Bullitt is a 1968 action mystery film directed by Peter Yates and staring Steve McQueen. Recognized as a pioneering film in cinema, Bullitt is credited as the one of the first films to ever feature a real high speed car chase. Previous films, although having featured high speed chases, used film techniques to speed up the film.The story was taken from a novel by Robert L. Pike, titled Mute Witness and adapted to screenplay. Most memorable to the movie is the high speed car chase that occurs through downtown San Fransisco. Originally Yates had hoped to film this at least in part on the Goldengate Bridge, however they were unable to due to financial reasons and safety concerns from city officials.The story centers around character Frank Bullitt played by Steve McQueen. McQueen, an expert in motorcycles and cars did most of the high speed film sequences himself. Frank is lieutenant and detective who has been assigned to look after a key witness named Johnny Ross. The character Walter Chalmers, a politician, is played by Robert Vaughn. Chalmers who is often at odds with Bullitt throughout the movie has asked that McQueen look after the witness who is needed for a Senate subcommittee hearing that supposedly has to do with the Mafia in Chicago. Ross apparently stole a large sum of money from the mafia and since then they've been out to kill him.McQueen has a team of officers set up to guard Ross day and night. Despite this, Ross for some reason unlocks the door to the hotel room in which he is being kept. This allows two hit men to come in and shoot Detective Stanton and Ross. Ross' unlocking of the door seems to imply that he had some sort of deal with the mafia, but that they backed out on it.Determined to catch the shooters, McQueen hides the death of Johnny Ross from Chalmers who threatens to pin the blame of the two deaths on him. McQueen then tracks the killers down and after being involved in the high speed car-chase, the two shooters die. McQueen who then begins to investigate another murder recognizes a tie between Ross and this new murder. The person who was supposedly Ross turns out to have been a man named Albert Renick, his wife Dorothy is the victim found in the other hotel room following the shooting. The real Johnny Ross had apparently paid Renick to impersonate him so that he could sneak out of the country on a flight to Rome. All of this McQueen discovers when looking through the luggage of Dorothy Renick.The movie ends with Bullitt delaying Ross' flight to Rome. Getting aboard the plane, Bullitt chases Ross through the plane. Ross exits out of an emergency exit and the chase ensues through the landing field. Ross makes his way back into the airport in hopes of losing Bullitt in the crowd. Ross however is spotted, shots are fired, and Ross is killed.From the perspective of a younger generation the movie was not very entertaining. The plot was slightly difficult to follow and the sound quality of the movie was not superb, which made it difficult to understand what was being said at times. The car chase was definitely the best part of the film, however compared to modern action movies, it was very low tech. By watching the film it is easy to see the progress that has been made in cinematography over the past few decades.I felt the film was lacking in dialogue and dramatic acting, however for its time it was considered to have great acting and a good musical score. The bar scene with the jazz band was perhaps the best sampling of music throughout the film. The best acting that occurred seemed to have been between Jacqueline Bissett and McQueen when she comments that Bullitt is ""living in a sewer"". Overall I couldn't relate to the movie or really into it.",Bullitt
292,sailormercury88,looking for action?,8,30 March 2001,"Bullit has not only one of the best car chases in it, it is loaded with a great plot and cast.

By the time I laboured through this film I quite frankly couldn't care and why should I?  It could have made a good episode of Kojak but a great film?OK, so perhaps the characters seem cliched now because every cop film has one.  Perhaps the tough but fair Captain, the girlfriend who doesn't understand her cop boyfriend etc etc where fairly newish archetypes at the time so I won't dwell.The one ray of sunshine in this film was the character of Walter Chalmers played beautifully by Robert Vaughn, why didn't we get more of him?  I could have happily sat through an entire film based on his character and I know I will watch Bullitt again (with my finger on the fast forward button) to enjoy his role.For my Steve McQueen fix I'd rather watch The Thomas Crown Affair and for my car chase fix this film has nothing on The French Connection.My score is for Robert Vaughn alone.",Bullitt

It seems like a professional killer would make sure the guy was dead by shooting him again in the head.Later the killer gets surprised by a nurse in the hospital stairwell as he is preparing his ice pick weapon and he has to abort the attempt to attack the target again. For goodness sake, the guy is wearing an overcoat - wouldn't a pro have his ice pick ready in the pocket of his coat when he entered the hospital? He would want to avoid revealing the ice pick until he was ready to plunge it into his target.Apparently the hit man does not carry a handgun, only the shotgun.

He gets out on the road winding it out..and you hear him double-clutch and shift AGAIN..into fifth? I always smile when I hear that.

301,ansleydoug,A San Francisco Cop Seeks revenge.,9,1 August 2010,"The movie ""Bullitt"" made an impression that will forever change the perception I have toward watching older films. This action packed thriller portrays a San Francisco cop, Bullitt played by Steve McQueen, who seeks revenge for the murderers of the witness, Jonny Ross, played by Pat Renella, that died in his protection because of sever gunshot wounds. Walter Chalmers, played by Robert Vaughn, a local politician who planned on using Jonny Ross for his own political wellbeing promises to ruin Frank Bullett's career for this allowing this murder to happen. Frank Bullitt lives for his job and refuses to give up until he has captured and murdered those responsible. He later tracks down the hit men and got the revenge he has longed for.Jonny Ross, a member of the mafia in Chicago is brought to San Francisco to get away from the several near fatal attempts many made to take his life. Jonny is a key witness for politician Walter Chalmers therefore he contacts the San Francisco PD to arrange for special protection in the days leading to the trial. San Francisco detective Frank Bullitt is assigned to the responsibility of insuring Jonny Ross is protected. Jonny Ross is put up on the top story of a cheap hotel in San Francisco and Frank Bullitt arranges for Jonny Ross to be guarded twenty four seven. On the first night of Jonny's stay a strange phone call came to the hotel room announcing that Walter Chalmers was in the lobby and wanted to talk. The man watching Jonny Ross at the time, Officer Stanton, felt something was wrong and called his supervisor, Frank Bullitt. Frank Bullitt instructed them to not do a thing and that he would be there in five minutes. Seconds later two hit men kicked the door in and gun shots ripped through the air. Although Stanton, the guard on duty played by Carl Reindel, and Jonny Ross were shot multiple times both survived but were in critical condition. Lighting played an important role in this scene. The lighting was very dark suggesting that something bad was about to happen. You could not see the faces of the hit men only their guns. Later both died and thus begins Frank Bullitt's journey to find everyone responsible for the murders of Jonny Ross and Officer Stanton.One of the more memorable scenes in the movie is when Frank Bullitt detects that he is being followed by the hit men responsible for the murder. Shortly into the scene Frank Bullitt begins following the hit men resulting in a high speed chase involving a 68 Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. This action packed scene used camera angles to make the viewer feel as if they were driving the car. The first person view made me feel like I was driving the Mustang racing around curves, squealing tires, barely missing innocent pedestrians. Eventually Frank Bullitt runs the hit men off the road and they are brutally murdered as their Dodge charger explodes.The movie Speed comes to mind when I think of a movie that relates to Bullitt. Both are action packed thrillers that involve chasing something throughout the movie. Both use action packed scenes and creative camera angles to draw the movie viewer in and keep them on the edge of their seat. As it turned out, Frank Bullitt got his revenge. His mission was complete, his job was salvaged, and reputation was no longer on the line. His determination and dedication to his job and its responsibilities teaches a life lesion of never taking your eye off the prize or giving up hope.",Bullitt
302,JamesH22,"King of Queens,",9,7 December 2011,"Steve McQueen was the king of cool playing Frank Bullitt, the rogue cop that inspired Dirty Harry and just about every other rogue cop character out there.The film follows Lieutenant Frank Bullitt who has been given the assignment of protecting, Johnny Ross, an important witness in a high profile case. But things get complicated when there is a hit and the witness is mortally wounded causing Bullitt to take matters into his own hands and discover the truth behind it all.The story is excellent and you have to pay close attention to figure out exactly what happened. Combined with some topnotch acting and an amazing car chase the whole thing comes together for a dark and suspenseful film that keeps you guessing.",Bullitt
303,mini_beast_ainger,Unique!,10,5 May 2004,"Quite simply this film resembles what most films of the sixties did. Simple, but effective! There are no special effects, no stunt actors, no pyrotechnics. Its simple technology and simple acting and it works brilliantly! McQueen's performance is like any other McQueen performance; Mono-tone but exciting. His failure to over-act his scenes works well and the coolness during the car chase scene is legendary! Bullit may not immediatly grab peoples attention as a thriller but this is because too many people are comparing it with modern day thrillers. Bullit is a quiet thriller. It does not need expensive special effects, explosions and rampant sex scenes to make you pay attention to the plot of the film. McQueens presence draws your attention, and his style of acting makes you pay attention and the Mustang makes it a must see for any throttle head! Anybody who can claim this film to be boring and lackluster should not be allowed to review films. A sixties icon!",Bullitt
304,plymouthone-1,Car chase over rated,7,12 May 2004,"I like the movie. I have watched it several times both cut and uncut versions. The chase is exciting, but lets face it. It was the same scenes shown over and over several times from different angles. They pass a green VW too many times. They pass the same Pontiac too many times. The Charger loses too many hubcaps. The cars are awesome though. Who can't like a Mustang and a Charger R/T? Even if the Charger did have the ugly base hubcaps! I rememer reading a magazine article in I believe Muscle Car Review? in the 1980's about the cars. The Mustang was Steve's personal choice and was modified. Mags, engine etc. The Charger was bone stock bought right off a dealer lot just so there weren't all Fords in the movie. I still have that magazine somewhere, I'll have to dig it up sometime. I do remember it stating the Charger was faster than the Mustang, though the movie makes it look otherwise. I do consider it a good movie overall.",Bullitt
305,tmolto,A real classic,10,7 December 2004,"This movie is just an average, completely ordinary thriller but, including (in my opinion) the best REAL car chase ever filmed.The plot is quite simple and has aged, but it's good enough to keep the interest. The acting is fine, nothing special.The music is quite good, maybe at that time it was even better.Jaqueline Bisset was really beautiful.But the most remarkable part is the chase scene, until then nothing as good as that had been done. The cars are great (mustang vs Charger), the stunts are great considering there was no computer generated effects in there.",Bullitt
306,jd372,Modern directors should take note of the style.,8,21 February 2005,"What a change of pace this movie is as compared with its genre today. I'm no old fogey but would that modern directors become smart enough take several pages from its book.The Bullit character is a precursor of Dirty Harry but a bit more cerebral. Stylistically, the director sets the stage beautifully for McQueen's Bullit. The movie has a European feel (director Peter Yates is a Brit) and achieves its dark mood through quiet understatement. The musical score for instance. Today, music is overly used, overly loud and manipulative. (i.e. in case you are not moved by this scene, here are a division of amplified violins to remind you to weep). In 'Bullit' the music is sparingly used and doesn't intrude at all. It complements the directorial style without setting the agenda.The feeling of reserved naturalism is achieved through editing and dialogue. There really aren't very many lines in the movie and when characters do speak they are very succinct. Notice the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, most of which takes place at the airport. Hardly a line in it. There is none of the chattiness so prevalent today (especially post ""Pulp Fiction"") which is so tedious (unless the script is tip-top, which is rare).Editing is, perhaps, its greatest strong point. The many long edits deserve equal credit with the dialogue in setting the low-key mood. The cinema verite dialogue of the airport scenes (and, say, the scene where McQueen and Don Gordon search the trunk) combined with the long cuts add greatly to understated feel while adding realism.And the performances are top notch. The spare script helps McQueen shine since the taciturn moodiness fits his persona to a tee. There are very fine performances from all of the supporting cast, from Don Gordon to Bisset to Fell to Duvall to Oakland. This is a great movie for watching faces. Note the expressions of the hit men during the chase scene (just another example of this movie letting the little touches speak volumes).The chase scene certainly deserves its billing as one of the best in movie history. Recently, 'The Transporter' was lauded for its opening chase sequence. The one in 'Bullit' is a marvel compared. In 'The Transporter' sequence I'm not sure there is a cut that lasts more than three seconds. In 'Bullit' it is again the editing which sets it apart here. The long edits give you the feel of acceleration and deceleration, of tire smoke and gears, of wind and the roller coaster San Francisco streets. You are given the time to place yourself in the frame. In short, 'Bullit' uses real craftsmanship. Films like 'The Transporter' use hundreds of quick edits to mimic the danger and immediacy of 'Bullit' but it comes across as hot air, confusion instead of clarity. The two scenes are perfect set pieces of easy (and hollow) Mtv-style flash versus real directorial substance.",Bullitt
307,rrebelo,The birth of cool,9,4 April 2005,"Which American movie brings to our memory more the ""Nouvelle Vague"" than ""Bullit""? There was a time when the scenes took all the time they needed, when the characters had time to breathe and when the movies didn't seemed studied thoroughly to sell, just like a deodorant. ""Bullit"" is one of those. McQueen's performance relies heavily in underacting and few actors were as magnetic and great in the choice of looks and tone. Add to it a fantastic jazzy music, that is never where it's not needed and one of the most fantastic car chases in History.Still concerning this very debated scene, enjoy the measure put in the use of special effects, like smoke and noise. This is realism at its most. Enjoy the Mustang's engine roar, revving through the street of Cisco and the noise of the cars crashing in the ground after the bumps. Compare with the scratching, screaming, flaming, smoking chases of modern movies extravaganza. The only liberty put in spectacular effects is the end of the sequence but, even there, is used mostly Bullit's point of view, maximizing dramatic effect instead of senseless show-off.In sum, this movie is an example of how an action movie can also benefit from aesthetic purity (and from the initial credits, you sense taste and sophistication) and of how much the plot gains from dramatic concerns in shooting a film. There are no signs of age in ""Bullit"" in 2005 and many movie directors and producers, if they still believe cinema is an art, could learn a lot with it.",Bullitt
308,TeaVieWatchHer,Lack Of Conversation...,5,13 January 2015,"Having been born in 1967, I was recently inspired to visit movies and TV shows of that era. I clearly remember my dad always taking about Steve McQueen and remember my mom sighing. Lol. If you have nothing better to do, then this movie is your huckleberry. My main pet peeve about this classic is that there is barely any dialog in it. It's the type of movie that has to be watched over and over again to simply understand what's going on. Don't blink, step out of the room or yawn. Even then, I was wondering why no one was conversing with anyone. How in the world did Frank solve this crime? Telepathy anyone? On the plus side, I just finished watching Nip/Tuck with several episodes featuring Jacqueline. It was a treat to see her here in her youth.Yes! Kudos to the chase scene. I'm not a film editor, but come on. Wholly molly man. I suppose I'm not too impressed am I? I even own two Ford Mustangs. Watch this movie if have nothing better to do.",Bullitt
309,pearljammer126,Big deal,3,9 November 2014,"Well this movie does have a great car chase scene. Other than that, not much. Extremely overrated and at times very predictable. Steve McQueen is good, but not great. Robert Vaughn sleepwalks his way throughout the entire picture, he seems more bored than when he was in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.Jacqueline Bissett's character is not even needed, there really is not need for Bullitt to have a love interest, the relationship between the two is skimmed over. It appears the only reason for Bissett being in the film is to show the audience that the King of Cool is living in sin with a beautiful woman...yawn.Skip through and watch the car chase scene, and don't bother watching the rest of the movie.",Bullitt
310,xliipapa6,Bullitt,10,11 May 2005,"Yes I agree. Bullitt is the great movie of it's time. what with the 100Mph chase scene through the rough SF streets, this movie is awesome..right down to the guy with the winchester pump shotgun. The camera angles were great and the plot was well thought out. I liked the fastback mustang that Steve Mcqueen drove and since he was a race car driver, this added that extra authenticity to the movie. The plot will leave you hanging on to your seat and will the great amount of action. The actors, some unknown some not so, all played a part in giving this movie a great feel and enjoyment. I highly recommend this movie for old school movies as well as movie buffs over all.",Bullitt
311,mikecartercorp,"Over-rated, ordinary, and un-memorable.",2,7 July 2018,"You must be either a car enthusiast, or be willing to ignore the numerous errors in this movie, in order to fully enjoy it. The acting itself is quite ordinary, nothing great there. Music is okay, but nothing great. The rambling and unrealistic screenplay is a little confusing and some plot twists are unexplained.
 The over-rated car chase scene is too long and at times boring. It's not only unrealistic, but badly edited. A far better car chase scene can be found in the original French Connection movie. 
 To think that this film won any awards for anything is ridiculous. There are numerous continuity mistakes throughout the film.",Bullitt
312,thisoneaint,Too many unanswered questions,1,29 January 2019,"The chase scene is good. But you never know what the opening scene is about . Smoke grenade? All that briken glass? What was that scene even about? What was all that about? Why would someone be tricked into to go to San Francisco and check into the hotel for no reason? Why would someone stand in for someone else? Who told The killers where he was? Why was he set on unlocking the door?How would Bullitt know what exact cab?in the end i had no idea who was who, or who was even the real criminal. I think everyone was on cocaine back then. Its an awful movie if youre the type to reLly want to understand a movie. If its jyst background noise at a get together, like i said the chase scene is ok",Bullitt
313,judge_dredd-1,Better than 99.99% of 'modern' movies when it comes to realism,10,1 January 2006,"I have seen bits and pieces of this movie over the years and never saw the whole thing until today (Jan 1 2006). What impressed me the most about it was the realism that the movie had. The script was very well put together with no unnecessary talking to fill in the scenes, the editing was kept to a minimum so that scenes had continuity, and the chase scene was by far the best and most realistic I have ever seen on film. Having heard about this scene and seen parts of it previously I found it riveting. This whole scene from start to finish was put together really well. Everything that I would want in a chase was there. The noise of the cars that made you feel that you were actually in the cars, seeing the REAL speed at which these cars are driven, the expressions on the actors faces, and most of all the LENGTH of the scene really made this movie a gem to watch. I have not seen a chase seen as good as this in any movie that I have seen. Where directors resort nowadays to tricks, explosions, tumbling cars, loads of crashes, etc, etc, this scene still surpasses all those other gimmicks. Yet this movie was made 28 years ago. Amazing.And the acting overall is also superb. Minimal dialog so that what IS said is given much more impact than one would get in a film nowadays.Overall the movie is well worth seeing. Much better than the drivel that one gets nowadays.",Bullitt
