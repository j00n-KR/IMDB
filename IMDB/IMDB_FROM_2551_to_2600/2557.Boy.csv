0,SnoopyStyle,unforgettable touching characters,8,31 July 2013,"This movie takes place in a New Zealand poverty-stricken tribal community in 1984. Alamein ""Boy"" lives with his younger siblings and grandmother. His hero is Michael Jackson. He has friends. He has a nemesis. He has a crush. While his grandmother is away for a funeral, his absentee father returns. The father is a druggie ex-con, and a horrible influence on Boy. Boy places his hopes and dreams on running away with his father. The start is brilliantly humorous. The relationship is heart breaking. The father is frustratingly childish. The life that they lead is engrossing. There are a couple of great performances from these unknown actors.",Boy
1,gavin6942,So Much Michael Jackson!,7,27 July 2016,"Set on the east coast of New Zealand in 1984, Boy, an 11-year-old kid and devout Michael Jackson fan, gets a chance to know his father, who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years ago.This is the rise of Taika Waititi in all his glory. Whole ""Eagle vs Shark"" is a fun, offbeat, quirky romance, and is often compared (both favorably and unfavorably) to ""Napoleon Dynamite"", it falls short just a bit. It is with ""Boy"" that we see the greatness Waititi is capable of and would continue with such films as ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"".Exactly how they got away with so much Michael Jackson is beyond me. But I suppose if you don't use the music and just focus on the imagery, you can pass it off as a loving homage or satire. Heck, if I was Jackson, i would have been flattered.",Boy
2,lee_eisenberg,"in 1984, Little Brother was watching you",10,20 January 2021,"New Zealand's Taika Waititi is now a prominent name in cinema thanks to his irreverent ""Jojo Rabbit"". I decided to check out this movie of his from a decade ago. ""Boy"" is just a great movie. The protagonist is a Maori boy in 1984 Waihau Bay. His idols are his absentee father (played by Waititi) and Michael Jackson. Following an unexpected event, Boy has to become the head of the household.The movie reminded me of ""Jojo Rabbit"" in the focus on the boy, with his father gone and how the boy has a surrogate hero (in the latter movie, Hitler is the boy's imaginary friend). Of course, here we have the Maori culture incorporated into the story: the language, the dances, and so on. The movie affirms Waititi as one of our era's greatest directors. I hope that he continues to make these sorts of movies.Tino tirohia tenei kiriata! (I Google-translated that, so I don't know if it's right)",Boy

4,grantss,Simple yet warm and funny movie,8,17 March 2018,"1984. An 11-year old boy, known simply as Boy, lives with his grandmother, brother and four cousins on a farm in rural New Zealand. His mother is dead and his father, Alamein, is in jail. Then Alamein escapes from jail and heads back home, arriving, with two sidekicks, when the grandmother is out for a few days. Boy is grateful for an opportunity to bond with his father, but all Alamein is there for is to find the stolen money he buried...Simple yet warm and funny movie. The second movie directed by Taika Waititi, who went on to direct What We Do In The Shadows, Hunt For The Wilderpeople and Thor: Ragnarok.Starts very well. Very funny in the set-up phase with some interesting characters and relationships and room for great plot and character development. Great scenery and cinematography.The second act continues the good work, initially, and we seem headed for a greatly profound and emotional climax. However, from a point the movie seems to falter, lose direction and drift. It's not dull or unengaging, just directionless and fairly disappointing after the great start.The ending is rather poignant, but still feels incomplete. Overall: very good, largely due to the humour and warmth, but had the potential to be brilliant.One thing: stick around for the end-credits. The Haka version of Michael Jackson's Thriller is brilliant, and funny.",Boy
5,cherold,"funny, thoughtful, touching",8,1 June 2020,"This low-key drama involves a young Michael Jackson fan who lies to goats and idolizes his ex-con dad, who so doesn't deserve it. The title character is, like most children, deeply flawed, but also quite relatable, and the movie is at times painfully real while also dipping into flights of fancy.Recommended.",Boy
6,sol-,Boyhood,6,24 April 2017,"When his father returns from prison, an adolescent has to wrestle with the possibility that his dad is less interested in him and more in a fortune stashed away in this comedy-drama blend from New Zealand. The film gets off to a delightfully quirky start with humorous cutaways as the title character introduces us to his brother with ""special powers"", his pet goat and close friends. There is also a lot to like in the responsibility he takes for his brother and his keen interest in Michael Jackson music with the 1980s setting. The magic is not quite the same though when his father enters the picture. Director Taika Waititi is decent enough as the long-absent patriarch who feels so far removed from his son that he asks the boy to refer to him by a different name. There is also a telling scene in which he tells him ""we are like bros, you and me"", highlighting just how little interest he has in being a father. Solid drama though this provides as the protagonist has to contend with disillusionment, the laughs are not really there and the film never once recaptures its initial zaniness. Of course, this could be argued as a deliberate change of genre to coincide with growing up, but what Waititi does best is quirkiness with some heart and as such this mostly just feels like a stepping stone before 'What We Do in the Shadows' and 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', the latter of which has laughs from start to finish.",Boy
7,briancham1994,Time capsule,7,4 June 2020,"This film is a good time capsule to the life of a young boy in 1980s New Zealand. He feels like a real person and his interactions with all the other characters were comedic, though it becomes more poignant over time.",Boy

9,invisibleunicornninja,Entertaining.,8,28 April 2018,"This is an odd, slice-of-life film that is somehow comedic and depressing at the same time. The child actors are actually really good, and the overall events found here are engaging and well-told. Its really funny. My only complaint is that the ending is a bit anti-climatic. I would highly recommend watching this movie, though its probably not for everyone. There's an end-credits scene in case anyone who hasn't seen it yet is wondering.",Boy
10,p-stepien,Maori Moonwalking,9,11 December 2012,"1984, deep in Maori country life is laden with hardship from youthful ages. Despite cheerful exuberance and tall tales allowing children to walk the moon the surroundings are destitute, unpromising, when stuck amongst the resigned alcoholism and passiveness of adult role models. Boy (James Rolleston), Rocky (Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu) and Dynasty (Moerangi Tihore) are now being brought up by their grandmother, as their mother died during childbirth (to Rocky) and their father Alamein (perfectly portrayed by director / writer Taika Waititi) is doing jail time. Creating fables about his father (ex-war hero, living the high life, and so on) Boy, as the oldest, has been given adult tasks of fending for his younger kin, despite being only 12 years old. Despite having 'potential' he wastes away his time up to mischief with his peers, conveying dream-like stories about his father to his pet goat Leaf, as a getaway from the load of responsibility. The situation changes when Alamein returns to them, not quite a fatherly figure, but nonetheless fulfilling wants of his sons, especially Boy. Strong, masculine, with wicked Michael Jackson moves, Boy becomes enticed with emulating his father. Alamein on the other hand has only returned to town to dig up a stash he buried before being incarcerated, but slowly grows attached to his flesh and blood in ways he doesn't want to admit to himself.Despite the above synopsis ""Boy"" is nowhere as dramatically morose, as the subject matter would suggest. Instead it is layered with wry, at times brilliant, humour, which manages to pack both an emotional and comedic wallop of epic proportions. Fronted by three charismatic performances of the father and his two sons, comes off an instant classic, which despite dealing with issues similar to that of ""Once Were Warriors"" has an entirely different take. Comedy and drama intermingle seamlessly delivering one of the most enjoyable movies in memory, whilst delivering a sombre portrayal of the Maori community, not quite as proud and victorious as some would want. Within the confines of a coming-of-age story lies a heartfelt story with immense impact. The ultimate victor is Taika Waititi, arguably now hot property and one of the most promising actors / directors / screenwriters in the world, who deserves all the praise and the success afforded to him by this movie.And whatever you do don't turn off the movie before the end credits or you miss out on the absolutely epic ""Haka Thriller""!",Boy
11,Kingslaay,A New Zealand Classic,8,26 December 2019,"Boy is simple yet has a powerful message. So many of us grow up idolising our parents for better or worse. Some tend to terrible role models. Boy is a story of a young boy who puts his father on a pedestal despite being a bad influence. His version and reality differ a lot. We see a great realisation at the end where he sees things for what they are and becomes an adult on his own. It also has great doses of humour littered throughout.

12,pyrocitor,Good as,10,9 January 2018,"According to Hollywood, childhood is either a magical, shiny age of oblivious joy and discovery, or full of terrible people and generally sh*t. Thankfully, there's Boy, the brainchild of weirdo genius Taika Waititi, here to wallop us with a knuckle sandwich of truth, then share a melting popsicle with us, staring off at a hazy sunset through a black eye. It's a film ruled by a tyrannical bullsh*t radar, seething with raw emotion but flayed of any obnoxious coddling moralizing or contrivance. It knows that the happiest memories are often witnessed through tears, and that the most profound epiphanies usually come waist-deep in mud and manure... then turn out to be 100% wrong.  It knows that your idols matter, truly matter, even as you watch them disintegrate before your eyes. It's a film that knows that lying can sometimes be okay when the truth sucks too much. It's a film that knows that childhood means riding a dolphin brandishing a machine gun as much as it means having heart-to-hearts with your goat. It's a film with absolutely nothing to prove about people with altogether too much to prove. It's a film that knows that buried treasure really is buried treasure, even if it's something altogether scummier. It's a film that understands exactly how beautiful and lonely New Zealand is. It's a film that knows that the Incredible Hulk is a hero, but that there's a reason people outgrow their childhood heroes. It's a film that knows that a beatdown is really a dance-off. It's a film that understands colour and music in a way that other films only dream they could. It's a film that knows that children can withstand anything, and I mean anything, but that they shouldn't have to. It's a film that understands just how hard it is to miss someone, especially when they're right in front of you. It's a film that knows that not everyone is going to be all right, but some people will be, and that's all right.  It's a film that knows that sometimes you cast that weird kid from the background as your lead, because you just have a good feeling about him, and he turns out to act the pants off all the professionals because he just gets it. It's a film that knows that sometimes you cast the director as the kid's dad, because he's just too adorable and f*cked up not to.  It's a film that gets that sometimes you need to switch to cartoons to show the real truth, because live action film is too old-fashioned to believe in telekinesis. And if you told Boy that it just might be one of the most wildly wonderful films of the past who-knows-how-long, it would probably sucker-punch you, then moonwalk away, flipping you off. But then it would crack a secret, fiercely proud smile when it was sure you weren't looking anymore. Promise you'll never tell. Hee-hoo. -10/10",Boy
13,blott2319-1,Only Taika can do coming-of-age like this,8,7 April 2020,"Boy is Taika Waititi's version of a coming-of-age drama. By that I mean it has a number of the emotional beats that you might find in the story of a young boy learning to be a man, but it is peppered with humor from start to finish. I found this movie absolutely hilarious right from the first scene as Boy described his childhood and his undying love of Michael Jackson. I also loved that this perfectly set this film in a particular time period, the exact era I was growing up as well. I wasn't sure which way the story was going, but I don't particularly care when watching a movie that has me laughing out loud from the first minute. It turns out the film is an exploration of the relationship between a young boy and his estranged father. The father is played hilariously by Taika Waititi himself, and I found everything he did to be humorous (up to a point.) There's something about his line delivery that always strikes me as funny.Despite the goofiness of the characters, and the light-hearted mood of the film, Boy also has some powerful emotional moments. At times, the movie almost seems a bit too light and irreverent to handle the reality of what is happening to Boy. However, I think the tone of the film fits with the way the mind of the protagonist works. He is a fun-loving kid, and he wants to always believe the best of this man that he idolizes. Towards the end of the climax is the most powerful scene because it truly is the moment when Boy becomes a man. That's when I was most emotionally impacted by the film. Coming of age dramas aren't my favorite type of film, so it had an uphill battle to completely win me over. Yet there's some magic in this movie that made it a joy to watch. James Rolleston delivers a great performance as Boy, and makes this a thoroughly endearing film that I would like to rewatch sometime soon.",Boy

15,SameirAli,Beautiful Movie.,8,9 November 2017,"Taika Waititi, I came to know about this name from ""What We Do in the Shadows"". I really liked his film making style and fun in it. I was excited that he is the Director of Thor: Ragnarok. That is his grown in film making. I got the chance to watch his movie ""Boy"" in theater.The film starts with an innocent narration of the protagonist boy called as Boy. From this narration, you will be determined to watch the full movie. It was no innocent and funny. Whatever the nation is, you can get the glimpses of your childhood from Boy. Great visuals and wonderful treatment makes it a movie worth watch.James Rolleston was really lucky to get the lead role. He nailed it. In fact, he was cast as an extra. But, as the lead cast did not perform well, he won the part.Do not miss this movie. It's really good. #KiduMovie",Boy
16,ThurstonHunger,Precocious Powers,7,26 November 2020,"Another solid outing from Taika. Watched it with my 18 year kids, and for them I think some of the heaviness of the film weighed it down as it made its way to the conclusion. Still there's plenty of silliness, and even serious silliness to be had along the way.I enjoyed it more than the lads, but sure there's some bittersweet which suits my palate better. ""Boy"" doesn't find its footing as well as the ""Wilderpeople"" which is a must-watch by all of our family sub-standards. That film gets its pain out of the way earlier, and the risks become more or less laughable, in ""Boy"" the risks start to stack up and cannot chuckled or Hakka'd away.One question I had afterwards : Is there a precariousness of precociousness? Watiti surely loves the wisdom of youth, especially outcast youth. In this film it feels like the Dad (really an overgrown child) is overshadowed by Boy, and to me Boy in turn was overshadowed by Rocky.Maybe Watiti is just fed up with adults, unless they are the undead? Curious to see a film from him without kids.... It was also interesting to see the accompanying black and white short (""two cars, one night"" I think it was called) that had precocious kids but also all kinds of film school moves to it.",Boy

18,diane-34,A rare thing; an excellent slice of life movie.,10,17 October 2010,"D and I saw this beautiful and rare film yesterday in Fremantle and both of us enjoyed it tremendously. It was a breath of fresh air; a film that lets the viewer look into the lives of people, the New Zealand Maoris, who virtually never have the chance to show what their world is about. Here comes the huge generalization that school teachers try, sometimes successfully, to weed out of their students: the Maoris are the indigenous people of New Zealand and (generalization) like all colonized people around the world they have suffered terribly at the hands of their colonizers, the Anglo Europeans. The ""Boy"" does not spare the viewer when confronting these impacts but they are not thrown at the viewer like a massive head-butt; they are only shown as the common factors of a life being led. As opposed to the movie's commentators, I was particularly attracted to the father played by Tanka Waititi; the boy of the story, his son, was virtually a canvas upon which Waititi painted his strange attempt at reality. I know, I know film students will say it has all been done before, his character is a cutout etc., etc. I've read it many times before but the fact remains that he and his gang (of three) are funny and his exploits (used in the broadest sense of the word) are funny. I found the entire film very sad but the fact that it was made by Maori people, exposing their lives made for a fascinating peek into a society unexamined by most of us Anglos.",Boy

20,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,"""Don't be so weird, egg!""",9,2 January 2017,"Taika Waititi's breakout film from 2010 isn't as straight-up entertaining as this year's Hunt for the Wilderpeople; it's rougher and much more personal. And, IMHO, it's right up there with such classic boy's-eye-view accounts of life's turning points as My Life as a Dog, Léolo, My Life So Far and, of course, Boyhood. The script's a little patchy at times (maybe because the film was upsized from a short to feature length), but TW seems to be one of those people, like Fellini and Charles Schulz, who remember every moment of their childhood, and it all seems very real. The title character and sometime narrator (great job by last-minute recruit James Rolleston) idolizes his absentee, inmate dad as an unstoppable action hero; when Dad unexpectedly turns up to retrieve a bag of stolen cash from a long-ago botched robbery, the idol's feet of clay (and head full of pot smoke) are very much in evidence. TW avoids coming-of-age clichés—the distinctive locale, a coastal Maori reserve back in '84, certainly helps with that—and his quick, sardonic visual style really keeps things moving.He tips us off in two short scenes, for example, that Boy's already set foot on the same path as his childlike, braggadocious dad: Boy shows off his dorky ""Thriller""- style dance moves, and later Dad shouts out ""Dukes of Hazzard!"" and slithers awkwardly through the driver-side window of his car, in front of the same audience of bemused little kids and disdainful mean girls Boy's 6-year-old brother, Ricky, provides his own mystical perspective, and there are lots of low-tech visual delights, notably Ricky's animated crayon drawings and the cast's lively haka à la Michael Jackson right before the closing credits.",Boy
21,Donatien3,Funny and Heartfelt,9,16 March 2019,"His second film after ""Eagle v Shark"", ""Boy"" follows Taika Waititi's now-proven funny-and-heartfelt formula.Set in 1980s New Zealand, James Rolleston plays Boy, an 11-year-old who has potential, a big imagination and a love of Michael Jackson.Boy's world - where he's the unofficial carer for his big family aside from his grandmother (his mother died giving birth to his younger brother) - is shaken when his absentee father (Waititi) arrives. While they bond initially, the relationship sours when Boy learns of his dad's criminal and gang-related activities.Like all Waititi movies, ""Boy"" is driven by understated New Zealand humour and beautiful scenery. This is accentuated by some cool hand-drawn animation and Jackson-inspired dance scenes.Highly recommended.",Boy
22,Chris_Pandolfi,He Has Potential,8,3 March 2012,"The key word in ""Boy"" is ""potential."" It's repeatedly spoken aloud by the title character (James Rolleston), an eleven-year-old Maori living in Waihau Bay, New Zealand in 1984. Initially, he has no idea what it means. All the same, he thinks he has plenty of it. From our perspective, his circumstances suggest otherwise; he lives a meager existence on a farm with his grandmother, Nan (Mavis Paenga), his kid brother, Rocky (Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu), a pet goat named Leaf, and several cousins. All he really has going for him is his love of Michael Jackson and memories of his father. Even then, they aren't real memories. They're merely tall tales Boy has invented as a coping mechanism for his absence. In reality, his father has been out of the picture for several years, having been sent to prison for robbing the local gas station.When Nan goes off to Wellington to attend a funeral, Boy is left in charge. This would be right around the start of the summer holiday, at which point he first hears one of his teachers use the word ""potential"" and becomes fixated on it. Not long after, three men drive up to Boy's home. One of them is his long-lost father, Alamein (Taika Waititi, also the film's writer and director). Boy is immediately taken by him. He has a cool black car. He has started his own gang called The Crazy Horses. True, it currently only has three members, but at least Alamein gets to wear a badass leather jacket with the logo on the back. He likes Michael Jackson too, but he's an even bigger fan of Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"" and he will spend a great deal of time professing his admiration for E.T.'s magic healing touch.At this point, Boy has looked up the word ""potential"" in the dictionary. All the fancy words used in the definition confuse him, and yet he seems to get the general idea. With his father back in his life, he believes he has finally found his potential: To be exactly like him. Alamein eventually says that he doesn't wish to be addressed as Dad but as Shogun, like a Japanese warrior. In response, Boy wishes to be addressed as Little Shogun. The two will for a time come together as they dig holes in a nearby field looking for what Alamein calls buried treasure. We already know that, in reality, Alamein and his men are looking for the spot in which they buried the money they stole from the gas station. His problem is that he can't remember how many paces he went into the field, nor the fencepost from which he started.What kind of potential does Alamein have? The audience is not made to see him in the same way as Boy – an aggrandized figure at the center of several amateur reenactments of Michael Jackson music videos. Instead, he's made to be seen as an opportunist, a buffoon, a manipulator, a marijuana smoker, a hard drinker, and generally someone who is dangerous and unreliable. Boy will eventually pick up on this, forcing him to reassess his own potential. No matter what part of the world you're from, this is called growing up. Simultaneously, he will go through all the typical adolescent trials and tribulations, including trying to impress the girl of his dreams (RickyLee Waipuka-Russell), inflating his reputation by passing off the vacuum hose mark on his chest as a hickey, and avoiding the local bully and his big brother. Alamein will occasionally offer advice in these areas, even though he has no idea what he's doing or saying.Meanwhile, Rocky is the subject of an absorbing yet oddly disconnected subplot in which he befriends a local drifter Boy has dubbed Weirdo (Waihoroi Shortland), who spends all his time crouched over as he looks for things in the dirt. We don't know if he's homeless, mentally challenged, both, or neither. All we do know is that he's the only person willing to indulge Rocky in his belief that he possesses super powers – the ones bestowed by his mother as she died giving birth to him. There's a touching moment when he approaches his father, puts his fingers on his forehead, and apologizes for killing his mother. It's unclear whether or not Alamein blames Rocky for her death, as he never treats Rocky any better or worse than Boy.Rocky is a source of frustration for Boy, although there seems to be no reason for it apart from the convention that older brothers automatically hate their younger brothers. Perhaps it's the fact that Rocky sees the world differently, namely as animated childhood doodles on sheets of college-ruled paper. Indeed, he spends a lot of time drawing pictures, mostly as his mother's gravesite. Does the word ""potential"" apply to him too? Surely it must apply to everyone. The message of ""Boy,"" I believe, is that we each possess positive and negative attributes, and that the key to a successful life is finding the right balance. The film isn't so conventional as to show this happening with any of the characters; we merely see the process of living from day to day and taking things as they come. As they say, it's not the destination that's important, but the journey.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Boy
23,gregking4,a painfully personal film that deftly mixes black humour and sadness,7,15 July 2010,"""You could be happy here. We could grow up together."" This epigraph from ET at the start of this quirky New Zealand comedy serves as a perfect introduction to the themes and central plot of Boy.Writer/director and former stand-up comedian Taika Waititi (Eagle Vs Shark, The Flight Of The Conchords, etc) has drawn upon his own experiences growing up in new Zealand in the 1980's to shape this poignant and quirky coming of age tale. Boy deals with themes of family, fatherhood, responsibility, the innocence and imagination of childhood that is lost when one grows up, hero worship, and the heartbreaking loss of innocence. Waititi further develops themes and ideas from his Oscar nominated short film Two Cars, One Night, and suffuses the material with subtle black humour, quirky touches and plenty of his trade mark deadpan humour.New comer James Rolleston makes his film debut, and has an appealing and natural presence as the 11-year-old title character. Since the death of his mother, Boy and his family live in the care of their elderly grandmother. But when she travels to Wellington for a few days to attend a funeral, Boy is left in charge of his siblings. When we first meet Boy he is fantasizing about his absentee father, whom he envisages in a variety of heroic roles. But the reality is vastly different. Alamein (played by Waititi himself) has been released from jail, and returns home to the small dead end town of Waihau Bay. Dad turns out to be a drug addled loser, a petty crook who has come home, not to spend time with his children but to try and dig up some money he buried a couple of year earlier. Unfortunately he can't remember where he buried it, and is forced to hang around for a few days. Boy tries to bond with his father, but in the end he realizes that Alamein is a failure as a parent, a father, a man, and a role model.Boy is a painfully personal film that deftly mixes black humour and sadness. The film is set in 1984, and Waititi also imbues the film with a strong sense of place and time, particularly through Boy's obsession with Michael Jackson. Boy has becomes one of the most successful films released in New Zealand, and its universal themes and quirky humour suggests that it could also have broad appeal in other territories.",Boy

Many an African American will also find a lot in common with the heroes of this movie, as theme of absent fathers are as proverbial as occasional sip of Kool Aid or a nice slice of juicy watermelon. Our Boy (pardon the pun) shows some potential. The best part of the movie comes after the ending, when Taika turns Thriller homage into a Maori dance. The movie is quite depressing, and director has not yet fully matured at the time of making this movie, as movie is occasionally painful to watch, yet some of his soulful idiosyncrasies are already present, and the movie speaks volumes about where Taiki really comes from.

The movie is packed to the brim with 80's pop culture references romanticizing everything from E.T. to Thriller.

28,selffamily,It's the afterglow that counts,9,4 June 2010,"I had been told how funny this movie was, and there are quite a few chuckles in the first 20 minutes or so, and then it buckles down to show us the real story of pre-pubescence in a rural community and the father-son thing. It was explored in depth and very well too, and never gets nasty as some NZ movies can do, but still wrings your heart out. The end-piece was stunning, utilising the obsession with a teenage Michael Jackson and humour as only the NZ Maori do. I left the theatre with mixed feelings but since then I have felt buoyed up (sorry) and am remembering it fondly. Will definitely see it again and may add it to my small collection of NZ films. Others have mentioned Eagle and Shark and Secondhand Wedding, but this is more historical and captures the era perfectly. Well done all - especially to all the actors under 20, we know the adults can act, but these fellas will be worth watching out for in the future.",Boy
29,annuskavdpol,A boy in a man's skin.,5,20 December 2013,"I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 because I found the movie to be more disturbing then beautiful, and I often look for beauty in the world. This movie is about a family that has no mother and a father who is a criminal. The small children take care of themselves. Within the story, there are elements of hope which push the story forward. One main magical moment was when the boy is on the bridge. What happens next is sad, but the end result is a miracle, which ties in with Christmas. So in essence this is a good movie to watch in December (I watched it in Dec. 2013) because of the miracle that happens to boy after he is on the bridge. What I did not like was the dysfunction of the family. It seemed the children were running the household, like in Lord of the Flies. The end was a virtual dystopia. It is pretty sad to think of what may become of the children in this family. Will they be able to break the chain of dysfunction or will it continue, and will they be victims of circumstance?",Boy

It's fun and has enough humor in it. I know I don't see you too much in my reviews because I don't like to know anything about a movie I'm going to see. It's a coming-of-age film. In particular about what we fantasize and what we find out. I also liked seeing New Zealand. It is so beautiful.

34,NestorTheGreat,Misery made funny,7,22 July 2021,"If you like laughing at other's pain, then Boy will have you in stitches! Underage smoking, sextalking and drinking abound as a group of children, presumably abandoned by their parents in the care of their grandmother, are left to fend for themselves while granny goes on a roadtrip. While teachers swear at students, MJ-loving preteens have fist fights and brag about grabbing boobs and fingering their uncles' daughters (because every adult in the film is uncle, aunt or father), in between having a drag, picking pot, and sipping on some beer! The film tries to be heartfelt in the case of the absent mother and her youngest child, who sees everything in cartoons and finds it hard to communicate, but the childish, inappropriate and abusive father, played by the director, overshadows all the sorrow we should feel.The post-credit Bollywood style dance scene sums up this film perfectly, it's a comical, fantastical take of a classic (story) imbued with outbursts of aggression and fear (the haka). If 'comedy' is like the old Italian or Shakespearean plays where parents kill their children or each other and the ""fool"" makes you laugh throughout the tragedy, then this film is up your alley! Worth a watch to see how poverty can still create hope, and despair can cause havoc, but it ain't no Carrey, Sandler nor Ragnarok type of funny!",Boy

We are old and live in Maine USA which is about as far away as you can get from the setting of this movie, but the themes are universal. Poverty, neglect, crime, stupidity, charm, delight, love, The main problem we had was in not always understanding the dialogue, but actually that didn't really matter and with a roku you can back space and catch up. Both the brother actors were wonderful. All the actors were very good. I could not understand what nationality the characters were. My husband said Polynesisan. But that didn't matter.

36,AsifZamir,Is your father perfect?,10,20 November 2013,"Boy is fun movie that takes place in New Zealand. Directed by Taika Waititi, who also wrote the script. The movie is about a young boy everyone simply calls Boy. Boy lives with his grandmother and his brother Rocky and many of his cousins on a poor-farm in New Zealand in the Bay of Plenty area, and is a huge Michael Jackson fan. This is a movie about a boy that meets his real father and realization hits that his father is not as great as he had hoped. The movie brings in the hard facts that Boy's father is a criminal who returns to dig up a bag of money and has very little care for the boy. It is a coming of age movie and depicts real life drug and money issues, but the main issue is absentee fathers.This movie started out with the title Choice and then The Volcano before acquiring its current catchy title. The New Zealand hit won 9 awards and received 8 nominations. Awards included Taika Waititi winning AFI Fest 2010 Audience Award Best International Feature Film and for the Sydney Film Festival 2010 Waititi also won Best Feature Film Audience Award.I think most people will understand and enjoy this movie thanks to a drastic decline in bad fathers in the world.",Boy
37,gooseshaw,Cute little comedy with a lot of heart.,7,8 June 2020,"I want to like Waititi's movies more. I like them a good bit, but I just can't help but find myself somewhat bored sometimes.This movie is pretty cute, funny, and sad. It's lighthearted apart from a couple scenes which end short of any real dramatic tension. And that's not a bad thing. The movie shouldn't be bogged down. It's supposed to be a cute comedy movie, not a tear-jerker.The performances are all great, especially considering it's mostly kids. Waititi himself is fun to watch, and possesses many of the elements that would make a fantastic father, and also many of the elements that make a terrible one.It's it hilarious? No, but it'll make you smile. Is it depressing? No, but it might just bring a tear to your eye. That's how I feel about this movie I guess. Definitely we'll-made and worth the watch if you're considering it.",Boy
38,nekosensei,In between the cars and the Wllderpeople,10,5 May 2019,"If you've seen Waititi's Oscar nominated short ""Two Cars, One Night,"" you were probably thinking, what kind of person would go into a roadhouse at night to do God knows what, leaving their children outside unattended to wait for them? In this film we learn that this is a world where it's considered normal to go out of town for a week or two and leave an eleven-year-old in charge of a houseful of younger children. And when a psychopathic relative shows up, the boy has no choice but to let him in and make the best of it.The message of the shorter film is that even in the midst of the worst neglect and bad influences children have the potential to become better people than the adults around them. ""Boy"" demonstrates this principle in action as the child realizes his father is as grotesquely wrong as a role model as his overhyped idol Michael Jackson. We're left with a sense of relief that growing up to be a better man than either of them will be easy for this boy.This humanist concept of children's potential as ethical beings is further elaborated on, in the form of a young adult story, in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople,"" in which Waititi transitioned from indie auteur to mainstream director without breaking his stride. Looking over the rest of his IMDB resume it's remarkable that even aside from this impressive trilogy he's done so much, and has so many other stories to tell.",Boy
39,noelcox,disappointing,4,11 April 2017,"I realise that most have rated this movie more highly, but personally I found is unsatisfying, somewhat pretentious, and ultimately boring. There were flashes of humour, but I found the story insufficient to sustain a full-length movie, and the the tone of the movie variable. Perhaps it requires a particular view of rural 1980s New Zealand life - and a subculture of that - to appreciate this trifle of a film.",Boy
40,Brantford_Mark,Hidden Gem: An Oscar Winning Storyteller Proves the Power of Family is Strong,9,9 January 2021,"Before there was Thor: Ragnarok or Jojo Rabbit, Taika Waititi crafted this hidden gem. Virtually unknown outside New Zealand, it remains among that country's top grossing films ever. It was his second feature film and is remarkably polished. As writer, director and actor in Boy he has succeeded in showing us that the Power of Family is strong. This is the beautifully paced, episodic story of a ne'er do well Father's return home to his family. Despite his long absence, he remains a godlike figure to his children who are being raised by his mother. Their journey together is a delight to watch.The story is set in 1980's rural New Zealand with a predominantly Maori cast. They eloquently show us that our humanity is universal. Animations bring childhood fantasies all of us have had vividly to life in crayon. Waititi began as a stand up comic, so he has an eye for absurdity. The title character's younger brother Rocky uses secret ""superpowers"" to control the world around him to hilarious effect. His 11 year old brother, Boy, imagines himself so rich he and his father have twin dolphins they ride for leisure. James Rolleston, who plays him, is natural and believable. At no time do you get the sense that anyone is ""acting."" The scenes where they re-enact famous Michael Jackson videos are a total hoot. Ever see a Maori Haka version of the Thriller group dance? Be sure to watch the end titles to catch them all.There's a lot of heart in this story. By its end, we catch a glimmer of what Boy himself will become and how families can shape us for good or ill. There's quite a bit of foul language, drug/alcohol use and criminal behaviour in it, but there are a lot of important family values too. I highly recommend this film for anyone 13+.",Boy
41,Greekguy,Good Boy!,7,5 June 2021,"There's something inherently nice about Taika Waititi's vision of the world; even when he's dealing with superheroes and world-ending calamities as he did in ""Thor: Ragnarok"", he's more interested in friendship and hope than about villainy. In fact, Waititi's on-screen villainy always seems to have some jocular edge poking out somewhere.In this wonderful examination of boyhood, the villain, if there is one at all, ends up being simply a flawed, silly man, while the protagonist, Boy, earns our affection slowly and steadily as he discovers those flaws.This film is a classic coming-of-age film: a boy on the cusp of adolescence learns about love, dreams and disappointment, all while keeping his spirit intact. On the other hand, it's also a film about not coming-of-age, and how that can happen to some of us, without it being a tragedy.The tone is playful, the performances are great and the world that's created is absolutely believable, if perhaps just a little too nice. But then again, it's Waititi's world, so what should we expect?",Boy
42,stephparsons,"Unpretentious, joyous and heartbreaking",8,11 December 2013,"Boy - 2010 'Boy', set on the East Coast of New Zealand, will make you laugh and cry. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, who also plays the role of Boy's Father, Alamein,this movies is unpretentious,devoid of self pity and beautifully acted. The eleven year old Boy (played by James Rolleston),lives with his brother Rocky and three Cousins. They are cared for by an Aunt (whom we never see) because their Mother is dead and their Father is 'away'. The family is a self-sustaining little unit and although they get by, it is clear they are on the breadline. Boy is a bright, happy, innocent child who idolizes Michael Jackson and is over the moon when he finally gets to meet his Father. When his Aunt goes away, Boy must run the household with the help of his young brother and cousins. Initially things run relatively smoothly but that all changes when, out of the blue, the brothers' Father shows up with the intention of digging up a cache of money he buried years ago. Boy is spellbound by this Father he never knew,and idolizes his every move. As Alamein becomes more comfortable around his sons and the house, it is clear he is not particularly interested in,or capable of,taking on the responsibility of child care. Much of his time is spent horsing around with his mates, drinking beer, smoking weed, puffing up his ego and desperately seeking sources of money. Boy, who was previously picked on at school and ignored by the girl he fancied, is now bursting with pride as he shows off his Father to the folks of the small town. Boy's attempts at emulating his Father are almost painful to watch but, as the treasure hunt goes on and on, Alamein's self-absorption, petulance, anger,and abuse of alcohol and drugs initiates a dramatic shift in the dynamic between Father and Son. The beauty of this film is its simplicity, outstanding acting and the combination of matter-of-factness, radiant joy and palpable sorrow expressed by Boy as he deals with the radical changes that befall his family life. If you want to see a thoughtful, intelligent, really well made movie,(and if you don't mind getting the Kleenex out),I thoroughly recommend it.",Boy

Combining unknown actors with a very simple script is a recipe for disaster, in general,BUT not in this film. I think the charm of the movie comes from kids that are playing their roles just perfect:innocent but responsible when need it.The last scene of the movie makes you feel that you've just experienced something unique that comes on the screen once in 10 years!If you manage to get the DVD, invite some friends over and have an '80 night at the movies: all of them they'll feel happy at the end!",Boy

46,TruthSpeaks,No it isn't,4,4 May 2012,"This is not a comedy. The subject matter is somewhat dark; what it's like t grow up with a father who prefers a life of crime to his own children. Are we grading movies from New Zealand on a curve? Almost every internationally distributed movie from New Zealand is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Only it isn't. What I have noticed is that they tend to have a dark streak to them, a sense of menace. Isn't this supposed to be a pretty benevolent place, free health care, a generous social welfare system, etc. The filmmaker spoke at the showing I went to. He was saying that in the eighties, they had ads on New Zealand television telling people not to leave their keys in their cars. I guess they save the darkness for their movies. The events in this movie did not happen to the filmmaker, who said he gets on just fine with his father. This is a professionally produced movie. The acting is very good which is surprising because apparently none of the children were professional actors. The filmmaker played the role of the father, and he was very good. The filmmaker did a good job of portraying neglected children and their broken father. But it tends to get monotonous. Similar things happen over and over. The plot is layers of monotony and darkness. The film changes genres three times. You get the feeling that was more lazy than anything, just throwing anything in there. At first it seems like a comedy, like a lighter, less creepy Wes Anderson and you are delighted. Very shortly it gets dark and monotonous but with touches of comedy. In the end there is a dance scene over the credits.I didn't walk out of this movie but I would possibly not see it again if I knew what it was like. The filmmaker is pretty funny if you get the chance to hear him speak. This movie did not hold the attention of the pre-school children that were there and they were very disruptive. Had they been able to pay attention to it the subject matter would have been too dark for them. Leave the pre-school kids at home. I'm guessing 8 or 10 is the youngest age for this movie.",Boy

Shot in a small town that is genuinely the town that the author/actor (father) actually grew up in. He spoke after our screening, and it was a 30 kid school house, which it still is. Actually the film is a huge success in NZ and the little community gets a small percentage of the gross, so the community is benefiting from this film.The film captures a time and place in history and culture. It is slow and yet the story develops and covers a lot of ground. What I especially loved is that the camera doesn't jump around like Hollywood movies, changing every 5 seconds. It stays with the character. Put on your list!",Boy
48,loganholley,"Far from perfect, but a decent dramedy",8,14 October 2017,"I don't really know what to say about this one - I watched it because I loved Hunt for the Wilderpeople and wanted to see what other films it's director had done. What I found was a more with a far more serious tone, but also a fairly intriguing plot. Don't get me wrong, this film is very flawed in some regards, but the sum of all its pieces is a decent Comedy/Drama that leans a little more on the latter than other films by this director.I think I should start with the positives. First of all, like I said, the plot is very unique. For the sake of spoilers, I won't tell you that much about it, but it's one of the most interesting I've seen in a while. Then, there are the performances. All of the actors, even in minor roles, played their parts to near perfection. This especially counts towards the main character, Boy (played by James Jolleston), and his dad, played by the director himself, Taika Waititi. Best of all here, as with other films by this director, is the cinematography. There were some shots here that left my jaw dropped because of how beautiful they were. Also, as to be expected by Waititi, the dialog here is really snappy and well written - each of the characters felt somewhat real in a sense.Now, this isn't to say this movie is without flaws. I found that this film has tonal inconsistencies at moments, especially later in the film. Something sad will happen, then will be proceeded with joyful, happy music and a scene that doesn't carry the same dramatic weight as the previous one. Also, the ending. Again, I won't be spoiling anything here, but this has one of the most lackluster, confusing, and downright unfitting endings I've ever seen in a film. Another thing that might get on some people's nerves, although didn't bother me, is that this film isn't as funny as the director's other works. It's a very dramatic piece, so go into it with that mindset.All in all, Boy is a decent dramedy. If you like happy movies and cheery endings, this obviously isn't for you - or, you won't like it a whole lot. It's a short film, but in it's running time, it impresses with a unique plot, great performances, excellent cinematography, and witty dialog that brings characters to life. I'm not going to say it's the best film I've ever seen, or my favorite of all the director's work so far, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. One last thing: if you're somewhat afraid about the 'Not Rated' status this film has... yeah, there's definitely some cursing, sexual references, and a bit of violence in this one. It's not too extreme, but I thought I should point that out for some people.",Boy

It's Rich characters and humorous dialogue, entailed by the occasional light-hearted hand drawn animations delivered a hugely entertaining blend of culture, comedy and drama.The story started on a perfect note with Boy played by James Rolleston giving his show and tell speech in the classroom. It introduced the character, his background and set the atmosphere, mood and setting all in one go without being a dull lead up. Taika Waititi (who also plays the dead beat father) did an amazing job in setting out each detailed scene with the occasional Michael Jackson tributes giving the film an even disperse of light-hearted laughs at the same time appropriately moving the plot along. The film gave a heart aching recount on every boy's natural instinct to worship their father, whether they deserve it or not.

All the leads acted beautifully and the story, directing and settings were very well done. It was honest, funny, compassionate, heart-wrenching, powerful and life-affirming.

Boy (Rolleston), a scrawny twelve-year-old with an affinity for Michael Jackson, is tasked with watching his younger brother Rocky and a slew of cousins while his grandmother is away, but things get wild when Boy's estranged, criminal father (Waititi) reappears. Waititi shows the lives of average natives in New Zealand, instead of the war paint wearing behemoths we have come to associate with the Mauri people here in America. In fact, Boy depicts native New Zealander life very similarly to what we see on reservations in America.It's very interesting to see Boy and his family and friends interact on a daily basis. They run free across the town, where everybody know everybody, without a care. But as the film continues, you see that all of them are only a few years away from joining their fathers in jail or activities that could send them to jail.Boy manages to remain an upbeat and energetic film, even while dealing with tough issues like broken families, drug use and death. Waititi's creative take on Boy and his father's rough relationship is both light and poignant, making the film an entertaining watch for anyone who is a fan of Waititi or Michael Jackson.",Boy
57,gtkennedy,Riveting fun from begining to end,10,22 April 2018,A good description of this movie would be a mix of Moonrise Kingdom and Borat (but not as edgy). Watiti shows his prowess as a director and writer through extremely effective cinematography and hilarious but subtle script. The acting and score for this film are almost perfect. And Watiti does a great job of bringing colors into the slums of New Zealand especially in Boy's dream sequences about his father this helps emphasize the child like mood.

58,ananyadunnx,Heartwarming and Humorous,9,4 July 2021,"As it is a film that I have wanted to watch for many months, I am frustrated that I did not watch the 2010 film, Boy, sooner. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, a New-Zealand filmmaker and actor who is most renowned for his work in Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor Ragnorok, Boy is a clear example of the talent Waititi possesses as a creative. As only Waititi's second feature film, it became one of the top-grossing films in New Zealand when released, receiving enthusiastic reviews. The film follows the life of a young boy living in rural New Zealand, humorously named 'Boy'; on the cusp of adolescence, he is struggling to care for his family as well as simultaneously coming to terms with the reality of his life. It is centered around fabricated stories Boy creates to make sense of the absence of his father, played by Taika Waititi, which slowly break down as the film progresses when Boy begins to realise the true nature of his father.Boy is a raw coming of age tale, a hilarious and heartfelt story about idols and magic powers while also recognizing the strength and resilience of kids. This film is a great example of the 'happy-sad' cinematic style that Waititi has mastered so perfectly and has remained a key theme of the films that followed Boy. 'I want to explore the painful comedy of growing up and interpreting the world'- through this, Waititi describes the reason his films become impactful for so many people, owing to his ability to create a connection between the viewers and his characters through the unpleasant and comedic experience of growing up that we all share.

I am smiling as I recall the movie and type this. A good sign! So, Eagle v Shark's quirkiness. Whale Rider's pathos & culture. Bro Town's language skills (who'd have thought ""Egg"" would be so eloquent a derogatory remark!) Second Hand Wedding's humanity, commentary on relationships & our overall resilience. Good things will happen. Every Boy's natural instinct to worship their father - irrespective of whether he's earned it or not - is shown against the halcyon backdrop of an east coast life in Godzone. I laughed out loud at Rockys apology for abuse of his special powers to knock an old fella over. I ached when Boy's Dad returned and the interactions between them - the hero worship meeting with reality; a coming of age. Taika's now customary expansion of characters was excellent - flawed, bravado filled fragile wee worlds we all build up. I have not served Boy adequately in this random review - its an amazing film. 9/10. Made me feel happy & glad to be alive and living in NZ.",Boy
60,kys2,Potential vs the World,9,28 December 2011,"""Boy"" straddles the worlds of bitter and sweet so comfortably that I can't believe this was only Waititi's sophomore feature. I rarely review movies, but I just couldn't stand that a film of this caliber had so little love. I think the reason for this is that it has been marketed as something quintessentially New Zealander. Which is absolutely true. And completely irrelevant to how much you will enjoy this film.Some things are universal and as ""Boy"" teaches us, two of those things are Michael Jackson, and that world-shattering humiliation that seems to haunt our adolescence.Boy is a an unremarkable kid growing up in an even more unremarkable world. Having lost his mother during the birth of his younger brother, Rocky, he's looked after by his Nan and is often responsible for Rocky and his younger cousins. His absent father is a samurai warrior, champion boxer, and deep sea treasure hunter. When this god-among-men finally shows up (just after Boy's grandmother is called away) reality and fantasy collide.The funny moments are more hilarious than any out-and-out comedy I can remember and while ""Boy"" has moments of drama, they are all played with a subtle hand and carried out believably by the actors (who I'd never heard of before). It's a coming-of-age film and very male orientated. There are sequences so beautiful and fantastical, you only see them in these pieces crafted through a haze of loving nostalgia. Both Boy and his father seem painfully real. They're hoping, but afraid to hope, and covering it in a thin veneer of masculine bravado. The film asks all those typical questions of the genre about what it means to be a man in a world where the men are rarely role-model material.What could be a dank, gritty piece about poverty and deadbeat dads is transformed through Boy's dreams and the sketches from Rocky, (a superhero in the making) who sees more than anyone and says far less.The accents are pretty thick (I'm an Aussie from a thick-accented region and still missed a word or two) but if you can make it through that, I can't imagine an audience that wouldn't enjoy this film. (Oh, and please, please watch the final scene and appreciate it for exactly what it is. I know people have complained that it was meaningless and didn't tie anything up, but who cares? A haka-flavoured ode to Thriller is just as wonderful and ridiculous as you'd imagine. But, if the scene has to mean anything, and I doubt it does, it would be that dreams beat reality every damn time!)",Boy

63,jacobjamessturgess,"Another insight into Waititi's iconic world, but a little too familiar",7,28 February 2011,"Taika Waititi, director of the kooky oddity that is Eagle vs. Shark, continues to do what he does best in his second feature Boy. The coming of age story, based around two young brothers, succeeds in maintaining the brand of deadpan humour and parochial quirkiness that made his previous film so memorable. Boy is full of the rustic allure of Eagle vs. Shark and fans of Waititi will surely not be disappointed here. However, the director's first film was picked up on for being a little too similar to the cult hit Napoleon Dynamite, and his second feature is certainly not treading any new ground. The story is set in 1984 and revolves around a loud and proud eleven year old (James Rolleston) a kiwi country-dweller whose dolt father Alamein (Waititi) returns after a long time away. The father brings Boy and his brother (Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu) all manner of stolen gifts and tall tales from the wider world, (particularly regarding the newly released E.T), but in time Boy comes to realise that his father might not be the all action hero his vivid imagination has led him to believe. Rolleston is outstanding in the role, and couldn't be more fitted to Waititi's iconic vision. He succeeds in being at once an adorable scamp and a mature, considerate actor as he comes to slowly understand the true value of family.Waititi seems, however, to have simply lifted the character of Jarrod straight from Eagle vs. Shark and just renamed him Alamein in Boy. Both characters live in alarmingly similar fantasy worlds, both have illusions of grandeur, and both are unable to care for their young children because of their sheer juvenility. While this similarity does not render the film inert, one does expect more from a director with such potential and opportunity than effortless echoes of characters past.Certain differences are apparent, however; Boy being warmer, friendlier and more genuine if a little less amusing. There is a positively glowing moment when the younger brother Rocky, misconstruing the tales of E.T, skates serenely across his garage towards his father, and calmly places a hand on his forehead. It is not clear what exactly Rocky is using his powers to heal in his father – the cuts and bruises left from a fight with a rival gang, his heartache for his lost lover or the essential sickness with which the character is riddled, but the severity with which he conducts this ludicrous task remains heart-warming.The film was set around none other than Waititi's old house, using genuine props from his childhood, and although his father was not an escaped convict, it is obvious that there is a lot of truth at the core of the film. All in all, Boy is a charming escapade into 80's nostalgia, coloured with the telltale sedated humour of the New Zealand's new wave of cinema. Despite not breaking the mould, Waititi delivers an emotive, thoughtful and thoroughly engaging story about the fantasy of childhood colliding inelegantly with reality.",Boy
64,laptas,A feel good/charming film I could watch again and again,10,12 September 2020,"I really adore this movie. I find this comedy/drama genre to be very entertaining and I quite enjoy watching it. In fact, I can easily say that this movie finely represents the genre. It is a coming of age story about a young boy living in New Zealand in the 1980's, directed by Taika Waititi. The story mainly revolves around this boy, who goes by the name Boy, and his absent criminal father whose only reason of coming back to his family is finding the buried bag of money he left behind years ago. The movie also focuses on Boy's everyday life and his relationship with his friends and family in a very unique and witty way. My favourite thing about the film is its originality and humor that the characters deliver so naturally. But even though the film has its fair share of charming and light-hearted moments, on the other hand, as the movie continues we can't help but kind of feel heart-broken and empathetic for the character. What I love about Taika is his original sense of humor and his ability to blend both humor and heart in his films. That is one of the main reasons why I really cherish him as a filmmaker. I can honestly say I'm excited for his future projects.",Boy
65,HamiltonRaglan,A refreshing eccentric version of a road well travelled,10,5 April 2010,"I went along to this film hoping that it would not be an awkward repeat of the Maori-against-the-world-old-chestnut that seems to pop up far too commonly here in NZ: and I was not disappointed!This was a fantastically enjoyable film that managed to tackle some prolifically odious practices that (still) exist (illicit gang affiliation, the lack of reasonable care and responsibility for children, drug abuse, poverty) without being gratuitously violent. Surprisingly, and very refreshingly, the writer even succeeded to make this film wonderfully heart warming and funny.Thoroughly recommended.",Boy
66,y_bogusz,Fantastic movie -great unlike most of USA garbage movie,9,11 April 2010,I went to see this movie because I have taken a liking to New Zealand made movies for their good and meaningful story lines unlike what the the USA churns out.Once again I was not disappointed. What a hoot.Great entertaining and funny.May be a low budget made movie but a great outcome for director. Well done.Hey maybe the Americans should learn from this country how to make great meaningful movies that leave you with good thoughts. I would like to know how a small country makes such great movies. Are the directors and actors going to the right training school or is it that they have just approach things in a new fresh light and choose actors who are not from Hollywood with all their glitter but with natural core ability.9 out of 10,Boy
67,thestripcartoonist,Didn't know whether to laugh or cry... so I did both... couldn't help it!,10,3 November 2011,"How do I this film justice without explicitly explaining the nuanced hilariousness of it all? OK, so there is this underlying sadness at the children's' misfortune, this subtle pity for their future, and this unease as the ""father"" turns up all ""cool"" with his two inept mates. But then there are so many points I had to not burst out laughing really REALLY loudly - didn't help I was watching it late in bed. There's not much sentimentality, but you're kind of wanting their to be. So when at the end its poised to potentially provide some... well, I cried more than I have for any film in very long time.But then I was in stitches - almost instantly. Terrific juxtaposition of emotions! Totally what I look for in a film - as well as a little escapism.",Boy
68,coolhandsax,"Funny, moving, nostalgic, absolutely beautiful movie.",10,27 March 2012,"I came across this movie purely by chance whilst following links across the internet & boy am I glad I did! (If you'll excuse the pun). I've never been to NZ but have worked & socialised with plenty of Kiwis over the years & a bit of basic awareness of NZ culture (Long live the Dog!) is certainly an advantage in getting the most out of this film. However, do not despair ye of limited knowledge for there is a veritable cornucopia of every human emotion served up for your delectation that will appeal to all regardless of class, creed, health, wealth or beauty. And when the latest blockbuster rom-com/superhero/zombie/action-or- whatever flick has faded to a bland, slightly recalled, insignificance 'Boy' will still be with you. A line of dialogue, a cheeky face, a child's drawing, something will surface at the most unexpected moment that will induce a warm cosiness, a feeling of everything is going to be OK & a slightly stupid grin will probably slip onto your face. But there's the rub folks, because your chances of seeing it in your local multiplex are non-existent. TV can re-run 40 year old James Bond movies ad infinitum whilst neglecting gems like this & you will probably only be reading this review if you've already seen the film & are checking out previous work by those involved. So in the end we all lose, such a shame as, now more than ever, we need movies like these that rise above our petty daily grievances and give us all a feeling of wanting to belong to a more generous, carefree & happy society.",Boy
69,TroyWoodfield,This movie is a little Gem! Recommended.,9,12 April 2010,"This New Zealand made movie had me laughing and entertained right from the outset. In fact, within the first five minutes, there were more laughs than some comedy movies manage to achieve in their entirety. The movie 'Boy' is proof that a good script, decent characters and plenty of laughs produces a better result than big budget movies with no originality and plenty of marketing.Go and see this -- but only if you like decent movies, 1980 references, laughing and characters you'll care about; a blend of serious under-currents wrapped up in quirky NZ humor.For New Zealand viewers, some of the scenes will seem so familiar; something you'll be able to relate to...but anyone can watch this.",Boy

72,contactcomm1,Such a jewel of a movie,10,20 November 2016,"In all its simplicity and quirkiness this has become my favourite movie of all time. There are actually many layers to this film and it deals with a wide array of topics regarding the human condition in a humorous and playful manner. Heart wrenching scenes dealing with the loss of a parent, loneliness and rejection are masterfully interwoven with the beauty of imagination as seen through the eyes of the young protagonist. I always have been fascinated by Maori culture and it was endearing to see how young Maori's struggle to find meaning and happiness in their lives. This movie is well acted, incredibly well cast and beautifully put together in all aspects. If you have not seen this film yet, please go and watch it with your whole family. I assure you that you will all enjoy the experience!",Boy
73,shillitod,An absolute triumph of a movie on every level.,9,22 April 2010,"This is simply one of the best New Zealand movies made in any century. The story is a richly charactered, well researched, emotionally powerful, and hugely entertaining blend of culture, comedy, music, and drama. I absolutely take my hat off(not that I usually wear one) to Taika Cohen and his crew, they have delivered one of the best films of this year, and that being from all countries. The story is well documented by other users so I won't bore you with the details of that, but for me the main talking point of this film is the exquisite performances of the two lead children. While James Rolleston as Boy has a very vocal part in the film his delivery, range of emotions, and expressions are so important to the film's success, and he pulls this off with such ease, and is such a joy to watch. His fragile brother Rocky, played by Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu, turns in to be what I consider one of the best and most emotionally powerful performances from a child in any film I have seen. His role is largely speechless(though he certainly has a share of words to deliver) yet he is able to convey what his character is thinking and feeling through facial expressions, and almost in a sense through his eyes. I cannot recommend this film enough, we went to see it two days ago and I am still smiling from the memory of this great film. The incorporation of Michael Jackson tributes into the film could have been hard to pull off in some movies, yet here Cohen blends these in to the mix with great effect, in particular the final scene which simply has to seen to be fully appreciated. The comedy elements have universal appeal, and are well dispersed throughout the film.Just go see it when you are able, as simple as that. Brilliant...........",Boy
74,benthefilmer,What a wonderful film,10,19 May 2020,"There is something about this film that stands out from all the other coming-of-age stories. Its not just the superb writing and the impeccable character development, its the sincerity of it all. Beneath the hilarious bits of lighthearted banter and comedic aspects, there is a deep emotional level that is never ignored. The genuine moments of pain and sorrow aren't shown in an over-the-top way, in fact, some of these deep emotions are often hidden between the lines; they are more effective, more open hearted, and real.It hurts my heart to know that some children around the world have to grow up earlier than they should, just to stay alive and somewhat healthy. It reminds me of where I am, what I have, and how wonderful my family is. I deal with my own personal demons and traumas that I must face, as do you all. This movie reminds me that every single person faces different hardships, which is why comparing each other's lives and trying to tell which life is harder to live is impossible. Its all perspective.",Boy
