0,MartinHafer,"at times, mindless script, but watch it and say you love it just to make liberals mad!",5,22 July 2006,"This film was pretty controversial when it came out because it bucked the theme being touted by liberal politicians in 1984. They wanted the US to engage the Russians and make nice to them, while President Reagan had the nerve to call this evil empire an ""evil empire"". The public seemed to either hate the movie for having the affront to show a Communist invasion of the USA or conservatives thought it was all cool and somehow prophetic. I went to see it, in part, just because I wanted to irritate liberal friends by telling them I saw this movie! After all, it was just a movie! And, a fantasy involving a right or left-wing plot is certainly fair game (though critics at the time BBQ'd the movie and branded it as evil).Now as for the movie itself, if you remove all the political baggage, it is a decent but far from great film--and people on both extremes politically should bend a little--the film ISN'T evil nor is it the greatest film ever made! Instead, it's a fantasy first. And, secondly it is kind of fun to watch but pretty brainless--having lots of action scenes but the dialog and acting is right out of a teen movie! Judge the film on its own merits, not just politics. Those who give it a 1, do so for their own agenda as is the same with them that give this mediocre film a 10! Don't believe all the extreme hype!",Red Dawn
1,bkoganbing,Call Out The Wolverines,7,9 July 2007,"The scenario depicted in Red Dawn didn't happen as we all know. The Cold War ended with a fadeout instead of a bang, the USA did not get invaded. At first glance Red Dawn seems like a quaint and ancient propaganda piece, but it still raises some interesting issues.Note how the invasion of America happened. Lots and lots of illegal aliens crossed our borders and infiltrated from within. Back in the day Red Dawn was National Rifle Association recruiting material, today however it's the film that the strict immigration people must love the most.Several members of the Eighties Brat Pack gave stand out performances in Red Dawn like Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson and Charlie Sheen. Considering what he's peddling now, I wonder if Charlie Sheen likes to be reminded of his participation in Red Dawn. Swayze and Howell are brothers who when the paratroop invasion happens at their high school, they zoom on out of there, take supplies, weapons and ammunition and lead a guerrilla movement in their little corner of Colorado.It's fascinating that the northeast of the United States didn't get invaded and that was the Free Zone. You wonder if the young people in blue state America would fight as these kids do. Kids like Howell and Swayze today are what make up our Armed Forces, they are a precious commodity indeed, blood not to be spent extravagantly or unwisely.Red Dawn is dated in some ways, relevant in others. It's super-patriotic, jingoistic, never explains really but for a brief voice over prologue why all these people don't like us. But at the same time it invokes a fighting spirit in America that I hope never dies, because we will die.It's nice to discuss geopolitics, look for economic solutions to age old problems, try to make people respect each other's differences. When the bombs are dropped though, discussion and reason are over.",Red Dawn
2,Leofwine_draca,"Passable right-wing entertainment, but it's not a film I'll be coming back to",5,25 October 2016,"I'm not a big fan of '80s teen movies here – show me a John Hughes title and I'll probably run a mile (apart from HOME ALONE, which I have a nostalgic soft spot for). So when I heard about RED DAWN, a film about American teenagers fighting back against a Russian invasion, I didn't get my hopes up too much. The film is far too mainstream to offer any really cutting edge kind of thrills, so instead we're left with a bloated mess, full of average action scenes shot with little flourish or flair and plenty of soul-searching dialogue which got on my nerves after a while. I have a feeling that the Chuck Norris B-movie INVASION USA is a lot more entertaining than this flick.However, it's not all bad. It has a great director in John Milius, and he re-teams with CONAN THE BARBARIAN composer Basil Poledouris so there's a decent soundtrack. There's a big budget and action a-plenty involving shoot-outs, tanks and RPGs; some of the good guy deaths are quite moving. The script isn't all I hoped for, but there's an epic, wide-scale sense to the action which isn't half bad. It's mainly the youthful cast I have problems with. The likes of Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, and Charlie Sheen are all here, but they lack the definition that made them successful Hollywood actors in their own right. There are touches of individuality and acting ability but for the most part they seem faceless, just another figure in an ensemble group. The same goes for BACK TO THE FUTURE's Lea Thompson and DIRTY DANCING's Jennifer Grey. It takes some older actors like the excellent Powers Boothe and baddie William Smith to show them how to act.All in all, RED DAWN is a 'big' '80s film but in the end I found it a little bland for my tastes. There's a good downbeat climax, but the pacing issues up to then make it feel like an all-too-simple case of fight-talk-fight-talk ad nauseum. I enjoyed it, but it's not one I'll be watching again.",Red Dawn
3,SnoopyStyle,Great action propaganda movie,8,11 October 2013,"Patrick Swayze leads a group of Colorado teens in guerrilla war against Soviets and Cubans. The group has a great young cast that includes C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Charlie Sheen, and Jennifer Grey. Powers Boothe plays fighter pilot Lt. Col. Tanner who parachutes into their group.To say this is an exaggerated right wing propaganda would be too easy. The first minute of the movie lists a whole bunch of unreasonable unrealistic oversimplification of the worst case political scenarios that could never be. To understand how stupid is to read a simple history book. Whereas this movie predicts the end of western civilization, in reality the Berlin Wall would fall in only 5 years time.As an action shoot them up movie, this starts off quickly. The Russian are landing within the first 5 minutes. They're off and running. They never look back. They use all the hokey tricks and it all works. It's got a great young cast, and it's got great flow to the story. It's a fun and easy movie.",Red Dawn
4,kosmasp,Different times,6,19 May 2013,"The movie did hit something when it was first released. Back then (the 80s that is), the scenario of an invasion wasn't that far fetched. Unfortunately the movie did not age that well. While it still has some thrills and momentum going for it (and the acting is decent enough), you shouldn't expect to be as excited as viewers who watched it in its initial run.Having said that, the remake that was made in 2012 was even more unrealistic. But more on that movie on its own page. One of the few similarities that they sort of got right, was the casting. There's too much depending on luck and coincidence for my taste. Still a ""classic"" that is worth a watch, even if it is just to get the mood people where in back then.",Red Dawn
5,gavin6942,"Good Nostalgia, Not a Great Film",6,6 March 2017,"It is the dawn of World War III. In southwestern America and Colorado, a group of teenagers bands together to defend their town, and their country, from invading Soviet forces.""Red Dawn"" is one of those films that becomes legendary in hindsight. With Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson and more before their biggest roles, you cannot help but be impressed by the ensemble cast. But despite that, there is a lot left wanting here. Much of the plot is nonsense. We are given the impression that either a) the Russians control this one city in the middle of the country or b) they have taken over most of the United States overnight. I am not sure which is more hard to believe.The message is also very unclear. Coming from John Milius, there has to be a message. He is a towering personality, with strong opinions. But is this pro-war, anti-war, pro-freedom? We cheer for the Wolverines, but at the same time we see the Cuban (or Mexican?) colonel in a very human way, and at one point the question is bluntly asked -- how are we (Americans) different from them (Russians)? The answers are hard to find.",Red Dawn
6,Hey_Sweden,Avenge me. Avenge me!,7,22 May 2017,"Political paranoia time. This obviously very memorable 80s product of the Cold War puts forth a chilling ""what if"" scenario. In this case, the Cold War has a different outcome, and legions of Russians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans aggressively invade the U.S. of A. However, a small band of high school students in Colorado are able to head for the hills. While they are in seclusion, they begin to use whatever supplies and weapons they've acquired, and rise up righteous to kick tons of evil Commie ass.If you can lay aside your personal political beliefs, this does function as an interesting, sometimes believable action thriller that forces people to answer a serious question. If your own country were invaded like this, would YOU be able to rise to the challenge? It's because the premise touches people in that way that makes it a compelling enough entertainment. Obviously, the war and violence here are not glorified, but are treated as something unavoidable. Our band of heroes do have quite a bit of success, but they're also not infallible, and aren't experienced soldiers despite whatever training they might have had.Many of the bad guys are pretty one dimensional, but not all of them. One of the most intriguing characters is a Cuban colonel (Ron ""Superfly"" O'Neal) who has his doubts about the whole conflict, and who yearns to be back home with his beloved.Action scenes and stunts are well executed by Terry Leonard, and the movie does manage to have some fairly punchy gore despite a PG-13 rating. At its best, ""Red Dawn"" is vivid, disconcerting, and rousing, perfectly punctuated by Basil Poledouris' soaring score.The kids are played by Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey, and others, and they do alright, but the older generation is particularly strong: Ben Johnson, Lane Smith, Harry Dean Stanton, Frank McRae, Roy Jenson, etc. ""Red Dawn"" does hit its stride upon the introduction of the Powers Boothe character, and then the top dog villain played by the eternally bad ass William Smith (who speaks fluent Russian).""Red Dawn"" is the kind of film that can engender purely personal responses. Still, it's undeniable that it truly does hit a nerve. It would make a fine double feature with ""Invasion U.S.A."", a Chuck Norris vehicle from the following year.Directed by John Milius, who also receives screenplay credit with Kevin Reynolds.Seven out of 10.",Red Dawn
7,poolandrews,Not that good.,4,9 July 2008,"Red Dawn starts like any other day in a small Colorado town, however the normal tranquillity is soon shattered when Russian soldiers parachute out of the sky & start killing everyone. In a systematic coordinated attack right across America starting in Mexico allied Soviet & Cuban forces have invaded the US & World War III has begun. Brother's Jed (Patrick Swayze) & Matt Eckert (Charlie Sheen) along with several of their high school buddies manage to escape the initial invasion & make it to the relative safety of the Colorado mountains. With no option but to fight the teenagers take arms & wage their own personal war against the Soviet Cuban scum who have invaded their homeland & killed innocent Americans...Co-written & directed by avid gun collector & pro-gun activist John Milius one has to say that I really didn't think too much of this overly sentimental teenage action film. The script by Milius & Kevin Reynolds takes itself deadly seriously & is very pro the right to bear arms all the way, it says that the right of each American to own a gun is good because America is the land of the free & in the event of an attack by the Russians or any other evil superpower individual Americans will be able to defend themselves. I suppose Red Dawn tries to tap into the fears people had at the time, fears about Cummunism, about Russia, about World War III, about nuclear warfare, about increasing legislation in owning a gun which Red Dawn repeatedly says owning a gun is every American's God given right & the whole survivalist movement. The character's aren't great, there's the clichéd action film theme of ordinary people being thrust into an extraordinary situation & having to toughen-up & overcome the odds, you know the sort of thing I mean. Nothing really works that well, while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together & you never get to know any of the character's, in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart. The film never leaves the confines of the Colorado town either & I for one never really felt like the whole of the US was at war. At almost two hours it felt like it went on forever, the action isn't anything special & it's hard to believe a group of teenagers could take on & defeat a heavily armed platoon of highly trained soldiers. I read somewhere once that someone thought Red Dawn resembled The Goonies (1985) but with guns & rocket launchers which I think is actually quite an apt description.Director Milius nails his allegiances down here, there are some really nauseating scenes of gross patriotism which I found rather laughable. The scene of the teenagers listening to the radio & the American national anthem comes on to keep the nations spirits up is just so forced & cheap it's untrue. Red Dawn was the very first film released with a PG-13 rating in the states, The Flamingo Kid (1984) was actually the first film to be given a PG-13 but Red Dawn ended up being released before it. There is a fairly high body count & a fair amount of blood too although it's not that graphic it is quite violent & whether Red Dawn would still get a PG-13 today is debatable. Amazingly the term 'Red Dawn' was the given code name for the military operation in Iraq that captured Saddam Hussein back in 2003!The film is well made with decent production values, the military vehicles & the like look very authentic I suppose & the New Mexico location shooting has some nice scenery. There are several sizable parts of the film which are subtitled. The acting is in my opinion very poor, the likes of Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen in his film debut, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton & Powers Boothe are capable of much better than this & some of the performances are truly dire.Red Dawn is not a film that I can say I liked, it's pro-war pro-gun patriotic nonsense that has dated very badly & is a bit of a chore to sit through in one sitting. Apparently set to be remade as Red Dawn (2010).",Red Dawn
8,lastliberal,Boys! Avenge me! Aveeeeenge me!,6,10 May 2007,"This film has so much right-wing propaganda that I felt I was watching the Republican Convention.A group of teens with deer rifle takes on crack combat troops and we are supposed to believe that. I am sure glad that Patrick Swayze grew up in the five years before Road House.He did reunite with fellow cast member Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing. She was cute as a button in this movie, but could not save it for me.If you some some red meat propaganda, then you can sure find it here.

9,zardoz-13,Stars and Stripes Forever!!!,8,22 November 2012,"Youngsters grow up quickly in ""Conan the Barbarian"" director John Milius' ""Red Dawn,"" an exciting, bittersweet, jingoistic, Reagan-era military actioneer with a provocative but far-fetched premise. The Soviet Union with its Cuban and Nicaraguan allies invade the United States. The film opens with a preface designed to sum up in short-hand the tense global situation in the fewest words possible. ""Soviet Union suffers worst wheat harvest in 55 years. Labor and food riots in Poland. Soviet troops invade. Cuban and Nicaragua reach troop strength goals of 500,000. El Salvador and Honduras fall. Greens Party gains control of West German Parliament. Demands withdrawal of nuclear weapons from European soil. Mexico plunged into revolution. NATO dissolves. United States stands alone."" These words appear as blood red text against a black background. As improbable as the premise sounds, Milius and co-scenarist Kevin Reynolds of ""Robin Hood"" fame turn it into a propaganda-style shoot'em up. This contemporary yarn unfolds in quiet, peaceful, little hamlet of Calumet, Colorado, in September. Enemy paratroopers drift down in the first scene while a high school history teacher, Teasdale (Frank McRae of ""License to Kill"") is lecturing them to class about the tactics of the great Ghenghis Khan. He goes outside to find out what's happening and shot to death by a soldier. The students and an older brother Jed (Patrick Swayze of ""Ghost"") flee into the scenic mountainous terrain with the blessing of their parents who loads them up with provisions. Our heroes take in two girls and tensions rise among the group when the girls refuse to serve in secondary roles. Later, they participate in the combat. One of them trades on her good looks to lure enemy soldiers into either ambushes or plant explosives. Clearly, this war picture leaves nobody in doubt to the ending, but the finale isn't sugar-coated. One scene straight out of a World War II propaganda scene occurs when one of our dying heroines booby-traps her body to kill a Russian soldier. Another scene straight out of an old frontier western occurs when our heroes conceal themselves underground to stage an ambush. Important characters bite the dust, and even teenagers perish during the initial enemy attack. The cast is a veritable who's who of raw talent including Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen in his cinematic debut, Lea Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, and Jennifer Grey. Swayze and Grey would team up again later in ""Dirty Dancing,"" but here they have to dance dirty with murderous Russian troops. William Smith is terrific as the villainous Russian officer Strelnikov. Veteran Polish character actor Vladek Sheybal of ""From Russia with Love"" plays a Soviet officer. Composer Basil Poledouris provides an energetic as well as atmospheric orchestral soundtrack. The early aerial scenes as the camera flies through the clouds to the strains of Poledouris' martial music is stirring stuff. This represented one of the rare opportunities for veteran heavy Roy Jenson to play a sympathetic character. Several other anti-Soviet films were released when ""Red Dawn"" came out. Clint Eastwood's ""Firefox"" preceded ""Red Dawn"" by two years, while ""Rocky IV"" appeared the following year. Director John Milius never lets the action bog down in sentiment. There is one grueling scene when Swayze's character insists that the youngster staunch their tears in the aftermath of their loved ones demise. Jed and Matt wind up dying together on a picnic table. Matt dies first in Jed's arms and Jed groans about being tired. In the wrap-up, the narrator indicates neither Jed nor Matt were heard of again. America won World War III. ""Red Dawn"" gets gritty at times and isn't as upbeat as the remake.",Red Dawn
10,grantss,Entertaining WW3 drama,6,10 April 2016,"Entertaining WW3 drama.Russia launches a surprise attack on and invasion of the USA. A small town in Colorado experiences this first hand when Russian paratroopers land in the town and quickly take it over. A small group of teenagers from the local high school, calling themselves the Wolverines, manage to escape into the mountains and start to fight back.Quite entertaining. Yes, it was made during the Cold War so is a tad propagandic and, some might say, dated. However, it is still relevant today to a degree, due to Vladimir Putin doing his utmost to restart the Cold War. Always good to see the Ruskies get their rear ends kicked.Much grittier than I imagined. Being centred around teens and thus aimed at teens I imagined it would pull its punches and present a Disneyised version of war, complete with empty sentimentality and idealised versions of honour, chivalry and the like. Was pleasantly surprised to see that it didn't go down this path. The scene with the prisoner and the traitor rams that point home.Plot is a bit basic and direction more focused on action than drama, so the movie is certainly no Citizen Kane. However, it has great momentum and is never dull.Main cast includes many stars-to-be: Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey (in her second feature film), Lea Thompson and C Thomas Howell. Swayze does well but is a bit miscast, looking to old for his part. Turns out, that, while his character is 18 or so, Swayze was 32! Supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton, Powers Boothe and William Smith.Good fun.",Red Dawn
11,Boba_Fett1138,Wolverines!,6,25 July 2007,"The story is kept pretty simple and straightforward and also touched a sensitive nerve at the time, since the cold war was still fully going on at the time. It's about the Russians and Cubans invading the United States and thereby unleashing WW III. The movie focuses on a small group of teenagers in a small American town, who turn themselves into an effective guerrilla force, named the Wolverines, to battle the communist invaders.But the movie does not really have a sense of realism. The movie doesn't feel like this could have ever or shall ever really occur. It's because the movie is rather simple. It also doesn't really tries to provoke or anything. This movie feels more like a spoof of what can actually happen than a serious movie trying to make a statement and sent out a warning. It's hard to ever take this movie seriously and just see it for what it is; pure entertainment.All of the Russians and Cubans are extremely stereotypical evil and their methods and regime reminds more of the WW II Nazi-regime. But I think that the movie also does a good job as portraying the Americans not as kind-hearted peace loving folks. It shows that nobody is really innocent in a war time situation and you're being forced into things you normally wouldn't ever do or even think of.The movie its battle sequence are pretty good looking. The invasion forces and their weapons look good and realistic and the movie has some nice action sequences. Overall the movie really does give you the sense and feeling of an actual war-time situation.The movie also has some nice looking scenery and with yet another awesome musical score from Basil Poledouris, who did some of his best work with director John Milius.The movie has a great '80's cast with big names from that period such as Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey and Harry Dean Stanton. Grey and Swayze would later work together again as the two main characters in ""Dirty Dancing"", despite the fact that they didn't like each other very much personally.It's not really a great movie but interesting to watch nevertheless because of its concept.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Red Dawn
12,view_and_review,We Better Build That Wall,1,19 July 2019,"This movie is some patriotic superhero garbage. This is so far from reality it's not even worth entertaining. Somehow, Cubans and Russians drop right onto American soil and occupy parts of it. And get this: their plan hinged on illegal aliens! Yeah, some illegal aliens infiltrated America like a Trojan horse and opened it up for the Communists.Hurry up Trump and build that wall.In this tale the commies decide to invade a part of Colorado, of all places, and somehow the U.S. military is powerless to stop them. No worry, we have Jed (Patrick Swayze) and Matt (Charlie Sheen). They and their small army of high school kids are better than anything the U.S. army could produce.I'm not Russian, Cuban, or anti-American but it's hard for me to imagine that Cuba and Russia got as far as they got to be undone by kids. The whole scenario is a teenager's fantasy.But I knew this movie was absurd when I heard Jed and Matt's father. He was stuck in some ""re-education camp"" when they stopped by to visit him. He had some parting words for them and amongst those parting words were:""Avenge me! Avenge me!""What!? Really!?American soil is invaded by communist Cubans and Russians and he's worried about himself being avenged?!

13,Uriah43,Entertaining to a Degree--but Totally Absurd as Well,5,6 June 2019,"This film begins in a small town in Colorado some time in the month of September with Cuban soldiers parachuting next to the local high school and opening fire on everyone within sight. Soon a massive army has taken over the town with only a few teenagers being able to escape the hail of bullets all around. So with nowhere else to go they load up on supplies and head to the mountains not too far away to plan their next move. Not long afterward they learn that World War III has broken out and with the death or imprisonment of everyone they love they decide to form their own small partisan army and take the fight to enemy. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that even though the entire premise is totally absurd, the movie itself wasn't too bad overall. At least, it wasn't when it first came out. However, having seen it again 35 years later I can honestly say that it hasn't aged very well and has to be taken within the context of being a product of its time. That being said, while it certainly wasn't a great film by any means, I still got some enjoyment out of it and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Red Dawn
14,AaronCapenBanner,Wolverines!,8,11 December 2013,"John Milius directed this rousing speculative film accounting what might happen if foreign forces(led by the Soviets and Cubans) suddenly invaded the U.S. without warning because of escalating tensions. In a Colorado town, on a wintry morning, high school students witness just that, as their teachers are shot, and enemy soldiers take over, forcing a group of students(played by Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, among others) escape into the mountains, and figure out what to do next, eventually becoming guerrilla fighters who are hunted by the enemy, but prove quite resilient, even impressing a downed ally pilot played by Powers Boothe. Exciting crowd-pleaser is well-directed, entertaining and thought-provoking, with not all Americans acting honorably(some collaborate) but a deep patriotic spirit here is commendable, with some quite realistic touches and believable characterizations.",Red Dawn
15,Aaron1375,The ads made this seem a lot more gruesome than it turned out. Turned out to be a standard action flick.,6,7 October 2010,"This film from the first trailers I saw as a kid made this film to look really hardcore and a bit scary for a kid my age. The actual film though turned out to be just a little bit more than your standard action flick of the 80's and compared to others it was even a bit tame. The plot is way out there, as the Russians and Cubans are invading the United States on our home soil, apparently evading all our radars and things of that nature too. If you can get passed the improbability of this happening then it is an okay action movie. For me, the initial attack scenes were the best as the kids at their school have to get in the older brother's truck and make their escape to the mountains. From there it turns into a youth attack force movie where all the characters you get to know start being killed off and you are left wondering if any of them will survive. The cast is good, full of a lot of young talent and Patrick Swayze who is the best of this bunch. They add a couple of females to the mix later in the film, and there are some nice scenes involving people digging their own graves and stuff. I just find the movie feels a bit to long as the movie lasts under two hours, but feels a half hour longer. There are some good kills, but nothing that is going to be as good as a Rambo movie. So while it has its moments of being sort of good, it just fails to impress overall. Just a standard action film that is eh in areas.",Red Dawn
16,Wuchakk,Communist attack on American soil in the early 80s,5,8 June 2015,"John Milius' ""Red Dawn"" (1984) details the somber adventures of a group of Colorado youths who flee into the mountains when communist paratroopers storm their town. Patrick Swayze plays the leader of the group and Charlie Sheen his brother. Other youths are played by Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Darren Dalton, C. Thomas Howell and Doug Toby. Powers Boothe is on hand as a pilot who joins-up with the youths while Ron O'Neal plays a Nicaraguan officer who becomes war-weary. Ben Johnson and William Smith have small roles as an aging American and a hardcore communist respectively.You can tell that ""Red Dawn"" took a lot from 1970's ""Hornets' Nest"" about Italian kids teaming up with an American paratrooper to defeat the invading Germans. The main differences with ""Hornets' Nest"" are that the kids are much younger and the story takes place in Italy during WWII rather than America in the early 80s. Like that film, ""Red Dawn"" even provides a sympathetic enemy officer. Howard Hawks supplied the simplest definition of a good movie: ""Three great scenes. No bad scenes."" While ""Red Dawn"" doesn't have many (or any) great scenes it has quite a few that are pretty effective and memorable, like the execution of a traitor and communist soldier on the prairie. Unfortunately it has too many lame scenes or elements, like the overly gung-ho patriotic score (Basil Poledouris). Don't get me wrong, I'm as patriotic as the next person, but some of the patriotic trappings of this movie are absolutely eye-rolling. I consider Milius a great writer/director, as verified by 1979's ""Apocalypse Now"" and 1982's ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but parts of ""Red Dawn"" are sickenly melodramatic or downright lame. Melodrama only works when you create well-defined characters, which isn't done here. Plus there's no build-up of suspense. There's an opening classroom scene with the kids at school and then WHAM the communists drop from the sky and the teens head into the mountains. Moreover, despite Milius' impressive resume some parts of ""Red Dawn"" smack of amateur filmmaking. On the good side, the film has a quality cast of up-and-comers and tried-and-truers. In addition, the remote Western locations are great, there's a lot of action and a few of the melodramatic scenes show glimmerings of greatness. The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in northern New Mexico, just south of Colorado. GRADE: C+",Red Dawn
17,zetes,"Despite its goofy, paranoid plot, it's a good movie",8,15 June 2008,"Infamous piece of right-wing paranoia, involving a group of teens fighting a guerrilla war against invading Russians, Cubans and Nicaraguans. It's a joke of a film, one of those you'd only watch if you want to see a movie that's so bad it's good, right? Well, no, actually. If you can look past the ridiculousness of the setup, it's a good movie. A darn good movie, really. Milius, most famous for being the screenwriter for Apocalypse Now and the director of Conan the Barbarian, may not be the best director who ever lived, but he is a good one. If the film were nothing but reactionary propaganda, it wouldn't be remembered quite as well today. Shows like South Park and Family Guy couldn't do take-offs on particular scenes if it had been a forgettable movie. The story is quite gripping, and the characters are fairly well written and performed by an excellent young cast (among them Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson, and C. Thomas Howell). I do think there might have been a bit more of a relationship between the kids. Some of the film's strongest sequences have to do with the moral questions they ask themselves, and the fights they have with each other. If we knew a bit more about the characters, it might be stronger there.",Red Dawn

It's a great concept, of what if a Soviet invasion of mid-america happens.  The cultural differences between the 2 communists and middle America, or the heartland.  Its nice to watch Jed's character,  represnet the heartland, and how hard of a time it would be to take over a country where there is gun in every household, and alot of ex military, bushmen type of people around.  You would have about as hard of a time pacifying America as the British did.

19,SimonJack,"Very good ""What-if ?"" action/war flick during the Cold War",9,17 September 2014,"When ""Red Dawn"" came out in 1984, the American public was wary of going to war. The end of the Vietnam War a decade earlier still resonated as a big loss for the U.S. Communists had been succeeding in capturing states in other areas around the globe. The Soviet Union had equaled or surpassed the U.S. in its nuclear arsenal. It showed no signs of weakness yet. The Soviets were aiding insurrections in Nicaragua and elsewhere, as they had supported North Vietnam. The red menace was very real. Just two years earlier, Great Britain had gone to war with Argentina after that South American country invaded the Falkland Islands on April 2, 1982. No foreign army had ever attacked or taken an inch of American soil since the War of 1812. Was it possible that it could happen now? Might another country or coalition of nations now be strong enough to attack the U.S.? The stage was set; and so the time was ripe for a film such as ""Red Dawn.""Others have discussed the story, acting and other details of the movie. Liberal critics panned the film. Those caught up in a growing wave of young patriotism liked it. Most people, in neither camp, enjoyed it for what it was. And ""Red Dawn"" didn't disappoint as a film about survival and fighting off an invading force. With its cast of mostly young up and coming actors, ""Red Dawn"" was the number 10 film in U.S. box office gross for 1984. It had one of the best returns for budget for the year. Its budget was $4.2 million and it grossed $38.4 million in the U.S. Although he is a libertarian in many aspects, director/writer John Milius is hawkish on war, military, and terrorism. He had a penchant for realism and accuracy. So, some of the best work for this film was in the recreation of Russian tanks, other vehicles and armament. The young cast went through eight weeks of training to learn about military tactics, and to learn to fire and break down the various weapons. Former Army Captain Dale Dye of Warriors Inc. was military adviser for the film, and designed the basic training program for the cast. Young people today may dismiss the Cold War (1947-1991) as nothing more than a time of political tension and verbal jousting among the world's super powers. But those who study history will learn of the real threats and dangers that lurked during that time. And of the genuine worry about possible war in the public arena, especially, in the U.S. Those who lived during the Cold War period can recall events that raised the specter of a possible third world war at any time. I recall the air- raid drills in the 1950s grade school when we would scramble to get under our desks. It's OK to laugh about it today, but the public specter of someone accidentally pushing a button that would start World War III was very real. ""Red Dawn"" was a very good film that gave us an action-packed and thoughtful look at a what-if scenario following an invasion of the U.S. In that regard, it was highly successful and entertaining. This film was in the days before computer-generated imagery. It shows how much more realistic movies appear when authentic equipment or replicas are built and used for films. This film is an excellent example. It's one of the last films to use extensive recreations of authentic weapons and war machines. The film was shot mainly in the Arapaho National Forest of Colorado, and in and around the town of Las Vegas (population about 15,000), New Mexico. Bonus video clips with the DVD of the film have interviews with actors, directors and technical folks. The bonus items give good information on the replicas, special effects work, and shooting locations. It's still a good film to watch these many years later.",Red Dawn
20,Mr-Fusion,"Extremely uneven, but memorable",6,15 September 2014,"Regardless of where you fall on ""Red Dawn"", it's definitely left its mark. As soon as you hear someone yell ""Wolverines!"", you instantly get the reference. Personally, I love the movie's right-wing politics. The opening - superbly paced - plays like a 2nd Amendment fantasy and the paranoia is pervasive. It's a blast, and to be honest, this is the film's best feature. The problem I've always had with this is that it tries to have it both ways. Once the Wolverines start to hold their ground, the demoralizing effects kick in, and all the fun's taken right out. It's kinda funny that way; the real cheese is found when the movie goes anti-war. That said, this is a terrific snapshot of young Hollywood, and the locations are perfect for the fabled heartland America.I just wish the movie could've stayed the course with its macho conservatism. Although I still think that one-sheet is some of the most effective movie marketing in history.6/10",Red Dawn
21,StevePulaski,I guess you're better dead than red,5,24 November 2012,"I consider watching ""dated"" films not a chore but an experience and an opportunity to view the world as it once was. They are time capsules, much in the way old Polaroids capture the exact spirit of the moment they were taken , and go on to have a life of their own, much like ""dated"" films do. But that doesn't mean they're always a very memorable or pleasant experience.John Milius' Red Dawn captures that time of paranoia and uncertainty when the Soviet Union was rapidly growing in power and the U.S. had ""red fever,"" as they anticipated some sort of attack from the communist country and began persecuting those who held beliefs mirroring those of communism. Watching the film in 2012, when the ""red scare"" is long over and communism seems to be one of the more minor concerns in America, the 1984 cult hit serves little purpose, other than to just be a curious piece of history and the film that kick-started Charlie Sheen's career.Our story is set in Calumet, Colorado, where we open by seeing a history teacher instructing his class when Russian paratroopers land in the open plain behind the school and begin opening fire on the building. The students frantically escape after their teacher is killed, and several band together to head up to a local grocer to gather supplies. The leader is Jed Eckhert (Patrick Swayze), who very early establishes his dominance among the group of teens mainly because of his assertiveness and his grand ability to be brave and stable. His brother is the quiet yet more emotionally open Matt (Charlie Sheen), their close friend is the very emotional Robert (C. Thomas Howell), and one of the girls they meet along the way is Erica Mason (Lea Thompson), who shows that she is not your typical female hero. Together, they form a group called the ""Wolverines,"" after their school football team, as they gather heavy artillery, weaponry, and food in efforts to stop the invasion of their country.I'm writing this review shortly after writing my review of the 2012 remake of Red Dawn and all I see myself doing from this moment on is reiterating the same complaints I had after seeing the facile, bland remake, meaning that film failed at its first immediate goal, which is to improve on the original. Thankfully, to get us through this long endeavor unharmed and somewhat moved, is a charismatic cast comprised of the easygoing charmer Swayze, one of the best ""that guy"" actors, C. Thomas Howell, the unpredictable Charlie Sheen, and the rough and tumble Powers Boothe as the Wolverines' main asset.Unfortunately, even this cast of champs can't stop Red Dawn's main problem, which is a cheap, underwritten script that shortchanges the characters in favor of action sequences and scenes of just plain uncertainty. It capitalizes on the idea that in 1984, people were fearful of the Soviets and their power and pretty much sat on the idea that people in the audience were thinking, ""my god, this could really happen!"" It wasn't until the Soviet regime fell through in the early 1990's did we look back at this film as nothing more than a nationalist, pro-America propaganda with goofy characters, a silly story, and unrealistic action.The film's prominent gimmick is an interesting one; war from the perspective not of controlling adults, but impressionable teenagers who had a normal day of class interrupted thanks to violence and a surprise invasion. This is one of those rare, on-the-dime ideas that could carry an entire film, but writers Milius and Kevin Reynolds prefer the easy way out, centering the storyline not on the characters but on the action around the characters which makes Red Dawn feel longer than it actually is. Having it rely entirely on the idea of a Soviet invasion only made its ""dated"" feel become more and more evident.NOTE: Visit my blog to see an analysis of both Red Dawn films to see which one I feel is the better film, http://stevepulaski.blogspot.comStarring: Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Powers Boothe. Directed by: John Milius.",Red Dawn
22,Rainey-Dawn,Old Enough To Remember,9,23 June 2014,"Red Dawn came out when I was 12 years of age... the movie sent chills down my spine. I recall hearing some of the adults speak of the Cold War and Russia in general. I recall some of the people being terrified that something like the movie Red Dawn could happen. To this day, I still think of this movie when I think of a war (an invasion) on American soil.Maybe you would have to be older to get this film entirely... or read about the Cold War to get full understanding and the chilling effect of what this film is about.I have yet to watch the re-make of Red Dawn, I hear they changed the country to North Korea. I'm not so sure the re-make would be all that good because I am old enough to recall the fears of the Cold War that spawned the original movie. But I cannot make a full judgement on how I feel about it (the re-make) until I see it.This is a very good film - well worth watching.I have to give the original Red Dawn 9.5/10",Red Dawn
23,lost-in-limbo,"""Boys avenge me! Avenge me!""",7,5 August 2011,"It might be pure fantasy, but this dangerously paranoid cold war drama ""Red Dawn"" with its outlandish, but ambitious premise truly shows that with heartache can come glory. No matter what side you find yourself on. Its vision is a powerful, disturbing one and seen through the eyes of the children and it's their flag waving story that the magnifying glass follows. From them fleeing in fear, to discovering the whereabouts of loved ones and eventually taking one's life. They're emotionally tested in what is an inspiring coming of age through harrowing extremities and heroic exploits. A small ragtag of teens flee to the Colorado mountains after their town was invaded by Soviet Union soldiers. There at first they simply try to survive in the wilderness, but they learn its WW3 with loved ones being executed and so they go about guerrilla warfare under the name ""Wolverines"". With a young up and coming cast like this, you could tell this was aimed for a teenage audience. Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell and Lea Thompson. They're quite good in their spiritedly raw deliveries (especially watching the cold-hearted transformation of Howell's character) and forming as one by taking the war back to the Russians, but they're balanced out by the seniors. Ben Johnson and Harry Dean Stanton have tiny parts. Powers Boothe simply commands the screen as an American jet pilot. Playing the Russians with plenty of vigour are Ron O'Neal and William Smith whose ruthless character is brought in to hunt down the ""Wolverines"". O'Neal's performance is a hearty one, as his character's mindset shares everyone's feeling by the end. Here the Russians actually speak Russian with the subtitles being used. Director / co-writer John Milius conventionally focused styling is packed with tactically precise action and lean dramatics favouring pulpy propaganda. The opening scenes of the invasion where the Russians parachute in to this small community is filled with memorable imagery. From then onwards we're thrown right in to the comic-book excitement and rarely does it let up on its upbeat tempo despite the overlong nature. The script's concentration is only on this small community behind enemy lines, despite America being under attack. Our information of this comes from Boothe's character. The mountainous terrain while picturesque is desolate and unforgiving. Sensationalized B-material given quality treatment.""All the hate is going to burn you up kid"".",Red Dawn

With the country under a permanent state of siege, it falls on a group of high-school students to fight back and save the day.The film opens with no build-up or character development, and we are just thrust head-first into Red Dawn's utterly banal, ridiculous plot in which high-schoolers are left to take on the Russian military, without seemingly any help from the Air Force, National Guard or police (and where did they get so learned in the art of kicking Russian ass, anyway?) On the cornier side of the coin, we have to contend with Patrick Swayze (with full on Jim Davidson facial glare) and Charlie Sheen as brothers with a huge age gap between them, as well as forced crying scenes from Swayze (see why he never worked much in the 90s?) Speaking of which, director John Milius never prospered very far either, only going on to make iffy looking TV films as opposed to working in Hollywood again.And then there's the film's ridiculous length. It's about twenty minutes (if not thirty minutes!) too long, making it even more boring than it already is. Even on a cheesy level, the film is simply no fun at all. Avoid. *",Red Dawn
25,g-bodyl,Great Film!,9,9 November 2010,"Red Dawn is a pretty good film that could have been very real in the mid 1980's. I say real because it could have been possible for the Soviets and the Cubans to invade our country. This movie has plenty of great action scenes and ones with intense drama.This movie is basically about the start of World War Three. The beginning scene is one of the most shocking of all time. A bunch paratroopers land on the school property and start shooting at people.The acting is pretty good. The brothers were played by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen. They were pretty good.The special effects did not look that great. They looked cheesy even for the 80's.Overall, this is a great action film that everyone should like. Hopefully, the remake comes out soon. I rate this film 9/10.",Red Dawn

All the characters are decent, and the story is watchable enough, plus it was amusing for me to see Swayze and Charlie Sheen so young in this film!. This really could have been a very powerful film, however, I couldn't find myself rooting for any of the Wolverine's, and the performances were rather wooden, however the setting gave me the chills!. The ending was really good though, and it had some pretty good war action scenes, however the dialog was pretty shoddy. It's quite graphic in some scenes, and C. Thomas Howell, while wasn't as bad as people said, still wasn't all that great either, plus Charlie Sheen was kind of wasted, and didn't have all that much to do, as this is mostly Swayze's film all the way. It's not very enjoyable to watch, and while Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey were nice to look at, they were also kind of wasted, however I dug the opening. This is an OK teen war film, that had a few powerful moments, but it left me feeling rather cold and the performances could have been better, worth the the watch. The Direction is decent. John Milius does a decent job here with good camera work, using a great setting, and keeping the film at a watchable pace. The Acting is OK. Patrick Swayze is good for the most part, however there were a few moments where he didn't convince me,and I didn't agree with a lot of his actions, still I dig the guy as an actor as he did a pretty good job for the most part. C. Thomas Howell overacted pretty bad here, but still wasn't as bad as many say, I didn't care for his character either, he was OK. Charlie Sheen is not his usual amazing self as he is pretty bad here as well, he had barely anything to do, and didn't speak all that much either(Charlie Rules!!!!). Lea Thompson is very cute, and did what she had to do adequately, it's too bad because she is a great underrated actress. Jennifer Grey is also cute, but had barely anything to do as well, she was alright. Harry Dean Stanton did good in his scene. Powers Boothe is also good in his role and brought his usual intensity. Brad Savage(Danny),Darren Dalton(Daryl Bates),Ben Johnson(Mr. Mason) all do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast are OK. Overall worth the watch. **1/2 out of 5",Red Dawn
27,The-Sarkologist,One Man's Freedom Fighter is Another Man's Terrorist,4,28 December 2012,"I did really like this film a while ago until I read a review on the remake (which I have yet to see, and will probably wait until it is released on video) where the writer was disgusted at the fact that a movie is made where during an invasion of the United States (by North Korea of all countries) a group of Americans launch insurgent attacks against the invading army. I guess this is where the concept of one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist.Back in 1984 when this film was made the whole idea of an insurgent being classed as a terrorist was not a big thing probably because the United States were not an occupying force in any country, however, twenty-five years later we have had two wars of aggression where the perils of being an occupying army have come to the fore. Okay, granted, here in Australia, attacks against occupying troops in Iraq and Afghanistan (as well as such attacks against troops in Somalia back in the early nineties) are not described as terrorist attacks but rather as insurgent attacks.Unfortunately I cannot compare the two movies, but I notice that in this one the occupying army is portrayed as being monstrous, but there again we see how our group of insurgents also fall down the slippery slope of monstrousness as well. It begins when one of them is encouraged to drink the blood of a deer after his first kill, and ends with them executing a prisoner and a traitor in cold blood. However, we do note that the invading force are portrayed as being less than ethical, particularly with the idea that for every one soldier that is killed, twelve civilians are executed.The idea of freedom comes to the fore in this film by comparing what it would be like under an occupying regime as compared to life in the American heartland, however while ones movements are controlled in occupied America (not that the Iraqis had such freedom because their freedoms were also curtailed considerably under the occupying regime) in free America there is still the fact that the only freedom that you have is that which you can purchase. If you have money then you have freedom however if you don't have money then you might as well live in a dictatorship because your choice is really only determined by what you can purchase.However, it is not like the Americans are any better than these imaginary enemies, okay, they may not have responded with indiscriminate killings whenever one of their own were killed (though it did happen) but there were incidents such as Abu-Graib, despite the media cover-up that it was only a few bad apples. Then there is the fact that prisoners were labeled enemy combatants so as to remove their rights given out by the Geneva Convention, and to add further insult to injury, the United States refuses to ratify the international criminal court, thus preventing any of their citizens from coming under that jurisdiction.The final thing that I must mention is the mentality in the film that the warrior must not cry. To me that is absolute rubbish and that is another means of destroying the humanity within you. We live in a culture where mean are not meant to cry because that is seen as a sign of emotional weakness. There have been books written about how such attitudes have served to undermine a soldier's humanity by denying him the basic right to grieve for the loss of a friend and comrade. However, in the end, if there is something that I would compare this movie to then it would be Lord of the Flies.",Red Dawn
28,paulclaassen,I cared very little for any of the characters...,3,7 November 2018,"Within minutes, the film plunges you smack bang in the middle of the action. Although not entirely believable, the action is good, which is more than I can say for the acting, the dialogue, characters or plot.It was fun to see, I suppose, how the group of youngsters started off attacking three soldiers, then gained confidence, experience and weapons, and eventually took down an entire army base. The film, however, failed to capture my attention. I didn't really care for any of the characters. The music was annoyingly sentimental at times and over-dramatic otherwise. The film-making is so patriotically American, as is the story. Jed (Patrick Swayze) was not a very likable character and neither were anyone else for that matter.The events that unfolded often gave me a sense of deja vu to the point where I either wanted the war to end, or the soldiers to take out all the youngsters. I just really didn't care.The 2010 Australian film 'Tomorrow, when the war began' had a very similar theme, but was head and shoulders above this film.",Red Dawn
29,digitalbeachbum,This needed a better script,5,12 September 2021,"The idea behind this is nothing new. The invasion of Russians on American soil has been a concern for over seventy years. However, this makes it seem like several communist C. American countries along with Cuba attack us through Mexico. It will never happen, in any Universe. The idea of Russians being led by Spanish military leaders is another illogical thought.The comparison with between the Vietnam War and this war is not executed well, and I find the scenes in the town with the flag waving and marching a parade of review silly.The casting is fine. The list is all A grade actors from a variety of genres. Many who later became even more well known and successful. Several old timer actors give good supporting roles. The list is also long.I like how several of the actors were showing signs of exposure. You can actually see some of their skin cracking from the cold and they have snow burn. That must have been some intense filming. The cinematography is good also, the director makes use of the amazing mountains and the open plains.The movie doesn't hold up overtime.

31,JohnSeal,Dreadful but remarkably prescient,2,4 February 2006,"Director John Milius couldn't have imagined (or intended) that his magnum opus Red Dawn would be one of the most politically prescient films of the 1980s, but indeed it is. When a peace loving country is invaded by a distant enemy and finds its people murdered, raped, and humiliated by foreigners who can't even speak the language, it's incumbent upon the remaining citizenry (Patrick Swaye, C. Thomas Howell and others) to rise up and fight a guerrilla war against their oppressors. That resistance can take many forms, including, according to Milius' film, the use of IEDs such as the one insinuated into a tank by a girl on a bicycle and the use of hand held SAMs to shoot down helicopters. As the insurgents gain knowledge of the invaders' tactics and acquire advanced weaponry, they are better able to take the fight to the enemy by any means necessary. As a film, Red Dawn is predictable and badly written (only the presence of Powers Boothe elevates it from a '1' to a '2'), but as an educational essay on the rights and responsibilities of colonised peoples to stand up to imperial invaders, it's second only to Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers.",Red Dawn
32,Captain_Couth,"Revenge of the 80's: The Red Scare, brat pack style!",8,22 April 2004,"Red Dawn (1984) was one of the first movies to be labeled by the M.P.A.A. with the honorary P.G.-13 tag (I highly doubt this movie would get one today). John Milius' film not only reflects his paranoid vision of a future America but it also is a result of 80's Reganism and heavy handed flag waving patriotism. Beside the obvious right-wing leanings of the film-maker I actually enjoyed this movie. It always has been and it'll always will be one of my personnel favorites.Red Dawn takes place in the near future. The globe has been swept with drastic changes and America's enemies are at the gates waiting to tear it down. World War III was launched without the aid of nuclear weapons, it's pretty much a conventional conflict. A downsized military has been unable to deal with the communist horde and parts of America are under siege. One such battleground takes place in a small mid-western town.Brothers Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze along with their friends (C. Thomas Howell among them) flee into the hills when Soviet special forces invade their school and lay waste to most of the faculty and students. The students flee into the hills (with the aid of C. Thomas Howell's father) and that's when the fun really begins.Many of your typical 80's stars have parts in this film (Jennifer Gray, Lea Thompson) as well as several old veterans (Ron O' Neal, William Smith, Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton). I have seen stills of a scene where the boys wander into a Mc Donald's that's populated with Soviet Soldiers (Was this cut out because of that Mc Donald's massacre that occurred in the early 80's) some of that scene can be seen on the trailer that accompanies the D.V.D. As you can tell, Red Dawn is one of my favorite flicks.Highly recommended.""Boys! Avenge me! Avenge",Red Dawn
33,freemantle_uk,Wolverines,6,14 January 2010,"Red Dawn to many has become a cult classic, being reference in popular culture like Scrubs and South Park. It was a film made at the high of Ronald Regan's powers, where the Soviet Union was seen as pure evil and very right wing films were being made, such as Uncommon Valour, the Rambo sequels and Commando. It is a product of it's time, over the action, cheesy action.Red Dawn takes place in world where NATO has collapsed and Communism has spread in Latin America, including Mexico. The Soviets and Cubans launch a surprise invasion of the United States, with a impressive scene involving paratroopers. In one town in Colorado a group of teenagers run away to the forest. Two brothers Jed (Patrick Swayze) and Matt (Charlie Sheen) lead the group and uses survival skills to live and avoid the fighting. When their return to the town they find out that the Soviets are after them and their parents have been sent to re-education camps. The teens decide to fight back. They capture Soviet weapons and start a guerrilla campaign of raids and bombings. This makes the Communist forces very nervous and end up taking reprisals out on civilians. But the teens, known as the Wolverines, offer hope for American resistance.The action is fun and OTT. This is not a gritty war film. It is about how many commies can be killed. If you want to enjoy this film you have to put the right wing ideology aside. This is a film that is pro-gun rights/private gun ownership, and that anyone communism is evil. A good example of this is the Communism troops shoot teachers and students at a school, and that Soviet troops try to rape teenage girls. It also has a questionable morality about the willingness of people to turn not only into resistance fighters, but also cold-blooded killers.They are problems with the films. As mentions there is it's political ideology, but the main problem is the actor. Most of it is weak, which is a same because Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen did end up doing better films. There is also little character development and one-dimensional characterisation: Americans good, Soviets evil. The most interesting character in the film was Colonel Bella (Ron O'Neal), a Cuban officer and former resistances fighter who does not like the extreme Soviet tactics and wants to take a more conservative approach. The film does try to touch issues of war morality, but not very hard.The film takes itself too seriously. It could have been more tongue-in-cheek in nature, or if it really wanted to make a serious film, the make up of the Wolverines should have been more balanced, not just teenagers. There are also some logical issues, like where didn't more people get recruited into the Wolverines, or why wasn't the Re-Education camp more well guarded when the teens go to see their day.Overall, an okay film, which you only need to see once.",Red Dawn

36,drystyx,throwback to old war movies,7,15 May 2007,"This is a throwback to old war movies with some political commentary thrown in. It would seem the rhetoric here is right wing Republican. However, their propaganda is extremely well done and entertaining, focusing on very interesting characters. The Southwestern U.S.A. is invaded by Soviets and their allies, some of whom are conquered foes. After some initial carnage (which some will remember spoofed in an episode of South Park), eight teenagers go out on their own in the wilderness. They are led by the jock, Patrick Swayze, although the rich kid tries to assume control. Swayze has two loyal followers in his brother (Charlie Sheen) and a young man whose father was murdered by the invaders, who becomes the most aggressive of the group. They are joined by a downed American pilot, (Powers Booth), who gives insight into the plot. The story is very touching, and you care about the characters, which makes you forget the heavyhanded political commentary. The execution scene is the most touching since THE 49TH PARALLEL. A lot of character exposes are very good among the minor characters. For instance, three of the invaders are touring the wilderness when they happen upon Swayze and his group. Their banter gives a very authentic impression. Some of the banter between the youngsters, too, looks very credible. One flaw is that the three major leaders of the invasion force look stereotypical in comparison to the clever character development of the others in the film. In fact, most of the adults seem one dimensional in relation to the younger characters. A minor flaw in a very entertaining and emotional movie that probably shouldn't be taken seriously on a political level, but perhaps so on the individual and emotional level.",Red Dawn
37,dworldeater,Great,9,25 April 2020,"Red Dawn would get a lot of flack for it's right wing themes, but unlike a lot of other movies made around this time, this can be taken seriously and was done really well. In the Reagan Era, The Cold War was in full swing and the possibility of war with the Soviet Union was a grim reality. While the idea of The United States getting invaded by anyone with any degree of success is a right wing fantasy. But Red Dawn presents the scenerio in the most realistic way possible and shows what may happen if The US got invaded by Cuban and Soviet forces. Much of what happens with teenagers engaging in guerrilla warfare is a reality (especially in 3rd world countries). This movie takes that idea and twists it to fit the narrative and it works. Whether or not you agree with John Milius's politics is irrelevant as he was easily one of the most talented filmmakers of his time, writing and directing classes like this and Conan The Barbarian and working on script writing for Apocalypse Now and lots of other projects, this is a guy who knows how to tell a story. The youthful ensemble cast did an excellent job and became some of the biggest names in Hollywood. Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen all got their start here. The cast is filled with talented old school actors as well with William Smith, Ben Johnson, Ron O'Neal and Harry Dean Stanton. While feeling very much 80's, it has a legit war film feel to it. With the southwestern landscape it has a hint of the rugged old school western as well. Red Dawn delivers with a lot of action, but the dramatic scenes are also done well enough for audiences to care about the characters and invest in the story. If you compare this to something like Iron Eagle or a number of cheesy rip offs like Invasion USA, Red Dawn has aged really well and is an excellent film.",Red Dawn

Demonstrating just how ignorant the US mainstream media was and indeed, still is, in this respect, based on recent events.On the upside, its funny as hell. The cheesy one liners, folksy US set pieces and nods to a outback Western tradition that was, in reality, little more than fiction, come thick and fast. ""Extra thick"" as it happens.You get to see some well known entertainment faces too when they were little more than fresh faced youths.Go on, you know you want to.6/10 from me.",Red Dawn
39,Enchorde,Classic war movie,7,30 January 2010,"Recap: A fateful morning Soviet paratroops, along with Cuban and Nicaraguan allies, invade USA. NATO has fallen apart and USA stands alone. A few high school kids flee to the mountains when the invasion hits, and upon seeing the maltreatment their families and friends in their town get, they decide to fight back. It starts almost accidentally, with a few soldiers that just happen upon them. But as they equip themselves with their victims weapons they get more and more ambitious. They attack both whole platoons and the Soviet base. But as they get more and more troublesome for the invading army, the pressure on them rises. The Soviets send more and more troops after them and the group suffers both from lack of food and shelter.Comments: A violent classic with some (to be) prominent stars in leading roles. Patrick Swayze plays Jed the leader, and Charlie Sheen is making his screen debut as Jed's brother. The cast also includes, among others, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton and Lane Smith.In all it is a pretty good action and war movie. It does manage to keep its balance, that the action scenes seem pretty accurate and thought through. It is only a few times they go over the top and turn to over-violence, I'm especially thinking of the beginning, the invasion, and I had my doubts then. But then they settled down to a better and more plausible level. To their credit is that they don't overdo the explosions, and doesn't rely on special effects to thrill. It is the story that drives this movie, only augmented and emphasized by the violence, not the other way around.It shows sometimes that is made in 1984, more than 25 years ago, but since the movie does rely more on hardware and story than special effects that doesn't disturb very much. It also helps that much of the story is set in the national park, in the wilderness, and it doesn't show much of buildings, vehicles or clothing (the kids use military gear mostly) that could give away its age.I can understand why it is considered to be a classic. It is well done and very entertaining, definitely recommended. Apparently there are remake coming, it should be interesting to see how they handled it but I doubt it will be better than the original.7/10",Red Dawn
40,Agent10,The best cheesy teen/war movie of all time!,7,30 July 2002,"Altered reality was never more cool in this film about kids fighting off the perils of a Russian invasion. While one just focuses on the campy nature of the film, the dark undertone to the film was quite startling. Breed your kids to hate an enemy they have no idea why they should hate in the first place. With some of the good young stars of the time, this film was one of those 80s teen films I can actually stand to watch on a regular basis. While this is not better than Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, at least it didn't follow some clichéd formula and dared to be different.",Red Dawn
41,a_chinn,The commies are coming! The commies are coming!,10,14 July 2018,"This is one of my desert island films, meaning what 10 films would you take with you if you were trapped on a deserted island, which is asking what are the 10 greatest films of all-time, but what 10 films would you most enjoy watching over and over again? John Milius' ""Red Dawn"" is unquestionably amongst of my ten films. The continental US is invaded by the USSR and an ordinary group of high schoolers find themselves hiding out in the hills from the dirty commies and wage a guerrilla war against the occupying Soviet and Cuban forces. The group adopts their high school mascot, the Wolverines, as their rallying cry, and are led by former football star Patrick Swayze, along with his brother Charlie Sheen, in his film debut, Lea Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, and Jennifer Grey. The story is an irresistible Cold War era set-up, but it's really writer/director Milus' execution of that story that make this film a classic. The recent remake got just about everything wrong and Mlius hits everything just right. The film sees the teens making the leap from a group of typical kids to a group of freedom fighters, versus the remake where they were a fighting force pretty much from the start. Milius also pushes the Americana elements, which make an incursion by the Russians all the more offensive and angering for the audience, not the least of which is casting iconic western actor Ben Johnson in a supporting role. Most significantly, Milius dials the jingoism up to eleven and that's where this film stands out and really comes to life. All of the American iconography throughout the film is one thing, but when you have an NRA bumper sticker brought to life with a Russian taking a gun out of someones cold dead hand or Patrick Swayze arguing with his brother whether their violent tactics are any different from their enemy, Swayze shouts, ""Because ... we live here!"" Which brings up the interesting political implications of this film. The Soviets are clearly the bad guys for their unprovoked invasion of the United States, but it's impossible to watch ""Red Dawn"" without seeing a connection to US occupation and fighting of various ""insurgent groups"" in the Middle East. The same reasons you feel sympathies for Swayze and his fellow Wolverines for protecting their own because they ""live here,"" it's not hard to see why the insurgency in the Middle East continues nearly 20 years after the initial US invasion of Afghanistan. Well, there are differences in the situations for sure, but regardless, but on a simple human emotional level you can't help but watch ""Red Dawn"" and on that gut level see the universal human desire to protect your homeland from outsiders. But I digress. As I was saying before, it's the film's unabashed flag waving that make it such a camp classic and something that stands apart from the remake or any other similar alternate history type of films. Americans citizens are rounded up in put in re-education camps. Prisoners are lined up for a firing squad and singing ""America the Beautiful"" as a final act of patriotic defiance. The film is littered with these type of gonzo moments, which are over-the-top and jingoistic to the point of absurdity (though I'll admit to getting quite caught up in it and quite enjoying it), but it's really the small bits of American iconography throughout the film that give it it's power; the game day football field, the middle America small town, the Teddy Roosevelt statue, Swayze's old west Colt 45, or the Wolverines riding on horseback, all add up to a very ""American"" band of heroes using what makes America great to preserve and protect those icons. I also need to mention that ""Red Dawn"" contains my favorite one-scene performance of all time. This is when an actor only appears in one scene in a movie, but gives a startlingly great and memorable performance that impacts the larger film. Examples of this would be Christopher Walker's gold watch scene in ""Pulp Fiction"" or Henry Jones' devastating inquest scene in ""Vertigo."" In ""Red Dawn"" there is one scene where brothers Swayze and Sheen to go a drive-in that's been converted into a POW/re-education camp and are looking for their father, played by legendary and iconoclastic actor Harry Dean Stanton, and the following exchange happens with the characters separated by chainlink fencing:Tom: Boys.
Matt: Daddy. Dad.
Tom: Don't talk. Don't say anything. Let me look at ya. I knew I was right. I knew it. You're alive. I was tough on both of you. I did things that made you, made you hate me sometimes. You understand now, don't you?
Jed: What happened, dad? Why are you here? What'd you do?
Tom: Doesn't matter. One way or another, for one reason or another, we're all gone. It's all gone. Remember. Remember when you used to go in the park and play, and I used to put you two on the swings? Both of you were so damn little.
Jed: I remember. I remember all of it.
Tom: Well, I won't be there to pick you up when you fall now. Both of you have to take care of each other now.
Matt: We'll never see you again, dad.
Tom: Yes you will. I don't want to hear that, Maddy. 
Matt: What happened to mom, dad? Where is she?
Tom: You can't afford to be crying anymore now. I don't want either one of you to ever cry for me again. Don't ever do it. Not as long as you live.
Robert: Where's my dad, Mr. Eckert?
Tom: I don't know son. I don't know. You all get going. Get out before they find you.
Jed: Dad, I love you.
Tom: I know you do, son. I love you too.Tom, Jed, and Robert LeaveTom: Boys! Avenge Me! Avenge Me!You know that scene in ""Dirty Harry"" where Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan describes the power of the .44 Magnum? John Milius wrote that. Remember the scene in ""Jaws"" when Robert Shaw, playing Quint the shark hunter, talks about his buddies being eaten alive by sharks during World War II? That was Milius. How about the line in ""Apocalypse Now,"" when Robert Duvall, playing a surf-loving Army colonel, says, ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning""? Milius again. This is why I love Milius and consider him one of the greatest Hollywood screenwriters. This particular scene stands right alongside Milus' most famous contributions to the silver screen. Stanton makes such a strong impression with this one scene that between his performance and Milius' dialogue, the brothers entire childhood and formulation of their character and who they are is encapsulated is this once moment. The scene gives me chills every time. And as corny as Stanton yelling ""Avenge Me!"" at the end is, it works within the context of this film. Besides the great Harry Dean Stanton, Milius also cast Ron ""Superfly"" O'Neal, Frank McRae, Lane Smith, and the vastly underrated Powers Boothe, along with my all-time favorite character actor, William Smith (who also played Conan's dad in Milius' ""Conan the Barbarian""), as commander Strelnikov, and interestingly, Smith was not just speaking his Russian dialogue from rote memory, but he is actually fluent in several Russian dialects and European languages. During the Korean War, Smith was actually recruited by the CIA and NSA during his time in the Air Force and worked as a Russian Intercept Interrogator. Also worth noting is the excellent score by Basil Poledouris, who also worked with Milius on his classic score for ""Conan the Barbarian."" Overall, sure ""Red Dawn"" is a right-wing paranoid fantasy, but is an incredibly fun one and is storytelling of the first order. FUN FACT! This was the first film to be released in the US with a PG-13 rating. Also, the military operation to capture Saddam Hussein was named Operation Red Dawn and its targets were dubbed Wolverine 1 and Wolverine 2.",Red Dawn
42,vertigo_14,All Aboard the Pain Train.,1,8 March 2004,"I would likely consider this one of the worst, if not the worst ever movies that I have ever watched. The premise and all it's supporting occurrences is almost nearly as ridiculous and impractical as the woodsy headhunter murderers in the Corey Feldman/Meredith Salinger movie, Edge of Honor (a movie quite similar to this, minus about twelve kids).Here, we have the invasion of Russians in a small American town. The plot is forgiveable and expectable given that it was obviously made during the cold war. But here, a bunch of dumb high school kids ban together to fight off this relentless army of Russians. And they're so cavalier about it like somehow preperation on the football field had prepared them for this day of battle. And there's really no point, other than being nauseatingly super-patriotic (and in this day and age, that's an attitude I can very much do without). A bunch of 80s teen superstars, many of which looked like their kids were in high school, were placed in this star vehicle that had zip story. And it just goes on like that for a little less than two hours. It was the biggest hambone I've ever seen. And I hope never to see it again.

44,winner55,laughter and puke,1,4 June 2007,"I saw this only once, and couldn't finish it. The script was so bad, it would have been a laugh riot, if it weren't so disgustingly paranoid to the point of nausea. When America invaded Iraq, American television stations owned by Australian media king Rupert Murdoch, such as the Fox network, began broadcasting this film and announcing it as a ""classic"". Apparently not only political history but film history are to be completely re-written by the Far Right - effectively adopting old Soviet tactics that the Right once vilified as the denial of freedom of thought. In fact, George W. Bush himself would have made a wonderful Stalinist if he had been born in Soviet Russia - but hey, why let ethnicity get in the way, he IS a great Stalinist, he just doesn't speak Russian (or very good American for that matter).Milius started out his film career rather well, doing pick-up work for the likes of Sam Peckinpah, before directing excellent historical action films, e.g., ""Dillinger"" and ""The Wind and the Lion"". Then he got hired for the weird (and undeniably racist) ""Conan the Barbarian"", and everything about him just turned sick. Drugs?, Money? True colors showing forth? Only his psychiatrist knows for sure.I""m going to include here a part of my review of a recent video game inspired by ""Red Dawn"", ""Freedom Fighters"", because it was playing this game that made me think of this movie:""The Soviets could never have invaded America, nor would they unless the US tried to invade them first. The Soviets were too isolationist, and their leaders didn't trust each other enough to launch such an invasion, which would have strained their always unstable inner political structure (and their economy). If they had invaded, American reaction would have been swift and devastatingly violent, whether the US were led by Democrats - like Jimmy Carter, who, long before he entered politics, effectively designed the US nuclear submarine program, targeted specifically at the Soviet Union - or Republicans like Reagan. Despite right-wing rhetoric, wars are not about flags (what the Amish call ""painted rags"") or (cities). In 1812, Napoleon thought he had captured Russia because he had captured Moscow; the Russians let him know different. 42 years later, the Confederate Army fought Union General Sherman to preserve Atlanta Georgia, because they thought he wanted to use the railway network that joined at Atlanta as a base; so he had the whole city burned down just to prove he didn't care about their dam' railroad. The kids who think stories (about a Soviet invasion of America) make sense, haven't any notion what freedom really means, and so would never know how to fight for it. You don't start by willing to kill - but by willing to die. To die, because ""freedom"" is only a codeword for ""the next generation"" - that is, our children and our children's children, and the kind of life we wish for them to enjoy. If this ""kind of life"" is all about money and consumer goods, then it amounts to nothing. It is the ability to think for one's self and to define the self that thinks. It is the choice of morals, which admittedly deny us much of the grosser enjoyments in life, not a choice of objects to enjoy.""The most serious problem with the American Right and its paranoid propaganda is that it doesn't offer any of its followers anything worth dying for, any value worth preserving across generations.Bushies have been tossing the word ""freedom"" about as though speaking the word were an inevitable result of breathing; but they have yet to explain what freedoms they believe Bush to be defending - since he repeatedly violates the Bill of Rights, the Constitutional foundation of American freedom - and since Bush has made it quite clear he never intended the Iraqis to decide their own government for themselves. So - ""freedom""? - to do what? to what end?""Red Dawn"" suffers the same miserable absence of values. Since the film's Soviets don't seem to be invading for any discernible political reason, the teenagers fighting them don't seem to have any political reason for doing this either.But that is a fundamental intent of all Right-wing propaganda: to scare people into killing others without giving them time to wonder why.And, unfortunately, there are plenty of people who prefer not to think for themselves.So if you want to ""get stupid"" for a couple hours, go ahead and watch this film. otherwise, read a good book - like ""Red Badge of Courage"" or ""Leaves of Grass""; or just spend some time with the United States Constitution, and consider the hope embedded within it - the hope that the likes of Milius, Bush, and Murdoch repeatedly betray.",Red Dawn

46,blott2319-1,"Certainly adrenaline-fueled, but lacking in character",6,18 May 2020,"I've watched movies where the action gets started quickly, but Red Dawn might hold the record. We do not really get to meet the main characters before the war is rolling, because they utter no more than a couple random lines. Next thing you know, a teacher is murdered in front of their eyes and they are running to the hills. On the one hand, I appreciate the concise story-telling. On the other, I never fully locked into the characters in this film because I didn't feel like I got to know them at all. They certainly have some star power from that era, which is always nice to see, but just because a character is played by Lea Thompson doesn't instantly make me like them (although it is almost enough for her.) I think the relationship between the two brothers is the most fleshed out part of the film, and so their story is what I was most interested in following. A lot of the other boys I got mixed up with one another. I was having a terrible time matching names with faces, so later on it was hard to know who they were talking about when they'd call out a name.It's not difficult to root for any group of underdogs, and the Wolverines certainly fit that description. As young kids with no fighting experience trying to strike back against a full invasion army, you know it's going to be an uphill battle. There is a somewhat odd feeling I get when rooting for terrorist insurgents, but I also recognize that life experience and perspective has changed significantly for Americans since the 1980s, and if I saw Red Dawn then I would never have blinked once at the idea. There's one other aspect of this film that kept me from enjoying it as much as I'd like, but I'll be approaching a major spoiler. If you haven't seen Red Dawn and ever hope to, then read no further. Put simply, I don't enjoy this kind of bleak ending. It has some emotional punch, and there's a sense of hope in the message at the end, but that hope doesn't really apply for the main characters. I mean, if I cared more about any of these kids I would have been deeply depressed by this ending. As it stands, while I appreciated a lot of the action and drama, Red Dawn isn't the kind of film I'll be watching again.

48,gab-14712,Entertaining...To a Degree!,7,2 May 2020,"Red Dawn...is a provocative and interesting movie. On one hand, the actual movie is entertaining, features solid acting from the young cast, and has one of the best introductions to a movie. On the other hand, the political philosophy is quite alarming and nationalistic. When the film was released in 1984, there was an outcry. The film seemed to be an antiwar film with a more conservative feeling, and people felt outraged. That said, I rather thought the film was a decent-enough action film that had some good moments but was rather predictable and overly violent. It is definitely better than the 2012 remake.The script was written by Kevin Reynolds who also wanted to direct the film, but MGM passed on Reynolds due to his inexperience. Instead, they hired John Milius despite most of the studio not agreeing with this choice. Milius was known to love war and the stories it tends to blossom. The studio feared that the choice of Milius directing a film ""about World War III on American soil"" could lead to some nasty consequences. Luckily, Milius was tame in that regard. Milius later recounted that the action in the film is what happened during the second World War. Milius essentially gave us Rambo but with kids.During the cold beginning, schoolchildren look out of their school windows in horror as they see the combined troops from the Soviet Union, Cuba, and Nicaragua land in their schoolyard thus making everyone's fears come true; The United States has been invaded. During the struggles, a group of kids flee to the mountains. These kids are barely armed, and they have to somehow survive this brutal winter. Trouble finds them when they kill a Soviet patrol. This action leads them to start their own guerrilla war against these countries. Will they prevail?The film has its young cast going for it. They all do a good job making their characters believable, even if I felt their characters were not entirely fleshed out. The Wolverines were formed with actors like Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. All familiar names, you may notice. This movie was essentially their starting point. On the flip side, we have some solid veteran actors deliver supporting performances like Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, and Lane Smith. Stanton played one of the kid's fathers and he had a very beautiful scene involving his sons.In addition to the overall sentiment of the film, there was one issue that kept clouding my mind. How on earth do these kids, with little training, are able to destroy soldiers that have years of intense training and combat. Sure, the entertainment value reaches it maximum levels, but the credibility took a big nosedive. I mean, yes, it is fun to see, but watching a movie with those thoughts bogging you down is not what you want. I did like the survival during the winter scenes. They, at least, felt real. Sadly, it could not save the movie.There are some positives to take away. The performances were solid. I liked Basil Poledouris's score. His score is memorable and patriotic which fit the overall theme of the movie. The beginning of the film is my personal favorite. Watching the parachutes falling from the sky is definitely crazy and properly set up the rest of the film, although the rest of the film couldn't exactly follow suit.Overall, Red Dawn was a fun movie. Just barely so. The credibility of many scenes did not work for me. It also felt too nationalistic for my taste. Some may like it, some may hate it, but the violence is very brutal so prepare for a big body count. The film is also a part of history. This is the first film to be rated PG-13, although that is still stretching it by what happens in the film. It could have been worse. Just watch the 2012 remake.My Grade: C+",Red Dawn
49,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Goooood Morning, America!",5,12 July 2009,"""Red Dawn"" starts with a few title cards that provide some background to the story that is about to happen. How a terrible wheat harvest one year started unrest in the USSR and the Eastern Bloc, as well as the rise of Communist forces in South America. Why would a film do this? Well to provide some credible backing for the plot, to give it a sense of realism as if it is ripped from current headlines. It is a pretty good effect. We next see Red Army troops parachute down near a school in a nice tranquil part of small town USA start to gun down all-American school kids.Frankly that's where the film turns from ""political thriller"" to ""nonsense action movie."" It also makes one wonder, why did they bother with the ""realistic"" set up, which was supposedly based on actual military hypothetical scenarios, when for the rest of the movie is one preposterous action scene after another? The entire focus of the movie is how demonic and cruel the Soviets are and how courageous American school kids are. Red Army soldiers are callously gunned down and destroyed in every which way, while each death on the American side is met with sappy drama and grievance. The combat scenes are wholly preposterous and in one scene one of our young heroes actually aims at an approaching gunship with an assault rifle firing from the hip whilst yelling his battle cry. Too bad for him that the gunship is at least one hundred yards away, which, for the pilot isn't very far, but for someone shooting an assault rifle, that's a considerable distance to be blindly spraying bullets and hoping to hit the intended target. Basically, the film attempts to fool its audience with the opening title cards as there is not one hint of realism after the first shot fades in.""Red Dawn"" just plays out as a gun lovers action movie with the unnecessary back drop getting in the way of every scene. John Woo's ""Hard Boiled"" is also a gun lovers action movie, but it has style, it has it's unique feel and just enough plot to keep it going and most important of all it never attempted to be realistic with any sort of background on crime rates in Hong Kong. It was made to accepted as it progresses. ""Red Dawn"" has very little action movie creativity and style with the ""realistic"" attempt at a plausible Cold War plot being nothing more than blunt force mediocrity.There is also the fact, mainly revealed by hindsight after the USSR's collapse, that by 1984 the Soviet Union was in no shape to conduct such an invasion and, in fact, imported most of its wheat - thus didn't rely on its own harvest - and that makes the whole film genuinely absurd and practically a parody of its own paranoid notions. --- 5/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence",Red Dawn

It's kind of intriguing to see pre-""Dirty Dancing"" Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey and pre-""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" Charlie Sheen and Jennifer Grey on screen together, but that's about all the fun you get out of this 1984-picture. Apart from numerous technical flaws (the horrible acting, a boring story without any dramatic peaks or even good action sequences) the morals of ""Red Dawn"" are so screwed up that half a century later we can only look back and shake our heads in wonder.Although there are moments in which the writers of the movie seem to express vaguely humanistic thoughts - such as when one American character wonders who will ever be able to distinguish winners and losers in this (Cold) war, when the American heroes turn against each other at one point and aren't so sure what makes them different to their enemy anymore, or when a ""bad"" Colonel shows a human side (in a horribly contrived scene where he writes a letter to his lover back home) -, ""Red Dawn"" sells killing and martyrdom as something cool without ever depicting the horrors of war properly. We see heroic teenagers fighting for their country and slaughtering the enemies in huge numbers (just were they get all their gear from is never explained properly). There's a scene in which the father of the two main characters (played by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen) talks to his sons from behind the fence of an improvised gulag. As he sends the boys away he screams after them: ""AVENGE ME!"" It is this scene where you realize that something's terribly off about ""Red Dawn"".Much like ""True Blood: Rambo"" and ""Rambo III"", ""Red Dawn"" is propaganda of the most idiotic kind and leaves one looking with much skepticism to the soon to be released remake of ""Red Dawn"", where invading Chinese replace the Soviet army.

53,virek213,"A politically correct film of its time...thus, it has dated badly",5,13 July 2001,"As an action movie, RED DAWN certainly has its logistics in the right place. It also gives us a cast of future stars (Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Patrick Swayze) and veterans (Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, Powers Boothe, William Smith) all giving it their best in a story of a small Colorado town being overrun by Soviet and Cuban forces at the dawn of World War III.Not surprisingly, given when this was made, during the height of the Reagan years and enhanced tensions between the U.S. and the Soviets after the Korean Airlines shootdown, the film's politics worked to parallel real-life nack in 1984.  The further non-surprise is that the film's director, John Milius, is practically the only one of the 1960s film school generation to harbor a seemingly insatiable taste for war, guns, and far right-wing politics.It's too bad that he had to resort to such tastes here, because those beliefs of his totally weigh down what appeared to be a very realistic scenario.  In much the same way that John Wayne (another Hollywood right-wing politico) had allowed his politics to interfere with his cinematic sense in THE GREEN BERETS, Milius allowed his own right-wing brand of political correctness to seriously date RED DAWN today.  His action sequences are inspired more by the mechanations of Sam Peckinpah than anything else, and they are well choreographed.  But the flag-waving bluster of his dialogue is cinematically unnecessary, if not downright laughable now.Simply put, the politics of RED DAWN, much like the similar RAMBO and MISSING IN ACTION films of the same time, have badly dated it in the era of PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.

Plenty of plot twists help keep it interesting. It's not exactly meant to be taken seriously yet does spark some thought.If this country were to be invaded would untrained civilians who the majority of would not have any idea about military tactics have enough fiber to grab their firearms and engage in guerrilla warfare against enemy forces that have been trained in the art of combat?It's one thing to dream it and say it but it's another thing to actually do it. Perhaps many people would, but would they actually have the success that the teens in this film did in destroying the enemy?",Red Dawn
55,Maniac-9,Wolverines!!!,8,4 March 2012,"This is one of my favorite movies as a kid. The movie is about what if Russia and Cuba were able to pull a surprise attack on the United States and actually take control of the country. And then a group of citizens looking to survive band together to fight back as a guerrilla style attack squad. The movie is definitely a product of the Cold War and the fears that went along with that era.The movie stars Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey all very early in their careers.The movie is a bit cheesy but still has a really interesting story to tell.",Red Dawn
56,PeterMitchell-506-564364,Not a bad dawning,7,27 February 2013,"Red Dawn is a film that hit t.v just over three years after it's release at the cinema where I first saw it. At it's second viewing I was quite disturbed, about how easily lives were robbed of us fellow citizens. I don't really remember being disturbed, at my first viewing, it's run, only a week in Adelaide, would you believe. Too it's grim ending, in body count of our bratpackish mob, only sparing two people, left to continue the fight. This was thought provoking at the fact, of how much these American kids were willing to survive this horror hell, where they're stacked up against a insurmountable army of Russian soldiers, sickeningly remorseless in eliminated the enemy. The survival factor was the most frightening element in this film, when a group of teens take refuge in the mountains, after first watching their class mates shot down by enemy forces on their school grounds, where students are scurrying off left right and centre. Lucky Swayze pulled up in his ute. This brave if lucky group, hold out over a year in the mountains, surviving all kind of conditions, determined to defy these sons of bitches, outsmarting them with traps, gutting deer to drink it's blood as well as pillaging a fruit truck. I couldn't understand though, just after the madness, how our three mains went back into town, during the day, amidst enemy tanks, etc, some business's still operating, and also at night, visiting their loved ones, now prisoners, having conversations with them, through wire, without being spotted or shot. At times too, Red Dawn is unintentionally humorous. But not such is the cheap disregard for life, one scene, a huddle of Americans, shot down like cattle. One of the teen's fathers joins the Russian side, the son too, giving up his group, when things get more intense. Pussy. Swayze goes nutty at him. I always remember this defining Swayze acting moment. ""You son of a bittttchhhhh!"" C Thomas Howell as Robert, in not a bad performance, the most affected, who becomes gun crazy, just ends the betrayer. His own demise is memorable, his AK 47 against a chopper shooting out rockets, where's he's in open view. No I don't think so. This film overall, has a bleak and terrifying aura about it, as really, ""How long can these kids last?"". But this is what compliments it, as it makes us takes the situation seriously. It's a ""this could happen"" movie and ""this is how it would go down"" if in reality. But even though it comes across quite real, some moments powerfully strong in parts, it came disjointed in bits, too where the suspense got lost. Granted, Red Dawn is no flawless masterpiece, but is indeed a thought provoking watch, but I wouldn't feel right, saying educational.",Red Dawn
57,Aylmer,PG-13 Cold War Shoot-em-up,7,21 February 2014,"Commies invade Northern New Mexico subbing for Colorado, and a bunch of High School kids led by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen must fend them off. Ridiculous right-wing paranoia makes for entertaining cinema in retrospect, making this a time capsule of the last serious years of The Cold War when America was starting to cathartically pump out action movies in which the anthropomorphized ideal of the stars and stripes decimates the Soviet army. Rambo II and III did the same.Pros:-Lots of action, very high production values allowing for very authentic looking Soviet equipment, lovingly captured during a few tank battles. These were the days before surplus Soviet T-72s made their way to American screens, so they had to build these and they look terrific. Lots of squibs, explosions, and excellent sound design to bring them to life.-The supporting cast is top notch featuring a great assortment of familiar faces and old pro's including Ben Johnson, Harry Dean Stanton, William Smith, etc.-It's pretty well-written considering it's just an 80's action movie. They do some pretty creative things with the buildup to making hapless teens into a fighting resistance movement. The villains are mostly nicely fleshed-out too and humanized more than I would have expected.-Great score by Basil Poledouris for the most part.Cons:-The action is mostly pretty comic book and lacks realism. We're asked to believe that a ragtag band of teens could outwit and out-shoot trained Russian and Cuban soldiers consistently and take zero casualties, even when grossly outnumbered. -A key scene in which one of the members of the group is exposed as a traitor and executed is handled extremely lazily, shot entirely from one angle, alternating between the master shot and a longer-lens camera for singles. The film never really recovers from there.-A lot of the performances by the teen actors are uneven and exacerbated by putting them in unbelievable situations. Swayze's delivery often comes across as awkward and forced when he's trying to be brooding and serious.-The best character in the film, Tanner, is unfortunately not around for very long at all.Conclusion? Best for viewing for history / war / military equipment buffs. It's not perfect by a long stretch but certainly one of the most memorable movies of the 80's.",Red Dawn

However, I can see where they come from when they say they hated this movie. The Americans were portrayed as good guys and almighty heroes and whatnot. The communist soldiers were portrayed as thuggish, mindless, stupid, pure evil, and with no motive to their invasion of the U.S. BUT this movie was not meant to be a ""documentary"" (as said in ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"" , where they say ""..the documentary ""Red Dawn""). It was meant to satisfy U.S. ""anti-soviet"" feelings during the 80's.

Don't ask me why but I never got around to seeing this movie until I last night 1/23/2012. When I saw the opening scene, I thought cool this is going to be an awesome movie. Imagine your in high school, listing to your History teacher and all of a sudden numerous paratrooper come falling out of the sky. The shock of it would make anyone stand up and take notice; especially when they start opening up fire on you and killing numerous classmates. I guess if I saw this back when I was a teenager and tensions with The Soviet Union, were high I probably would have liked it more. The Soviet Union is no more, some of it is in numerous Countries, i.e. Russia, Kazakhstan, etc.. I just thought since I'm older the whole story was very unrealistic, think about it; USSR/CUBA invading USA, where is our military? You do not see any sign of USA troops, at all; a helicopter and that's it. A bunch of high school kids fighting against Soviets/Cuban's. No way, our military would be all over, the Country would be on lock down; and kids fighting a superpower like the Soviet Union very unreal.

⚪
All in all, John Milius' eighties classic parachutes with a lot of seriousness and drops in hostile territory of anti-communistic propaganda, archaic enemy images and exaggerated patriotism, but despite its utter silliness and hilariously unrealistic concept, it is smart enough in the context of its story, what causes it to make a lot fun, and thanks to a superb cast lead by a charismatic Patrick Swayze, a comparatively coherent plot and decent practical effects, it becomes an incredibly stupid yet extremely entertaining, paranoid war fantasy that's too much fun to be terrible.
⚪
As a proclaimed adorer of Emile Ardolino's ""Dirty Dancing"", the reason I originally became aware of this flick was that it marks the first collaboration of the leading actors of the iconic dance romance, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, and since I am also a die-hard fan of the first's films, it was almost mandatory for me to watch it. However, it wasn't quite easy to track down a Blu-Ray of this film, as it was literally sold out in Germany, and if anyone was offering it, then it was for a utopian price only. So, after months of searching, I was able to get hold of a copy, moreover a British one - and of course, for a reasonable price. Regarding the film, I wasn't expecting much, I just hoped that it would have been worth the time and money - and in the end, it did. I am not going to say that it is a great film, because it is anything but this, but I've had so much with it that it is almost ridiculous. Like, the basic concept is totally bonkers in the first place: out of nowhere, the Russians land in the United States and begin to shoot everything down. In the matter of seconds, an invasion has started, and World War III has begun. The enemy has taken over parts of the country, and it is about a group of teenagers, who were able to escape the attackers at first, and how they fight them and save their hometown from subjugation. Sounds completely crazy? It is, and there is really no denying about that. Considering that this film was released during the zenith of the Cold War, it is obvious why it has been produced in the first place. It is a blatant attempt of conveying anti-communism, patriotism and superiority in a fictional motion picture - and living out one of the most feared scenarios in the history of the USA. Seriously, this film oozes nationalism and follows the plain concept ""Russia bad, America good"" with a ridiculous one-dimensionality. Yes, it is an undeniably hilarious political statement, a weird demonstration of power, but it is extremely entertaining. As someone who is neither American nor Russian, I don't care about the political aspect of this film or find it offensive (it is still a work of fiction), and I am not going to deny the total absence of logic and realism, but once I was able to look past it, I had a great time with it. Honestly, I probably even enjoyed it much more than I should have. The basic premise of the films sounds like it could have originated from an online multiple battle royale game in the likes of ""PUBG"", and since I liked it a lot when I was younger, the situation was all too familiar. Like, who wouldn't want to wage a guerrilla war against an invading force with the best friends? All fun put aside, the film makes the best out of it silly premise, and it is mostly thanks to outstanding cast. Next to Swayze as the leader of the group Jed (named after an American icon), we have future ""Two And A Half Men"" superstar, Charlie Sheen, ""Back To The Future"" star Lea Thompson, ""Dirty Dancing"" lead Jennifer Grey, ""E.T."" actor C. Thomas Howell, action movie warhorse Powers Booth and also a short but significant appearance of Harry Dean Stanton as the protagonist's father. Yes, there is a lot of star power here, and that makes it a lot easier for me to identify with them, as I simply love most of the previously mentioned actors. Together, this group of kids, named ""The Wolverines"", give the Russians hell, and it is equally dumb and entertaining to watch them do this. Aside from the fact that alleged teenagers, pubescent high school students, act like they are professionally trained soldiers and know to use all the weapons and equipment they find along the way (hey, Jed's father used to take him and his brother on hunting trips, so it makes a lot of sense, I guess?!), their success rate is ridiculously high. I mean, they are just a bunch of scared kids, and you want to tell me that they can fool a freaking army like this? Not really, but again, look past the stupidity, and you will find some in fact decent aspects about it. Since they are just adolescents, their fear about the whole situation is thematised, nevertheless. In many scenes you can see them breaking down in tears because of the mental overload, and in others you can visibly see how they struggle with the fact that they have killed and will have to kill even more - again, they are just kids. However, as the movie goes on, they are increasingly more inured to the situation (mostly thanks to the training of Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Tanner, who they pick up along the way), and dare to do even more - what soon after shows them their mortality. At first, I was sceptical about the fact that none of the kids was injured or killed in the first assaults on the Russian troops, but then it became more and more threatening. The frequent losses of said troops lead the enemy to react accordingly and send reinforcements. Soon after, ""The Wolverines"" are outnumbered and what started as a funny act of resistance turns into a nightmare of betrayal, horror and death. One by one, the oh so powerful group is decimated, and in the end, all of them are killed brutally. Yes, against my own expectations, the film did a 180, and all the characters that seemed to be untouchable are dead. Even though the film ends with the fact that the Americans eventually won the war and that those teenagers were honoured for the braveness, it was still shocking to see. Speaking of which, this film furthermore convinces with its extreme grittiness. Considering that it was the first film to ever receive a PG-13, it was extremely brutal. Next to a graphic massacre of a school class in the course of which kids are butchered by the invaders, it was extremely intense to see the juvenile protagonists being hunted down one by one as well. Also, the practical effects such as explosions, blood and gore were surprisingly realistic, what added to the horror as well. Yes, the film oozed patriotism and embodies the slogan ""Live Free Or Die Trying"" in all its silly glory, but aside from the basic stupidity of its concept, it nevertheless delivers decent and horrifying action. The acting is acceptably solid, in the context of its own absurdity, it is astonishingly smart and coherent, and once again, way too much fun to watch. Surely, the cold war propaganda predominant in this case, but all politics put aside, it delivers guilty pleasure entertainment. I could see this as a mini-series, honestly, but they have to change the premise a little in order to make it acceptable. Until then, this will be my movie.",Red Dawn
68,deanofrpps,Occupied America,8,12 May 2007,"This movie, starring Patrick Swayze, ominously released in the benchmark year 1984, either came out after its time or before it by almost 30 years, dependent on your perspective. As a movie about a Russian invasion it fits in a genre of 1950s era bleak futurism of the prime time of the US's cold war with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As a movie about a determined resistance against a technologically superior occupier, it anticipated the US's dilemma in Irak by equal distance.At time of its release the prospect of the US defending against an occupation was nihl; the circumstances under which a major foreign intervention might be undertaken were to far beyond the horizon to be foreseeable. Certainly President Reagan regarded the cold war adversary to be an Evil Empire; few others did.Yet this is a film that transcended its genre and the test of time such that it might be taken as a metaphor for the war in Irak.There are some points of realism in the film: the brutality of the initial invasion much like the much bandied shock and awe as the US media glorified the initial incursion into Irak and the kinder and gentler approach taken by the second Soviet commander who tells subordinates the farmer doesn't kill the pig because the horse kicked him in the mouth. The soviet's second commander sounds much like General Petraes who tells us we have had incremental progress however imperceptible. The exploits of the resisters in this movie are not unlike the dreary reports of US reverses whenever some news leaks out of Irak.Given the extreme sensitivity inside the US today to the very hint of criticism of the war in Irak, I'm surprised this movie is allowed to be shown.",Red Dawn

It tries to be some sort of serious film full of emotions and philosophy and stuff. Charlie Sheen had practically an identical role in ""Hot Shots, part deux"", but at least there he knew it was a comedy.

This is no 'Merica!! fluff piece.It's more basically a ""war is hell"" picture, and tells it from a unique point of view. It portrays most directly these American kids becoming guerrillas in their own back yard. That's very dark and very well done.But what makes it more special is that it depicts the invaders as actual human beings. Particularly the very young Soviet soldiers in the first Wolverine battle. These are kids too, and are shown as such. They are just cogs in this massive wheel, and in a very slightly different reality, they could be trading drinks and playing ball with the American kids.Then there's the later ""what's the difference between us and them?"" ""We live here!!"" Poignant, to put it mildly.
On the meta level, this has a particularly potent version of the Brat Pack, and they act their butts off. Swayzee, Grey, Howell, Sheen, etc etc etc. And add in Booths!Revisionists like to point out that the USSR never had this much power, and was in decay at the time. While it's true that an actual invasion like this was always extremely implausible, the movie does lay out it's alternate history premise right at the beginning.

73,squirrel_burst,"Not great, but there's a lot of appeal nonetheless and it's memorable",6,22 April 2015,"""Red Dawn"" does a good job setting up its somewhat fantastical scenario but it's very much a product of its time and might not ring the same way it did when it was first released. I still feel like has a certain amount of appeal, but if you love this movie it's mostly the nostalgia talking. When the United States is invaded by the Soviet Union and its Cuban and Nicaraguan allies, the Americans are overwhelmed. While this Third World War rages, our story begins to take place. A small group of high school students arm themselves, hide in the woods and resist the invaders with guerrilla warfare, assembling underneath the name of their high school mascot, the Wolverines.The special effects are good and to someone that would be genuinely fearful of an invasion by the soviets this could be a dream come true or a really frightening scenario. I enjoyed the fact that the film gets into its premise right away, telling anyone that doesn't buy the premise to promptly leave the theatre or stop complaining about the events that are taking place. The film also does a good job portraying the long passage of time and the changes that happen to the characters as they become more accustomed to guerilla warfare. Where the film doesn't work is in the emotional growth and towards the end where our heroes make decisions that feel out of character and downright stupid. While I was able to buy the premise fully, I did find that this story doesn't feel as fleshed out as it should be. I'm leaning more towards ""video game-like"" than ""epic"" when choosing what word to define the storyline, despite the fact that there is a full-blown war going on.If you can suspend your disbelief (and the film does take the time to set itself up as a possible scenario so it shouldn't be too hard) and put yourself in the mentality of the red scare you will get a kick out of this, though you might leave wanting more when it comes to the story and characters.

76,Hancock_the_Superb,"Cheesy, mindless fun",7,8 April 2007,"One day, in the town of Calumet, Colorado, high school students are setting through a boring history lecture when a group of Russian and Cuban paratroopers show up in the back of the school, firing machine guns into the classroom and RPGs at school buses! Fast-forward a bit, and a handful of teens from the school (Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Leah Thompson, C. Thomas Howell, Brad Savage, Darren Dalton, Doug Toby) have fled to the mountains, with rifles, bows-and-arrows, and some soup. After witnessing the imprisonment of Swayze and Sheen's father (Harry Dean Stanton) and hearing about the murder of Howell's (Roy Jenson), they form the guerrilla group, the Wolverines, who go from a few kids in the woods with rifles to a fearsome terror that strikes fear into the hearts of their occupiers. The inept Communists (led by Vladek Sheybal and a sympathetic Ron O'Neal) are unable to handle the situation, until the fearsome Colonel Strelnikov (William Smith) - not the guy from ""Doctor Zhivago"" - shows up with actually effective tactics which decimate the Wolverines. The Wolverines are ultimately forced to make a desperate last stand to save America and kick some Commie butt! Ignoring the heavy-handed political aspect of the film - not to mention the plausibility - one should take into consideration that ALL of John Milius' films, especially this one, are at heart escapist fantasy films. This movie involves the ultimate childhood fantasy - forming a guerrilla band with your friends to fight off invading enemy forces. What red-blooded ten-year-old American boy doesn't dream of doing that? I know I did, and spent hours re-enacting the film in the backyard with my brothers. Anyone criticizing the film should view it on that level, and that's why my review includes so many exclamation points and informal writing.Is the film realistic? No, not really - as others have pointed out, it's basically an alternate history where enough things go wrong (Soviet invasion of Poland, collapse of NATO, Communist take-over of Latin America) to make the invasion possible. The story of teenagers going into the woods and forming a guerrilla group, however, is not THAT implausible; Milius had the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in mind, but throughout history there are innumerable instances of such groups being formed. The movie's pro-2nd Amendment posturing is a bit ham-fisted, but it's nonetheless a very pertinent argument - the main reason the US will probably never be invaded by conventional forces is because they'll be facing down the barrels of 200,000,000 privately owned guns, even if they defeat our armed forces.However, Milius' film does contain a lot of realistic detail, in the uniforms/hardware of the Communists. And how refreshing is it to hear Russian/Cuban soldiers actually speaking Russian and Spanish? And how cool is the casting of bad-ass character actor and ex-Marlboro Man William Smith as Strelnikov - a guy who is also a fluent Russian speaker and actually taught it at UCLA for several years? The great Vladek Sheybal plays a nasty villain for the umpteenth time in his career, but what the hell, he's good at it. And Ron O'Neal's Colonel Bella is actually a sympathetic character - as an ex-partisan himself, he can sympathize with the guerrillas, and is repulsed by the heavy-handed tactics of his colleagues.The teen acting is not god-awful. If one can get past the laughable opening (I still don't know why the spearhead of the Russian forces would attack a high school, but what do I know?), you see surprisingly well-drawn characters. Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen are the best as the Eckert Brothers, holding up their end well. Their relationship is believable, and Swayze in particular is good as the quarterback who is thrust into a life-or-death situation. The rest of the cast - a veritable Who's-Who of '80s stars (is this enough to say it's a Brat Pack film?) - is not as good, though to be fair they have less to do. It is kind of amusing to C. Thomas Howell as a border-line psychopath though. It doesn't hurt that their parents are played by great character actors like Ben Johnson (""The Wild Bunch""), Roy Jenson (""The Wind and the Lion""), Lane Smith (""V""), and Harry Dean Stanton (""Cool Hand Luke"") either. And there's the great Powers Boothe as Tanner, the hotshot fighter pilot who briefly joins up with the gang.The film's action scenes are pretty good throughout. They aren't the most impressive you'll ever see, but they're believably done. Highlights include the initial skirmish with a Russian patrol (killed after deliberately misreading a National Park Service plaque) and the liberation of the Russian re-education camp.""Red Dawn"" is, in short, a very cheesy, silly, dated film (we haven't even mentioned the cheesy '80s syntho-score), but one that is good for some mindless fun and a few laughs if you're in the right mood. Release your inner child, forget your political leanings and enjoy one of the silliest movies ever made. WOLVERINES! 7/10",Red Dawn
77,kingofdanerds,The first PG-13 movie fails to dissappoint,9,9 September 2020,"Red Dawn is notably the first film to ever be released with the PG-13 rating. Released in 1984, Red Dawn was a success at the box office but recieved mixed reviews at the time of release and was controversial for the violence and the depiction of war. The film was directed by John Milius who previously directed Conan the Barbarian in 1982. The film notably has early performances from Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Charlie Sheen, and Jennifer Grey. All of whom were obscure actors/actresses and after the release of Red Dawn, they became quite popular.Red Dawn starts in the fictional town of Calumet, Colorado where one day Russians parachute down and attempt to take over the United States (with the help from Cuba and Nicaragua). It's up to a group of teens (who are known as the Wolverines) to fight against these invaders.Red Dawn is an anti-communism type of film and it was really relevant back in 1984 and is even relevant in way today. It gives us this ""What If?"" scenario about communist invaders invading America. It is an interesting scenario if you think about it. This is one of the few action/war movies that manages to be quite successful at both action and war. The action is done pretty well in terms of explosions but this film does not have a whole lot of suspense. There are a few scenes (really the ones that matter) that have suspense but everything in the middle lacks the suspense of the beginning and end of the film. The firefights and explosions make me go ""Hell yeah!"" every time. When the Wolverines are successful, I too want to scream ""WOLVERINES!!!"". The cast is very likeable as well as the characters who are not the best developed characters in cinema but they are developed enough that they make me want to fight along side them because who would want to watch a character that they wouldn't want to be around? Plus, they are teenagers and as a teenager (at the time of this review) I have this feeling of strength by watching this film. If a character dies, I feel sad. There are a few relationships that spring about in the film and they are not done well at all for the fact is is that they happen out of nowhere. The cinematography is quite beautiful and does set this movies tone. There is one particular scene where Jed, Matt, and Robert are heading into town and they cross through this battlefield with destroyed tanks and helicopters, solidifying that America is the battlefield. One complaint that I have is the passage of time. The film follows the Wolverines throughout the span of a few months. The transition from one month to another is not done well at all and sometimes happens quite fast to the point when one of these transitions happen I am like, ""Um, Ok then"". There are a few ""plot twists"" (if you want to call them that). There is really only one of these ""plot twists"" and the only reason why I am surprised is because it somewhat happens out of nowhere much like some other events in this film. So I guess it works because I am just as surprised as the other characters??? This film clocks in at a little less than two hours and this film manages to use that time pretty well.Despite having some flaws, Red Dawn is a violent, ""What If?"" movie which is pretty entertaining. Likeable characters, great effects and cinematography, Red Dawn (at least in my opinion) is pretty underrated and should be appreciated by more people.",Red Dawn
78,fredericksmith1952,"Soviets, Cubans, and the Good Old USA",10,24 January 2012,"Wow, I was browsing through my collection and came across this one. My first thought was how do I relate this film to the present. After all, the Soviet Union and the Cuban Communist threats have faded into history. I guess this is why they are remaking this film using North Korea as the aggressor instead of the Soviet Union. Well, no matter, since the plot of the film is still viable, war from the perspective of the civilians who are trapped behind enemy lines. Patrick Swayze leads a very competent cast in portraying Jedidiah Eckert, a young man in his 20's who must bear the burden of survival for five boys who are with him from the high school. Charlie Sheen does well as his brother (this is long before he decided that life would be better with a drug induced perspective), and C. Thomas Howell is dynamic as the boy who becomes a man. Jennifer Grey and Leah Thompson add a dimension of women in combat, and both do well in the roles, although Thompson fails to convey the angst of a girl who has been molested by the invading soldiers. Powers Boothe gives us a look at a fighter pilot hoping for the best and believing the worst. His plane has been shot down, he doesn't know if his family is still alive, and still he fights to the best of his ability ""How did you get yourself shot down?"" ""It was five to one, I got four!"" Harry Dean Stanton gives a brief but powerful performance as Mr. Eckert, Jed and Mattie's father. The photography and scenery are magnificent, and the attention to detail is exceptional. While the violence is enough to keep the preteen set away from the screen, the language is good and there are no scenes of nudity or drug use.",Red Dawn
79,ThreeGuysOneMovie,A cheesy guilty pleasure,7,3 June 2012,"Ronald Reagan was right, those dirty commies are going to invade our shores. The film takes place in a small town in rural Colorado, right in the middle of the second red scare, during the 1980′s. The Russians, Cubans and some other nefarious commies attack the town right in the middle of history class. Troops parachute in behind the school, open fire and start to take over the town. Who can honestly say they did not daydream such a scenario during a particularly boring lecture in high school? Prepare for a mashup of a high school teen drama an action packed war film and some cheesy fun.As the bullets start flying our heroes make their escape in Jed's (Swayze) pickup truck. Teachers, fellow classmates, townspeople are being gunned down and rounded up, as the boys make their way to a general store on the outskirts of town. Thankfully, the boys are able to load up on supplies, bows, guns, canned food, sleeping bags, water etc are quickly loaded into Jed's truck. The group heads to the perceived safety of familiar hunting grounds in the wooded mountains, to escape capture.unfortunately, the groups radio was shot up in the escape. Lacking information about what has happened in the town, and running low on supplies, the group consisting of Jed (Swayze), Robert (Howell), Matt (Sheen) Daryl (Dalton), Aradvark (Toby) and Danny (Savage), decide to conduct a reconnaissance mission in town. The group is horrified to discover, that the town is under martial law, and that the Russian invaders have occupied a large section of the United States. To make matters even worse family members, and people who helped in their escape have been killed, or placed in re-education camps. Jed and Matt visit their wounded father, Mr. Eckert (Stanton) locked in a re-education camp, and learn their mother is dead, along with other family members. He instructs the boys, to stay in the mountains, never cry for him and to ""Avenge Me!!!! Avenge Me!!!"". Stanton might provide the only part of the film that would be considered passable acting during this scene.A random run in with some occupying troops, making a tourist stop in the mountains, to snap some photos, leads to the group killing 3 troops. The occupying forces react to these killings by rounding up some townspeople, and executing them en mass, at the funeral for the slain troops. Witnessing the killings from afar the group decides to exact revenge via gurellia warfare. This is when the film really starts to take off both in terms of action, excitement, and complete lack of plausibility. The rest of the movies details the groups increasing successful attacks upon the occupying troops and the brutality of the occupiers. WOLVERINES!!!!!!This film is a bit difficult to review as it saddled with a ludicrous plot, wooden acting, lack of character development and forced emotion. By the same token its undeniably fun to watch, as the guerrilla group known as the wolverines extracts a terrible, if un-realistic revenge upon those evil commie invaders. This film lands firmly in the realm of cheesy, guilty pleasure. People who came of age in the 1980′s probably recall this film fondly, and considered the possibility of joining the wolverines, on more than one occasion. New viewers might be a bit confused by what all the fuss was about with this film. The bottom line is that this is not a very good movie. However, much like ones inability to pass up greasy cheeseburger or a sugary bear claw, it's an enjoyable experience. While I cannot with good conscience give this film a high score, I still recommend giving this guilty pleasure a watch.Like what you see here?

Ernesto Bella ( who does realize what happened is wrong). Spoilers: What is frightening about it ( almost 30 years after it came out ( not to mention 9/11)), is the ending with Erica who is only one of two survivors at ""Freedom Rock"" pointing out about never seeing the brothers (Jed and Robert) again, and this awesome quote. "" in the early years of World War III, guerrillas mostly children, placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives ""so this nation would not perish from the Earth"". With everything that has happened since Obama has been elected, the lessons of this film has been forgotten.

83,xbrad68,The Russians and the Chinese could still invade America,10,26 June 2004,Red Dawn is a cold war movie that made people think in its day that America could be invaded. Today Russia and China are still very capable of invading AMERICA together. As a CIA informant I have heard rumors about an alliance between Russia and China. If they invade with airborne forces I don't think AMERICA could stop them with over 100 thousand troops out of the country without using NUCLEAR WEAPONS. Red Dawn Director John Milius is outstanding in his use of tight camera angles. Lea Thompson as Erica is a Cinematic rarity because she is a Woman American resistance fighter. C. Thomas Howell is believable in the role of Robert Morris. Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze get the tearful scene as the Eckert brothers all shot up inside a boxcar and discovered by their nemesis Col. Strelnikov. Powers Boothe as Col. Andy Taylor provides the Military knowhow to the Wolverines. It figures that the anti-military types in America would give RED DAWN a low rating. In case I don't survive the coming Chinese and Russian attack I would just like to say that OLD SPOOKS DONT FADE AWAY THEY JUST SIGH AN AURA. I gave Red Dawn a 10 out of 10.,Red Dawn
84,blazesnakes9,"They called themselves, THE WOLVERINES.",7,22 May 2011,"There are a lot of things that movies have that happens so often. Invasions. Invasions from outer space or something that landed on Earth. And that is the case in Red Dawn, the action thriller that ask the question , What would happens if the Soviet Union attacks the United States? During the 1980's, the Cold War was still brewing. Movies started coming out that involved the U.S. getting involved with the Soviet Union. Films like WarGames and Rocky IV were taking the premise that the U.S. fighting against the Russians and also, the Cubans. Patrick Swayze plays a resident of the small town. His family members are fighting for their lives. So, a couple of high school students starts to fight back against the Russians. Then, they called themselves, The Wolverines, naming it after their high school sport mascot. Soon enough, the Wolverines takes over the Russian invasion in their small town, showing that they are strong to eliminate them. This is a good action movie, but what I notice is that Red Dawn starts out too early for the invasion scenes. But, that's okay, because Red Dawn is a good natural action flick. ★★★ 3 stars.",Red Dawn
85,matlock-6,Exciting cold war era film,6,11 July 2003,"Filmed during the strained Reagan/Andropov cold war years, Red Dawn depicts the nightmare that was never far from the minds of Americans (the constant reminders given us by our ""leaders"" probably had something to do with it).Acting is decent, with a pretty good performance turned in by Patrick Swayze as the unofficial leader of a group of teenage guerrillas.This film works because it plays on the fears of the average American. Soviet and Latin American communist forces parachute into a moderately sized town in the US midwest and assault the average people. The attempt seems to be to draw a connection between this and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which must have been similar (considering Afghanistan is mostly rural, there were probably only small towns and villages to attack). At the same time, the message is ""Nobody is safe"".In reality, these people would have been aware of a Soviet invasion a long time before this happened, because any strategist worth his salt would have sent initial sneak attacks to disrupt military installations first. Why would you initiate a sneak attack on a defenseless town when you could smash military installations first, then simply go into town and take over? The huge military response would have crushed them before they got anywhere, and they simply wouldn't have enough troops to attack both military and civilian targets.In any case, overlooking the nit picking of a history nut will ensure that you get to see a very exciting and well written and acted movie.",Red Dawn
86,dave-sturm,The parallels are striking,8,23 May 2008,"John Milius has given us a striking template of a movie with Red Dawn. Resistance to foreign occupation follows certain patterns no matter where or under what circumstances and the movie pushes a remarkable number of emotional buttons along the way. I have watched it many times.Consider: Collaboration with the occupiers. Young people as the most passionate among the resistance. Conflicted occupiers, some believing themselves righteous and others with doubts. Ambush as the main tactic of the resistance. Resistance fighters operating right under the noses of the occupiers. Occupiers baffled by what they see as an alien culture. Soldiers of the occupied country clandestinely helping the resistance.Now think about Iraq and Afghanistan and who the Wolvlerines are there.",Red Dawn
87,rmarkd,Probably would have liked it more watching as a kid in the 80s,5,3 June 2020,"The Russians and Russian allies decide to invade the US. After hitting our larger targets with nukes, they invade with conventional weapons.Soviet, Nicaraguan, and Cuban troops invade a Colorado town and capture everyone except for a band of kids who manage to get away, head to the mountains, and plan surprise attacks against what must be the stupidest group of military folks (division? squad? dunno what to call it, but they're idiots nonetheless).A bunch of kids, living up in the mountains, hiding from military troops, able to win battles against these troops. Troops who can't find these kids even though they light campfires at night. Troops trained in combat ambushed by kids even when they managed to plant a bug on one of the kids so they knew exactly where the kids were. They still lost the battle.I get the appeal. I was a kid in the 80s (but never saw the movie) and the whole Russian thing was something you were at least aware of. And, yeah, wouldn't it be great to be part of a ragtag bunch of kids and take on the Soviet army (or, I guess Nicaraguan/Cuban 3rd stringers). I'm sure had I seen it at that time and at that age, I would have liked it much more. Maybe. But watching it now, I found it to be largely unbelievable, kinda slow, but with an entertaining campiness about it. As such, I very mildly disliked it, so 5/10 that could have gone to a 6/10 if I were in a better mood.This movie is another one that had been on my list solely because I wanted to get the whole ""Wolverines!"" context. So, glad I do now. But I think my favorite line was ""Wrong, commie! It's Houston."" when one of the kids asks a shot down pilot what the capital of Texas was. I think it was meant to be a joke as to some people think the capital is Houston. However, I took it to also show that, yeah, these are *kids*. Couple that with the fact that most of these kids die.. it was a bit more of a downer than I was initially thinking it would be. Points for that.",Red Dawn
88,mitchell5954,One of My Favorite War Movies Now!,8,30 September 2013,"Red Dawn is I found to be a fun and intense war movie as well as a good what if story As far as this movie goes I enjoyed it. I thought it was an interesting idea, the action was good, there are some fun characters, and it can be intense in places. However, there are some definite issues I have with the film as well. I have not seen the remake, so I cannot comment on that film.The story is set in an alternate reality where Russia and Cuba have invaded America. The story follows eight high school kids lead by Jed (Patrick Swayze). Their town gets invaded by soviet forces and their parent have been either captured or killed. These eight teenagers form a resistance called The Wolverines, which is named after their football team, and gives the soviets hell. They are also joined later on by a Col. Andrew Tanner (Powers Boothe) who joins their team for a little while.I have seen many war movies as well as TV series now. There are some I enjoy like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers and others I did not care for like The Deer Hunter (yes I said it). Red Dawn I will say is probably one of my favorite war movies now. I like a lot of the characters like Jed and Colonel Andrew. Charlie Sheen is even in this movie playing Jed's younger brother Matt. Charlie looked so young in this and had such a weird hairdo that, at times, I could not even tell it was him. However, I liked his performance as well as the character Matt. The film also has some decent action scenes that will keep you entertained and even at times wish you were one of them.This film is in a way great vicarious entertainment, at least at some parts. Many of us probably fantasized once in our lives about forming a gang of rebels, blowing away enemy forces, and getting praised as legends for doing so. However, the film can also get quite dark in other places especially the end. This film does play into the tragedy of war and the effects it has on people and, in my opinion, it does it quite well. The film does not end on a triumphant note really. It was not ultra-depressing, but it was not the triumphant ending I was expecting.The film does have some faults though. Many of the characters do not get enough character development or screen time. This movie is more about the action and the tragedy of war than on character development, which is fault. Powers Boothe's character Andrew is especially underused. He shows up and joins the main group near the middle and is killed of like fifteen minutes later. I did not care for that because he is my favorite character in the film. Another minor fault is that sometimes the dialog and the acting, particularly from Swayze feels very clunky and unnatural.Overall, Red Dawn is a very underrated war movie and just an underrated film in general. If you are a fan of war movies then give this a look. For those who have seen the remake and see how it stakes-up to you. I've heard nothing but bad things about the remake so my guess is the original is much better.",Red Dawn
89,jacksonc,It is what you might expect...,10,19 February 2002,"If you, as I did, grew up during the so-called ""Red scare"" era, thismovie is fairly standard for the 1950s except that it was made nearthe middle of the 1980s. On one level, it is first rate scare propaganda and quitechauvinistic (or was when the Soviet Union was still a viableentitiy). On another level it puts one in mind of LORD OF THEFLIES. On any level, it is an honest action/war movie that is not without atouch of ironic humor (only once or twice - it is usually anunrelenting downer). It also has some good talent (Ben Johnson, Patrick Swayze, etc.).One thing: my wife has pointed out that the male guerillas alwayslook clean and squared away while the two female guerillasusually look quite scroungy.

We just go to the general store, take their rifles, their ammunition...oh, yes, grab a box or two of eats. That will keep us from getting hungry for all the months that we're up in the mountains.John Milnus brought us a film which combines the Reaganite ""The Russians are coming"" line with the NRA idea that all you need to defend your freedom is a gun and the ability to spend a little time away from electricity. The movie postulates that the Soviet bloc were able to just brush aside America's conventional and nuclear forces and land paratroops right into Colorado, with the help of illegal aliens. Not only is a racial slur involved, but the scenario is in contradiction of military logic. Drop paratroopers in the middle of a hostile country? Um -why? I only hope no one got their ideas of partisan combat from this film. To anyone who has read about the classic guerilla wars of the 20th century - Ireland, Yugoslavia, Vietnam or Afganistan, to name just a few - ""Red Dawn"" will come across as grippingly realistic as ""Red Zone Cuba"" (q.v.). Never do Patrick Swayze and his little gang have to go into town to execute collaborators, or man a roadblock to collect war taxes. Never are we confronted with the unpleasant truth that America, like every other country, has its ethnic divisions, and if these white, rural kids are acting outside the current government, it would a natural move by an occupier to recruit counterguerilla forces from their opposites. There has almost never been a irregular combat campaign that did not get ugly in ways this movie misses entirely.But I did have to admire the way no matter how tough things got, the hair of both Patrick Swayze and Lea Thompson never looked less than perfect.Apparently the hair salons were still fully functional.",Red Dawn

OK.No real plot just a lot of battle scenes that make no sense and defy logic...so if you like Rambo then this one is for you.

This film is really about what could happen if we were invaded by an enemy and about kids fighting back to defend freedom. The cast is incredible: (Particularly Patrick Swayze (Jed Eckert), Charlie Sheen (His brother Matt) and Lea Thompson (Erica) who also is the narrator of the film). My favorite scenes are where the brothers embrace before they die, and the ending with Erica at ""Partisan Rock"", with a plaque that reads: ..In the early days of World War III, guerrillas - mostly children - placed the names of their lost upon this rock.

We're talking about a Lenin here -- a jihadi Lenin who controls the flow of the ideology but also gives the nod with regards to general strategic direction............... Al-Qaradawi seeks not only an Islamic Super-State in the Middle East. He's working for the day when Islam will conquer America and Europe – through immigration and proselytizing.

American regular citizens find themselves taking up arms in a guerilla war against the invaders.

First, it's unusual for a big-budget film to get made without political correctness killing any such competing statement.  Second, it's a valid cold war warning, since the old Soviet Union used exactly the methods shown to take over countries nearer to them, challenging US geographic safety with a what-if scenario.

96,CaressofSteel75,This was the war everybody was planning for.,8,11 April 2014,"Red Dawn has endured a lot of criticism over the years including a lot of people who have posted reviews here on IMDb. I was a teenager when this movie came out, and the reviews at the time almost universally derided Red Dawn as a bloated, right wing war fantasy with an unrealistic premise.Let's set the record straight. If you remember the Cold War, you know that both the USA and the USSR spent decades planning, preparing and war gaming the scenario that plays out in this movie, and others. B 52s flew 24/7 to respond to just this type of attack on US soil. It's what we all were afraid of. We can quibble about the realism of the actual invasion or the inclusion of Central American forces, etc. But none of this lessens the fact that these were the geopolitics of the day. No doubt that a lot of the bad press for Red Dawn came on the heels of war movies with a post Vietnam point of view like the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. Red Dawn does come off like a B movie actioner in comparison and has a viewpoint more in tune with a John Wayne WWII movie.When it was released, some people didn't accept the concept of a teenage guerilla force taking on the Russians, but the fact is- history shows that partisans and resistance fighters who fought occupation forces were very often women and children. Those are the people who have to fight when your leadership is captive and your regular army is defeated.There's lots of familiar faces in this movie which makes it fun to watch now. Big Bill Smith makes an appearance half way through as Strelnikov, the Russian enforcer. Ron O'Neal and Powers Boothe get a lot of screen time. Patrick Swayze is Patrick Swayze, along with the rest of the future brat pack actors.You do get a type of Hollywood ending here. Although most of the Wolverines don't survive, we do find out that the USA survives intact and probably eventually wins the war.

In the 1980's, even those of us who hated Reagan, and that was a lot of us, really weren't here to take any s%&t off anybody, most especially those third-world wannabees in Russia. So a movie like this that had a lot more real-world hitting power than say Rambo's BS, was much more like the real thing. First of all, ALL successful guerrilla wars are fought by high-school age or younger fighters; second, there are some way-out moments in this flick that are well worth seeing. Need a lesson on PERSONAL ETHICS? Try out the scene where the cadre finds out one of its number has been going into town and has agreed to swallow a tracking device. Want to know how you treat an adversary after a real-world fight? Try the scene where the cadre captures a Russian soldier who asks about the Geneva Convention. How about brotherly love, which ends the film? The scene where the boys find one of their dads in the concentration camp, can't bust him out and know he'll be killed is spine-chilling. Speaking as a peace loving hippie type, and someone who detested the Reagan Era, this movie worked. In closing, after you've seen this movie, shout with me: WOLVERINES! With due respect this film kicks ass from beginning to end. But the original teaser was incorrect: we were invaded by the British in the War of 1812 and they kicked our asses AND burned the capital and the Japanese inhabited Alaska during WW2.See this movie. It was Ron O'Neal's last major studio film. And look for the line ""Matt! RPG!""",Red Dawn
98,thescholar22,Wolverines!,7,5 October 2019,"Keep hearing about the movie growing up and never really watched it until now. Also, the Homefront games made me want to take a look at this since the movie had the same premise. Freedom fighters against communist forces who invade America, though in that game it's the North Koreans and this movie it's the Russians.When the movie starts it mentions that all the other nations have fallen to the Communists. Then America later gets attacked by Soviet paratroopers in this town somewhere. Some people are able to escape into a national park to see if the fighting dies down. Then after looking around the town, they find out they took some of the kid's parents to these ""Reeducation"" camps. One of the kid's parents goes ""Avenge Me!"" before they get and to be killed.Along the way, some Soviet soldiers go into the park the kids are camping in and the kids end up killing the Soviet soldiers. That ends up making the kids want t fight and become a resistance group to defend America and keep saying ""Wolverines!"" since that was their school's mascot as well.As the movie goes on the freedom fighters struggle a bit and in the end create a spark of hope for America and get a monument for the park they stayed in. This movie seems okay and Patrick Swayze was pretty good for the time. In the remake though the invading enemies were originally Chinese but, made a last minute change to North Koreans as a way not to get rid of chinese movie goers. I might not review the remake since sometimes it doesn't quite feel right or not have the soul the original movie had.",Red Dawn
99,cwbellor,O'er Beautiful Sheen's Spacious Eyes for Swayze Waves of Aks!,9,15 October 2020,"In this moving ode to survival, teenagers head to the hills and become raging Reaganistas! Teen angst has never been better utilized. When crabby Cuban commies invade their homeland, former outsiders Swayze and Howell team up with a pre-tiger blood Sheen to give the Ruskies a badger beatdown. The kids become hill-hopping rebels and before you know it, they are as deadly as that other 80s homegrown group of American killers ...the Children of the Corn. While this film is fond of depicting despair, the biggest tragedy is presented not as the loss of innocence but the loss of good ole' American freedom. Unfortunately, a chorus line of off-key good old boys don't do America's image any favors when they give a horrible rendition of America The Beautiful. The Cubans can't stand this impromptu performance and decide to put them out of their tone-deaf misery. It's sad to witness.",Red Dawn
100,markymark70,Red Dawn??? False Dawn more like....,2,16 January 2009,"I like watching movies and love to write good reviews of movies and Red Dawn was a film that I had missed in its original release back in the 80s. I was looking forward to seeing it. I would have been 14 at the time of release and maybe it would have hit a more resonant nerve if I had seen it at that age - but now it is simply dreadful.In 1983 - The Outsiders - directed by Coppola starred Howell, Swayze and Dalton. It is a fantastic film, a great story, good acting and superb directing. The next year - 1984 - all three combine again in Red Dawn to abysmal results. What happened? The cast for Red Dawn was a good one - Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey adding more youth and Powers Boothe and Harry Dean Stanton providing some experience. But Milius' handling of the script, dialogue, action scenes, sound, everything is terrible.A quick summary of the film's premise is this - soviet troops invade America at the start of WW3. A few teenagers escape to the mountains and wage a guerrilla style attack on the forces over a number of months.What is wrong with this movie?1. The characters. No time is given to their background before the attack starts. And they are so cardboard that they do not even come close to discussing the situation they find themselves in - they simply accept it. Their whole lives change in the blink of an eye and they act as if they are ordering Pepsi because there is no Coke left. 2. The acting. If the characters were poorly developed - the acting was embarrassing. Howell lost all he had gained from The Outsiders within 2 minutes of being on-screen. I blame Milius for this as Howell was great in Outsiders and subsequently great in The Hitcher. In between those films Howell lost out on the Marty McFly part in BTTF and subsequently - lost the franchise to being a very successful actor. All Milius' fault? Maybe not - but seeing as Lea Thompson was in BTTF and in this too - Howell must feel aggrieved. Stanton's 'Avenge me' scene is toe-curdling bad.3. The action scenes. Repetitive scenes of our unknown cast of Brat-Packers wandering around the Rockies blasting everything with a red star. The scenes are slow, tedious and downright boring after the umpteenth scenario. The scandal here is that you can see the amount of money spent on explosions / tanks etc. is quite a lot - but there is zero tension in the build up to these. It is like watching a series of unrelated incidents carried out by a bunch of different people every time. You cannot even make out who is doing what. 4. The Dialogue. The amount of times dreadful lines are delivered by incompetent actors is astounding. Did anyone even read this script beforehand? Sometimes, I thought the editing room was having a laugh - for in some scenes it looks like the kids are not even fully ready for the upcoming scene. Their delivery is abysmal but in truth the words that were on the paper, embarrassingly bad. Boothe's death scene is especially bad. As he is shot through the back and hanging from the turret of a soviet tank - he has to deliver his last words to the kids ""Shoot straight. For a change."" Then he dies. My God, I'd say he was delighted that day to finally get off home with his cheque. Not one to show his grandkids that's for sure.5. The Camera-work. Bar the set-up introductory shots for the changing of the seasons - which consisted of 2 or 3 shots of the Rockies during December, January etc. - the cinematography was downright shoddy. Everything seemed too far away. The camera was too far from the actors to hear what they were saying (the sound obviously re-dubbed on a sound stage afterwards) and to see emotion in their faces. If the audience is not close enough to the actors to feel their emotions - then we cannot identify with them. The whole thing looked like watching a football match from the very highest seat in the stadium.6. The Music. Overbearing, intrusive and dominating every scene it is involved with by beating it down so hard - your ears start to bleed.7. The Plot. The overall premise is not bad but the execution of it terrible. The soviets must have been thick as planks for we learn during the movie that they are on high lookout for our teenage gang - yet they can walk freely among the town, among the soldiers as if they were invisible. Remember, this is a small hick town - not New York - they should be noticed. Where did the Wolerines get all the ammo, guns, RPGs, Claymores, machine guns for their attacks? Okay they got some supplies from Howell's father's shop - a very convenient gun/grocery/camping shop - but do they sell Claymores? I don't think so. It's also hard to swallow the fact that a well organised machine like the Russian army will succumb to a bunch of kids running around the mountains - it just does not ring true. Howell's last stand against the Russian helicopters beggars belief. He is so careful all through the movie not to expose himself but yet decides out of the blue to stand in the open and fire a tiddlywink gun at 2 Russian attack choppers - only to get killed. Why? Too much stuff here to mention but take it on faith that it was bad.All in all a really bad film made by a terrible director. 2/10 - Avoid at all costs.",Red Dawn

I remember seeing it in the theater and feeling myself drawn into the powerful drama on screen.Very believable and highly accurate for its' time, Red Dawn raised awareness that given the proper circumstances, the U.S. could find itself at the mercy of the Soviets and their allies. Anyone who sees this film for the first time now needs to keep in mind the events of the early 1980's in order to put the film in proper perspective.An all-star cast and some great acting really enhanced the strength of the film.",Red Dawn
102,brower8,mediocre even without the dubious premise,3,11 October 2003,"Hardly a movie is easier to despise for its premise. If the idea is to push another Red Scare -- well, at least it's not the dreadful ""Amerika"" miniseries. But it is a silly premise which mars a movie that even without this feature is mediocre at best. A small band of partisans cannot defeat a well-disciplined, ruthless army such as that of the USSR in the early 1980s. They can make life miserable for occupiers, but they are highly unlikely to survive.You can hate this movie for its premises (a political bias), but you must admit that Soviet techniques of overthrowing a country were similar to those in Red Dawn, as was their treatment of any resistance. Note well that the anti-communist resistance ends up using the same techniques of partisan warfare as those that the Soviet partisans used against the Nazis.Would a movie with such a concept as ""Brown Dawn"", in which partisans resisted a nazi invasion have made as much sense? Sure -- and as such one has ""science fiction, category alternative history"", because, mercifully, the Nazis never got a chance to invade America. I can imagine some moonshiners running into trouble with the Gestapo over the smuggling of contraband (including the human sort) out of the occupied Atlantic region, refusing to pay ""occupation taxes"", and keeping their children from attending nazi propaganda mills formerly known as public schools. ""Red Dawn"" must now be relegated to the ""science fiction, alternative history"" category because of its obsolescence as prophecy. All science fiction depends upon suspension of disbelief, which requires esthetic achievement or well-hidden didactic value.>Red Dawn< lacks these qualities altogether and thus fails.",Red Dawn

105,jehaccess6,A view of post Jimmy Carter America.,8,22 December 2007,"This film depicted for me a very conceivable situation if Jimmy Carter had won a second term as President. Under Carter, our strategic posture decayed sufficiently that a desperate Soviet Union would lash out in hopes of staving off collapse from a series of disastrous harvests. The USA was so diminished in stature that NATO countries refused to honor their commitments under the threat of annihilation from the Soviet Union. The ultimate goal was access to the vast grain supplies of Canada and America. Only the British were honorable enough to stand by their commitment and were near collapse under the Soviet onslaught.The Chinese apparently attempted to take advantage of the Soviet preoccupation and suffered the results of a nuclear exchange that greatly weakened the Soviet ability to sustain their invasion forces. All this turmoil allowed the United States to blunt the force of the surprise attack. There are parallels here to the Japanese attack on the US in the Pacific theater in World war 2.The invasion stalled after horrific fighting. Alaska, most of western Canada, and most of the central United States was occupied. A lull in the fighting resulted with both sides trying to buy time to regroup. The invading Soviet/Cuban/Nicaraguan forces in the central United States were cut off and running out of supplies. Note the use of expropriated civilian vehicles by the invaders. The American forces were able to resupply and begin a major offensive near the end of the film. The situation for the invaders was deteriorating and they became ever more frantic and vicious in their efforts to hold on to their gains.The choice of Calumet, Colorado for invasion was due to its strategic location in a pass of the Rocky Mountains. This location was ideal to help block any relief supplies from the still free west coastal region from reaching resistance forces in the central United States. The convoys being ambushed by the Wolverines were attempting to resupply occupation forces fighting to hold their western flank from US counterattacks. The desperate invaders were unable to spare sufficient resources to track down the Wolverines and attempted to use reprisal killings of American civilians to deter further resistance. Only upon the intervention of Colonel Strelnikov was a more aggressive policy implemented. The new policy was becoming more effective and caused the Wolverines to decide that he must be killed regardless of the cost. This triggered the assault that resulted in the death of the Eckert brothers.The success of the Wolverines was due to the nature of their mostly Cuban/Nicaraguan garrison troop opponents. These were conscripted soldiers from a tropical environment thrown into combat in a winter where temperatures could fall to -40 degrees Farenheit. They were fighting people from a totally different cultural background who were far more at home in the local conditions. The Soviet troops were, for the most part, on the front lines facing regular American troops leaving the second-line troops to hold the rear areas. Also, the invaders seemed to have virtually no air power beyond a few helicopters and ground-support jets.The end of the film portrayed a seemingly victorious America that reclaimed all its territory. In such an environment, I would imagine that US troops would soon be taking the fight to Cuba/Nicaragua to avenge their assault on our shores. An enraged America would not be in the mood for forgiveness. The fate of local collaborators would not be pleasant in such an environment.The left-wing opposition to the film was due to its accurate portrayal of what communist forces would eagerly do if within their power. The fellow-travelers in Hollywood would have been among the first to go if the communists ever gained control. I view this film as a reminder of the fate of countries that lose sight of the predatory nature of international relations and the need to remain strong enough to deter attack.",Red Dawn
106,steve-585,Impossible plot with terrible acting,3,27 June 2020,Where do I start? An invasion of the US is impossible. The US is the most heavily armed country in the world.

108,Zod-2,Excellent 80's action/war film,8,3 October 2002,"First off I would like to comment on some of the truly negative comments this films has gotten, especially from Igor-36. This movie was made in 1984 people! It was a sign of the times. The cold war was still going stong. At least this movie took a different approach to the problem and showed conventional warfare and wasn't just another nuke movie. Do these same people watch movies based on WWII and think that America/Britain etc. still hate the Germans and Japanese?One of the big criticisms this movie receives is that a bunch of high school kids couldn't hide out in the mountains and stay hidden from an enemy army. Well, the film does a good job at showing that some of the kids have hunting/survival training and might I point out that as of Oct. 3, 2002 the big bad U.S. Army still hasn't found Bin Ladden! So it is plausible.  Plus, it's not like the enemy army didn't have other fronts to defend.
Is this movie propaganda? Sure, low level propaganda that is, but it's a fun movie that's not supposed to be taken too seriously. I loved this movie when I first saw it back in 1984 and still love it today.  It's got tons of action and a good cast. I think a few people out there need to lighten up and realize that a few years have past since this movie was released.  Red Dawn gets an 8 out of 10.",Red Dawn

111,medic249a2,Not as bad as some say.....,7,20 April 2007,"'Red Dawn' is one of those movies I sometimes feel guilty seeing, but was a product of its time. Though we didn't know it, the Cold War was nearing its end, and the Berlin Wall would be history 5 years later. However, Gorbachev had not yet assumed the Soviet presidency & Americans were still nervous about nuclear war.It begins in Colorado, when a teacher sees paratroops landing on the field of a small high school. When he goes out to investigate, he is savagely gunned down by Soviet soldiers. The soldiers then open fire on the school, sending the students running for cover. A small group, led by Jed (Swayze) & Matt (Sheen) Eckert, head for the mountains with Robert (Howell) & 2 others. After evading Soviet troops, tanks, & aircraft, they reach Robert's dad's store where they pick up camping gear, food & weapons. Escaping into the mountains, they set up camp. 2 days later, they return to the town which is under control of the Soviet Army. They learn the KGB is hunting for them, and after leaving they stop at a family friend's where they learn Robert's dad was murdered by Soviet soldiers who came looking for the guns. They also pick up the man's granddaughters, Toni (Grey) & Erica (Thompson) who are hiding in a cellar after Soviet soldiers tried to rape them. Soon after, a Soviet patrol heads into the highlands where they are hiding out, and the teens encounter them. One soldier goes after Toni in spite of warnings from the other soldiers, and is killed with his own gun. A second soldier runs into Robert, who guns him down, and the third soldier escapes back to his jeep in spite of serious wounds. The young man gasps a warning over the radio, but Jed catches up to him, and the terrified young man looks at Jed then turns away before Jed shoots him at point-blank range. This is the first hint that some in the group are humanizing the soldiers that they killed.When the invasion's commander discovers the dead Soviet soldiers, he orders the town's residents - one of whom is the Eckert boys' dad (Stanton) to dig graves for the dead men, then savagely murders them by firing squad. One of the Eckert boys sees it happen, and they start planning guerrilla-type operations against the Soviet troops. The first involves Toni riding a bike to a fueling station where a Russian tank is being fueled, and when the soldiers take her bag it contains a grenade which kills the tank's driver. As Toni runs across an open field with the tank's crew on her heels, 3 of the boys pop up out of foxholes & gun down the men. Encouraged by their success, they continue with others, the most notable of which is an attack on a firing squad. As Russian soldiers & their C.O. line up civilians for the firing squad, the officer gives the command to aim - and then suddenly the entire firing squad is cut down by the 'Wolverines', allowing the civilians to escape.In the dead of winter, they find a new ally in Lt-Col. Andrew Tanner (Boothe) of the U.S.A.F. Tanner, an F-15 pilot, had destroyed 4 of 5 Soviet MiG fighters before being shot down. With a military man in their midst, they find out about the extent of the invasion & Col. Tanner begins helping them plot new guerrilla operations, including rescuing political prisoners from the so-called 're-education' camps.Soviet Colonel Strelnikov (William Smith) is brought in to hunt down the 'Wolverines' & eliminate them, but his plans soon go awry after one of his soldiers is captured & killed by the Wolverines, and an attempt to hunt them down with MiL-Mi24 helicopter gunships fails. By now, the enraged Col. Bella (O'Neal) has become disillusioned with the invasion & plans to return home to his wife in Cuba. General Bratchenko, the Russian officer in charge of the invasion, is killed in a raid by Matt & Jed. Colonel Strelnikov manages to fatally wound both Matt & Jed, but is ambushed & killed by Jed while searching for Matt. When he spots Matt & Jed, both mortally wounded, Bella points his AK-47 at him, but decides not to shoot. Perhaps now both sides have begun to see each other as humans, not so different from each other.Though a Soviet invasion in this way would have been near-impossible, it was a chilling alternative to 'The Day After', which basically portrayed a nuclear wasteland. 'Red Dawn' presented an equally chilling possibility to Americans - living under the iron fist of a Soviet communist dictatorship where the KGB ran your life, and the realization that insurgents could force something as powerful as the Soviet Army to retreat. Not a bad movie at all.",Red Dawn
112,stiv-7,Jingoistic? Maybe.,6,18 December 2001,"I sat down and watched this for the first time in 16 years, and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's bloody. Yes, it's violent. Yes, the cast is not all on the same playing field, but the message of the film is exceedingly simple: Don't get complacent.Some of the film is a little chilling in light of Sept. 11, but there's enough silliness to keep you from getting too depressed. 1. You can laugh at the clothes, 2. You can laugh at the dialogue, and 3. You can laugh at how homely they managed to get Jennifer Grey and Lea Thompson to look. Also, keep in mind that this is from the screenwriter of Magnum Force and Apocalypse Now, and the screenwriter/director of Dillinger and Conan the Barbarian. Kevin Reynolds wrote the original screen story, which was supposed to be a sort of preteen Lord of the Flies type scenario (which would have been interesting, but we'll never know how it would have turned out; oh wait, there was that horrible remake of LOTF in 1989), and has since gone on to such illustrious classics as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and the unforgettable Waterworld.Now that you know what you're getting yourself into, throw yourself in with wild abandon and enjoy yourself watching the antics of a gun-happy (yes) C. Thomas Howell, his hunting expert buddies, and the whiny kids who just happened to come along for the ride. Don't worry; they're disposed of in an appropriate manner. Enjoy the low budget constraints of substituting New Mexico for Colorado, and a surprisingly sympathetic Cuban communist leader. Just don't take any of this too seriously. It can't stand up to that kind of scrutiny. The guerilla raids of the ""Wolverines"" are sometimes laughably implausible, but it doesn't matter. Plausibility went out the window on this one.",Red Dawn
113,The Bronson Fan,Cold warriors our great hour has arrived!,10,24 November 2004,"Well the Soviets finally managed to invade America with the help of some Cuban commies and now a small group of teenagers start a guerrilla force to fight for their country. Using commercial airlines the Soviets drop in and occupy parts of America in the start of WW III. Brothers Jed Eckert (Patrick Swayze) and Matt (Charlie Sheen) leave their small town with some friends and deiced not to run but to wage a guerrilla war against the Soviet occupation. Calling themselves the ""Wolverines"" the Soviets soon find that they are dealing with real Americans and cant handle the patriotic force unleashed on them. The reds call in Col.

In the final battle the Brothers lead one final attack against there base Killing the Colonel and die heroes. This movie although it is complete fantasy is still a great war film for the Reagan cold warrior or anyone who grew up with the Rambo movies. Surprisingly acted well for a movie that you would think is just another action film. The kids, though looking a little old for the role, go from being young adults to people who must fight for there right to survive in their own land. Well acted by Sawyze though I still think Sheen needs some work on his acting. With a pretty large cast of future stars, Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. William Smith as always is the king of Tough guys, but I feel wasn't used enough in this movie. John Milius of course is the man and directs another great film that will be remembered for an interesting take on the cold war. Fans of Rambo should love this. Same sound effects, costumes, and fake soviet vehicles are used. The movie is not without its flaws. Soviet union was really a joke and could never have invaded North America and the US Would have nuked them of the face of the planet had they launched anything. I'm sure the liberals of course hated this movie, which makes it all the better.

115,sublime501,Okay war movie.,5,17 July 2004,"RED DAWN is set in the time of war, when the Soviet Union takes over the United States. When they capture many of the parents of one city's youth, the teenagers band together to fight back against the Soviets and try to win their country back. The teenagers' unofficial leader is Jed (Patrick Swayze), whose brother is Matt (Charlie Sheen). Other members of the guerrilla squad are Robert (C. Thomas Howell), and Erica (Lea Thompson) and Toni (Jennifer Grey), two girls picked up from friends to keep custody of. In such a rough time as war--how will they all survive?Let me start off my critique by saying that the plot is absolutely ridiculous. The Soviet Union invading America? Okay. The soldiers capturing parents and leaving teenagers alone on their own? Fine. But those teenagers forming a GUERRILLA army to fight the Soviets? It's unbelievably unrealistic. You can't even fathom any possible way that this could happen. Other than that--the script is awful except for a few great one-liners (most of them given to the character of Robert). The movie is much too long and gets incredibly boring after a while. But, there's some good in everything...A few of the scenes in RED DAWN are incredibly powerful. The opening sequence of the soldiers sailing down onto the school campus is amazing, and I'll never be able to forget the scene where the boys are driving away in the truck and one of their fathers is left behind. The boy shouts, ""Papa! Papa!"" And the father is calling out to his son, but the soldiers get him before the boy can. That's heart-wrenching stuff right there. Also, after Jed and Matt see their father in the military camp, and basically any scene involving the teenagers' parents, is great. It's very touching and relatable, as well as the fact that is displays some fine acting. The acting is pretty good for the most part, but the actors really aren't given a lot to work with. The action scenes are all pretty great, but unfortunately more of the focus is on the characters, which, in this case, is insanely boring.RED DAWN is an okay war movie. If it had instead focused on the characters and them coping with the loss of their parents, that would have been a good movie, given that the elements I described were continued. But instead, this ridiculous plot is thrown in and drawn out. By the end, I really didn't care what happened to the characters. There's a couple of good displays of great acting (C. Thomas Howell in particular does very well, playing the best character in my opinion), and the action scenes are good--but this probably won't interest most people. 5/10.",Red Dawn
116,jpcjcpd,The cost of war,8,22 October 2021,"One of the main things missing from most reviews is the view of the toll war takes and the human element. One of the most prophetic lines from the movie describing why this is occurring is ""maybe someone just forgot what it is like.""Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it propaganda? No. Does it accurately show what communist regimes always seem to do to oppress their people? Yes. Does it portray the Russian/Cubans as evil caricatures? No.This movie does a good job of capturing the effect of killing and combat on a group of young teens. They progress from regular teens to partisans, which has happened countless times in history. Yes, the acting is less than stellar. But the movie does capture how both sides have humanity, lose their humanity piece by piece and even the potential for redemption and conscience. If you don't see that with the colonel and one kid lost to hate, then you missed the point. The point is similar to War Games: the only winning move is not to play.As for the politics, this situation is realistic ONLY with the alternate history that is covered in the opening sequence.

This movie worked for me because its characters worked for me.It deals with an impossible situation, an invasion of the United States by Soviet backed forces and the inevitable resistance by Americans.  The movie is totally politically incorrect.  In setting up the scenario the producers studied the USSR and its manner of operation and came up with the only plausible Soviet invasion of the US. It is roughly based on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which occurred in 1979.The characters themselves are realistic, and the movie treats the invaders are real human being.

There is something wrong here.Red Dawn may look like just some war movie first sight. It's actually about the importance of family and fighting for that family. The movie's spectacular theme motivates the film and the movie turns out to be superb.It is your average school day. History class. A very boring class. However, for this class it won't be boring. Paratroopers drop from the sky and begin shooting them all. The scene is very disturbing but very realistic. That could happen to any of us.As the movie moves on, a group of teenagers whose families have disappeared after the raid, they hide in the woods and form a brotherhood known as ""The Wolverines"". The movie depicts the violence of war and how invasions are actually played out. The attacks they use are just plain awesome and unlike other war movies, this movie is actually not afraid to kill off many of its main characters. The emotion raised from betrayal, death, and just striving to live to see their families is very overwhelming to the point where you are emotionally disturbed and saddened.The extraordinary movie is only enhanced by the performances. All of the stars of the film actually give incredible performances, and their stardom doesn't get in the way. This is what movies are about.5.6? Pop the movie into your DVD player, watch it, read this review, and maybe you'll realize how spectacular this film is. 9.5/10",Red Dawn
120,Tolbert,Highly underrated and way ahead of it's time!,10,11 September 2001,"The tragic events of today (most unfortunately) prove that the premise of this movie is NOT far fetched. Those who are offended by this movie should watch the news. Although the circumstances are different, they do bare some eerie similarities. If New York could have lost so many lives in one day by a group of terrorists, why does it seem so unlikely that Guerrillas from two different countries could do the same or worse damage. Can you believe that people protested this movie? Why? John Milius dared to do something different, it was a strong plot and good actors/actresses. It's easy for anti-N.R.A. types to say that the movie was awful but that must be because they don't understand it or are in denial about certain political agendas to take guns away from average people. Regardless of that, it isn't about that. What's so unbelievable about human survival? Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey all give great performances. The horrible events of today prove that tragedy like we saw on every news channel, tragedy of unthinkable proportions can happen. Rent this film!",Red Dawn
121,sugar_daddyo,More firepower than the entire 82nd,4,9 May 2007,"Wolverines pack a punch even after crying on each others' shoulders from missin' their mamas. Despite the high melodrama and hairstyles, Red Dawn reflects the tension of the times. However, the treatment is less than memorable alongside similar classics like WarGames. I had completely forgotten about this film until it recently popped up on cable unexpectedly. Unlike WarGames which has a nice balance of humor alongside the rather overt message, Red Dawn tries very hard to make us believe the good 'ol US of A has become another Russian occupied Afghanistan. My guess is there were Washington fear mongers who thought the plot was plausible, if not at least discussed it. However, the Russians eventually lost their Vietnam and retreated from Afghanistan five years later followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union.Maybe that's why Red Dawn is mostly irrelevant today like most Cold War era films. The premise seemed far-fetched at the time, and in our post-Cold War era seems closer to science fiction than fact.",Red Dawn
122,jthaule,well shaped propaganda piece,9,31 May 2018,"As propaganda artists go John Milius is up there with Eisenstein and Riefenstahl. In terms of right wing paranoia in the eighties this film is not only the perfect showcase specimen, it is also full of desirable teenage heart throb actors making the paranoia so much more relatable to the average movie goer.Technically speaking the film is a testament to a perfectionistic preoccupation with the Soviet union as the enemy. Rarely will you see a film from the eighties with actual Soviet weaponry (usually you'll see Chinese copies, such as in Rambo) or this attention to detail.
And as far as the plot is concerned, it might seem ridiculous today given that we know perfectly well that the Soviet Union was collapsing from within at the time the film was made, however this film is based on contemporary strategic analysis from various US defence and intelligence institutions.One often overlooked aspect of this film, as well as Milius' other efforts, is that while the film is certainly pro war, pro guns and masculine to the point of being kitsch is that war is realistically portrayed as having human costs. psychological trauma, death and suffering is integral to the story, and never glossed over.While this film is far from my own political views, it's truly a masterpiece and deserves attention as a diorama of a prolific world view in the eighties.",Red Dawn
123,mullermike,"8 kids taking on half of the red army, oh ya",10,1 June 2005,"Are there eight kids fighting or six? I can't remember. Either way, this flick rocks (I'll even say it RAWKS). I guess the ""Soviets"" knew they couldn't take on the US armed forces, so they decided to take on soft targets, like public schools. Little did they know that this particular junior college was Swayze Crazy.POSSIBLE SPOILERS ************* Oh man, where do we begin with this one? I guess you could say it's a tale of survival, as the Commies try to penetrate into the heart of the fine US public school system. Of course, this flick was made a few years before it was common to have firearms in schools, so these kids were totally defenseless against this surprise attack. Good thing they outsmarted the Ruskies and confiscated some of their munitions , which they in turn successfully used against them. Maybe kids are learning something in the public schools after all.MORE SPOILERS **********Not only did these teens (or in Swayzes case, 30 year high schoolers) fight valiantly, they fought victoriously. There were some losses along the way, but hey, you're gonna take some hits when you're taking on half the Red Army. This however, begs a peculiar question: why was our country so scared of the Soviet Union if they couldn't even take over a high school? They conquered the actual building, but they let some of the students slip away, which ultimately did them in. These kids truly were heroes, as they fled into the woods, stayed the course, and fought back, even as the Soviets exported the fine art of the firing squad onto US soil, taking out Harry Dean Stanton along the way. Quite harrowing.I know I'm taking a sardonic tone, but this film's premise, though timely in 1984, is so ridiculous. It may hit home to some, especially when the US and Russia were a click of a button away from going nuclear (not pronounced NUKE YU LIR). But this film has to be taken for what it is, pure drivel. Yes, quite enjoyable, but so many of these reviewers took the movie seriously, gimme a break!!! I absolutely love this movie, it's completely over-the-top, great Cold War propaganda and unintentionally hysterical. It's almost as ridiculous as the later Death Wish films, 3-5 to be exact, though I think Charles Bronson may have had a higher body count. There is plenty of violence and gun-play to go around, so it may be too strong for the faint of heart. However, this movie has aged like white bread, so some of the excess shooting and fighting seems tame by todays standards. And frankly, if you find the fighting disturbing, you're either a peacenik or a plain coward. The director of this flick is a gun lover (God bless him), so expect to see plenty of firearms.",Red Dawn

I can't remember if it was my boyfriend at the time or me who selected it, but likely was the boyfriend because I despise war movies and violence.Nevertheless, this movie grabbed my attention and held it throughout. When paratroopers descend on an American high school, you care! The efforts of these kids and their parents to resist the invasion really hit close to home, so for those like me who are turned off by a premise like this, give it a shot. It will probably engage you.I cared about the characters throughout the film, and you will too, because they are pretty well developed for an action film.This film is the first time Patrick Swayze came to my attention, and I'm re-watching this film today to honor him, because I just found out he'd passed away in 2009 from pancreatic cancer. :(There's beautiful scenery, and I promise that even for war haters like me, it will activate your sense of patriotism and make you root for the defenders of the invasion.Oh, and please don't waste your time on the remake. I've seen it, and IMHO and the opinions of thousands of IMDb participants it is NOT as good.I also watched ""Letters From A Killer"" with Patrick Swayze starring, because I hadn't seen it before, and that's worth your time too.",Red Dawn
126,jeffchan,"Fun, disturbing, thought-provoking; a great film",10,22 August 1999,"Red Dawn was written during the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan.  It asks what it would be like to have Soviet, Cuban and Nicaraguan troops invading the Southwestern United States.  How would it feel for Americans to be attacked as the Afghans were?The story weaves elements of past wars and a possible future (circa 1984) limited war.  Cuban expansion into Nicaragua, Soviet Hind-D attack helicopters strafing horseback Afghan rebels, Communist revolution in Mexico, America's counterinsurgency (counter-revolutionary) war in Vietnam form the main themes of this war.  The film proposes that as technology inevitably breaks down due to the grind of battle, war degrades into combat on an individual or squad level.  Red Dawn hints at the horrifying cost of war to the general civilian population due to nukes, siege and starvation. It shows the monsterous measures totalitarian conquerers use to suppress captured civilians.  The latter is hardly fantasy.  It happened repeatedly in the 20th century and goes on today in places like Burma, Serbia, Rwanda, etc.Director John Milius indirectly criticizes U.S. conduct in Vietnam through Cuban Commander Bella's awakening conscience. Bella was himself a guerilla fighting just revolutions against corrupt governments.  In this war he finds himself literally in the other camp, brutally crushing the grassroots resistance and often non-resistance of the local people.  At first he laments becoming a mere policeman.  He eventually realizes he has become something he despises: an oppressor of the common people.The heroes of the film, a cast of young stars who will go on to lead countless movies, show the American spirit that created our country and helped saved the world from fascist and communist domination at least twice this century.  They barely have the tools they need to survive but adapt and bring the war back to the enemy.If you believe bigger government is the answer to all problems and would not fight to defend your country or your freedom, you probably won't like this film.  If you can put aside your biases and consider for a moment what it would be like to have your country invaded by a modern, well-equipped, and ruthless army, you may find yourself enjoying this film as much as I do.",Red Dawn
127,bobbyhollywood,War comes to the states,8,25 August 2010,"I guess I am easy to please, I enjoyed every bit of this movie, no - not the killing etc, but the story and the way it was presented. The actors all did their jobs and earned every penny they got paid. I am sorry to say, that the DVD you can get in the stores is NOT exactly the same film we saw in the movies/television, nope, some things have been added, and some taken out. I found this out after I gave away the DVD I had recorded from Cable - oh well. Do the additions/subtractions make a difference, to me they do. In one scene of the original first time I saw this movie, a solder bring their commander his uniform on a hanger, and says ""tu uniforma,"" and the commander takes it. In the DVD I bought from the store, that don't happen at all, no uniform, and no line for the actor. As well as other things.Sorry to say, I have noticed this same thing on DVD's of other movies, not all of course.The actor who plays the History Teacher in the opening, does a very fine job of getting your attention, then taking you along with him as he goes outside.In the 1940's I saw a movie ""China's Little Devils,"" and Red Dawn reminded me of it, it is still one of my favorites.

I was not prepared to like this movie starting out. I saw things like, ""Commies are the devil"" and ""Boys shouldn't cry"" and ""Here boys, protect these girls"" and ""Murrica is awesome and of course we will win."" But as the movie went on, it pleasantly surprised me. The boys in the group still showed emotional vulnerability. The girl characters became just as capable in combat as the boys. The young freedom fighters representing America experienced many triumphs, but also a lot of grief and suffering. Even the Communist villains showed signs of humanity, particularly towards the end. Though this movie appears to be a pro-American propaganda piece playing on a prevalent fear in the 80's, it is actually an emotional drama that shows a young group of people as they cope with trauma and struggle to survive in a hellish landscape. It is a work of art and should be treated as such.",Red Dawn

The year of this film's release is indeed pertinent, in 1984, the u.s was still in the midst of the cold war and the leader of the free world at the time was a avid movie buff and ex Hollywood actor himself: Mr Ronald Reagan. Whilst an interesting concept, the idea of injecting mainstream movies with political rhetoric means you run the risk of alienating a large portion of your potential audience, who just want to.escape reality for a couple of hours and have some fun. 'red dawn' saving grace in this regard, is that it's political charged premise is so mind numbingly silly, that nobody is likely to let it affect their enjoyment of this fun action romp. Hollywood has subsequently carried on making both teen movies , action movies and teen action movies but had stopped combining the two with politics.

So a group of high schoolers high tail it to a store owned by one of the lads' fathers, which conveniently sells guns, ammo, and camping supplies. And inevitably, the teenagers wind up fighting the invaders to the end. Campy acting, cheesy dialogue, and a plot too illogical to ignore ruin much of the movie, but it's harmless as a way to spend two hours. The highlight character is the realistically distraught lead Cuban invader. Overall, ""Red Dawn"" is a hasty warning to American citizens, disguised as an action flick, at the heyday of the Cold War.

133,peter-bruck,Confessions of a Socialist,1,12 April 2009,"First of all; this movie is a bore. Normally you're around 20 minutes into a movie before the main plot starts. screen writers use this time to establish the main characters, their way of life, what they are like etcetera... this movie starts right after the credits with the invasion and it doesn't stop till the end (the movies lasts for 2 hours!!!). Maybe this sounds awesome now, but unfortunately it's nothing else then one cliché action scene arbitrarily added on the next. The only remotely thrilling scene is the one where the kids hide from a soviet patrol behind some rocks and get caught. And could somebody tell me how the kids were able to mutate into rebel soldiers?Just by playing in the woods? There's one more thing that I can't ignore regarding the other reviews: the politics of the movie. So please allow me one question: RD is about a high school football team fighting off the soviet invasion, right? Am I a communist because I think that's stupid???? Some said Red Dawn wouldn't dehumanize the Russians. Doesn't the movie start with soviet soldiers shooting young high school students? (I have to add; these students were actually unarmed, unlike these days). Isn't that at least a little one-sided?

As a result of that, and the rather choppy transitions between scenes, this film has the feel of an aborted TV miniseries sliced and spliced into a cinematic clip show. The crew probably should've gone the route of the then-popular invasion series V instead: it would've done the plotting and characterisation wonders!Nice concept; clumsy execution.

Patrick Swayze, as Jed, Charlie Sheen, as Matt, C. Thomas Howell, as Robert, and Jennifer Grey, as Toni, really stand out. It was clearly one of Grey's best roles. They all showed real potential that harkened to their later careers as actors. This is a real war movie that keeps you guessing and routing for the Wolverines.

136,wesperkins,Millenialls wont get this movie but it's still great,10,25 August 2017,"I have seen so many reviews who think the plot is ridiculous and the message is bad. Anyone who thinks it was ridiculous was born after 1990 I guarantee. At the time, it was not far fetched, but most kids today say ""who cares about when it was released, it's stupid to me"". How naive. Please don't comment on things you know nothing about. This was not far fetched at the time. It was a huge stretch, but not impossible. I don't comment on the plausibility of movies in the 60's, so please do not judge movies that were released before you were born. You don't know me, but trust me, this was not far fetched in 1984. Now I am sure people think we were just idiots if we think this was possible, but again, if you were not alive then, you have no clue what it was like then, so please just shut up. I know most on the left are used to movies that make war out to be horrible, and guess what? So does this one. While it's patriotic, it also shows the enemy as human, and war is fruitless. But it also shows it's OK to love your country. I don't know why so many hate this movie, simply because there is a love of country. Yes it's over the top. But it seems that most movies from Hollywood with war must show how bad America is and how bad war is to be considered ""good"". Sorry it shows people will fight for America. Unfortunately, this movie seeems to fall into the left hates it and the right loves it. It is so much more than that. Your politics will decide if you like this it seems, but try and get past that, and enjoy this. It is a deep movie with multiple messages. You will want to fight for America after this if it comes to that, but you will also pray for peace. Too bad so many just use their political views to judge this movie, because it has something for both sides and it really is a wonderful movie if you can move past picking apart a few unlikely scenarios.

Yet there's still the matter of the flat-out bad acting and a horribly written script. I must admit that the first few times I saw ""Red Dawn"" I enjoyed it, but I soon outgrew campy films. A poor career move for all the actors involved(though most of them went on to have one big hit and then just disintegrated; Jennifer Grey's ""Dirty Dancing,"" Charlie Sheen's ""Wall Street"" and possibly ""Platoon,"" and Lea Thompson's...uh...help me out here...) --Bud Sturguess, Texas",Red Dawn
138,huladog55,Bravo Milius!,10,23 January 2006,"Bravo Milius! I vividly remember seeing this movie when I was 10 years old living in Washington, D.C.. As a military brat, I was obsessed by all things military, but also keenly aware of the global political state of the world. Reagan ruled supreme, and a succession of weak Politburo puppets lived and died in the Kremlin. The mid-80's was a scary time for many.It's easy twenty years later to dismiss the premise of Red Dawn as overblown and unrealistic. How things have changed since 1984.Many reviewers have criticized this film for major plot holes and inconsistencies. I offer that these people have not actually viewed and absorbed the story elements portrayed by Red Dawn and John Milius.1. It was clearly stated in the beginning of the film that the Soviet economy was suffering from back to back poor grain harvests. This is what triggered the attack on NATO and then the United States. Hungry people get desperate.2. Nuclear weapons were used on strategic sites to disable key military installations and infrastructure. Many readers do not understand that since the 'invaders' would want to preserve the ""Bread Basket"" of the country, they wouldn't necessarily use tactical nuclear weapons. Battlefield nukes with small yields are strong enough to decimate with precision. They exist, but have never been used in combat.3. The ""Wolverines"" were not acting alone. ""Radio Free America"" showed this. It was demonstrated in the movie that resistance was taking place all over the country. The U.S. has over 73,000,000 men of 'fighting age'. An enemy aims a gun at your home or family, show me one of those 75,000,000 who would not take up arms in defense.4. The enemy used commercial airliners to invade the U.S. It's been done before. A bit of a stretch, but this is presented as fiction.Some cheesy dialogue? Sure. Continuity problems? Maybe. Preachy? Sometimes, but this is a film of good over evil. Believable casting of teenagers. Sometimes wooden, sometimes moving, aren't people that way in real life? Spineless European 20-somethings and the like say that this is just another example of American imperialism. I'd say ask your grandparents if they feel the same way as America sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives to save your shores, while we were in no immediate danger.

I wonder if he ever watched it?  I am a sucker for a unique concept as long as the film holds my interest from start to finish.  Red Dawn is about the U.S. under siege from Russians and Cubans.  The movie is set away from the main battle lines and the young students are engaging in guerilla warfare.  Then as now, the idea is pretty much beyond belief.  So what, this movie rocks.  And remember, the operative word is U.S. under siege.  This remains a real possibly given such weapons of mass destruction, including anthrax and van size nuclear devices. The key to enjoying this film is to disengage your political beliefs and appreciate film making at its finest.  Loads of action, escapism and patriotism.

You can feel the emotions from the characters. The performances in this movie were incredibly powerful. Charlie Sheen, C Thomas Howel, and Patrick Swayze gave some of the best performances in their carriers.

141,TwoThirdsMajority,"Red Dawn, Stupid but Awesome Movie!!",8,14 November 2005,"Red Dawn was the Harry Potter of the 80's. But it's a different type of a Harry Potter film. It's a film where Ak47s and machine guns are wands, helicopters and MiGs as broomsticks, Colorade High School students as Hogwarts students, Nicaraguan soldiers as Slytherins, Cuban soldiers as Death Eaters and Russians as followers of Lord Voldemort.If you don't know what the hell Red Dawn is, then i'll explain it to you: Imagine if you're a dork who studies in a high school and gets teased by guys and girls cooler than you, and then one day a group of communist soldiers land and invade your country, then you run into the woods with a bunch of friends and guys cooler than you, then you create a gang, name it after your school mascot and then kick the commies a** until they leave your country and then: freedom! Yes, i know it sounds stupid, but it does make sense. Red Dawn was an awesome movie. Charlie Sheen and Patrick Swayze played Jed Eckert and Matt Eckert, which resembles Harry Ron, while Jennifer Grey plays the chick that also has a more Hermione-styled but with a femme-fatale thing going on. It's more like 2 guys and one girl kicking a** (Just like Star Wars and HP).The script was good. John Milius, who wrote Apocalypse Now, gave a good script for the movie. Although it has some flaws, it's still a good script. A liberal with a NRA ownership, Milius gave us a movie that makes us think.......very deeply................so deep..........that it makes you.............wanna take marijuana and smoke it.The acting was good, but only on the Wolverines (Americans, that is). Charlie Sheen, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer were terrific, although the Soviets acted like complete morons who don't know what the hell AK47 is.The Cold War seems to be over, but the threat of a communist country invading your country is not.

Although he's not Al Pacino his character transforms from one man in the beginning to another at the end similar to Michael Corleone in The Godfather.

143,Stanjaudit,This Could Happen,7,15 March 2013,Red Dawn may be a fantasy but unless you head is stuck in the sand the events leading up to the invasion of the USA could actually happen. It did at Pearl Harbor and the Aleutians in WWII. It also occurred 9/11/2001. So to discount the events portrayed in Red Dawn as some Hollywood Fantasy is one thought but Hollywood could also be portraying events that could take place and give us food for thought. Red Dawn is actually a strong movie with a well written script and a strong cast. Patrick Dempsey and Jennifer Grey later teamed together in the movie Dirty Dancing. Powers Boothe added a strong cast member and although an adult did not replace Jed as leader of the Wolverines. The Wolverines were the ones that were the thorn in the side of KGB and Russian soldiers. As Lea Thompson so vividly points out at the end of the movie she never saw the brothers again but came often to partisan rock where children put the names of their comrades who had died so this nation would not die in vain.,Red Dawn

It reminded me of Lord of the Flies the way ordinary youth were dealing with extraordinary circumstances. Some of the characters adapted to this survival at all costs better than others. The casting and script was smart for this type of picture. Howell got a taste for killing and hungered for more. Thompson played a hardened woman who was also game for warfare. Swayze was the leader and was conflicted; at the beginning he was gung ho but as the movie wore on his conscious caught up with him. I enjoyed seeing the reaction of war veteran Powers Booth to the characters. To me this film was very thoughtful and did not glorify the violence. It was actually quite disturbing and made me wonder if the better fate was to die or survive such an event.,Red Dawn

During the evening of the first attack at Calumet we see Col. Bella ordering a Russian officer to obtain forms 4473 from the gun stores. This is the form everyone who purchases a gun is required to fill out and sign. This later leads to all of the ""trouble makers"" i.e. gun owners, being rounded up and sent to the ""re-education camp"".

But it's also a predictable Eighties action movie, and a rather dumb one to boot.High school kids, half a dozen or so, survive the Soviet-Cuban invasion of Wyoming and take to the hills as guerrilla fighters. I gave a vague number, because director John Milius never convincingly distinguished between any of the characters; I couldn't keep track of who was who or what their names were, so that when several of them inevitably died tragic deaths, I could only react by asking, ""Which one was that?""The story is a great celebration of brainless macho posturing. The kids' leader bullies them and threatens them when they express any emotion, and Milius portrays their transformation into killing machines without any trace of irony or self-awareness. He's already stripped them of their individuality, but his only goal seems to be to create violent fight scenes, and not any sort of commentary on the dehumanizing effects of war. The fight scenes, or action scenes or whatever the aficionados prefer to call them, are elaborately staged, with helicopters, tanks, rockets, and lots of exploding stunt men. They also manage to make the trained Soviet soldiers look like morons, while the plucky American youngsters perform like steely Red Berets. The overwhelming focus on the action ensures that the movie will never be taken seriously, because the characters are allowed no emotional life, and the real consequences of guerrilla violence are avoided -- the brutal reprisals, the collateral civilian deaths, the moral compromises.Cheesy Eighties action movies can be fun, but ""Red Dawn"" is too exploitative for that. It misses all the opportunities it had for thoughtful commentary or provocative insights, and instead just stages a bunch of generic shootouts.",Red Dawn
148,Tirdun,Lost in what-if land,2,23 January 2003,"I'd heard about Red Dawn (mythos of ""most bullets ever"" and such) and watched it on TBS or TNT or whatever. Hated it. Now, I enjoy a good what-if scenario as much as the next guy. I enjoy reading WWII books about ""what if xxxx had died in 1943"" or ""what if the Germans had built a jet"", but in order for any scenario like this to work, there has to be SOME semblance of possibiltiy. You can suspend disbelief only so far and believe me, this one stretches disbelief into whole new and ridiculous shapes, then it lights it on fire and dances around the ashes.So, Russia invades middle-America through Mexico?!? What, were the radar and satellite guys asleep during the buildup and invasion? Do you know how many military bases there are in Texas? Do you know how much firepower sits at sea RIGHT NOW? Given the unlikely scenario of attacking the US from the middle, the entire US Atlantic and Pacific fleets are sitting like a hammer and anvil ready to pound this mythical Russian/South American army into dust! YEESH! Logic failing. Losing mind.Ok, movies don't always have to make sense, I'll just sit back and watch a kill-the-alien or similar mess with a big smile and a beer without picking it apart. Howerver, what little ignore-the-facts rah-rah potential this movie has is swamped by the unbelievable premise, followed by the unbelievable storyline that the US military (and UK, and Canada, and etc) couldn't muster a worthy retaliation for years. Add to that the inept Russian troops, who can't seem to defend themselves in a scenario that they are trained to handle while a bunch of high-school kids rough it in the mountains with their complex weaponry and USA-USA-USA spirit. Drek. Pure Drek.The whole thing boils down to a political cartoon against gun registration. If you note in the early stages where the Russian COL orders a subordinate to gather all the registration forms from the local hunting store, and the proceedes to confiscate said guns. Our ""heroes"" however, manage to scrounge up some guns'n'ammo and fight back! WOO! Boy if they ever pass those gun registration laws and Russia invades us we can't say we weren't warned! I'm not going to go all pro-NRA or anti-gun here, but the message in this movie is a load. 2/10 for a few watchable scenes.",Red Dawn
149,electronicparty,Highly Underrated,10,17 May 2010,"This is by far one of the best all time war movies of all time. It's low budget and gritty. It doesn't glamorize war. It makes war out to be what war is, it's a dirty rotten business with no winners. In war there is no winners or losers, it's just survival. It's kill or be killed, it's live or die. I was impressed with the movie. I was impressed by it's realism.I think any solider would watch this and feel it to be an accurate depiction of what guerrilla warfare is all about. I didn't feel there were any big gaps of logic or leaps of faith. The characters in most regards behaved and reacted as I would if I were in their situation. Killing another human being is never easy, until you watch the enemy kill your family or friends. Then it becomes really easy and it gets easier and easier the more you do it. To the place and point you don't even feel anything anymore. A wounded enemy is begging for his life and you walk up and shoot him in the head without hesitation. That's the difference between a real warrior and you and I sitting at home.Real warriors turn off their emotions and become killing machines. These kids in the movie became killing machines. They retained some of their humanity but over all they became warriors and fought courageously to the death. They became better than their enemy.",Red Dawn
150,markjayaweera,Terrible film but does have a good soundtrack from Basil Poleidouris,3,20 December 2019,"I agree fully with the film review commenter here Markmark70. Now don't get me wrong. Its no exeggaration that to me the 1980s was my favourite decade. Its one of the few decades in history. Where there was great music, great movies, interesting and nice fashions. Ok people might not agree with me on this. But people actually dressed well and sharply in this decade like they did in the 1930s or 40s,50s. They took a keen interest in their appearance. Hence the many interesting hairstyles of men and women. But they were stylish and never looked naff or downright embarrassing like the hair styles and dress fashions of the early to med 1970s etc for example.That said there were some annoying things about the 1980s. Like annoying blatant right wing propaganda movies like these. Badly made, Badly acted which made no deep points accept that they blame and hate the Russians becuase look how evil they are. Come to think of it the Mainstream media is doing the same again in the 21st century the last 10 years as a new cold war has been brewing again in the last decade or so with Putin in power. I thought the cold war ended in 1991. Ok there was a cold war going on between east and west in the early to mid 1980s. Still they could have made a more thoughtful movie. This movie was just blame dumb from start to finnish. I did like to see a young Charlie Sheen, Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey and Lea Thompson but they have been given a bad script and a terrible directed movie which made little sense. The handsom 80s young couple Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey did redeem themselves 3 years later from this disaster of a propaganda movie by acting in the thoroughly harmless and enjoyable 80s flick Dirty Dancing.
I would have given this movie 1 star but for the very good soundtrack by Basil Poledouris. One thing the 1980s never let you down in is the music and sound department it always delivered.",Red Dawn

Not even a year later, I began to see just how dumb this movie really was from the dialogue: ""...waking up with their throats cut...""; to the editing (I learned that the raid on the airbase that the jet fighter that exploded five times was supposed to be MULTIPLE fighters...Just looked like the same one blowing up five different times); to the story structure. If there was an invasion, the Soviets wouldn't of done it conventionally. Not since they had nuclear power-- this wasn't Afghanistan, for peet's sake!My father was a technical advisor on this movie and was very proud of it. To him, there ""were no boring parts"". But in fact, it was boring. And it was painful to watch fine actors such as Patrick Swayze, Powers Booth and Harry Dean Stanton in this mess; the plot and the events were a bit incoherent, as well as the action (see above); and the ""climax"" between Swayze and the Russian colonel was ridiculous! Just the other day, my girlfriend heard the word, ""Wolverine"" and asked if I ever saw this. I grimaced and said yes. She replied, ""oh, that was sooo good!"" I was hoping that she was going to mention, ""X-Men"". That was certainly better than this!But at least my dad would love her as a daughter-in-law!",Red Dawn

156,dougmcnair,Propaganda . . . but whose?,1,10 February 2011,"I saw this in-theater when it was released in '84. It began with a quick back story flashed on-screen in bullet-point format, and once that was done I could tell it was going to be really, really bad. It did not prove me wrong.I couldn't tell whether this was American or Soviet propaganda. On the one hand it made you hate the Russians, who dropped out of the sky without warning despite NORAD, etc. But on the other, it seemed to be saying that we had nothing to fear from the USSR, because the entire Red Army could be defeated handily by a bunch of teenagers. The icing on the cake was when the kid stood up with a raised rifle and shouted ""Wolverines!"" in full view of an entire Soviet armored column, and yet did not get blasted to smithereens. I guess the Soviets must have left their ammo at home. Ha-ha, big joke! Just like this film.One star (only because IMDb won't let me rate it zero).",Red Dawn

I found it unbelievable that communists would waste their time on a small town, without obviously going for the military installations.  What harm is a small town going to do anyway? However, it was exciting at that, so I gave it an 8.  Pretty wild.  But, I think that if we were under attack, it would be more than a bunch of teenagers.  We would all take up arms and make it impossible for anyone to degrade or defile this country.

160,john-quel,The rarest of Hollywood film types: visionary propaganda,9,22 October 2006,"This is one of those films you are either going to love or hate. I find it difficult to believe anyone would be neutral regarding it. For Hollywood to have even attempted such a thing is astonishing and that it holds up even today (change a few names here and there and the present world emerges) is a testament to the thought and talent of all the people involved in depicting such a future war. The cast is outstanding, the writing is clear and believable (the film is essentially an abbreviated re-telling of what happened in Russia during the German invasion), the theme strong and compelling. Or you can take it as a Cold War artifact, done five years before the entire Eastern Bloc started to unravel. But however you approach the film, it gives you a lot of think about.",Red Dawn
161,nalders,"Fascinating premise, but a lot of flaws. And yes, it is propaganda.",6,31 July 2006,"This movie has sufficient problems that, to save space, I am forced to categorize and list them. Premise Flaws: 1. The dissolution of NATO,communist takeover of Central America, and Revolution in Mexico are all wildly improbable... yet in the spirit of alternate history and 'what if?', acceptable. What I don't accept is the element of 'surprise'; these events would necessitate a high level of alertness and mobilization in the American military, law enforcement, and populace. There would be no 'charter planes' brimming with Spetznaz commandos and Cuban soldiery, nor 'insurgents' infiltrating through the Mexican border. 2. Any use of nuclear weapons by the Soviets would have elicited a nuclear response amounting to total annihilation. Hence a fun Cold War acronym: MAD- Mutually Assured Destruction. Nukes are never tactical, even when they're intended to be, because their effects are strategic. 3. Powers Boothe's character mentions that the Soviets reinforced with '60 divisions; three full armies' or something like that. That's something between several hundred thousand and half a million men, depending on whatever Soviet TO&E was at the time. Moving that many men and all their equipment from Russia to North America would take the world's largest merchant fleet (which Russia never had) several trips under ideal circumstances (with U.S naval capability, ideal would NOT be the word). It could not be done by airlift, under any circumstances, not even granting an improbable Soviet air superiority or the cost of maintaining that superiority. Even if, by some miracle, it happened, it would take the same miracle again to supply those soldiers. Impossible. 4. I do believe that foreign invasion of U.S soil would spark guerrilla action, probably stronger and more professional than portrayed in this movie. I also believe that the first generation of guerrillas would have a very high mortality rate. The learning curve for partisans is steep and unforgiving. The kids in this movie make too many mistakes too quickly, and trust too much. After they made the first leap, from escape and evade to active partisan, they would have been dead in days. Really, half a dozen teenagers just can't attack an armored column with Kalashnikovs and RPGs and expect to survive.Tactical flaws and mistakes: 1. Commandos would have difficulty holding mountain passes, considering that local military and law enforcement would react faster than reinforcement could come. I doubt that they would expend their energy sacking a mountain town, when they should be positioning themselves to take control of certain highways and railways at specific junctions or highly defensible locations. 2. If Soviets did want to take control of a town, instead of simply destroying it, they would not come in guns blazing. They would probably converge on local law enforcement, civil government, key utilities, and key escape routes. They're trying to PRESERVE the town, and its inhabitants, so that both can be of use to them. 3. The action in this film is very Hollywood, with lots of hip-shooting and pyrotechnics. What it really comes down to is this; kids can't fight. Maybe rural kids can shoot, maybe they could hit a deer at 400 yds with Daddy's .30-06, but they're facing professional soldiers steeped in a military doctrine that half the world's armies follow, and hardened by years of guerrilla war, revolution and counterrevolution. The outcome was never in doubt.Red Dawn is still an entertaining 'what if?' movie, full of moderate acting from the promising young stars of two decades ago. John Milius' directing is adequate for the level of movie he was making, and I think it's says something that a basically B-movie like Red Dawn can spark such heated discussion twenty years later in a radically different political climate. Whatever one thinks of his politics, it can't be denied that this movie made a splash.",Red Dawn

They would have used all of their assets, such as the Cubans. The description of what happened as told by Powers Boothe, was very probable. I know what the Soviets were capable of doing. I spent six years of my life teaching other soldiers what they were capable of doing. The movie wasn't perfect. The old French Resistance codes should have been left out.

182,skinnyjoeymerlino,A time capsule from the Cold War era,6,28 January 2007,"Back during the height of President Ronald Reagan's popularity Hollywood produced a slew of all-American-hero-kills-the-Commies flicks, best typified by the wretched Sylvester Stallone vehicle Rambo: First Blood Part II. Red Dawn (the first PG-13 movie) was released in the middle of all of those and maybe that's why it gets vilified in viewer reviews on IMDb.com and gets a one-star rating in the info pop-up when it airs on cable; it's lumped in with mindless action flicks best left consigned to the dumpers out back of bankrupt mom & pop video rental stores. Red Dawn details teenage boys who hide out in the Rocky Mountains after an invasion of America by a Communist army. The boys return to town and stunned by the oppression launch a guerilla war against the occupying troops. The boys take the name Wolverines, after their high school football team. It stars Patrick Swayze and C Thomas Howell, who had appeared together previously in Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders, and their performances here are not their finest work. Some adrenaline-filled action sequences are actually quite watchable.The movie is often lambasted for being unrealistic, but the situation presented is far closer to real life than Sylvester Stallone destroying the entire Vietnamese army with an explosive tipped bow-and-arrow. The Communist soldiers aren't presented as sadistic killers who invade America out of spite. And if nothing else, this movie evokes a time when young men in America fantasized about fighting a guerilla war, rather than our current war where fat losers slap a yellow sticker on their SUV as if that will stop a centuries old civil war in Iraq.",Red Dawn
183,elandyll,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,17 February 2004,"First, let me tell you that in my <humble> opinion, you can make patriotic movies with talent, and avoiding stupid propaganda. This one didn't.The subject is already fascinating, although we have to put it in context (cold war, 1984). North America is invaded by communists (Cubans and Russians), and a group of teenagers (football players in highschool) takes upon them to start the resistance.""V"", the Sci Fi miniseries did so much better on the subject, and without primal anti-communism (though the aliens uniforms were red eh ?)It goes from russians/Cubans landing in a desertic small town, attacking the highschool and shooting everyone in sight (negating both 40 years of technical progress with radar/air support AND rules of War) to a group of teenagers taking out soldiers (but we all know how a trained football player is sooo much better with a riffle than a Commie with an automatic AK-47) and the most stupid propaganda (eg. the scene where the camera goes from a sign that says ""you will only take my gun from my dead fingers"" and pans to a dead body, a russian soldier taking the gun from its hand).I mean, I know the fear of communists was bad up to the 80's, but that is really terrible. The acting is barely ok (thanks to some future stars, Patrick Swaize, Charlie Sheen, C.T Howell, etc. interesting to see their debuts), the dialogue is awfull and most of the directing ridiculous (hard to say if it's intentional or not, the director is after all John Milius -Conan the Barbarian-).This movie has obviously been made to make cash by playing on the fears of the time, the problem being that it is devoid of any intelligence in the plot and of any artistic quality...My rating : 2 out of 10",Red Dawn

But for Hungarians, with many European nations, Soviets were invaders (, after they didn't let the people to make their own decisions).The previous post were full of political arguments. (Even those who rated the movie above average.) I think that most users didn't really categorized this movie well. Partisan movies were made in Yugoslavia, during the cold war, remembering their heroic fight against the Nazis in the WW2. I think somebody watched this in the US and said: ""We don't have this! I want!""The story is well written, but some scenes are calculable. Soviets invade the US? Well this could only happen in the writers mind (intellignece), but the way of invasion was realistic. Soviet-American friendship cafeteria, well organized propaganda........ The characters could be your schoolmate, neighbor, so you can emphasize with them. They have feelings (Finally they are not the absolute perfect guys): they have fears, big moments and boys cry even more than girls.The soviet technology was marching all over the place: Zu-23 anti-air tanks, T-72 or T-80's were in one battle, soviet manufactured APC's.

185,debrecenisrac38,"Well edited, decently to tolerably acted... but the writers should've consulted defectors",6,8 December 2018,"I've seen the remake back when it came out, and saw this one with a complimentary track from Joel McHale and Michael J. Nelson.Something, it turns out I needed badly. The original is, well... a great disservice to American patriotism as it perpetuates the idea, that the adversary is dumb, only got lucky at the first try, and the supposed underdogs have everything at the ready to beat them.There's a reason the invasion at the Bay of Pigs failed, the Soviet spy organization had better sleepers and NOCs then vice versa. A case that to this day remains unchanged, but I digress.Leaving the typical '80s macho action premise aside, here's how actual Soviet invasions succeeded: they have begun their subversive activity well in advance.By the time they had arrived, the mayor, the sheriff, even the emergency services would be collaborators. That's a practice well known to Americans as special interests have long started influencing the elections of judges, prosecutors, sheriffs and mayors.So the idea they just arrive unprepared was funny, but far from real. Remember Cuba, or Afghanistan, they always rally the populace around themselves, implement a coup, weaken democracy and only then take over.Similarly, independent from the jokes, I've found it funny that they just waltzed into town without checkpoints, despite the lady in the shop telling them they're being wanted. There was once a soldier who fled his Russian barracks (he was part of the occupation force), and they sent trucks, jeeps and some tanks to find him, locals like us be damned.Which is why I wasn't surprised even the guys spotted the camp being one where you just walk up, 'cause that's a thing. At least you could say, hey, Mission Impossible IV got Russian prisons right.I get it, people like their freedoms, I do too, only I remember not having them. Imagine such an invasion like being a runaway slave before emancipation, and try to figure who you can trust. The darkest terror doesn't come from what you don't know, rather from those you thought you knew, as they're the ones who know or make up dirt on you so they can keep the cozy lifestyle.",Red Dawn
186,dieBaumfabrik,Relies too much on viewers' goodwill,1,23 January 2006,"Time and distance have not been too kind to this movie, but then I suspect that the budget wasn't either. Too much was spent on the helicopter prosthetics, and not enough on writing, casting and cinematography.'Red Dawn' attempts to tell a common story: what would you do to protect your way of life, and how would those acts of protection change you? It is a movie about resistance to and insurgency against an invader; there is such brutality on both sides that one wonders whether the end justifies the means. It could be construed as an anti-war movie, but I was left with the impression that it was a blatant appeal to the audience: 'The Commies are coming! The Commies are coming!'Like all movies with a political overtone, 'Red Dawn' is very much a zeitgeist, intended to satisfy an ephemeral hunger. Some movies of this ilk are so well-made that they eventually become classics, but this tale of US insurgency against a Soviet invasion cannot be described thus. It is disappointing that a promising idea has been so badly handled; in fact, I wonder whether the project was rushed just to catch the wave of President Reagan's defence policy. It is interesting to note that, had they waited a year, the producers would have been faced with the difficult task of selling a movie in the 'Pink Dawn' of Glasnost.With the concept of zeitgeist (or perhaps 'cash-in') in mind, one may be tempted to forgive all those involved for just going through the numbers and hoping to rely on patriotic support. Many more successful film-makers, however, have realised that it's not enough to preach to the converted. John Milius and Kevin Reynolds should have studied the past and looked at British movies of the 1940s for examples of how to tell a story to people who don't want to listen. It may appear cruel to cite the works of two of the 20th century's best writers, but good writers are needed to tell this kind of story. 'In Which We Serve' (1942, w. Noel Coward) and 'Went the Day Well?' (1942, w. Graham Greene) were two low-budget movies that concentrated on the way of life that their heroes were fighting for. In the case of Coward's work, stranded sailors reflected on this life in a series of flashbacks, whereas with Greene, initially jolly English villagers were faced with a small-scale Nazi paratroop raid. These movies, and many like them, took care to generate empathy in the audience, and reminded them of the need to struggle. Such a simple trick was carelessly overlooked in 'Red Dawn.' In fact, one barely meets the characters before the war reaches them, and they spend little time afterwards considering or debating the changes they undergo. One feels that the writers are incapable of designing introspection. Most attempts to depict the American way of life are clumsy visual or audio clichés: the Flag, 'America the Beautiful' and Guns, lots of Guns. These references are handled in such a way as to make me wonder about the writers' ability to form personal relationships. An opportunity to render the rebel teenagers as 'Everymen' has been wasted; instead, they come across as ciphers.With no rounded characters, no time for thoughtful scenes, and with a set-up dismissed almost before the curtains sweep back, how does Milius fill his hour and three-quarters? With death, destruction and tears. The bulk of the movie consists of an unknown cast of Brat-Packers wandering around the Rockies blasting nearly everything with a red star. Very soon, any supportive thoughts the audience brought with them evaporate as they realise they are watching a movie not about resistance but revenge.Far too much time (and money) is spent on guns, tanks and helicopters. A tedious 'last-stand' scene is stretched out by dull photography focussing on a bunch of Bell choppers poorly dressed up as Soviet gunships. Many scenes of the rebels' deaths are ruined either by such cinematic clumsiness or by dreadful lines delivered by incompetent actors. Each time, I found myself not caring; making a viewer feel that way is the biggest crime in cinema.There is one positive item in the show: the only decent actor in the show is Harry Dean Stanton; since he is the reincarnation of Huckleberry Hound, it's hard not to like him.",Red Dawn

Check me if I'm wrong, but few people believe that would have been a likely scenario for WW3.Hey, it seems this country under Bush 43 is infinitely more brainless than we were 23 years ago(when this movie was released.)

188,T Sirois,Underrated,8,1 December 2001,"Certainly not a 10, but anyone who rated this movie less than a 6 should really question themselves.  I'd be under the impression that a) they simply do not like war movies, or b) they have some sort of agenda.The only complaint I have about the film is it's unrealistic barbaric portayal of the Soviet forces.  Later interviews show that it wasn't Milus' intent, but it was surely was what was conveyed.That being said, the acting was more than adequate. The action was more than adequate.Unrealistically evil portrayal of the Soviet forces aside, the movie attempted to convey a realistic life behind an occupied America through the eyes of high-schoolers that had only known peace and freedom.Can anyone here honestly tell me that a couple of ""kids"" couldn't effectively cause terrorist-style havoc upon installations in their own country?  History has proven these things to be absolutely possible yet voter after voter chimes in with ""unrealistic"".  Put your agenda aside.Finally, how successful were they really?  In the grand scheme of things they damaged an outpost and killed a couple hundred men.  Absolutely not impossible.  AND, hello?  Those who didn't run away were KILLED.  That's right, KILLED.  How's that for realism?I challenge anyone to watch the movie for what it is.  Agreed, the over-done portrayal as the Soviets as ""bad guys"" particularly through the earlier parts of the film are enough for me to drop the movie down a few points. But if you are able to watch it with an open mind, and disconnect that for a moment.  Pay good attention to the visceral imagery, and the realistic portrayal of sleepy-town school kids turned immediate desperate guerilla warriors, and some pretty good acting, and maybe you'll see what I saw in the film.I think the major problem is that those who choose to dump on the movie can't get past the barbarism, which is fair, it's easy for me to keep such an open mind as an American.  And perhaps it's too hard for people to believe in a good performance out of the likes of Swayze, Grey, and Sheen.

Ok, when this movie came out in 1985, it probably wasn't that realistic of a film, but after the events of 9-11-01, this film hits home to alot of people.  Now thinking about it hard, this movie is realistic to now more than it was in 1985(only thing is we are against the Arab's instead of the Soviet's).  It's a great film anyway before this all happened.  People who trashed this aren't obviously American's at all.  And if they say they are, that's a pretty sick joke.This is a good film and it does make you think. 9/10",Red Dawn
190,Mark-457,I am more liberal than you would believe and I love this movie!,7,25 March 2011,"Like a lot of 80's films, you have to view it in the context of the times. The Cold War was an ever present worry, there were two SuperPowers back then in a fierce arms race after the end of WW II. At the end of that war we knew just how brutal the Soviets could be, after defeating Germany and Japan we should have confronted Stalin, but the Allies were spent and so the Cold War simmered instead. History has been re-written to make Reagan a hero for facing them down, but at the time it seemed like he was foolishly provoking them. If you weren't alive then you don't appreciate how high the tensions were. The Soviets were a real mass murdering brutal enemy, armed to the teeth, relentless and expanding. The so called Terrorist Enemy of today is practically cuddly. Reagan crippled them economically by leading luring them to play catch up in arms, but at the time it seemed like things were escalating to a fight.An invasion is fanciful, but the more realistic Atomic Annihilation would have been a much shorter film and wouldn't have had as much man in the street (high school) character drama. This movie puts Us into the situation in a What Would You Do? Collaborate or fight? It's not a great film, but it is a film that I enjoyed. It doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending, like the more recent Battle LA. It does however show some realistic skirmishes, some tough consequences of choosing to fight and just how clumsy and difficult that first taking of a life can be.You just can't judge it with a solely post 2001 political and social mind set.I am somewhat disgusted with the idea that the remake for 2011 has chosen the North Koreans as the bad guys. Hardly a SuperPower. Clearly we don't want to offend the real SuperPower of today, China. Though I can see why China invading would be laughable, they already own us.",Red Dawn

At the beginning we laughed well enough but as the movie wore on we grew tired and the last hour and thirty minutes was sheer hell. it was just boring and bad and stupid...based on this movie the gross incompetence of the Soviet forces leads me to believe that there was no training for Soviet soldiers.

192,Mellow_Biafra,My goodness you kids with this political stuff,6,25 January 2003,"Perhaps I am too laid back but I see this film as just a interesting action ""B"" movie playing on American fears of the 1980s and cold war era. I remember when I first saw this movie when I was a teenager after hearing about it from friends and talking about how cool it would be to have freedom like the kids in the movie did while fighting a common enemy. However, upon re-watching it on TV, I still see it as a fairly decent action movie that's interesting enough to watch. I consider myself strongly left wing and liberal and I do see propaganda and some interesting paranoia themes but every movie has a view point and this one just takes a sort of conservative view if that's how you see it. This movie is kind of lame in that the dialogue is corny and some of the writing, directing and editing is questionable but outside of that it's not bad. At some points some of the incoherent politics do get on my nerves, however I just picture the kids fighting aliens, lol. Anyone who tries to make anything political out of this movie is looking for a fight and a vehicle to express their opinion, I think anyway. So like I said, this film is a just a decent ""B"" movie to kill a afternoon with by watching some of the nifty action scenes and making fun of Patrick Swayze, now at a time when this type of fear is past us as Americans (there is no terror threat and even if there was it has nothing to do with this movie, that would be like saying Back to Bataan is relevant and teaches us to be ever vigilant), we should just watch these kind of movies and go with it, like watching World War Two John Wayne Films. Now go watch this film pilgrim, and in closing I think I've managed to offend and disagree with both sides of the argument of this film, so good for me and the left and right political peoples that lurk these boards looking for stuff to complain about need to relax, it's just film and film is different to each through their interpretation and opinion.",Red Dawn
193,Movie_Reviewer123,"Good Attempt, Ridiculous Presentation",3,2 June 2010,"Though I'm not American myself, I am used to the propaganda and flag-waving idiocy in the American media, having reviewed such horrible titles as ""The Patriot"". This was a bit different, but in the end, it's the same thing.The plot is rather hectic and sudden, but that's war I suppose. The film opens with normal classes going on at a high school in the Midwest America, and suddenly waves of troops, later shown to be Spetsnaz, flood over the quaint town and completely take it over, putting in into occupation. That's right, the number one fear of every American in the Cold War: complete Soviet takeover. Well, not exactly complete.A group of teens manage to escape into the woods and mountains surrounding their town, and become dead-set on taking their town back. This is where a plausible, guerrilla situation takes a turn for the stupidly worse. The rest of the film is of little importance. It basically shows the students, now in a group known as ""The Wolverines"", fighting and beating the you-know-what out of every pesky Russkie that comes there way. Eventually, the entire group is killed, but it is hinted the invasion was beaten back.In the Cold War, America's view of it was simply hopeless. Everyone expected either to be nuked into dust or swarmed over and taken control of by the Soviets, but this movie provided a different, albeit implausible, outlook. The film gave hope, showing that if the Soviets attacked, the Yanks could still win (why they needed morale-boosting propaganda in the late 1980s, when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse anyway, I haven't a clue).Here are the worst complaints I have though: 1. A group of teens couldn't defeat Soviet forces. Obviously the directors were hard-core patriots, but they need to come-to with reality: 4, 5, or 6 teens aren't nor could stand up to even a handful of Soviets, unless of course the Soviets just gave up and killed themselves.2. There is no real plot. It's just repeated scenes of attack and attack by the Wolverines.3. The Soviets are portrayed as their typical, bumbling selves.Though as a propaganda piece, I suppose it served its purpose, but as a movie, it failed fairly poorly.

There are so many actors in the beginning of their careers and the make their roles just perfect.

You can't just throw a statement like that around when there's garbage like Day of the Dead 2: Contagium out there.

Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson & Powers Boothe provide memorable presences....if not performances.Although director John Milius appears to have rested on his dubious laurels through much of the production, I still feel that this film, over time, has achieved iconic placement in the grand scheme of things.

Red Dawn itself is a fair movie about people's reaction to an actual invasion of the US. The Russians and Cubans come off as the perfect evil protagonists and the kids fighting them, well come on-they're the good guys. Too bad the producers didn't change the invasion's locale to Beverly Hills or Hollywood so the patriot's could also kick the ass of the producers of Testament and The Day After and the rest of the moribund left, many of whom at that time had nothing but warm and fuzzy feelings for their ideological co-stars in Havana, Moscow and Managua.",Red Dawn
199,ali-mostaque,Propaganda movie to help Ameican rearmament from the eighties.,4,12 October 2008,"I watched this movie before, several years back and promptly forgot about it.America had lost the Vietnam war (1975), and movies like this were designed to justify rearmament, renewed national chauvinism and pride in the American nation. There were a whole string of movies along this aggressive genre......Rambo's etc.....This was along with the political backdrop of the Reagan era, and a more aggressive foreign policy. The Soviet Union collapsed, mainly because of the unworkability of Communism and the huge problems the country faced trying to make a system work the impossible.The movie has a 1950's UFO Martians(Russians)are coming tackiness about it, and is wholly unbelievable.There would be a nuclear exchange before it were allowed to get to this juncture, and America in the 1980's could mobilize 8 million men and women, so no power could just parachute into the USA..........for god sake! No connection with reality.However there is a bit of irony. The irony is that America in many ways has become a totalitarian society, where regular troops parade through the country during emergencies, and now more regularly in some parts. Concentration camps have been built by the American government to hold millions of dissenting Americans. The level of surveillance, and so forth created after false flag ops by the Israelis and their American puppets.America now goes forth abroad to ""liberate"" people in foreign countries, using lies deception, torture, rape, resource theft, and so forth.So why use teenagers to resist in the movie? I assume it is a RECRUITMENT ad for future generations of military personnel into the late eighties and 1990's........in this, the absurd scenario and cardboard actors in the ""MOVIE"" play a an excellent role for the Pentagon.The Soviet Union was a brutal empire, and one only has to remember their performance in Afghanistan where 1.5 million Afghans perished under them to remember this (1980-1989). The demise of the USSR was good for America, the world and for the people of the Soviet Union. But in the process of fighting evil one has to avoid becoming evil, and this movie provides no thought on this matter, or any reflection..........The cardboard acting, and silly premise provides no depth, just conflict and basic flag waving. There is also a bit of good old fashioned racism thrown in with the swarthy Cubans being ever present, doing some of the nastiest bit of pantomime evil for the little ignorant kiddies.Yes they are flooding in from the South, and will take over the country in a few years.The dialogue...basic, basic.The action/military encounter sequences were also unrealistic......in real guerrilla warfare it doesn't happen like this..........See the beautifully made ""Come and See"" movie 1986 Soviet Union.However the movies premise is not totally irrelevant in the present American context, where the country is being led by its ruling elite.

The Cubans and Nicaraguans have developed the manpower to penetrate our borders following Soviet nuclear strikes on America's own warhead silos. Every resource of the US military is engaged in a fierce struggle with hundreds of enemy divisions. Coastal metro areas (The ""blue"" states for those who must think of this in political terms) are adequately defended, but the vast heartland has become a living hell under Soviet control: the aforementioned nuclear destruction of our own MAD defense apparatus has killed millions, with Stalinist/Maoist style slaughter of civilians as well as famine increasing the death toll even further. Our European ""allies,"" meanwhile, haven't lifted a finger. And they say this movie is fiction!People ill informed enough to compare the Wolverines to Viet Cong or Ansar al Islam in Iraq probably failed to notice that the Wolverines had lived under a free democratic government before being taken over by communists whose disregard for human life has become little more than a cliché in the minds of many. Nor did the Wolverines use violent conscription and taxation methods to further their cause. No toddler's arm was chopped off, no village leader was mutilated for all to see. No one was blown up for being a collaborator, in any context.All through the film, we do see American helicopters, tanks, and planes striking against the Cuban army. But they are spread too thinly to successfully cover all of what has become enemy territory. The Wolverines are but one lone band who have limited abilities and limited goals. They fight for their town, their own piece of ground in the Western plains. Other similar groups exist across the region. Nor is it a leap of the imagination to suggest that football players versed in teamwork, communication, and strategic thought could apply their skills on a battlefield. Teenage boys raised in a rugged forest, taught to hunt, fish, and tolerate the elements might well adapt to guerilla warfare, even with minimal combat instruction. Still, the convenient appearance from nowhere of Powers Boothe to tell them what the hell is going on and convey the 5 minute green beret course adds legitimacy to the view that Red Dawn is as silly as V or any other martians attack flick with commies substituted for space blobs.Red Dawn is worth watching in my view. But it's not for everyone. The latte drinkers, Will and Grace fans, Volvo drivers, Peace Corps volunteers, and New York Times crowd don't seem to care much for this film, and that's their privilege.",Red Dawn

I had just started hunting with my father (A Vietnam-vet Army LRRP), here in Minnesota, and seeing this made me and all of my friends wonder what we would do if this were to happen. That says it all I think. In 1984, it was not terribly far-fetched to a 14 year-old that this could happen, because we really were that concerned about the Soviet Union back then. Nobody could have convinced me that the Soviets wouldn't exist by the time I started college. For that matter, nobody in the world could have been convinced of that. The collapse of the Soviet Union caught the entire world by surprise, and that is the one fact that people overlook when watching this film now.

This is what things would have looked like, if we had invaded you in 1984. (I am from Serbia, South-Eastern Europe, and we were a communist land then. I recognize the procedures, the mentality, of the invaders, I can largely follow what they say.) This film should have received several Oscars, but no, it was shunned by Americans because it was not the usual Hollywood sugary water.The Red Dawn is blood-and-truth film, but very far from the usual wish-fulfillment, formulaic production so practiced in Hollywood. It was not shown in Serbia, then, because it was politically undesirable: anticommunist. Then, years passed, communism fell, but now the movie was too old. But now in Serbia it receives some very positive reviews in the SF fandom. I should almost say: a small cult following.The film is in science-fiction genre (because of the Third World War, and nuclear weapons used in it), although it has no visible science-fictional elements -- they are only verbally mentioned. But so it is in Lord of the Flies, too.Two girls in the unit are true partisan girls.

208,SciFiSly,"""Go die, Yankee! Die!""",4,18 July 2005,"I should first explain that this movie came out when I was in the 10th grade and John Hughes was the only director who seemed to understand what it was like to be a teenager in the '80's. We were also a bit paranoid about what the Russians might do, ticked that they were still in Afghanistan and then had the gall to boycott the Olympics in L.A. The Russians were the bad guys and in those days bad guys were a lot easier to identify.So, combine all of these elements and what you get is RED DAWN. Russians were the bad guys, parents were helpless and the kids were the only ones who could save the U.S. -- or at least a small corner of it.Did the movie work back then? No, and for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with the films premise. Other than the initial assault on the town at the beginning of the movie it takes over 40 minutes to get any sense of how bad things are around the rest of the country or how the Russian's managed to gain control of the mid-west with a handful of tanks, some Spanish speaking communists and a couple of helicopters.This film is little more than an adolescent fantasy that collapses under the weight of a weak script and by-the-numbers direction. RED DAWN could have been much more but instead serves as little more than a companion piece to the ABC mini-series ""Amerika,"" another hopelessly dated relic of the 80's.",Red Dawn

Though the film is dated and has sub-par acting, the movie plays off the story more than anything else. The story us unique and does not make America out to be the bad ass super country. On top of that it plays both side and makes both, to a certain level out to be human. One of the most interesting parts of the movie is its dialogue on insurgency which is very important today considering Iraq. I think his movie is important for viewers today to watch so as to understand current events though it is not of the same quality it is interesting as the Battle of Algiers in its perspective on insurgency and terrorism. I ask viewers to look at the movie from this sort of perspective when they watch instead of judging it before hand and ignore Swayze and Sheen.",Red Dawn

Do you need to forgive the fact it's as old as it is? Yes. Do you need to suspend a little belief? Well, it's a fictional war movie so yeah you do. Is it difficult to watch Charlie Sheen crying and not think he's going to pop up and say ""winning!"" ... yes.With all that it's actually a pretty decent anti war film that makes a very solid point. In the modern age invasions lead to nothing but civilian death, occupiers being killed by guerrilla tactics and ultimately that war was horrible choice in the first place. Literally no one wins, no one.That some people are so obsessed with somehow defending socialism or even communism when economic systems weren't even mentioned is just ridiculous. The movie was about defending a homeland against a foreign invader, everyone should appreciate that even the Commies that hate this movie.",Red Dawn
214,joelweymouthtais,A Pro-American Movie when Hollywood loved Communism,10,26 September 2009,"This movies is very good on several levels.It shows that even the highest ideals get corrupted with the insanity of war and killing. Killing other human beings do not leave you better but with a wound that can never be healed. I remember another Milius production (Rough Riders) and during the training of Arizona Militia, they used an Apache. The first question they asked ""Have you ever killed a man"", if the answer was yes, the Apache would look into the respondents eyes and verify if it were true. The point is you see the visible change in Robert, from an innocent teenager, to a stone killer. You also see this in all the characters, except Danny who was simply there by chance but did fight and later survived.Red Dawn showed that weakness invites attack from enemies.Red Dawn showed the Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Russians as enemy of freedom. This was not a popular concept in 1984 among the Hollywood elite, but they have always loved Communism for some reason, even though if I had a gun with 4 bullets and Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Marx, and Mao stood before me: I would not shoot Hitler. This is because the other 4 are more evil. Nazis are not right wing: they became right wing because the MSM called them right wing after they attacked the Soviet Union. I personally would have destroyed Communism before Nazism.Red Dawn showed what would happen if Communism took over the United States: book burning, concentration camps, political executions, and barbarism. Taken in context of 1984, the Soviet Union was the enemy and they were expanding with great abandon. Soviets in 1984 were in Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Namibia, Eastern Europe, Afghanistan, Cuba, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, Yemen, El Salvador (advisers to the insurgency). Or to put it plainly, most of the world lived under Communism and Red Dawn merely showed the same thing happening in the US that happened in other countries occupied by Communism! Soviet tactics were ruthless and they were never concerned about the ""well being"" of civilians.There was very good attention to detail in Red Dawn showing the ""Wolverines"" as young people from an rural background. City kids just don't have much fight in them usually. For those who scoff at teen-aged American kids organizing and fighting a competent insurgency against trained, professional Russian soldiers: let me remind you that the Viet Cong were uneducated farmers that raised a lot of havoc with trained and superior equipped American Soldiers. Also, the average age of the continental soldier in Washington's army was 16. Another point that Red Dawn shows, Russian Troops were never that good a fact proved in Afghanistan and Chechniya.All in all, the movie is entertaining, patriotic, and as realistic as Hollywood can get about any subject. But more it does show deeper truths. Some would make patriotism as a negative, think about what level of brainwashing would create that attitude. I would suggest if you are a film student in college doing research, get some Conservative commentaries about the USSR as well as Liberal, then watch this movie. It is a good period piece.",Red Dawn

They get this whole airborne invasion into place without the United States noticing that anything is happening? And while all this is going on, where exactly are the American armed forces? Just sitting back and letting the Cubans and the Russians take over the country? Maybe sending in a half-hearted (sorry, tenth-hearted) response in the form of one Bell helicopter with half a dozen rockets against said half battalion? On their own soil???!!!

However this movie was not planned to win Oscars, but present a rousing cold war film showing that no matter who you are, you can still help your country from evil Russian stereotypes.Heading the motley crew is a young Patrick Swayze as Jed Eckert, he is joined by 7 other teenagers including an early appearance by Charlie Sheen as Matt Eckert as they get into a variety of situations with the enemy, from ambushing them to raiding a camp where the teenagers dads are being held hostage, however the final assault on the Russian held town does seem a little rushed with few extras.

C Thomas Howell plays a white boy advisedly as he is white (this is before Soul Man). The boy who was Danny Glick in Salem's Lot plays a whining boy called Danny although this time he isn't a vampire. Ben Johnson makes badly written dialogue sound fine. Harley Christiensen was typecast AGAIN as 'man on pole'. Lois Kimbrell as Mrs Mason presented some soup with a subtle poignancy and it was good to see the Meisner brothers reunited as Russian Tanker 1 and 2.

There is only one single reason that people are giving it one star, their political leanings. I've heard it all before, the USA is the main problem with the world, other despotic rulers are just misunderstood.Ho Chi Minh, Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro were (are) hero's to their people and America has no right to intervene. Uncle Joe Stalin really didn't kill 20 million Ukrainians, Mao Zedong really didn't kill 100 million Chinese, and the Khmer Rough really didn't kill 2 million Cambodians. Oh, excuse me Kampucheans. The communists in Rhodesia were kind to the common people as well.However, America exports revolution to the world to support it's vast Defense Contrators' bottom lines. GWB started the Afghan and Iraq war for the enrichment of Halliburton executives at the expense of innocent Iraqis. The USA systematically targets civilians, and has since Vietnam.Hitler (the only despot these people claim to despise) was second in his evil only to ""King George II."" These same people are OK with killing 35+ million Americans since Roe V. Wade in 1973, but are (supposedly) against killing 7 million Jews from 1933 - 1945. I say supposedly because the left is fanatically anti-Semitic. Israel is at least as evil as America.Back to the movie. If a foreign force invaded America, I would kill them until I was killed. Just like in Red Dawn. If you notice, everyone died or was dying at the end. Most people who have recently posted on this movie would have acted like the slim-ball mayor and turned in their own sons. Pathetic how people hate the thing that allows them to hate. They have NO APPRECIATION how good it is here in America. Ever wondered why Cuban in Florida are solidly Republican?

A time, months after North America (OK, I'm Canadian) had watched a miniseries of nuclear holocaust, ""The Day After"".If you can escape into this contemporary paranoid context, I think you can have fun watching this movie.It's a film that captures the paranoia of the times, like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" or ""On The Beach"" during the Cuban Missile Crisis, even though it doesn't stand strongly in comparison to those works of art.",Red Dawn

First of all, the Russians team up with the Mexicans against the U.S., and that is how they come into America...through Mexico. Also, this movie does not treat women like dirt, because I was leaning in that direction myself at the start, but I was pleased at how the women were given a makeover to be equal to their male colleagues.  Plus, this movie isn't for war-lovers, and anyone to think that has a very naive view of the plot. This movie is for patriots and for people who believe in the human right to defend themselves and their homeland.  It is not displaying that the characters loved war...they thought nothing good of it, but they weren't afraid of the Russians when it came to the core of it.  These teenagers were able to use their intelligent strategies, training, and just the simple faith of reacquiring their lives from those who stole them to push the enemy out giving others hope in the process.  ""Red Dawn"" is not sexist, war-loving, or whatever other ridiculous name you can label it.

Those of us that lived near air bases just assumed that if and when it hit the fan, we, and everyone in our towns, our family, our friends, would be gone.Generations post Cold War Era can only try to imagine what it was like. Try to let what I've just described sink-in for a few moments.Red Dawn isn't so much a flick about what could have happened so much as it's a flick about what we were afraid might. We can all look back now and laugh at it, critique it, disregard it.It serves as an astute reminder of a time we've since put behind us.Or have we ?Sometimes I wonder if the roles have been reversed; now our armies occupy distant lands; now our children are the occupiers.Red Dawn is many things, maybe that's why there are so many detracting views of it.

Looking at this film post 9/11 and with an eye on what's happening to us here in Europe every day as the thought police hammer us into thinking our native cultures are worth nothing and multiculturalism ( aka colonisation) is good for us, Red Dawn is more relevant than ever. The film has it's flaws. One minute Jennifer Gray is a scared teenager, the next she's emptying a GPMG from a sexy diagonal lying position. The ease with which six or seven woverines take out the bad guys doesn't wash. There's also some awful dialogue ('it keeps me warm'). On the other hand Swayze delivers a blistering performance as Jed and the cinematography is great. A film I can watch several times. The basic thrust of this film is don't take your comforts and freedom for granted. The Americans sure as hell don't.

Back to this movie. Red Dawn, (the 1984 original), is about a Soviet-led invasion of the United States. Eight high school students from Calumet, Colorado, become insurgents calling themselves ""Wolverines."" (The nickname of their high school's sports teams). Arming themselves with hunting rifles, and bows and arrows, they begin a guerrilla war against the Soviets, Cubans, and Nicaraguans. Some said that it was a teen fantasy. Others said that it was a madman's delusional fantasy. Screw that. I say that's the best future history movie ever made. Granted, this is a late Cold War movie, but consider it a cautionary tale----we take our freedom for granted----- and we lose it. Like the ABC miniseries Amerika, which aired three years later, Red Dawn is about the occupation of the United States. This is the beginning of World War III. Amerika was set right after the end of World War III. Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Powers Booth were in the original.

I've given enough decent scores to movies with painfully obvious left-wing rants to know a movie can be good, even if you disagree with the political message.This movie explores what would happen in a Communist invasion of the US. Unlike brainless movies like Rambo or Invasion USA, this movie gives depth to characters on both sides and explores interesting questions.  It remains believable with regard to the fighting.  Although the kids who form a resistance are pretty amazingly good at it, it doesn't turn into something where the hero just gets knocked over by a bomb and the enemy can't shoot straight.A number of the main characters were portrayed by actors who went on to have quite distinguished careers.  The acting is good, even if the writing seems a little contrived at times.Probably the biggest negative is that it is now dated.

I suppose that it does have a lot of explosions and gunfire and dying, but I have always thought of action movies as ones where the ""action"" is.. glorified, if not glorious. When an explosion happens, there should be someone flying through the air in a tuxedo, when buildings fall down someone should be yelling ""SHIIIIIT!"" and when people die it should be after they've choked out their dying threat or quip. This movie's explosions and gunfire just make people fall down and die, and it's always expressed how much they don't want to, and often what it does to the psyche of the person who did the exploding or gunfiring.I'm not American and I wasn't alive in 1984, so there might well be a lot of contextual meaning that I missed. I don't particularly like war movies as a genre, because I can imagine well enough for myself that it's horrible. Setting the movie in a fictional war made me keep watching because I didn't know what the outcome would be. There was also enough personal story to keep me watching to find out how the characters, as well as the war, would go.""They fought here alone; and gave up their lives, so that this nation shall not perish from the earth.I did wonder, several times, is it really worth all that? The kids just kept killing people, and more people got killed because of that, and by the end most of the Wolverines were dead too. To keep America America. Now I missed the start so I don't know if the invading forces were planning to do terrible things with the country. But I could not see that the idea of ""america"" was worth all of the violent deaths that I saw in this movie. I also didn't want to write off the story that the Wolverines had lived through. So I thought again, and now I wonder if maybe the idea of many differently-ideal-ed nations are necessary, and that it is worth death-fighting to keep a variety of governments in the world.I suppose fighting for ideals rather than lives is one of those great heroic issues. I find it a bit interesting that a movie whose characters really don't seem to know (or address) what purpose on earth they're fighting for seems to end up having that message of nationality.Actually, scratch that. They DO address that question. Patrick Swayze's character shouts (at the execution of the Russian and the turncoat) ""THEY DON'T LIVE HERE"", or something similar. The instinct of ""you're on me, get off"" is the strongest motivation for partisan fighting on offer in this movie. That it's expressed in so few words and with such simplicity, and that there's no treatise on American ideals spoken or read, makes the ending rather hollow to me now. It leaves ""this nation"" as not a people unified under whatever bill or constitution or dream it is that's supposed to make America American, but as a load of people who just happen to be there, who've been there for some time, and don't want no- one on their land, y'hear? And that is unfortunate, seeing as how modern America has the history that it does. It maybe also makes the story as a whole more understandable and relatable.I did find Red Dawn rather watchable. And setting a non-fantastic genre movie in a fictional war is very endearing, to me.",Red Dawn
236,MonolithicJudge,I Hate Las Vegas!,10,20 February 2006,"I hate Las Vegas because I have been hypnotized; there is absolutely no other logical explanation on why I love this movie, except one day as I lay in slumber a sneaky man with a swirly coin crept into my room and whispered these sweet words in my ear, ""When I snap my fingers you will love Red Dawn for all eternity, no matter how much you analyze or ridicule it, you will forever be bound to this motion picture."" When the fingers snapped and my eyes flipped open on this fateful day I was, much like he foretold, forever bound to this film. Now I can't even begin to describe the laugh out loud problems with this film; alright I can give it a shot. Let's say I believe this alternate reality where Russia and communism prevails during the Cold War, fine no problem there. Moving on let's say I understand that these communist forces are interested in invading the United States for natural resources; still o.k. But after taking these things into account I still cannot for the life of me figure out why they would parachute an armored division into a small town in Colorado. What possible tactical advantage could you have being in an isolated state that is surrounded on all sides? The movie only gets better from there as the carnage begins; Mr. Tisdale (Also known as Eclipse from Lockup fame) is brutally massacred by a hail of gunfire after he tries to reason with these apparently off course skydivers. Uh, Mr. Tisdale these men have a whole bunch of guns maybe we should run out the back? Then again maybe not. After poor Tisdale goes down our hero, Patrick Swayze comes and saves the day by grabbing a handful of students and piling them into his pickup, they proceed to get the necessary provisions, (A football and some rice crispy treats) and head for the mountains only to have a hole shot into their radiator. Good thing old Jed (Swayze) knows how to fix those things MacGyver style (Probably with egg whites) and fortunately for them Danny has to go to the bathroom at that time. It's hard to document the film from here except for the funny things that happen within it; one, the boys sneak into town, (apparently something happened to the truck that we never find out about), and speak to a lady about toothbrushes; this lady, who happens to be a friend says the Cuban/Soviet troops are looking for them, which is funny because at this exact moment what appears to be a high ranking officer is staring directly at their faces and doesn't make a peep. Hilarity continues to ensue when the cast of misfits, labeled the Wolverines, begins to grow. For some reason Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey join the squad only to make a few retarded comments, and then one Powers Boothe comes aboard as an Airforce Colonel who tries to inform us how the war efforts are going. My personal favorite part is when he is reciting what allies the U.S has, and informs how there are 600,000,000 screaming China men on our side. Darrell proceeds to state, ""I thought there was a billion screaming China men?"" Which the colonel replies, ""There was."" So let me get this straight, in this war China alone has lost over 400,000,000 people; which is roughly 80 times more loss of life than WWII. Since I apparently love this film I don't want to ruin too much more of it for you, except pay attention to when Jed is crying alone on a mossy rock, when he sniffs a big snot bubble comes out his nose which he quickly sucks back in; how did they miss this in editing. Also when the Soviet helicopter captain is talking about how to catch this band of Wolverines he has a picture of the actual animal on a white board; what would this accomplish, knowing what kind of furry critter they have named themselves after. Maybe it's just me and I am missing something important there. But the Judge does personally want you to enjoy this film, but hopefully you haven't been hypnotized like I have. If only I could go back in time and found out who did this to me, wait a second, where was Patrick Swayze on that particular night? He has some questions to answer.",Red Dawn

Simple as that.,7,11 May 2019,"It's no masterpiece, but reading some of the reviews here...you'd think it was an affront to humanity and that some people has been personally harmed by its existence.It's an action movie, folks. Don't get your communist panties in a twist. Just kick back, enjoy it and get off your soapbox.",Red Dawn
240,doveshooter,It obviously touched a nerve,7,29 September 2005,"Reading previous commentary, I'm amused by the violent reaction this movie still elicits. The ranting of previous reviewers indicates the movie touched a nerve. I have seen really, really bad movies and Red Dawn is certainly not as bad as the ratings it has received here.As is so often the case, many previous reviewers are criticizing the film because its premise conflicts with their political philosophy. I wonder how they would have rated this film had the characters been teen-aged members of an all-black football team who become partisans fighting bigoted southern whites in a 1960s civil war that never occurred. Would they be so harsh if the movie were about a group of teenage Jewish soccer team members fighting the Nazis in World War II? they might not have rated it nine or 10 stars but I'd bet they would have given it more than one star. Given the current political climate, they might even receive it more warmly if the characters were Iraqi teenagers fighting Americans.I understand the temptation to judge movies based on your own preferences rather than the movie's own merits. I recently watched Easy Rider for the first time and absolutely could have kicked myself for wasting the two hours or so it took the silly drivel to play out. Were I to rate it strictly on the way I felt about the movie -- the silly situations at the commune where 50 hippies are supposed to live all winter on about a half acre of wheat, about enough to produce a loaf of bread, the laborious acid dropping scene, the cartoonishly villainous red necks, the lame acting (other than Nicholson) -- I guess I'd have to give it about a one-star rating. But it was a beautifully filmed movie and it obviously spoke to people at that time. So a more valid assessment from my perspective would be that it's an anachronism that seems a bit silly today but obviously had merit in context.I believe Red Dawn touched something in young people of the mid-80s in the same way Easy Rider touched young people in the late 60s. Sift through the silliness of both movies and you find something people were looking for. Prior to this movie, young people were told that if World War III came, they would either be swallowed by an irresistible communist onslaught or fried in a matter of seconds by a nuclear explosion. Red Dawn said to them, ""If the time comes, you will not be helpless. You will fight back and win."" It was an entirely unique message at the time and one people were longing to hear. In fact, The United States was already fighting back and won it's greatest victory over its most formidable foe without direct armed conflict and bloodshed because of visionary and resolute political leadership.From the time of its release until today, Red Dawn has been roundly criticized for the implausibility of the plot. It's quite true that the communist bloc was not capable of a successful invasion of the United States in 1984. But for those who failed to grasp this, Red Dawn was not a documentary. The prologue establishes the circumstances under which the invasion occurred and the action that proceeds from that premise is possible. Would communist troops shoot up a school? Their battle record indicates that if they saw it as or mistook it for a tactical objective, they most certainly would. Would they shoot civilians? Is there anybody out there so ignorant to suggest they wouldn't?Good Points about Red Dawn: *The action sequences are well done and look realistic. For instance, there's a scene where a plane drops a bomb. You see the fireball first and then hear the sounds. That's a nice, realistic touch. *The actors handle their weapons properly *Beautiful photography *There's some good chemistry between some of the actors *The outcome is typical of what happens in partisan fighting. Partisans typically enjoy initial success because of surprise and knowledge of the terrain. But they usually eventually succumb to better-trained, better-equipped troops *I liked the musical scoreBad points about Red Dawn: *The communists are a tad too stupid for too long *The use of horses is a stretch. *Some of the teenage high-fiving and exuberance will make you groan *Some (but not all) of the dialog and acting is awfully stiffIn short, it's an action picture that will entertain people who like action pictures. It has a unique plot line that has now become an anachronism. At it takes a jab at one of Hollywood's scared cows, communism which is refreshing. Nobody should be ashamed of making it, acting in it or enjoying watching it.Politically, the real question is not why Hollywood made a film like Red Dawn. It is rather, why did 50 years of totalitarian communist oppression spawn so few films critical of communism? Why are there seemingly scores of movies about McCarthyism and none about the Soviet gulag system? Schindler's List shows that Hollywood can make an incredible film, a film so compelling you can't take your eyes off of it, about something so horrible you can hardly bear to think about it. Stalin's body count exceeds Hitler's yet there is no Schindler's List for the Gulag. And that is something to be ashamed of.",Red Dawn
241,nemo-1,Totally underappreciated,8,1 March 2001,"1984's Red Dawn is as creepy, and haunting of a social commentary as has ever been made.  It should also be considered as the quintessential film for any would-be partisans.  It shows the fractures of our society clearly, and what would be the likely result should our country ever be forced into a full scale war again.  History not withstanding the characters of the Mayor, a self serving turncoat; Col. Bella, a tried soldier who just wants to return home from what has become a useless fight; and Jed the young, charismatic rebel leader who all to soon feels the true weight of command, are all especially telling.

Upon my 1st viewing of Red Dawn, years ago, it was very gripping/interesting. I feel it was/is very entertaining. I like action and Scifi movies. I knew then (and now) it would be unlikely/impossible for a Russian invasion like this to occur, but it's not ridiculously impossible. As a child, I went through the Civil Defense drills at school (get under desk/table, put head between knees). We knew then it was because of the Russian Nuclear threat. My school had a basement Civil Defense Shelter, I still remember the signs. So for me, how can this Russian invasion be so impossible?

The entire premise was ludicrous: anyone who actually knew anything about the conditions in the USSR at the time this film was made knew how completely impossible it would have been for the Soviets to invade the US. Anyone who knows anything at all about military strategy understands the absurdity of a land invasion crossing all Siberia and then coming down the Rockies. The proof of this is in the disastrous Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. If the Soviet Army couldn't control four million ill-armed Afghans, how on Earth could they be expected to deal with the might of the US? The real irony is that a great deal of what we see American teens doing really WAS done -- by young SOVIETS under Nazi occupation. The US has no experience with foreign invasions; the Russians (Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, etc.) most certainly do.",Red Dawn
245,barrieca,Entertaining but suffers from a lack of plausibility at times,6,29 January 2007,"Red Dawn has all the elements of a good solid patriotic film, from either side of the fight. The major flaws are all at the military political level of plot development and the fact that these are never really explained to any great satisfaction does sort of strain the premise a bit. Over all I like the movie, a throughly enjoyable testosterone filled film that does make you proud to be American and realise the freedom is something that can never to taken away from unless your willing to give it up. So what follows is just my picayune points that were made during the movie.1. 500,000 Cuban and Nicaraugan troops invade. 63 Russian divisions roughly 600,000 men and tanks. The Russians come across the Bering Strait, cut the pipeline and drive south to Cheyene while the Cuban and Nicaraugan troops come in as paratroops disguised as commercial airline flights. Really what road where 600,000 men/tanks coming down from Alaska except the one two lane and in places gravel road that's there. They would have been annihilated before that got 50 miles into the US. Movie makes no mention of spy satellite data which would have picked up all this troop movement and build up.2. Russian nukes 400 million Chinese and they do nothing? The Chinese would have screamed across the border with everything they had not to mention massive nuclear missile retaliation wiping out the USSR. Ditto the US Navy via submarines, which gets no mention in the film, would have nuked Cuba and Nicarauga not to mention Mexico, cutting the supply line to enemy troops, then the Army would have driven across the southern US to the sea and cut them off.3. Roughly 1.1 million troops are going to hold 250 million Americans hostage, do the math, it would never work.4. Jeb is told during the winter that maybe in the spring the US is going to drop special forces in to help him. What they need to wait for good weather, some special forces? 5. Way too little use of the radio they are given and Radio Free America. This would have been there lifeblood and sustaining courage.I'm sure there are other points as well. This could have been a fantastic film and maybe even a mini series but it need to have a military adviser and a stronger scenario for it to score higher in my book.",Red Dawn

247,r8erz,Wow. Some reviewers are too serious.,9,26 January 2006,"First. I am a Liberal. I oppose war in general, especially pre-emptive ones. But to make this movie out as propaganda is ridiculous!The movie is set and was filmed in a small town in New Mexico USA. Las Vegas, NM to be exact, (northern NM). I grew up near there - in the mountains. The movie is a pretty good depiction of what it is like there (well - except for the communist invasion and all that). Most people there, myself included, would own guns. Many many trucks would have a bumper sticker like ""they can have my guns when they pry them from my cold dead hands"". Lots of kids would be trained to hunt and use weapons, from a young age. I was. Lots of people there, including myself, are or were members of the NRA.Why is that all made-up or Propaganda? It is how life is in small town and rural New Mexico, especially in the Rocky Mountains.... It isn't San Francisco or Manhattan...Also, one person complained about the number of black characters. Have you ever been to Northern New Mexico? In my entire K through 12 school experience we had 2 black people. Thats it. Our high school had about 900 people in it, and K-12 probably around 3000 total... 2 black kids in the whole 12 years I was there. If anything, the movie did not have enough Spanish people (Americans, they did have the Cubans). This movie is great. It has everything you need from an action movie. It has Heroes you can get behind - but that still have realistic problems and struggles. It has bad guys who are evil - but that you can also see their side.It has fun battle scenes, and the characters share good chemistry and dialog - for an action movie. It is also fun to see Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey shooting RPGs instead of dancing.It is a fun ""what if"" and nothing more. People are reading way too much into this movie to make it into some political weapon.I enjoyed this movie then, and I own it now, and I am a Liberal living in one of the most Liberal cities in the USA (on the Left Coast ! ).

While Soviet troops did outnumber American ground forces in peace times by 4 to 1, an invasion is extremely unlikely considering America's higher population and more advanced air force and navy. The film shows a handful of teenagers armed with not much battling soviet tanks and helicopters and winning. It really seems cheesy when a few kids that have never received military training attack and completely overrun a Soviet base with a far higher garrison along with American prisoners. If the Russians couldn't fight at all how could they have conquered the country in the first place? it really made me laugh when the Russian general was awed at the bravery of those kids and didn't shoot them. this is an ""ok"" film if you have a few friends over or don't have anything better to do and not have cable and wanna see explosions and uncle Sam kick some serious *beep*, but its not worth a rental",Red Dawn

The premise seemed right out of an ultra-conservative's fever dream and the ""message"" incredibly corny. But that fantastic score by Basil Pouledouris (who did the music for ""Red October"") kept me from reaching for the remote every time this film popped up on cable. And I've begun to view it in a totally new light.The film opens in a small town highschool classroom. Appropriate--we're about to get a ""lesson"" ! If you were a teenager in Afghanistan, how would YOU have reached to the Russian Invasion? What would it take to change you from an ""average"" soccer-playing, chore-laden kid into a bloody-minded Mujihadeen? And just how could this transformation have take place? The film actually handles this rather well, as we watch the ""Wolverines"" go from naivete to outright nastiness, their psychological evolution paralleled by that of their costumes -- team jackets and jeans giving way to scavenged military garb. The crude propaganda pumped at their hapless parent Internees, who show such pathetic courage as they warble a quavering ""America"" before the firing squad cuts them down, may seem ""over the top"" to a Westerner. But would it seem at all absurd to an Afghani--or other unfortunate National -- facing a brutal invader from a thoroughly Oppressive regime?

By the way the opening parachute scene was filmed less than a mile from my Aunt and Uncle's house in Las Vegas, NM. Great, no, but who cares. It is as valid a movie as the silly Easy Rider, or any of the other movies that try to pass on a political message.

254,malachiX2000-1,Great if your ten years old or seriously crazy. Amazingly bad otherwise.,1,19 April 2007,"So lets cover what happens in this movie. The Russians decide to invade the USA by sneaking in via Mexico. The first target the Russians chose to hit when invading the world's greatest super-power is none other than............a local high school in a small town in the middle of no where (a strategic stroke of genius if ever I saw one). Unfortunately for us, the high school was apparently the majority of the USA's military and now the whole country is on the verge of being ruled by the Soviet Union. And the Soviets aren't taking prisoners either. After murdering everyone in the school, they proceed to execute every American who they deem as a threat and eventually reach Nazi-levels of genocide. But when all seems darkest, a force of freedom and righteousness comes to liberate the Country. A force powerful enough to halt the Soviets in their tracks. A force made up of............about six teens with a few civilian guns. Ummm....yeah.I remember when my friends and I used to play war as a kid. We came up with much more easy-to swallow scenarios than the one this movie is based on. I have a feeling that if we'd ever taken the time to film one of these games, our movie would have been a lot better acted than this one too. Most of the brat pack cast give some of their worst performances of the 80s (which is saying a lot) and the Russians tend to sound like they wandered in from a bad SNL skit. That said, it's hard really to blame the actors with such a awful script to work with. The only bright spot in the film is Milius's direction of the action sequences which is occasionally striking though not nearly enough to save this film. If you like Milius's style, watch Conan the Barbarian instead. At least that film knows that it's fantasy and makes its campiness work for it rather than against it.I'm sorry I don't share the love for this film that some do. I think it's because I'm not completely and utterly crazy. Perhaps if I was, I'd enjoy this paranoid conservative wet-dream.

The following portrayal of young people defending their families, country and way of life is what occurs in any land where a foreign power occupies. Roger Ebert reviewed this film by saying that the premise was ridiculous. Children never fight in wars.And the film would have been more accurate if it showed teenagers letting the air out of Soviet tires. What a ludicrous idea! In such a scenario any resistance would be met with the same penalty i.e. death.Many of the resistance fighters of the 20th and early 21st century have been children, I refer to the gallant people of Afghanistan during both the Soviet and current US occupation as well as to the Chinese, Fillipino (correct spelling by the way), Russian and French partisans of WWII.What I saw on the screen was what might have happen if the Soviet Block had attempted to invade our country. This kind of invasion may still occur but this time it will be our UN ""allies."" Currently there is a UN treaty up for a vote that will overturn the US Bill Of Rights. If signed by our ambassador and not vetoed as is expected there will be a movement to resist the treaty's implementation. As US forces may not be used against American civilians per the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 UN ""peace keepers"" will be mobilized to subdue the ""insurgents."" I assume if this film was remade today the title might be ""Blue Dawn.""",Red Dawn

264,boris78,Bad movie,5,13 December 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSRed Dawn started out well. It had an exciting beginning, but then it got stupid. Why would the soldiers waste their RPGs(Rocket-Propelled Grenades) on a school? Even how the Soviets invaded the United States is stupid. They get into the USA on Airliners. Wouldn't air traffic controllers notice that there were a few thousand extra airplanes on radar? And how did they get all those airplanes past Western Europe. They couldn't do it by the Pacific, because the US has several territories and one state there. And why wouldn't Western Europe help? They owe it to the US for their help in WWI and WWII. Also, the Soviets knock out the Nuke silos in North Dakota and they destroy a few major cities. The US still would have hundreds mobile nukes all around the country which they wouldn't hesitate to use if the Soviets nuked US cities. The Soviets also kill 400 million Chinese. The only way they could do that is with tactical nuclear warfare. The Chinese also have nukes and would be able to nail Moscow. This story also describes the Russians as merciless, and they really aren't(especially since most of this movie took place when Gorbachev was in power).The General Plot is dumb. It taught me that if I would gather all my friends and equip ourselves with hunting rifles, we would be better than a Soviet armored cavalry division. I won't deny that the action sequences are good, but they don't make up for the stupid plot.Though my IMDB name is Boris, I'm not a Russian, and am not giving this movie a poor review because you might think i am. I have lived in America my entire life, and I still think this movie is incredibly stupid.3/10",Red Dawn

If, however, you want to ponder the possibilities of what we once thought impossible, with a little adventure and tension thrown in, you should catch this film. Even though the whole ""small group of kids vs the world"" is an over done concept, the movie is riveting in its own way. Made in 1984, it was considered unrealistic, and some of the the events may have seemed absolutely ridiculous, but since then many things have happened in the world that give this movie an eerie sense of being possible. SPOILER WARNING: For example: The invaders use a commercial airline to sneak their soldiers in for their first invasion attack. In 1984 we would have scoffed at that idea. Since September 11th, it isn't so ""laughable"". The idea of sneaking massive forces in through the Mexico border was laughable in 1984. Not so much so in 2007. Europe abandoning us to take care of ourselves was another ""too familiar"" touch.The use of technology, the combination of ""french underground"" like existence and 20th century situations is fascinating to watch unfold.

266,x_soldat,Outstanding Insurgency Film,10,4 July 2003,"Somebody did their homework when putting this film together.  Red Dawn is essentially a visual handbook on the conduct of guerilla operations against an enemy who has otherwise overwhelming superiority in main battle tanks, troops, logistics, etc.  Taking lessons learned in combat in such places as the Russian-Finnish Winter War of 1940, Vietnam and the countless low intensity conflicts in between, the directors bring these lessons home to America.   It's also a commentary on honor, duty, love for one's family and county, as well as indominitable will.  Commies and Lefties will hate this film because it reflects the truth of Soviet methods of invasion and occupation (recall the initial invaders are Cuban troops, such as the 50,000+ proxy troops sent to Angola during the 1970- 1980's).  It shows their brutality and use of local records to round up weapons from 'registered' gun owners.  It shows their use of the love of one's family members as a weapon, by taking part of the town hostage and eventually executing them.  But mostly, the Soviets hated it because it showed how they can be fought and defeated, such as in Afghanistan and Angola.  In Marines v. Special Forces wargames, we often shouted ""Wolverines!"" when attacking at night.  Overall, 9 out of ten points, with another added for getting this film made in Leftist-controlled Hollywood.

This movie succeeds on more levels than it gets credit for. It has been downed for its unrealistic nature, but anyone who has spent time in the mountains, and around the people of this nations heartland see it for what it is. It is an instruction on how small partisan groups can and would fight in the time of national emergency. Historically like circumstances happened in Russia during the German invasion, as well as Vietnam and largely any conflict of the modern age. Who are critics to say that the people of the United States would not be capable of such resistance? A principle misunderstanding that I have seen about this film stems from the fact that people do not understand that the Wolverines are not fighting, except for their ill-fated trip to the front lines, anything better than garrison troops. One should note once the true Russian Army comes on the scene, the Spetsnaz Airborne, things radically change for the main characters. People should view this film with a critical eye focused on what they would do in the same situation. Would they roll over and give up or would they fight. I choose to fight.",Red Dawn

However, as usual, liberals always miss the point. Instead of glamorizing war, Red Dawn shows how terrible war is, what a waste it is, and the futility of occupation. It does a descent job of depicting soldiers at their best and worst. The storyline has a few holes, but IMHO they are small holes. It is also a good primer on survival skills as well as guerrilla warfare tactics. You should keep in mind that this is an 80's flick, so it is full of all of the typical 80's goodness and badness. Also, it's fun to see a ton of stars before they were really famous. Overall, however, Red Dawn was a thoroughly enjoyable two-hours of my time.",Red Dawn
271,Gungrave,Misunderstood? What's to misunderstand?,7,24 January 2006,"Well, I cant honestly say this movie evoked any sort of political argument or emotive response from myself, unlike a lot of some of the reviewers on here (in fact a few seem to have taken the film or its reviews as a personal affront!). The film was an entertaining, nostalgic and highly commercial action movie from a time past.....and on a base level I just plain enjoyed it. It made me smile! The trailer reminded me of a video game called Freedom Fighters (set in New York, you play the part of a plumber leading a resistance force against a Russian invasion) which I had enjoyed too, i liked the premise, so my flatmates and I (2 English, 1 Irish and 1 American) sat through the movie last night. Once the giggles from the girls had subsided (yes Swayze and Sheen look like babies and have not aged too well!) the opening parachute invasion got quite a buzz. Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the B-movie ethic to settle in, but once over that the premise really started to work, and you could actually begin to empathise with the kids in their situation. The story became a bit strung out in places, the action was cardboardy and basic and the acting was...well....not there really, but I don't think that was down to a lack of talent. But it hung together, and we all enjoyed it. Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea. I understand that America has it's extremists who hide in the mountains, stash mountains of weapons and food for just such an event, but the movie certainly doesn't satirise them. The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys ""cold, dead hand"" falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states. The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational, not political, and just about manage to hold some water. The movie is and was just a great ""what if.....?"" and an amusing 80's Hollywood schtick action movie, no more, no less. If a backstory of a continued Cold War was introduced I can well see this being ripe for a remake, and perhaps then you can apply your knee-jerk reactionary theories to it with more basis then...who know?",Red Dawn

I've always been fascinated with the cold war, and the what if scenarios. If you can relate, then this movie is a must see. I thought this movie showed a very strong human side to the realities of a partisan's life, and I believe it was fair. It wasn't an American Rambo, where one man takes down a whole Soviet battalion. No it was a powerful story of what people must conform to in order to deal with the outcome of invasion of ones motherland, and how people, the ordinary person deals with this reality and how they're transformed by it. The United States has never been invaded, and I found this film to be a great prediction of how if an invasion ever took place the American people would fight to the bitter end if they had to. In a way these partisans reminded me of the Soviet partisans of WW2, and how they fought on. This is a great movie which is not overdone, but is very realistic, and fair.

At the time this movie was made, the USSR was our bogeyman. If nothing else, this movie showed that no matter how bad things are, no matter how powerful the enemy, America will never submit. Red Dawn reminds me of ""Green Berets"" in a way; perhaps not the best writing or acting, and perhaps too gung-ho for most people, but appealing on a basic patriotic level.

The weapons were realistic (except for the Hinds having the wrong number of rotary wings and the slowness of the RPGs, but hey, still it was pretty darn good)  While some think the plot was not terribly realistic, remember the time it was made.  This movie addressed many of the fears of Americans during the height of the Cold War, and provided both a patriotic message (America does not suck) and a humanitarian one (war sucks).  Some say this movie was propaganda.  I disagree.  It portrayed both sides as being human:  There were both good (the boy outside the friendship center) and bad (the would be rapist/thief tank crew) russians, a good cuban, and good and bad (Robert, when he got too eager to kill, and Darryl's dad, for selling out his own son) americans.  This is not a film which demonizes one side, it portrays both sides as being made up of people, regardless of what their leaders do.  Also of interest was the reference to the 4473s...the infamous ""yellow sheet"" and the bad uses of gun registration.  I bought this film in the mid-80's, and watch it every so often, still.

In short, this lack of personal experience of the time period sadly makes it impossible for anyone to experience the film like those of us who saw the film in 1984. As you age and mature, you will comprehend further the intricacies involved with films such as this as they relate to the time period during which they were released.--GG: The film was an entertaining, nostalgic and highly commercial action movie from a time past.-ME: That was far from the intent in 1984.--GG: Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the B-movie ethic to settle in-ME: It took that long because it was never a B-movie, nor was it ever intended to become such. In fact, there was nothing low-budget about it when it was made.--GG: The story became a bit strung out in places, the action was cardboardy and basic -ME: You are comparing it against today's scripting and sfx technology. Also, it was 20 years old when you saw it and the film or tape had degraded significantly. The film, when new, had a greater realism. Thankfully, films now are digitalized immediately or even filmed digitally; this means much less degradation, if any, for future generations.--GG: Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea.-ME: They would have been unmistakable had you been an American teenager in 1984, when Ronald Reagan was at the height of his presidency, and the Cold War was at its coldest.--GG: The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys ""cold, dead hand"" falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states.-ME: The bumper sticker, whether it was intended for humor or not, isn't as much a joke as it is a warning as well as a statement of determination. Most Americans understand the 2nd Amendment is there to keep us safe from foreign and domestic invaders.--GG: The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational, not political, and just about manage to hold some water.-ME: Again, you weren't there. ;c) Every generation has these; the only difference is the subject matter.--GG: The movie is and was just a great ""what if.....?"" and an amusing 80's Hollywood shtick action movie, no more, no less.-ME: It was never an ""80's amusing shtick action movie"" in any way, shape or form. It was an intensely serious drama - a dialog with teenagers of the time, expressing what a lot of us were feeling and thinking at the time. While every film endeavors to have a funny moment or two, there was never any intent humor beyond that. Had you been a teenager at the time, you would have found the film to be rather profound any many ways and haunting for a very long time.--GG: If a backstory of a continued Cold War was introduced I can well see this being ripe for a remake, and perhaps then you can apply your knee-jerk reactionary theories to it with more basis then...who know?-ME: Funny you should mention that... http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0183471/ It boils down to you were not privy to the reality people carried into the theaters back then. The Cold War was as pervasive in everyday life then as terrorism pervaded daily life in the years following Sept. 11, 2001. This movie played very well into those fears and political views of 1984, especially of those under 18.By the way, the reason most didn't like the movie as much as they otherwise would have back then was because many people would have preferred an alternate ending.

The US was weak and allowed itself to be infiltrated by aliens. As the war started a standing army was waiting on US soil to be used by foreign aggressors. If we don't keep the pressure on in the war in foreign countries as well as improve our security within our own borders the war will undoubtedly come back to US soil as it did on 911.

I loved its unabashed courage, patriotism and flag waving..so sue me! Only one other similar movie has ever been made to my knowledge; a TV movie about a Soviet invasion and occupation of the United States called ""Amerika"", that was absolutely pathetic. In THAT movie, Americans were depicted as weak, whimpering wusses..and it made me want to puke.It's nice to hear that a remake is being planned..but if they make it into a politically correct piece of garbage, I know I'll hate it.",Red Dawn
292,dansedu,I wish American patriotism was still this high.,7,28 December 2006,"To truly appreciate this movie, one has to understand its context. Americans actually had to deal with the day to day reality that perhaps diplomacy would not win out in the end and a very vicious, autocratic foreign power wanted to wipe out our way of life and could have had the means to do it.Yes, it preys upon the fears in the collective consciousness of its time. Yes, it is VERY violent. Yes, it is cheesy. But it's true saving grace are the CHARACTERS' development. Almost all of the cast went on to high profile, lucrative careers. That success is no doubt in part due to their REALISTIC, CONVINCING portrayals of hometown, USA young people. It explores war's effects on human relationships and loss of innocence in people who are contrived to remind you of someone you know. This level of character development is something that simply does not occur in Hollywood today with its' over-reliance on special effects and action-cam shots. You can't have lived in this era and not feel a rush of national pride after watching this movie.",Red Dawn

But what's good about it, is the premise that some American teenagers wouldn't just take the loss of their freedom lying down! (This might be considered a spoiler, but it's only a very mild one...) The high-school team, the wolverines, becomes a freelance commando team, the wolverines... Yes! And the scenes where they have to decide just who they are, morally, while they kill and are killed...

296,johnbarrar,Great Movie (Spoiler),8,29 January 2007,"First of all you must take into account the time period when judging the special effects and acting skills (not a whole lot of ""great"" acting in the 80's). That being said this film was ahead of its time and thought provoking. It's a fantastic ""what if"" scenario that at the time seemed possible and in view of recent events is actually more possible today. In a time where the indoctrination of our young people toward communist appeasement tendency's; this should be required viewing for all people in the public school system. The premise of how the Mayor turns his own son in to be ""bugged"" as to find the others is particularly chilling to me as this precedent seems very prevalent to me. The Mayor in the town, cooperates, colludes, and attempts to appease the invaders in this film as a coping reaction and does severe harm to all involved. It seems an accurate reflection of current mind sets in some leadership circles. If you doubt that there are those who would attempt such a thing (if they had the resources) then you are badly mistaken. Of course it sets a perfect storm scenario and while not a probable outcome it is plausible. If you are a fan of 24 you will enjoy it and identify with its message.",Red Dawn

I was so totally scared that some group of anti-democratic terrorists would come and invade the country. I think I had nightmares about it for weeks, especially after the scene when they attack the school and the children are being shot. I never understood why the parents ended up in the POW camp and the kids were able to waltz in and speak to them. I have to say this is a pretty good movie, it does come across as an anti-soviet, pro USA movie, but didn't any movie of the 80's do the same? Remember Spies Like Us? I think it is worth a look, I am sure it will be quite dated now, but for those of you who enjoy going back in time I would recommend it.

Wait, a major world superpower forcibly invading a sovereign country with the intention of installing it's own style of government? Throw in the references to the Soviet's despicable invasion of Afghanistan (Its the 80's remember) and this movie is perfect for anyone who can enjoy a big, yummy, spoonful of socratic irony.Even if you can suspend disbelief to the point where it's plausible that a handful of untrained teenagers can massacre scores of elite paratroopers the movie will still force-feed you clichés until you feel physically ill.The invading Soviets enjoy nothing more than wholesale destruction, not to mention killing and/or raping just about every American they can find, while the stoic young resistance fighters variously avenge their parents or 'become men' in a yawn inspiring fashion.All in all this is a film for those who just want to laugh at what filmmakers used to get away with or Patrick Swayze's attempts to be a brooding, manly leader.",Red Dawn

Not only that, the dialogue and character relationships was unrealistic and corny. The only pros I see about the movie was that the action scenes were done well (except for all the unrealistic writing of WOLVERINES on every last thing) and there were beautiful landscaping shots.

303,dino_hunter_2,Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it a Pile of Crap? Hell no! Just the mindset of the Cold War in a nutshell,7,25 February 2013,"Before going into this movie, one must understand the time when the movie was made; 1984. The Cold War was still in full swing. People were still worried about the Evil Commies either invading us or Nuking us. This movie sums up those fears in a nutshell.The Movie is about a bunch of kids who decide to fight a Guerrilla War against the invading communist forces that are oppressing the people of their hometown. At first, the basic storyline sounds incredibly stupid and far fetched (even by cold war standards) and it starred several actors who were either already well known or later became well known.The dialogue isn't too bad (except the first few lines prior to the invasion) with some very memorable sequences and quotes (WOLVERINES!!!), and the characters are all well done; the kids themselves are believable and show emotion quite well (especially compared to it's 2012 remake). Heck, even the Communist forces are given a fair amount of screen time, with one of the commanders having seconds thoughts about WW3 by the end, (Something which is non-existent in the remake).The Action sequences themselves are quite entertaining and well set, especially concerning that these kids have no prior experience in warfare.However, the one thing that impressed me about this movie was it's attention to detail: All the tanks and firearms are correct (and if not, heavily modified to resemble the correct weapons/vehicles). Heck, even the Soviet Propaganda in the town during it's occupation is very believable.The only flaws of this movie are the fact that some suspension of disbelief is required (How are the kids able to slaughter and entire Spetsnaz brigade, who are among the best trained special forces in the world?), and that it's obviously dated (Most kids don't know what Communism is let alone the Soviet Union) and a few minor pacing issues.Overall, I think this is a pretty good movie that you should check out if you are a fan of 1980's action movies, cold war movies, or even any sort of action movie for that matter.",Red Dawn

306,withhold_name,A cut above the rest - which ain't saying much,6,9 August 2009,"*********************Spoiler Alert************************ Much of the technical criticism mentioned by others of ""Red Dawn"" is justified. The notion that a group of untrained teenagers could take on even a poorly motivated army like Cuba's or the now-extinct Soviet Union's is not credible. The best part of the movie is watching the teenagers struggle with the morality of guerrilla warfare. I give it a 6 out of 10.But ""Red Dawn"" is well worth watching for one reason. It represents one of the last movies Hollywood put out that did not look like a joint venture between the Democrat National Committee and Code Pink.Even in 1984 the ""blockbuster"" mentality was already changing the face of Hollywood. Every year lefty movie studio moguls churn out brain-destroying fare such as ""Syriana"", ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""W"", ""Rendition"", ""Stop Loss"", ""Che"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"", and ""Redacted"" by the truckload. All of these movies were wildly popular with critics, and not a few won major awards. All of them (not coincidentally) flopped at the box office. If it were not for blockbuster movies like ""Spiderman"", the ""Star Wars"" series, ""Transformers"", and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy riding to the rescue like the cavalry, Hollywood would require a Federal bailout of epic proportions (pun semi-intended).But in 1984 there was still some independent thinking to be had in Hollywood. If nothing else, ""Red Dawn"" is interesting to contrast with ""The Day After"", another move that came out at roughly the same time. The latter is memorable for the anti-American paranoia that was rising in power and influence and would soon swamp Hollywood.",Red Dawn
307,cel-vandy,JFM warned us,10,15 September 2009,"John Milius made this whole movie as a warning. I was active duty, northern MI, SAC bomber yard, those who were there will know when and where. This was the real deal. The premise of ""civilian airliners"" being used as weapons of war, if we where made to think there was no threat, no problem. Milius is a thorn in Hollywood. He is one of the few brave enough to come out and tell the truth and sound the alarm. One scene tells it all for those who pay attention. The soviet general commands the Cuban officer: ""Go to the gun stores, get the form 4473, that will tell us where the guns are"". How clearer can you be. John was warning us of what could happen if certain information was made to be kept at the ease access of invading armies or political enemies to freedom. A fascistic force first takes down the hard targets, the ""peasants"" that can fight back. It is true today, senior officials of the former ""evil empire"" were known to have said that they feared invading the states. Too many of us were in a position to fight back, they did not have the forces to take all of us out at once. It has been twenty five years, Swayze is dead, he is lionized as the dirty dancer stud, before that he was the leader of the resistance. Sad that in today's society your ability to float around a stage is more important that your ability to take point to defend the one place where those who wish to smear us are freely allowed to do so without penalty of death. Like it was back in the bad old days in the ""Sov Block"". Who is our new ""Hero""? Some long haired ball capped bozo who screams about the evils of the American everyman, the capitalistic system that has made us what we are and our ability to show care and compassion to all in times of need even if it bankrupts us. Even if they broke the law to be here, they are humans first and receive the same treatment. Not that I would want anything to happen to the bozo from MI who hates us, but if he had suffered a serious incident while down in the workers paradise of ""Benevolent Brother Fidel"", how fast would he have been on a flight directly to the best university trauma ward in Miami? I will give Swayze a big thumbs up, stayed with one woman for a long time, was not known for catting about. Funny how Hollywood/mainstream media giants never put that at the top of the story. On the whole Pat was a regular guy, played some real down to earth dudes. Can't really remember him spouting off on issues he knew nothing about. He had a talent and did well at it and stuck to it. We will miss him. Ain't many on the left coast like that anymore.",Red Dawn
308,hscorpion85,Best movie ever,10,18 May 2017,"Red Dawn (1984) is one of the best movies ever made. The movie is about a group of friends that love their homes, country, and families, and is deeply meaningful. Its also about kids maturing to adults during an ultimate 'what if' scenario.Some of my favorite scenes include:Jed writing the names of his loved ones on pride rock, including his own and Matti's, so they can be remembered after they die. The group's debate and turmoil over Daryl's betrayal. The cold hatred of Robert to shoot a life long friend. Daryl stumbling to pull down Robert's mask in a gesture of 'who have you become,' and Robert jumps on his horse and rides away. The next scene when Jed is crying in the forest. This is especially meaningful because earlier in the movie Jed's Dad asks him to never cry again, and Jed later instills the message to his friends when their families are killed, ""never cry as long as you live"".. but after Darryl dies, Jed sneaks off to the woods to cry alone. Robert sawing off the barrel of his shot gun.. Dani says, ""they were people"", and Robert, ""yeah well so was my Dad."" Tony asking Jed to kill her so that the Russian's won't torture her, and Jed can't bring himself to do it. Instead he kisses Tony goodbye on the forehead as she passes away. Aardvark defiant ""Wolverines!"" and later Aardvark running into the Cuban tent, speaking in Spanish to the soldiers, ""follow me quickly"" into the Wolverine's trap. Matti reminiscing through old pictures saying to Jed, ""Its hard being brothers""Robert to Erika, ""If you didn't love any body you'd never even be here"" The soundtrack and the drums.The overall themes of this movie include being self sufficient, tough, and defiant in keeping with one's principles. Examples of this include the citizens singing America the Beautiful right before being executed.. Jed yelling to the political prisoners ""We're all going to die, die standing up."" Darryl being an Eagle scout.. Jed and Matti hunting and camping.. Robert's dad owning a supply store.. The rancher guy owning horses..The movie also does a good job portraying the psychologies of many characters on both sides affected by a prolonged conflict (i.e. Robert, Erika, Colonel Bella) .Lastly to comment on reviews about how this movie is unrealistic because Russia could have never invaded US during the 1980's or that kids can't fight Spetsnaz. (Because Fast and the Furious, Ironman, and most every movie made could receive stronger criticisms than Red Dawn about being unrealistic)... I would point out that French freedom fighters, with little experience, fought the Nazis in WW2, and both Iraqi and Afghan insurgents have effectively fought the best trained US forces for years. I would also point out that the Wolverines were initially fighting occupation forces behind the front lines which are typically not trained well. In the first fight scene the Wolverine's ambush three sight seers, and in the second fight scene Tony plants a bomb in a cafe, not too unrealistic. As the Wolverines gain experience over months, including from Colonel Tanner, they become better fighters.",Red Dawn
309,jgray0075,shallow critics eagerly overlook some unique elements,8,15 January 2005,"This movie tends to get a lot of bad comments. Many critics like to brand it as too patriotic, unbelievable and silly. I think they are overlooking the main premise of the movie. First of all, it is an interesting idea. Many good 'what if' movies were made during the cold war. This one was different from most in that it did not show its 'what if' scenario from the perspective of world leaders or the military participants. It showed from the perspective of a bunch of scared kids. One fact often overlooked in the harsh criticism of this movie that it actually had some very believable elements. One of the more surprising elements is that these high school kids did not react to the invasion by running out and taking on the whole Soviet Army. They actually grabbed as many supplies as they could as fast as they could and ran to the mountains to hide. They did not engage any of the Warsaw Pact military until they were discovered by some Russian Army sight see-Er's. And had to kill them to defend themselves. This first sequence of scenes shows a very disorganized and amateur effort which was very believable. The after effect was the realization that they had now put themselves in a position where they had to fight. Whether that would be true or not, it is conclusion they came to in their discussion later that night. And again, I find it very believable that a group of teen agers in that position would come to that conclusion.So, as time progresses and the movie goes on; these teen-agers get better at staging ambushes and creating havoc for the Soviet army and its allies. Of course it is a Hollywood movie and its going to be unrealistic in the way it portrays battles. But another point that critics of this movie overlook is that this kind of thing has actually happened in history. The French resistance, the Vietnam war, and the recent insurgents in Iraq. In some of these cases the people who rose up to fight the foreign forces may have had experience in warfare, but in many cases such as the French resistance that was not so. And I would have to believe that an American resistance would be at least as effective as the French were.Another gripe is that this movie is too patriotic. My answer to that is that it was the cold war and the movie is about one nation being invaded by its arch enemy with completely different ideologies. I cannot imagine making a movie like this and leaving the patriotic aspect out. That would be like making a movie about Pearl Harbor and trying to leave out the patriotism and the elements showing how Americans felt about the Japanese aggressors just following that attack.All that being said, of course a group of high school kids would not have been able to have had this kind of success against the Soviet army. But one thing usually overlooked about this movie is that in the end, all but a few of the good guys die. There are real life scenarios these kids had to deal with including confronting one of their own who became a traitor. There was a very dramatic scene which showed Swayze having to deal with that situation and he found that he could not do what he knew he had to do. There are some dark moments in this movie and it is not a happy go lucky shoot-em-up kill all the commies like ducks in a barrel kind of a movie as it is sometimes portrayed to be. Its worth a watch.",Red Dawn
310,chris-kaltwasser,Reviewed by someone alive when it was made...,8,3 October 2012,"Judging this movie in the current climate doesn't do this movie justice. It is an '80s action movie, just not as stereotypical as movies like 'Commando' and 'Missing in Action'. Think back to the Cold War, when the world seemed to be in a nuclear stalemate and the threat of total annihilation was in the back of everyone's mind. When the world information you received came from a newspaper or television. No cell phones. No internet. The most important thing to remember about this particular movie is that it is a work of fiction. As with most action movies of the '80s, the entertainment far outweighs any instructional value. Afterwards, don't expect to be able to fend off invading hordes with the rest of the football team, just enjoy the movie.The story tells of teens that were able to escape initial capture, of invading communist Russians and Cubans, by evading and eventually taking the fight to the enemy. Guerrilla tactics were being employed to harass and disrupt the enemies supply lines. It's a fable born out of the real fear that a great portion of society had during those years. On the surface of the story, it seems almost like the glorifying of war that permeates much of the genre. It isn't until you dig a little deeper towards the end of the movie that you realize the story isn't so pretty. The innocence of youth is lost, or rather ripped violently away from the teenagers. Being forced to fight back against the invaders, the 'Wolverines' (adopted name from their high school mascot) slowly transition from kids to hardened war veterans and all the emotional scars that come with that title. The seasonal changes illustrate it wasn't a quick transition. While it is far fetched to believe a group of high school kids could best a trained army in conventional warfare, they engaged the enemy on their own terms in very unconventional ways. They knew their environment better than their adversaries. They were underestimated by their enemies. Would a real life situation equate to equal 'success'? Highly unlikely...but this is a fictional movie. Overall, it is enjoyable as a stand alone action movie. I enjoy it for a variety of reasons, but I think it stands out in my head as story of perseverance and strength of will. Where the bulk of society was content to submit to the will of the invading enemy, they resisted. How many people would have the intestinal fortitude to stand and fight for their country in the most literal of ways? I've seen this movie multiple times throughout nearly 3 decades...it's a plot that could easily be adapted for modern times. I'm interested on how the remake will turn out...",Red Dawn

Does that make you a terrorist or a freedom fighter?

It was quite patriotic and sad. It was a little sexist, but that was because it was sexist in the 80's, remember? It wasn't too violent. The most violence was when you could see the holes in there bodies when they were shot. I couldn't stop watching, and at time, the suspense was killing me.

I couldn't stand watching Patrick Swaze and Charlie Sheen act so terribly. Not to mention every other young actor/actress in this movie. The 80's must have been a desperate time for movies and music. Both sucked back then (mostly) and this was no exception. I am sorry, but if you think that this was even a decent movie you may want to have yourself evaluated. I am just saying.

316,reviews-788-151928,"Full of action, but lacks character development",5,11 September 2013,"I've watched this classic after ""Tomorrow - when the war began"", which many reviewers claimed to be an ""Aussie Remake"" of Red Dawn. It's funny how remote the Cold War setting feels today – and for a contemporary viewer it might be difficult to imagine the impact a socialist re-education camp in their home country on a U.S. audience during the 80ies.In Red Dawn you see a lot of atrocities, but oddly enough it didn't engage me emotionally like Tomorrow did, which is far more tame and kind of ""politically correct"" (at least in comparison to Red Dawn ). I think it's because ""Tomorrow when the war began"" spends more time introducing the characters, who have clear roles (""the hero"", ""the sidekick"", ""thy pyromaniac"", ""the coward"", ""the religious"", etc.), whereas Red Dawn cuts this to the bare minimum – we're thrown into the action like the kids are, but if someone bites the dust, we've hardly come to know him and therefore care a lot less. Tomorrow also spends more time with the preparations for an attack, so the suspense builds up (""will it succeed?""), whereas Red Dawn jumps directly into the action. As a result, we see a lot of fireworks and shooting in Red Dawn, i.e. if you like an action-packed movie, Red Dawn is probably the way to go, but in my opinion a lot more suspense would have been possible.Concerning ""political correctness"": Red Dawn is very anti-communist – the Cubans and Soviets are shown to violate the Geneva Convention. It assumes a scenario where the U.S. stand alone, encircled by enemies, left alone by all allies. This seems to be a right-wing point of view to me, on the other hand it is the only way to introduce an invasion scenario for the U.S. homeland. This whole background might be a reason for some scathing criticism in this forum. On the other hand: If compared to ""Tomorrow when the war began"" where the enemy stays anonymous in order not to raise any controversy, it kind of feels refreshing to see a clear enemy, even if it is a very stereotypical one. Red Dawn surprisingly even features a sub plot in which a Cuban officer is portrayed who develops more and more doubt about whether it is right what he is doing. Obviously, on the U.S. side there is no real bad guy, and during the resistance the hapless teenagers very quickly become experienced, ruthless guerrillas (even with the Che Guevara-like cape, heavy weapons and all, like from an defence industry advertisement). For an 80ies flick I felt it remarkable that the girls are shown as active guerrillas, on par with the guys.",Red Dawn

Its easy to forget how real the idea of war with the Soviet Union was, or the context for how the surprise attack happens as being bases in fact (The Soviet Union carried out a surprise invasion of Afghanistan by using commercial airliners), and the general mind set of the time is shown by looking at other moves of the period, such as the ""Day After"", ""Road Warrior"" and other post nuclear war movies. Recall those years when Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as the Evil Empire, and even the Pope denounced Communism as an evil upon man and you the back drop for Red Dawn.Enter our favorite young actors of the time, throw in a dash of the time period, and a marginally plausible plot and you have Red Dawn. its just a good movie to take you back to those paranoid years of the early 80's, before America's military dominance was a given, when the scars of Vietnam were still fresh upon the political zeitgeist.Yes its dramatic, yes it could never happen, but at the time, it seemed real enough to make this movie into a ongoing classic. So pick up your rifle, head for the hills and help defend the rockies from communist aggression! Red Dawn, its a good movie for the whole family.",Red Dawn
319,rsantmie,Great cold war flick,8,21 September 2005,"If you are interested in a cold war era flick that explores a Communist invasion of the USA and its affects on a group of high school age kids, this is for you.And unlike what another reviewer said, the plan of the Communist invasion is revealed by a downed F-15 driver and does make sense if albeit a bit of a stretch. This film shows how common folks become partisans when their home land is occupied by force. The acting may not be Acadamy award caliber but it's not bad. Besides this stars several well known actors early in their careers.As for not winning any academy awards, remember, the Acadamy gave best costume to ""Ghandi"". Or as I sarcastically say, 1001 things you can do with a sheet.The DVD version offers behind the scenes footage. An interesting tid-bit was the Russian tank in the film was such a good faux that government officials inquired where they bought it, thinking it was real thing.I've found only leftists and liberals hate the film, enough said.",Red Dawn
320,pyramidlove001,Amazing Drama/war movie,9,23 February 2016,"First, let me tell you my political views. I have none. I am independent. I do not subscribe to the polarities of republican/democrat. Therefor this is an objective review, or as objective as one can be.Every actor in this movie gives an incredible performance. And it is a star studded cast. Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen (as brothers), C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Grey, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton. The already good actors are finely tuned here for this epic war drama. There were several parts of the movie where the tears did jerk inside my eyeballs, admittedly. And it's a crying shame that so many people denied themselves the enjoyment of this movie from a sheer dramatic acting and cinematography perspective just because of some silly political views that you really have to search hard to scope out in this movie.Now, that being said, is the movie a product of its time? Absolutely. And that's what adds to the beauty of it (didn't see the remake and will not see it). But it also has many timeless characteristics. Brotherly love, the will to fight with heart and soul for your friends, family and nation. And the question marks it raises, like all good war movies. ""Are we really any better than they are?""Enter this movie with an open mind or better yet, with no mind at all, and it will touch your soul. Period. The end.Have a nice day.",Red Dawn

America has never been invaded by a foreign power. We are used to seeing textbook images and film footage of small European towns in smoking ruins w/ occupying troops, etc. It just seems ""normal"" to us through the process of learning history. It was particularly striking to me to see these images played out in an American town.2. I thought the movie was particularly brutal w/ respect to the murderous aspects of war. In particular the scene on mountain overview where the kids make their first kills...tentatively and almost accidentally. Aboslutely chilling.",Red Dawn

I (and my brothers) all thought it was a fantastic movie when it came out, and to be honest, my opinion has not changed. Leaving aside the implausibility of the premise - that Cuban forces spearheaded an invasion of the U.S. - the whole thing was a hoot. It is also a homage to war/resistance movies; I remember that one of the scenes (where codes to the resistance are gong out over the radio), is taken directly from WWII movies (e.g. The Longest Day, using very similar code phrases as those provided to the resistance in occupied France). It was also has excellent cinematography. There are also some fantastic lines in that movie. Highly recommended!",Red Dawn

It's rather pathetic actually that people would criticize it like that. Russia at the time was a huge problem to us, and even is still to this day. It shows how communism/socialism is doomed to fail under every circumstance; and I love it! I'm a patriot myself, and I can relate to this movie at every turn! I loved the scenes where they were in the woods just surviving with hunting rifles; it made me want to be right there with them. It showed a great version of what would happen if this ever happened, and it's what makes America great. Every tough situation the USA had been in, we always come out on top.

Hence, you have what is nothing short of an American propaganda film. The idea of a Soviet Union lead coalition invading America was unrealistic even at the time but it nevertheless leads to a very fascinating premise for a film.The opening scene with the Cuban army parachuting onto America soil and the Soviet army parading through the streets after successfully occupying the city are excellent.There are probably just a few too many corny clichés within the film for it to be considered a classic but it also surprisingly doesn't hold back on some genuinely gruesome moments too.In terms of war films, it doesn't come anywhere near to the likes of Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan.

This great Film shows how potent a Force that Freedom is. The Wolverines (as the high school kids fighting the Russians are called) are the symbolic descendants of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as they fight Tyranny and fight to get back their country. A great scene of Survival and the concept of Total War that is needed to win is when they are deciding what to do with a Russian Prisoner. Almost everyone is thinking they can't shoot him, but then one of the kids fires his machine gun into the Russian while screaming Because We Live Here. War is Hell.

326,Kamikaze895,Terrible,3,17 October 2011,"This was so terrible, I decided to write my first review, so try not to be too harsh on me.The basic plot is that a rural town is under siege by a Russian-Cuban army and a group of teenagers escape and try to stop it, seems plausible, right? Maybe the acting can save it? Nope, the acting was terrible, way over the top and very two dimensional. Any emotional scene appeared very contrived and forced. Most of the scenes didn't go together very well either. The majority of the movie consisted of American teenagers killing the Commie invader. However, there was no plan, no end goal, no furthering of the plot by the killings. All you knew was that they were probably killing Commies and because of this the action was very mind-numbing.It was also very ironic that for being a movie where the star-spangled banner Americans defend their homes from the Commies, the only character to show compassion and let a wounded enemy get away is one of the Communists.There is some redeeming value in that not all of this band of rebels aka ""Wolverines"" make it out alive, although this hardly makes it worth watching.Bottom lines is if you are looking for a an action/war movie, stay away from this one unless you're a masochist. It is one of the very few movies that I had to take two sittings to get through.",Red Dawn

I mean, they went into hysterics over it. A similar reaction had taken place, only much more intense with a TV movie titled Amerika (which suffered from a lack of serious editing). By this time, the censorship in the US had diminished in power and such movies could be made, but they suffered mischaracterization and vicious attacks (e.g., Rambo III).I can't speak for others, but one problem that I had with the movie was that I had trouble physically differentiating the different characters. I wish that the group of wolverines would have had some blondes, redheads, blacks, orientals, and they had dressed a bit differently. But that is just me.",Red Dawn
328,nomojmail,Red Dawn is a patriotic film.,10,10 August 2005,"When I see TV Guide's rating for Red Dawn which has always been 1 star, I take offense. However, I understand that it was no doubt rated by a NY liberal who has no love for anything off road, which Red Dawn certainly was.1984 was a tough time for patriots and Red Dawn did much to give us something to watch. Outdoorsy, hunting, gun toting types like myself understood the film. If we were outdoorsy hunting types who were also fans of WWII history then so much the better! As a little rebel kid in the late 60's I used to daydream what it would be like to have to take to the woods with my little rebel pals if we were invaded, not that I wanted it to happen, of course. If you didn't live in those times, then, even with 911, you can have no concept of how real we thought the possibility might be with the Russians, Cubans, and all the bad guys in South America, etc. Anyway, Red Dawn is personal for me because I was stunned. It was like they had lifted my daydreams right out of my head and put them on the screen. You see, we have mountains where I live too and they always figured in my concept of local survival. Add all the patriotic and historical touches and it made a masterpiece. Of course, the TV Guide rates it only one star. It's a shame that they didn't mention that Red Dawn was one of the real early films to run on HBO and they ran it for MONTHS. Everybody, with the exception of the NY critics, were crazy about that movie. You won't find that little fact mentioned in the reviews! It was a runaway hit. It's amazing what that little one star deal can mean down thru the ages as new audiences come along and seeing that low rating don't even bother to see what all the fuss was about! Norm",Red Dawn
329,m7e3k6,Cold War Classic,7,10 August 2005,"Great campy flick that captured the era with a lot more action than the normal brat pack movies of the 80s. Not propaganda, as some contend -- just a legit anti-communist opinion made entertaining. Folks in Cuba still can't watch it, even if they could afford a DVD. Obviously it couldn't be an award winning film, there was no same sex kissing, Hillary wasn't a hero, & the commies were the bad guys... Haven't seen it since 9/11, amazing to watch and think about how the world has changed. The movie is a time capsule. A Soviet general made a comment in the movie that they (Soviets & Cubans) would have to kill all the kids, ""just like in Afghanistan."" Interesting that in real life, the Soviet & US reasons for entering Afghanistan and methods of fighting were so different, as were the results. Red Dawn has some weak acting and it's campy, but it is a Cold War classic; good case study of mainstream American-heartland-style patriotism that's rarely shown in the cinema. Definitely worth showing to your kids.",Red Dawn
330,yellowcardmatt,A fun story of 80s teens fighting Commies,6,7 February 2020,"It's cool to think of yourself in the scenarios of these kids and consider what you would do differently to survive, outwit, and exist in a Communist occupied Midwest. The characters are fine, although we get a limited exploration of most of the kids, most of them have a singular trait (I'm the student body president so I think we should vote on decisions, they killed my dad so now I'm hungry for death). The two lead brother characters get some moments of growth and the emotional tolls eventually catch up to them. The weak points in this movie are the insane pacing. It will go from dialogue to a skip frame of the next month in the blink of an eye. Fights are over immediately and inexplicably. The dialogue itself is strange and feels like an 80s teen movie written by a 60 year old man. It think it's a fun movie to watch when you don't want something too serious or too light, plus the political implications of a WWIII in 2020 is really interesting to investigate.",Red Dawn
331,dansnomis,One of the BEST Movies EVER MADE !!!,10,10 October 2005,"Evidently some people who have commented on this movie have no appreciation for the price of freedom. They haven't lost loved ones, or had to bleed or die to protect their family or country. That's what this movie is about. Struggle against tyranny. Starving out on cold mountain tundra and burning with thirst in the blistering desert, yet tightening the belt and marching on because all you have left is each other. It's about the man/woman/friend next to you and the bond you have formed. It is struggle for ones very survival. This movie depicts how most wars of independence have been fought. Not by great generals or progressive minds but by the young who gave their lives dying for what they believed in/held dear. In that aspect this movie stands out. It captures the friendship, the loss, the desperation, the unclaimed heroics of freedom fighters and patriots. The very first scene of Russian soldiers landing outside a high school put me on the edge of my seat. The kids flight to a family members business where they were armed and provisioned. The hideout in the mountains and the story of the resistance movement they formed is incredible. I highly recommend that everyone watch this movie and maybe they will appreciate the freedom they take for granted each and every day.",Red Dawn
332,BrooklynRedLeg,Red Dawn is a lot better movie than the idiot critics give it credit for being.,10,29 March 2016,"I re-watched the original version of Red Dawn recently. I'm absolutely baffled by the vitriol this movie engenders among its critics. I've seen it referred to as everything from a racist, jingoistic ""Ra, Ra, America"" piece of Reagan-era trash propaganda to an allegory for the Afghani insurgency (which is far closer to the truth). The vast majority, I believe, completely missed the point of the movie. Either they never watched it or simply didn't pay attention.To call it a jingoistic bit of Reagan propaganda is a stretch, to say the least because the reason the ""Wolverines"" take up the insurgency is summed up once in the entire movie: ""Because we live here!"" That, in a nutshell, is the cry of every partisan, insurgent and guerrilla fighter the world over throughout history. They don't do it for ""God, Mom and Apple Pie"" or any of that crap. They do it because their home was invaded, their families were butchered and their enemy is relentless.Another jab I've seen is that somehow the movie portrays the Wolverines as super soldiers that never talk about, let alone experience, the horrors of war. So, somehow, Robert's descent into sociopathy, the deaths of Arturo ""Aardvark"" Mondragon and USAF Lt. Colonel Andrew Tanner, the implication that Toni and Erica were about to be raped (or were) and the eventuality of the war grinding down Jed are all completely and totally ignored.Does the movie involve Commies getting mowed down? Ayep, though I would note that its not front-line troops that the Wolverines usually attack, but troop convoys and rear echelon types....just like what happens in most guerrilla/insurgency campaigns. The one time they attack the Spetsnaz, its a well conceived ambush when the Soviets come blundering into the Wolverines encampment. Somehow, I don't think the critics actually paid attention. Red Dawn isn't a Chuck Norris movie.The other thing is that, unlike in other action movies of the era, the enemies in Red Dawn are not faceless automatons/robots to be blown to kingdom come. Colonel Bella is about as sympathetic an enemy as you can get even though he orders the deaths of the parents of the known Wolverines, minus the Mayor who is Daryl's father. The Soviet Spetsnaz commander Strelnikov is also sympathetic and clear headed. Most tellingly, he says he hates the hypocrisy that warfare produces, that euphemistic language of ""containing the enemy"" and so forth is a bunch of BS. Again, this is not something a mindless robotic enemy would say in a ""Ra, Ra, Ra, USA! USA! USA!"" movie. Anyway, for TL;DR - Red Dawn (1984) is a hell of a lot better movie than the then critics, then or even now, give it credit for being. Its a lot more subversive in its message than ""Kill Commies for God, Mom and Apple Pie!"" as some claim.",Red Dawn
333,imprezzaxx,"Great action movie, great plot, decent undergoing..",7,31 October 2005,"I really liked this movie, I think it shows a subject that is not seen a lot in American movies and should. This film being from MGM, there was a lot of money put into it. Like said before, the makers got the clothing and weapons from the red army right. I liked how there was Cubans and Nicaraguans as well as Russians. The action was top-notch for 1984. Some people said that the teenagers were like card board cut-outs. I disagree, i think u did see them change in character in many ways. Like when the kid shoots Daryl with the AK after finding out Daryl betrayed them. It shows how even tho they did not know too well how Daryl got caught, the kid shot him (his friend) This shows their hatred. another time when Lea Thompson hates Charlie Sheen for being i guess kind of sexist, but then when they separate she hugs him n all. I know this movie was meant to tell a story of a certain are in America. But i wish it was brought out in a more worldly view. e.g. Tells more about the background, the reasons why. Sometimes like when the pilot says to the kids ""when u have two toughest kids on the street there gonna fight one day."" I mean thats retarded, just a lame way to get around explaining y Russia invaded. That was the biggest mistake of the movie. Also i enjoyed how they showed the Cuban Colonal Bella changing throughout the movie. lol then the Russians are seen as cold blooded and fight to their death. They should have shown more about their invaders and there thoughts on it. i gave it a 7 because it hits the right spot many times but this area has so much more potential, wow if I'm ever a director I'm def doing a movie like this. ALSO if anyone here likes this movie and has playstation u should buy it, the game FREEDOM FIGHTERS, its in my opinion top 3 games of all time PS2.

I would hope so. I would have liked to have seen the green berets show up and train them better and arm them with more sophisticated weaponry.

336,HrutNjal,Suspension of Disbelief is One thing; Psychosis is Another,2,2 December 2006,"Anyone who has ever been in the military OR has studied military history knows that for a successful aggressive invasion, you have to have a 2:1 superiority. Let's lower the numbers SIGNIFICANTLY and assume that the invaders could have conquered with a ratio of 0.5-1 (absolute craziness--however, I am willing to ""suspend disbelief"").Since this movie (by the movie's own script line) states that nuke usage was kept to a minimum and ""we are now in a conventional war""--assuming this true, then the Soviet/Cuban and Nicaraguan (what a laugh) troop invasion force strength would have had to be around 70,000,000 (70 MILLION) troops. This also assumes that the CAPABLE fighting population of the US would have been around 140 million (eliminates babies, the elderly, sick, and kids under the age of 8). That would have been a piece of cake given the 1984 demographics.BTW: One of the targets that was taken out was apparently Washington, DC. Who came up with this target? You never take out the decision making center because at some point, if your invasion WERE successful, you need to have politicians to make peace terms.So the Soviets have 70 million versus 140 million. Next question, How does the Soviet Union manage to move 70 million troops (oh yeah....how about all that heavy equipment....tanks, armored troop carriers, etc) to the CONUS {Continental United States)?That is a heck of a lot of troops to move into the US. Something was mentioned about using commercial aircraft for the initial wave. A 747 back then would have held about 350 to 380 persons depending on the configuration. If you wanted to move even a million troops in for the first wave on international flights....do the math yourself.I don't have any problems with ""feel good"" movies and I agree with those who have posted on here that one of the reasons it would be so difficult to invade and take the US would be precisely because HUGE population groups would become militia and fight using guerrilla tactics. There is no doubt about that.I just have a certain level where I can ""suspend"" my disbelief.BTW: We were heavily supporting El Salavdor back at that time. Somehow, the Nicaraguan ""army"" was able to move right thru without our US troops and the El Salvador military making any efforts to stop them.I give the film a 2 out of 10 for SERIOUS FILM ratings. This film is not even close to the league of films like ""The Third Man"", ""The Shankshaw Redemption"", and even ""Saving Private Ryan"". So the IMDb really ought to allow TWO film ratings.....no way to compare something like this to classics.However, in terms of ""unintended"" consequences, this film is a good one to kick back and laugh at (the ""unintended"" points). So my ""Cult"" film rating would be 7 out of 10.This is sort of like ""Taps"" with an actual invasion. I wonder why they did not get some of the cast from Taps to star in this one?",Red Dawn

I was looking out my classroom window in fear the the next five years. My brother and I, even though we fought as kids and teenagers, always said we would do whatever it takes to protect our family in friends if anything like this ever happened, as unrealistic as it might have been. In my time in the Marine Corps, I served with three of the best guys I have ever met (who are still my friends today), and we all cherished the movie Red Dawn. Many of our fellow Marines thought we were stupid for liking such a goofy movie. But how can you not like this movie? It tries to a couple of key messages - 1) Protect your home soil 2) Protect your family, no matter what the cost. If they are killed by aggressors, AVENGE THEM, or die trying!!!!!!!. I remember sitting in my barracks room at Camp Lejuene with my roommate Sgt. Brian Pennington. Our copy of Red Dawn was our prized possession, and we often quoted the movie on field exercises. Sgt. Pennington was the Platoon Sgt. And I was the Assistant Platoon Sgt. We were the senior Marines in the Barracks, and we always tried to set a good example. We were surprised to hear that many of the Jr. Marines had not seen Red Dawn, so we gathered them up and played the movie for them. We were shocked (and disgusted personally) when they said the movie was stupid, and a waste of their time. I started thinking to myself, I am not that old, but what is happening to the youth of America. Just my opinion, but this movie should somewhat inspire everybody. Either way, if you have not seen it, GO TO BLOCKBUSTER. You probably will enjoy it.

The mid 80's was a tough time for everyone...but especially teens. All the dramatic changes that occurred then in every aspect of life. Red Dawn made teens feel like they had some kind of power...the relationship the brothers shared and the unity of the friends fighting such an overwhelming foe...well I guess you just had to be there. Kids getting movies out of retro bins..could not even begin to comprehend the mindset of that time...American or not.

341,ndjohnson22,"Not even remotely realistic, but still worth owning",10,9 October 2010,"*Spoilers* I am a huge fan of Cold War ""what-if"" stories. This film is one of my favorites. Very little of it is realistic. Most of the prologue isn't even fathomable. The entire plot is built around some kids who engage in guerrilla warfare and manage to win virtually every battle they begin. Somehow they amass RPGs, limitless ammunition and the remarkable ability to use and maintain foreign weapons, are made aware of enemy plans in advance, don't deal with any medical problems (such as hypothermia, malnutrition, broken bones, or maybe the inevitable PTSD from killing people at point blank range), and take the time to scrawl ""Wolverines"" on every triumph, including a slide in a projector. Also there is the obviously liberal mayor who sells out some kids to protect his politically adept son! Then you've got the young Soviet soldier calling for God (in an atheist nation?) and all the other soldiers are careless beyond description and are emotionless humans. You know, as opposed to the same as soldiers the world over, kids doing the dirty work of their leaders.Most of it is laughable.But despite all this, it touches some nerves. The Soviet/communist threat was real. We (the United States and Russia) spent the better part of four decades on the brink of nuclear devastation. This film ignores that entirely (no nukes were used), but it still speaks to the fear of not being invincible, the same feelings that have been provoked in a 9/11 US. This couldn't be reflected any better than the fact that the operation that captured Saddam was called Operation Red Dawn.There's a little bit of hero in all of us, whether real or fantasized, and this film evokes those feelings, much like a superhero or sports victory movie. And while I consider this a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn dream come true, like their books, it is FICTION and shouldn't be considered as a realistic possibility. So, enjoy the crap out of it. It's a great flick, one of my favorites from the 80s, with a notable cast and memorable dialogue.
