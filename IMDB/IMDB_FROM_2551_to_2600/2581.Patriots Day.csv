0,SnoopyStyle,Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg,7,22 February 2018,"Various people's lives cross path in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and its following manhunt. It is directed by Peter Berg and starring Boston native Mark Wahlberg.Originally, I feared Mark Wahlberg. He's not the greatest of actors although my bigger fear is that they would make the movie about him. That partly happened. Honestly, I cringed when he started yelling at Kevin Bacon and I rolled my eyes when he showed up to interview the Chinese guy. By placing him in the center of every aspect of the investigation, the movie loses a sense of reality. There is no need for him to be at every aspect of the manhunt. I do love the walk-thru with the security cameras. Otherwise, his role should be cut in half. This shouldn't be a vehicle for Mark.On the other hand, I am overjoyed with the other people's stories. I love the Chinese guy and MIT security guy. This could cut back Wahlberg mugging for the cameras and add work from the other cops. Give me more J.K. Simmons. This movie should not be an one-man story if it purports to show the events in its entirety.",Patriots Day
1,Hitchcoc,Mostly Well Done,8,15 January 2017,"I was hesitant to see this film because most of the events are so fresh in my mind. Fresh is a little overstated because what was going on was broadcast kind of haphazardly in a disrupted time frame. Looking back, I've seen a chronology of the events, but at the time I wasn't sure that, beyond the actual bombing, we were privy to the sequence of events. This movie, for me, did a wonderful job of setting up the events leading to the explosions. I'm not talking about Walberg's mega-character, but the brothers and their plotting. Once all hell breaks loose, there are two focuses. I was pleased that they held back on the carnage. What view we had was enough for a viewer. We all know from the facts that it was even worse than that presented. Next, we have the arrival of the FBI to take over the project. While I accept Walberg's guy as a composite character, I was curious if there were guys in the big warehouse pushing at the Feds. I don't know. Perhaps there were. I was also curious how much Hollywood was involved in Tamerlan's death. I've never heard more than a rudimentary explanation that he was killed in a serious shootout. Was it correctly presented with all the explosions and pyrotechnics? I now I'm sounding a bit nit- picky. I have great admiration for the people who were there (the Godmother of one of my children finished the race earlier). The efforts to catch these guys was Herculean. But how much did they add to an already remarkable story? Oh, and did some survivalist type with a big rifle joint the SWAT team on the roof for the final capture. She is an unknown with a rifle. Really? I thought that was such a lame effort at humor in an incredibly tense situation. Still, I would recommend this film for it's portrayal of a dark time in our history.",Patriots Day
2,Prismark10,Patriots Day,6,23 June 2019,"Peter Berg brings an account of the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013. Three people died over 200 were injured as two bombs went off near the finish line. Bombs placed by the Tsarnaev brothers who were of Chechen origin.Once the bombs go off, Patriots Day becomes a procedural thriller. It focuses on the down on his luck with a bad leg, fictional hero Sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg.)As the film progresses the most interesting and intriguing character is Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) the FBI agent in charge of the investigation. Berg deserves credit for having a nuanced portrayal of the FBI in this film. It is just a shame that DesLauriers is relegated to the background. It would had been a different film with him as the lead but a better one.Some of the characters appear who seemed to be unrelated to the movie's narrative until much later on. An example is the Chinese student Dun Meng who has a frightening encounter with the brothers late at night or Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J K Simmons) the cop in Watertown.The film is uncertain about its treatment of the Tsarnaev brothers. Were they hardened criminals, committed terrorists or just two idiots who could not even get the right type of milk for a baby? At times the brothers appeared to be dim, glad that they were driving a Mercedes.The heroes of Patriot's Day are the people of Boston and the victims. However there is something both glib and empty about this movie using a real life tragedy for a commercial thriller so soon after the events.",Patriots Day
3,nogodnomasters,Love responded in an instant,10,12 August 2017,"This is the story of the Boston Bombing. We are introduced to a number of characters in quick fashion and to Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) a composite character used a a conduit for story continuity. The bombing occurs 26 minutes into the film and the rest of the film concentrates on locating the evil doers who made gross mistakes. What I found surprising was the initial encounter with the police. It was a lot more horrific than what was covered on the news. The production was able to splice in actual footage.In spite of using a composite character, the film was very accurate and emotional.Guide: F-word (It's Boston). No sex or nudity.",Patriots Day
4,kosmasp,Boston Marathon (Hunt),8,3 January 2021,"Any time someone blows something up with the intent of killing innocent people (let's not get into a who is really innocent discussion), it can be seen as an act of terrorism. Of course if the culprit is a white male, media and the public are not really going the terrorism route and give those assailants the ""benefit of the doubt"", calling those incidents even ""isolated"".It is important to have those things in mind when it comes to identifying or even leaking to the press who did what. And while the inciting incident obviously is the bombing and the devastating effects of it (injuries vividly displayed), the biggest chunk of the movie is about the hunt for those who commited this attrocious act. Something I did not follow or was too aware of. I just knew the overall outcome of it. The dramatization of the events is quite harrowing and really puts you on the edge of your seat. And all with quite the class actors in front of the camera. I was only aware of Mark Wahlberg, but he has quite the ensemble helping him out (literally too). Not for the faint hearted, but very intense indeed",Patriots Day
5,classicsoncall,"""It's terrorism. We'll take it."" - FBI Agent Richard DesLauriers",8,3 October 2018,"The most compelling part of the movie for me was the detective work that narrowed down the investigation to the Tsarnaev Brothers. It all began with an observant technician reviewing film footage of the crowd and noticing that one of the brothers failed to look in the direction of the bomb blast. I don't know how incredible a catch that might have been unless the viewer was trained in forensics and that was one of the things he was looking for. From there on, a minute by minute analysis of the street scene revealed more detail that brought authorities closer to identifying the terrorists. Simply great detective work, and a testament to the fact that anyone else trying something of a similar nature is bound to get tracked down in a likewise manner.The film wisely stayed away from a more graphic depiction of the horror involved, though what was shown was bad enough. Mark Wahlberg as a composite character was fairly effective, though it did seem too coincidental that he was in so many critical points of the investigation to seem credible. Otherwise, in recalling the news coverage of that week in Boston, it appeared that the film makers stayed close to the mark with the day by day manhunt to eventually capture Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze). The shootout in Watertown seemed a bit exaggerated. but who's to say who wasn't there. Overall, an effective telling of the 2013 Boston Marathon, the bombing that disrupted it, and the aftermath. The montage of real life characters following the story was effective for identifying the survivors and heroes of the event. I notice that being done more and more lately (""Hacksaw Ridge"", ""Sully""), which only furthers the credibility of every day people rising to the occasion when disaster strikes.",Patriots Day
6,jboothmillard,Patriots Day,5,13 September 2020,"I saw the trailer for this movie, based on a true story, in the cinema, it looked like it was going be something worthwhile, it did have average reviews by critics, but I was still up for it, directed by Peter Berg (Welcome to the Jungle, Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon). Basically, on April 15, 2013, on Patriots' Day, Sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) is working the security at the Boston Marathon. During the marathon, the Tsarnaev brothers, Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) and Tamerlan (Themo Melikidze), detonate two bombs, causing widespread panic. Young couple Patrick Downes (Christopher O'Shea) and Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) are separated to different hospital with severe injuries, they are both required to have their legs amputated. Family man Steve Woolfenden (Dustin Tucker) is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo (Lucas Thor Kelley), who is taken by an officer to a safe location. FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) is assigned to investigate the bombings alongn with Boston police commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), while Saunders searches for evidence and helps people that have been injured or separated from their loved ones in the chaos. Footage of the bombing is examined by FBI analysts and they identify Dzhokhar and Tamerlan as suspects, but DesLauriers is reluctant to release their pictures to the public without further evidence. But the pictures are leaked to the press, while men working for Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons) begin a door-to-door search for the pair. On the run, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan kill MIT officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking) trying to steal his pistol, and then carjack student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang), telling him that they committed the marathon bombing and plan another bombing in New York City. Meng escapes after stopping in a fuel station and hides across the street, where he alerts the police on the whereabouts of the brothers after they drive away in his stolen car. Saunders arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan, and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair and an armed confrontation. Several officers are injured in the ensuing shootout, where the brothers use both firearms and bombs. While Tamerlan is shooting, Pugliese fires at his ankle, wounding him and stopping him gathering more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage. Tamerlan takes a last stand until he is subdued by the police. But zhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him and makes his chaos. Meanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist) and Dzhokhar's college friends Dias Kadyrbayev (Elijah Guo), Azamat Tazhayakov (Jin Yang Brancalhao), and Robel Phillipos (Brent Saunders) are brought in by the FBI and interrogated. Russell refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, quoting the Quran, while Dzhokhar's roommates appear oblivious to his plans, despite finding bomb parts in his possessions. Later in Watertown, a local man finds Dzhokhar hiding in his boat and calls Saunders and Superintendent William B. Evans (James Colby). Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff, while crowds from the surrounding neighbourhoods cheer, and Saunders and his colleagues celebrate. The Boston police are invited to attend a Boston Red Sox game, where David Ortiz (as himself) thanks them for their heroism and tells them to ""stay strong"". Dzhokhar was sentenced to death by lethal injection and awaits his appeal in federal prison; his three college friends were arrested for obstructing the bombing investigation and authorities are continuing to seek information regarding Russell's possible involvement in the bombings. Also starring Michelle Monaghan as Carol Saunders, and Michael Beach as Governor Deval Patrick. Wahlberg, Goodman, Bacon and the other actors all do their parts fine, the explosion sequence itself is obviously the most gripping part of the film, but there are some engaging moments in the aftermath as investigators try to track down the culprits, there could have been more build up, and it could have been more thrilling more often, but overall it's not a bad drama based on a true story. Worth watching!",Patriots Day
7,grantss,Surprisingly good,7,1 December 2017,"The events of the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013, mostly seen through the eyes of Boston Police Department's Sergeant Tommy Saunders, plus other people involved, including the perpetrators. We see everything unfold, from the lead up to the marathon, to the bombing, to the manhunt for the killers.Surprisingly good. This is a Peter Berg-Mark Wahlberg collaboration and their previous two movies - Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon - were fairly one-dimensional offerings: based on true stories but extensively Hollywoodized with Mark Wahlberg playing the stereotypical, cartoonish hero. I was expecting Patriots Day to go down the same path (the title didn't help!) and in patches it does threaten to turn into a gung ho, chest-beating exercise with a single perfect hero solving all the world's problems.Those patches are whenever Mark Wahlberg is involved. Everything he does in this movie is overwrought, overdone, overacted, cartoonish, speech-filled and irritating. Thankfully, however, Peter Berg doesn't turn it into a one-man show. There's enough scenes without Wahlberg and these are where the movie is very good. The investigation is intriguing and the sequence of events quite interesting and edifying. Some great action scenes.Take Mark Wahlberg out of it and this movie could have been brilliant.",Patriots Day
8,Calicodreamin,Emotional,9,21 July 2020,A very emotional dramatization of the Boston marathon bombing. The characters were well cast and well acted. The timeline well established and the storyline well developed. The emotions were deeply conveyed through the cinematography and music. Loved seeing the real people at the end.,Patriots Day
9,neil-476,Has merit,8,14 May 2018,"In a mostly true reconstruction of the Boston Marathon bombing and its aftermath, Mark Wahlberg plays a fictitious character/composite policeman.The events portrayed in this film correspond fairly closely with my recollection of media coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent search for, pursuit and apprehension of the perpetrators. I am aware that Mark Wahlberg's character doesn't exist, being a device to enable some sort of narrative continuity to be applied to the a) bombing and b) pursuit elements of the film. Having said that, and much as I like Michelle Monaghan, the fictitious backstory of a fictitious character does not add to the credibility of the movie. Does this justify the excellent scene where Wahlberg returns home to find all his family in his house clamouring for information and failing to take any account of how massively traumatic the day has been for him? I'm not sure.The film is well staged and conveys a strong sense of being there, It is also gripping and entertaining, albeit respectful to the victims. Should films which portray true-life events be entertaining? I think perhaps they should, as long as they don't trivialise what happened to real people, which this film doesn't. An entertaining film conveys important events to a larger audience, which can only be a good thing.Wahlberg is good but, for me, the best scene is Khandi Alexander as a specialist terrorist interrogator, quizzing terrorist wife Katherine Russell (an unrecognisable Melissa Benoist) with a mixture of cosy coercion and clinical coldness.And I was pleased to see that the closing of the film resolved the stories of the people who had been affected, and how they are dealing with what happened to them.",Patriots Day
10,ferguson-6,spirit,6,12 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Is it too soon? If not, is it too painful to revisit? Even if the time is right, is injecting a fictitious supercop into the horrific events an acceptable approach? Every viewer of the film will have their own answers to these questions, but clearly writer/director Peter Berg (Deepwater Horizon, Lone Survivor) and Boston area native Mark Wahlberg believed now is the time and that this is the best way to re-create this catastrophe and its fallout. Wahlberg plays Tommy Saunders, a Boston detective kicked back to uniform duty as penance for a run-in with another cop. His character is evidently a composite of multiple cops and first responders, and though he is the center of the film, the character is the weak link. He's some type of supercop who never sleeps and manages to be literally everywhere something is happening  either the Boston Marathon finish line, FBI control center, the hospital interviewing survivors, or cruising the streets with his spotlight tracking down the bad guys. Beyond Wahlberg's character, the film does a remarkable job at re-creating the tragic events, the emotional and physical fallout, and the urgent law enforcement manhunt. Since it's been less than 4 years, most every piece of this is fresh in our minds. We follow along from when the street cameras are used to identify the suspects all the way through the final capture from the backyard boat.Another thing the film does well is tell the stories of certain individuals who were impacted. We experience the emotions of Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), the preparedness and cool of Watertown Police Chief Jeffrey Pugliese (JK Simmons), the highs and lows of MIT Officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking), the terror and courage of captive Dun Meng (Jimmy O Yang), and the focus and conflicts of Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) and FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon). There is also the story of survivors Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) and Christopher O'Shea (Patrick Downes), and a few others who we get to know a little bit. The bombers/terrorists/brothers are played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze, and no effort is made to sympathize or explain their actions. The closest we get is an argument in the apartment with the wife (played by Melissa Benoist) over the wrong type of milk. I will not use the real names here as I don't believe in providing any publicity for such creators of evil. The film successfully establishes the ""normal"" start to what seemed to be a ""normal"" day. Of course, April 13 2013 turned out to be anything but. We hear the Newtown tribute at the opening of the race, and we see David Ortiz with his color proclamation at Fenway Park. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is always spot on with the mood, and the last 10 minutes are by far the most emotional  we hear from the real life survivors, first responders and others so crucial to that time. I may believe that this story would best be told in documentary form, but there is no denying that it's a reminder of the power of love, and the spirit of Boston and America.",Patriots Day
11,FlashCallahan,Sends a strong message......but too soon?....,7,20 February 2017,"Almost disgraced Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders is taking security duty at the Boston Marathon when an act of terror strikes with homemade bombs.As the wounded are cared for, Saunders and his colleagues join the FBI to get to the bottom of this attack.As the investigation continues, the terrorists realise that the authorities are close and attempt to flee the city to continue their 'work'.A police manhunt is commenced, involving shutting down the City of Boston to make sure the terrorists are captured.Despite the subject being very close to the hearts of many, Patriot's day is quite amusing in it's opening scene, and the chemistry that the screenplay gives the characters is overwhelmingly warm.Wahlberg is quite stunning as the weary Saunders, and you can see the strain the events take on him as the film progresses, much like Vincent's suit in Collateral.The banter between him and Goodman in the opening scenes is so real, that you would be forgiven if you thought they were best friends in real life.Once the film shows the despicable act, it doesn't let up until the very end with it's intensity. But what Berg does, is show a little empathy for the terrorists and their families. Yes what they did was unforgivable, but their quest to escape is just as intense as Saunders and the F.B.I to catch them.There are times when it does veer toward an action film film, rather than it's dramatic credentials state, and this makes those scenes, especially the shoot out toward the end, feel a little 'sexed up' to give the film a little more 'thrill'.But other than that minor flaw, it's a solid film, celebrating the courage of all those who were affected by that terrible event.Just don't get distracted too much by Goodman's eyebrows.",Patriots Day
12,phd_travel,Thorough depiction of the main events,10,11 January 2017,"The events of the Boston Marathon deserved a caring and thorough portrayal on screen and this movie delivers in many praiseworthy ways.The bombing itself is shown but not too graphically. It's respectful to the dignity of the victims. The fatalities are acknowledged at the end of the movie but not portrayed by actors in the movie.The victims. The tragic MIT campus police who was killed and the brave young couple who lost legs are shown. It's so heartbreaking when the camera shows their legs before knowing what is going to happen. There must be some reason why they didn't show more about other individual victims before and after the bombing. Highly recommend watching the HBO documentary about the victims to see their ordeal which would have been difficult to cover in the length of this feature film.The pursuit and capture. The pursuit and capture is masterfully shown. Big emphasis that it was a joint effort between the public and the law enforcement. Kudos to this movie for giving full credit to the Chinese grad student who was car jacked, ran away and identified the bombers to police. Without his bravery the two could have gone on to NYC. The almost stranger than fiction shoot out in the street and capture in the boat and the overwhelmed cops is terrifyingly and searingly portrayed. Well done Peter Berg for showing this in well filmed detail including the identification process from cameras. There is one fault in the movie. There could have been a bit less about law individual enforcement personnel mainly Mark Wahlberg's character and his injured knee kicking down the door which seems so trivial compared to the events. I understand for narrative purposes they needed a central character to focus on, but his pov wasn't the best one to show.The perpetrator's point of view. Tsarnaev brothers are acted by actors who look quite a lot like them - pretty terrifying. Their actions are shown in detail although not the background motivations. Even the misguided classmates who helped shield the younger brother are shown. One of the most chilling scenes is the interview with Katherine Russell, wife of the elder brother. An unrecognizable Melissa Benoist of Supergirl bravely takes on this role. This movie wasn't released before the elections so it can't be called a political movie like 13 Hours. But hopefully people everyone whether left or right will just focus on the victims of the bombing and law enforcement.",Patriots Day
13,trashgang,really good,8,15 July 2017,"Flick about the bombing at the Boston marathon so you know that this is going to be hard to watch because be honest, innocent people died there. The acting was sublime, sadly I can't say of all the things shown really happened that way because the pursuit between the cops and the victims and all the bombs going off in the streets, I can't say if that's true but it do gives this flick a special feeling about the people in Boston all getting stronger out of the attack and working together to hunt down the bombers.All acting is above mediocre, a thing you really need in this kind of flicks. Another nice surprise in a year two real events were transformed in a flick and both are really good (Sully). If you only have seen the bombs going off and do wonder what happened afterwards go pick this one up.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Patriots Day
14,deloudelouvain,Good movie about terrorist cowards,8,9 January 2018,"When I saw the title and read about the story I thought this movie would be another patriotic-we-are-america-and-we-are-the-greatest movie but it's actually very well done. It's not even chauvinistic like I thought it would be. It just tells the story of the Boston marathon bombings. It's a gripping story that won't leave anybody without an opinion on how those terrorists are just a bunch of cowards and nothing more. It doesn't matter if it's about muslim terrorists or any other white redneck terrorist, they are all just the same, a bunch of cowards. In a man-to-man fight they would always bite the dust so they just kill innocents by using selfmade bombs and other weapons. Patriots Day is a bit of a hommage to the survivors and to the people of Boston that put their forces together to catch those cowards. Mark Wahlberg is always good and in this movie he prooves again he's a top actor. Pleasantly surprised by Patriots Day.",Patriots Day
15,SimonJack,Very good film about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing,9,16 August 2017,"Made just three years after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, ""Patriots Day"" tells the story of the infamous event, including the pursuit of the terrorists. The film adds two fictional characters to a plot that includes 281 listed real people from the event. Mark Wahlberg plays fictional Boston police sergeant Tommy Saunders, and Michelle Monaghan plays his wife, Carol. The use of a fictional character is an age-old device in novels and movies about historical events. Where such stories often move back and forth between any number of characters, a fictional character is a focal point from which to view the event as it unfolds. It's a device that works well. This movie also must have set a record for use of the F-word. I don't know if that was fiction or real, but the dialog is riddled with ""F that,"" F this,"" and F it."" If it's real, then the Boston Police Department can be proud (or not) of being the most foul-mouthed of any law agency on film to date.The movie is based partly on two books written about the April 2013 bombings and the capture of the terrorists. The cast includes characters in the police, FBI and other authority roles, and several of the bombing victims. Others were marathon observers and rescue and hospital personnel. Some of the real people are interviewed or shown at the end of the film.This is not a movie made for entertainment, but to look back on a tragic event and to celebrate the local people who responded to help in the crisis. The hoopla about Bostonians coming together after the event, and the bravura that Boston will not be conquered by such events seems too much and out of place. I think the film speaks for itself in showing the responses of so many who helped the victims. The trumpeting at the end of the film cheapens it just a bit. But this is a very good film and slice of life of many people in Boston over four days in April 2013. All aspects of this film are excellent. Why the film didn't receive a single nomination for an Academy Award is baffling to me. Especially since the National Board of Review named ""Patriots Day"" one of the top 10 films of 2016. Nor did it do well at the box office, just earning $50 million worldwide against a budget of $45 million. Why the turnout at theaters was so disappointing may say something about the American culture less than two decades into the 21st century. Hollywood turns out a plethora of fictional action crime films filled with violence, murder and mayhem. And the public flocks to see those films. And millions of people, especially the young to middle-aged, play electronic games of the same type. But when it comes to seeing what happens of this nature in the real world, people don't want to see it. They turn a blind eye. Unlike many of the fiction flicks that show the local police and FBI as mortal opponents, ""Patriots Day"" shows a realistic picture of law enforcement units working together. One scene stands out where there is a disagreement. John Goodman, playing Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, wants the photos of the suspected terrorists released to the public. He notes that people may recognize them and give the police and FBI leads. Kevin Bacon plays FBI special agent Richard LesLauriers who doesn't want the photos released. He wants to get more information and says that releasing the photos would alert the terrorists who would then run. The photos were leaked to the press, and as the movie shows, the terrorists ran. As a result, two policeman died and several others were wounded. Had the authorities waited, they may have followed leads to corner the terrorists in their home. The film shows three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who were convicted for interfering with the investigation and sentenced to prison. When they see Dzohokhar's picture in the press, they don't report it to the authorities. And they find materials for making bombs in his locker. One would hope that these low-life characters aren't indicative of a large segment of the youth in our colleges these days. An even more interesting scene is that in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife, American-born Katherine Russell (played by Melissa Benoist) is questioned. This most likely was recorded, so the film dialog may be what she actually said. In response to a female FBI agent, she says, ""For a Muslim woman, marriage is a lilting dance of duality – strength and submission. Beautiful, selfless, rapturous love of two masters, the carnal and the divine. The life a Muslim woman lives is a dangerous and difficult one, for if she does not submit to her husband, there is a spot reserved for her in hell. Yes. My husband kissed me before he left and he will kiss me again when I see him in heaven. And you can't prove anything.""While Wahlberg's Tommy Saunders is a fictional character, he has one good line toward the end that doesn't have a single F-word. Describing his take on the eve of the bombing to a fellow cop, Tommy says in part, ""That's all I saw today. Good versus evil, love versus hate. The devil hits you like that, there's one weapon you have to fight back with – its love. That's the only thing he can't touch.""This is not a movie for the faint of heart. But it is one most people should see. If for no other reason, than to be aware of the reality and horror of terrorism.",Patriots Day
16,siderite,Formulaic.,6,24 September 2017,"There are two bad guys and everybody else who is hunting them are nice decent Boston folk, sympathetic to the victims and enraged by the pain the bombers caused. That's the narrative of the film and nothing in it changes it in any way.I felt it was a failure of the film to portray every participant as a human being, while the bombers were just barely sketched and when they were shown, they were vilified in the most basic way. We can't fight these people if we don't even try to understand them a little bit. Granted, little is known about the two bombers, but the film has made a lot of effort to show the lives and friends and loved ones of all the other important characters.Also, I remember the public insanity when the pictures were released and everybody thought their neighbor is a terrorist. They barely touched on that.So there it is: a formulaic good vs bad story, based on a real event, complete with short interviews from the real victims while the credits roll. I didn't expect much and it's exactly what I got.",Patriots Day
17,KineticSeoul,Competent movie about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath,7,15 January 2017,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie when I first decided to check it out. To my surprise it's a competently made movie that kept me focused all the way through. I thought this was going to be straight by the numbers disaster movie, which will have some moments that will just drag on an on. To my surprise, it hit the emotional moments at the right moments and focused a good deal leading up the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. And the aftermath when it comes to the people that got effected and the investigation in tracking down the culprits. The narrative is easy to follow and there wasn't any complexity when it comes to the investigation. That includes the simple cinematography that didn't seem to have much techniques put into it. Although some of the characters seemed over-dramatic, yeah it's was a very serious situation but it just felt pretentious at times. Unlike how it was in ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but this is a patriotic movie after all. However the most effective elements is how it shows all angles and perspective of the people that was involved in the bombing. Including the aftermath and what the people had to go through because of the bombers. Mark Wahlberg does what he does, but it works into this just fine and that includes all the other actors playing the people that was involved in the manhunt. The celebration at the end is one of the things I disagreed with in this film. It was probably to make it a good happy ending while showing the people coming together and not letting the bombings bring them down. But I personally think it should have gone in a more grim and dark direction, which shows the seriousness of it all. Despite showing how although the culprits were either apprehended or killed, isn't something to entirely celebrate about. Yes, it's a good thing that they managed to find the people that was responsible and was able to exact justice. I am glad justice was served and the bombers got what they deserved. And sure, it can be a celebration for some folks when the culprits that committed the deadly atrocity is caught or killed off. But after innocent peoples lives that were lost and the damages that was done by just two lunatics with malicious intents. I personally think it should have taken a more serious approach at the end instead of going on a happy we come together ending. It can work when it comes to fictional movies like ""Independence Day"". But when it comes to something that is based on a true event, when it comes to just two simpleminded terrorists causing destruction and affecting the lives of others in a negative way. The happy ending with everyone smiling, laughing and holding hands wasn't the right choice in my opinion. Even if life still goes on after the bombing.

18,sddavis63,Nothing Here Really Connected With Me,3,27 December 2017,"I want to start out with the positive. Patriots Day was a good reminder to me of what actually happened on that day in Boston. Not being an American, I was certainly aware that the bombing of the Boston Marathon had taken place in 2013 but I can't really say that many of the details of the event and its aftermath had stayed with me, in the way that the 9/11 attacks did. So I had honestly forgotten that the hunt for the bombers extended over several days. I didn't remember the police officer who was ambushed by the bomber several days later. I really didn't remember the almost complete lockdown of parts of the city as the authorities closed in on the bombers. So the film was successful in jogging my memory of the events. The testimonies from actual survivors and from others involved in what happened as the movie came to an end were worthwhile, and the tribute to those who were killed (including a 9 year old boy) were sobering. The chaos portrayed in the immediate aftermath of the bombing came across as realistic. So there were some things that worked here - but the basic problem I had with this was that I just didn't find it especially interesting.In all honesty the first 20-30 minutes of this were painfully dull and had me wondering why I was even bothering to watch this. But beyond that, the primary problem I had was that none of the characters really connected with me at all. The movie kind of moved in a bit of a blur. No one stood out and said to me ""I'm the one you need to be watching; I'm the one you need to care about."" None of the victims were really followed that closely. We saw a lot of police work going on - but none of the police officers or other officials made a huge impact. Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Tommy Saunders was supposed to be doing that. He was the main character. The problem was just that, though - he was a character; completely fictional. I'll give the benefit of saying that the character was a composite, but still fictional. So why did I need to know about his wife, or whatever discipline it was he was dealing with as the movie opened? That was totally superfluous - since the guy didn't even exist! And none of the other actors in this really leaped out at me. As the story moved into the hunt for the bombers, there were times when this came across more as an action thriller for entertainment purposes than anything, full of gunfights and little else. I also can't say that I found this especially dramatic. You wait expectantly for the bombs to go off once the movie shifts to the actual Marathon, but aside from that this comes across as kind of flat. There was also no real exploration of the motive of the Tsarnaev brothers, or how they came to the point of wanting to do this.It's a movie that was going to be made. To be honest, it's probably a movie that needed to be made. There were people who deserved to be paid tribute to, and really the entire city should be commended for the way it came together. Those who made this simply needed to do a better job of connecting with the viewer. (3/10)",Patriots Day
19,Hellmant,'UNITED 93' was a much better film!,8,18 January 2017,"'PATRIOTS DAY': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new dramatic thriller, based on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing; and the efforts that law enforcement went through to catch the terrorists responsible. The movie was directed by Peter Berg, and it stars Mark Wahlberg; making it their third collaboration together (following 2013's 'LONE SURVIVOR', and 'DEEPWATER HORIZON' from earlier this year). Berg also co-wrote the screenplay; with Matt Cook, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson. It's based on the book 'Boston Strong', by Casey Sherman and Dave Wedge. The film also costars Kevin Bacon, John Goodman, J.K. Simmons, Alex Wolff, Themo Melikidze and Michelle Monaghan. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's also disappointed at the Box Office (so far). I found it to be a mostly well made, and effective action-thriller; but it's also exploitative, and somewhat corny (at times).The movie depicts the events of the Boston Marathon bombing, as well as the terrorist manhunt that followed (involving the police and the FBI). It revolves around a fictional Boston Police Department sergeant, named Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg), as well as multiple other law enforcement officers. It also briefly tells the story of several other (real life) people, that were greatly effected by that tragic day. The film spends the most time following the two terrorists, Dzhokhar (Wolff) and Tamerlan (Melikidze) Tsarnaev.As an action movie, and suspenseful thriller, I think the film was really well made. Berg is a good action movie director; and Wahlberg, and most of the rest of the lead cast, always deliver in films like this. The movie does seem exploitative at times though, especially when it concludes with an emotionally forced tribute (to the real survivors involved in the terrorist attack). It just seems like the filmmakers are trying to justify the action movie that proceeded it; and I think their forced justification makes them look even worse. The film is also filled with corny caricatures (at times), and exaggerated sentimentality (at other times). It is an otherwise well made, and entertaining, action flick though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",Patriots Day
20,Lejink,Off the pace,3,27 April 2018,"For a film where the actors were obviously carefully selected for their resemblance to their real-life counterparts, (as is made clear by the introduction of the real participants near the end of the film), to pivot the action around an entirely fictitious character (Mark Wahlberg's ubiquitous police officer], surely had to be a mistake. I say ubiquitous because Wahlberg always seems to be Johnny-on-the-spot whenever anything significant happens in the action. There he is close by when the bombs go off, he's there just after the young Chinese boy is kidnapped and carjacked by the two bombers, he's also there at their shoot out with the cops and again when the authorities finally catch up with the fugitive younger brother. Once you know this (it becomes obvious when there's no real life equivalent introduced for him at the end), you realise you've been manipulated as a viewer and it just weakens the whole premise of the film. Surely there were enough brave citizens and emergency services in Boston on the day of the incident without the need for this imaginary person. Otherwise I couldn't say I was entirely gripped as I think I should have been by the depiction of proceedings as they were presented. Of course the story has to follow the real life sequence of events which I don't doubt it did, I just didn't think it was done in a very exciting or gripping way.Fine to celebrate the everyday heroism of ordinary average people when confronted by the unexpected, criminal and dangerous, but stretching it to a two hour movie didn't come off here.",Patriots Day
21,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Thorough, sobering re-enactment of a recent tragedy",9,1 March 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Monday April 15th 2013. The people of the city of Boston come together to watch/participate in the annual city marathon. It is a day when friends, families and acquaintances came together to share a joyful experience- all except for warped brothers Tamerlan (Themo Melikidize) and Dzhokhar Tsarbaev (Alex Wolff) who were responsible for planting and detonating a series of explosives in amongst the gathered crowds soaking up the days events, causing mass pandemonium and devastation, resulting in the maiming and killing of many. Officer Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg), demoted to crowd control after excessive force in his work, is thrust into the centre of this terrible madness, and forced to keep a level head as a city wide manhunt for the evil pair ensues, culminating in a dramatic shoot out between them and experienced Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons) that brought them down.With the dust from their previous collaboration, the similarly real life centred oil rig drama Deepwater Horizon (also, similarly, about comparatively recent events), barely brushed off their chests, director/screenwriter Peter Berg and lead actor Mark Wahlberg have once again joined forces to deliver Patriots Day, an unflinching dramatisation of the April 2013 Boston bombings, that has sparked some notoriety for being made so fairly soon after the tragedy happened. Whatever your thoughts on this, Berg has certainly done the victims justice in terms of portraying the raw human physical and emotional suffering that happened after the attacks, never allowing you to be entertained and just soberly reflect on what happened. Aside from this, how far it tows the line between Hollywood sensationalism and real life depiction is in constant flux.Not having gotten round to seeing Deepwater Horizon just yet, I'm unable to comment on Wahlberg's conviction as an oil rig worker, but he embodies the role of a Boston police officer perfectly, breezing through the part as a rough around the edges, self depreciating, foul mouthed blue collar guy, whose reactions to the events that unfold around him seem uncomfortably accurate. But in far more of a supporting role, it is Simmons who has the pivotal part, as the experienced, world weary sergeant whose exploits brought the killers down in real life. In the roles of the evil doers, Melikidize is impressively cold, joyless and drained as the domineering older brother of the two, complimented by Wolff as the eager protégé. In other supporting roles, Michelle Monaghan is Wahlberg's wife and a seriously slimmed down John Goodman works with Kevin Bacon as procedural FBI guys.Understandably for some, it may be too much, but it can't be accused of doing the victims a disservice, creating perfectly real human characters and dramatisation that cause you to reflect rather than enjoy yourself. ****",Patriots Day
22,MOscarbradley,I found this movie offensive.,3,17 January 2019,"One of the problems with a film like ""Patriot's Day"" is that the individual, personal stories of the victims and those caught up in the terrible events of the day in question mean very little to people outside of the United States, but more significantly should we even be making movies like this, films that deal with recent real-life tragedies where there is no historical perspective? The film may claim to honor the memory of the victims and yet ""Patriot's Day"" is filmed in such a way that it becomes simply a very well-made suspense movie with a strong sentimental streak running through it.There's no denying it's very well crafted but I also found it offensive; this isn't fiction like the disaster movies of the seventies. These people really lived and died and here is a movie that is being sold outside of America as if it were nothing more than a disaster flick, (and even in America I can't see people accepting it as anything other than that). It is certainly exciting and for that very reason, it also leaves a bad taste in the mouth. A good cast do what they can with a cliche-ridden script and I would hope it was made with the best of intentions but this is a movie that needed a much more documentary-like approach than the one it gets.",Patriots Day
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Teamwork triumphs over adversity in this relatively realistic and compelling tale.,7,18 May 2018,"'Patriot's Day (2017)' is a tad overlong and sometimes unfocused. It's usually engaging, though, and provides a fairly realistic look at a relatively recent terror-attack. It manages to shed some light on the events that occurred whilst also portraying a compelling account of teamwork triumphing over adversity. It does dip a little too deep into that 'Boston patriotism' that seems to come up every-time a film is set in that particular city, though this time it might actually be sort of worth it.

24,ThomasDrufke,Boston Strong,9,20 January 2017,"Peter Berg is on fire. After putting out Deepwater Horizon a few months back, he's back directing Mark Wahlberg in another film based on a true story. This time, a film based on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Easily one of the most emotionally powerful films of 2016.Patriots Day feels a lot like a documentary. Berg tackles the events leading up to and the aftermath of the attack with great detail. Because of the realism in which Berg displays the attacks, I found myself emotionally overwhelmed more than once within the first half an hour. We are shown a few dozen characters (almost all based on real- life people) across the entire city of Boston, and each of them feel important, unique, and most of all, real. Aside from Wahlberg's fictional character who occasionally gets involved a little too heavily in the search for the bombers, each character feels like a real human being that is experiencing these horrific events. To me, that is the most impressive feat Patriots Day accomplished.Whether it's a police sergeant buying his wife a muffin before heading to work, an MIT officer asking a girl out to a Zac Brown Band concert, or a young couple arguing about how to correctly pronounce certain words in the 'Boston way', this film was filled with real people. These nuances gave the audiences an easier 'in' to the story and characters than I could have imagined. Having a film focusing on this many people is an extremely difficult task, and Berg did a nice job encapsulating all sides of the story.With that said, I think all of the different angles catches up with the film after a while. I was always invested in the story, but I can see where audiences may think the movie wanders. I myself, appreciate how much this film covers, but the fact that it actually takes the time to focus on the bombers could turn some people off. I would have a hard time ever trying to understand the reasoning behind these attacks, but Berg did at least make the terrorists more than just someone with a trigger. You got to see their own real-life problems at home and with each other. Even though I can't help but think terrible thoughts when I see them on screen, I like that there is at least a small arc to them.Patriots Day has a lot going on, and even though it may appear to be counterproductive to show this many sides, it proved to be beneficial for me to see all these different sides to Boston. I felt like these actors weren't really acting, and instead were real people fighting to survive in a time where surviving was all that really mattered. Just as I said with Sully in 2016, Patriots Day is a tribute to how well we work as a species when we work together.

26,A_Different_Drummer,Writer/Director Peter Berg Takes Police Work to the next Level,9,13 January 2017,"PPs (police procedurals) are a staple of the film/TV industry and are (believe it or not) as common as comedies or romcoms. However, within that category, ""big"" PPs based on big crimes are not that common. In fact, you would have to go back to the early 70s when a number of ""big PPs"" like Day of the Jackal 1973 were all the rage.So, a film like this done properly (and, trust me, this one is done perfectly) would be a treat all by itself. However, what makes this film extra-special is the extensive use of video footage.Now, to be clear, video footage as a plot device is not new by itself. It is now, and has been used extensively in British film and TV because, as we all know, London is the most ""surveyed"" city on the planet.But -- the point -- nothing the Brits have ever done with the forensic use of video comes even close to what Berg brings us in this excellent film. Much the same way that the original creators of CSI-Vegas introduced an entirely new sort of sub-genre, it can be argued that Patriots Day similarly has taken the police procedural to an entirely new level.The film itself? Brilliant! Berg has taken a stellar group of A-listers and make them work as a team, mirroring on the subliminal level the theme of the movie, which is both positive, and hopeful, and suggests that if we all work together, we can accomplish pretty much anything.",Patriots Day

30,ironhorse_iv,"While, it was good movie, Patriot Day was a marathon of emotions to get through.",8,21 January 2017,"Maybe, it's just me, but I thought this movie was a little too soon to make. After all, as of this writing, the tragic events of the 2013's Boston Marathon Bombing was only 3 years ago. Because of this, the wounds are far from healed. Don't get me wrong, I know the filmmakers, including director Peter Berg, reportedly took great pains to get the blessing of the Boston community and survivors of the attack in the making of the film. Yet, I really don't like the idea of Hollywood profiting off a tragedy, unless they intend to give the money to charities. Sadly, I don't think, that is the case. As of this writing, there is little prove that the producers has donate any money, made off from this film to the One Fund Boston. I guess, audience members like myself are to blame. After all, we're the ones, paying to see, big time studios reenactments tragic events of real-life people dying on the big screen, knowing full well, that they capitalize on real-people's deaths. I take full responsibility for having a morbid curiosity. It really hard to say 'no'. Movies like this, has always invokes an accompanying social catharsis with people. Some see these types of movies to get reflective and feel grateful for how lucky, their lives are better than those of the characters on screen. Others, go see movies like this, to feel pity and empathy for those who lose their lives, wanting to share in the pain of a tragic event. Yet, for others like myself, went to see this film, wanting to compare the reel-life account to real-life history. Without spoiling the movie based off, 'Boston Strong' by Casey Sherman & Dave Wedge, too much, the film does depicted the bombing and the aftermath, very well. It's visceral and terrifying as you'd expect with Berg mixing gory and gruesome fictional dramatized footage with real-life video footage from the actual event. However, there were a few big jarring moments that were a little too noticeable. A good example is how the film portray the brothers bombers, Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) and Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) staying with each other in Tamerlan's house, after the bombing, when in truth, one of them, Dzhokhar return to university that he was staying and remained there until the FBI released pictures of them at the marathon. Another is how they handle officer, Sean Collier (Jake Picking). Not only did they portray him, as having a relationship with a fictional MIT student, despite in real-life, having a girlfriend, but they also stress that he was just patrolling the school, only to be surprise by the brothers, for reasons, like just wanting a second gun. In truth, Collier was responding to a report of a disturbance of two men, sneaking into the school, when he was ambush. As you see, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was an attended attack for the brothers, as the terrorists hope to use the school for mass-murder, similar to 2004's Beslan school siege. However, since the brothers were unable to gain access into the school, without being notice. They abandoned their plans for something else. Another thing that bug me about this film is how they paint law enforcement, a little too infallible due to cathartic duties of appealing to the conservative target audience. Not a lot of them, question, the civil liberties that they were tramping on for the greater good. I wish, the film was more interested in questioning those, as it could have been a much richer experience. Because of this, the film does feel a bit manipulative and one-sided. A good example of this, is the scene where Tamerlan's American wife Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist) is portray as an evil Muslim villain, when in truth, information is still pending, whether Russell had a hand to play or not. There was no good reason, why she wasn't being read her Miranda rights. Another big deviation from true events is the presence of fictional police officer, Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg). While, there is nothing wrong with having a composite character, in the movie. I really don't like, how he is the main driving force for the narrative. The idea, that his super cop character was everywhere and gave ideas on, where the bombers were, was a bit highly unrealistic and felt a bit glamorized. Because of this, I felt like the movie gave little to no credit to the many of the unnamed police officers that put themselves on the line to defend Boston during those importance days. A good example is how Police Officer Dennis 'DJ' Simmonds is not mention in the movie. He gave his life in order to bring the bombers to justice. Plus, the movie doesn't give any credit to victims like Jeff Bauman, who gave a detailed description of the bomber which enabled the photo to be identified and circulated quickly by the FBI. If anything, these people deserve more credit than Wahlberg's fictional character. Still, if you can look past that, Wahlberg does do a great job, showing a range of emotions. His sobbing exposition to his fictional wife, Carol (Michelle Monaghan) was one of the best moments in the film. Still, Wahlberg should had known better, than to, overshadow the other performers in the film. Because of this, I really didn't get the sense, that anybody else, was amazing in the film. It's sad, because rest of the ensemble is mostly based on real people. They were just meh. Even the music from composers, Trent Reznor and Attitcus Ross felt like a letdown. In the end, while, this is the third real-life historical movie collaboration between Wahlberg and Berg since 2013's 'Lone Survivor' and 2016's 'Deepwater Horizon'. I felt that, it is the weakest of the three. It was just watchable. Perhaps, I just like the documentary-style approach to this material toward the end credit better. I can only hope, similar film, 2017's 'Stronger', could be better.",Patriots Day

I mean all I knew was the marathon bombing, but I came to know that was only half, the other half was even more serious events that stretched for like a week after the original event.The best part of the film was, there were no solo heroes in this story. Everybody contributed in some way to fight against the evil. The screenplay was shared by all the great actors, even small role ones equally. I loved how it all went on, as a team from different forces, but tackled the situation by joining the hands. I don't know it was only the film, but very impressive.

And then they all end up in the same place where a series of explosion goes up. Quickly the security agencies come together and investigate it. With a small clue, kicks starts the manhunt. This is the part I loved it. Hunting pisslam pigs are always so pleasure to watch.Suspense, thriller, the story was well paced and took forward with a wonderful ending. Awesome direction. Another hit in a single year alongside 'Deepwater Horizon'. Interesting, Wahlberg involved in both these films. I've also heard that the two screenplays was merged to make a single film.

34,tomgillespie2002,A solid piece of storytelling,7,18 April 2017,"Teaming up once again with actor Mark Wahlberg to tell a true-life tale of American heroism in the face of disaster and tragedy, director Peter Berg tackles the very recent Boston marathon bombings, which occurred just four years ago in 2013, with Patriots Day. Starting with 2013's Lone Survivor, which followed a close unit as they are surrounded by a hostile Afghan enemy, and continuing with Deepwater Horizon last year, which followed the events that led to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Berg has saved the best of his trilogy until last. The second of two films he released in 2016, one would expect Patriots Day to be hastily put together, but is in fact Berg's most accomplished and well- crafted movies to date.Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg) is a Boston police sergeant facing a slap on the wrist by his superiors for a bust-up with one of his fellow officers. Already carrying a swollen knee, he feels humiliated for having to don the police uniforms and carry out routine police duty at the finishing line of the Boston marathon. The day is all going to plan and the spectators are having fun taking part, until two bombs detonated by terrorists Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) and his younger, more Americanised brother Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff), send the city into panic and action. The film follows the events immediately before and after the attack, switching between various characters who will eventually be caught up in the aftermath. There's a young, attractive couple at the starting line as the explosions hit; Chinese student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang) who has his car jacked by the brothers; and a police sergeant of nearby city Watertown, Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons).Although there will be those watching who followed the events closely as they unravelled through the media back in 2013, Berg is meticulous with detail, seemingly following every decision made as the cops and FBI try to figure out who was behind the attacks, and having the actors eerily reenact the surveillance footage that was released to the public during the manhunt. There is a workmanship quality about it, with Berg opting for a matter-of-fact dramatisation of the events rather than sensationalising them. Some of the best scenes have seasoned actors verbally spar with each other, with the FBI initially hesitant to label the bombing an act of terrorism and later to release photographs of the suspects to the media. These moments are brought to life by a slimmed-down John Goodman as Boston Commissioner Ed Davis and Kevin Bacon as Special Agent Richard DesLauriers.Like the Berg/Wahlberg movies that came before, Patriots Day is clearly well-intended. But while Lone Survivor took place in 2005 and Deepwater Horizon in 2010, the dust has barely settled in Boston. and the attack must still linger in the mind of those who witnessed it. It would be justified to label the film as too soon, but Berg makes a point of highlighting the spirit of Boston as a whole. While this leads to some of the film's cheesiest dialogue, Patriots Day feels like a raised fist of defiance rather than a potentially insensitive cash-in of a very recent tragedy, interviewing some of the characters' real-life counterparts at the very end. It is also incredibly good at building tension, depicting the everyday actions of those who will later cross paths with the fugitives before exploding into an action-packed finale. Berg is more than capable of staging an accomplished set-piece, and he is successful in delivering a realistic and riveting climax, rounding off a solid piece of storytelling that is respectful of all the Bostonians who came together in 2013 for the city they love.",Patriots Day
35,Thanos_Alfie,The aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing...,7,16 March 2020,"""Patriots Day"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we follow the story of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath of it. We watch the manhunt of the terrorists behind this bombing and how the whole city helped the police to find the terrorists.I really liked this movie because it was based on a real-life event and it showed us what exactly happened that day and also the aftermath of it. This movie reminded me the movie of 2017 ""Stronger"" with Jake Gyllenhaal which also presented the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing but from a different perspective. The direction which was made by Peter Berg who is also one of the writers of this movie, was very good and it was obvious that he made a very good research about this event, with many interviews of the people who survived from it but also with the police officers and every person that was involved in this manhunt. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I believe that Mark Wahlberg who played as Tommy Saunders, John Goodman who played as Commissioner Ed Davis, J.K. Simmons who played as Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese and Kevin Bacon who played as Special Agent Richard DesLauriers were all amazing. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is a very good way of learning what exactly happened on the 2013 Boston Marathon from the inside and I also recommend you to watch the movie of 2017 ""Stronger"" with Jake Gyllenhaal.",Patriots Day
36,cruise01,Patriots is an effective thriller showing the crisis of the Boston Marathon tragedy,9,17 January 2017,"Patriots Day a drama thriller based on the Boston Marathon bombing pays a great tribute to the lives that were taken and the officers that put their lives on the line to protect us against evil. It is a remarkable film that shows Boston's finest and how every one will stick together to fight against America's tragedy on April of 2013. Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg team up for the third time and also on a film that is also based on real events. They did great with their previous films like Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon. Berg direction is remarkable and close to these people that went through these dark times. The horrible tragedy took away a few innocent lives and left many injured and amputated from the Boston Marathon event. The plot focuses on Boston officer Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) and his perspective on most of the tragic event. Also, several characters that the film followed from the survivors and victims like a young couple that were there at the marathon. Also, a young college stationed officer, and a young kid Dun Meng, who was carjacked by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The film has a few side stories with introducing us to these people but how they were involved and the direction is done so well. That we feel for these people and how they were all affected by this event. It is an emotionally powerful film seeing these officers in this manhunt and trying to protect their city from this terror. Berg does well in building the suspense and tension in the beginning of the film. Seeing Officer Tommy starting his day, trying to win his reputation back from being suspended. Then, we are introduced to FBI Richard (Kevin Bacon), who leads the team into a manhunt for the Tsarnaev brothers. From following up with surveillance profiling to asking for the public to help with any recording devices they have used during the marathon. The film does have an intense feel, as Berg does not get carried away with Hollywood big action set up. But more of a grounded shoot out sequence, that brings a lot of chaos onto the screen when the officers are on the brothers trail. And involved in a neighborhood shoot out. With the recognized officers or those involved. These people you are emotionally affected by when they are facing danger. They all deserve the recognition for their bravery. The film music composer Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is also stunning that works well with the tone they are trying to make with the movie. The script works well with making these characters believable and making it a tough movie to watch. Patriots Day is an emotionally powerful film that shows Berg's direction being at its finest and Mark Wahlberg delivering a strong performance. The ending showing the real people involved and interviews with the survivors is a tough one to see. I definitely recommend.",Patriots Day
37,Floated2,Good depiction based on true events,8,9 October 2017,"Based on tragic events in which were not too long ago after this film's release, Patriot's Day shows more inside of the events as it shows how things leading up to the bombing happened. This film is more gritty and intriguing with a lot more cursing than what was expected. They went with a hard R rating which may have caused the film to perform weaker than expected had they went with the typical PG-13 rating. Though, a film like this, they do not hold back on the language.Featuring strong performances from its leads as well as the supporting cast, Patriots Day delivers in what it's supposed to do. A better and more interesting film than expected, highly recommend if wanted more insight on the tragic bombing events. As a rewatch 06/16/20' Patriots Day is better on another watch. Truly a gripping and thought provoking film.",Patriots Day
38,eddie_baggins,Another solid but unremarkable Berg film,6,8 February 2017,"Ever since his cracking 2004 debut in the form of Friday Night Lights actor turned director Peter Berg has found himself becoming the new master of delivering solid if unremarkable thrillers.Each varying in success, after 2004 has passed Berg has put his name to the likes of The Kingdom, Hancock, Lone Survivor, Battleship and last year's surprisingly effective Deepwater Horizon and seemingly unable to withhold from the lure of working Sir Mark Wahlberg (who is rather dry in his role here) once again, we now have Patriot's Day which was released mere months after Deepwater Horizon in what seems like a hope the patriotic film had a chance to compete at this year's awards circuit.That Patriots Day failed to score much traction during the awards season is not surprising and that it failed to capture the American public's interest in regards to box office takings also isn't curious upon examination as this solid but instantly forgettable film about an horrific true life event that is anything but does lack a certain magic that would've made it a far more emotionally engaging experience.Moving at a cracking pace and covering lots of various true to life characters that we barely get to know, Patriots Day does a great job at placing the audience into the day that changed the city of Boston forever but it never truly captures our hearts despite Berg's attempt to draw out easy emotional wins throughout the film whether it be Wahlberg's police officer Tommy Saunders attempts at emotionally charged speeches or scenes of kindly police officers minding the bodies of the deceased.What Patriots Day does well though is offers fantastic insights to what occurred in the aftermath of these horrific terrorist acts as we are drawn into the investigation and therefore sucked into the tension that not only gripped the city but the world as those that were responsible for the acts of unprovoked violence walked free amongst the everyday civilians that were living their lives in a constant state of fear and terror. Berg gives Patriots Day an almost documentary like vibe and from the moment the bombs erupt, Patriots Day barely stops to take a breath as the next 4 – 5 days play out before our eyes.Filled with fine supporting turns by an underused A-list cast that includes John Goodman, Kevin Bacon and J.K Simmons, Patriots Day is pro-Americana mixed with an insightful retelling of a moment in time that will always be remembered. Berg might not be hitting high marks, but this is another worthwhile film from the director that is worth your time, even if it's unlikely to be one that sticks with you after the credits have rolled.3 blueberry muffins out of 5",Patriots Day
39,leonblackwood,Impressive portrayal of the horrific events that happened in Boston! 7/10,7,27 August 2017,"Review: I really enjoyed this intense, and emotional movie, which explains in depth, what actually happened during the Boston Marathon bombing. All of the characters are based on real people, which you see at the end, and the director added real footage, which make the film realistic and pretty shocking. Mark Wahlberg plays Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders, who is policing near the finishing line, when the bombs explode. At the beginning of the movie, it follows Tommy's life, as a loving husband, with a painful knee injury but once the bombs explode, the movie is focused on how the whole of Boston pulled together to catch the terrorist. With the governor putting pressure on the FBI, headed by Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), they quickly manage to track down the 2 bombers, who are forced to leave Boston, with the police force heavily on there tail. After a massive shoot-out, one of the terrorist manage to escape, which leads to another man hunt. The governor decides to shut-down a part of Boston, so they can catch the remaining terrorist, and it takes a stroke of luck for them to come face to face with the enemy. It is definitely an emotional story, which touched many people's heart and I liked the way that the director showed everyone's back story, before the tragic event happened. I personally wouldn't have put Mark Wahlberg's character in the lead, mainly because it was a joint achievement and there were other people that made a bigger contribution to solving the case but every movie needs a hero. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, especially the shoot-out, and it's full of intensity and drama. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although this movie didn't smash the box office, for some unknown reason, director Peter Berg, 53, portrayed the true story very well, and he stayed true to the events that happened on Marathon Day. His previous projects include Very Bad Things, Welcome to the Jungle, Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom, Hancock, Battleship, Lone Survivor, and Deepwater Horizon. He certainly has a diverse filmography, which is pretty impressive, so he was a perfect choice to bring such a pinnacle moment in American history, to the big screen. On the down side, Mark Wahlberg could have brought some more emotion to the project and I would have liked to have seen some of the big stars a bit more but apart from that, I was quite impressed.Budget: $45million Worldwide Gross: $50.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their history/crime/dramas, starring Mark Wahlberg, Michelle Monaghan, John Goodman, Christopher O'Shea, J.K. Simmons and Michael Beach. 7/10",Patriots Day
40,TheMovieDiorama,Patriots Day encapsulates human resilience of a true disaster whilst providing sincere entertainment.,8,22 June 2018,"Depicting real life events and portraying them for the purpose of entertainment can feel exploitative. Utilising the innocence and helplessness of lives within a tragedy could be illustrated in a way that feels excessively melodramatic. Whilst this film does occasionally suffer from exploitation, overall it's an incredibly powerful window that openly views the sheer bravery and determination of an entire city. A dramatisation of the 2013 Boston marathon bombings where policing individuals are tasked with hunting down the terrorists. Berg and Wahlberg continue their trend of interpreting recent events in a motion picture, with this entry easily being their most formidably challenging depiction. Berg seamlessly balances humanistic melancholy that evokes powerful emotions with thrillingly realistic action sequences to create an involving film. Boston becomes this microcosm for America. A city's resilience is translated across the sprawling country. It's not just specific individuals hunting down the culprits, it's a nation tackling the ever growing issue or terrorism. Radicalisation that is endangering the lives of many. Berg captures the essence of Boston, a tough hearty city, and powers it through his direction. His technical assurance elevates the confidence of what the film is attempting to dramatise. It is moving. It is powerful. It is relentless. His consistent use of combining real footage, particularly the film's ending, with Wahlberg's solid performance only enhances the gritty realism of the pressurised hours after the event. I appreciate the moment of reflection from the survivors, however it does come across as emotionally manipulative thus detracting from the nuanced tone. The surprise really comes from the ""plot"", where the attention is primarily focused on detailing the police and investigative work that preceded the explosions. The immediate pressure from governmental entities and media presence heightens the tension rapidly and instantly draws you in. Impressively patriotic and unexplotative.",Patriots Day
41,matthewssilverhammer,Your Dad's New Favorite Movie,6,20 January 2017,"Patriots Day recounts the horrifying bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon with great care for the details: the chaotic confusion, the shocking violence, the individual personhood of those affected, even the necessary moments of levity. On the other hand, it's also very Hollywood: the passionate speeches about terrorism, the well-meaning proselytizing about down-home patriotism, even a potentially dangerous representation of Muslims. With a message about communal-love-overcoming-hate that's never fully realized, its thematically desperate American milquetoast. However, it's well-made thematically desperate American milquetoast, and sometimes that's good enough. Director Berg (last year's fantastic Deepwater Horizon) is an undeniably talented stylist. His cinema verite camera fits his modern historical dramas well, especially here, when seamlessly mixed with the staggering documentary footage. The R-rating gives him the necessary space to allow the effective action and authentic language to carry the intended naturalism. Unfortunately, for all the reality in the engaging and human thrills (especially during the manhunt), we're bombarded with some super lame dialogue full of exposition & preachifying, leaving us feeling talked at instead of engaged with. This dramatic opportunism can often be the inherent difficulty with dramatizing such recent, well-known history. We bring our own fresh memories, political leanings, and personal feelings to each moment, making our criticism more vehement. To Berg's credit, he mostly sidesteps the bigger problems of this sub-genre by focusing on multiple specific characters directly affected by the tragedy. So while its aims to reach wide left the film feeling shallow, Patriots Day's procedural suspense & refreshing flow of the story make this a movie worth taking your dad to.",Patriots Day
42,paul-allaer,"""When the devil hits you, the only way to fight back is love"" ... Intense look at the Boston Marathon bombings",8,14 January 2017,"""Patriots Day"" (2016 release; 133 min.) brings the story of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and its aftermath. As the movie opens, we see Boston PD Sergeant Tommy Saunders and 2 of his colleagues make a house visit. We then move around swiftly: 10:16 PM the Kensky residence, 11:38 PM Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 12:55 AM the Saunders residence. Now it's only hours to go before Saunders, bum knee and all, need to report for duty at the Boston Marathon finishing line. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second consecutive collaboration between writer-director Peter Berg and actor producer Mark Wahlberg, only months after the excellent ""Deepwater Horizon"" (and third overall, with ""Lone Survivor"" a few years ago). Here they retell what happened in the hours leading up to the Boston Marathon, the devastation brought by the bombings, and the subsequent search for the killers/terrorists. The bombings take place about 25 min. into the movie. Even though we get a thumbnail introduction to various people, including some of the victims and of course also the killers, it is not enough to establish an emotional bond for the viewer (that bond will come much later in the movie). The cat-and-mouse manhunt for the killers is for me the better part of the movie, we truly want those cowards to be caught and held accountable. Couple of cautions: the movie does NOT look at all as to how the killers evolved into what they became. Also, much of the movie is filmed with hand-held cameras, giving the movie an even more ""24""-like feel to it, with all due respect to Wahlberg, John Goodman, J.K. Simmons and the rest of the cast, they are secondary to the overall feel of the movie, which is bigger than the single parts of the movie. I should point out that the character played by Wahlberg is fictional, something that apparently has irked the Boston media and critics quite heavily. Last but not least, there is an excellent electronic score, composed by NIN's Trent Reznor and by Atticus Ross.""Patriots Day"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended (but not sold out). Even with a fictional character in the movie, I felt the movie was very intense and very respectful (check in particular the last 10 min. of the movie...), so I don't understand why the Boston critics are so negative about this movie. At the end of the screening today, the audience erupted into applause (the second weekend in a row, last weekend it was for ""Hidden Figures""). If you have an interest into seeing for yourself what happened at the 2013 Boston Marathon and its aftermath (even though we never get an explanation as to what motivated the killers), ""Patriots Day"" is worth seeking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Patriots Day
43,subxerogravity,I was very impressed by what I saw.,7,23 December 2016,"Was never fully sure about the movie. Very iffy only because I find it weird how so many movies about real life stories are about relatively recent events. The marathon bomber happen three years ago, that seems like such little time to make a narrative about history.Despite this, it was a great police drama. It showed law enforcement coming together for the greater good and it was a beautiful image to see, cause in most police dramas, cops even have discrimination upon themselves. If this was fiction, Boston PD would not be able to get along with Water Town PD and both would hate the FBI cause for some reason the tension of trying to find terrorist is not enough for writers. It was good to see cops be 100% at their job. They were not portrayed as being perfect only as being human and heroes are human. They were regular Boston citizens who wear a badge.It was a very good story about people coming together to step up to the challenge. I expect noting less from director Peter Berg who has a real skill when it comes to bringing out every heroic moment.",Patriots Day
44,jtindahouse,Beautifully handled and a hell of a watch,9,8 March 2017,"Movies based around the September 11th terrorist attacks have always been met with much controversy. A lot of people think using the film to aide your story, such as a film like 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' did in 2011, is out of line and unnecessary. Then there are the films like 'United 93' which were based around the actual happenings of that fateful day. Those too managed to draw controversy, but I don't really see why. The fact is these events happened. As awful as they are, people have the right to see the stories brought to life. If they are too sensitive to you, don't watch them. Very simple. 'Patriot's Day' follows the story of the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013. They weren't quite on the scale of 9/11 obviously, but they were still a pretty big deal felt around the globe. I thought writer/director Peter Berg did a fantastic job in telling the story of the event and the days that followed. He found a way to make sure every character was included in what felt like an equal way. Even having a star on board like Mark Wahlberg never detracted from the other characters. That, mixed with the splicing of real footage in the appropriate moments, all made for a very well made film.It's also a brilliantly paced film. The 133 minute run time absolutely flies by. I had worried a bit going in that there would be a lot of filler, but that certainly wasn't the case. Not a minute in this film is put to waste. It can be a tough watch it must be said. There are some pretty serious scenes that are a little grizzly to watch. Even if you need to wait a few more years though and let the sensitivity die down, make sure you see this film at some point. It's one not to be missed.",Patriots Day
45,Turfseer,Fitting tribute to Boston Marathon victims as well as gripping action-thriller,8,30 July 2017,"A nice mixture of fiction and fact, Patriots Day is Peter Berg's chronicle of the terrorist attack on the 2013 Boston Marathon and its aftermath. Mark Wahlberg stars as Boston Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders, a composite character based on various real people in law enforcement who were involved in the aid to the survivors of the bombing and subsequent investigation.Patriots Day starts off rather slowly, mapping out where the principal characters were before the evil brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev commenced their dirty work. The Tsarnaevs are also profiled in the pre-bombing snapshot, as we're introduced to them as ordinary looking folk along with Tamerlan's Muslim-American wife, who figures prominently later in the narrative, when she's grilled by a team of crack investigators who specialize in interviewing terror suspects.Once the bombings occur, the action is non-stop and best described as riveting. Of course the injuries to the victims probably don't appear as horrific as they were for those who observed them in real life, but Berg manages to intersperse actual footage from the scene that results in a fairly convincing verisimilitude.A fascinating piece of the narrative is the behind-the-scenes investigation into the bombings, with FBI agent Richard DesLauriers (played by a highly effective Kevin Bacon) facing pressure from others when he initially declines to release information on the suspects.One fact I wasn't aware of was that the Tsarnaev brothers took a Chinese student, Dun Meng, hostage, after carjacking his vehicle. Perhaps one of the most exciting scenes in the film is when Meng escapes his captors and then becomes a certifiable hero by recalling his GPS coordinates, which assists law enforcement in locating the Tsarnaevs.As it transpired, the Tsarnaevs ended up in Watertown, a suburb of Boston, where the confrontation with the local police went down. J. K. Simmons bears a striking resemblance to the real Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who actually tackled Tamerlan, and narrowly avoided death himself when Dzhokhar escaped, but not before running over his brother in a car.The massive manhunt for Dzhokhar is ably chronicled, but one wonders how Saunders keeps popping up all over the place (especially in the middle of Waterown), since he's supposed to be a Boston beat cop (of course this is a matter of dramatic license, as Saunders is a composite character who is supposed to tie everything together).Wahlberg does well portraying the edgy Saunders who can't hide the fact that he has a chip on his shoulder. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent including a slimmed-down John Goodman as the Boston police commissioner.Patriots Day not only is an excellent action-thriller but manages to provide a fitting tribute to the victims of the carnage inflicted by the terrorists. It should definitely be on your must-see list for the films released in the last year.",Patriots Day
46,stevendbeard,Emotional & Inspiring,7,14 January 2017,"I saw ""Patriot's Day"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Daddy's Home, Contraband; John Goodman-The Monuments Men, Speed Racer; Michelle Monaghan-The Mission:Impossible movies, Boston Public_tv; Kevin Bacon-Black Mass, Frost/Nixon and J.K. Simmons-Contraband, True Grit_2010.This movie is based on a true story about terrorists setting off bombs at the Boston Marathon in April of 2013 which killed 3 and injured 264. It's directed by Peter Berg, who also directed Deepwater Horizon and Lone Survivor-I guess he likes directing true stories. Mark is a cop that helps track down the terrorists and Michelle is his wife. John is the police commissioner, J.K. is a police sergeant that gets involved in a nasty shootout with the terrorists and Kevin is an F.B.I. agent running the investigation. I liked the way the film would show different groups of people early in the film and they are later shown having a more memorable connection. At first, I was wondering what a young married couple, an MIT campus policeman and a Chinese entrepreneur would have to do with the story but they do have a purpose. They also show a little bit into the lives of the terrorist leading up to the tragedy. Oh yeah, there is a cameo of Melissa Benoist-aka Supergirl on TV-as a terrorist' wife. They also cover the incident during the city wide manhunt when one of the terrorists hides in someone's boat-I remember watching the real deal on TV when it happened. The scenes of the aftermath of the bombings is horrific and emotional but when the first responders do their thing, and the regular Bostonians help out, it is very inspiring. Tragedy seems to bring out the best in people. At the end of the movie, the real people are shown and they talk about their experiences. It's rated ""R"" for violence, graphic injury images, language and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. It was a moving experience and I would buy it on DVD.",Patriots Day
47,meeza,On track as one of the best of 2016!,10,13 July 2017,"I am going to run this by you from the start, Director Peter Berg has masterminded an excellent procedural film in ""Patriots Day""; which is not based on dates that the New England Patriots have won Super Bowls in the last 20 years. Seriously, it is based on the bombing that occurred in the Boston Marathon in 2013 which suffered some fatalities and many injuries. We all do know the happenings from that day and after, but Berg executes the direction of ""Patriots Day"" in such a multi-layered precise fashion that makes viewers be infused within the tragedies & triumphs of this unforgettable occurrence. Berg favorite Mark Wahlberg stars as Boston PD Sergeant Tommy Saunders; why wasn't he a Colonel? Sorry, my mind is a bit Kentucky Pun Fried. Anyways, Wahlber's Saunders is a representation of a Boston Police official who was both involved in the marathon bombing and the capture of one of the suspects. Berg alongside co-writers Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer developed a multifaceted screenplay that incorporates many figures and happenings which occurred before and during the bombing; and also the days following during the hunt of the brother suspects. The film is not an actor's showcase it is more Berg's run; but we do get admirable performances from Wahlberg, John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, and J.K. Simmons; also notable were the performances from Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze who play the terrorist brothers Dzohkhar and Tamerian Tsarnaev. I have to consider myself a cinematic patriot by lining up ""Patriots Day"" as one of the most gripping films of 2016. ***** Excellent",Patriots Day
48,st-shot,Sarge saves the day.,6,31 January 2017,"Based on the terrorist bomb attack and subsequent manhunt for the perpetrators Patriots Day is a gripping enough thriller in spite of knowing it's outcome. With its brief period from act to capture director Peter Berg keeps things moving as he crosscuts between the major players in the incident before during and after offering up enough background to give characters enough depth for the audience to invest in. The film also meshes actual surveillance footage to the narrative in a near seamless way as they close in on the culprits in a massive effort by law enforcement not always on the same page. In the face of this collective contribution director Berg decides to focus on Sgt. Frank Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) a Boston cop dealing with a bad knee and an attitude problem that has not helped his career advancement. As the governor, Feds and local cops squabble it is left up to Saunders on a couple of occasions to set them straight before driving around in other jurisdictions hot on the bombers trail. It makes him look like the only cop in Boston at times tracking them. Berg deciding to focus on Wahlberg ( he's also the producer) instead of a relay between other key players to tell this gripping story ultimately dilutes the suspense by concentrating on Sarge and ignoring other contributors to a well done team effort.",Patriots Day
49,alindsay-al,A great emotional film,8,27 February 2017,"I have heard really good things about this film so I was very excited to see patriots day and I have now seen and I think this film is great. The premise of the film is based on the true story of the bombing of the 2013 Boston marathon and the hunt for the people that caused it. Mark wahlberg plays the lead cop in this film and he was brilliant in this film, you could tell he is really passionate about this project. He gives a truly powerful emotional performance that sells you on his character. John Goodman plays the police commissioner and he also does a great job, you can feel the emotion coming from him and also just how important catching these terrorists is to him and the people of Boston. Kevin bacon plays the FBI agent put in charge of the investigation and this is the best he has been in a few years really as he is great in his role. You can see him try to take emotion out of his investigation which is a really interesting character especially his conflict with Goodman. Michelle Monaghan, jk Simmons and Melissa Benoit have smaller roles in this film but I thought they all did a really good job in this film in there performances. The story of the film is truly gut punching when this event happens in all the right ways, also the investigation about it is incredibly interesting to watch and you support them completely. However, there are some subplots in this film especially in the first 30 mins of this film that I didn't really care about. Yes I know they come into play later in the film I just feel like they could have been handled better. The script has some obvious great dramatic dialogue when it comes to trying the manhunt and it is all really believable. There is also a nice bit of humour from some of the characters that is also believable. The style of the film has obviously a lot of dramatic moments and also some good action scenes. However, the pacing of this film is not great, it bounces between a few to many story arcs in the film and sometimes especially towards the middle of the film where the film does drag. Overall this is a great respectful film that if you are interested in the event it is a must watch.",Patriots Day

Wahlberg plays a man that was real & there & never rested until the evil was brought to justice, he's Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders a real life true hero & Wahlberg nails the part with full conviction & truth.
Other true life roles are filled out with Kevin Bacon & John Goodman among others & all put in real gritty performances but it's definitely Wahlberg who owns the movie & is so watchable.

It's just such an honest and brilliant dedication. In the movie Mark Wahlberg states that terrorism can't win because people will fight it with love, or words to that effect. Very true Mark, but may I sincerely add that terrorists won't win because Hollywood will fight them with powerful movies such as Patriots Day. I thought the casting was really clever.

54,Samiam3,Admirable but Unpolished,6,4 June 2017,"Like Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day is a well cast, well intentioned docudrama that doesn't have enough to offer beyond facts. This one has a bit more of a shape than Deepwater. There is a distinctive first, second and third act, but each one has a different set of problemsIn act one, Berg gives us a handful of rushed character introductions leading into the Boston Marathon and the bombing. Berg handles these scenes rather poorly. Choppy editing and hectic camera work, draw too much attention to the chaos and fail to highlight what the images (some of them rather bloody) have to say. Act two depicts the man hunt for the bombers, intercut with the bombers on the run. Kevin Bacon, with his bureaucratic poker face and stiff upper lip is facially well cast as the head of the investigation. Most of these scene take place at night, under unnaturally dim street light. Segments depicting the bombers taking of a hostage coupled with the interrogation of one bomber's wife are the highlight scenes of the movie. It took me a moment to figure out why and I think it is simply the intimacy and insight. One of the bombers asks the hostage calmly if he is aware that 9/11 was faked. How do you respond in that situation? The investigation climaxes with a big fire fight on an otherwise quiet suburban street. Berg's set up would have lent itself well to a long take (field camera) style of shooting but he again opts to be more choppy and claustrophobic in a way that is very disorienting.The final act of the movie hammers home themes of unity and community strength that feel hokey with an uncomfortably celebratory tone. Catching the bad guys doesn't automatically make a happy ending. Are we supposed to forget that great damage has been done and lives have been affected. Berg's manipulative tone is incompatible with the otherwise realistic movie that he has made.The best praise I can give Patriot's Day is that it is a good treatment of a Wikipedia article.",Patriots Day

56,rgkarim,Patriotic Pride Rings Throughout The Movie,8,14 January 2017,"Mark Wahlberg and disaster movies seem to go hand and hand these days and this weekend brings the latest installment in his library. Today I got to see Patriots Day, a movie that dramatizes the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013. Like all disaster movies, it holds the promise for inspiring the audience or stirring up emotion. But has Hollywood hit its saturation point? Hi Robbie K here, with a new abbreviated review of Patriots Day. Let's get startedLIKES:  Very Detailed  Good visual/audio techniques  Emotionally strong movieSummary: When it comes to historical movies we like details and Patriots Day does not fall short in portraying this tragic event. From the bombings to the manhunt, you get to see the thrilling, and sometimes chilling, journey to bring the case to a close. The movie shows the events from the perspectives of many involved including victims, cops, and the terrorists themselves. An even more impressive twist is the smooth integration of real life security clips that helps keep the facts in check, while also showing the inspiration of the movie. When you take these clips, and mix them with the movie magic of scene and music editing, you get incredibly powerful scenes that are certain to inspire you. I agree with the trailers that Patriots Day is one of the most emotional stirring pieces to grace the silver screen this year. So many sequences promote the concepts of uniting in the face of danger, perseverance of spirit, and American pride. It had many in my viewing sniffling and certainly got some goosebumps going in this reviewer. Therefore, Patriots Day editing is certainly the selling point of this movie.DISLIKES  Movie magic overdramatizes  Some editing issues  May poke some snakesSummary: As seen many times in Hollywood, the magic of the cinema sometimes steps into overdramatic role. Patriots Day, despite how emotionally stirring it is, does cross into preachy side at times. While it certainly is inspiring, much of the ending moments (primarily the dialogue) is geared towards American pride that may be seen as boastful. In addition, some people may not appreciate the portrayal of the various characters, perhaps thinking they were too extreme in their renditions. Yes, some of the audience said this during the movie. But outside of overdramatic moments and extreme portrayals, the only other component for me was some of the editing lapses in the movie. There are certain scenes that attempt to show some of the background info on the characters (e.g. dating, guys getting high on weed, etc) which were certainly entertaining or aggravating. However, these moments were either not timed right, or more often not needed for me to get the emotional kick of the movie. And to be honest, most of these clips do extend the cast's screen time. The Verdict: Patriots Day is a movie that will bring some sort of emotion to most audience members. The detail is fantastic and makes you feel a part of the team in this epic manhunt, establishing that rage to capture the bad guys. The special effects and audio score will only deepen your immersion into the story. However, be ready for some political discussions and potential airing of grievances when you see the very extreme portrayals in this movie. Overall though, this movie is a solid opening to the year and a welcome break up from the mundane. My scores:Drama/History/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",Patriots Day
57,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Patriots Day,8,16 January 2017,"Just recently, I posted my top ten movie picks for 2016. I don't plan on augmenting them but if I did, Mark Wahlberg's latest would defiantly make the top five. So OK, I will now give you my observations for Patriots Day, one of this year's best.""Day"" is directed by Peter Berg. He has done everything from sports dramas to black comedies to hero-ed tributes. Patriots Day is by far his best work. It's the culmination of his ever changing career as a filmmaker. You want a story told based on actual events? Go with Berg and ""Day"". You want interviews from denizens who lived through said events? Peter Berg is the man. You want cinema that's militarily overwrought? Peter Berg for mayor. Finally, do you want the notion of harmless, unsteady camera-work included? Peter Berg is all over it. Remember when I said that I hoped Patriots Day would fill the void left by Berg's disappointing, Deepwater Horizon? Trust me, it did. Boy did it ever. Anyhow, one thing you have to know about ""Day"", is that it's not a movie merely starring Mr. Mark Wahlberg (his trouper supposedly didn't exist). Yeah he's probably the biggest known headliner and yeah, his name is at the top of the poster. Still, Patriots Day is not that kind of thriller. The more realistic players are the heightened city of Boston, the real-life people that the film honors, and well, the flick's disciplined attention to particulars. ""Day"" is told chronologically, with title cards listing various characters, various Massachusetts locales, and time allocated after the infamous Boston Marathon bombings (""Day's"" main intrigue). It's the info you never knew even though the happenings were all over the media circa 2013. As a movie, I would've thrown out ""Day's"" last ten minutes which feel like a separate documentary about the bombing victims. As a paean to said victims however, it seems totally justified. The Boston Marathon bombings signified the truest threat of U.S. terrorism since 9/11. Even though they occurred only three years prior, Patriots Day doesn't give you the feeling that it's too soon for a movie to come out about the whole thing. Heck, Berg as always, has had the utmost sympathy for tragic, true-life happenings anyway.Salutes and testimonials aside, ""Day's"" cast is adequate with well known veterans like John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, J, K. Simmons, and Michelle Monaghan inhabiting all 133 minutes. The music which I feel is everything, is by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It's all tops. It's seething and numbing and gives Patriots Day a supremely hard edge to it. Getting back to Peter Berg, well his direction is gritty, intrepid, and balls out. The strongest part of ""Day"" is when the young bombers are trying to escape. They murder, steal cars, kidnap, and finally have a standoff with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown. This standoff is violent and bloody with guns blazing and explosives erupting. I guess it could offend the people who lived through this experience because it turns ""Day"" into a sort of Michael Mann action film. Oh well. I found it tension-filled. My heart was racing and my stomach was in my throat. Overall, Patriots Day is powerful and graphic. It's not just a movie, it's an experience. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",Patriots Day
58,vengeance20,A good film based on real life events!,8,1 March 2017,"Saw this film at the weekend but had no idea what it was about, I thought it was going to be another one of those films about America, but it was then I found from watching it, that it was based off the Boston Marathon Bombing which occurred on the 15th April, 2013! It was a good film with some great action sequences & mayhem going on, not to mention some edge of your seat tension & suspense at some points! Though it did drag a bit, there was tons of action, gun blazing, exploding action round nearly every corner!The end memorial & stock footage of the real life events was a great end to the film remember all those who either lost their lives, or got seriously injured with the life changing injuries they all suffered because of them terrorist pr!cks! It was also great to see those brothers get justice, not to mention those who obstructed the course of justice & that brave man who got held hostage!Overall a decent watch! 8/10",Patriots Day
59,mhorg2018,"It was OK, and too many reviewers are hysterical.",4,23 March 2018,"So some reviewers found this Islamaphobic and Anti-Islam. Are you aware that the two bombers were Islamic? So that eliminates your silly argument. As for the movie itself, it was just OK. I find Wahlberg barely tolerable at best, and the rest of the cast just seemed to wander around. The hunting of the terrorists was done decently, but overall, if I never see this again, I'd be ok with that.",Patriots Day
60,bkrauser-81-311064,Reeks of Opportunism,6,15 January 2017,"What is this movie trying to say? I ask without a desire to be controversial or contrarian towards the vast ocean of critics and filmgoers who loved this film. I'm aware of the craftsmanship involved in a film like this, I'm aware of the feats it likely took to keep this film tasteful and lord knows that to some, this movie is going to feel like a satisfactory catharsis. In interviews director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have stated the film should be seen as a movie about a city coming together to fight evil. ""The more research I did, the more I realized it really was an example of a community working together"" said Berg. But despite good intentions and diplomatic words (or lip service depending on how close you are to this), at the end of the day I still need to ask myself, what really, is the point here?The main story of Patriots Day needs no retelling. I'm sure a lot of Americans are acutely aware of where they were on April 15, 2013; certainly every Bostonian is. The dramatic arc of the movie and part of what makes the movie so ""tasteful"" is it bends and weaves through the lives of different people intimately involved in the terrorist plot. Such people include Patrick Downes (O'Shea) and Jessica Kensky (Brosnahan), a young couple injured by the first explosion; Officer Sean Collier (Picking), the MIT policeman who was shot and killed in the line of duty; Chinese national Dun Meng (Yang) who was briefly held hostage by the bombers and Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (Simmons) who brought down the elder of the Tsarnaev brothers.Then of course there's Mark Wahlberg who plays the very fictional and very chuckle-headed Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg); a Boston cop whose story, I think, is meant to serve as connective tissue. His character provides a very insidious discord; not only because his inclusion in everything from the bombing, to the shootout, to the final arrest is downright serendipitous, but because he pulls focus in order to rationalize vigilante justice. He waxes poetically about moral absolutes, gets in the face of investigative brass, jumps every preordained hoop that gets him closer to the bad guys and still has time to weep over the aftermath of the attack. Come to think of it, Wahlberg's not just connective tissue, he's the whole f***ing box and at some point in the film his mugging just stops becoming forgivable.The other odious element of the film is the inclusion, exploration and exploitation of the Tsarnaev brothers played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze. They are introduced amid a flurry of intros in the first ten minutes - the score bellowing in minor keys as Tamerlan (Melikidze) watches ISIS videos while consuming Cheerios. Now while there's no inherent problem with heavily inferring these guys are, in fact the bad guys, the movie is supposedly intended to be ""about Boston"". So why include these characters at all? What insights can be gained about the grit and determination of Beantown from a pair of sad, pathetic, anti-social wannabe terrorists? Nothing - unless the goal of their inclusion is to exploit our fears and make them something more than a pair of sad, pathetic, anti-social wannabe terrorists.To that end the film does a pretty fine job being a taut, story beat conscious piece of bluster that elevates what was in reality a messy, painstaking investigation into a simplistic fight between good vs. evil. Meanwhile the Tsarnaev clowns and to a lesser extent the elder's wife (Benoist) are all portrayed as the apex of storybook evil. The kind of evil that only loosely wears a human face. It's a tact that despite being easily digestible is immediately complicated when you consider the younger Tsarnaev is awaiting an appeal of his death sentence and the wife (whom the movie heavily implies knew everything), is still around and bracing for a new glut of death threats.It's interesting to note that Patriots Day is the result of two separate scripts combined to make one big compromised movie. And while you can tell great pains were exercised in the service of this film, the end result still feels like a tug-o-war. There's the fictional composite lead and the true-to-life ensemble. There's the genre clichés artlessly retrofitted with the honest human elements. There's the story of hope in the face of terror, shadowed by an agenda that cheapens the whole ordeal. What's truly lost in the smoke, mirrors and Markie Mark chest beating is the actual story of Boston. A story that could have yielded a rich civic mosaic. Instead what we got was a movie that just reeks of opportunism.",Patriots Day
61,shakercoola,Stirring and solid true-life thriller,7,4 February 2019,"An American action-drama; A story about a police sergeant appointed to security duty for the 2013 Boston marathon, who gets caught up in the aftermath of the bombing. Drawn into the FBI investigation he aims to hunt down the bombers before they flee the city.
This fact-based account tells of a community's courage in the face of terror. Mark Wahlberg plays a fictional character, a composite of the courage under fire police officers, joining other courageous survivors, first responders and investigators. A strong narrative pulse drives this tense thriller and patriotism lies at the heart of the film. It doesn't stray into exploitation and resolves to full poignancy by the end.",Patriots Day
62,FlushingCaps,"Tons of cussing, violence, and tense police action",7,16 January 2017,"We saw this in the theater on January 14. I read all available IMDb reviews and am writing this because two rather important elements were not mentioned in any reviews I saw. To me, a review should help potential viewers decide if they would like to see the film in question.First, the basics: This is a gritty, adult-oriented film about the horrible bombings at the 2014 Boston Marathon that killed 3 people and lead to 280 people being injured and two additional police officers being killed in the manhunt that followed. It is quite fact-based, designed to let viewers see the horror of it all, and how the police agencies worked diligently to capture the Islamic terrorists who perpetrated the whole thing.The film begins with an unrelated police raid the night before the marathon, where we focus on a policeman, Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg), who, I've learned, represents a composite of several real officers involved in the actual events. This is a common ploy by filmmakers because viewers feel lost if the movie keeps showing so many different police officers accurately doing their parts and there's no continuity in who we are watching. We get, in the beginning scenes, several vignettes of actors portraying different real people, preparing to watch or participate in the marathon. These brief introductions let us feel a connection to the real people, some of whom are shown in film-ending scenes talking about their lives and how they were changed by the bombings.Scenes of the race, the crowds, the finish line site that was bombed and the mass confusion and bloodshed lead to how police investigate. A command center was established in an old warehouse, a large part of which was used to lay out clothing and belongings found at the bomb site, putting everything gathered on a recreated bomb site. A large part of the investigation involved finding video footage of people, searching for possible suspects, and later, publicizing the photos of the two suspects, seeking public help in identifying the perpetrators.We also saw in the opening sequences before the marathon, and later on, scenes involving the brother who carried out the bombings. We weren't meant to get to like them, but we saw a couple of scenes of the pair who lived together with the older one's wife and their young daughter. It was clear that the wife knew just what they were planning and was in full support. It was also clear that the older brother was in charge, but that the 19-year-old, while he argued about what specific actions they should take, was totally willing to kill as many innocent people as possible.We later saw a scene where the wife of the lead terrorist was being questioned. She revealed nothing and, we were told at the end of the movie, was never arrested for her part in the whole thing.It took several days for authorities to find these punks, with the biggest key being a young man who was kidnapped by the pair, as they stole all the money they could from his bank accounts via an ATM, and drove his car. The young man was able to escape and phone police, leading to a police chase which had a huge gunfight in nearby Watertown resulting in another officer being killed (in addition to a separate killing by one of the brothers) and 16 more officers being injured in the gunfight that ended when the younger brother escaped, driving a stolen car, smashing through police cars and driving over his injured brother, killing him accidentally, as he tried to make his getaway.Almost anyone old enough to see this film remembers where the younger brother was found hiding. Seeing how many police were involved and how they went about this capture was quite interesting.The film includes many bloody scenes of people's injuries, at crime scenes and in hospitals. These scenes are important to show the horror of it all—to make sure we don't gloss over what these two evil people did.Now for the two overlooked elements of this movie: First is the use of a spinning camera, panning about various scenes at such a speed as to possibly make you dizzy. Some scenes designed to show the chaos of the bombing see things whirling around too fast to see clearly. Viewers close to the movie screen might find themselves a bit queasy if not worse. If you are sensitive to such scenes, I'd advise you to close you eyes for a few seconds.Another topic not discussed much is the cussing, particularly the so-called ""F-bomb."" I'll estimate that had they chopped out 85 uses of this word, there would still have been at least four dozen times when you hear it.Largely, the situations seemed like one where you might expect to hear cussing. This isn't a lighthearted comedy or a movie that would be interesting to kids. But they could have reduced the cursing and still kept it gritty. Like any word or expression, overuse reduces or destroys the effectiveness of the term. A remake of Gone With the Wind made today would likely have had Rhett cussing frequently, which would make the famous line near the end totally forgettable, instead of being one of the most famous lines in Hollywood history, made so because it did stand out thanks to the use of one normally-forbidden word. If you are troubled by hearing F and S words in shows, you probably will not want to see this movie because there is so much profanity used throughout the film.Otherwise, it is a tense, police-action film full of violent scenes that depicts a horrible event that will never be forgotten. I give it a 7.",Patriots Day
63,Screen_Blitz,Patriots Day is a riveting tribute to it's real-life tragedy with an alluring story and direction in the bargain,8,25 January 2017,"Our country is no stranger to terrorist attacks, and though we have not experienced any sort of event on the scale of the 9/11 attacks, terrorism has increased in a near-alarming rate. This police procedural drama directed by Peter Berg, the filmmaker behind 'Deepwater Horizon' which hit theaters just four months ago, paints a riveting picture of a shocking tragedy that gripped our nation to it's core. That tragedy was the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing by that took a great number of innocent lives. Collaborating with Peter Berg for a third time is Mark Wahlberg who we saw in 'Deepwater Horizon' not too long ago along with the war drama 'Lone Survivor' three years ago. Like Peter Berg's previous two entries, Wahlberg along with a string of A-list actors shine in this moving docudrama following the heroes that sought out justice against the tyrants responsible for the horrifying tragedy. Inspired by true events, Mark Wahlberg plays police officer Tommy Saunders who's assigned by Commissioner Ed Davis (played by John Goodman) who patrol the street on the morning of the Boston Marathon. What starts off as an exciting day turns into a blistering tragedy at the sound of pressure cooker bombs going off in the crowd. With several casualties and many others rushed to the hospital, Saunders, Davis, along with Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (played by J.K Simmons) must collaborate with FBI agent Richard DesLauriers (played by Kevin Bacon) to hunt down the Muslim terrorists (played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze) responsible for the bombing.Peter Berg rarely pulls punches when re-imagining real-life events on screen (as demonstrated in his previous two films), nor does he take sheer sentimentality for granted which splashes in our faces during the final twenty minutes. And similarly to 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Lone Survivor', Berg effectively present a real-life tragedy into a cinematic entry not geared to entertain, but to tell an honest story of the tragedy that unfolded. This film opens up the night before the tragedy before quickly shifting to the day of the Boston Marathon where the participants and the spectators were gutted with a huge explosion that claims a great number of lives. Although the bombing sequence is highly predictable for those familiar with the event, it does virtually nothing to eliminate the sense of dread and anxiety during the opening minutes of the marathon. Following the gruesome imagery of the debacle, this film ventures through the story of the statewide manhunt after the terrorist involved in the incident. For those who keep an open eye on the news, it is easy predict the final outcome. But the film explores the untold trajectory of the manhunt, and Peter Berg executes the event in a series of pulse-pounding sequences with solidly crafted thrills and shock. Along the way (mostly during the beginning), the story also explores a multiplex of characters connected to the incident including the domestic lives of the terrorists Dzhokhar Tsarneav and his brother Tamerlan Tsnarneav who's sinister motives aren't given too much depth but are thinly hinted through their commentary of America's supposed ""islamophobia"". One of their conversations consists of a 9/11 conspiracy that the government used as a tool for promote hatred Muslims. As jarring as it sounds, it partly accounts the brooding chemistry between these two as they steal the screen in not one, but two incredibly startling scenes during the final third.Peter Berg populates the story with a wide range of characters that the film rarely breathes any time to develop most of these characters other than Mark Wahlberg's Tommy Saunders and the aforementioned Muslim brothers. But if there is anything keep most of these character breathing with authenticity, it is the cast's solid performances. With Mark Wahlberg teaming up with director Peter Berg for the third time, he steps into the shoes of not a real-life figure but a fictional character inspired by a composite of the real-life heroes involved the seeking of justice. Like in 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Lone Survivor', Wahlberg comes out on screen with a bang. John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, and J.K Simmons also stand very rigid in their roles; though nothing that shouts for powerful memorability considering the underdeveloped characters. Michelle Monaghan provides a decent on screen presence but it sadly left with very little to do other than provide as a filler. Arguably two of the most alarming performances are Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze who suit up in the roles of nefarious terrorists, and with a competent screenplay are nicely portrayed with legitimacy rather than exploitation. That is doesn't however, reduce how dark and grim nature of their antagonistic characters.Patriots Day is a riveting tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon Bombing, with an alluring direction by Peter Berg and a story set to inspire. Though it does not shy away the run-of-the-mill tropes of the police drama genre, it effectively breathes life into a story that is set not to necessarily entertain but to inspire.",Patriots Day
64,Troy_Campbell,An intelligent and thoughtful tribute.,8,3 February 2017,"Reliving the horrible events of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing so soon after it transpired is a risky move. A misstep here can make the whole movie reek of profit-making from a tragedy, a misstep there and you have a slavish recreation that offers no entry into the story on a personal level. It was only a few months ago that director Peter Berg and actor Mark Whalberg gave us the wonderful Deepwater Horizon—a true story about an oil rig disaster—but they've managed to back that up with another triumph-against-all-odds real life tale. Berg introduces us to a plethora of characters in the first act that, although initially unrelated, we know will all be linked together under horrendous circumstances, imbuing the entire set-up with a dread that gets under the skin. Yet no amount of being prepared for what is to come makes the gut punch any softer; the chaos and agony of the bombings are depicted with such ferocity that it's a purely visceral experience of the highest order. Not surprisingly the film wanes a little bit once the focus shifts to tracking down the perpetrators, but as we spend a rather large portion of screen time with the terrorists, the hunt becomes a tense cat-and-mouse affair between monsters who'll kill anyone and an entire city out for justice. We view the complete string of events through the eyes of Whalberg's experienced cop SGT Tommy Saunders—a fictional amalgamation of real-life first responders—allowing the mass heartache of a whole population to be condensed into one relatable, likable man. Thankfully Whalberg is in top form; his Tommy is one part an older, wearier version of SGT Dignam (the sharp-tongued hard-nut played by Whalberg in The Departed) and one part American hero. Considering Berg built a reputation as a Michael Bay-esque style-over-substance filmmaker, it would appear a career course-correct has occurred; Patriots Day (and Deepwater Horizon before it) is an intelligent, thoughtful and emotional tribute to the victims and heroes of a truly terrible event.",Patriots Day
65,leftbanker-1,Much Better than I Expected,7,13 January 2017,"The film did a great job of showing what a couple of freaking half-wits the bombers were and how quickly our law enforcement agencies wrapped up their capture. It also showed the police doing their job in a fashion that doesn't match the precision and daring of what you see in most cop movies. If the movie is accurate at all it was a total mess. And then we learn the loser was on a watch list. Yet even though the police didn't look like something out of a James Bond movie they wrapped the case in less than a week. Bravo, BPD!The movie also pointed out something that I have been saying for quite some time, that just about all of these Muslim terrorists are about as religious as I am and I'm an atheist. The one thing they all have in common is that they are all total freaking losers and morons. It doesn't take any intelligence to kill innocent people so it's not like they are some sort of criminal masterminds. They are just miserable creeps who have done nothing with their lives and at the last minute they decide to go for glory and then do some obscene crap in the name of Islam. I can't believe that his whore wife was never charged with a crime. There is just no possible way that his whore wasn't involved.A few negative notes. All of the up-close and personal moments dragged the movie down and damaged the pacing. I would have preferred more Kevin Bacon and less Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg's good vs evil, love vs hate speech was poorly written which made it maudlin instead of effective.",Patriots Day

Director Peter Berg and star Mark Wahlberg again in this production, and it's their most effective pairing yet. ""Patriots Day"" also drops in on a handful of other characters we'll get to know over the course of the plot, including a policeman on the campus of MIT, a couple running in the race, as well as a police officer in nearby Watertown.

Overall it works perfectly.",Patriots Day
67,blott2319-1,Decent but not all that special,6,9 October 2021,"I do find the nature of real-life police investigation to be interesting, and that was by far the most worthwhile part of Patriots Day. In truth this film is hindered by the fact that someone wanted to put Mark Wahlberg as the face of the movie, because this should have been a complete ensemble where the entire cast of law enforcement shared the limelight as they worked through their investigation. I also found it strange that they switched away from the police work in order to spend a significant amount of the film following the bombers themselves. I think this is because there simply wasn't enough story to tell on either side, so they lumped it all into one film. The Boston marathon bombing was certainly a notable event, but perhaps it wasn't complex or involved enough to support a feature film. Finally, while the shaky handheld cinematography works to create the chaos in the wake of the bombing and the chase scenes, it was a bit excessive in some of the more static moments that could have used a steady cam. But I was definitely engaged through the whole movie, even if I suspect a short documentary on the subject would have been just as engaging as Patriots Day.",Patriots Day
68,kz917-1,"Slightly muddled, but good",7,10 April 2017,"Could this movie have been better, yes. Did they do a number of things right, absolutely. Mark Wahlberg's character Tommy Saunders was purposefully a combination of a number of officers involved the day of the bombing. OK, I get the need for that; but the backstory of his ""altered"" duty due to some indiscretion only mucked up the story and confused the plot. The viewer is well aware of the real life events that took place. Also, when they introduce the characters that are horrifically impacted that day, they could have done a better job at the beginning by telling us how they are impacted when they are introduced and how they are today. Good movie, could have been much better.",Patriots Day
69,rockman182,Patriots Day (2016),7,12 January 2017,"Peter Berg returned very soon after Deepwater Horizon, with yet another film based on a true event. Patriots Day is a film based on the 2013 Boston marathon bombings by the Tsarnaev brothers. Interestingly, this film also circles around a fictional cop (played by Mark Wahlberg) so we've got a mix of fiction with reality. I'm not the biggest fan of Berg's films but there is no denying he can do tense action scenes very well.The film is a mixed bag but I'm leaning more on the positive side. The film's depictions of the violence and gore minutes after the attack, do not hold back. You don't expect it to either, especially if you are aware of Berg's track record. The sheer brutality of the event is captured, much like the war violence captured in Lone Survivor. Some of the chase and gunfights is absolutely enthralling as well. The final showdown between the older Tsarnaev and the police is very well done. It is gripping and remarkably captivating. I understand the original account of the events is a haze but the encounter must have been intense, going by the films depiction.Getting back to the mixed bag bit here are the few things that detract from the film. The film starts out introducing a bunch of characters who are impacted in one way or the other by the event. This is necessarily not a bad thing in and of it self but it takes away from the films focus and too many characters equates for not enough weight given to each other. Some characters are purely devices to elicit an emotional response. The film also suffers from a long run time, condensing the film would have led to a more focused effort. The film seems to be a mishmash at times. The director must have wanted to just include all the scenes filmed, which impacts the narrative element of the film.I was also not sure about the film being made. The events are very fresh and must still be really shocking for a lot of people impacted by the event. I can see why people would find this film to be exploitative. But on the other hand, films are a good way of educating people on the events of a true story. I assume the film was fairly accurate, so even I was able to learn a lot about the events. Also, Alex Wolff seemed like a dead ringer for the younger bomber.It's just about what you expect from Peter Berg. A film that does action very well, but a film that suffers from bloated length and could have used a better approach to telling the story. The film isn't absolutely necessary however its quite enjoyable and will provide for an entertaining, emotional, and enjoyable time for its viewers. I guess at the end of the day that's what you want from your media.7/10",Patriots Day

With them really showing everything, all the injuries and such makes it even more emotional. All the different perspectives was a nice addition as you get to see all the sides of the story which is needed. The writers and editing team have made it easy for us to follow the story and characters with specific time and names of the real people which helps a lot, it flows together nicely. The writing and acting made for some top notch drama. Costumes were authentic and perfect, It was on point. The action sequences in the last part of the movie was raw, gritty and overall entertaining to watch thanks to how it was shot.The ensemble cast is filled with known and recognizable actors and everyone did a great job, nothing was award worthy but it was still great performances, truly capturing the emotion and feelings of the horrible events. Peter Berg's vision and directing was great. I've to agree that it was one of the best movies of 2016. Seeing the after credits scenes is truly heartbreaking and sad, they stayed true to what happened and it is probably the only way to do it.",Patriots Day
71,RforFilm,"Patriots Day may have too much heart for it's own good, but it's still an inspiring, entertaining look at the tragic events",7,24 January 2017,"One question I get a lot from my family that only sees me every so often is, ""when are you gonna get married and have some children?"". The marriage question is more of a matter of finding the right person, in which only time has been a barrier. The kids question is more of a moral issue. While I would eventually like to have a little one running around, I'd just prefer to not do it in the world were currently living in. It doesn't have to do anything with politics, but rather safety. It sickens me that were forced to cope with an environment where madmen could set off catastrophic events.The past ten years have been difficult with the shootings in Orlando, Paris, and San Bernardino not to mention the constant use of excessive force from police officers putting a lot of fear over the use of guns. Things took another turn when in 2013 during the Boston Marathon, two bombs were detonated, injuring and killing several runners and bystanders. This has all been in the name of the terrorist group ISIS which remains one the nations biggest threats. The story of Boston is recounted in Patriots Day. Sergeant Tommy Saunders (played by Mark Wahlberg) was one of many police officers that were assigned to the Boston Marathon finish line. As history has revealed, two explosions ruin what was supposed to be a typical fun day for the city. Clearly never expecting such an atrocity, Boston freezes in terror while trying to make the first move to help as many of the injured as possible. Police Commissioner Ed Davis (played by John Goodman) and Mayor Thomas Menino (played by Vincent Curatola) make the decision to rule the event a terrorist attack when the first pieces of evidence are collected.In the shadows, bombers Dzhokhar and Tasmerlan Tsarnaev are making plans to set up their next target somewhere in New York City. In this process, they are trying to cover any tracks they've created, trying to get rid of any connection.The investigation quickly becomes an FBI and homeland security investigation when Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (played by Kevin Bacon) arrives to take charge. While all parties are trying to act according to plan to catch the bombers, there is clearly a feeling of intrusion with the government trying to do everything when the local police feel like they're capable of finding the culprits.What's interesting is that director Peter Berg directed another American tragedy story last year with Deepwater Horizon. Both also had actor Mark Wahlberg as the lead. The two must be good friends if both tend to continue making these kinds of movies. That is no way a bad thing, as Patriots Day is still a good movie, possibly better then Deepwater Horizon. It's biggest strength is that the movie is more focused on the investigation then it is on the tragic events. It could have been easy to put all the attention there and make it a weep-fest. Peter Berg made the decision craft the event into something cinematic in the style of several stories being told over the days unfolding after the bombing. The downside is that certain plots, like one of a father searching for his child and a couple separated by hospitals, tend to be halted in favor of the main character or the bombers. Either more time was needed to develop some of these victims or they should have gotten their own movies. I'm glad I saw this for the elements I did enjoy, like Mark Wahlberg and it's CSI-like tone.I'll give this seven Boston Marathon shoes out of ten. If not fully interesting throughout, it at least has a lot of good things that make it hard to not recommend this movie. I'll say right up that while they do show the bombers Muslim religion, it's not that offensive. This is a movie the knows it's audience; middle class Americans that'll want more of an enjoyable tribute to Boston's dedication then a psychological look into the tragedy. There's nothing wrong with that, so take it for what is is and see if you'll run with it.",Patriots Day
72,rbrb,***** City with a Soul *****,10,1 April 2017,"A excellent movie meriting top marks.Many people world-wide will recall following the events of the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013. This film attempts to show many aspects of the horror of what happened.In my opinion this picture is compelling viewing from start to finish. Whilst some parts may be fictionalized there are sound reasons for that and it seems to me the key events portrayed are factual.The whole production without exception is brilliant and the characters are shown to be real people caught up in a tragedy.And the film makers have done a truly professional job i) in presenting the carnage and consequences of the bombers actions, ii) weaving together actual footage into this real life drama, and iii)showing how proper detective work solves cases.I believe this film is so good it will serve to dissuade some with criminal intentions.....Boston: 10/10.",Patriots Day
73,spookyrat1,Comes Together!,8,4 March 2019,"Peter Berg has a propensity to make movies based on recent events with tragic outcomes. Lone Survivor was gripping. Deepwater Horizon sans much of an ecological message, just seemed quite pointless, being another (ho-hum!) disaster movie. With Patriots Day, he seems to have his mojo back telling a big, largely true story about a terrorist bomb attack during the 2013 Boston Marathon and its aftermath and successfully approaching it from different fronts.Ironically, though very well received critically and also by the audiences that have seen it, commercially it pretty much tanked with a main reason commonly cited being the involvement of ( Boston-born) Mark Wahlberg playing a composite police officer character. I think the criticisms are unfair and unfounded. Let's be very clear. Wahlberg doesn't play some super cop hero. He is more of a linkage character to the various sub-stories, arguably ensuring that a two and a quarter hour movie didn't blow out to being a three and a quarter how movie, by including extra real life characters and unnecessary exposition. As it stands the production team has done an excellent job casting a host of very competent actors who really do look like their real life counterparts. The post credits interviews, photos and news footage attests to this.BTW I should add here that there is a good deal of news footage integrated into the feature cleverly and seamlessly.Mention should also be made of the fact that the film doesn't just focus on the explosions and subsequent police/FBI/CIA manhunt for the perpetrators. That is the basis of the main thread, but the narrative does include stories of survivors, whilst tipping its hat, as mentioned in the final credits dedication to the first responders of these sort of emergencies; the fire brigades and medical personnel, besides the afore-mentioned police.That director Berg is able to fashion a coherent, suspenseful, drama out of this sad piece of history, whilst essentially telling a true, ultimately uplifting story is a credit to him as a story teller.",Patriots Day
74,dave-mcclain,"""Patriots Day"" is very well acted by its talented cast, perfectly paced and has its focus in the right place.",8,17 January 2017,"The word ""patriot"", according to dictionary.com, means ""a person who loves, supports, and defends his or her country and its interests with devotion"". That's what a small group of armed militia known as ""minutemen"" did near Boston, Massachusetts on April 19, 1775, when they fired on British troops, beginning the American Revolutionary War. The New England states of Massachusetts and Maine (which, until 1820, was part of Massachusetts), commemorate the anniversary of that day as an official state holiday, since 1969, celebrating it on the third Monday in April. According to Wikipedia.com, ""The biggest celebration of Patriots' Day is the Boston Marathon, which has been run every Patriots' Day since April 19, 1897 to mark the then-recently established holiday."" The local and national pride exhibited on Patriots' Day took on new meaning after being attacked at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, an event depicted in the 2016 historical drama/thriller ""Patriots Day"" (R, 2:13).The film focuses on the people personally affected by the bombing. Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) is a dedicated Sergeant in the Boston Police Department and has a devoted wife (Michelle Monaghan) who works as an RN. Tommy is friendly with Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman) and both end up working closely on the bombing investigation with Boston Police Superintendent William Evans (James Colby), FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola) and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach). But before we get to that point, we meet Watertown police officer Jeffrey Pugliese (J. K. Simmons), Chinese immigrant Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang) who is bragging on the phone to his parents about his new SUV, MIT police officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking) who is making plans with some grad students to go to a concert, married couple Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky (Christopher O'Shea and Rachel Brosnahan) who are discussing their plans for the day, and Boston residents and radical Islamists Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolfe and Themo Melikidze) who are making a plan which will disrupt the lives of all of those people, a plan which Tamerlan's wife (Melissa Benoist) may or may not know about beforehand.Early on Marathon Monday, Commissioner Davis is near the race's finish line and greets Sergeant Saunders, who is simply working security due to an injured knee. Saunders calls his wife to ask her to bring him his bigger knee brace, while Downes and Kensky prepare to join hundreds of thousands of others to watch the marathon. The race goes off without a hitch, until a group of runners are about to cross the finish line and a bomb goes off, followed by another less than 15 seconds later. As frightened bystanders flee and the injured and dead lie on the ground, the Boston police jump into action. Soon, Special Agent DesLauriers arrives on the scene and declares the explosions an act of terrorism. He sets up a large command center in an empty warehouse where agents pour over photos and videos from the scene, desperate to find whoever is responsible for the bombing. After identifying two ball cap wearing persons of interest, which they initially refer to as ""black hat"" and ""white hat"", the investigators argue over whether to release the images to the public. Meanwhile, the Tsarnaev brothers are lying low at home, but soon decide to get moving again and begin planning another bombing. Then the brothers run into local police in Watertown – on April 19th, the exact anniversary of that day in 1775 when the citizens of Massachusetts confronted foreigners whom they accused of terrorist acts.""Patriots Day"" is very well acted by its talented cast and perfectly paced by director Peter Berg (in the midst of his third collaboration with Wahlberg – after 2013's ""Lone Survivor"" and 2016's ""Deepwater Horizon""), but this movie's main strength is its script by Berg, Matt Cook and Joshua Zeturner. Terrorism is ultimately about the people involved – the perpetrators and their victims – and this film does a great job of personalizing its story and humanizing those affected. ""Patriots Day"" keeps a broad scope (combining the concepts for two proposed movies about the bombing and its aftermath, including one based on the 2015 book ""Boston Strong: A City's Triumph Over Tragedy"") which gives its audience a good overview of what happened, but tells the story from ground level, through the eyes of its main characters. However, we get little insight into the lives of the Tsarnaev brothers and what motivated them, but that's not what this movie is about. ""Patriots Day"" mainly concerns itself with the effect the bombing had on its victims and the exceptional spirit, strength and resilience of the City of Boston. From that perspective, the film works well as history lesson, police procedural and mostly, human drama. ""A-""",Patriots Day
75,Danusha_Goska,An Efficient Thriller that Takes No Risks,7,17 January 2017,"""Patriot's Day"" is an efficient little thriller that recreates the events of April 15, 2013, when the Tsarnaev brothers detonated two bombs during the Boston Marathon. Mark Wahlberg stars as a police officer, but there is really no main character in this movie. It is more of a docudrama, moving from event to event, from one person affected by the bomb to the next. We are introduced to, and spend a few minutes with each of the victims, police officers, FBI agents, and unidentified interrogators. We visit in the Tsarnaev home previous to the bombing. We watch as the governor ponders the decision to shut the city down. We watch police go from house to house in Watertown, seeking Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. It's all very suspenseful and interesting but the film made no lasting impact on me. ""Patriot's Day"" never takes any of the risks that might propel it into the territory of memorable art. It takes virtually no stand on the many questions this bombing prompts us to ask. The Tsarnaev family were immigrants. They applied for political asylum. They were, for all intents and purposes, Muslim refugees, though they were never given the ""refugee"" designation. There is a debate going on around the world right now about what to do about Muslim refugees from war-torn regions, and whether or not taking in Muslim refugees is safe for the receiving country. ""Patriot's Day"" goes nowhere near this question. There is also a debate about what to do about terrorists' family members. Noor Salman, the wife of the Orlando terrorist, was arrested on January 16, 2017. What about Katherine Russell, the widow of Tamerlane Tsarnaev? Before the bombing, Russell performed a google search of the rewards Islam offers to the wife of a dead Muslim terrorist. This is mentioned in the film. Russell is shown living in the same tiny apartment with the brothers, where they prepared the bomb. The film implies that she was aware of their plans. She is free and no charges have been brought against her. The film depicts Russell being interrogated by a woman in a hijab. The suggestion is that America needs good Muslims to fight bad Muslims. In any case, the interrogator gets nothing out of Russell. In addition to following police officers and other first responders, the film also follows the victims. The viewer is given a brief intro to young lovers whose legs must be amputated. Eight-year-old Catholic schoolboy Martin Richard was the youngest victim. The film does not show him alive. We see, rather, a cloth covering a very small body. We see the cloth rippling in the wind, and a police officer standing guard over the body till investigators can address the corpse without disturbing evidence. In fact the bomb tore Martin's little body apart. The damage was described at the trial. Martin Richard's beautiful face, in a photograph radiating young life, innocence and hope, is shown on screen after the film concludes.",Patriots Day
76,swilliky,Feels somewhat early but a powerful film,7,16 January 2017,"Peter Berg has been chronicling modern American history in his last few films and this movie captures the events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. As the movie captures recent events there was a fine line to walk in the making of this movie between feeling insensitive and exploitive while aiming for a more respectful take on people's tragedy that exists for people still living with vivid memories. I wouldn't know what it was like to experience that sort of chaos and pain so I can't comment on how the movie felt for those who experienced it. I felt it was respectful and took a more historical approach though I wouldn't agree to adding to the story of the cowardly brothers and their selfish, cruel act. The story follows several characters but primarily Detective Tommy Saunder (Mark Wahlberg) who was reprimanded for rough treatment of a suspect. He is forced to guard the finish line by Commission Ed Davis (John Goodman) as his one last hoop to jump through. Little does he know that he will be at the spot of history where tragedy suddenly erupts. He invites his wife Carol (Michelle Monaghan) to see him right where the bomb will be laid.Cehck out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Patriots Day
77,bob-the-movie-man,A Marathon Investigation,8,18 March 2017,"While there are predictable social media conspiracy theories that the ""whole thing was a hoax"", the two bombs that went off near the finish line of the Boston marathon on April 15th 2013 killed three members of the public and injured more than 250 others. It was a life- changing event for those people and their immediate families, but sadly nothing more than a small footnote in the global story of car bombs and suicide missions that have killed and maimed thousands and thousands of people in war-stricken countries around the world in recent years. It's a point not lost on the scriptwriters of ""Patriot's Day"", the new film by Peter Berg (""Deepwater Horizon""). In an America where press freedom seems to be under increasing threat, the film refreshingly provides room for reflecting the antagonists' views, twisted and barking as they may be, and the film is better for that. Mark Wahlberg (""Deepwater Horizon"", ""Ted"") plays senior Boston homicide cop Tommy Saunders. He's on menial duties after a past indiscretion, but has just one last day stewarding the finish line of the Boston marathon before being allowed off the 'naughty step' by his boss, Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodson). Saunders is seen off to work by his wife (Michelle Monaghan, Mrs. Hunt from the Mission Impossible films) but his dull day's work is not going to go as planned thanks to the fanatical Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) and his compliant but bullied brother Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff). The pair plant the bombs along Boylston Street, wreaking havoc on American soil, and a massive man-hunt ensues that will see other lives impacted irrevocably before it's over.The storytelling is reminiscent of 70's films like ""Airport"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" in introducing us to a wide range of characters at the start of the film, without knowing how they will later be placed into the jigsaw. Examples are Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons, ""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"") of the Watertown police department who gets unexpectedly drawn into the action when chaos descends on his sleepy Boston neighborhood, and Chinese student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang in a film debut) who has an unbelievable story of first-hand contact with the bombers. Leading the FBI investigation is Richard DesLauriers (the prolific Kevin Bacon). Unfortunately I always muddle up Bacon with Wahlberg (it must be something about the facial features) so it's not helpful having them in the same film! Even though I knew (albeit vaguely) all of the details of the bombing and the subsequent events, the film successfully made me feel tense throughout. Some of the set-piece action sequences – particularly the showdown in Watertown – are particularly well done. Given the number of rounds of ammo let off and the home-made grenades being lobbed, it is astounding that dozens of officers were not killed. The film is highly respectful towards the victims of the atrocity, with one of the most moving moments of the film being a silent vigil over one of the victims by a State Trooper (Billy Donahue).Wahlberg in particular gives a great performance, with his emotional post-traumatic breakdown scene with Monaghan being his best acting performance in years. However, it is Wahlberg's character that is my major problem with the film. Unlike most of the other characters, who are based on their real-life counterparts, Tommy Saunders is a fictional composite of multiple real-life police officers, and his involvement in each and every part of the drama strained credibility to breaking point for me. It would have been far more effective, in my view, to stick nearer to reality and have a range of other cameos step into those roles.There is a tendency (for this British viewer at least) for the film to overreach with its stirring patriotic message in the closing scenes, and there was the predictable trotting out of the 'real life' photos and videos in the finale, albeit that some of these are movingly portrayed. Apart from those reservations, this is a solidly well-made piece of docufiction that is enjoyable throughout.Just a warning to sensitive viewers that there are obviously some scenes of bodily injury included: if grading on as scale where ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a 10 and ""Saving Private Ryan"" an 8, then ""Patriot's Day"" would rate about a 7.

The emergency services are rushed in to attend to very detailed bloody injury, missing limbs, or arms and legs blown apart. The authorities feared there may be more bombs ready to detonate so they needed to find the perpetrators, they needed to move very quickly.The film cleverly incorporates actual video surveillance footage from grainy CCTV and mobile phones taken at the time. It's tense, it's exciting, the background music is moody, some scenes are hard to watch. The film shows the strength of the human spirit, the strength of the community, the brave people that came together, stood strong and supported each-other.The disaster yielded the slogan ""Boston Strong"" (says it all).At the end we see tributes from some of the actual survivors and police officers involved at the time, we also learn that the captured bomber has appealed his lethal injection sentence!",Patriots Day

80,virek213,"April 15, 2013: Horror And Heroism In Boston",9,17 January 2017,"After September 11, 2001, America was no longer immune to the ravages of international terrorism. Although the 9/11 attacks on New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, which killed nearly three thousand people, were never replicated inside America's borders, there have nevertheless been terrorist incidents since then, two of them during 2015 and 2016, in San Bernardino, California (in December 2015), and Orlando, Florida (in June 2016). But perhaps the biggest terrorist incident occurred on April 15, 2013 at the finish line of the 117th annual Boston Marathon. Two pressure cooker bombs packed in backpacks and left along the sidewalk along Boylston Street, close to the end of the race, exploded in the crowd, killing three people and wounding 264 others, some of them quite severely. The full forces of the Boston Police Department, the state law enforcement of Massachusetts, and the FBI, even with their occasional internecine feuding, worked together to track down the responsible parties, two Chechan brothers named Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a manhunt that took 100 hours and ended in a Boston suburb. This horrible day and the subsequent manhunt are the subject of the 2016 film PATRIOTS DAY (the designation for April 15th in Boston).The film's sizeable cast of stars features Mark Wahlberg as Boston cop Tommy Saunders, who was at the finish line on that day and at the moment when the two explosions went off, just 200 feet from where he was standing. Pretty soon, Boston police commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), FBI agent Rick DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) and Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) are on hand to determine who pulled off the horror at the marathon. But in the meanwhile, the two suspects (portrayed by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze) are still on the loose; and they kill MIT police officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking),following the kidnapping of a young Chinese national (Jimmy Yang). Melikidze is killed in a shootout with Watertown police and Massachusetts state troopers, but Wolff escapes. Hours later, however, he is found in a covered boat in a backyard of Watertown, a suburb of Boston. This ended one of the most sustained manhunts in U.S. history, in which the entire city of Boston and its various suburbs were placed on a police-enforced lockdown until the two assailants were caught.While it must have been tempting for Peter Berg, who also directed 2016's DEEPWATER HORIZON and is known for his fairly ultra-conservative political beliefs, to make this an anti-Islamic diatribe, and thus red meat for right-wing fanatics, that tendency is instead set aside for a step-by step recreation of those 100 hours that had to have been the most frightening in the history of Boston. It is not surprising, of course, that the sequences of the bombings and the shootouts are incredibly realistic, horrifying, and quite graphic, and that the dialogue is equally salty and profane. But instead of just being another gung-ho action flick meant to be a bromide for blind patriotism, PATRIOTS DAY looks at the best of Boston's finest and the citizens they protect in a way that was done by director Paul Greengrass in his ultra-memorable 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93. No sympathy is spared for the Tsarnaev brothers or those that protected them (though it might have been a good idea to understand how they might have become radicalized the way they were, which wasn't via the traditional Al-Qaeda way, nor through the Islamic State); this is one of the few flaws of this film.Berg very skillfully manages to edit some of the actual on-scene video camera footage from the real-life incident, and along with the blanket coverage that all Boston TV news outlets, with his recreation of the manhunt in a way that is good for the filmmaking process, but which also faithfully recreates the series of events between the bombing and the eventual capture of the surviving Tsarnaev brother (who was sentenced to death via lethal injection in 2015), without trying to capitalize on the magnitude of the tragedy at hand. Wahlberg, Goodman, Bacon, and Simmons all do good work and reasonable Boston accents, while Michelle Monaghan is equally fine in a supporting role as Wahlberg's wife. All in all, considering that it touches on the thorny, emotionally complex, and politically charged subject of terrorism, PATRIOTS DAY does it in a way that shows the very sick nature of terrorism and how we can respond to it, not with the same blind hatred of terrorism's perpetrators, but with the love and empathy that makes us Americans.",Patriots Day

I was particularly surprised by the rather nuanced portrayal of the two bombers.Like Deepwater Horizon, I feel that the closing montage of the real people involved goes for a bit too long.Also, the first act and part of the second act are full of seemingly unrelated subplots and characters.

82,SquigglyCrunch,A Jumbled Messy Bore,4,25 August 2017,"Patriots Day is about the bombing that took place in 2013 at the Boston Marathon, and follows multiple story lines revolving around that event. The movie has about 6-8 different perspectives that it follows. The one about the terrorists themselves is fairly interesting, though the movie as a whole gets pretty good towards the end. The violence is realistic and engaging, it does a great job of getting the audience into the moment. Otherwise Patriots Day sucks. For starters, the pacing is trash. For the most part the movie is incredibly boring. All the different perspectives are largely the same or just uninteresting, and the same is with the characters. Speaking of the characters, none of them are any good except for the terrorists. The opening of the movie is an introduction to all the different perspectives, and it's awful. Each one is the same thing: people happy together with dramatic music in the background. It's a horrible way to start a movie because it's so monotonous, and the characters themselves are uninteresting and unrealistic. We don't get the vibe that these characters could actually be real people. And when the bombing goes down all these characters exist as catalysts for tear bait at the end. Half of them don't get referred back to until the end of the movie when we as the audience is supposed to cry over them, but we care so little (and have largely forgotten about their problems) that it just feels lazy. I didn't even know one of the characters was the chief of police until like halfway through the movie when his role actually became important. And moreover, the movie keeps introducing new characters after the beginning. Even after the halfway point it tries to introduce new characters and it just doesn't work. It's like Peter Berg really didn't have enough ideas for a 2+ hour movie. It's the 2013 Boston Marathon, surely there's more stuff you could've done! This was a pretty big deal, surely stuff actually happened behind the scenes. The terrorists were the only interesting ones because they actually had unique motivations and complex conflicts. And for a movie where they're the bad guys, I feel like that's a bad thing. Overall Patriots Day sucks. The pacing is awful, the characters are bland, and the bad guys are the only good characters. To me, 2016 has been a bad year for Peter Berg. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",Patriots Day

84,ClaytonDavis,'Patriots Day' Is a Poignant and Affecting Portrait of a National Tragedy,7,19 February 2017,"Peter Berg knows the power of suspense, but even more than that, he knows the virtue of the human spirit, as is demonstrated by his work in ""Patriots Day."" In a year that has already included an exhilarating demonstration with ""Deepwater Horizon,"" Berg has found his niche and comfort zone within filmmaking. Compelling and sobering, the film pays an homage to not only the great city of Boston and its victims, but to law enforcement officials everywhere. It's an upsetting and uncomfortable experience but lingers with its gripping storytelling quality. It very well may be Berg's best film to date.Closer to ""United 93"" than ""World Trade Center"" in terms of high- profile national tragedies on the big screen, ""Patriots Day"" packs a wallop of emotion, bringing to light details that the average citizen may not have been aware of during the events. Berg's attention to detail, especially in the narrative cohesion and editing is the film's supreme achievement. He recreates the attacks of this harrowing chronicle in American history, utilizing existing footage, only scarcely giving us hints of Hollywood in the production. The film is much more difficult to recommend to the average movie-goer for a casual Friday date night, but it is sure to start some much needed conversations that should be happening daily about the human spirit.""Patriots Day"" is an account of Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis' actions in the events leading up to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath, which includes the city-wide manhunt to find the terrorists behind it.What Berg does extremely well is assemble a stellar ensemble cast, giving everyone their own assignment, each operating at their very best. With Mark Wahlberg in the lead role as Sgt. Tommy Saunders, he lifts the jarring presence of himself that was littered throughout ""Lone Survivor."" He manages to convey the hurt and pain of a city in one scene, and then be the beacon of hope and endurance the next. It's his best performance since his Oscar-nominated work in ""The Departed.""Co-stars Kevin Bacon and John Goodman, both grossly ignored by the Academy for their entire careers, are both champions of their craft, unrivaled by their dedication to bringing these true men to life.Playing the villain of a movie can be challenging. Playing the real- life person who committed one of the most vile acts of terrorism seen on our soil in recent memory is another hurdle on its own.Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze as as Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev deliver immaculate work that stands toe-to-toe with some of the great supporting performances of 2016. They tap not only into evil as seen by the acts of the day, but by the vanity and hatred of motivation that drove these brothers to not only act but plan to continue their reign. They're also key examples of why we are in desperate need of a casting Oscar at the moment, because the sheer imagery of them both in comparison to the real individuals is staggering.Most of the time, when critics name an MVP in a film, it goes to an actor or the director. In ""Patriots Day,"" film editors Gabriel Fleming and Colby Parker, Jr. rise to their professions with respect and excellence. Cutting together heart-stopping action sequences littered with emotionally resonate beats, the team just hits a home run. That's also thanks to the talented sound team, who partnered with Oscar-winning composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to blend the two elements beautifully.The main flaw in ""Patriots Day"" is the film not quite knowing when it has its audience. With a collage of interviews with real-life survivors following the end of the film, it makes a strange shift from narrative feature to an almost documentary-like structure that just feels misplaced.""Patriots Day"" has lots to celebrate. An unblemished ensemble, partnered with a near perfect crafts team, makes for a pure sentimental outing at the movies.GRADE: (★★★½)",Patriots Day
85,CineMuseFilms,A well-made action-packed real life disaster story overlaid with a weak 'human interest' melodrama.,7,15 February 2017,"The disaster movie is one of the oldest film genres and has a special role in public information. This is especially true in the era of global terrorism. It's a box-office judgement call how far a movie should go in embellishing the facts with dramatization rather than staying close to what really happened. The film Patriots Day (2016) made a high-risk call by creating two competing stories where one would have been more than enough.The basic facts are on the public record. On 15 April 2013 two bombs were detonated by Chechen- American brothers during the closing stages of the famous Boston Marathon. Several people were killed and hundreds were injured. A manhunt of unprecedented scale followed, the city went into lockdown, and over the next few days one brother was killed and the other captured. Woven around these facts is a thriller-drama focused on fictitious Police Sgt Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) who is assigned to patrol the race finishing-line area. Through his eyes we see the chaotic aftermath and carnage caused by the explosions. We follow the first and second wave-responders onto the scene, see the FBI take command when it is declared a terrorist attack investigation, and witness key stages in the investigation through to its climactic moments.With real-world material like this, Patriots Day should have been brilliant but it is not. The fast- moving core narrative, the archival footage, and excellent filming, editing and directing, are all the ingredients needed for a top-shelf docu-drama. Although we learn very little about the terrorists' motivations and background, the big picture is informative. However, the multiple storyline digressions into lesser melodrama dilute the film's achievements. Using a Sgt Saunders as an avatar for all emergency responders is not a bad idea, it is just that the character is poorly developed and his tantrum-prone small personality is out of place in the context of such a major disaster. There are several references to his suspension for an unspecified misdemeanour, but the director leaves it as a loose end.The narrative logic of such a strong focus on Saunders is undeveloped and there are too many melodramatic diversions. In the huge warehouse where the FBI reconstructs the crime scene, he walks the layout like a mystical wizard providing key clues that single-handedly identify the terrorists, and he just happens to be everywhere in Boston where the terrorists are fleeing. Really? Logic takes more strain when he sermonizes that the dead and injured not be called victims but peace ambassadors. It's human nature to re-define tragedy as triumph, but such shallow grandstanding casts a propaganda pall over the film.Despite its limitations, this is an important film with much to commend it. For the most part, it is a fast-paced gripping drama made more so by the knowledge that the events really happened. For audiences around the world, this film goes beyond the reported facts to provide the back story with a high level of realism. The fictionalised story is disappointing and distracting. The true story is informative and shows how quickly and compassionately real people become real heroes in the midst of tragedy. Whether the film honours heroes and victims or exploits them is your call.",Patriots Day
86,Cinemaniac1984,A gripping drama which had me glued to my seat from start to finish.,9,12 February 2017,"Patriots Day brilliantly and respectfully tells the story of the tragic Boston Marathon bombing on the fateful day of 15 April 2013 which shook the city of Boston to its core. The movie crosses between the Tsarnaev brothers who were responsible for the Boston bombing and the citywide manhunt which included the Boston Police Department, the FBI and later the Watertown Police Department.On 15 April 2013, Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) and Dzokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolff) set off two bombs at the finish line at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and severely maiming hundreds of others. The Boston Police Department and the FBI spearhead a taskforce to find the now infamous Boston bombers and bring them to justice. Amongst those that are tasked to take down the Boston bombers include Sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg), Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), and Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons). As the net closes in on the Tsarnaev brothers while the city of Boston has been shaken to its core, the brothers continue to leave a trail of destruction in their path as they attempt to evade capture.Mark Wahlberg has always been a likable actor and he does not put a foot wrong as Sergeant Tommy Saunders. Kevin Bacon, John Goodman and J.K Simmons were terrific in their respective roles. The rest of the supporting cast including Michelle Monaghan, Michael Beach, Vincent Curatola and Melissa Benoist do a fine job as well. Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze didn't have an easy job portraying the widely despised Tsarnaev brothers, but both actors should be credited with doing a terrific job.Peter Berg may have had some hits and misses as a director, but Patriot's Day is definitely one of his most memorable movies, right besides Friday Night Lights (2004), The Kingdom (2007) and Lone Survivor (2013).On a personal note, I've visited Boston in 2008 and 2014 and I've always had a memorable time visiting Boston. Even after my first visit in 2008, Boston was my favourite city that I visited while in the USA. Upon hearing about the Boston bombing in the news in 2013, my heart went out to the city and those killed and severely injured.To be perfectly honest, I thought Patriot's Day would be a run of the mill drama, however I was very surprised. With terrific direction, a powerhouse cast, and a gripping story that cuts to the chase, I was glued to my seat in the cinema from start to finish which also saw me secretly cheering for the police to take down the Boston bombers. It would not have been an easy task, but Patriot's Day did a terrific job revisiting that horrific day in 2013 which shook Boston to its core but reuniting Boston together and from that day forward, forging the slogan ""Boston Strong"". Patriot's Day is gripping viewing that is well worth watching.9/10.",Patriots Day
87,BrnzReviews,A Beautiful Adaption Of A Traumatic Event.,9,15 June 2021,"I thoroughly enjoyed this true story of the traumatic events that happened during the Boston Marathon of 0'13. This is a utterly breathtaking movie, it not only captures the heartache and terror but it also has a great cast who were able to connect with the character they're playing In the best way possible. Mark Wahlberg is great in anything he plays but this on in particular really stands out, I think the part of the story being that it happened in Boston made it easier for Wahlberg to connect to it as it clearly affected him as well.Such a great adaption to spread awareness for those we lost during this horrible events that occurred, I thought it was great how they got the details right to the point that the accuracy made it feel as if you were there.Highly recommend this, its a masterpiece that needs to be watched.",Patriots Day
88,LloydBayer,Patriots Day is a heartfelt tribute to the real life heroes of the Boston terror attacks.,7,10 January 2017,"Maybe people didn't take director Peter Berg too seriously when he made The Kingdom, a 2007 action-thriller about an Al-Qaeda attack on American expats in Riyadh. Berg's follow-up was 2013's Lone Survivor, a dramatized account of Navy SEALs being ambushed by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. Patriots Day marks the director's third film on anti-terrorism, and while the film is a raw and gruesome retelling of a tragic event, it is also a humble and heartfelt tribute to the real-life heroes portrayed in this film.Widely known for the annually held oldest marathon in the world, the city of Boston took a devastating hit on 'Patriots' Day', 15th April 2013, following coordinated attacks by home grown terrorists. Co-written by Berg, the narrative is a time-stamped account starting from the early hours of that fateful day. We see loved ones saying their goodbyes like any other day; some are runners getting ready for the marathon, while others are onlookers at the now-iconic Boylston Street. While this is happening, we are also shown the Tsarnaev brothers who would perpetrate the attacks. Revealing their identities quite early in the film is Berg's plot device to induce a foreboding sense of what is about to happen. As such, scarier than seeing them pack pressure-cooker bombs into their backpacks is the vague explanation behind the attack. We are not entirely sure if the motive is a hate crime or Jihadi influenced. Instead, Berg's focus is on the bloody and horrific aftermath of the explosions.What follows is a manhunt for the brothers even as law enforcement teams are put through the arduous task of examining tons of CCTV footage. These include Mark Wahlberg and J.K. Simmons as police officers, John Goodman as the police commissioner and Kevin Bacon representing the FBI. Though Wahlberg anchors scenes of chaos and is practically everywhere in the film, his Officer Tommy Saunders is the only character who isn't based on a real person during the marathon bombings. So why does Wahlberg play a fictional character when the film is based on an actual event? Aside from his third collaboration with the director, Wahlberg's Saunders represents a dramatized combination of the law enforcement and Boston public who responded in unity to smoke out the terrorists. The strategic placement of Boston's resilience to terror is also evident in the missing apostrophe in the title, thus making everyone involved a patriot, much like how Saunders is the everyman of Boston city.In retrospect, anyone following the news would be aware that this turned out to be the worst attack on US soil after 9/11. But unlike the islamophobia hoopla incited in The Kingdom, Berg's nuance in this film is a balanced yet vigorous retelling of a dark episode for the people of Boston. It isn't as thrilling or packed with urgency as Lone Survivor and there are also tonal shifts when a serious moment can turn unexpectedly funny. But pieced together with actual footage and images from the media and the public, Patriots Day feels more like a straightforward docudrama than mere entertainment for the masses. The solemn epilogue more than drives that message home; and along with it an emotional wallop on how tragedy can bring out the best in a community.",Patriots Day
89,EthanBJones_03,Great representation of such a tragic time; Would Recommend.,8,18 April 2017,"​Plot Overview: Set during the tragic events of the Boston Marathon Bombing, we see Tommy Saunders(Mark Walhberg), a police officer working at the finish line, struggle with his damaged knee and try to hunt down the monsters responsible before they strike again.Directed by Peter BergStarring Mark Walhberg, JK Simmons and John Goodman# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie is powerful and, from my knowledge, a very accurate representation of what happened in those tragic times. I am not American but I was still moved by the brilliant story and wowed by the fantastic acting and cinematography. I do think the movie lacks replay value but that doesn't take away from the film and make it any less enjoyable. Mark Walhberg delivers an Oscar calibre performance and I can't really flaw the supporting cast much. Even if you weren't directly involved or affected by the dark times, you will still feel affected by this movie and that is a sign of a good film.It's hard to describe the type of people who will enjoy this movie but I would imagine that possibly people who helped bring the people who committed this act to justice, fans of true stories and fans of dramas in general.Would Recommend# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Mark Walhberg delivers an Oscar calibre performance as Tommy Saunders and is up there in his repertoire. Despite this, I would have liked to see/follow a real person who was genuinely there through the story because it felt like they had to waste time making you care for the character when the character didn't really exist. JK Simmons was amazing as Police Seargent Jeffery Pugliese. John Goodman was great as Police Commissioner Ed Davis. Kevin Bacon was actually pretty good as FBI Agent Richard DesLauriers. ​ Both Alex Wolff and Themo Melikdidse were good as Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev respectively and both made me despise them so they did well. Jimmy O. Yang was pretty good as Dun Meng.The story is so emotional and heart breaking and brilliant and 100% needed to be put to the big screen. A fitting end to the Berg/Walhberg unofficial true story trilogy. The tribute at the end was beautiful and amazing. The general cinematography was really good. The use of real life footage was perfect and fitted in seamlessly with the actual film. Some scenes were poorly edited and I couldn't tell what was going on.The effects were pretty darn good. Not quite at the levels of Deepwater Horizon but still pretty good. Costume and set design was spot on.It retold the tragic story of the Boston Marathon Bombing and inspired the true nature of patriotism. There were some tonal inconsistencies which disturbed parts of the movie. It needed humour to not make the movie depressing but there are scenes that contain it that didn't need it. It felt too long. It felt like a 2hr 45min movie than a 2hr and 13min one. I think some scenes could have been removed entirely and make the film seem less long.Personally, I liked this movie but I don't see myself re-watching it as much as say, 'Deepwater Horizon. It's a powerful movie and one that I can't say I'll watch that much.8/10",Patriots Day
90,Mike_Devine,We're all 'Patriots',7,1 January 2021,"We live in an era in which every tragedy eventually ends up on film. Some situations translate better than others. In the case of the Boston Marathon bombings, the events that unfolded over the course of a harrowing week in April 2013 are actually done justice in 2016's 'Patriots Day.'The Peter Berg ""based on a very true story"" Boston drama boasts an all-star cast, from Mark Wahlberg to Kevin Bacon and John Goodman to Michelle Monaghan. But of course, the city of Boston is the true star of the show, as we're taken down to the streets to see how the FBI and BPD team up to bring down the terrorists who committed the act. As to be expected, there's plenty of confusion, sizing up and infighting to go around.'Patriots' is filmed in the signature Berg style, with lots of shaky cam and plenty of quick cuts. The events that actually transpired lend themselves well to film, from crazy car chases to cat-and-mouse pursuits. Still, it's important to remember that many lives were impacted by these terrorist acts - with some that were tragically lost - and 'Patriots' does a good job honoring them while telling this story.Sure, 'Patriots Day' is a very Boston-centric movie, but it has many of the qualities that appeal to audiences no matter where they are.",Patriots Day
91,coreyjdenford,Patriotic Hero,8,23 February 2017,"This review of Patriots Day is spoiler free**** (4/5)IF THERE IS any doubt left in this crazy world is that we already know who the hero is in this third director/star pairing. It's clear from the first few moments of the film as it was within the first few moments of Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon, it's not always clearly written in stone with film but with these two it is. Patriots Day is no exception to placing its main star Mark Wahlberg, in the fray of the dramatic premise, also after the staggering success of Berg and Wahlberg's last outings it also seems that this modern disaster masterpiece is no exception to their immense success, which - seemingly isn't going to end any time soon. Based on the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013 when millions of American were watching amateur athletes run across the city, disaster struck there were two explosions from homemade bombs made from pans, four people were killed and twelve were injured, it became known as America's biggest modern disaster since 9/11. In, Patriots Day director Peter Berg isn't afraid to go in with dramatic execution from every shot, he isn't afraid to get down and dirty through the graphic imagery though it's a little heavy handed at points the disaster is pulled off with exquisite detail. Before we get to the film's set-piece, Berg spends twenty minutes of the film meeting with its central character Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg), an everyman type police officer who's been suspended off the force due to an injury. He drinks medicinal pops and exercises daily to sustain his injury but when the moment comes he uses his strength and proves that he can be a hero even with the injury. Berg spends this time at the beginning with placing new characters, he gives them a story, the information is varied with each character but Berg makes us care for these characters with perfect clarity which are an immersive moment in a film like this. Even though Berg makes us wait for the film's stunning title-piece every moment is brilliantly played. Tension gains after it's centre point there are moments when Kevin Bacon's Richard DesLauries doesn't want to blame terrorists as he thinks there will be uproar in the news broadcasts, but when the time comes to the release of the surveillance footage, his suspects are shown as-clear-as-day. There are times when Tommy is persistently strong-willed, even when he suffers from PTSD which his wife (Monaghan) suggests as he can't get the gruesome images out of his head, yet, he is still willing to get extra evidence, from asking survivors about their reports of the event. The police and first responders spend days settling the investigation to find the suspects, it's here when Berg finds a new focus, this is a moment when the film becomes a little slow, it loses momentum when we spend a huge amount of time with this focus - perhaps an untimely place for the film to be stuck in but it's still impressive. There is a car chase, a gun fight and many explosions; though it begins to follow the same aspects as a Bourne movie, with some Paul Greengrass-esque camera shaking but it still manages to stay respectful to the real-life disaster. There are other slow moments, heading towards the third act, but it always feels relevant to the key aspects of the story. As the investigation comes to an end the film keeps its steady pace, after the loss of tension. Towards the film's denouement, it's not just about the set-piece or the action, there are moments of well-earned sentimentality, too, as the characters that we met towards the film's start have their chance to play their part, in timely video reports. Patriots Day is an excellent paean of a modern-day disaster biopic which feels relevant today; it doesn't feel like it's too soon after the event. Though at times, the film is slow, and is heavy-handed but each moment is brilliantly executed with immense detail, it's a tense story that stays respectful to the event and the ordeal of the police justice system. VERDICT: Berg and Wahlberg strike again with another epic action packed modern disaster masterpiece with phenomenal performances and edge of your seat adrenaline, Patriots Day is as good as heroism gets.",Patriots Day
92,kgprophet,Tolerance is Patriotic,6,29 March 2017,"What does it say about this film that went from possible Oscar contender to box office flop? Or perhaps, the question is, what does it say about us? I did not have any interest to see ""World Trade Center"" when it was released. To a degree, I felt this was making money off of tragedy. Maybe too soon after the event. I also didn't care to have the entertainment options now being guided by terrorists. We can certainly expect after a high profile tragedy; the special news show, the books, and then the movie. I was open to checking this film out because I was willing to see the director's depiction of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. That film made for an all-out thriller action flick, but yet was able to stay within the boundaries of realism. Now after seeing Patriot's Day, I think director Peter Berg might be trying to imitate Michael Bay with a thousand camera angles and slick editing. It also tries to be a little too convenient by giving our leading man a chance to yuck things up while being at the right place at the right time to save the day. Then there is a strange scene where Mark Wahlberg suddenly becomes psychic and knows which shops the terror suspect walked into. Wahlberg is conveniently placed in the middle of all the major events that were part of this incident. This is done for convenience, but that ultimately does disservice to the factual basis of the story. I did enjoy the energetic pace of the story, both in the build-up and manhunt afterward. Little time is spent setting up the two brothers who instigated the bombing, other than older brother was the more radicalised of the two. Was Wahlberg's character either an amalgam of other characters or just good ole' ""say hi to your ma"" Marky Mark? Either way, his inclusion in this whole incident was like Kevin Costner becoming the main character during the Cuban Missile Crisis (according to ""Thirteen Days""). As for the supporting characters, they don't ever get to say much. Too bad John Goodman's Boston accent is atrocious. Kevin Bacon fits well into his role. Screen time is given to the victims, including before the incident. These scenes thankfully are not used for foreshadowing, and actually do a good job of humanising them. The theme of this movie is camaraderie. There is only a little bickering about the direction of the investigation, and in the process portrays the City of Boston as a fist- pumping patriotic love fest. I felt the manipulative music was deliberately used to push the sentimentality. There is an epilogue that runs too long that tries too hard to squeeze tears out of the audience. I think there could have been a more documentary approach to this sequence, and not use the music as a shameless attempt to push our buttons. This film received very favourable reviews, and perhaps some critics felt trapped in recommending it because of the sensitive nature of the film. Giving this movie a negative review could be seen as a slight on the victims, etc. I compare this movie to the excellent ""United 93"", which chose to use no music, and did not have a fictional charismatic lead guy be the narrative thread. ""United 93"" chose realism over sentimentality and still was a riveting human drama. I must say I agree with the extra message at the end of the film that WE ARE STILL A NATION OF TOLERANCE, and was the responsible thing for the filmmakers to make sure those who watch understand the importance of that message in our current political climate. I ultimately decided to wait until the DVD came out. The longer running time and mixing of fiction with fact in the narrative was tolerable, but also made me not regret seeing it sooner. I believe this film will stand the test of time, so it's worth a look.",Patriots Day
93,Ramascreen,"Vigorous, powerful, and deeply moving",10,20 December 2016,"#PatriotsDayMovie is a perfectly accurate depiction of one of the most harrowing and courageous weeks in U.S. history. Everybody involved in this movie has done the true story and the survivors justice, they approach it with immense respect so much so that the result is a vigorous, powerful, and deeply moving film that's part procedural part thriller with all around great performances.Scripted by Peter Berg, Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer, directed by Peter Berg, the story focuses on the Boston marathon bombing attack in spring 2013 and the aftermath of that unspeakable tragedy. Mark Wahlberg plays police sergeant Tommy Saunders who joins the first responders and investigators in a race against the clock to hunt down the people responsible. Kevin Bacon plays special agent Richard Deslauriers, John Goodman plays commissioner Ed Davis, J.K. Simmons plays Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, and Michelle Monaghan plays nurse Carol Saunders. The film also celebrates community's courage in the face of adversity.There are many aspects that I'm sure Peter Berg had to take into consideration in the process of making this film, there are several fine lines, questions of how to make this sensitive towards the families of the victims, how to make sure that the film doesn't come across as just being action, and how to make sure they tell the story in way that emphasizes what tragedies like this often does which is bring people together. And so I think PATRIOTS DAY is a testament to Peter Berg's strength as a storyteller. The whole thing is staged in such way that immediately takes us back to how it happened three years ago, no sugarcoating, no dumbing down, it even amplifies that unfiltered Boston attitude to the degree which I haven't seen before in any other film, and the addition that they do have, in the case of Mark Wahlberg's character, is there as the voice that conveys the film's message, what it exemplifies.The film at times goes into investigative mode, so it gets riveting, which I think is important because the collaboration and the conflict and the banter between law enforcement agencies did play an integral role on how the event ultimately concluded. Kudos to all the actors involved, especially Themo Melikidze and Alex Wolff who have the heavy burden of portraying the murderers. Themo and Alex essentially become the Tsarnaev brothers and they manage to evoke all kinds emotions in the audience anytime they show up on the screen. I think it's a wise decision on Berg's part to incorporate raw footage from the many of the video surveillance cameras because they only add to the narrative's intensity. ""Patriots Day"" is not a re-enactment, it's a depiction with an ever present theme of what we as human beings or citizens can accomplish if we would just set our differences aside and help one another.",Patriots Day
94,gavinp9,Well-made and touching true story,8,2 January 2018,"'Patriots Day' is another ""based-on-real-events"" film by Berg, after 'Lone Survivor' and 'Deepwater Horizon' - and this is just as good. I think once he got 'Battleship' out of his system, he's only got good directing left! He takes his time introducing a set of ~10 characters in the first 20min (no titles), in the lead up to and the start of the 2013 Boston Marathon. Tommy (Wahlberg) is the everyman cop, Carol (Monaghan) is his wife, Ed (Goodman) is the police commissioner, DesLauriers (Bacon) is the FBI agent, Tamerlan (Melikidze) and Dzhokhar (Wolff) are the bombers, and there's a few other 'regular' couples introduced, so we get coverage of the incident from various angles.Once the bombs go off, it's utter chaos and is shown very realistically - heart-wrenchingly so - with plenty of smoke, blood, sirens and people screaming everywhere. Tommy does the best he can, but it's good to see him exhausted and overwhelmed once he's back home with Carol. We see firsthand some of the victims in hospital - plenty of amputations. Then, it turns to police/FBI efficiency, with a ""hours since bombing"" graphic letting us know the timeline, as they try to catch the suspects. This man-hunt aspect of the film keeps the momentum up.Some of the characters we've been following that seem to have no role are suddenly involved (i.e. Sergeant Pugliese (Simmons) and Meng (Yang)) as the man-hunt escalates into a shootout. I'm not entirely sure of the actual events that happened after the marathon bombing, so I'm not sure how much creative license was taken by Berg, but there's a satisfactory conclusion. The film wraps up with the real-life people of the characters we've been watching speaking on the impact it's had on their lives. There's some truly emotional and touching moments throughout the film, and while it's sometimes too overtly patriotic, it shows the impact on real people and their resilience.",Patriots Day
95,ragingbull_2005,Berg's Best,8,8 February 2017,"Wahlberg and Berg worked on two movies in 2016, both of which were based on real life tragedies. The first one, Deepwater Horizon, was about an offshore rig, which exploded and created the worst oil spill in U.S. history. #PatriotsDayMovie is about the bombings that happened during the Boston marathon and the subsequent manhunt for the perpetrators. For me, this is Berg's most gripping movie, surpassing the absolutely riveting Lone Survivor, based on Marcus Luttrell's eponymous book about a team of special commandos who get trapped in Afghanistan. Berg doesn't get into sermonizing or demonizing any community. The urban warfare is chilling & visceral. He keeps the focus razor sharp, on the tragic tale and keeps the thrills coming, one after the other. As he did in Deepwater Horizon, Wahlberg seems content on playing the second fiddle to the screenplay. The first scene of the film that shows Wahlberg hurting his leg while trying to barge the door open, sets the mood for the rest of the story. So, there is barely an action sequence where Wahlberg steals the limelight. There seems to be no ""creative liberty"" taken or facts twisted to portray Wahlberg as the ""superhero"", which is all the more creditable, considering the fact that Wahlberg has produced both this and Deepwater. The Academy has nominated the crappy ""Lion"" in six different categories, including Best Movie and Direction, which is a bloody shame. #PatriotsDayMovie had a rightful claim, in front of the shambolic fare that is Lion. However, thrillers have generally gotten the short end of the stick. And, in these times of Trump, to nominate a movie that tells the true tale of two immigrants who brought a city to a complete halt, wouldn't have made political sense.",Patriots Day

I was wrong. I can't speak to just how accurate it was but they did use a lot of tv and cctv footage of the real bombers in the movie. I looked up some of the details after and it all checked out, mostly about the police confrontation at one point.Mark Wahlberg shows his acting chops in this movie. He had me feeling empathy for what those people and first responders must have been feeling. I am not a US citizen but even I was feeling pride in the strength shown by everyone.I will say this, this movie is graphic it shows the aftermath of the bombing. Lots of injuries etc they don't show it but a little boy died in the bombing so if you are sensitive to stuff like this and knowing this is what really happened it might be a bit much for some folks to handle. Having said that I would recommend this to anyone who wants an excellent drama with intense action movie.",Patriots Day
97,kaptenvideo-89875,"It's us versus them, and the big boys are coming!",7,9 January 2017,"2013's the Boston Marathon Bombing the Hollywood version. First responders and investigators are racing against the clock to hunt down the sneaky Muslim bombers before they strike again. It can't be watchable to anyone but American patriots, right?Wrong. ""Patriots Day"" is actually a solid action thriller which seems realistic enough, even handling some more trivial details like how the bombers look like exactly. It avoids the excessive corniness and epic-ness till the last minutes and plays it like a catastrophe movie followed by exciting manhunt. The cameras are out there with us, in the middle of it all, and it still looks good. Another good example of how to handle the shaky in-your-face style of action that is often strongly disliked or even hated in movies.The stories of the main characters are rather vague and shallow, so good that they are relegated to sidelines. Mark Wahlberg has one of the biggest roles and does his usual thing which seems really pretty interesting only for the maybe first three times you see him in movies.You know, that humble and tender joe everyman that has a big heart but also gets sh*t done where it really matters. Like a action version of Adam Sandler or something.There are some big boyz of Hollywood involved, to make the movie more solid and prestigious, including John Goodman, Kevin Bacon and underused J. K. Simmons. It's amazing how effective this kind of playaz can be to bring almost any story to life. They make serious faces, talk their serious talk and make the world a better place. Works every time. ""Patriots Day"" is a tight enough package already... and they make it even more watch-worthy. Seriously.Boston Marathon bombing is good basis for a Hollywood movie. It's recent and true-life, so it can turn populist without getting too much criticism for it, and there's also creative freedom to add pretty much anything you want to a story.So no wonder there are more movies on the horizon. ""Stronger"" with Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead is coming already, and there's also some project called Boston Stronger""...All in all, this is certainly by far the most fun I've had watching a movie directed by Peter Berg. He's always good with action and usually boring handling everything else (""The Kingdom"", ""Battleship"", ""Hancock"", ""Lone Survivor"" and ""Deepwater Horizon"", among others).",Patriots Day
98,jb_campo,Reliable documentary,6,7 May 2017,"I live in the Boston area and remember well the bombing event. This film accurately depicts the terrible incidents that shook Boston during the 2013 Boston Marathon.It was very interesting to learn more details about how the attack was handled from the inside and the challenges they faced. Mark Wahlberg as Tommy Saunders was introduced into the story to pull together all the different pieces of the story. Otherwise, the other characters are all real.As others have noted, it does get a bit tiring, and hard to believe, that Saunders is here, he's there, he's everywhere. This impacted the story to make it seem more about Saunders than about the battle to find the two bombers. The movie also failed to realistically build up the tension that the people felt as the city was being ripped apart by the search for these murderers. Then things started happening very quickly, and huge tensions got yet worse. Yet, the film failed to depict that. yes, the city was closed, but what were people feeling? Certainly more could have been done to depict that fear.In summary, accurate depiction, decent acting, but just an average documentary that could have been better. Enjoy.",Patriots Day
99,trublu215,"Thrilling, Gut Wrenching, and Absolutely Stunning",10,7 December 2016,"Patriots Day is a somber film, one that is soaked in contempt for its depiction and skepticism for its accuracy of the events that transpired on April 15, 2013 at the Boston Marathon and then the subsequent events that followed. Well, I can assure those of you who are feeling negative emotions over this, Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have created, not only a great film but a respectable one. There are no ""lone hero"" moments for those of you who see Wahlberg's name in the same sentence as the term Boston Bombing movie and think it will be a balls out action film. Trust me, it is not. It is so far removed from that notion that it made me like the film even more. Despite Wahlberg's character being fictitious, it still holds a great deal of reality to it all.The film starts off with immediately. There is no sort of fluff to this film, it starts off trying to be as realistic as possible and it achieves this ten fold. It starts on the morning of April 15, 2013 as a beautiful day. Throughout the course of the marathon, we're introduced to a plethora of characters ranging from John Goodman's Ed Davis to Kevin Bacon's Richard DesLauris. Once the film is done getting us acclimated to these people...it happens and when it happens, it is horrifying. The explosion is LOUD. There is no lead up to it, it felt like it did in real life, it's a shock. From this moment on, Patriots Day kicks into a high-octane race against time thriller more in the vein of Zero Dark Thirty.The film itself is Peter Berg's masterpiece. It is every bit as thrilling and gut-wrenching as it is heartbreaking yet uplifting simultaneously. There is a clear cut love for this film by its maker and it absolutely pays off. The drama is every bit as riveting as the brutal action sequences (especially the final confrontation). This is Berg at his best. He does an amazing job here with both directing and writing and I don't think it will go unnoticed. The score is the other half to this film. Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor do amazing work here in this and it was really cool to see a film that suited their talents as well as this film did.The acting is absolutely excellent. Mark Wahlberg gives his absolute all in this role. The rage he feels in frame is real, the tears he cries in frame are real and the anger he feels in this is most certainly real. I think it might just be his best performance. J.K. Simmons is another phenomenal actor in this film that gives a perfect performance as Jeffrey Pugliese. To sum it up as best I can, the acting is top-notch and I'd be very surprised if the film didn't garner a couple acting nominations at this point but only time can tell.Overall, Patriots Day is every bit as thrilling as its true story. It will have you crying, gasping for air, gripping your arm rest and sometimes all at once. Peter Berg delivers an excellent film with Mark Wahlberg giving the most honest performance of his career. I highly recommend it.",Patriots Day
100,doorsscorpywag,Spoilt by Tommy Saunders,5,12 January 2017,A very well done film about the events. The ending was the most effective part as the victims and some of the heroes got their voice. The idea by some here that because only 3 people died it was unworthy of having a film made about it is silly. I am English and we know plenty about bombings here as we had the IRA for 30 years funded by places such as Boston. But we here have empathy with Boston as we do with dozens of places around the world that suffered like they did. 3 or 3000 it's all the same just the numbers are different. It's still a tragedy for those affected by the events.But inserting a fictional cop into the events was frankly an insult to those who were really there.Mark Wahlberg as the ridiculous Tommy Saunders stank the movie out. Foul mouthed and abusive towards the FBI it seemed as if the investigation would have faltered if not for him. This fool was in every important event in the movie. At one point I was expecting him to storm the boat single handed.Surely they could have told the same story using the people who actually did these things instead of him grabbing their plaudits and being congratulated during and after for being the most hard working cop in Boston.It spoilt a worthy movie. His character was detrimental to the film and his acting performance really annoying. The movie itself was very good when Wahlberg was not in it and the acting by the rest of the cast was good.But overall it was spoilt by the casting of Wahlberg and his character Tommy Saunders.,Patriots Day
101,darkreignn,One of the best cinema experiences in years,7,13 January 2017,"If you're craving to feel the pain and sorrow of a national tragedy without actually experiencing it firsthand, then this is the movie for you. ""Patriots Day"" in an exhaustingly emotional ride that will leave you feeling numb, but at least Mark Wahlberg is there to help you through it, holding your hand every step of the way.In all seriousness, ""Patriots Day"" is pretty good film. It handles the real-life events with delicacy, without glamorizing or sensationalizing the violence, and it never once felt like a product that was made to capitalize on an act of terrorism. It is a thoughtful and intense journey into the lives of so many different people, both good and evil, and it is constantly engaging and exciting, showing how sometimes good can overcome bad, no matter how overwhelming it can seem.Mark Wahlberg gives a fantastic performance, but I would in no way classify him as the main character of the film. Sure, he's in every trailer and poster, but he is not shown in every scene in the film, and in fact, there is a fifteen to twenty minute stretch where he is not shown at all. Instead of showing Mark Wahlberg as the all-American hero, something that everyone thought was going to happen, the film shows him as just another person caught up in these horrific, unimaginable events, and it is quite effective. There is a scene in the movie where, after the explosion takes place, Mark Wahlberg goes home to his wife and finds his house full of people. He screams at them and tells them to get out of his house, and then he sits on the couch with is wife. His eyes fill with tears. He cries. He explains how he doesn't even understand what he saw at the explosion sight, how there was so much blood, how the images in his head are never going away. His wife holds his hand and tries to fight back tears, and while she was mildly successful, myself and the rest of my theatre were most definitely not, as this scene was, no doubt, one of the most heartfelt and emotional scenes shown in a film released in 2016. And you may say the point of this scene was to get the audience to cry, but I disagree; the point of this scene was to show a confused and shattered man trying to cope in the aftermath of something that no one ever expected or thought would ever happen, and I'll be damned if it wasn't incredibly effective. Another thing that this film does well is show how so many different people from different backgrounds were caught up in this living Hell. A student from China, a husband and wife, a man and his son, and so many others, all of their lives were intertwined because of this event, and all of them had their own part to play. And let me just comment, there are scenes with the student from China that are probably the most intense and nail-biting cinema experiences I've had in years.The music in this film is a mixed bag, however. On one hand, there are some points in this film where the soundtrack really enhances the intensity, and one point in particular that, when the soundtrack kicked in, had me on the edge of my seat, literally breathing deeply to avoid having an asthma attack in the theatre from the amount of suspense I was feeling. On the other hand, sometimes the music in the movie is incredibly noticeable, and not in an organic way. There are sequences in the film where a constant droning can be heard for long stretches at a time, and the droning goes on for so long that it is really distracting and takes away from what is actually happening on screen. But, towards the second half of the movie the soundtrack kicks into high gear, and it really meshes well with the events that are being shown.Another thing that I loved about this movie was the cinematography. Instead of looking overly stylized, like ""Watchmen,"" or overly fake and glamorized, like ""Unbroken,"" this movie just looks real. It honestly feels like watching a documentary of these events because the camera work is just so slick and high-definition, and it doesn't look like any sort of filter was used in postproduction. I really can't get over how good this movie looked, and I think the word ""clean"" would be the best word used to describe it. It was just so refreshing to see a movie with camera-work and cinematography that looked so fantastic, and if you decide to see the film, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.""Patriots Day"" is, in my opinion, an important movie. It shows people that things like the events portrayed in this movie could, and do, happen. It shows how some people are truly soulless, without care for the lives of others. But most importantly, it shows how, in a time of crisis, people can work together to help, to rebuild, and to protect. Make ""Patriots Day"" the next movie you go see at the cinema; you will not regret it.",Patriots Day
102,SyoKennex,A piece of art to go down in history,10,29 April 2017,"This is a film for ages to come. Never before have I been so taken aback by a movie.On April 15, 2013 Boston, Massachusetts, Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders is pulling security duty on the annual Boston Marathon when the Tsarnaev brothers strike with their homemade bombs in an act of terrorism. In the resulting chaos as the wounded are cared for, Saunders and his comrades join forces with the FBI to get to the bottom of this attack. As the investigation continues, the Tsarnaev brothers realise that the authorities are close to identifying them and attempt to flee the city to continue their fanatical mayhem. To stop them, a police manhunt is performed that would have bloody confrontations and a massive dragnet shutting down the City of Boston to make sure there is no escape from the law. We all had our questions when this happened, and became a world wide piece of news. We were all staring at our television sets in shock, trying to figure out what had happened. Where those injured getting the correct care? Were the fatality numbers going up? Have they caught those that caused this terrorist attack yet?This film brings all of those questions we had into one piece of media. We follow the bombings, with real life footage of the bombs going off back in 2013. It shows us real life photos of the original bombers, and the accurate representation of what the FBI did to work with the police and do their investigation. This movie had me on the edge of my seat for nearly the whole two hours. There was such raw emotion in this, I found myself crying countless times. The work put into this, the acting, everything was absolutely amazing. I'm giving everyone a solid ten out of ten for the acting they did in this. It was absolutely spectacular. Never before have I seen a more emotional performance than the actors in this movie. I was warmed by the amount of love shown in this movie, and it warmed my heart even more to know that this was how the Americans actually reacted when the bombs went off. Truly, seeing how much love and care everyone held during these events really rekindled my hope for humanity. Mark Wahlberg put on the performance of a lifetime, I've never been more amazed by his acting. He deserved so many awards for this.This is an absolute work of art and this is one of those movies that really needs to be kept in the film archives for years. I will definitely be watching this numerous times this year. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.",Patriots Day
103,FallenEye,Raw War.,7,10 September 2017,"Patriots Day, though a good movie, somehow felt like it would've been better suited as a documentary, perhaps because it was shot like one, because really a documentary can be made into a movie and vice versa.This film was good all around, nothing about it was defective really. The acting and the directing was satisfactory. I find it quite surprising actually that it didn't do well at the box office... Perhaps it was too soon, and many saw it as exploitative?Also, how is it that the Dzhokhar's friends were/are arrested for obstructing justice, yet Tamerlan's wife isn't? Whatever evidence they have against the friends, it was explained in the movie that they had even more against the wife, and maybe it was circumstantial, but, how is it any different to the evidence the cops had on the friends? Unless maybe they're trying to build a case stronger than just obstruction?Lastly, how do we approach the conundrum of the ""media"", being this film, having a character who says that we're conditioned by the media to believe that 9/11 was a terrorist attack, via the very media he says is conditioning us? By accepting his media argument, we then can't believe him, but by rejecting it, we're proving his theory right. I mention this because Patriots Day is a bio, and there really still is a huge question mark around the events of September 11th.Anyway, again, Patriots Day was a good movie, and I also wonder if that friendly fire bit actually happened, because whoa; that was close. 7/10.",Patriots Day
104,FelipeCarrillo,"""Patriots Day"" Honors the Heroes of Its Title",5,22 July 2017,"Peter Berg, a man of tragically flag-waving predilections, finishes the calamitous triplet led by his Hollywood star-fetish Mark Wahlberg, which was inaugurated with 2013's ""Lone Survivor"" and resumed only a few years later with the frenetic ""Deepwater Horizon"", a movie nominated for an Academy Award for its technical constituents. So the feature film that concludes, apparently, that directional volition about dramatizing the confrontation between a daring and patriotic paladin against a painful misfortune is ironically ""Patriots Day"", a work with ambiguous messages and diverted pretensions taking back in time the unity and tenacity feeling that arose on April 15, 2013 by a long-runtime thriller docudrama with a rather slow pace, which doesn't use all its options due to a arrhythmic editing work, an un- strategic directional style and an unglued narrative thread, at least, with regard to the babel of supporting characters and formulaic flaws, taking into account the previous works of this patriotic and concise filmmaker.Boston, main actor's city of origin concomitantly, has managed to recompose from a pair of blows which collapsed a stable community, some upright civilians and in generic terms, the American tranquility in its full extent. The terrorist attack, perpetrated by a Kyrgyz and a Soviet, which shook the annual and traditional Boston Marathon, on April 15, 2013, near the finish line. Is there any bait more customary-crowded by the fervent patriotic sense-than an American athletic competition to congregate an immense deluge of pale faces around two explosions inspired by the animadversion-blasts? In this episode that left traces on the skin of the people from Boston is placed the story of Berg and Wahlberg, however, the leading actor in the story is the only apocryphal character (inspired by several officers who participated in the rescues) within all that sea of realities. Tommy Saunders is a dipsomaniac sergeant, who to be active again in the assignment of true significance cases, he must be responsible for guarding the most important athletic event for his people, with not only a bruised knee, also his ego.Despite the diminished expertise, the director understands in advance what he wants and what utensils are essential to carry out his task: pay homage the brave men with an impressive wisdom, which helped them to not lose their sanity in the midst of such a maelstrom of madness. Appreciable is the dedicated approach to the supporting characters, showing a heteroclite and coarse caution with respect to the exposition and corresponding ephemeris of those affected people by the terrorist attack, affected people with an introduction and conclusion as constrained as unsatisfactory. On the other side of the coin are the saviors, the main heroes of the odyssey led by Wahlberg, actor who has woven a consistent work camaraderie with Berg because of the services provided and whose best executed performance in the film triplet is achieved here, considering the overacting anti-terrorism message unsuitable basic and tacky that manifests the aberrant skills of the screenwriters for incorporating a required hopeful and educational lesson, an actor who continues his acting journey towards Ithaca, that symbolizes the property that only experience can confer: the apprehension that less is more, sometimes. Together with him are veracious titans in the field ranging from J. K. Simmons to Kevin Bacon, from Michelle Monaghan to John Goodman, some actors impersonating researchers, others in roles of interviewer, keeping as a common factor the need to pay tribute to the true heroes. The script, which is riddled with possibilities, only manages to bring out a couple of them, leaving up in the air the potential of other conceptions that, with a different polishing, would have made the pleasures of the fussiest moviegoers. It's made up of a mosaic of ideas from three screenwriters that, most of the time, doesn't conclude on anything really optimized. The film expels core proposals that end up on the scrap heap due to they don't have a sense of direction.As for the recreation of the events, which was one of the most attractive and magnetic points for the audience, they decently built the calamity and agony witnessed a few years ago. Opting for gunfights and chases executed with hand-held camera techniques, these result in an untidiness becoming disappointing, the fluctuation of the cameraman can be palpable in some shots, softening the meager beauty in the midst of so much human monstrosity. However, there are fantastic scenes such as the moment after the explosion from a high- angle shot where the cloud of smoke emerging from the homemade bomb allows to glimpse the victims plummeting or kneeling in the roughness of the asphalt, a beautiful and mournful lament at the same time, nevertheless, panoramas like these are counted on the fingers of one hand.Peter Berg fulfills his concern: to pay homage, full stop. It won't become a pressing classic about either American tragedies nor about the battle of a man for saving his people, and perhaps, it gonna has no place in the avalanche of upcoming awards, but what matters here is the goal of the director: to honor those who were genuinely in the claws of smoke, fire, and turmoil. FBI agent, spectator, runner, Yankee, Latin American, of the yellow race, child, adult, needy, wealthy, clumsy, intellectual: human, everything is condensed in that, we're all human and we have to support ourselves in the time of cholera, in order to preserve our species. Ultimately, that's the moral message of the movie, and although this aura failed to encompass the event in its entirety, at least managed to communicate what generated the tragedy, which, by the misfortune of the attackers, had counterproductive sequels due to the bombs didn't divide us, these ones unified us.",Patriots Day
105,PetarNeo,Boston in love,8,16 March 2017,"Peter Berg, the director of Deepwater horizon which was a incredible story and very nicely looking movie gets us another moving, emotionally wrecking and violent movie. This wild heart-wrenching picture brings us the worst in humans and also the best giving us the sense of scare and pain but also love and unity. Portraying the terrorist attack that happened in 2013 at Boston in way how it shaped humans and had it's impact on everyone included inside that was quite fascinating. Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) is a Boston Sergeant that keeps pushing in pursuit for attackers and giving us a very emotional performance as well as putting his head to risk to protect everyone in his act of love and kindness was pretty to watch. Loving wife of his Carol Saunders (Michelle Monaghan) and her love for Tommy and support that offers him in doing such hard job. Giving us insight into actions of Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolff) and their cruelty that they brought to more then 250 people that were struck by vile incident was painful. Ed Davis (John Goodman) was a tough and determined in catching people responsible and Goodman gives strength to his character in misery that he feels as city is being shut down. Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang) a man that was face to face and felt biggest fear, fear of death and in his ability to escape and in his braveness came outcome of fast finding two bombers. There is also many many characters that were close to all but somewhat they felt just like they needed to fill some space in the movie and didn't get the chance to prove itself. Such as JK Simmons as Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese and in his calmness but also will to fight, Kevin Bacon as Richard DesLauriers ,a special FBI agent and his thoughts about situation. There is also a discussion that could be arranged around pointing Muslims as bad and Americans as innocent but that theme should be left to others as movie makers try to give us their best vision of story and Peter Berg gives us one that is pretty hard and bloody. It tries to give us reason to love despite everything that happens to us but at the same time to fight it with love. And all we need is Love. 3/4",Patriots Day
106,heisenberg12,"A Mixed Bag- Entertaining and Compelling, but Disappoints Overall",6,14 January 2017,"This movie comes out at awards season as an apparent surprise contender for the Oscars. It certainly had the source material and some substance to work with. So I went in hoping to be a believer. This is a movie that gets mixed reviews: it's both good and bad.The good is the fine direction and staging of the events that occurred. They were done with keen attention to detail and impressive accuracy to how the events transpired. Therefore, it makes for an effective action movie and thriller. The first hour of the movie is very good; one of the best first halves of any movie I've witnessed this year. It also does an effective job holding your attention, building suspense, and feeling for the unfortunate victims of the tragedy and carnage that occurred. But the film falls short of greatness and even short of being anything special for the genre, a genre that most recently includes much better films like Zero Dark Thirty. These are basically recent manhunt movies for terrorists in events that only took place within three to five years ago before their release. Other examples are United 93 and to some extent, World Trade Center. So don't go in expecting a masterpiece or anything mind blowing. However, it is a decent movie. It does many things right but also many wrong. While it was nice to acknowledge the pride for the Boston PD and LE heroes involved in succeeding in solving the case, that alone isn't enough to make a movie great, obviously due to technicalities and all the other filmmaking aspects. Wahlberg, while a likable guy trying his best, sort of was a distraction and not well cast as an imaginary Boston cop who was there that day and helped investigate the case. He's ""okay"" in the role, but a better character actor wouldn't have been as much of a distraction and probably more believable. Then there's the long drawn out real life interviews at the end. There's a few movies with these this year, but they only show a handful of real life clips or summaries of ""what happened to..."". This one has several minutes of real life interviews and interviewees, from survivors to police officers to politicians and others involved, and it's just all over the place. It came off as amateur overall even though it was nice to hear from the survivors. It was just way too long and awkward for a feature film. Last but not least, while realism was one of the film's biggest strengths as far as how events happened and their staging, including accurate depictions and casting for the Tsarnaev brothers and streets of Watertown the final showdown took place, I was hoping that if they went as far as to create a fictitious character in Wahlberg that they also might be bold and daring enough to tie in an alternative ending for Tamerlan; on the night it happened, live news video showed a naked handcuffed young man being escorted by LE and the reporter claimed that was the suspect and he was in custody (you can even look it up on YouTube- it looks identical to him), and an outside observer can put 2 and 2 together and at least picture and theorize that the PD killed him. Instead, they went with the recorded story that Dzokhar, his brother, ran him over. Of course it would have been controversial and might have led to possible backlash from many arenas, but that would have been compelling. Like I said, if they're going to make up a main character, why not add a surprise twist that may have very well happened according to video footage of the news to people who watched that night. Instead, it came off just a tad predictable. Overall, though, it was a pretty good movie.6/10",Patriots Day
107,TuesdayThe17th,Peter Berg's epic finale,10,4 January 2021,"The last, the darkest, and best film of Peter Berg's ""based on true events trilogy"" is what is ""Patriots Day"". Released in 2016, the same year as his film ""Deepwater Horizon, and three years after ""Lone Survivor"", Peter Berg has proved himself as a no nonsense filmmaker. All three films in this trilogy are rated 7.1 or higher on imdb and are actually really good and accurate portrayals of real and devastating events. Berg has a talent for these types of films and i hope he does another one of these types of movies again soon. ""Spencer Confidential"" felt like a joke compared to these movies. The acting in ""Patriots Dsy"" is phenomenal from everyone involved. Mark Wahlberg gives a career best performance and even though he doesn't get as much screen time as i had hoped, the movie is very even with its characters and it all comes full circle in the end, allowing each character to be a hero in their own way. Alex Wolff is also great here as this is one of his first films. This is the movie that helped him get noticed. This is an important movie to see, so go see it now",Patriots Day
108,ctowyi,Respectful and powerful dramatisation,8,18 January 2017,"Peter Berg has always been an iffy scattered genre director - he can churn out popcorn throwaway entertainers like Battleship (2012) and The Rundown (2003), wayward routine action-ers like Hancock (2008) and The Kingdom (2007), but his last two movies Lone Survivor (2013) and Deepwater Horizon (2016) have seen him delve into fact-based stories of heroism. Through his last two films, one can easily notice Berg honing his skills and with Patriots Day he has gotten it right. The learning curve is evident in that he has learned to dial down that American #1 jingoistic histrionics and is finally able to achieve the fine balance between connecting with the audience on a deeper level and succeeding as pure adrenaline entertainment. Patriots Day deconstructs the events of the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013 and the ensuing manhunt for the terrorists in a stone-cold adrenaline pumping fashion. The docudrama opens with an unrelated problematic arrest in which Saunders busts his knee and we get a quick introduction of our titular salt-of-the-earth fictional cop and we see the initial traumatic events through his eyes. We are quickly and efficiently given introductions to all the important players and the peripheral ones, including the terrorists that will feature in the story. All in all we are just given enough to show us that everyone has something to live for., nothing feels jackhammered into our brains. The opening act is one crisply edited and vividly crafted segment of economical story construction. After the explosions, the movie wastes no time in moving into police procedural trajectory and this is when it hits heart-parked-in-your-mouth territory. There are so many scenes that are gems here - Saunders walking a reconstruction of the crime scene, an escape from a car-jacking, a spine-chilling interrogation, the gun-fight showdown at a residential street. Berg never glamourises any party and simply lays out the facts in linear form with time stamps. The movie recreates the events faithfully with the cloying melodrama wisely dialled down and the light never fails to shine down on the people of Boston, the real heroes of the tragedy. Throughout the movie, it remains respectful to the victims and the law enforcement agencies involved and celebrates their consummated efforts in apprehending the terrorists. Berg never presses the exploitative button and that immediately makes the movie memorable. Every individual feels like real human beings with authentic sensitivities and moral stakes. He has found his niche and he is revelling in a genre that seldom offers surprises and few have done as well.",Patriots Day
109,Padreviews,5/10 People's day - it's about human loss,5,1 March 2017,"It's a film about people not a film about patriotism. There was nothing patriotic about what the two brothers did on that day , all they did was to fuel the fire of hatred against innocent muslims and give unnecessary credence to the likes of Donald Trump . It's a sad film from so many angles , unusually it was in sequence and the elongated ending with the almost obligatory interviews with actual victims just made it feel like a documentary . Sully handled this part so much better . It's really hard to see what this film was trying to say because It really said nothing . There was very little emotional connection to the characters. This type of film should have you in tears , the only emotional moments were the Chinese man talking to mark walrberg after he escapes . Plus the man finding his 3 year old at hospital . On the positive side there was a lot of focus on those who were injured and lost limbs which will strike a chord with the victims of the tragedy on 7/7 in London . The awful thing about the actual event was that it was somewhat prophecised in the film Four Lions . But no matter how much the authorities try to protect us one will always get through . The police and FBI follow up work was exceptional in capturing the perpetrators. Kevin Bacon was brilliant great stage presence . The title of the film feels insensitive , normally films have more than one title . It would have been far better to use a different title in the UK after all if we are supposed to hate the bad guys then why have a title that commemorates terrorism , after all the American revolution might be something in America that appears patriotic but not in the U.K. Those who have read history will know it as an act of terrorism , then there's the location - the tea party , Noraid in the 20th century supporting terrorism . So if you want the audience to feel alienated you did a good job with the insensitivity . But the film is about people we in the west are so lucky that such awful events are rare whereas in Iraq they have to deal with the death of 100 people a week through such acts , so they must view the film about the death of three people as over the top by comparison , lord knows how many Americans died on 15/4/13 from the guns of other Americans , i'm sure it's more than three, so this film feels political and the timing of it release with #trump and his travel ban is very poor But most importantly the film wasn't that good , an actual documentary would have been better",Patriots Day

This causes great concern for the Police and they badly need to know and find out who caused the bombings and the identities of the suspects. Sergeant Tommy Saunders also starts looking into this case with help from many people including Commissioner Ed Davis(played by John Goodman), Superintendent Billy Evans etc. The FBI also become involved which causes tension between the FBI and the cops and FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers(played by Kevin Bacon) has his ways on how to find out about the suspects.

But I did find it ridiculous that all of this and all the wars seems to be based on religion whether it's being a Muslim or being a Christian they all seem to have a bad outcome. I do also, think the movie could bring a lot of generalizing towards people of the Muslim ""faith"". I do think the movie was very moving in a sense for the survivors who decided to run again which of course was beautiful, but still was showing it's own confirmation bias on how strong Boston could be.

Take the case of the Boston Marathon bombing, the largest terrorist attack in the US since 9/11, show it through the eyes of several regular people, first introducing their personal lives and then following them along the course of the main events. And finally, when it's all over, add some first-person moral lessons and conclusions, so that we all realize for sure how important and pivotal that event was for the people and for the world, and feel privy to its changing momentum.All by itself, it's a pretty good, even noble approach. But there's a tiny little detail that changes everything: that all that must sell somehow, because even the extraordinary stories have to be entertaining. So the otherwise consistent and self-sufficient story is being infused with dramatization, laying it on even thicker where it's already been thick, and creating moments that might not have been there in the first place simply to make the story more of a thriller. A very similar thing happened just recently with Deepwater Horizon.The result becomes a product with the typical Hollywood spin, but proudly called ""based on real events"". That it might be, but on the basis of real people's actions, beliefs and lives there has been put enough creative imagination for the film to feel at times fake, at times cheesy and at times way over the top. And we will never know for sure if some or other moments that touched each of us personally happened for real, or they were skillfully injected by the filmmakers to genetically modify the movie and make it more appealing to the audience. Having fallen for this trick before, I refuse to be bought so cheaply again. So I really wish movies such as Patriots Day were made as documentaries. Yes, maybe they wouldn't sell as much, but at least they would be sincere and true. And what if not truth and sincerity do such stories try to uphold?",Patriots Day
114,daniellawson-14-787057,Too important for its own good at times,7,9 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Wahlberg gives a career best performance in this film
2) Every scene with Wahlberg, Goodman and Bacon is excellent
3) The bombing scene and the action scenes are shot very gritty and realistic which is what a film like this needsNEGATIVES:1) It essentially has one large negative and that is that it's trying so hard to be important and impactful that it makes the film worse. Firstly, it's too long. There's no need for it to take half an hour before the bomb actually goes off. There are also too many unimportant characters. This links into the length but also with the importance of the film. There is too much time spent needlessly away from Bacon, Goodman and Wahlberg to follow characters that aren't that important. It seems that the only reason they featured these pointless characters so prominently was so that they could show the footage of the real life people at the end. For example, getting JK Simmons to play a superintendent that is only semi-important in one scene just so the real life superintendent could come on at the end. This is present throughout the film and hurts it a lot. This film should only be 90 minutes long and the extra 45 minutes is pointless padding out of pointless characters",Patriots Day

116,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,9,4 February 2017,"On April 15th, 2013, the city of Boston was devastated by an unexpected terrorist attack during their annual Boston Marathon. A day that was meant to be peaceful, joyful and vibrant throughout became a tragic event and started a manhunt for the attackers and made the world show that Boston was strong and the world itself. This event is the main plot of this latest offering from director Peter Berg and returns Mark Wahlberg among with a cast of solid actors that retells this true story with a great amount of emotion, detail to the events and direction.The film retells the event of the Boston Bombing and the subsequent terrorist manhunt for the perpetrators through the lives of police officers, FBI agents, the terrorists and even some of the victims of the bombing attack, showing its true nature of the story, even showing the Watertown shootout and the end of the manhunt that brought unity and justice for the victims and the police crew involved.Much like Deepwater Horizon and Lone Survivor, it carries a very strong and emotional tone to the film, ensuring that the true event is something that cannot be forgotten so quickly after 3 years. Berg's direction is as strong as ever.The acting from the cast overall is pretty much solid and convincing throughout, notable performances include Wahlberg, Goodman, Simmons and Bacon. The script is on point with no moments of dullness or even altered events. The music score is great and it's composers are the acclaimed Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl) who bring the tension to the key sequences and the emotional final scene.Overall, Patriot's Day is a gripping, confronting and true to the core story that will remind us of not only the events that had unfolded but a reminder that terrorism that happen anywhere at anytime but the human spirit can be more powerful than terror itself and bring a sense of unity.4.5/5 9/10.

117,danielharden,Boston Strong,9,4 March 2017,"The first Peter Berg movie I saw was Battleship. Yes I'm one of the few who actually saw Battleship. So my first impression of the director wasn't a fond one. Next came his first collaboration with Mark Walhberg, the good movie with a spoiler for a title that is, Lone Survivor. Then Berg follows that up with last years Deepwater Horizon, his best film to date in my opinion. Now, Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg team up for the third time to bring us Patriots Day, a film about the Boston marathon bombings in 2013 and the manhunt for the bombers that took place immediately after. Peter Berg has come a long way since Battleship as Patriots Day is his best film by far, and seeing as it came out around November-December 2016 in America, this is a major Oscar snub.The directing in this film was fantastic. The decision to use documentary techniques in this film is admirable and works really well in this film. Berg uses real archive footage in this film which brings an added layer of realism to this film and ups the emotional level the audience feels when watching this film. I noticed how I felt during the film and how much more invested and engaged I was than normal. It doesn't feel like you are watching a film filled with actors and obvious fakeness. It feels like you are watching a moment in history play out as it did, and I attribute this to Berg's fantastic use of documentary techniques. Berg also brilliantly directs his action sequences and masterfully handles tension to a point where it is hollywoodised but still maintains that realism that makes this film so great. Berg channels his inner Paul Greengrass to bring us a movie he very well should have been Oscar nominated for.The acting in this film is really good as well because it never feels like you are watching an actor or a character, it feels like you are watching a real person. Obviously the actors are playing real life people, but it's done so well you almost wouldn't know they weren't the real guys. Mark Wahlberg has one of his best performances to date in this film and should have been given award consideration.The films script is outstanding. The dialogue is realistic and the people in this film are done justice as they are portrayed as real people, even the bombers. That's what was so intriguing about this film, you didn't just get archetypal villains in this film, instead we get two brothers, one of them who is a serious Muslim with a wife and two daughters, the other is an asshole college student like any other. I feel this elevated the tension I experience and my investment into this film, as these real life bad guys were portrayed so vividly, so credit to screenwriters Peter Berg, Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer as well as actors Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze for bringing life to these real life people/ characters.Overall, Patriots Day is a breathtaking movie with outstanding acting, writing and directing that does justice to the people involved. It's a thrilling movie that knows how to effectively tap into your emotions and takes full advantage of that ability. It may have taken two men weeks or even months to plan hate. But love responded in an instant.",Patriots Day
118,Solnichka,"No need for this film whatsoever ... just more attempts to make Boston seem ""strong""",2,8 January 2017,"First, why was this movie made? Three people died. Big deal. How many people died in Oklahoma City back in 1995? Almost 200, including CHILDREN, yet filmmakers decided *this* was more worthy of a movie? Please. This was nothing.That being said, every actor in this movie takes the ""Boston thing"" too far ... enough with Wahlberg already. Director Peter Berg should have cast someone not so laughable in the lead role. But I guess Matt Damon wasn't available? Kept waiting for Ben Affleck to show up, along with the rest of the ""Good Will Hunting"" cast of characters. J.K. Simmons is alright, because he's J.K. Simmons. But John Goodman was better as Babe Ruth than he is in this film.This whole movie is just a token effort to augment Boston's inferiority complex with the greater cities in this country (NYC, for example, which suffered REAL tragedy on 9/11). Waste of time, waste of money, waste of celluloid. Again, if filmmakers want to make a real film about a real tragedy, try OKC instead. Or maybe they're just afraid to cover DOMESTIC terrorism and chose this film to enhance America's illogical and irrational fear of Islam.",Patriots Day

120,themovieparadise,Excellently Made and Entirely Respectful,9,17 January 2017,"There are so many ways this movie could have gone wrong. It could've been too brutal and gory with its depiction of what happened. It also could've sensationalized it, and turned it into an action movie. But instead, it walks an incredibly thin tightrope that results in a perfectly balanced movie. It's brutal enough to show the horrors inflicted on the city of Boston, but not too brutal to overdo it. It's entertaining enough to keep audiences enthralled, but not too entertaining to make it feel like a Jason Statham action film or something. It perfectly weaves in humor and heartbreak to make a total package of a film that I don't think could've been done any better. It's not a perfect film, but I don't think you could've made a better movie about the Boston Marathon bombings. It serves to put a spotlight on the heroes who worked endlessly to save lives, and to garner respect for those who were injured or died.

7.4 on IMDB.
69% on Metacritic.
88% of google users liked this movie.I randomly saw this movie on Netflix on 5th of July.This movie glorifies police officers as HEROES and completely disregards the MEDICAL HEROES that helped the injured and saved lives (e.g. doctors & nurses).I think this Hollywood dramatization of what happened was fine, even though it was not 100% accurate like a documentary would be. It is a Hollywood film. I did like how they incorporated REAL footage into the movie so effortlessly; it gave it realism. I liked the film from start to finish. The cast was great and they really did look like their REAL life counterparts which you can tell when you see the real life videos that were incorporated into the film at the end.However, this is not a perfect movie. There were two sides to this crisis that happened in the Boston Bombings: one side was a MEDICAL crisis and the other side was a SECURITY crisis. This movie only showed glimpses of the medical crisis; I mean this was a total disservice to the medical personnel, the HEROES, that saved lives during this catastrophe and tended to the injured. Instead this movie focused on how police officers and the FBI haunted down and found the bombers. This movie ONLY DEPICTS AS HEROES the police officers and the FBI and completely forgot about the MEDICAL HEROES that took care of all the injured people and lives they saved.Conclusion: this is a HOLLYWOOD film that dramatized the events of a horrendous terrorist attack and portrays police, FBI, and city officials as heroes. This film does attempt to be realistic by having cast that look like their real-life counterparts as well as by incorporating real life footage. The casting and actors were good, the screenplay/script was great, the director, etc., all was good actually. it is a good film. However, this Hollywood film is NOT 100% accurate as a documentary would be, and also they did not give the medical heroes (doctors & nurses) fair time and recognition in the film who were INDISPENSABLE during this two-sided (security & medical) catastrophe.8/10",Patriots Day
124,Rawal_Afzal,"Intense thriller, nail-biting moments!!!",10,22 March 2017,"Firstly, I know about the Boston Bombings just as a headline, so there's a chance that people who followed every thin detail of it would be acting far less edgy whilst watching the film, given they'd be aware of a lot of the stuff anyway. So for me, some of the scenes were really intensely thriller, especially the Chinese guy whom they held as hostage and who escaped. The way he runs away to the store and bags for the police to be informed, awesome acting and extremely well made scenes. Gripping and engaging is the least way of course to describe the encounter between the terrorists and the police. That period of good 10-15 minutes was really high voltage stuff.Secondly, since I don't really know exactly how much of the film or how accurately it is made on the bombings and especially the whole search of the culprits, so I'd just take it as a film that I highly enjoyed. The emotional aspect of the film of course cannot be undermined or dismissed. It must've felt very personal to all the affectees, and it was very nice of them to have included short little interviews at the of people who were related to this. The case of that young couple of whom both lost a leg each is really touching and moving.It's a bit hard to conclude that it's anti-Muslim propaganda based on the answers given by one of the terrorists' wife, the one about Muslim wives being slave and all that, because from the side of the film-maker, it can be argued that they're not attributing such mentality to Islam or the common Muslims, but instead to the wife of a terrorist, and it's no secret what the line of thinking is of religious fanatics, be they be from any religion. The mention of terror attacks in other countries' cities was really good, especially of a city like Islamabad which belongs to a Muslim country of course.",Patriots Day
125,NikkoFranco,A Tribute to those who perished at the Boston Marathon Bombing,8,25 May 2018,"Whether the reenactment is a hundred percent accurate or not, I will let other people be the judge of that. For me the film as typical of Hollywood productions, it will be sanitized yet exaggerated to the point that there's always the hero and antihero. In real life, that is not exactly how it plays , some scenes- specifically the sort of simplified homefront of the deceased terrorist is a bit too profiled for me. Mark Wahlberg is believable as one of the local police, the rest of the cast a bit here and there, and yes, the predictability of endless tension between factions is there as well. Also there are some typecast characters , like the Chinese student whose car was taken by the brothers and how by being smart is able to flee from them. The shooting scenes are to me, a bit over the top, as in really, no one out of that neighborhood ( except a guy who threw his weapon to the police- get èm dialogue ) came out to peek? Well, from what I have seen in America even when it´s DUI the entire street always comes out to watch so maybe they really followed the instruction to stay inside. It has loopholes but still a decent watch and hope some percent of the revenue proceeds to the family of the victims.",Patriots Day

132,makleen2,A Gut-Wrenching Portrayal of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing,7,25 September 2017,"Patriots Day follows fictional Boston police sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) as he helps track down brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who detonated two bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The tragedy occurred at 2:49 p.m. local time on April 15, 2013. Massachusetts celebrates Patriots' Day on April 15 to commemorate the anniversary of Lexington and Concord, the first battles of the Revolutionary War. It's estimated around 500,000 spectators attend the marathon. The bombs, made from pressure cookers, detonated 12 seconds apart, killing three and wounding approximately 264.The film opens the night before the marathon, establishing a backstory for Sergeant Tommy Saunders. He is a well-meaning cop who got into a fight and has to pull guard duty at the marathon finish line before he can assume his regular duties. From there, we are shown snapshots of characters as they get up and start their day, but it is unclear how most of them will tie into the plot. We see future bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, his wife and daughter, at their apartment. Their morning is not typical, as one watches a video of masked terrorists demonstrating how to construct a pressure cooker bomb.The terror, gut-wrenching shock, and confusion of the bombing is dramatically portrayed, as is the following manhunt. We see both law enforcement and the Tsarnaev brothers as they head for a fiery confrontation in the Boston suburb of Watertown. Moments of humor break up the dramatic, heart-racing scenes. During the final shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers, a man tosses a sledgehammer from his porch at police officers crouched behind the fence. ""Give 'em hell!"" he shouts, as if the crude melee weapon will do anything against the terrorists' guns and homemade bombs.It is meant to show defiance and resiliency in the face of terror, and Patriots Day is full of such crowd-pleasing moments, but how accurately does the film depict these events? In one controversial scene, police bring Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife, Karima/Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist), in for questioning. A team from an unknown government agency intercepts her, and the police simply allow them to take Karima into a room alone, no questions asked. There, a woman pretending to be a devout Muslim seems to know everything about her background and laughs at her requests for a lawyer. This scene implies there is some kind of shadowy anti-terrorism agency with more authority than the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security. Did this extralegal interrogation actually take place, or was it added to the film for dramatic purposes?(A little of both, it turns out) Katherine Russell's lawyer says it never happened, and that she cooperated with investigators. Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the Boston FBI at the time of the marathon, told NPR News in Boston, ""This movie wasn't meant to be a documentary I think you have to grant Hollywood a little bit of artistic license in the making of a movie that is not necessarily meant to be an exact replication of every detail of an investigation, shall we say."" Historical accuracy is important for a film like this because this is how millions of people, now and in the future, will remember the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Participants and eyewitnesses can attest to its accuracy, but for the passive viewing public who may or may not have seen the events unfolding on television, this will be their primary source when it comes to the event and its aftermath. I hoped this wasn't another Lone Survivor (2013), which while a great movie, took a lot of liberties with the facts.If this movie has a flaw, it's lack of context. Patriots Day assumes the viewer already knows the basic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The morning of the bombing, it introduces nearly a dozen characters whose connection to the story, in some cases, isn't revealed until near the climax. The audience is given little to no background on the Tsarnaev brothers. It is unknown how they became Islamic terrorists or what motivated them to commit the bombing. Instead, the events are rationalized as ""love overcoming hate,"" or ""good triumphing over evil."" That's all well and good, but it does nothing to explain why the bombings occurred. In a missed opportunity to establish their motives, the Tsarnaev brothers carjack Dun Meng(Jimmy O. Yang) on their way to commit another bombing in New York City and have a conversation with him about how the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 were really perpetrated by the government to make Muslims look bad. I was left wondering how bombing a marathon helps improve public perceptions of Islam.Establishing an antagonist's motivation is usually easy. Everyone understands greed, obsession, or a desire for revenge. All Meng's character had to do was turn to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and ask, ""Why?"" It's a believable question anyone in his position might ask. Even the character of Salim Abu Aziz, ""The Sand Spider,"" in the spy-comedy True Lies (1994) explains his motivation. Even a one-liner about payback for the War on Terror, or devotion to Jihad, would have been better than nothing.Nuances aside, and with the exception of Mark Wahlberg's character, Patriots Day accurately portrays the horrific events of April 15, 2013 and their aftermath. The incredible shootout with police in Watertown, in which the Tsarnaev brothers threw homemade bombs and Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons) grappled with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, actually happened. Patriots Day is a cinematic tribute to the slogan ""Boston strong."" It is a moving and ultimately inspiring portrayal of how a community came together in the face of this tragedy.",Patriots Day

I will watch it again and I reccomend to all the people that have heard of the Boston marathon bombing which is basically everyone. This movie will blow you away with the acting and the vast events and characters and the acting is phenomenal.

134,LLgoatJ,Very slow start but worth sticking with.,7,24 February 2017,"I nearly didn't finish watching this film but glad I did. The first part of the film, the lead up to the bomb is dull. To the point I nearly gave up after 20mins of the film. I found it quite hard to follow as it flicked from filmed footage. CCTV footage and TV footage. The film gets going once they start hunting for the bombers. The literally explosive shoot out between the police and bombers in a residential street will keep you glued to the screen. The film stirs up your emotions that you are willing them to find them. I don't know the exact details of the real events but some of the film felt like it had been dramatised from the real events. The last 10mins of the film has interviews with the real life victims and law enforcement involved in investigating the bombing. This gave the film context and puts you in the shoes of the investigators desperate to find and stop the bombers. Overall if you get through the first part of the film it does get a decent film to watch. The acting is great. Well worth a watch. The last 10mins justifies the film alone.",Patriots Day
135,parleon-thedon,Patriots Day - Review: Solid Courage,10,13 January 2017,"Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have worked together before, every time they do they create magic.Mark Wahlberg is not my favorite actor, but he and Peter Berg make a good team. Wahlberg's character and performance of were appealing.Peter Berg created something that kept it's audience locked in and engaged.If I had to sum this movie up with two words... tense and nail biting.This movie is an account of what transpired before and after the event of the bombing. Many character perspectives are present throughout this thing, they all have something to do, and they all play a part. At first, it seemed like the sub stories didn't have a sense of connectivity, but as the movie progressed it all eventually came to a head. I like the fact that we got to look into the lives of some regular bystanders who were at and affected by the event.The cast in Patriots Day is a powerhouse of talent. Kevin Bacon, John Goodman, and J.K. Simmons deliver nothing but some of the best performances you'll ever see on the big screen. All of the actors play their roles with professionalism and perfection.Peter Berg's movies are intense and sensitive. He doesn't shy away from getting down to the nitty-gritty. Some people might call his movies exploitative, but I don't think that's the case. Berg handles his movies with grace and ease. Even though he tackles serious subject matter, he knows how to convey a story. He makes you feel for the characters and situations.I cried throughout many scenes. Not only was the event horrific, but knowing that many people lost something during that madness were heartbreaking. I imagined myself in their situations. Seeing and having that sense of realizing what the people had to go through there is tragic. But, there was some light that shined down upon the darkness. People came together and united, and the movie illustrated that perfectly.The movie is intense. Action scenes feel like action scenes, but there's this sense of urgency. There's this sort of authenticity to Berg's action scenes. He tackles them head on, doesn't shy away from anything, and yet he gives us that feeling of I care about what's happening on a grand level.Overall, Patriots Day is a solid movie about strength and courage over fear. The performances here are solid, every actor delivers, and all their characters bring something to the table. Berg directs this movie with care, but he doesn't shy away from showing viewers the grim and gritty details.Final Grade: A",Patriots Day

138,sunraider,Mediocre By-the-Numbers Tale,6,14 January 2017,"Patriot's Day is a a fairly routine by-the-numbers drama about the Boston Marathon bombings and the hunt for the two brothers. Unfortunately, instead of a docudrama giving us an inside look at the important political and LE players and the decisions made, the film focuses on Whalberg's fictional, composite character and he drags the movie down. Whalberg's ""Tommy Saunders"" is a fairly unlikable character. He's facing suspension, has a bad attitude, and hobbles around on an injured leg. Every time he came on screen the film lost momentum as it took the focus away from the really important decision makers. The film's run-time definitely seems padded with unnecessary scenes showing us the victims' mundane lives before the bombings and the domestic bliss and/or squabbles of the fictional Tommy Saunders and other law enforcement. There were only two sequences in the film that I found gripping. One was the carjacking/kidnapping and eventual escape by the Chinese man. I didn't recall that part of the event and I was genuinely concerned for and cared about the young man. The other sequence that stood out was the interrogation of the wife. It was dramatically underplayed and the tension was palpable. The film would have been better served had it concentrated on these types of realistic scenes and simply cast top-quality character actors instead of a top star that required extensive time in front of the camera. Love Mark Whalberg but he was totally unnecessary and actually a hindrance in this movie.",Patriots Day
139,anil-kulkarni-108-85663,Bomber routine,5,24 October 2020,"A matter of fact retelling of the day the Boston marathon was bombed by Islamic Terrorists this is a surprisingly insipid affair. Maybe the director did not have much leeway given he was narrating facts but still the story runs a linear track and delivers the goods with little to no surprises. Handily there are names of prominent characters in the drama that hover over the screen characters. Mark Wahlberg plays a character that he could do in his sleep with 2 or 3 key scenes going in his favor. It's a watch for an idle time when you want nothing heavy to go down. Some plotting is wierd, the terrorists are two dumb clucks who dont seem to have any qualms about getting caught and / or identified. Their actions defy common sense and eventually they get whats coming. Anyway said enough.",Patriots Day
140,RLTerry1,Emotionally intense–not for the faint of heart,8,11 January 2017,"Patriots Day is the dramatic account of the Boston Marathon Bombing and manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Starring a powerhouse cast on top of extensive research, this film couldn't come at a better time when there exists such a low general public opinion of law enforcement. Boston Police Department (BPD) shines as it shows that law enforcement officers and officials truly care about the city they are responsible for protecting. Although tragedies often are more conducive for a documentary film, writer-director Peter Berg combines the information found in a doc film with cinematic storytelling techniques to successfully construct a narrative that will rock you to the core and keep you on the edge of your seat. With the inclusion of first person, news, and surveillance footage, Patriots Day does not shy away from the visceral horror that befell the City of Boston and surrounding areas. You think you may know the story, as I did, but nothing will prepare you for coming face to face with one of the most tragic events in modern U.S. history.Ordinarily, this is where I summarize the plot; but the plot is mostly known all too well. Fortunately, this film goes beyond the news reports and constructs a diegesis (story/narrative) around the stories of eye-witnesses, victims, the wounded, medical first responders, and law enforcement– both local and federal.Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, J.K. Simmons, and the rest of the principle and supporting cast deliver outstanding portrayals of the real men and women who were instrumental in the response to and apprehension of the bombers as well as those who fell victim to the arson and shrapnel. It isn't often that films depicting tragedies are produced this close to the events contained therein. Occasionally, there are films about tragedies that are truly better suited for a documentary; but, in order to convert it to a cinematic motion picture, a love story is added for diegetic affect. That is not the case with Patriots Day. The focus is on the BPD, FBI, and medical first response to the bombing and massive manhunt that ensued immediately after the explosions. There are certainly romantic relationships indirectly connected to the narrative, but they are mostly included to juxtapose the everyday life that everyone thought they were going to have on April 15, 2013 against the horrifying events that transpired at America's longest running marathon, which has become such an iconic event each year.Logistically and diegetically, there is a simple answer as to how this tragedy was so successfully translated to the silver screen so close to the day it occurred whereas other tragic events (mass shootings, bombings, aero-spacial, maritime, etc) are more conducive for and translate to a documentary better. This tragic event is a combination of (1) the explosions themselves (2) the manhunt afterwards and (3) the impressive work of law enforcement. There is more to this story than the bombing itself. Certainly the bombing was the catalyst for the events that ensured afterwards, but the real story is of the incredible actions of law enforcement and other first responders. While there seems to be a general focus in broadcast news media on the negative actions–whether perceived or otherwise–of law enforcement officers, this powerful film shows police officers in a positive light–shows them as individuals who love the city under their protection and stop at nothing to protect the innocent. This is so important in today's climate of scrutiny of public safety officials.The cinematography, visual effects, and production design are flawless. So incredibly realistic that you will likely feel transported from your seat into the film itself. To my surprise, the film included interviews with key figures directly involved with or affected by the Boston Marathon Bombing. It's not uncommon to include photos with textual exposition on the lives of central figures in a historical film; but this film goes beyond telling you ""where they are now"" or what happened after the events in the film. It includes video footage of interviews–you get to hear from the individuals upon whom the characters were based. I could not think of a better ending to a film such as this one. Patriots Day works because it is the best of what a documentary offers with the brilliance of cinematic storytelling techniques.For those of you who appreciate historical films depicting tragic events, then this is one that you need to watch. It is not a film to be enjoyed in the conventional sense, but one that packs a powerful message and neither glorifies nor undermines the real historic event. Such a visceral film. Rated R for adult language.Written by R.L. TerryEdited by J.M. Wead",Patriots Day

144,kiowhatta,The real tragedy is this occurs every day in forgotten places,6,7 January 2021,"I can sympathise with the victims of this particular attack, yet, however I couldn't ignore the feeling that the portrayals of the victims seemed hand-picked for maximum sentimental impact.
What I couldn't ignore is the terrible injustice that attacks like this-far worse-go on almost every day in places like Palestine, Yemen, Sudan and other countries that most Western Democracies cannot deny they are somehow directly or indirectly responsible - be that because they sell banned arms to favoured groups, undermine foreign governments for their own gain, or outright back coups which install governments that favour their own economic interests.
My issue with this and many films like it, is the political messaging contained within that the U.S. is a passive victim and a bright light of truth, justice, and freedom; the leaders are unaware of the destruction they sow.
I'm sure many will attack this review as misguided; however simply telling the story without overt political messaging would have been fine, I will not be manipulated into believing that this story represents the true overall narrative that it pretends to.
Again, I feel for the victims - ideology is a dangerous weapon and we all need to learn that things are not what they seem.",Patriots Day
145,TheTruthDoor,Another Peter Berg Cookie Cutter Film,4,17 January 2017,"Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have a cookie cutter approach to film making and they use this approach to Patriots Day. You know when you see a film by these two it is going to end with photos of dead people on the screen.Is this a good film? Sort of....especially if you are from Boston or a marathon runner.Is it substantial to the rest of America? hmmmmm, not really.The plot is easily guessed before each scene even if you don't know the history of the bombing.**spoiler alert** Honestly the only scene in the movie that is worth watching and is exciting is a shootout between the cops and the bombers in a Boston neighborhood. I didn't know this was as dramatic as the movie portrayed it to be.**spoiler alert** But the scene with Mark Wahlberg crying was so unbelievable and over done, it made the whole film lose credibility.Should you see this movie?

Watched in class and half the students around me were crying by the end and I can't stop thinking about it. 
Putting real archival footage in this was an excellent decision made by Berg, and made it feel that much more real.My main complaint was that the cast was really star-studded and gave away who lives and dies in the movie relatively quickly. John Goodman isn't signing onto a role just to be killed halfway through. I would have like lesser known or newcomer actors to play the leads, would've just felt less familiar that what it was when using well known actors.",Patriots Day

148,yourfavoritecritic,"Berg and Wahlberg, the Dynamic Duo",8,24 July 2017,"Patriots Day, tells the in depth true story of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the events that followed the incident, with a city wide manhunt for the individuals responsible. Patriots Day, is directed by Peter Berg and stars Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Kevin Bacon and J.K Simmons. This movie marks the third collaboration between writer/director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg, and even though I was hesitate about the film going in, as this was such a recent event, due to the track record of Berg and Wahlberg, I stayed casually optimistic and I am glad I did. Patriots Day, tells the powerful and tragic events that occurred in Boston four years ago during the Boston Marathon. The film tells the story in a gripping yet truthful way, that doesn't try to glorify the events that transpired. Like I say with every Peter Burg film, he finds a way to bring humanity to disaster films and make the audience actually care about the characters. This is a quality that has worked in Burg's previous films and really shines here. Patriots Day, opens with a lot of set up; many characters are introduced that'll all be affected by the bombing in some way. At first I was a little worried, since the movie seemed to have an overabundance of characters that I felt some were getting more time to shine than others and in some cases certain characters would be dropped and wouldn't come back until later on, when their integral scene took place. However that storytelling device, did work for the most part as I felt by the end it wrapped up nicely as each character was handled well, despite the choppiness of its editing. The only backstory that I felt could have been dropped was a police sergeant, played by J.K. Simmons. He doesn't really have much to do in the movie, and even though his character played a fundamental part during an intense scene, I felt the character's backstory really wasn't necessary and could have been easily replaced to explore more of the other narratives at hand. I did enjoy J.K. Simmons in the movie though, as I did with everyone else other than the actors who played brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrators behind the bombing. I felt them to be the weakest aspect to this film, particularity the actress who played Tamerlan's wife, many of her line deliveries weren't well done, and compared to the talent around her, she stuck out like a sore thumb. I feel theses actors and actress were only cast due to their appearance, as they have similar traits to that of their real life counterparts. My only other complaint about this film, is its use of comedy. Light moments are needed in intense films like this, but the way those moments were handled felt very out of place, you'll go from an intense gun fight, to an oblivious neighbour, ""trying"" to help the cops by tossing them a sledgehammer. Other than those few problems, I really liked this film, though it may not be as sound as Burg's last film, Deepwater Horizon, this was still a really strong effort and I cant help but recommend it. It is a dark story, but it's also a tale of strength and how no matter how much evil will try knock us down, love will always persevere. This is one of 2017's strongest films so far and for that reason Patriots Day gets a 8/10.",Patriots Day
149,SHB_73,Marathon Heroes,10,25 February 2017,"I had reservations about seeing this movie, mostly because the event happened in my hometown. I had felt it was too soon to have a movie made about the Boston Marathon bombings. I remember the day as if it was yesterday,I felt the same way I did after 9/11. After seeing the movie I felt the right people were in charge and it turned out to be a great film. Patriots day takes place the day of the bombing on 4/15/13 on Boylston Street. Mark Wahlberg plays Tommy Saunders, a character who is basically a composite of all the police officers who assisted on that tragic day. Kevin Bacon who plays FBI agent Richard DesLauriers does a good job John Goodman as commissioner Ed Davis was great (though he should have worked on his Boston accent. The movie centers on the day of the bombings and the manhunt to find the terrorists responsible. Film director Peter Berg did a fantastic job researching for the film including talking to the family members of their deceased loved ones as well as talking to the people who lost limbs to get recollections of that day. The family of Martin Richard, the 8 year old boy who lost his life requested that their family not be the focus of the movie and Peter Berg honors their wishes. Martin is not named but there is a scene where a state trooper is keeping guard over his dead body, a truly emotional scene. Patriots day is a terrific tribute to the brave men and woman who risked their lives on April 15 2013. There is one note Krystal Campbell who lost her life was from my hometown. Today a memorial garden in her memory which also has the names of the other victims of that tragic day was dedicated in 2016. In Memory of Krystal, Martin, Lingzi Liu, and MIT officer Sean Collier. This movie is a remarkable tribute to them. Boston Strong!!",Patriots Day
150,anthonymichaelbangert,Superb Acting Makes Me Relate to a Terrorist,10,18 March 2017,"Directed by Peter Berg (Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon) comes Patriots Day, a movie about the true people involved in the events of the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013. It tells the story of the police involved, focusing in on Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg), a fictional character who exists as an amalgamation of many cops involved in the case. It also focuses on the bombers themselves (Themo Melikidze, Alex Wolff), as they attack Boston in an act of terror, and then try to escape to New York City for another attack. This movie works on so many levels. First, the story is grounded in realism. This event happened just a few years ago, so the pressure to get it right was high. The actors all had a difficult, emotional job to do. They each performed fantastically. The main 2 stars to pay attention to in this are Mark Wahlberg, who gives one of the most performances of his career, and Alex Wolff as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the younger bomber. Wolff portrays this man not as a monster, but rather a sympathetic human being. This is extremely difficult given the subject matter, but his performance actually made me care about him quite a bit. The direction is extraordinary. Berg puts in clips from actual security feeds from that fateful day to create a realistic account of the brother's actions post-bombing. He also filmed the bombing scenes in gritty, sickening, realistic ways to give a sense that the viewer was actually there them self. Patriots Day is one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a fantastic and emotional time. Check this one out. 100/100",Patriots Day
151,waterman1976,An impactful movie,7,2 December 2020,"I'm a big Mark Wahlberg fan, so this movie has that advantage already. But on it's own, it's a strong tale about a tragic incident. A good cast (J.K. Simmons always works for me, it was good to see Kevin Bacon again and Michelle Monaghan is gourgious as always and she brings a good amount of drama with her), a good build-up and an overall realistic atmosphere. Also due to the mixing with real-life footage of the situation. I can imagine this movie even being stronger if you're american. Especially with the true testimonies at the end from the actual victims and this makes the title of the movie legit. I'm aware that patriotism is bigger in America then in the Netherlands, but for me personaly I could live without the end. I would have rated the movie an 8 then, instead of a 7.

I went in thinking I was going to be blubbering the whole time, but I didn't end up crying. The emotion of the movie seemed just shy of hitting the mark for me. I'm still trying to get over a sickness, so maybe I wasn't as honed in as I would have been otherwise. The casting was excellent for the brothers and the other real life characters. They spliced actual footage into the movie, confirming their attention to detail when it went back to movie mode. There was just the right amount of levity without feeling out of place or disrespectful. Overall it took the subject matter seriously and stayed true to the timeline of events without too much spin. 7/10.",Patriots Day

What I was impressed with was how accurate and realistically portrayed the events of the Boston Marathon bombing were. I'm glad it wasn't a glorified action movie.Mark Wahlberg (Tommy Saunders) was excellent as you could tell he put a lot of effort into this film and, was passionate about it, considering the involvement of his hometown. Kevin Bacon (Richard DeLaruius) did a great job as the leading FBI agent. John Goodman (Ed Davis) was good as the police commissioner. The guys who played the Tsarnaev brothers were impressive as they looked just like them and acted the sadistic way you'd expect them to be.I liked how they showed actual camera footage. It was a cool way to compare the movie and real life. They showed footage I never saw before. I loved the shootout scene and the intensity of it. Seeing the brother get run over was very satisfying to watch, considering he was the stronger of the two and took the most pleasure in the bombing. The ending was emotional as it was awesome seeing the city come together united. It was great seeing the Red Sox ceremony with all the real people.Overall, I'll give ""Patriots Day"" an 8/10. Great movie that's worth watching.",Patriots Day
154,artmania90,Was this necessary?,8,1 February 2017,"To make a movie about a terrorist attack that happened no more than 3 years ago is questionable in many regards. When studios made 'United 93' five years after September 11th, I seem to recall the uproar of disbelief; statements of ""it's too soon"" and ""this is disrespectful to the victims."" With the Boston Bombing, I'm not sure it's too soon, but there are questionable aspects about the movie itself that might raise a few eyebrows.Director Peter Berg has found himself a curiously specific niche by telling real life tragedies with Mark Wahlberg as his hero. He did it with 'Lone Survivor' and in 2016 with 'Deepwater Horizon.' Whether or not I believe Mark Wahlberg as an everyman (I don't), there is clearly something that the actor does that Berg believes in. In the first two instances, they were real-life characters. Here, I was surprised to learn, is a police officer written solely as a fictional resource to progress the plot. Why we even need a hero is another story, since the film is told as an ensemble, flashing back and forth between 5 or 6 stories. We meet a local police chief who does little in the story until the end when we find out he was the one that actually shot one of the terrorists. We meet a security guard who has a crush on a college student but then later realize his ties to the bombing.It's a faithful retelling of the incidents, beginning the morning of the marathon and concluding when the final suspect was found hiding in a small sailboat in a stranger's backyard. The interweaving of stories is probably necessary to cover an adequate amount of facts, and yet I still found myself wondering why they needed to fictionalize a police officer (Walhberg) when the city was littered with real people who acted as heroes in these horrific conditions. We meed Ed Davis (John Goodman), the Commissioner who worked to release the photos of the attackers to the public swiftly, and we meet the Federal Officer in charge of the case, Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) who wants to break the case but doesn't realize the passion of the citizens of Boston who also want to lend assistance. It was great police work that went into the capture of the Tsarnaev brothers, and yet the film would have us believe that Mark Wahlberg single-handedly worked out all the riddles and clues.I've felt this many times before, but in a lot of ways a documentary might have been better suited to serve the material at hand. Why we need to fictionalize something so fresh in the public's mind is a debate that has been going on for years. It's not surprising that it only took 3 years for the film to come out (and would you believe it that there is a second Boston Bombing movie coming out this year starring Jake Gyllenhaal?). The extraordinary thing about the attack was the way the city rallied together to help, and in fact the most emotional parts of the film come at it's conclusion when we see the real people via real footage talking about the way their lives were forever changed. Hollywood can certainly work magic, but there's sometimes nothing more powerful than the truth.",Patriots Day

If this was a mini-series it could have definitely been way more realistic and hard hitting. All in all though it showed both the qualities that banded a town together, the people, the officers in uniform and the investigators. Not everyone saw eye to eye but their focus was to capture the terrorists that committed such an atrocity. Wahlberg, Bacon, and Simmons truly shine in their roles and bring authenticity to them. From their serious sides to their humour that cops need to use to get through the horrors of the job. The people that assisted in the town an the courage of the victims was inspirational. To watch the credits at the end showing the real people, cops and victims added the extra realism this movie needed and you realize these actors did their homework. Don't pass this one up.

It's an action/drama film about the Boston Bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15th and the manhunt to find the bombers. The film stars Mark Wahlberg plays an officer who helps the FBI agent played by Kevin Bacon who heads a 88 hour manhunt for these two guys who set off the bombs that killed 3 people and hurt 100s of that day.Okay that's the main details of the movie itself. Now what I thought of the actual film was it was really interesting to be honest. I had saw the coverage of the bombing on CNN when it happened but I wasn't familiar with the capturing of the bombers so that was interesting to see. Theirs a scene in the film that's not a spoiler I assure you but theirs a scene where the cops and the bombers are having this set off in the middle of the street with guns, bombs and chaos of the events. I was watching the scene thinking is this a war movie all of a sudden and in a way it was to be honest.Should you rent this film. Yes rent it, you'll love it.

161,ldquinn,A Story Well Told,7,15 January 2017,"Patriots Day is a well told story of the 2013 bombing at the Boston Marathon. I have seen many reviews that criticized the movie for various reasons - too soon after the event, too slow in the beginning, stony acting by Mark Wahlberg, etc. I disagree, respectfully, with all of them.No, this movie is not great art, it's probably not award winning in any category; but, were it not for the subject matter, I'd say it was an enjoyable film and a great way to spend an couple of hours. Rather, it is a solidly built movie that tells a story that makes us remember and think about an important event in history.I did not think this movie was made too soon. I felt it brought to the forefront that only a couple of years ago, we experienced an event of terrorism that is all too frequently still occurring in places both far and near.I found the beginning of the movie well done, cutting back and forth, introducing characters, making us see the normalcy and, in the case of the bombers, their warped vision. As for Mark Wahlberg, Mark is Mark - this is the character he plays - stony and solid - whether it be in this movie or in Deep Water Horizon or Lone Survivor. One dimensional, perhaps, but made for this type character and he delivers a fine performance in the role.I thought there were some directing and script lapses at times; but, they passed quickly.As for the ending, I thought it was very well done - an excellent ending for this movie. Softly said, but quite powerful. As we exited, one of the people in the hallway of the theater, just outside the auditorium said that this movie had to be quite good because everyone exiting was very quiet. She was right, there was no talking between people. I imagine they may have been remembering, sadly, as was I.",Patriots Day
162,sherripadgitt-55536,A Great Film,10,17 June 2017,"I felt this was an excellent movie...it does a great job at introducing each person involved. The story matter involved is of course the Boston bombings that happened a few years back. I never did get the full story then when it happened...just bits and fragments of info that I read about.I learned a quite a few new things regarding that period of time when they were still trying to find the bombers. I had read there was a shootout between the brothers and the police force, but had never imagined what that was really like. The movie gives insight into how law enforcement and the FBI worked to find these two killers. The movie really does a good job portraying the brothers and how they had acted. Too bad they couldn't have been caught sooner. My rating is based on the movie and the actual events that took place. I think the film did a really great job telling this story before the attack through the aftermath.",Patriots Day
163,tomosp1965,Touching and moving.,8,9 August 2020,"I watched this film when nothing else seemed worthy on TV, and after passing on it previously. Initially, I felt it was too raw (As a memory of an awful event) plus feeling it wasn't right to portray such awful events.I was sceptical and dubious that a movie could capture the events in a way that was true to the actual incident, would be informative and was not just an Hollywood cash in.This film was true, was informative, but not in any way did it seem to be cashing in.The characters were believable, the screenplay uncompromising and the casting was excellent. (The two bombers roles especially).I agree with a former reviewer, this film would have been better as a documentary style representation. But, nevertheless, the film is brilliantly portrayed by the cast. Wahlberg, Goodman and Bacon give stellar performances and are very believable indeed.I am sure the film was difficult to make, given the topic, but nonetheless, I'm pleased they did make it.A great film of a terrible event, and well worth seeing. 8/10",Patriots Day
164,dsalouk,Surprisingly good and not campy nor preachy,7,6 February 2017,"Patriots Day is a surprisingly well made movie based on the real events of the Boston Bombing. It is well directed, showcasing Peter Berg's improvement over the years. He combines a great cast to portray an emotional side to the tragic events, as well as present the leg-work behind the scenes of all the emergency departments. Patriots Day, without coming across cheesy, campy, or preachy, truly does combine all the elements to create a movie of which oozes with American patriotism, and the camaraderie, and communal ensemble in the Boston city in particular. Mark Whalberg is a steady consistent player throughout, though not incredible, but the stands out performances come from the always great; JK Simmons, the magnetic Kevin Bacon, and Khandi Alexander; all great choices who stole each scene they were in. Patriots Day speaks for itself as an American movie to remember fallen Americans in an American fashion; which isn't always bad.",Patriots Day

Very interesting, entertaining and most of all emotional story. Solid job by Mark Wallberg and everyone in the cast.

The cops were portrayed as inexperienced, frightened klutzes.Except Wahlberg, who strutted and wisecracked uselessly in front of the camera for 2 hours.

We also see a snapshot of the lives of several of the victims.Although we are bated in forlorn knowledge, the bombings come as we least expect them to appear on the screen -unprepared by the viewer to witness: From there on, the film never losses its grip on emotional intensity.The film spreads out strongly in reportage of the narrative and action: I found myself shocked in the emotional challenges to steady my feelings of hate and revulsion towards the assailants of their callous nature of murder; but of great compassion to the victims, with my unflinching admiration of the courage displayed by the police force and the public alike. I question my own sententious nature to say this is a film I recommend to watch, which has provoked me in the morality issue of choosing to watch the film in the first place. But it is an excellent film if I may say so, with shifts of mood, and with a powerful force of justice and humanitarianism: the message is clear to me -that we seek a united front in rightful liberty, and strength in unified love.Mark Wahlberg is outstanding in portrayal of the police sergeant, as are his co-stars, which include, Kevin Bacon, and J. K. Simmons....the manhunt and capture of the two brother assailants is satisfyingly heady to the point of blood thirsty revenge...",Patriots Day

175,davidarcher,"Flawed by ""composite"" main character",5,14 May 2017,"Patriots Day begins shortly before the Boston Marathon bombings and follows the search for the bombers. Part human-drama, part police- procedural, it's an almost riveting story.With one major problem. Similar to Live By Night, it's flawed by its main character. While Patriots Day is (mostly) a true story and most of the characters are real, the main character is a composite. At each important development in the story, the fictional Sergeant Tommy Saunders (played by Mark Wahlberg) appears, Forrest Gump-like, to steal the attention, credit and glory from the people who were actually there.Wahlberg gets so much screen time that the other actors / characters get lost in the background. Kevin Bacon plays Special Agent Richard DesLauriers, the FBI agent in charge of the investigation. He's potentially the movie's most interesting character, but lives in Wahlberg's shadow. Ditto with the rest of the cast.Wait for the DVD or skip this one.Factoid: Patriots Day is a production of CBS Films and the studio's highest profile film to date.",Patriots Day
176,SteveJ_888,See It,7,3 August 2017,"See ItIf, like me, you have been reluctant to watch this movie fearing that it would amount to a long victim impact statement you can relax. The filmmakers did a good job of showing the extreme horror of the events - the images of the injured are realistic and graphic - without over-emphasizing the pain and suffering caused by the perpetrators of the crime. The actual victims could probably best decide this,but I think the average viewer would feel that the violence was realistic but not over-done.The story, writing, and acting were all strong, but not spectacular. The tone of the movie worked for me. Though fairly long, it moves along well and is somewhat suspenseful - difficult to do when everyone knows the ending. Some reviewers objected, but I enjoyed the documentary-style production. The movie is never slick and sometimes used shaky or grainy images that look like news footage. For me, this enhanced the realism of the film and did not distract. As someone who is familiar with the actual locations I think they got them right. The music - if there was much music - was not melodramatic or obtrusive. I didn't like the ending credit music much, though.The film was well cast and the performances by Kevin Bacon, John Goodman, J.K. Simmons, and others were good to see.The biggest criticism I have is that the film is ordinary and typical of most crime dramas. The characters are believable but not particularly colorful. Mark Walberg's character and the other authorities behave predictably. There are no surprises, and it seems like the filmmakers were not interested in uncovering any new or unusual aspects of the events. Possibly this is due to respect for the gravity of the material. The pressure to not offend anyone must have been substantial.A scene that I especially liked was the interview of the criminal's wife by the authorities, where a Muslim-speaking woman with a head- scarf conducted the interview. I wish there had been more of these two actors in the movie. I also enjoyed the actor whose character was kidnapped by the two fugitives. He was very believable as a regular guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. The murder of the police officer was also realistic and disturbing.I thought the scene of the actual bombing was handled well - neither too much nor too little.I feel that shoot-out with local police was overdone, though, and seemed out of place in the movie. It's as if the filmmakers felt compelled to include an obligatory big action scene. Maybe they were. The scene dragged on and at the same time I think they missed the opportunity to make more of the running-over the older brother with the car. The injuries to the bombing victims were depicted very graphically, so why was it not likewise for the death of one of the perpetrators? It would have been good to see the reaction of the younger brother when he realized he killed his brother.Overall I think the filmmakers did a good job, especially given the sensitive nature of the material and the potential to offend. Perhaps after some time has passed other filmmakers will feel less constrained and be able to go deeper creatively. For now though, this seems about right.",Patriots Day

There is some historical license taken but it still is a earnest effort to tell the story of a important event. With the exception of Mark Wahlberg, like United 93 has a cast of relatively unknown actors and some of the real people involved. It made this movie feel a lot like a modern version of United 93. This movie may as well have been directed by Paul Greengrass. I do personally enjoy and recommend this movie but like United 93, it's not something worth watching if your not willing to shed a tear sometimes.",Patriots Day
179,zachvalencia,Solid film about a tragic event.,7,21 January 2017,"I believe this film was a solid film probably as good as films like this can get. Movies about this can only get so good. I enjoyed the fictional officer mark whalberg portrayed. He played a bad attitude seargent detective. He was facing suspension which had his hat acted be put in uniform but still high up enough in the ranks to communicate in the FBI building. This allowed us to see kinda two sides of how the manhunt went down. I do wish we could see a little more with the investigation and how they narrowed in on the bombers but we do see some of that which is good. The movie was exciting, acting was acceprional, the Bomb scene was excellent. They did a good job of really putting the horror and misery of the bomb into the movie showing how awful the act really was. I don't think dragged on which I was afraid of going into so I was glad about that. I did however have a few minor problems. One was about how they portrayed one of the tsarnev brothers. They portrayed the younger one the college kid as being too influenced by the brother. Although I do believe he was heavily influenced by the older brother they madden him out to be a good kid almost. They made him try to seem almost non violent and just a normal college kid like somebody you'd go to the bar with. I didn't like that because I believe anyone who does an act like this is not normal or chill but violent and insane. Overall the movie was good and I would go watch it again.",Patriots Day
180,mr-roboto-kilroy,Over Rated!,2,20 March 2017,"There are certain types of movies that get a ""free pass"" and are automatically given good reviews because of the subject matter. Usually children's movies, religious movies, movies about gay or lesbians or any other controversial subjects, and movies about national tragedies. I find that this movie has received such good reviews from the critics because they are afraid to criticize it because they could be considered non-patriotic and it's not worth the hassle for them.First off, there are a few good actors in this, but ones whom are not really getting the best leads anymore. They are just okay and do a good job in this flick, but my main issue is with the poor direction, editing and camera work. I believe that the director wanted to go with an independent film look. You know what I mean. It's where they have two or three small HD Digital hand-held cams filming at a shaky POV angle. Then edited into quick scene changes. It reminds me of the type of filming/editing of the old TV Show, Hill St Blues. Some people might find this artistic, but I just found it nauseating. They zoom in way too close to everything and everyone and pan far too quickly. The shots are way too tight and way too shaky. It has a ""high school"" project feel to it. I couldn't really considerate on the movie most of the time, because I was trying to figure out if they were actually recording with good quality smart phones or not.I realize it is based on a true story and should get a ""free pass"", but I found it was very poorly done and it's like the director either just ""phoned it in"" or the director is simply a teenager who wants to break into the business with his first film and who is also the nephew of the top executive of a production company.",Patriots Day

Different characters are introduced at different times and it may take some time before we know where they fit in exactly, but the film is able to jump to different characters without losing any momentum. Mark Walhberg is so good in this. I usually enjoy his movies, this role was perfect for him and he nailed it! The city of Boston and the people in it are amazing!

Don't watch this rubbish, instead just imagine a scene, the aftermath of a devastating terrorist bomb attack. Now add a massive Stars and Stripes flag fluttering and filling most of the shot.

I have to get into the mood. But when I do sit down to this type of film, I do enjoy them, if that is the right word to use, maybe engrossed sounds better. A quality cast of Bacon, Whalberg, Goodman and Simmons was the reason I just clicked on play for this film. First off, the film is done in good taste and some of the news clips I remember vividly, but it showed some of the stuff I totally forgot. The shootout was one of the best if not best action scene in a film based on a terrorist act, the older brother got what he deserved and was it bad of me when I cheered at the screen when his younger brother drove over him dragging him a short distance? What I did feel respectful, giving some of the victims a chance to speak of their views whilst looking back at the end of the film.

The action scene in the Watertown shooting was brilliantly flimed, one of the best scenes I've seen in this type of film. The acting as you would expect from Wahlberg, Goodman, Simmons and Bacon is excellent, the film is gripping, and the ""story"" keeps you engrossed throughout. Now the reality. I couldn't but help remembering some of the news clips, some parts I had totally forgotten about, and it shows the horror of what can happen in our own neighbourhoods giving you a feeling of hatred and anger. I felt all kinds of things watching this film, and makes you wonder where the time has flown considering how long ago it was. It also shows how disgusting the media can be just because they want the scoop, and you have to ask the question, was FOX responsible for the Watertown shooting?

I rented the flick, without knowing anything about the film or who directed it. I knew of the story of course, but the cast was good, and it looked interesting so I rented it. My opinion was cast blindly and honestly. I only looked up the film later to see the details.The movie plays exactly like a made-for-TV movie. It follows the formula to a tee. Peter Berg has done a lot of TV work so it makes sense. Virtually the whole movie was done with hand-held cameras which ensures a jittery constantly moving picture with the exception of the countless aerial shots of Boston. That's really lazy.. The music is a perfect blueprint for the music that is played on TV documentary to unnecessarily boost drama. Again Berg has done a lot of documentaries, so again it makes sense. There is one preachy scene with Wahlberg on the tailgate of a truck that actually made me roll my eyes.. I thought really? Can it be more contrived? John Goodman's character didn't really have anything to do.. J.K. Simmons character is aloof and mostly uninterested and has one of the more ridiculous scenes in the movie. Michelle Monaghan really didn't have a part either. The performances were good, and I love these actors. But there is some big talent wasted on parts that anyone could have played and we wouldn't have noticed.The movie pays tribute to law enforcement, but until the end, they are made to look pretty incompetent and at times, witless. I couldn't understand how that characterization was allowed given the purpose of the movie. It was puzzling. The tribute to the actual victims was very nice.

Patriots Day isn't only an emotional drama, its also a tribute to all those who died in the bombings. It doesn't make a blockbuster out of these tragic events. It tells the story in an incredibly gritty way.Mark Wahlberg gives the best performance of his career as a boston police officer who has to deal with these attacks everyday throughout the man hunt. Several scenes stand out throughout the film. The best in my opinion are a shootout in Watertown and a scene where the bombers kidnap an innocent man. They are done in a suspenseful and tense way that make them some of the most gripping scenes I've ever seen.Overall, Patriots day deserves to be watched.

195,j-w-b-concepts,Tasteful but Unnecessary,4,21 December 2016,"Being from Boston and really a part of all the events that happened that week, I was really looking forward to this movie. I had hopes of seeing a cinematic masterpiece that portrayed the moments of pure chaos and the strength of multiple cities coming together to find the terrorist responsible for the act that was committed on that Marathon Monday. Instead what I got was a Hollywood style visual of a week that was filled with so many ups and downs that was blown way over the top at points. Patriots day had its moments and I am sure will be a huge hit everywhere other than the place where the events took place. Mark Wahlberg was my biggest issue with this movie as he played a made up cop who just so happened to be at every big event that took place that week, spewing his over the top Boston accent and try to give some comic relief at the movies darkest points. Honestly if he was not in this movie and it was still put together the way it was I might have enjoyed this a bit more. There are a few scenes of actual footage from that day mixed with the cinematic footage which was done pretty well at parts. They did a good job of showing the timeline of events that happened and a look at the brothers side where all we have really seen was the medias. It delivered on moments of suspense, fear, and anger, but I think more so because I myself actually was a part of it and it was brining back a lot of memories that were put away but never really forgotten. At the end of it though all I could do was shake my head as the overall movie, Mark Wahlberg's Character, and some of the over the top scenes just really seemed unnecessary. Similar to movies made about 9/11 and other disasters, this will be a cinematic hit to everyone who did not actually live through it and see the events first hand. Not the worst movie of 2016, but what a great way to sum up what has already been a pretty shitty year by slapping you in the face with some horrific memories of a day a lot of us were strongly impacted by.

Patriots day is a movie about the Boston marathon bombings in 2013, plotted by terrorists. The story is based around Tommy Saunders played by Mark Wahlberg. Overall I was amazed of the movie, which is no surprise for Peter Berg I soon realized but the editing, the emotion, the acting was brilliant. I am always attracted to movies with a true story like Hacksaw Ridge, and Deepwater Horizon which was also Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg teamed together as actor and director. The person who went to see the movie with me said it was one of the best movies she's seen. Mark Wahlberg also claims this is the most important film of his career.Actors and directors: Of course Mark Wahlberg did a magnificent job again in this hit film. The movie starred him but the movie didn't really revolve around him throughout the whole movie like deep water horizon. The ""I want pictures of Spider man guy"" J.K. Simmons was also in the film, aged a bit since I've last seen him but he did great as his role, he will also be ""commissioner Gordon"" In the upcoming Justice League movie. John Goodman was also in the movie playing Commissioner Ed Davis, which he played well. Peter Berg as director was great again. The action shots of when the bombs exploded during the marathon were shot so good and the way he recorded the events were magnificent ( not going into too much detail for spoiler purposes ). Plot: The true story movie was about the Boston bombings in 2013. Now when true story are made into movies, they most likely have a big year gap towards the actual event and the movie. Three years isn't a huge difference but I guess Peter Berg couldn't wait to release the hit movie. As you do see though a lot of true story movies are always being released now-a-days more then they did before, I guess directors are running out of ideas.Feedback: If you are a person who enjoys watching movies based off true, shocking events this is another movie for you. I think this movie deserves a bit more popularity, not like it lacks popularity, its just magnificent movies like these deserves to be viewed by a lot more people. A lot of lives got lost on that day and hundreds where injured, with amputated legs and all sorts of horrifying things. This shows you a great dramatization of what happened of the day and the lead of how they take down the terrorists. The movie shows all the brave people who sacrificed time and effort to tack down these people. I recommend everyone go see this movie, whenever you can, I really recommend it. I rate Patriots Day a 8.3/10.",Patriots Day
197,willowwear00,"Great style, story, but...",8,14 March 2018,"It's really hard to find fault with this movie. It shows how law enforcement broke this case in 3 days. The tensions between different branches of law enforcement and politicians. The shootout in Watertown one of best ever filmed.I find some fault with the relative lack of attention to fact that this was ISLAMIC terrorism. The two bombers are portrayed as thugs rather than Islamists, which they were.",Patriots Day
198,ToughestMovieCritic,Worth the watch,9,4 July 2020,"From start to finish, this film is worth watching. Literally was locked in every second of the film and always had we thinking what's going to happen next. Great acting all around and very well produce. Solid A grade for me.",Patriots Day
199,Kirk1973,An entertaining but troubling watch.,7,31 March 2017,"I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this film after watching the disappointing and frankly weird Deepwater Horizon, from the same director and lead actor. Leaving all political comment behind, in the main, I found this wasn't as sickeningly sentimental, dangerously racist and gung-ho as it might have been, but actually a very tense and at times moving version of events we all remember so well from the news coverage of the time.One of the big plus points is the score by Trent Reznor, which pumps the action along very effectively. Also some nice work in supporting roles by J.K. Simmons and Melissa Benoist. On the other side of the coin, Michelle Monaghan and John Goodman may as well have phoned it in, so under-developed were their roles.There are things in here that could be judged as borderline cringe- worthy, but it always just about gets away with it by the fact that it is a damn fine action / chase thriller. Recommended with reservations.",Patriots Day
200,DodsworthMcgillicutty,Authenticity Issues in History,1,5 April 2017,"I like this cast. Very disappointed in all of them for their participation. Yep this is a anti-propaganda review. Check ""not helpful"" now if you have Stockholm Syndrome.In 2012-2013, months before the ""event"", the 1948 Smith Mundt Act was Modernized. It's LEGAL Propaganda. Which means ANY and every story on corporate (state run?) television/film can be scripted according to National Defense. It means Nobody in corporate media will ever be jailed for CREATING news. Since day one of the 2013 event, armchair internet warriors have had an issue with the Bombing and it's authenticity. Quickly ""HOAX"" titled videos grew in popularity. And anyone taking the time to seek out their claims by reviewing videos will indeed find that Jeff Bauman was wheeled to safety across the finish line TWICE. OR that the Boston Globe STILL (as of April 2017) has the tweet up from earlier that day stating ""Officials: There will be a controlled explosion opposite the library within one minute as part of bomb squad activities."" Authenticity issues in this event are not a conspiracy, but indeed founded by anyone who cares to look. Who knows who was really hurt?The movie. Well, it gets worse. Turns out taking civilians cell phones ""for our safety"" is heroic. Things you are also supposed to learn in this film - If you have issues about the motives or official narrative of 9/11, you are just like the terrorists in this movie. Also kicking in doors, martial law style is good, because someone might be hiding in your pantry without your knowledge. In Patriots Day, Root for the hero, not the zero. Safety first!By the time the trailers appeared, some people caught on to the actual event's narrative problems, while other people who were hoodwinked by the bombing mainstream narrative thought this was exploitive and in poor taste. So the advertising campaign turned this into a ""Die Hard"" type genre movie, and hid the actual premise. By then it was too late, and this made a paltry $30 million by begging the public to see it. Earnings were DOA internationally. All the actors are very good, yet still embarrassing themselves in this tripe filmed Greengrass style mess. At least propaganda movie ""American Sniper"" was skillfully done, despite it's cringiness. Add ""Zero Dark 30"" for the ""legal propaganda"" trilogy. Berg, can do no right with me ever. I'll have to forgive Marky Mark though as Boogie Nights is an all-time favorite. And I'm positive ""Patriots Day"" is NOT his top 5, and was probably a blackmail gig, because like it or not, movie stars are somebody's property. They HAVE TO sign onto these movies when called upon. Somebody explain what good these ""real event"" films do for the world?",Patriots Day
201,Altered-Reality,Average movie based on real-life events.,7,24 February 2017,"I saw this weeks ago. Although i am a fan of Mark Wahlberg, this seemed a very run-of-the-mill action crime movie. I cannot detract from the re- telling of real-life events (and never will), but this was average, as far as movie-going is concerned. The trailers, and other promotional aspects make this movie to be incredibly dramatic, and it came up short. I will say that it is still an enjoyable movie though.",Patriots Day

Ann says that this film is truly a  tribute to the people of Boston, ""ordinary people who are called to  show superheroism in a time of tragedy.""  Les thought that Mark Wahlberg was absolutely terrific in this film,  but many people object to the ""composite"" nature of his character.  Wahlberg plays the lead, a fictional character who interacts with  actors portraying real people. Some are disappointed and think that  Wahlberg's character detracts from the real people of Boston.

206,bellomona,No Reason For This Move; Watch A Documentary,1,25 January 2017,"I know what Wahlberg said about making the best version of a movie that was going to be made no matter what, but it's a shame. There's no reason for Hollywood to make up this story when the truth is even better. If you want to know what happened here in Boston, watch a documentary -- a few good ones have been made already. For that reason, what the movie gets right is its use of real film footage of the people and events. The real people speaking in short interviews at the end of the credits was very moving. Showing the photos of the people who died still made me start bawling. We took this bombing very personally. It may not play as emotionally in the rest of the country. What I hated about the film is Wahlberg's insistence on being the ""star"" in so many scenes (he wasn't needed, or remotely factual); how all the officials swore at each other or spoke gung-ho crap (""welcome to Watertown, motherfu**ers!"" yells a cop at the bombers); how the FBI agent was made to look like the bad guy when he was a hero. Just not necessary. Not a wonder so many victims chose not to participate. And whatever you do, please don't listen to any liars who insist this bombing didn't happen or was an inside job. America needs to wise up, alright. Ignorance hurts. Read a good book or watch a documentary about this story. It was definitely an example here of how good ALWAYS conquers evil. Love always wins.",Patriots Day
207,mchertov,"Watchable, but could have been better.",7,28 November 2020,"Patriots Day is an airplane movie, in that it is a good way of spending a few hours. It is not, however, a great movie.I know the events of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing extremely well, so I essentially knew how the story would play out. Despite this, I found the beginning of the movie to be quite interesting. I did enjoy how there are little segments of some of the players, foreshadowing how all of these players would soon be united by tragedy. I even enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's character, as well as all the cop banter.But then it became an airplane movie. Everything becomes disjointed, from the pacing to the dialogue. Having all those players introduced at the beginning? Well, that backfired as the movie tries to focus on all of them. This could have worked, had it been done well. But it was not done well, and all we are left with is at least 30 minutes of complete filler. Maybe more, I can't really say.The one thing that irked me the most was how much screen time they gave the the brothers (I will call them that, since I don't want to use their names). These are COMPLETE filler. These scenes are absolutely useless. If they were to make us sympathize with the brothers, they failed. If they were to help progress the story, they failed there too. If they were to add to the ""authenticity"", that also failed since there was no way of knowing what they actually said to each other when they were alone. These scenes are pure Hollywood speculation. This would be fine...IF IT ACTUALLY SERVED A PURPOSE!Overall, I give this movie a 7-star rating. Not terrible, but not great either.",Patriots Day

It was really well done, being careful getting the story across for the survivors and those whose lives where taken in this act of terrorism. Looking forward to seeing this film again. The heroism in this is amazing, the reality of it including the actual footage of the day makes the film hard hitting, and showing what the police and FBI done to get those to justice was amazing. It was an eye opener with the scenes of Boston being on lock down, no one going outside and everywhere being thoroughly searched was breath taking.",Patriots Day

The best scene of the movie is when they question the wife. i loved Mark Wahlburg, (sp), John Goodman and Kevin Beacon. all of these actors were great. the movie got me and my wife chocked up at times, which rarely happens to me.God Bless the City of Boston, the Police Dept, FBI, Mayor, Gov, the Boston Public, and most importantly...the families that were effected by this horrible day. ...and GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF America.",Patriots Day

And after seeing it, I completely understand, especially considering there were plenty of real people involved, real heroes whose stories were told. But that aside, this is an absolutely amazing film. The tension from scene to scene had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails. And I remember this tragedy, in my dorm room freshman year 2013 after my last class that day, watching CNN all day and night. Today, again, in a packed auditorium of adults tearing up at the film's end - the Memorial section, the 9 year old child who lost his life that day - powerful moments captured, the heart, soul, anger, courage, as well as the look into government and media involvement. Peter Berg does it again. I highly recommend checking this one out asap.",Patriots Day

I liked how they mixed in actual surveillance footage of the Muslim terrorists who bombed the marathon into the actual movie. The actors who played the Muslim terrorists looked a lot like the actual terrorists so it was more real. This would have been a great movie even if it was just a regular action movie that wasn't a true story.

The problem is this - the camera work is so amateurish that it renders the movie close to unwatchable. Hand held, zoomed in far too close, shaky and jerky as bedamned, it is absolutely appalling. Utterly repellent in it's incessant, nauseating lurches. I do not know what lunacy possesses a director to think that disorientating his audience in this way will create anything but intense irritation. There is absolutely NOTHING in its favor.

This film resonates deeply with me because I honestly now comprehend the true destruction the modern day world experiences.By juxtaposing real-life footage with re-inacted footage featuring actors such as the spirited protagonist Mark Wahlberg, this film aids me to uncover the true sense of community in Boston and hence the sense of harmony that we - in our own everyday lives - should promote. This film is the epitome of resilience and heartfelt love and sincerity and the list goes on... THIS FILM, IN MY OPINION, DEPICTS THE UTOPIAN WAY TO DEAL WITH A DYSTOPIAN SITUATION.",Patriots Day

218,jambawala,Wahlberg ruins this movie,3,22 January 2017,"Walhberg is much of what is wrong with Patriots Day. What I wanted was a thriller that highlighted the danger of letting the public play online detectives, a movie that highlighted the immensely challenging investigation and at the same time, the deadly efficacy of American due process. I got some of that, but I also got Wahlberg playing the idiot savant cop who keeps happening to be at the right place and at the right time. The funny thing is, a Leo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise or Matt Damon in Wahlberg's place would have been more endearing and deserving of the star treatment, though it would still ultimately have been a flawed movie. But with the wannabe star Wahlberg, what we get is something worse than flawed - something which approaches mockery of a very serious incident.From a direction standpoint, this subject needed someone who could deftly move from being Paul Greengrass to Tony Scott to Ron Howard. Instead we get Peter Berg deifying an idiotic iceberg called Wahlberg, as usual.",Patriots Day

They could have started the movie at that point, I gained very little by the character introduction. Since I really didn't want to know the motivation of the bombers(they should do a movie on that subject alone) I would call this an action movie. We knew the outcome, so can't say there was any suspense. Go see the movie on account of a great representation of the city and its people, but Wahlberg sometimes looked out of place as if he had been photo-shopped into the movie. Some people do not like the personal accounts at the end, I wholeheartedly believe that they added the humanity that the movie needed.",Patriots Day

222,mariokartwii,Wow just wow,8,16 April 2017,I can't even express how moving this film was. Mark wahlberg is by far the best actor for this part and so does john goodman and Kevin bacon and also let's not forget J.K. Simons. All 4 great actors in one movie out standing. The acting was phenomenal and perfect till the end. This perfectly explains what happened on that day and how they had to shut down the entire city to find this one person. Now there are some things that needs to be changed tho. This film could've done way better with better directing. It's almost like peter berg was trying to copy Michael bay with his camera moving styles and all. He directed and gripping and powerful movie and it will touch you deeply especially the scene where walhberg crys to his wife about what he had scene and how this effected him. Tho it could've done better if peter berg would've just not moved the camera so much. This was supposed to show about heroism and I saw that but it wasn't enough in the film. I didn't get a lot of it I recommend this to anyone who loves mark wahlberg and who wants to watch a great American movie.,Patriots Day

The acting is very good, which is the norm with the great Mark Wahlberg in it. But what I found very poor was the Cinematography.It seemed that the Director told them to zoom in and concentrate on the peoples faces so closely that you could see their pores.And the camera shake was uncalled for along with the regular in and out of focus and the swinging from side to side. And why when Mark turns around do we have to spin with him? The Movie is unsuitable for people with epilepsy/vertigo or eye problems.There is nothing wrong with the clips of the actual event, you expect that to be grainy. It is an excellent film and very moving, but in my opinion spoilt by the poor cinematography.",Patriots Day
224,maldez,"Great movie with just 1 flaw... well, maybe 2",8,6 April 2017,"Patriots Day is an overall excellent movie in just about every area. It tells the story of the Boston bombings in fast-paced, well-acted fashion drawing you totally into the action. The scenes are well-constructed, the photography first-rate, the leading characters compelling.There was, however, one crucial moment in the film where it fell annoyingly, frustratingly short. The whole story of the Boston bombings hinges on how it was solved, and the climax of that solution should have been how, exactly, the investigative team determined that the guy in the white hat, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was one of the bombers. All we see is an agent looking at one of the sample videos who notices that the guy in the white hat was ""the only guy looking the other way"" shortly before the blast goes off. And with that simple, possibly random turn of Tsarnaev's head, the entire warehouse of agents, police and investigators spring into action because they know they got their guy.As a crime-show junkie, I would have liked to see much more of the investigative evolution that took place leading them to Tsarnaev, because it undoubtedly was much, much more than Tsarnaev simply looking the other way.How about including the guy in the hospital who actually looked into one of the bomber's eyes? The guy who scribbled a note from his hospital bed ""Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me""? You could easily devote 2 hours of a documentary exploring all of the evidence that was reviewed before finally leading to Tsarnaev, but this film took a huge short-cut and devoted about 30 seconds.But other than that flaw, a superior film that is highly recommended. Just be prepared for frustration if you're a forensics junkie like I am.Oh, and I have to mention the silliness of Mark Wahlberg's character, Tommy Saunders, showing up at every dramatic scene of the film, from the actual bombings, to finding the car the Tsarnaev brothers stole, to the finale where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is found hiding in the boat, good ol' Sergeant Tommy Saunders is there. Wahlberg does a great job of acting, but, come on, the guy's everywhere.",Patriots Day

It makes it so difficult to really listed to what the actors are saying. I agree with some of the other reviewers and their detail regarding the quality of this movie and the directing which I think crushed my expectations for this film. I feel a void after watching it where I wanted to be more connected with the victims with more of an understanding of their experiences, and those of the heroes that rose from this event. I am in anticipation of a remake of this story that corrects all the wrongs that this movie had done.

I admit I did not want to watch this movie when I first heard about it and saw some of the previews for it. In a way it kind of angers me that people want to make movies about these real life terroristic acts (especially against the USA). I feel as though it makes these evil ______ (fill in the blank with any cuss word you so choose) martyrs and brings unnecessary attention to terrorism. And oh look it's Mark Wahlberg in another movie about Boston what a surprise. But I was bored tonight and I do enjoy Mark Wahlberg in his natural habitat (Boston) associated movies, so I gave it a watch. I was blown away. I learned a lot more about the specific events of that tragedy than I originally knew. I thought the director did an excellent job of telling the story without using racism. I loved how they showed the investigation and how they set up the location where they conducted the investigation. I laughed, I cried, I was astounded at the action and fight scenes. It was wonderfully done. I just wish it wasn't true. And for the record, I'm a Flight Medic and NREMT for my local healthcare system so I appreciate when movies like this are well done.

228,nfirthpanetta,Good Film but Lacks Depth,7,18 March 2017,"There seem to be a lot of negative reviews for this movie because of an apparent mis-telling of the story or true story or hoax or whatever else people have said. As I'm not American, and have very little to do with American events (so hence have no context as to the truth or hoax or conspiracy or whatever of the Boston Marathon) I shall just stick to reviewing the movie for what it is: a movie.As a movie, they did a great job pulling it together. Mark Wahlberg plays his character perfectly. I have no idea if thats because of his acting ability, or if its more the fact that someone has yet again created a character that fits Mark Wahlberg to perfection. To be honest, it's probably the latter. Because of that, if you liked Deep Water Horizon then you'll probably like this because his acting is the same in both (which works fine because it's similar type of emotion and adrenaline you'd expect from both situations).The character spread was also well done. You got to see the impacting/impacted characters early on and had a nice transition between their development as the movie progressed.My only reservation about the film is that it pretty much gives you no explanation as to why the bombing even happened. Sure, it's easy for people to shout that it was terrorism or a hate crime, or done by hateful people, but that isn't an explanation. It might be true, but it's not an explanation, it's blatant ignorance which the world can no longer afford. This film could have benefited so much from shedding some light on the bombers motivation!!! To be honest, they were actually the one part that let this film down, Their storyline was wasted on surface level personality development and retracing of their steps throughout the event. Instead, the film should have used that time to instead show their motivation to commit the acts. This would have deepened their storyline and given the movie as a whole, a much richer and more stimulating story. In saying that, Themo Melikidze did a great job of making a believable character out of the little depth he was given.All in all this was a good film, however, it does lack the depth and backbone necessary for a second viewing.",Patriots Day
229,mcknz20,Emotional film of unity And courage through the people of Boston.,5,15 January 2017,"The Film ""Patriots Day (2016)"" is a tragic but true story that creates a seamless flow of real time and Re-enacted footage of the terrorist attack on Boston, which occurred on the 14th of April, 2013.The Acting was A-class (as expected) with the big names that came with it (Wahlberg, Goodman, Bacon, Monaghan and so on). The character relationships integrated well, you can feel the somewhat strained bonds between them and that adds to the emotions of the film experience. The action scenes were brilliantly executed with a ""natural and realistic"" feel too them which gave the films intensity.As someone who isn't from Boston nor the U.S, watching this film gave great clarity and depth to the events that occurred. This effect gives total props to the Director Peter Berg (Lone Survivor) and his co-writer Matt Cook (Triple 9)The final 10 minutes made the film all the more better and filled with emotional that tied the film in a special way (I'll let you see for your self!).However.... My initial thoughts were to question the necessity of the film. The events occurred not even 4 years ago, was it too soon? Was it completely necessary to convert to film? However since watching, this thought has yet to bother me again.Overall.. The resilience, strengths and unity among man/women was shown throughout this film, even in a time of crisis. This shows, that even when times are tough we can still band together as a society to help our fellow man and counter the destruction of terrorism.Great Film: 8/10",Patriots Day

But I don't go into more detail about that here, I rather recommend to go and see the film for yourself. It won't let you down and it is full of thrilling action and intense scenes. It goes through both what happens on the marathon and what happened to the victims of the attack after it, as well as what was going on with the terrorists who made the attack. It goes to points of view of many different people involved - runners, terrorists, police. But you have to see the film for yourself to get it!",Patriots Day

232,jacksonrees,Irresponsible and bad!,2,17 January 2017,"Mark Wahlberg is no patriot! This movie was irresponsible and should not have been allowed to be made. The fact that they dressed Mark up in a police costume and paraded him around the streets of Boston while there was a crisis happening is nothing short of disgraceful. How the movie crew got to Boston in time to film the live bombing, I am not sure. Did they plant the bomb, or simply know that it was going to go off? Either way, they should have alerted the proper authorities, but instead decided to call up Mark Wahlberg (well known for his stupendous performance as inventor Cade Yeager in Transformers: Age of Extinction) and dress him up as a Boston police officer, all the while parading him around the streets while people were dying. How the production company got off the hook for this obstruction of justice we cannot be certain. In any case, they should not have filmed the bombing for personal gain! Mark Wahlberg is despicable!

Moreover, some parts were the movie intentionally tried to prove that all you hear about Muslims in the media is 100% true so dont have any feeling to get to know them or believe that there are a good Muslims in the world which there is and the Majority of us is kind, people lovers and violence haters. In addition to that the part where the terror's wife said the the wife in Islam has to obey her husband or she will go to hell, without bringing the strange verses in the bible i can easily assure you that most religions has similar verses that no body pay attention to. In the end good conquers evil but evil here is not Islam like they tried to show. Evil is terrisosm despite what the terror race or religion ...hope you understand that one day!!",Patriots Day

252,jennyyanson,Come watch Mark Wahlberg complain about everything!!!!!,2,28 April 2017,"I'm gonna come out and say it in the beginning of my review. This was not a good movie. The only thing that was slightly interesting about it was it delved more into the bombers lives and what exactly they were thinking. But who honestly gives a crap about those losers right?! The movie was just one big giant rotating camera around Mark Wahlberg! His character was made up and all he did was complain the whole movie! So we've got Markie Mark bitching up a storm the entire movie and the Boston Police Department looking like a bunch of idiots. I'm not sure why you would want to paint the Boston PD in such a light but what I'm about to say could be considered a SPOILER. During the shoot out scene in Cambridge when they apprehend the first bomber the BPD is getting their butts kicked and yet one of the police officers yells out ""Welcome to Watertown!"" Are you kidding me? Later in the scene where they are trying to apprehend the second bomber in the boat the FBI move into position. 2 FBI agents move on top of a garage rooftop and they politely ask a woman police officer to move. In her most obnoxious Boston accent she says ""Who the F are youz guys?"" They reply we are the FBI. She says ""The Boston FBI?"" She then replies with ""this is my position and I'm not giving it up for Fn nobody!"" The FBI replies with ""Glad to have you mam but its about to get loud"" and she says ""like I Fn care!"" Please Lord have mercy tell me she didn't say that?! Where were the stories about Celeste Corcoran and her daughter, Sydney? Sydney was rescued when a Marine jumped on her and grabbed her femoral artery with his hand to save her life! Where were the stories about brothers J.P. and Paul Norden? Where was the continued story of Jessica and Patrick Downes? They showed a young couple in love before and during the bombing and then never showed them again! What about the mystery guy in the cowboy hat who saved so many people and helped so much?! I just simply don't know what this movie was trying to show or reflect.

262,kingb-80750,Patriots Day Review: Boston is Strong!,9,20 January 2017,"Peter Burg and Mark Wahlberg are back at it again, teaming up to bring us another fantastic movie in, ""Patriots Day"". Patriots Day is based on the Boston Marathon bombings that took place on April 15th, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. This heart warming drama does not just center around the star that is Mark Wahlberg and his character Tommy Saunders, a Boston police officer; it centers around multiple characters and tells this story from their point of view as well. This is by far one of the best films of the year and you will experience several different emotions while watching this film so strap your mood rings on and get ready to be enthralled by this emotional roller coaster ride!The story of Patriots Day rotates between a variety of different characters including investigators, survivors, and even the bombers themselves. You get to see the motivations of every character and see how the lives of the people centered around the bombing that day were affected. As events unfold prior, during, and after the bombing your heart will race as you start to feel for everyone involved. The direction of this movie is absolute genius and you can tell that this film was handled with the proper care, respect, and most importantly, class. Peter Burg was able to tell a gripping and compelling story that has you at the edge of your seat from start to finish; while taking you through a suspenseful investigation all at the same time. If this isn't brilliant directing then I'm not sure what is. This film has a variety of memorable scenes that you will remember long after you see the movie. By far the best scene in the film for me is after the events of the bombing and everyone is frantically trying to get a read on the situation, the protagonist, Tommy Saunders, returns home to collect his thoughts after what just transpired. His wife and family worried sick about him quickly swarm him as he walks through the door, asking several questions while giving him no room to breathe or think. Tommy is an emotional wreck at the moment and is not sure of how to feel or think when it comes to what he has just witnessed. He then proceeds to scream at the entire family and demands that they leave his home. As he finally gets to sit down and process what he just saw his wife Carol Saunders, played by Michelle Monaghan, goes to comfort him. During this seen Tommy completely breaks down in tears, describing the horrifying events that he just saw. This scene will move you without question and Mark Wahlberg's performance here automatically reels you in and prepares you for what the rest of the film has in store for you. Peter Burg shows his hand during this scene and at this point you are either in or your out with this movie and I was all in.Mark Wahlberg definitely has the best overall performance in the film but the supporting cast in this movie will hook you every moment they are on screen. Academy Award winner, J.K. Simmons turns in another great performance as Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, and you can't help but to keep your eyes glued to the screen when he's on it. John Goodman as Commissioner Ed Davis and Kevin Bacon as Special Agent Richard DesLauriers turn in great supporting performances as well. You completely buy the fact that these four men want and are going to catch the bombers at all costs because they believe in justice for all of Boston. And you cant help but cheer for them as they progress through their investigation. You can tell all of the actors bought into their roles and believed in the direction of Peter Burg because this movie relies on these performances and the film would have fell flat on it's face if the performances were not as stellar as they were.I was hypnotized during this film and was ready for the next scene every step of the way. The only real gripe I have with the film is the fact that I would have liked to have seen many more scenes with some of the supporting cast in the film. This is tough since the story already circles around many different characters but I could have definitely sat through another twenty minutes of this movie if it meant I got to see more of J.K. Simmons or John Goodman in action. With more screen time either of these two could be easily in the running for a best supporting actor nomination at the Oscars. However I feel that the film will make up for that because Peter Burg should be nominated for best director and I wont be surprised if this film is nominated for best picture. With all of that being said Patriots Day is a remarkably inspiring film, and also a very charming one at that. This film is a must see and ranks up there as one of the top ten films this year at a 9/10. I may not be from Boston but after watching this film I have a much better idea on what the true definition of what ""Boston Strong"" truly means.",Patriots Day
263,crystalwillette,"""Patriots Day"" reflects upon the tragic events in Boston, Massachusetts during the 2013 annual Boston Marathon.",7,13 January 2017,"Just so you know, I will be spoiling this movie, so if you haven't already seen it, please be advised to come back once you have seen it in full. I will be discussing many factors, such as the portrayal of characters, the plot, and the mood and tone of the film. So be warned, there are many, many spoilers involved. So as someone who is a resident of New England, and who lives not far from Boston, this movie may have impacted me in a way that is different that someone who lives in California or Florida. But regardless, I will not let my biases get in the way of this review. We see Mark Wahlberg portray a Boston Police Officer who is not only having problems with his job, but also having problems at home, which we later see may be due to the infertility of his wife. He is just a normal guy assigned to ""keeping the drunks away from the race"". Once the bombs go off though, his whole persona changes, and he is deeply affected by the events in question. He is sort of like a soldier who has been through war, and he cannot remove the images from his head. This particular addition to the movie shows how a normal police officer not only gets impacted heavily in times of tragedy, but mainly it shows how an officer during this tragic event was impacted. Another key factor to point out is the way the actors portray some of the survivors, showing dramatizations of their lives minutes before the bombs went off, again pressing that feeling of normality and how it only takes a second for everything to change. This is why this movie was quite eerie for me, because it's different to see it in the eyes of someone who was impacted directly, rather than just news coverage on the TV.Lastly, the main reason why it only got a 7/10 was due to the shootout scene towards the end. I honestly felt that it was poorly made, that it was more comedic than serious, and that it could have been done so much better. It almost reminded me of some comedy movie with a shootout scene in it. I think that if they had taken a different light to it, then it could have been done way better than it was. Overall the movie was quite good. I didn't get bored, and it kept my attention throughout the whole portion of it. Wahlberg did such a great job as well as all the other actors/actresses. As a Bostonian, it really shows how strong we are as not only a city, but a country as well. I would highly recommend this to anyone, it was such a great film.",Patriots Day
264,philohme,Gripping reminder of the tragic day,8,22 January 2017,"I had a close friend/coworker that finished the race 5 minutes before the bombing and his stories were mind-blowing. So I checked out this film and it does not disappoint. Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Nothing is so ridiculous that you would not believe it to be actually (close to) how it happened. There is an added bonus of it teaching you what to look for if you want to be vigilant in seeing impending terrorist attacks. In all, it makes you feel like you are there, but as multiple personalities from both sides of the good/evil line.

Don't know where to begin to start addressing this obvious piece of psyops shite. Those paid/extorted to produce this propaganda piece did give us (1) gigantic hint that it was a boatload of crap - akin to a rewrite of history itself. That hint was the inclusion of John Goodman in the cast. Why Goodman? Because Goodman was also in the cast of a ""based on real events movie"" about the FAKE MOVIE the government actually staged to get the hostages out of Iran in the 1970's. In it (Argo), Goodman played a key studio figure - who's main function to facilitate the government's deception - was to answer calls about the supposed ""actors"" & validate their status.

I was in the city to try to get a look at the Marathon finish line. Luckily I didn't get that close. I did see and hear the bombs go off. My God the blood was everywhere I could see that from even where I was standing. It was absolute chaos.This film is incredibly accurate. Mark Wahlberg's character is based on several police officers experiences. There are some trolls on here saying there was a political agenda or the facts are wrong in this film?? They are completely out of their minds. Not even a hint of it. Just the truth of what happened. I know I was there and I LIVED it. Nothing hinting left or right.I had the bad luck of working only a block away from where they captured the last terrorist in Watertown. I was stuck in our office sitting on the floor with State troopers giving us water bottles for like 12 hours. No one complained. The city was in lock down. I shouldn't have even been in work. When the police and FBI captured him people came out of their houses onto the streets clapping and celebrating as the police came by. It was a lovely thing to witness.
