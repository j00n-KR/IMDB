0,SAMTHEBESTEST,Sarpatta Parambarai promises too much in the first half just to become a BIG BORE in the second half. Same old Story survived by New regional conflicts.,6,22 July 2021,"Sarpatta Parambarai (2021) :
Movie Review -Pa. Ranjith's filmography doesn't offer anything extraordinary so expecting a sort of watchable flick from him shall be considered fine. However, Sarapatta suddenly started looking something better and overwhelming after the trailer so obviously people began to expect more from the same director who hasn't delivered a quality product yet. The movie does not surpass that unauthorised hype created by the trailer, but like I said, that typical Ranjith film, it fulfills that. You know, every sports drama has four stages- First Struggle and Training, Second Success and third is downfall and fourth is comeback. Sarapatta uses the same formula in same old manners with additional regional conflicts of honour and politics.Set during the 1980s, the film revolves around a clash between two clans namely Idiyappa Parambarai and Sarpatta Parambarai in North Chennai, which also showcases the boxing culture in the locality and also the politics being involved in it. There is nothing in the film which you haven't seen before in any classic or good sports drama. Although, the film actually looks sensational in the first half with terrific storytelling, it lacks the same effects in the second half. There is literally nothing in the story in the second half that can keep you hooked or interest you except for the boxing match scenes and that too comes with same old cliches. Remember Bollywood Movie 'Apne' (2007)? Just exclude family drama from it and you are almost here.The film is entirely carried by Arya but every actor in the film has given equally great performance. It is just a matter of screen space. Arya might be the frontier but Dushara Vijayan, Pasupathy, Kalaiyarasan, Santhosh Prathap, Anupama Kumar and Sanchana Natarajan are no less in their particular spaces. The music is highly engaging and tappy for the situations and thankfully none of them adds anything in the predictable boredom. And lyrics should be given equal credit for that.Sarapatta has one or two unexpected turnaround in the midway but that just goes without solid follow up. Ranjith could have had it trimmed, actually, that's one of the biggest reason why film is a big bore. Almost three hours for same old cliches, fair? Certainly not. 20 minutes were easily removable. Even few boxing sequences are shot childishly or better say are edited in such manners. It's 2021, not 1991 to make such noticeable blunders, especially when the main context the film depends on it. Overall, Sarapatta Parambarai is surely watchable for good performances and cliched story of an underdog blended with regional conflicts but just don't expect anything outstanding.RATING - 6/10*",Sarpatta Parambarai
1,arungeorge13,Pa.Ranjith is back with a winner! [+74%],7,24 July 2021,"Pa. Ranjith's latest film ticks almost everything you expect from the man: there's racy action (in the form of impressively staged boxing bouts), social commentary on the issues of the '70s North Madras working class and their warring communities, well-etched lead characters, and frames filled hordes of people. Arya slips into the role of Kabilan (a labourer-turned-boxer) with ease, his physique the perfect add-on. While he's red-hot in the action sequences, his performance is found slightly wanting in the ultra-emotional ones. There's solid reason why Ranjith stages the film in the '70s: characters (and even entire communities) are affected by the happenings of the times.Solid supporting acts form the backbone of the film. Be it Pasupathy (as Coach Rangan), Shabeer Kallarakkal (as Dancing Rose, with an intriguing demeanour), John Kokken (as Vembuli, Kabilan's unbeaten nemesis), John Vijay (as the Anglo-Indian Daddy, his mixed dialect adding to the fun), and Dushara Vijayan (as Mariyamma, Kabilan's wife who struggles to keep him in check). Cinematography by Murali G often gives you the spectatorial perspective - that feeling of sitting amid packed, cheering crowds. While the 2h 53m run-time may look worrying, not a single scene is unengaging. Even Kabilan's gangster turn is portrayed in the form of a long montage using frequent jump-cuts. In another film, it would have required an entire hour.The biggest difference-maker here is that the coach character isn't the typical one you'd see in regular sports films. He's philosophical in his approach, but also tactical. The dynamic between coach and pupil is wonderfully picturized. The plot and its intricacies are mostly on-point, except for a few random attack scenes that come off as lazy. Kalaiyarasan's character (coach Rangan's son) is a bit too conflicting and his transitions (from cunning to considerate) in the film feel more abrupt than organic. In Sarpatta Parambarai, Ranjith makes an effort to let us know how boxing became the favourite sport of North Madras and eventually, a determinant of the protagonists' lives. SaNa's pulsating musical score adds zing, especially to the action scenes.",Sarpatta Parambarai
2,santhosh-10290,Sarpatta Parambarai,10,22 July 2021,Excellent Movie. Everybody acted well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie were excellent. The movie was so interesting and thrilling. This is one of the Best Tamil Movie of 2021. Excellent Movie.,Sarpatta Parambarai

4,ketgup83,Electrifying Boxing Drama That Creates Magic With Brilliant Performances,9,25 July 2021,"Last week , we witnessed the Farhan AKhtar's Toofan which showed the making of a champion while this week's release is yet another boxing tale involving the clash of clan during the 70's era.Sarpatta Parambarai introduces us to the world of boxing when people of Madras were crazy about the sports during the 70's era. However, for Sarpatta and Idiyappa clans, it was more than the boxing - it was the pride of making clan win in the ring.Directed by Pa Ranjith (Kabali and Kaala), the very first scene of Sarpatta Parambarai when the factory workers leave everything the moment alarm triggers announcing the beginning of the boxing event shows the culture and the mania that has gripped the people of Madras for the challenging sports. We are immediately introduced to the character of Kabilan who is passionate about boxing but never get the chance to prove himself. As the coach of Sarpatta gets the challenge from the rival clan after the defeat, he choses Kabilan who work tirelessly to bring down the undefeated champion Vembuli. Like other boxing flicks, Sarpatta Parambarai also shows how the once popular Kabilan gets shadowed under wrath of revengeful act, alcoholism and petty crime. Despite all odds, he makes a comeback and does it best with the a crucial boxing climax scene. I also loved the fight scene between Dancing Rose (Shabeer Kallarakkal) and Kabilan which is brilliantly choreographed that you want to keep watching it again and again.Sarpatta Parambarai does suffer from duration which is close to 2 hours 53 minutes that does not favor the momentum it builds up initially. Also, the screenplay suffers with a predictable climax, though saved by a good punch in the end. However, the beautiful art direction by T Ramalingam and astonishing camera work by Murali G. Transforms you the world of Madras during the 70's era along with superb background score by Santhosh Narayanan.Sarpatta Parambarai is enhanced with a very good characters performances. Arya as Kabilan steals the show and performs the role as it was tailor-made for him. Ditto for Pasupathu who plays Kabilan's coach, Dushara Vijayan as Mariamma and John Vijay as Daddy who brings value to the boxing drama.Overall, Sarpatta Parambarai is probably one of the best sports drama ever to come out in Indian Cinema which gives a knockout performance. Excellent 3.5/5.The boxing drama is produced by Neelam Productions and K9 studios and is currently streaming on Amazon prime.",Sarpatta Parambarai
5,djurrepower,"some fresh air, but not that good",5,15 August 2021,"As someone who gets tired from american movie from time to time, this movie is pretty digestable for an eastern movie. Story was understandable and most curtural differences weren't that disruptive.That being said, from a technical standpoint this movie does not perform. Most camerawork is fine, but editing looked rough. ADR was pretty noticable throughout the whole movie, and acting was passable but mostly sub par. Also, for a 3 hour movie this film has a lot of pacing issues. We get to see 3 different training montages for example, wich is just too much. And most of the story felt jarring and not streamlined at all.So all in all, it was felt like some fresh air, but from a cinematic standpoint not really a good movie.5/10: fun for once, but nah.",Sarpatta Parambarai
6,saru2020,An unexpected one from the director,8,1 August 2021,"A unexpected one from the director. One could never imagine how a director like Ranjith could make a film like this although he hasn't left his signature of making it in the suburbs.The film stands strong on the boxing arena by taking us back to 1980s and it does make us feel like living there for bits and pieces with so many environment, mannersims & stylings that the film portrays. The clash b/w 2 clans were shown very well in the broad light and was very evident throughout the film but the film for most part travels with multi layered characters and doesn't show well establishment of any of its characters which makes it the huge flaw just like other films of the director.More than the climax fight, it was the match b/w Arya & Rose which stood out very well and after the climax, the director's unusual way of showing everything in a positive light did stand out as well.There are so many flaws just like the director's other films has and main one being: not giving a finish to any of the characters, leaving us feeling like having watching something incomplete or half baked.",Sarpatta Parambarai
7,vjnambu,Well made sports political period drama,8,2 August 2021,"In 1970's tamilnadu, there were two boxing clans- Sarpattai and idiyappa. Sarpattai clan is struggling in boxing as the boxers are all getting beaten up by idiyappa's star boxer vembuli(john kokken). Kabilan(arya) from Sarpattai clan is very much interested in boxing but his mother is against it because his father was a boxer and turned into a goon getting killed by his enemies. That's why her mother fears his son going his father's path.Sarpattai coach rangan(pasupathy) challenges vembuli for a match and if Sarpattai loses then rangan will quit teaching boxing. Rangan's son vetriselvan wants to contest but rangan rejects him as he is reckless and doesn't have the skill to fight vembuli. So he chooses another student raman to fight vembuli. Raman feels uncomfortable training with rangan so he hires another coach for the match which upsets, and at this moment kabilan rises for rangan and challenges Raman for sparring. Kabilan knocks raman down and later idiyappa clan's dancing rose to fight vembuli. Raman's uncle thaniga offers help to vembuli in the match if he is unable to beat kabilan. Vembuli initially refuses, but during match when he was getting beaten up by kabilan, he gives a sign to thaniga for help who creates a ruckus during the match and stabs kabilan at back. Rangan gets arrested as he is active in dmk govt which collapses during emergency.After rangan is jailed, kabilan injures thaniga and is imprisoned temporarily. After getting released, he and vetriselvan starts arrack business, where kabilan turns into a drunkard and goon like his father. One day when Kabilan is attacked by some goons in front of his wife and child, kabilan decides to change his ways. After rangan gets released, kabilan returns to him for boxing but rangan disowns him as he went wayward. Despite rangan abandoning him, kabilan decides to fight vembuli. Vembuli also agrees as audience humilated him that he lost that match against kabilan. Kabilan's mother sends him to former boxer beedi rayappan for training. Rest of the film is whether kabilan beats vembuli or not.Sarpattai parambarai is not just about boxing but more than that. It has subtle political stand, and sets the 1970s Madras during emergency period well. Most of the characters are also interesting. I liked john vijay's daddy, pasupathy's rangan and dancing rose characters. Vetriselvan is also a complex character. The heroine resembles bhumi pednekar in some angles. All actors performed well.The drawbacks i felt was that it has various clichés of a boxing film like how an inexperienced kabilan beats down trained boxers. Another drawback I felt was regarding arya's appearance. His character is from slums but he his fair and glowing skin and well dressed costumes don't make you believe him as a slumboy. Also, in the unfit portions its clearly visible that he used prosthetic for a potbelly. His ripped physique is awesome.On the whole Sarpattai parambarai is long but well made sports political period drama. After the disappointing kabali and kaala, pa ranjith is back in form.",Sarpatta Parambarai
8,aastikhimta,A great sports movie,9,8 September 2021,The plot was actually great and it shows how our Indian movies should be . Lead performed his role nicely. There were some fine twists and I never got bored while watching this movie. This movie will be having a scenario of 1970's and Madras boxing competitions. Rest you'll get to know when you'll watch this movie. Ending was fine too.,Sarpatta Parambarai
9,ragingbull_2005,World class cinema,7,13 August 2021,"There are two new movies on boxing that are streaming on Prime and it is inevitable that both would be compared with each other. I have one suggestion to the cast and crew of Toofan, that they should hang up their gloves, once and for all.Sarpatta is a length film, clocking at 170 minutes. To me, it seemed like two different movies.The first one that lasts till intermission is 90 minutes long and is mind-blowing. It is humbling to see such world class cinema come out from India. These 90 minutes for me rank amongst the best cinema on boxing, of all time and stand their ground against all time classics such as Raging Bull, Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. They are populated by unforgettable characters, moored by their societal roots. There is an element of caste consciousness and strong over current of discrimination. The boxing scenes are shot brilliantly. As I wrote earlier, this is too notch and can be compared with any boxing film of any time.The second half was a let down for me. It ticked all the suspected boxes, which was a let down and ended predictably. It seemed like the effort of lazy writing.The director, Pa Ranjith, gives a masterclass of sense and time. It is the screenplay of the first half, which has so many unforgettable scenes and interactions between real world characters that is the hero. But it's banality in the second half also makes it the unintended villain.Still this is very highly recommended. It might be India's entry to the Oscars and if that happens, it would be worthy of that laurel.",Sarpatta Parambarai
10,sriramthestranger,Period Sports Drama!!,7,22 July 2021,"After a long time, it seems Pa. Ranjith got his mojo back. The screenplay and character introduction and motives are well established like 'Madras'. However, though the narration progresses like a 'one-on-one battle between hero and arch rival', there is a brilliant shift of character in the 2nd half. The climax ends like a typical sports drama, and special mention to 'Dancing Rose' and boxing choreography. You will like it if you have liked previous Pa. Ranjith movies.",Sarpatta Parambarai
11,madhukar30,"Director Ranjit, Take a bow, Sir !!",8,23 July 2021,"What a comeback, it's been for director Pa. Ranjit, after a great start to his career with films like Attakathi and Madras and losing his way while collaborating with a big star for two lacklustre movies. Ranjit fires on all cylinders, and against all odds to deliver something that has never been delivered to Tamil cinema audiences, a perfect sports drama. Sarpatta Parambarai doesn't have a parallel in the history of Tamil cinema, where the directors usually stick their guns to, age old proven formula laced movies or dud mass entertainers , they very rarely stick out to experiment anything with a substance. Sarpatta Parambarai, delivers not only the substance, but along with it a sting too. The movie not only focuses on the Madras boxing scene in the late 1970s, it also highlights the politics, rivalry, relationships, infrastructure and things at stake during those times. Using Indira Gandhi's emergency as a backdrop within the story is a classic touch indeed.Cinematography is terrific, highly detailed 4K visuals presented in 1:1.85:1 ratio is just perfect for home audiences. Screenplay is fantastically written with so many vibrant characters. I don't think I have seen a Tamil movie with so many characters that are colourful and equally important after Kamal Hassan's Virumandi. Production design just is top class for a Tamil movie, costumes and makeup are highly convincing and excel throughout the movie. Editing is again, fantastic, as the editor doesn't let the pace and intensity drop for a major portion of the movie that has a runtime of a whopping 174 minutes. Santosh Narayan's Background score is apt and doesn't not overshadow Ranjit's hard work. Watch out for the song when the end credits roll.It has been a long time in Tamil cinema where the whole cast has collectively delivered strong acting performances to match Sarpatta Parambarai's quality. The stand out performers in the supporting roles are led by, John Viyay as Kevin/Daddy, Kalaiarasan as Vetriselvan and Pashupathy as Rangan Vaathiyaar. The Rival boxers John Kokken as Vembuli, Santosh Pratap as Raman and Sabeer K as dancing rose too play their parts convincingly. Arya is definitely a much improved actor since Mahamuni, and his acting performance and bodily transformation adds a lot of positives to his career. Even Dushara as wife and Anupama Kumar as the mother have delivered wonderful performances.Overall, Sarpatta Parambarai has a lot of things to work in its favour, be it the Treatment, Quality, characters, acting performances and a wonderful storyline that will make this movie a cult classic. Sarpatta Parambarai will not only end up just as a much loved film, it will carve a place of its own in the history of Tamil cinema and be remembered for a very long time. The movie is Highly Recommended for audiences all over the world, yes it's bit lengthy on the runtime but rest assured the story is packed with lots of vibrant characters and fireworks to keep the movie interesting for, almost its entire duration, I wish it was a 15 minutes shorter. But I am sure that Sarpatta Parambarai will definitely walk into the the hall of fame of Tamil cinema, maybe Indian cinema. It's a shame that movie couldn't make it to cinemas due to the pandemic. Thanks to Amazon prime for delivering it home. 8.0 stars out of 10 for a movie that replicates fifteen rounds of boxing in its storyline & filmmaking. Two Thumbs Up.",Sarpatta Parambarai

RECOMMENDEDSuperb sports drama with very hard work in all aspects.

13,nidhunmoviebuff,Best boxing film since Irudhi Suttru!,8,23 July 2021,"Sarpatta Parambarai is all that Toofan aspired to be and so much more. A well rounded, rustic yet impactful sports drama, it hits all the right notes in a compelling narration, accentuated by a superb lead performance from Arya.The movie tells the story of Kabilan, a blue collar laborer who is also a boxing aficionado and an ardent fan of the legendary coach Rangan (Pasupathy). Despite his mother's misgivings, Kabilian eventually takes up gloves himself and how the sport offers him a path to findinng purpose and redemption forms the rest of the story.Pa Ranjith delivers his career-best work after Madras (2014), sketching a painstakingly detailed canvas of 1980s Madras, filled with the caste and class politics of the time.Every supporting character is well written and perfectly cast. Anupama Kumar as the strict mother, Dushara Vijay as the ever-suffering wife and John Vijay as the trusty advisor steal the show in several sequences.The best thing about Arya is that he understands his limitations as an actor and uses his physique to overcome the same. The boxing sequences are expertly shot and Farhan Akthar and Bollywood should learn from Sarpatta as to how to capture the essence of pugilistic arts.Ultimately, Sarpatta effectively buys you into the storyline of an aimless youngster and how he finds himself only to get derailed on his journey and how he claws his way back.Pa Ranjith shows us that the classic tale of the underdog, when told right and with heart, can still capture hearts everywhere.Recommended!",Sarpatta Parambarai
14,TreeFiddy53,"Great first half, was a drag beyond that.",7,22 July 2021,"The downside of doing a boxing movie is there have been several movies before, so what story can you come up with that's new? The first half of this 3hr movie makes you feel like this would be different, but things go downhill after 1.5 hrs, after which, it ends up becoming any other generic boxing movie.The acting was really good by the cast overall, my pick of the lot was John Vijay (Remember Son of Gun from Oram Po?) Great set-design for a period drama, decent music and boxing choreography.This had the potential to be so much more, but I don't think the film lived up to its potential. Too long, too much going on. Toofan was a let down, so was this, but maybe that's just me.If you like a ripped Arya, some good acting + a fast paced first half and don't mind if the 2nd half lets you down, check it out.",Sarpatta Parambarai
15,mynameritesh,A remarkable sports drama entertainer.,9,22 July 2021,"Sarpatta Parambarai is a truly striking sports drama that punches above its weight. Besides being a raw and brutal sports drama, this is an intimidating tale of a man's true search for identity, his adversities, his seek for mother's validation, and his own redemption. The Boxing Clan rivalry in Madras in the 1980s is beautifully captured. Courtesy of Arya's unswerving performance, Santosh Narayanan's outstanding score, and PA Ranjith's masterful direction this 3-hour long film doesn't lose its grip and keeps you engaged till the end. A remarkable sports drama entertainer.",Sarpatta Parambarai

19,kumarankulam,Pa. Ranjith's Sarpatta Parambarai is one of the well-made sports drama-packed up with excellent performances and a strong technical crew,9,27 July 2021,"Tamil cinema has produced a couple of sports films in the past few decades. It's questionable whether these films did justice to the actual sport because most of our films are stick with the usual commercial formula which overshadows the use of the sport in the film. In fact, it only becomes a subplot like in M. Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi and Ghilli. Pa. Ranjith's recent release Sarpatta Parambarai breaks all the stereotypical interpretations of sports in films and stands as a very unique sports drama ever made in Tamil cinema. Sarpatta Parambarai is all about boxing. Starting from its visually pleasing setup, the film is set in the 1970s. Pa. Ranjith doesn't use any conventional elements to make it a period film. He uses the characters to identify the period which proves his brilliant filmmaking skills. The biggest strength of Sarpatta Parambarai is the characters. None of the characters are perfect. They have all their own weaknesses and strengths which makes them relatable and connective with the audience. Each and every one of the cast has performed their role to the extent where they are irreplaceable by any other actors. They have all a scope to perform as well as to contribute to the main protagonist, Kabilan's journey. Arya's performance as Kabilan is very intense and realistic. He has portrayed the role with the heart and soul. He has dedicated himself to the film which can be seen through his physical transformation. This is by far one of the most defining characters that he had played ever since Naan Kadavul and Madrasapattinam. I can't speak about a particular scene to justify his exceptional performance because he has shouldered the whole film with his acting prowess. Another performance that blew my mind was the one of Pasupathy. There's no doubt to say that Pasupathy is the heart and soul of Sarpatta Parambarai. He plays his character with so much emotion, dignity, and love. The scenes that he appears in remain fresh because of his presence on screen and his performance. He is undoubtedly one of the best-supporting actors in Tamil cinema. On the other side, we have a unique performance from Dushara Vijayan who plays her role with such ease. She convinces us that she is the perfect match for the role with her beautiful performance. We have other prominent supporting actors like John Vijay, Kalaiyarasan, John Kokken, and Shabeer Kallarakkal who shined in their roles respectively. A special mention for Shabeer Kallarakkal's Dancing Rose character will definitely win your heart. Besides the extraordinary performances from the cast, we have a very strong technical team who made sure that Sarpatta Parambarai stays true to its genre and backdrop. From the cinematography to the editing, Sarpatta Parambarai shines in its own way. Santhosh Narayanan's background score gives life to the film. The emotional and cherishable moments are soulfully connected by his intense background score. Kudos to Neeye Olli and Vambula Thumbula. This sports drama envisions the pride of boxing and the honor of playing for the happiness of the people. Sarpatta Parambarai has a predictable story but it's the presentation that makes it overwhelming. Pa. Ranjith is known for presenting his films in a way that it connects with the audience. The emotions dealt with by the characters and their personal conflicts make us relate to them. The realism that Pa. Ranjith incorporates in this sports drama is the major element that brings to the world of Sarpatta. Unlike the usual sports films that we have seen in Tamil cinema, Sarpatta Parambarai is in a very different flavor because it deals deeply with a character's journey. There are no unnecessary subplots nor songs to slow down the pace of the film. It's actually true that the film is long and slow but after the climax, it's a worth watching experience. After making two films in a row with Rajinikanth, Pa. Ranjith seems to have worked in a film where he doesn't have the need to make it fit a star's image for the commercial viability. His previous films Madras and Kaala dealt with strong political ideologies and caste issues. In Kabali, he spoke boldly about the low-class people's life and their struggles to grow bigger in society. In contrast to these films, he presented only a few political traits this film to bring the feel of the 70s. For example, he used the pictures of notable political leaders of Tamil Nadu to connect the audience with the period of the film. This filmmaking style is unique compared to the other period films that we have seen so far. Pa. Ranjith proves once again that he is a filmmaker who has a vision and a goal to achieve. Through Sarpatta Parambarai, Pa. Ranjith presents the value of relationships: husband and wife, mother and son & teacher and student. He valorizes boxing by giving the sport value. It's not just a sport but an emotion. Overall, Pa. Ranjith's Sarpatta Parambarai is one of the well-made sports drama-packed up with excellent performances and a strong technical crew.",Sarpatta Parambarai
20,grarunkumar1994,Spectacular !!,10,23 July 2021,"Pa Ranjith may have had strong politics in all his movies but recent ones were boring, uninspiring and plain emotionless. This is the return of Pa Ranjith who made ""Madras"".'Sarpatta Parambarai' is not just another sports drama. This has everything needed for a classic film. An underdog who struggled all his life, a coach who believed in him, haters within his clan and the antagonists.Arya does shine in this film as Kabilan, the protagonist who is looked down upon by the society thanks to his caste ( shown symbolically with dialogues and Ambedkar's poster) and his mother's hatred towards boxing that killed his father. As usual, there is a fitness montage and a fat to fit transformation.Pasupathi is at his best in a role that he brilliantly portrayed as Rangan vadyar (coach Rangan). His body language and acting prowess is the main pillar of the film despite Arya being the main protagonist. At times even we join Kabilan's path in finding out what impresses him and what his reactions are. This is the actor we loved in films like Virumandi.Though the main rivalry between Sarpatta and Idiyappa clan, the ultimate fight of Kabilan vs Vembuli being the major plot target, one man that stays in the mind is 'Dancing Rose' the boxer who flies like the wind, flips inside the ring like a capoeira fighter and stands as a true sportsman even criticized his own men for cheating. Shabeer was made to play Rose. This deserves a standalone film.Overall Sarpatta Parambarai is a bit lengthy yet extremely entertaining with proper character depth and strong story.",Sarpatta Parambarai

23,alphadude007,"Interesting, but seems like a lost opportunity",6,22 July 2021,"This is definitely a good watchable movie, but feels like it under delivered given the world building and characters the director had at his disposal. The writing and character development is all over the place. Like protagonists who have been staunchly believing in something change their beliefs without any undue reason or logic just cos the story demands it. Arya is great as a boxer and looks the part, but his acting skills when it comes to emotional scenes are found wanting. The rival boxer is just not up to the mark. The best character was dancing rose and that was the best fight in the movie. Definitely watchable, but seems like a missed opportunity to make something even larger and impactful.",Sarpatta Parambarai
24,maruthuk-21470,What a comeback by Director Ranjith!,8,25 July 2021,"First of all, thanks to director Pa Ranjith for trying out a different genre and coming out trumps in it, would say he has got old magic and mojo back, second best movie for him after Madras. It's a teamwork and everybody has given their level best, in particular performances of Arya, Kalaiyarasan, John Kokken and Pasupathy, but standout performer of the entire movie is Shabeer Kallarakkal as Dancing Rose. 👏👌👍 His mannerisms, reactions and dance steps in the boxing ring still lingering in my eyes, way to go Shabeer and wish you all the very best! Acting of GM Sundar and Vettai Muthukumar is also too good. It's really hard to make period movies like this, thanks to art director Ramalingam for his excellent work and he has brought age old Chennai in front of us. 👏👌👍Background music of Santhosh Narayanan is also too good! In the second half there were lots of liquor drinking and violent scenes, could have been better avoided, it slows down the pace of the movie as well, that's the only reason for giving 8 stars, otherwise would have given perfect 10! Wish director Ranjith keeps trying something new like this, as he is very good at it! 👍",Sarpatta Parambarai

26,AnirudhGod,Rousing Sports Drama!,8,29 July 2021,"Pa. Ranjith is a filmmaker that just keeps making film after film, and they keep improving in quality. This is no different. This film has tremendous level of conflict, and the hero is the underdog who rises up to the top. And the journey is very moving. Albeit overlong, the film manages to tell an interesting tale of a man doing his best to honour his clan, his family, and more importantly, himself. The sequences of boxing are pretty exciting, and the music pretty gentle. I really liked it.",Sarpatta Parambarai
27,sudheeshthulaseedharan,This is not just a boxing movie created with a single hero concept.,8,25 October 2021,"This is not just a boxing movie created with a single hero concept.The film is set in the 1970s and '80s, adorned with Madras-style artwork, casting of each characters and performance in the film are perfectly fit.The presentation is such that all the actors become the heroines of the film with their performances. Therefore, even characters with a negative atmosphere have a head start in this movie.Kabilan in this movie has topped all the character performances in Arya's career best films.Most of the characters in the film will be remembered, including Vempuli, Raman, Dancing Rose, Vadhyar, Daddy, Meeran, Vetri, Kabilan's mother and wife Mariamma.Not only does it tell the story of the boxing matches that once existed in Madras, but it also tells the story by connecting the political and social systems of the time.

28,TheV2,Great characters in a true sports movie,9,28 July 2021,"Sarpatta Parambarai is an excellent sports drama - probably the greatest in Tamil cinema so far. On top of that this movie was carried by amazing characters and the cast's fantastic acting.This is the simple story of Kabilan wanting to beat Idiyappa's monstrous boxer Vembuli to regain the Sarpatta's reputation. Every single character's desire forms an additional roadblock. I hate the word ""perfect"", but that's the most fitting expression for the characterization in this movie.Another amazing soundtrack by Santhosh Narayanan. The cinematography and editing made this movie surpass the usual sports movies. I can't judge the realism, but because of the excellent cuts it doesn't matter. The balance between the emotions, the rawness, the characters' own touch and the suspense was near-perfect.And this was consistent throughout the whole movie. Yes, every match was important - a true sports movie. My only little complaint was that a portion of the movie felt a little bit rushed (probably because of the length). Well, maybe there's hope for an extended version?This is an almost perfectly balanced masterpiece by Pa. Ranjith and in my opinion by far his best work. Hopefully a foundation for future sports dramas.",Sarpatta Parambarai

You can do it "" .To others it's just an character - To me it's an emotion .I Don't know why thalapathy vijay rejected this script .

Its an absolute delight to watch it on for like 174 mins. It never felts like around 3 hours. The way Ranjith writing screenplay for his movies is still an amazed one. Arya's career be(a)st performance. He needs to search his roles like this to prove he is an immense performer. Pasubathy is lit. He is actually a gem actor who do any roles to make an impact with us. John Vijay is an easy scorer as always, here he attracts us all with his daddy role. I still get amazed that how they find an actor for the dancing rose character, he is negative role in this film but still we liked him is his victory here. We can talk about all the characters all dy, because this movie is not a part for main lead while all the characters are written well with intense depths. There is no flaws here. Santosh Narayanan works are very impressive these days. He is upgrading himself by doing what the movie needs. Everyone is perfect. I never felt like this before in recent times.

Ranjith films.DOP is so fresh it's a sight for sore eyes.Writing is perfect.Pa. Ranjith as usual exploited the aspect of class struggle and represented it in much more artistic way than he did with his earlier movies.Watch out for kabalin and dancing rose bout it's most stylish representation of kick boxing ever.Captured the soul of what boxing is ""it's not about victory it's about keeping up the fight""

41,Vikky0007,Somewhat caricaturish but ok to watch,7,8 August 2021,Didnt feel like I was watching a masterpiece but was interesting in parts. Acting seemed good mostly but I felt some overacting too. Movie was a bit loud for my taste with all kinds of sounds and a bit over the top performance. My benchmark when it comes to south Indian movies are the likes of Kumbalangi Nights and Super Deluxe.

Director Pa. Ranjith creates a world full of characters with flesh and blood. Sarpatta Parambari, is one of the best boxing films India has produced in term of story and screenplay. Arya nailed it as Kabilan, an amateur boxer who is prohibited to do boxing because of his mother. His physique, his performance is extremely eye catching. Pasupathy, as Kabilan's boxing coach is natural. Anupama Kumar as Kabilan's mother & Dushara Vijayan as Kabilan's wife are delight to watch. All the actors have portrayed their character very well.One thing I loved about this movie was the boxing choreography, the way camera moves makes us feel we are watching it live in the ring. The background score is extremely pleasure to hear. Street fight scenes are extremely well presented, hats off the the director and the editor.

63,rahuljnu-62268,"Awesome masterpiece, un chef d' oeuvre.",10,30 July 2021,"'Sarpatta Parambarai' was a delightful film and is probably Pa Ranjith's best. It was unbelievable how the films works well on so many levels - boxing drama, socio-cultural documentation, commentary on Tamilnadu politics during emergency and in-between all this, Ranjith also manages to infuse his own metaphorical take on the Dravidian politics.'Sarpatta Parambarai' could easily be the most cohesive Tamil film where so many characters with contradicting motives remain remarkable irrespective of their screen time. It is extraordinary how the few dozen memorable characters and the lovely North Madras Tamil they speak stays with us.While the film claims to follow the ups and downs of Kabilan, I somehow felt that Ranjith was more obsessed with Rangan Vaathiyar (played by the Pasupathy), to an extent I think he might be the film's protagonist. Which is why the film is terrific and almost flawless until Rangan Vaathiyaar is arrested. Because till then, we follow his emotional curve and Kabilan is still only in Rangan's shadows.After Rangan's arrest, the film follows the fall and rise of Kabilan and I felt this was probably the weakest part of the film. Because Rangan has now disappeared and the film is also told to us through a series of factual news details. At best, we only see this phase through Mariamma's emotional turmoil.But once Rangan returns, the film gets back to form. And it now balances the emotional graphs of both Rangan and Kabilan. And takes us to the climatic high.It was also interesting to see how Ranjith's filmmaking style in 'Sarpatta Parambarai' is a lot different from his earlier works. For the first time, he allows the cinematography of Murali to be a little flamboyant unlike the restrain shown in the previous ones. While the art design and costumes impeccably capture the North Madras of the 70s, they are also dramatically colourful here. But the big surprise was how Santosh Narayanan has been asked to take the back seat. The music is only sparingly used.And I have no doubts about the fact that Ranjith might have struggled working with Arya. Because while the actor's body might be perfect for the onstage action performances, his acting skills offstage weren't helping much. His poor acting is closely followed by Anupama Kumar playing his mother's character. These two choices were slightly surprising because Ranjith's casting is generally flawless. Which we witness here as well in the other two dozen characters.But the film works well in spite of these issues because of the brilliant writing and the dramatic staging. And Tamil Prabha's writing adds ample strength to Ranjith's cinematic world.I hope it would be appropriate to repeat Beedi thatha's lines here - (Victory is not about winning once. But about continuously fighting!) Because Ranjith marubadiyum gelichitaaru!",Sarpatta Parambarai

68,Buttsludge,A bullet point structure-less analyzation of strength and weakness,7,10 September 2021,"Strengths :
Barbaric fight scenes.Compelling story.Drama and interaction between characters.Character identity.Ebb and flow of the story.Not too gory.Beautiful shots of architecture and landscape.Good cinematography.Humorous moments are there to revamp the story not quite gut busting funny and overplayed.Story pulls you in and carries you along though the run time might cause some to drift off.Music is good and suits the cultural tone of the movie without sounding overly stereotypical.A hint of mystery, romance.Fight scenes are great and build up imposing characters sense of suspense.Bright vivid colors , (not boring to look at) and lots of different costume design that feels true to form.You can see the different fighters styles without them being over the top
does a good job making characters feel imposing but not overpowered.Though it doesn't matter to me personally , i know there exists a set of people that care whether or not the blood in movies looks real or fake
they will be happy to hear that the blood effects here look rather convincingThis is viewer friendly for people that just want to watch a fight movie and not see utter violence and a good choice in my opinion,
too much gore could have cheapened the film or made it cheesy and i think they chose the right amount.The final fight is evenhanded and doesn't make the protagonist feel like they have plot armor.Both opponents take a beating and fight til they can barely stand anymore
The acting along the way is convincing.Weaknesses:
A bit too many characters.Might be better on repeat viewings than the first view as there's a lot going on.Feels a little bit like the legend of the drunken master in how the protagonist is forbidden to fight by a parent.Music/ dance scene feels kind of out of place and forced in but isn't boring to watch
Some of the sound effects during fight scenes, like a boxer hitting their gloves together, or the whooshing of air during punches sound stock.I felt myself becoming a little worn out half way through, but it wasn't too long before a big fight scene drew me back in.There is a little bit of gore including weapons, but it is shot in a minimal way.Does a good job using audio to simulate the disorientation fighters feel, but I feel they could have used quick zoom in /zoom outs to get light-bleeding and jar the viewer better to maintain the effect visually as well.The movie doesn't offer much for an ending, preferring to end on the highpoint right after the fight and I don't know if this is the right choice or not. It kind of feels like there should be a big celebration afterwards to me.To summarize this was an entertaining watch. There was a coherent and interesting story, well developed characters and motivations and only a couple cohesion breaks such as the forced in dance scene.The sheer run time might turn some potential viewers away but if you have the time it's worth checking out. I do think that the 8.8 average is sort of high and feel more comfortable giving this a 7.4 rounded down to 7.Did I enjoy it? Yes fairly so
Would I watch it again? Perhaps in a few years, (due mostly to length)",Sarpatta Parambarai

71,ashishb524,Better than Madras.,7,22 July 2021,"I was not interested in watching this as Pa. Ranjith's films are deep in these caste and community stuff. I don't understand that clearly. Even while watching this film I only watched it in cinematic way and that's it.The first half of the film ends at a point which I thought is the whole film is about. But then the set up made in the beginning and it's paybacks are clearly used in the second half of the film. There are many points to talk about this film but the acting of both the lead and the supporting cast are just wonderful. I can't talk about the historical accuracies as I don't know a single thing about that but I can see it's done with detail. Editing is done well but sometimes I felt that it was going too fast and choppy.I usually don't like a leader/ gangster/ hero/ thug, etc going downhill shown in the movies like The godfather 2, Scarface, many more. I mean I like the above mentioned movies it's just that I'm fed up. You see, a guy becoming big and then due to his arrogance coming down as fast as he went up. That troupe is getting repeated and I'm getting sick of it. Thankfully it was just there for about 20 minutes in the movie.This is really well rounded film. The story is solid, music is good (I never even heard that there's music, that shows it achieved its work), acting is brilliant, casting is done right, back-stories are there and are apt to the story.I can just watch a straight movie made on the back story of ""Daddy"" alone. It's just a beauty. Those dialogues, that slang, that English. Loved that character.",Sarpatta Parambarai

The success you achieve after failing is so great you can't compare.Sarpatta parambarai is one of the great movie which preaches 'Never give up'. I love how the story has came up, except some political issue though it's important for the character to shape it's best.Cast is just superb. None of them are neglected, they have their own role to fill up the movie to fullest.I love ROSE's character, he just done his role amazingly.This is just a best movie that you should not miss.",Sarpatta Parambarai

75,sleodeepak,Sarpatta Parambarai is a rousing boxing marvelous drama. Predictable but worth watch movie. Master class from Arya and Ranjith,10,22 July 2021,"I will start with the negative first, What I have felt negative is caste related dialogues. Ranjith should try to reduce the caste related dialogues. Its not the first movie, each and every movie he is doing the same. Except that movie is fantastic and Must watch movie. Below my opinion about this fantastic movie.One more rocking performance from Arya after Mahamuni. Arya is brilliant as Kabilan and this is definitely one of his top-class performances. Arya is an absolute delight to watch when he is inside the boxing ring. His physical fitness has definitely added more authenticity to the film. However, he looks a little lesser intense in some emotionally charged sequences. Pasupathy is an actor par excellence and he manages to fit into any given character. Pasupathy, as a mentor figure is highly impressive and it is a treat to watch him perform. John Kokken, as Vembuli, strikes well with the action moves. He doesn't have major scope to emote, but with actions, he scores full marks.Dushara Vijayan, as Mariyamma, the female lead, is promising and it looks like Ranjith has spotted another talented actor. Dushara (as Mariyamma) emotes really well when she tries to strike a chord with her husband. Kalaiyarasan leaves a good impact with the limited scope that he gets. John Vijay did his best as anglo Indian. None of the movie, director use him properly. Its one of the best movie for him after Mouna Guru. GM Sundar, Anupama Kumar, Santhosh Prathap, and others play their part well. One of my fav role in this movie is Shabeer Kallarakkal as DANCING ROSE - what an extraordinary character and what a transformation by the actor to play the role. The casting equation is fantastic and due credits to Ranjith and team for picking the right set of actors. After you finish watching the film, it feels like all the actors have lived in their respective roles.Santhosh Narayanan's musical score is one of the biggest strengths of Sarpatta Parambarai. His powerful scores during the boxing matches elevate the energy to a different level. 'Neeye Oli' is great.Sarpatta Parambarai definitely deserves a watch and it will definitely make your time worth it. Watch it for the awe-inspiring dedication of Arya and the effective execution of Pa Ranjith.",Sarpatta Parambarai

Arya standing with his gloves and the red color of the poster shown how amazing thay could be. After just finishing the movie with all my excitements and nerve wrenching moments, loved the acting and directtion of the film and that includes everyone.

82,desikanks,An Enjoyable historical drama,7,28 July 2021,"A clean and enjoyable film without any specific agenda from Pa Ranjith. Well researched and presented. All lead characters have done very well. Pashupathi is a very talented actor and essays his role effortlessly. John Vijay, a generally an under rated actor, does a brilliant role. His English (as an Anglo Indian) slang and body language are thoroughly enjoyable. ""Dancing Rose"" needs special mention. A different role for Arya and an important one in his career. He can be happy and proud. Dushara Vijayan as Arya's wife does a satisfying part. As a person who grew up in North Madras during the Seventies, I could understand and relate to the historical background of Boxing Emergency situation and Politics. Lastly Santhosh Narayan has done a good job as a music director. Overall, an enjoyable historical drama.",Sarpatta Parambarai

Credit to the editing, cinematography, production design, costume design, art direction and every other technical aspect of the movie.The director/script writer has made sure that his ideologies about caste makes its way through as it does in his earlier works. However, it does not feel out of place or irrelevant.Arya finally gives a massive hit (probably) both commercially and critically as well. Sad that this could not be released in the big screen.Pasupathi as the coach, John Vijay as Daddy, shabeer as Dancing rose deserve special mention.Verdict - must watch boxing period drama.",Sarpatta Parambarai

Like it will be even more impressive than you thought this would be.Haven't seen any other sports film in India that's so much raw, detailed, well edited like Sarpatta parambarai. This is like an FPS game where yours is a POV of Chennai in the 1970s.Just to give you how much engaging this film is, the opening scene in this film is 22 minutes. Like just one scene and it's bloody 22 minutes but it was also bloody engrossing. The film runs for 173 minutes and not once do you feel bored.I have to say this but Sarpatta has to be easily the best Indian sports film ever produced just cause this is the actual representation on how life and sports works in India! No hiding from the truth. Not even shying away from political interests among the sportsmen when the 1970s emergency happened. This is way too realistic that sensitive people can easily get offended. Almost gives the same experience Scorsese gave you in Raging bull!The performances gives you a standard to measure someone's performamce next time you watch a good film. Arya is just outstanding! So are Pasupathy,John Vijay, Kalaiyarasan and the ensemble cast out of whom, everyone performed excellently!Pa Ranjith has given a masterpiece to not miss in your life.

What's defo unique and gripping is the storytelling; raw, narrating the ups & lows of Kabilan, and the continuous hatred and rivalry that makes the plot all the more entertaining. The boxing scenes looks unrealistic, although enough to excite a buff. All in all makes for an excellent weekend binge, though at almost 3 hours the movie is lengthyP.

The way ranjith told the story was awesome. And take a bow to the acting of all the cast members and especially the man ARYA and PASUPATHI took their acting to the next level.

98,ramesh-80651,Nothing to be overhyped,4,27 July 2021,"I have no clue why everyone praising this movie
I don't see any good reason to celebrate also
Yes I do agree about the art work and making style, well made
And as I see in the story. Hero never practice anything about the boxing and nothing has in detail
He simply agree to fight with some one in certain situation immediately he hit the opponent
I have no idea how can you be a professionlist in boxing by seeing it. It's like we all watch cricket suddenly you are committing to play with international cricketer and yet you failed him, no practice and you won in your debut game.Then in the middle he fought well with the opponent very easily
And in the final game after having all practice and hardwork he won at the end and I didn't see any good fight may be my prime login didn't showed I guess
There is some laggy part in the middle of the flim. As a sports man he has no decipline going with friends drinking and doing illegal activities
He cant think himself that he is doing wrong
Suddenly he get the changeover want to win the final match. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
If it's a commercial movie we don't want to see such logic
But if you portrayed as a well made sports flim you should think about these logic too
My point of view. It's a good movie technically and they put lot of hardwork too
but the story and some logics I can't digest.",Sarpatta Parambarai
99,M_S_V,Unexplored history of boxing in Tamil Nadu,6,22 July 2021,"By the end of 20 mins or the first match you know what the story is and how is it going to end ( had you not watched the trailer it would take that long else you know the story even before watching the movie). It's all about how you take off from there and make the audience engaged till the last. First of all it takes a lots of talent for someone to make a film after all of this. The movie had one of the best music, cast, set design. Of all the lead actors arya deserves a special mention for his complete transformation both in terms of acting and body. For me personally this movie is the least favourite of all ranjith's film. The movie had a great start but somewhere in the mid when the hero gets away from boxing I started losing my interest. Though the movie had a great climax I still could not enjoy the film as I was enjoying it during the first 1:30 hrs but this film is a definite watch for someone to know how authentic you can be in making a 70's period film.",Sarpatta Parambarai

106,ajju-cool,Watchable but too lengthy,6,22 July 2021,"2 Indian movies (Toofan and Sarpatta Parambarai) based on boxing, released in a span of a week and both share a number of similarities.Both the movies are nearly 3 hrs long (unnecessarily). The essence or the plot of both movies is more or less the same. The rise, the fall and the redemption of the protagonist. Between the fall and redemption, the protagonists in both the movies gets awfully out of shape and gets body shamed on the way to glory.Sticking to Sarpatta Parambarai, the movie would connect well emotionally with the audience as it portrays and captures most of the emotional and cultural aspects well.However, technically, considering this is a sports based movie, it's weak.The boxing skills of Arya showcased in the movie is average at best. The skills of his opponents is well below average. The physique of most of the opponents, including that of the main opponent, is weak and is not in line with a proper athlete.The boxing coaching is awful and has nothing to add to the protagonists skills during training or during matches.Acting wise, Arya holds the screen well. Dushara portrays her part perfectly. All the supporting cast plays their parts well.The first 90 minutes of the movie is breezes through and enjoyable to watch but then the next 90 sorts of drags it.If you have the time and don't mind nitpicking faults in the sporting sequence, watch it.If you want to watch movie purely for it's drama, watch it.You want miss much if you decide to skip it.",Sarpatta Parambarai

115,EyeWritings,A REMARKABLE MASTERPIECE FROM PA.RANJITH & ARYA. FINEST WORK OF EVERY CRAFT.,10,22 July 2021,"Pa. Ranjith has separate fan base among the audience. Some people call him as a revolutionary filmmaker and some call him as a contemporary filmmaker but his ideology in making films with a intense must told social issues made him as one of the unique directors of Indian cinema. Right from the beginning of his career he tries to implicitly tell audience about few social issues in a very understanding and convincing way.Even as a producer, he delivered a cult classic film Pariyerum Perumal which is one of the great films in Indian cinema from the last decade.No matter what kind of film he is making, he definitely keep social elements such as OPPRESSIONS, DISCRIMINATIONS, INEQUALITIES, BETRAYAL, POWER GAMES, LOVE, EDUCATION & REVOLUTION which he has shown usually in his previous films. Same tried again for SARPATTA and worked out well.After announcing that this film is a sports drama (Boxing) most of us think that Pa. Ranjith coming out of his style and trying for exploring another element.But after the release of Characters Intro as a first teaser of this film, We starts expecting another path breaking film from him.Now finally this film is beyond our expectations and reached our expectations with high impact.Yes, After a gap Pa. Ranjith created magic with his own style in filmmaking. He delivered a masterpiece which we are all expecting from the last few years.We have seen many sports drama flicks previously. It's a kind of fire game to directors like Pa. Ranjith to make a film with this centric plot. Because if it get bored in any part, the entire result will be a bitter experience.Intense Emotions & Screenplay are the two must needed elements for this genre based films. If any of these two things went bad, it will definitely spoil the soul of the film even though it worked out well in other aspects such as performances.But the Mastermind Pa. Ranjith here changed the game and exceptionally executed it by selecting flawless cast and crew and making it with his own style of essence.If would like to write about every character it will be a big article for sure. As we already knows that Ranjith is too good in designing of arc for even a less screen space character. Same thing proved again.Pasupathy as Coach Rangan, John Vijay as Daddy, Dushara Vijayan as Mariamma, Vembuli, Vetri every character will be surely remembered for long time.Apart from Arya as Kabilan, Rangan, Daddy, Dancing Rose, Mariamma the true show stealers.A Sculptor needs a stone to make a good sculpture. But here Pa. Ranjith got a great gem like Arya, then what else, he made an Artful, soulful crown which shines for long time.It's a biggggggg punch to those who said that Arya's film career is over in Tamil Cinema, He is a stereotype in Indian Cinema, He lost his soul as an actor......so and so....
He proved again that he is a game changer.It's a strong comeback which is never ever expected. He deserves it... Kudos to his dedication, transformation. If not Arya no one can do justice to such intense role. It's a kind of tailor-made film for him. One and only Arya...Final Verdict :
Then Soorarai Pottru Now Sarpatta, films which surely deserves theatrical release to create more impactful sensation.After experiencing such finest work of every craft and brilliant output, we must say without any hesitations that this film is undoubtedly an Exceptional, Memorable and a Landmark one. Don't miss it.",Sarpatta Parambarai

The brave overtones in the screenplay -be it the political biases, caste/ social biases,the protagonist's weaknesses are laid out to the audience bare-naked. Never does it feel , that the story has been overboard with tomfoolery action. The sequencing in which Vembuli is portrayed in the final fight is a first to Indian cinema. Rangan's attitude towards indiscipline is also smartly shown. For the central character, Kabilan's struggles are nicely directed by Ranjith and performed by Arya. The script is so tight that any disciplined actor could have done justice to this role. Also production takes kudos in not going overboard with set designs. Furthermore, the epic saga also focuses on the struggles that other characters have -Rose outlook on his loss, Rangan and his son's struggles to establish their rightful place in Sarapatta clan,mariammas no nonsense typical attitude.

127,lalithkishore-87598,Masterclass,10,26 July 2021,This movie correctly reminds us the old madras. The roles habe fit bery good. That's one of the best films in arya s career.,Sarpatta Parambarai
128,kaya_natarajan,Rocky chased Chickens.. Kabilan chases Crabs,7,26 July 2021,"Sarpatta Parambarai is a period sports drama by Pa Ranjith showcasing the rise-fall-rise of a boxer and two feuding boxing schools in 70s Madras. Kabilan (Arya), a dock worker, is a loyal fan of the Sarpatta boxing school led by Rangan Vathiar (Pasupathy). Bakkiyam (Anupama Kumar), Kabilan's mother, believes boxing will eventually lead to one becoming a rogue and get killed like her husband. Kabilan's passion to don the gloves is hindered by this belief but he manages to follow and watch the local bouts with Daddy (John Vijay). A chance encounter has Kabilan exhibit his pugilistic skills and win the respect of Rangan Vathiar and earn the wrath of others. The rest of the story revolves around his trials set to the political backdrop of the period.Featuring an ensemble cast, each character is crafted with depth and is done justice by the artistes. Pasupathy as Rangan Vathiar and John Vijay as Daddy excel in their roles. The entire cast actually deserves merit for the convincing portrayal of their roles. However, Shabeer Kallarakkal as Dancing Rose punches way above his weight (and steals the show).Sarpatta Parambarai is an audio-visual treat and the crew deserve an extra round of applause for the effort in recreating the period. The boxing choreography is top-notch and physical transformation from the leads is dedication to the craft. Kabilan running after crabs reminds one of Rocky chasing down chickens in the coop.With a running time of 2 hours and 54 minutes, the movie tends to drag at places but manages to keep you glued to the seat. One of the scenes that felt predictable and dull was Kabilan's emotional breakdown to Bakkiyam and her charged response egging him on to rise up again. In contrast, a very subtle scene, when Rangan Vathiar, comes back home after a long time in jail, is being served food by his wife (Geetha Kailasam). As he eats, she sits beside him and gently presses/ holds his feet. They both look at each other exchanging a myriad of emotions.However, with many (outside Chennai and the younger generation) being unaware of this boxing heritage could find being pushed in to the deep end. The director could've focussed on a small account of the clans before jumping in to the ring. Though some shots feel off the target, Pa Ranjith could've very well got the youth out of their lockdown blues and pick up their mitts.",Sarpatta Parambarai
129,praneethvsp,A different approach on sports movie,10,31 July 2021,The screenplay is at its best. Even though the runtime is close to 3hrs it doesn't fail to keep you engaged credit goes to the director. Many strong characters make you want spin-off( especially dancing rose ),Sarpatta Parambarai
130,lazykoala-90980,Pa. Ranjith is back with a bang.,8,4 October 2021,"After two disappointing ventures, this feels more like Ranjith going back to his roots - a film set in Madras, with characters from underprivileged communities facing life in their own ways, the consequences of their actions, and how they overcome it.Suffice to say, this movie is one of the best I have watched this year. Arya is absolutely incredible in his role, Pasupathy puts out a rock solid performance, the boxing scenes were accurate enough to be enjoyable, and Pa.

133,clreddy21,Decent sports drama lagged with unwanted politics and caste issues,7,24 July 2021,The setting and the proper casting of characters has helped the movie a lot. My only concern is the lag of caste & politics in second half which i is unwontedly pushed into the movie by director spoiling the core genre of the movie.This has been a consistent issue with PA Ranjit with all his movies.Just adds a random caste/race/ethnic issues which should have been a proper commercial movie.

Pa. Ranjith, with his regular crew, did an extraordinary job. Hard work never killed anyone! Pa. Ranjith, no doubt, is in full form.Crew:Director: Pa. RanjithStarring: Arya, Dushara Vijayan, Pasupathy, Kalaiarasan, Santosh Pratap, Anupama Kumar, Sanchana Natarajan
Music: Santhosh NarayananPlot:
Sarpatta Parambarai is about the clash between two boxing groups, Sarpatta ( sharp of four knives ) & Idiyappa Parambarai, in North Chennai, and its politics. Pa.Ranjith touched the emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, which was objected only to by Kalainar Karunanidhi. Even there was a dialogue in the movie saying CM's son got arrested during this Emergency period. One cannot avoid the thoughts of Mr. M. K. Stalin, CM.Arya's acting is remarkable. One fact is made crystal clear that the directors failed to use Aaya properly in their movies, and Arya is not responsible for not being in the limelight. At the same time, Arya also should work hard to grab the opportunities. Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, Arya! You should do it to gain.All the supporting characters rendered brilliant performances. Especially John, Dancing Jose, no way. I was only Dance Jose's legs when he was boxing inside the ring. Pashupathy's act as a coach is flawless. On the whole, Awe-inspiring performance by each and every one.It would have been great had this movie been released in the theatre. But still, the audience has the advantage of seeing this movie on OTT because they could rewind the scenes as many times as they want, particularly the romantic scenes of Arya with his wife. It was so natural and full of romance.I recommend seeing this movie and enjoy the depth in it.",Sarpatta Parambarai
147,Wagingwars,Fantastic but could have been better.,8,1 October 2021,"The flim has usual underdog trope that we usually see in sports movie but the riveting character arcs and the social-political backdrop overwhelms the cliched plot template and keeps you engaged till the end credits. Although Ranjith treats boxing with realism there were few shots that seemed over-dramatized and artificial. Overall, it is worth 3 hours of your leisure time.",Sarpatta Parambarai

149,shaik215,"Forget Toofaan, Watch this piece of gem",9,23 July 2021,"I had zero expectations with the second boxing film SARPATTA PARAMBARAI premiering on prime video after Toofaan which was an average predictable film as people say, and I gotta say I'm really impressed. Runtime of 2h53mins really scared me, but I took my time and really endulged into this film. Not a single segment of the runtime bored me and I watched this in one go. The editing is off the charts, I can't fathom how much of footage had to be cut short to fit in the long runtime. Especially the 'fall of Kabilan' segment which was like 15 mins but they showed a storyline which would have been a while other film. Arya gives his career best performance and I was really impressed also Pa Ranjith the director, although I haven't seen enough of their films. Taking inspiration from major boxing films I love how the ethnic and cultural phenomena is the basis of the film which amplifies the north chennai Tamil 1970s era. I gotta watch Madras now. That's been on my list for too long.PS Dancing Rose really stole the showI can't help but think what an experience a theatrical release would have been. Definitely a must watch💯",Sarpatta Parambarai
150,narain-39220,A must watch,9,27 July 2021,"An excellent sports drama by Ranjith. He is back with a great movie after madras. Every scene represents the hard work of the director and the team. It brings back the 70s right in front of you and the cast gives life to that setting. ""Dancing Rose"" steals the show with great performances that make people want more. Rangan master and Daddy Kevin are excellent roles played by excellent actors. The women in the movie play their part and Mariamma also does so well. The screen play is a bit sloppy in the second half where the lead goes awry and makes a comeback. However it doesn't take much away from the movie. Overall a must watch!",Sarpatta Parambarai

I'm a great fan of Arya.. but all his hardwork is wasted in a confused weak character. The second of is the worst.. the movie runs almost in a fast forward.. the boxing scenes are pathetic.. one exception is the dancing boxer. Having said that there are several actors played their roles on perfection with amazing body language and dialogue delivery. The art and music was too good for this movie. The screen play was too messed up.. too many things going on in every scene and all the scenes are too short to get anything out of it. Though Pasupathy acted really well.. the dialogues and the characterization did not have any credibility for a Asan/teacher of boxing. During the matches he just yells like any other spectators.. as a teacher he should be giving some technical pointers for the players.I understand this review will be rediculed by many fanboys.. but I don't give a #$@&",Sarpatta Parambarai

164,thesrilankanlad,Best Tamil Sports film I have seen to date!,8,26 July 2021,"Plot: The basic storyline for this film is what you would expect from a typical Tamil movie where there is the hero and a villain and the hero wins at the end. However, what is different about this film is that there is no ""villain"" as such and each character can be categorised in different ways. There are parts where the hero becomes a villain and where the villain is actually a good guy in a way.Runtime: This film is about 2hrs 50mins long which being a regular Tamil film watcher is slightly longer that some usual films but what is satisfying about this is that every minute is engaging and you pretty much are mentally on the edge of your seat. It's not as predictable as the storyline suggests yet there are loads of little plot twists along the way which causes us to think in a different light. And for a runtime of nearly 3hrs, this film is structurally well balanced in direction and speed. There is not a single scene that feels rushed or stretched which is a major positive in any Tamil film of any genre.Cast: When you are directing a sports film , you have to be theoretically correct with your characters and as this is a boxing film so you would typically expect well-built actors for those roles. You could tell that a lot of training had gone in to make the already shredded actors more built for the sport and this was partly shown before the film release in the behind the scenes videos.Arya played a very convincing and brilliant role of Kablian. The way he portrayed Kabilan in a measured way , showed the amount of commitment he had for this script. The looks of all the actors especially the boxers were brilliant and depicted what it was like in the 70s . The way they acted when arguing or fighting shows that a lot of research had gone into this and the boxing performances was also not over the top and was so realistic , it felt like I was actually watching a boxing match. Hats off also to Pasupathi , who played Rangan. I personally loved this character because his posture and the way looked at people , almost staring down their souls when others locked horns with this character and the sheer amount of patience when things were going wrong was really commendable . Credits also to the other actors , actresses not to name a few.Music: When there are so many positives in this film , you would wonder where there are small holes. I gave a lot of thought and decided that the BGM, although it gave an energy and was very punchy, felt slightly repetitive. But this alone fortunately didn't;t let the film down because you were so engrossed in the film itself , the BGM became second priority. But wow, did Santhosh Narayanan really showcase the spirits of sports and boxing. This film really proved to many I hope that this really was his year . Producing songs like Enjoy Enjaami to then listening to glimpse of that every-motivating Neeye Oli was something else.Cinematography: Probably the best element of this film. The setting had to be almost perfect to the dot because when you are focusing on a specific time period especially in the 20th century , the research has to be important as the application . All in all , to keep this review short, the cinematography was really convincing of the 70s.Improvements: Firstly , I felt that there could be more variety in the BGM , for example, a proper badass fight theme to spur on the matches, perhaps a slight kuthu BGM in a traditional way. Finally, there could have been a few light hearted scenes to give viewers time to absorb what had happened because although I was engaged , I felt too engaged in a way and I felt that a few off the plot romantic scenes between Arya and the heroine could have balanced the film a bit more .ON THE WHOLE , A REALLY WELL MADE FILM . HATS OFF TO THE CAST AND TEAM OF SARPATTA PARAMBARAI AND I WISH DIRECTOR PA. RANJITH MORE SUCCESS UPON THIS . BEST SPORTS FILM IN TAMIL AND LETS SEE IF ANYHTING CAN TOP THIS ONE.",Sarpatta Parambarai

I felt narration of sensitive issues related to TN was not at all required. It also loses sense when unnecessary pointers are given, like the dress before the final bout.This is my personal opinion though, if these things werent there, probably within 120-140 minutes the movie would have be cult classic with respect to boxing. I think the director has vision beyond these things which is sad it has been brought to the movie.I undestand little Tamil, but was still able to follow due to subtitles but this is my personal opinion.

193,kumarpasupathy,Good Attempt. But not as great as the other reviews say,6,1 August 2021,"Positives:
Since it is a sports/action movie, Arya has worked well on his fitness. The boxing moves/punches/footwork looked real.A good attempt at highlighting the local boxing culture in North Madras. A good attempt at recreating the 1970s vibe.The movie shows how a boxer turns into a gangster in a very very realistic way. This part was explained beautifully by Ranjith.Negatives:
I felt many parts of the movie were copied from the Bollywood movie - ""Sultan"" starring Salman Khan (And I am guessing, Sultan itself was copied from the Hollywood movie - Rocky Balboa). The story line too similar to miss (A talented wrestler/boxer stops playing his sport for some reason. And after a hiatus, he trains hard again, gets back his old form and wins a tournament against all odds).One might say this movie was ""inspired"" by some other movie. I would say - ""copied"".Needless to say, story was predictable.The movie runs for 3 hours and it is a tiring watch. There isn't enough content to fill in 3 hours. The scenes where members from one clan meeting the other to schedule a boxing bout keeps repeating needlessly. The boxing match scenes were good, but were too long. An average cinema watcher who doesn't have any special interest in boxing (like me) will find this boring after a point.Ranjith's typical anti-Hindu overtones and propaganda were in plenty. You have characters who are unabashedly a devout Christian or Muslim. But the characters with Hindu names are all followers of Periyar, Karunanidhi, Ambedkar etc. Even during weddings, Hindu gods are never shown. By the way, the weddings are like ""Self-Respect"" weddings (no Vedic chants, no priest etc).Santosh Narayan's music was not good I must say. Too loud and jarring.Summary: A decent attempt at highlighting the local boxing culture in North Madras with a predictable/formulaic story line and usual P. Ranjith's propaganda elements. Worth watching once. But I disagree with the reviews which say that this is a cult. Far from a cult movie, I would say.",Sarpatta Parambarai

Often these kind of movies are made only to glorify the male protagonist so it would be commercially viable to the audience.This industry has forgotten the art of movie making not that it had it in the first place. But once a while we see movies that shows the better side of movies, the creative side, the beautiful side of it.Pa ranjith has made one of those kind of movies.",Sarpatta Parambarai
196,vadivan,Talk of the town,9,26 July 2021,"Sarpatta Parambarai - My review
After the immensely disappointing experience with Jagame Thandhiram I did not have high hopes for Sarpatta Parambarai. I assumed Pa. Ra would have undergone the post-Rajni movie disorientation that Ka. Su went through. Pa. Ra proves otherwise, and I did not regret a minute of watching SarPar.While I was growing up in a small town, there used to be kabaddi tournaments (much before street cricket took over). A rough game that kept many like me away from playing, but we used to enjoy the watching experience. SarPar brings alive that nostalgia. There is this unabashed nativity about this movie with no pretention, that makes you sit up and say 'That's what I wanna watch Bugga'.Here the sport is boxing, which is not played in most of South India. Yet Pa. Ra has creates a convincing experience, which makes you sit for close to 3 hours, with occasional difficulties.The storyline is nothing creative. But the premise and the characters are. The movie opens up and goes on till it sets the stage for what is coming, and only then the title slide comes up. By then, you are either bought in to the plot or you are logging out. There is no in-between.The screen-time of the key characters as compared to the protagonist says it all. It is not a movie about one man. It is about the sport, pride, the clan and the place. Daddy (John Vijay) and Dancing Rose (Shabeer) deserve a loud applause. A memorable role for Pasupathi after a long while.Arya shines with his sincere effort. Arguably his best so far, though his voice fails him yet again. Every other character is worth mentioning. The boxers' references and the research behind their styles are impressive. Very few Tamil directors succeed in that.This movie is not without its flaws. It has many. Make no mistakes, this is an out and out mass entertainer.Looks like it is an unwritten rule (since Rocky or even before) that sports movies should show the routine done-to-death workout sessions where the protagonist turns around from a paunch wielding (fake one though) uncle to 7 packs (or whatever, I lost count) athlete.And that 'slo-mo' for the climax fight was totally unnecessary. The fights in the first half were raw and real.Why should Pa. Ra's strong women be screaming all the while? Every time Arya's (Anupama Kumar) mom comes on screen I could feel my ears bleeding. This woman's shrill voice is deadlier than Vembuli's (John Kokken) punches.The decibel levels of all the characters are unnecessarily high. Everyone is screaming all the time. Anupama still stands out.These flaws, in no way come in the way of the pace of the movie. SarPar is likely to be an everyday topic for many days to come. A must watch.",Sarpatta Parambarai

Does the strong justifies 3 hours moves, absolutely NOT. Boxing has been used to show the originality of the movie, but honestly speaking it is just a spin off of movies with similar storyline.

Director ranjith is one of the bold director, where he indicates everything real including political parties name and their evolution in tamilnadu. This movie moves with the emergency, promoted by indira gandhi. 1st half was engaging and art direction and cinemotography was too good. Though , the 2nd half seems lag due to political influence , the movie was overall an treat if released in theatres. Sandhosh music is good but in theatre it will be tremendous. This sports drama plays justice to every boxing drama movies in world.We have to speak about arya, he was so good for the role and the transformation he shows all over the movie is fabulous.

219,natureboy-84907,OTT Champions,8,25 July 2021,"SarPetta Parambarai, for a change Ranjith didn't bring in any controversial subject involving a caste or community that's in existence to my knowledge. I would say this is one of best creations of PA Ranjith . The new dad Arya has done a great job , put in lot of work to look so muscled and responsibly well acted doing justification to the character . His attempts of crying and punching on screen were quite natural . Then comes the line up of real performers , Shabeer as Dancing Rose, what a performance with those gracious dancing moves during the boxing fights. John Vijay he needs a mention here for the kind of supporting role he played flavoured with those enjoyable English dialogues . Dushara as the female lead does a natural performance with a pleasant face . John Kokken as Vembulli fits well as opponent to Kabilan (Arya) in the ring. The character Raman played by Santhosh was equally good in par with other supporting roles . Ranjith ensures Kalaiyarasan to be part of this film playing a prominent role with opportunity to display his acting skills . Anupama as Kabilan's mom does a very neat job and ensures nothing more or nothing less to the need . Pasupathi needs a mention here too for being consistent in all his role and for adapting the requisite for the character . Even after so many years he doesn't show up getting old . The entire team has put in lots of efforts in not just building an interesting storyline but also to ensure every reel is filled with muscled looks of the characters appearing . Worth all the strenuous workouts done by the team . Cinematography was good , special mention goes to the art directors for recreating the old madras. BGM by Santosh Narayan fits well to the scenes and enriches the intensity . Stunt sequence were well timed and every punch was power packed . With all these aside , there was a need for trimming some portion in the second half to carry forward the intensity from the first half until end . Also felt the end was little simple and abrupt considering the buildup given in the previous scenes . Climax could have been maximised but felt very minimised . Except for this , the movie is thoroughly enjoyable and comes under a one time must watch category . Overall Sarpatta Paramparai , May not be Champions of Olympics but of OTT this 2021.",Sarpatta Parambarai

248,mdgautamk,Absolutely worth your time!,9,22 July 2021,"I know there are a bunch of Tamil boxing movies out there, and I haven't watched any of them, because I have never fully trusted our people to properly execute a sports movie. And this time, my lack of trust was not wrong. Because Sarpatta Parambarai is not a sports movie.It would make a lot of sense if it was classified as one, but this is beyond your average entertaining sports movie. It is the culmination of family drama, politics, period setting, redemption arcs, broken relationships and finally, sports. It would be injustice to compare this movie to a Hollywood boxing movie like Rocky or Raging Bull, because it is a movie special to the boxing culture in our city. It is a wonderful representation of the passionate love for boxing that we can see everywhere in Chennai.I did not expect Pa. Ranjith to make a movie about boxing, but after watching the trailer when it first came out, it became clear that boxing was not the only plot element that took center stage. The movie is about Kabilan, an aspiring boxer whose mother wants him to steer clear of the sport due to a family tragedy involving his father's boxing ventures. But nothing can dampen the fiery enthusiasm in his eyes everytime he watches a boxing match. The way he plays out the potential boxing moves as a spectator, the way he can recite every boxing match he witnessed and the outcomes of each and every round by memory, the way he defends his former boxing coach whenever someone disrespects him, are all testament to the fact that the protagonist is an unstoppable force, and Arya captures this aspect of the character properly. Santhosh Narayanan's adrenaline-filled score combined with the expert editing and visuals further elevates it. However, I feel that certain scenes that required intense emotional response from him were not up to the mark set by his costars Pasupathy and Kalaiyarasan.Speaking of Kalaiyarasan, his performance was strongly felt in this movie. I'm glad that Ranjith did not use him as some character that has zero effect on the plot. He is a legitimate side character. Personally, the ""he picked a stranger over his own child"" trope is a bit tiring, but the angst that he shows is very legitimate and comes from a genuine place of disappointment and fury. This is all thanks to the excellent writing by Ranjith and Thamizh Prabha. Every dialogue and scene feels natural and not forced at all. This is especially surprising for a Tamil movie where the audience is usually spoonfed with exposition. That is not to say that exposition is avoided here, but it is rather used cleverly. There is a dream sequence halfway through, and it perfectly shows the passage of time and what has happened. I cannot fully describe because it would spoil the movie.Another thing that I found interesting is the handling of the political environment of the 1970s and its depiction. Some might hate the movie for the political stances of the characters, but said stances are mostly irrelevant in the context of the plot. Nevertheless, the subtle references to Karunanidhi, MGR, MR Radha, the Emergency and the opposition party politics between DMK and ADMK are well-done and easy to catch. And as usual, you have the mentions of Ambedkar, Peritar, and representation of a minority community, though it is never specified which community and why it is a minority, which brings me to the biggest problem I have with this film.There is a constant mention of Kabilan having to beat the reigning champion Vembuli and how the opportunity to do so is very important for his neighbourhood, but the movie never explains or explores the place the people in that neighbourhood have in the Vadachennai society. It feels like an important part of the story was missing, and it would have given Kabilan's urge to defeat Vembuli a more communal angle that was much-needed for a story that is taking place during a controversial period in Indian history.But looking past all that, I have to appreciate the fact that Ranjith was able to contain a long and emotionally arduous journey in perfectly paced and used three hours is impressive. With that said, this movie is totally worth your time, and a new addition to Pa. Ranjith's near-perfect filmography, with this one being the cherry on top.9/10.",Sarpatta Parambarai

258,varietyisspiceoflife,My rating for this Epic Movie is 9.5/10,9,5 August 2021,"I didn't know how to give it 9.5 but this website captured it as 9. Great Movie. What a Screenplay, What a Casting, Great Direction, What an Emotion. My Goodness, this Movie was full of Goosebumps in most of the shots. If there's Any other Periodic Movie after ""Madrasapattinam"" in which all the casts have got equal importance to their roles in Screenplay, then it is ""Sarpatta Parambarai"". Every characters carrying its own essence. Boxers getting hit Real hard not for Cinematic Camera effects but for Real, those punches, those hits and those bleeding are for real and can be felt while you watch the Movie. The Art Director must definitely be appreciated for struggling so hard to keep those 70's Periodic set so safe, because the Film shoot stopped during the Pandemic Lockdown and Curfew. Doesn't looks like a Set at all, everything seems to be so real. A Definite Watch Movie for everyone especially Every Indian. Not just once or twice but can be watched repeatedly until and unless you feel satisfied of it. Toofan is definitely just a wind that passes by with 3.5/10 but this Movie is definitely a Boxing Sports based Movie. Sarpatta Parambarai has definitely eaten up and swallowed Toofan in all aspects.",Sarpatta Parambarai

The movie takes viewers back to 1970. All the artists who acted in movie were fantastic. I think there are 10 or 12 main characters in movie, every role is important to movie. Movie could have rocked box office if released in Theaters. Also why the movie is released in Telugu and Tamil languages only. It could be dubbed in all other languages as well.

The way of narrating a story which is revolving several characters and carrying a full length mass movie also it might be an usual indian sports template cinematic movie - But, it is really difficult to make a movie without confusing with lot of impressive charectors ( what a characters design!) - A lot of research, workshops and well written screen play might be behind it.Screen play of this movie ""sarpatta parambarai"" can be recommended as reference or model for tamil debut directors.Hats off to all the technician's who involved for this wounderful movie creation - Sarpatta Paramparai.We expect more and different journers of movies from director Pa Ranjith and his team in the near future.Best wishes from

361,ananthnarayan-35439,SARPATTA PARAMBARAI REVIEW BY VANGA BLOGALAM,8,25 July 2021,"A well crafted period sports drama by Pa. Ranjith after two films with Superstar not produced mixed responses . All characters will be remembered by character names rathar than original names . Arya has given stupendous performance after Nan kadavul . He has totally adopted nad given more tha. 💯 . Pasupathy , John vijay proves their mettle . Anupama as Arya mother has given memorable performance . We can't forget vembuli and dancing rose for long time . Production design and Music is top notch . Flipside is unnecessary casteism remarks and dragging a bit after second half . Over all good movie to watch with family . Movie will take us to 1970 s of North Madras for sure . SARAPATTA PARAMBARAI _ SUCCESS PARAMBARAI .",Sarpatta Parambarai

Every actor did their character well..no words...yet another master piece from Mr. Pa. Ranjith. But the director could not reisist himself from mixing dalit politics and caste wherever possible. A party that doesnt have any dalit representation is shown as close to dalits. A particular religious symbols being used where ever a character has to be vilified.,Sarpatta Parambarai
366,vishnusyamvs,Arya with his innocence as insanity,9,25 July 2021,"If it is anyone other than Arya it would have ended up as a big flop when it goes International. I feel this film has high potential to be a landmark movie and an evergreen movie for movie enthusiasts and anyone who has a fire to keep up their pride and care for their loved ones. Innocence is insanity for some of those who ended up in the boxing ring as amateurs or professionals. It's a well-researched movie where every actor has devoted their best efforts to ensure that they will live in the memory of their audience regardless of whatever minute roles they have done. The Tamil film industry created something worthy enough for a blood rush. It has the essence of sportsmanship, love, fight, dance, music, pride, and plenty of emotions that I am not sure that I will discover on my next watch.",Sarpatta Parambarai

Dancing rose, Kabilan's wife and coach immediately come to mind. Would say that importance given to other characters makes this film different from the other hero oriented movies.",Sarpatta Parambarai

447,sameerpanchangam,"Lousy script, money spinner for make up and prop artists",6,1 August 2021,"Poor casting for coach. Not even a single inspirational, hair raising dialogue by the coach. Most of the writing is filled with cheap trolling, haters. While Arya's look get the movie watchers to ogle at him, the others just about drag the movie with a very expected route.",Sarpatta Parambarai

4 hours agoSarpatta Parambarai is a movie not just for entertainment but for craving more than boxing melodrama. It tells you the heroic drama with sense of realism in it. It tells story of minion ,his phenomenal rise ,fall and rise from pheniox.Story is of lower class man who is great fan of boxing and has history of boxing (his father boxer who got butchered in front of him). Boxing culture in rural Madras in early 70's which divided into different clan and fight for pride. Sarpatta name is of clan(Just this name fascinated me to watch this movie) who is loosing it's shine and coach is looking for good fighter for his clan. Then he found fighter but he betrays him ,and sequence of events lead to informal fight between Kabilan(our protagonist) and this lead him to fight for clan. But during epic battle between then champion Vembuli who belongs to different clan,emergency provisions start and fight ends abruptly with lot of unholy events ,even our protagonist ripped of with his decency.As his master Rangan who trained Kabilan belongs to DMK sent to jail and his son of coach Vetriselvan with help of Kabilan get envolved in uncanny things and left boxing ,even remain drunk. Here potrayal of small caste people and how their life goes haywire without guidence.Then again sequence of events happens even he goes to jail and then he become sober and his path of recovery to claim which was left to complete.Arya as Kabilan is phenomenal and always keep things real and grounded. Next is his Coach Rangan acted by Pasupathy is master piece. All other actors did their part with finesse.Now it comes to speak about direction and Pa. Ranjith did masterpice and is on legendry path. I would love him to see directing some bollywood movie. Fight sequence,style, cinematography all makes fighting scenes real and cameo to watch.Watch it for boxing and much more,underlying currents presented in between. Memorable treat for weekend ....remember it is Sarpatta.",Sarpatta Parambarai
450,vishumentos,Words wouldn't be enough...,10,29 July 2021,"An absolute entertainer. The best tamil movie by far this year. Dancing Rose's dance was a treat. Best part was Kabilan defeating Dancing Rose. Pa Ranjith, take a bow man. Just watch it without any second thoughts... Should have got a theatrical release though...",Sarpatta Parambarai
