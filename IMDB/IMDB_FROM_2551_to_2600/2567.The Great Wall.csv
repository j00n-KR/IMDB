0,Leofwine_draca,Colourful comic book adventure,6,19 June 2017,"THE GREAT WALL is the latest big collaboration between Hollywood and China, telling a LORD OF THE RINGS-style fantasy epic about the defenders of the Great Wall against a horde of alien beasts bent on destruction. As an international production, this features a Hollywood lead cast and a supporting Chinese cast, with the great Andy Lau playing in support as a wise elder.This is one of those films that was heavily criticised by reviewers, unfairly so in my opinion. It's nothing more than a light popcorn film, full of spectacle and not much else, and that's fine by me. The CGI creatures look decent in a comic book style and the big battle sequences are exciting and well-staged. Famed director Zhang Yimou has a really great way of depicting colour in his films and this is a beautiful one to watch, particularly with those multi-coloured stained glass windows at the climax.Matt Damon is the solid, sometimes stolid, lead, his accent wavering between American and pan Scottish-Irish. Pedro Pascal is the comic relief, building on his GAME OF THRONES role. Willem Dafoe has fun as a shadier character, while Tian Jing is one of those typical idealistic young Chinese girls, a martial arts expert and endlessly heroic. THE GREAT WALL is a simple action romp, nothing less and nothing more, and yet it held my attention throughout and offered up something genuinely new.",The Great Wall
1,SnoopyStyle,Chinese monster action with Hollywood stars,6,19 September 2017,"European mercenaries travel east searching for the secrets of black powder. After the lost of twenty men over six months, they are attacked by raiders and then a monster. Survivors Tovar and William (Matt Damon) cut off the monster's hand and arrive at the Great Wall of China. They are taken prisoners as they witness the Chinese Nameless Order defend the wall against a horde of monsters. The monsters, Tao Tei, are the results from a meteor and they attack every sixty years. Commander Lin Mae is able to speak English learning from Ballard (Willem Dafoe) who came 25 years earlier looking for black powder. The two prisoners regain their freedom after showing their skills during the heat of battle.There is a trend for some Chinese movies to use Hollywood stars to sell internationally. It can be an annoying transparent move especially if the story is bent to accommodate them. In this one, their presence makes some sense which helps a lot. The action is fun and ridiculous at first. It becomes more and more tiresome towards the end. After the first fight on the wall, the story could have gone on a quest into the mountains. It would be more compelling and allow more character work. This plot rambles around until it slams into action overload. The CGI work is functional but not at the very top level. The monster design is fine. This is passable as a mindless monster action flick.",The Great Wall

William and Tovar are freed after showing their skills and bravery when the monsters attack. They then team up with the Chinese forces to rid the monster once and for all by attacking the Queen monster.The film always comes across as jarring. It is a muddled fantasy adventure. It only comes better in the action packed latter stages. Matt Damon just looks uncomfortable.",The Great Wall

While escaping with the hand of the monster, they stumble upon the Great Wall and are captured by General Shao (Hanyu Zhang), Commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing), Strategist Wang (Andy Lau) and their army. They are imprisoned in the Great Wall and meet the European Ballard (Willem Dafoe), who was also a mercenary looking for black powder that has been imprisoned in the Great Wall for twenty-five years. Soon they learn that the soldiers are trained to fight monsters called Taotie that attack the humans every sixty years. They are the last outpost protecting the capital. When they suffer attack from the horde of Taoties, William and Tovar also fight helping General Shao. When the Taotie Queen retrieves the horde, they know that they will be massively attacked by the Taoties and their only chance is to kill the Queen. Will the humans survive?""The Great Wall"" is an entertaining and full of action fantasy with beautiful cinematography. The battles have the usual exaggerated computer-generated imagery with an absurd quantity of monsters. The predictable story has no surprises and the mercenary William becomes a hero in the end for helping the Chinese soldiers to defeat the dangerous monsters.

4,nogodnomasters,And here I am,7,29 July 2017,"William (Matt Damon) is an English mercenary who is better with a bow than an accent. He leads a small band of men into China in order to abscond with the legendary black powder. He is chased by a band of men and decides to lose them by traveling north and then runs into the outside of Great Wall...something that confounds my sense of direction. What saves William and his side kick Pero (Pedro Pascal) is that they have the paw of a Taotie, a large CG alien looking creature that travels on all fours. It seems the wall was constructed to keep them out, a group that attacks every 60 years to feed.The scenery and the production was breath taking, at times being of epic proportion. There is a ""love"" aspect which amounts to two people who eye each other. The film is not in any way historical with the wall and the Chinese having weapons that alludes historians.

6,kosmasp,Wall of History,6,13 May 2017,"I have to admit, after all the criticism the movie received and the stigma of a box office failure (although it apparently didn't do so badly overall, especially around the world generally and China specifically), I was expecting a mess. I didn't get that. And I only watched the 2D version of the movie, but you can spot the scenes where they enhanced the visuals for a 3D effect.So while this isn't a masterclass in acting, it's not like it's Razzies worthy either. The effects are really good and there is a lot of action and things blowing up. Stunts wise this looks good and there is not really a story, but that doesn't really matter now does it? You get enough excitement and that's what the movie promised. Nothing more, nothing less",The Great Wall
7,ma-cortes,Spectacular film in which some European mercenaries meet a secret army defending the Great Wall of China against a horde of monsters,6,4 June 2019,"A band of European mercenaries, including William Garin (Matt Damon) and Pero Tovar (Pedro Pascal ) , travel to China during the reign of the Renzong Emperor . Resting in a cave a few miles north of the Great Wall, they are attacked by a monster, leaving only William and Tovar alive. They cut off the monster's leg and bring it with them. The next day, reaching the Wall, they are imprisoned at a stronghold under command General Shao (Hanyu Zhang) , Strategist Wang (Andy Lau) and a Commander : Lin Mae (Tian Jing) . Furthermore , they meet a strange European man called Ballard (Willem Dafoe) . They belong to ¨Nameless Order¨ who exists to combat a horde of alien monsters called Taotieh, which attacks once every sixty years. As they defend the Wall against a horde of monstrous creatures . While examining the severed monster leg, the Order's commanders are surprised by the first assault from the monster horde, one week early. One of mankind's greatest wonders. 1700 years to build. 5500 miles long. What were they trying to keep out?This is a monster movie full of noisy action , bloody combats , groundbreaking attacks , impressive battles and a lot of digital effects . It deals with two European mercenaries in search of the secret to gunpowder and they are taken prisoner by soldiers of the Nameless Order , while confronting an unimaginable and seemingly invincible forcé . Lavishly produced , it was the most expensive Chinese film ever, with a budget of $140 million . The picture relies heavily on the really excessive special effects by 3D Computer Generator with extreme digitalization . The movie contains breathtaking battles , overwhelming fights , spectacular images and a cast of thousands , due to the huge amount of crew involved . The picture is more a monster movie than a historical or Chinese custom yarn .Brilliant cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh and Xiaoding Zhao, including various filming locations , such as New Zealand , Qingdao, China , WanDa Studios, Qingdao, China . However , the producers were denied permission to shot on the real Great Wall, so some landscapes were added digitally. Although the colored mountains and some outdoors in the movie are authentic . And thrilling as well as evocative musical score with oriental sounds by Ramin Djawadi of Game of thrones .The motion picture was professionally directed by the Chinese Zhang Ziyi , though it has some flaws and gaps . Ziyi has established himself firmly as a distinguished filmmaker/producer whose last films have generated millions in China box office . Originally released in 2002 in Asia, it would not be another two years until this film was released in the United States . Studio executives were concerned that the foreign-language film would not be successful at the box office with American audiences . Among fans, this is part of the ""Zhang Ziyi trilogy,"" which includes Hero (2002), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) .

8,tavm,The Great Wall was an awesome epic movie!,10,23 February 2017,"Just watched this Chinese-made epic film with the American Matt Damon in the lead role. He's initially one of the people looking for a ""black powder"" to take away from the rightful owners but finds himself involved in a battle that makes him become something more. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a compelling adventure to watch especially in IMAX and 3-D. Not only is the visuals awesome, but the dialogue is also quite compelling and the music score quite stirring throughout. The colors are also fine when all those battle scenes are being depicted and those creatures don't disappoint, that's for sure! I saw this with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew and we all say, go and watch The Great Wall!",The Great Wall
9,LeonLouisRicci,Pretty Pictures but also Pretty Vacant,6,3 July 2017,"This Distractedly Dumb, Anachronistic, but Beautiful Film is from the most Celebrated, and perhaps Talented Chinese Director. It Solidifies its International Appeal with Americans Matt Damon, Willem Dafoe, and for a bit of Latin Spice, Pedro Pascal. All Three, by the way, are Miscast and seemingly Bored to Tears. The Fantastic Color Schemes and Eye Popping Look of the Film are just Enough to keep it, and by Title, ""The Great Wall"", from Crumbling to Cinematic Dust. Laugh Out Loud Dialog that could easily be Lifted from 80's or 90's Buddy Banter and Zero Appealing Characters that are Dull and Vacant, Burden the Movie from the Get Go.The Action is Virtually Non-Stop and always In Your Face and Breathtaking, and that's a Good Thing. But it's a Bad Thing when the Monsters are so Generic, Derivative, and Bland. Their Numbers are Impressive but Their On-Screen Story and Behavior are Boring, Predictable, and Mind Numbingly Not Engaging or Interesting.The Costumes are Wonderful but ALL the Human Beings Inside are Flat and Vacuous. It's a Film made by a Borderless Committee that is Borderline Bad. It's Not a ""White Savior"" Movie, as it has been Accused. But Overall, aside from the Pretty Pictures, what Remains is a Soulless Sortie in Experimental Movie Marketing to Find a Formula that will put the most Money in the most Pockets for Everyone but the Masses of Humanity that Need it the Most.",The Great Wall
10,zardoz-13,"Pathetic Monsters, Predictable Plot, & Poor Suspense!!!",1,26 February 2017,"Creature features like Chinese director Zhang Yimou's sprawling $150 million fantasy epic ""The Great Wall"" must bristle with monsters that not only send a chill down your spine but also paralyze you with fear. Sadly, neither Yimou, who helmed ""House of Flying Daggers,"" nor his lackluster special effects team have conjured up monsters that would frighten a cat. The toothy but mange-ridden reptilian quadruples that swarm over, around, and under the eponymous wall resemble a horde of demented Tasmanian devils. Mind you, these predators hunt like ravenous wolves, but they look far more hilarious than intimidating. When a multi-million-dollar movie sinks a fortune on such an egregious example of monsters, you'd think the producers would have shown greater imagination. Why actors as respected as Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe would grace this expensive, but lame-brained, hybrid Hollywood/Chinese co-production with their presence remains baffling, too. ""The Great Wall"" evoked memories of the abysmal Keanu Reeves escapade ""47 Ronin"" (2013) because both movies depicted how a European outsider intervened to save Asians from virtual annihilation. Mind you, ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" scribes Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro along with ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" scribe Tony Gilroy have concocted a premise about Medieval European mercenaries--Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal, and Willem Dafoe— drifting around China on a quest for the fabled gunpowder. Naturally, the Chinese refuse to share the secret of gunpowder with these barbarians since it constituted the equivalent of a nuclear bomb in the bow & arrow era. Eventually, our outcast heroes find refuge within the ranks of an army of intrepid Chinese warriors after Damon's mercenary protagonist miraculously manages to slay one of these absurd beasts. Worse than its Rat Fink-style monsters, ""The Great Wall"" generates minimal suspense and few surprises with its preposterously formulaic plot. Once you lay your eyes on these bogus Tao Tei monsters you may clamor for a refund on your ticket. William (Matt Damon of ""The Bourne Identity"") and Tovar (Pedro Pascal of ""Hermanas"") have spent their entire lives on the battlefield and dispatched adversaries with as little regard for them as we might stomp cockroaches. Having embarked on an ambitious journey to the Far East, our heroes set out to acquire the legendary black powder that will escalate combat to a more devastating intensity. Unfortunately, attrition in form of marauding enemies as well as enigmatic creatures has whittled their numbers down until only William and Tovar remain. At one point, three of their comrades vanish under suspicious circumstances, and William slashes a big, green claw off something that he cannot see. Our heroic duo doesn't last long in the sprawling Gobi Desert before Chinese soldiers of the Nameless Order surround and usher them off to their leaders. General Shao (Hanyu Zhang of ""White Vengeance"") and his second-in-command Lin Mae (Ting Jing of ""Police Story: Lockdown"") have assembled a massive army atop a gargantuan wall where they maintain surveillance on the surrounding countryside. They interrogate William and Tovar and are prepared to execute them as intruders until they discover the severed claw of a Tao Tei monster among William's belongings. They change their attitude about these two and let them live. As it turns out, another European, Ballard (Willem Dafoe of ""John Wick""), who has been a Chinese prisoner for about 25 years, blundered unbidden into their land in search of black powder, too. They didn't kill him, and during that time, Ballard has taught Lin Mae how to speak English.No sooner have the Chinese captured our heroes than William and Tovar collaborate secretly with Ballard about an escape plan. Initially, something stands in their way. A scourge of hideous reptiles endowed with surprising intelligence has been plaguing China. These fiendish creatures show up every 60 years with regularity, and a queen supervises their activities by means of sound vibrations. As Strategist Wang (Andy Lau of ""Infernal Affairs"") explains it, these carnivores have been terrorizing China for 22 centuries because one emperor wallowed in greed so wanton that a meteor crashed into a mountain and unleashed this pestilence. Consequently, the Chinese constructed the 'Great Wall' to contend with this blight, but they have achieved only minimal success, despite having an arsenal gun powder that they deploy in explosives of various dimensions. Furthermore, these beasts, with eyes located in their shoulders and heads bristling with a porcupine of deadly teeth, have learned over the years how to adapt to the strategies that the Chinese have devised to kill them. William finds himself at a turning point during this predicament. He discovers that fighting for wealth no longer motivates him as an individual. Instead, he learns from the noble Numberless Order that trust supersedes money. Meantime, all Tovar wants is to escape with Ballard; Ballard has been plotting his escape, and he has a route and parcels of the explosive black powder to take back to Europe. During a confrontation on the wall with these monsters, General Shao is mortally wounded by a Tao Tei, and he passes command of the army to Lin Mae. Lin Mae finds herself in an even worse situation than General Shao because the Tao Tei have figured out that it is the cities rather than the great wall where they should concentrate their energy. The Tao Tei stop attacking the wall and swarm off to the capital like an inexorable horde to eat the emperor. The evil Tao Tei queen with her tiara and her inner circle of lizard bodyguards that sprout shields to protect her is truly hilarious. Lin Mae and a few select soldiers pilot ancient balloons to fly to the capital to save the Emperor. William decides to risk his life on this perilous expedition while Tovar and Ballard escape with quantities of gun powder. Despite being the most expensive Chinese movie ever produced with a distinguished cast of Asian actors, ""The Great Wall"" resembles something that the goofy SyFy Channel would have cooked up to top its sophomoric ""Sharknado"" sagas.",The Great Wall
11,view_and_review,Not Great But Solid,7,20 February 2017,"When I saw the trailers for this movie I thought, ""I can't wait to see this!""Then, shortly after the movie began I thought, ""Oh no. Where is this movie going?"" The reason I thought that is due to years of certain tropes that have been repeated in American cinema. The movie started with a group of westerners in a foreign land evading some natives. The westerners, although not there for altruistic reasons, seemed to be more sophisticated, brave and resourceful while the natives seemed more barbaric and uncivilized. Not long after that there was the meeting of the two main characters: William (Matt Damon) and Commander Lin (Tian Jing). Now I began to think, ""Here we go again. This beautiful foreign woman will fall for this western man because of his courage, bravery, sensitivity, etc."" I was all set to gag.Happily, the movie didn't fall into those clichés. Yes, William was brave and skillful. Yes, a relationship did develop between he and Commander Lin but not one of the rehashed version we've seen so much.I thought the movie was an excellent display of the traditional Chinese martial arts type movies that are big productions with beautifully contrasting colors, synchronous choreography and stylized fighting. They married that with the Western style of individualism and the internal struggle between doing for self and doing for others.The movie was as advertised. The CGI beasts were formidable as nemeses and gave a real sense of desperation. The acting was good and the cinematography was as well. The Great Wall wasn't great but it was solid.",The Great Wall
12,george.schmidt,If you need to then by all means see it in 3-D and as big a screen as you can to dig the Circus de Soleil machinations at hand.,7,22 February 2017,"THE GREAT WALL (2017) **1/2 Matt Damon, Tian Jing, Willem Dafoe, Andy Lau, Pedro Pascal, Hanyu Zhang, Lu Han, Kenny Lin. Lavishly epic sci-fi action flick set at China's Great Wall with Damon a tad miscast as a gung-ho mercenary who unwittingly finds himself at the edifice preparing battle against a rampaging horde of monstrous beasts hellbent at destroying mankind. While director Yimou Zhang employs a vast quantity and quality with amazing production values the film suffers in its bloat and the hit-and-miss CGI (the monsters are a mix of Ray Harryhausen nightmare and nearly ludicrous Dr. Seuss concoctions) and the somewhat stiff screenplay by Carlo Bernard, Doug Miro, Tony Gilroy , Max Brooks, Edward Zwick & Marshall Herskovitz doesn't help in the long run. If you need to then by all means see it in 3-D and as big a screen as you can to dig the Circus de Soleil machinations at hand.",The Great Wall
13,neil-476,"Big dumb - no, insance - fun",8,15 May 2018,"If, like me, you thought the Great Wall of China was built to keep out Genghis Khan and his horde of ravaging Mongols, think again. It turns out that it was actually built to keep out about 90 million oxen-sized, lightning fast, razor-toothed, savagely carnivorous dragon/wolf thingies which came to Earth on a meteor.So Matt Damon and his Spanish buddy are the last two survivors of a group of mercenaries touring China with the intention of pilfering a load of black powder. They have the misfortune to end up at the Great Wall just as the fearsome beasties called Tao Tei are about to launch one of their cyclic - every 60 years - attacks. The Chinese forces, while courageous and well trained, are ultimately outclassed: the Tao Tei are incredibly difficult to kill, necessitating such imaginative battle tactics as the blue-cloaked female troops bungee jumping from the walls to spear them from above. Fortunately, Matt Damon is an incredible archer, tactician, and warrior generally. Less fortunately, all he wants to do is steal a sackful of black powder and leg it.This big budget Chinese production - Damon's casting has been criticised, but he is clearly present primarily to boost the international box office - has every yuan spent on it clearly displayed on screen - it is absolutely spectacular and, often, quite beautiful.It is also completely bonkers. Seriously, bats in the attic bonkers. The indescribable masses of unbeatable toothsome critters defy credibility, as do the immensely entertaining combat methods embraced by the beautifully costumed cast, both principals, extras, and CGI extras.The CGI Tao Tei do get a bit wearisome towards the end, by virtue of their vast numbers if nothing else, but we have a small group of gritty individuals who we can root for. But will they all survive?And is there going to be any romance between Matt Damon's William and the incredibly cute Commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing)? After all, she despises him, and that's how it usually starts, right?The 3D, while by no means essential, has some lovely 3D moments in it.There is no more substance to this film than there is to the contents of one of the hot-air balloons which feature towards the end, but that's not a reason not to enjoy it, because it's a hell of a popcorn movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and, half an hour later, I was ready for another one.",The Great Wall
14,Uriah43,A Rather Unusual Movie,7,5 September 2018,"This rather unusual movie begins with a small band of Europeans mercenaries riding on horseback to the Far East in a quest to bring back the secret of gunpowder to their respective countries. Along the way they are attacked by Khitan bandits and those that manage to survive are forced to take refuge in a cave. They then discover a monster lurking in this cave which manages to kill all but two of them before the leader of the mercenaries named ""William Garin"" (Matt Damon) cuts off one of the monster's hands and kills it. After leaving the cave both William and ""Pero Tovar"" (Pedro Pascal) are captured by Chinese troops and taken to a fortress situated upon a portion of the Great Wall. It's then that they are told of the identity of the monster and not long afterward are horrified to see a great multitude of them assembling for an attack upon the fortress. Fortunately, the Chinese army within the fortress has been preparing for this event for almost 60 years and even though the conflict is extremely fierce they manage to prevail-at least for the time-being. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting action film which made good use of CGI and the cultural differences between European and Oriental societies. Likewise, having a gorgeous actress like Jing Tian (as ""Commander Lin Mai"") was an added bonus as well. Even so, the plot itself was rather predictable and I didn't expecially care for the ending that much either. But all thing's considered, I thought it was certainly entertaining enough and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Great Wall
15,FlashCallahan,The not as bad as you'd think Wall.....,7,19 February 2017,"two mercenaries from the West are captured by a military organisation that are headquartered in a fortress on the Great Wall.In time, the duo get caught up in a battle between the Chinese warriors and a supernatural menace that the Great Wall was built to repel....First things first, The Great Wall is a stupidly over the top film, and it will have it's fair share of haters. In fact, you could call it this years Jupiter Ascending.So if you do decide to see this at the cinema, find the biggest, loudest screen you can find, and see it in 3D, because here it really adds depth to an otherwise very flat film.Damon appears to be coasting through the film, in fact, it's one of his most stilted performances, so luckily the rest of the cast really get into the cheesy script, and make the most of it.Dafoe pops up every now and again to chew as much scenery as the beasts that are attacking the titular wall, and adds nothing to the film.The film is basically and opening battle, a long Last Samurai type middle where the two opposing sides gain respect for each other, and the final climactic battle, which features hot air balloon attacks, Magnets, and good old black powder.It is a load of old cobblers, but I wasn't bored in the slightest, but that's maybe to the 3D being really quite effective, or wondering where Damon's character originated from.This would make a great double bill with 1999's The 13th Warrior, another film that is frustratingly entertaining...",The Great Wall
16,phd_travel,A good balance of East and West,7,9 January 2017,"First of all this is a movie about fighting monsters - not a fact based historical epic. So don't take it that seriously and you'll have an okay time. The great wall is the center of a fight against some invading dragon dinosaur like creatures.There have been criticisms of having a white hero in the lead role. But it's just a monster movie so take it easy. There should have been more of the ""saving"" done by Chinese characters but to be fair they did make the white people look scruffy and the Chinese ones pretty/handsome. Matt Damon does look kind of short and puffy here compared to the Chinese cast. Liked Pedro Pascal the excellent detective Pena from Narcos as Matt's partner in crime. Tian Jing is a feisty enough female commander. So all is fair race wise in this war.Overall there is a good balance between East and West. A Western screenplay by Max Brooks keeps things going quickly without the irritating self sacrifice and slow dialog of the recent Jackie Chan Adrien Brody movie. Director Zhang Yimou is known for extravaganzas and sometimes the action does look circus acrobat like. But it's not too bad - the excessive slow motion deaths and explosions that plague some Chinese movies isn't such a problem here.",The Great Wall
17,trashgang,excellent,8,17 March 2017,"Have seen the trailer I was attracted towards this flick. So off we go to see what's it all about. Being directed by a Chinese and the words Great Wall I knew that it wasn't going to be a typical Hollywood flick. And that the Chinese wall would be in it was clear too.But what I saw wasn't what I was thinking I was going to see. This is pure science-fiction. It all starts normal with white people going to search for the black powder. But suddenly at night they are being attacked by some kind of creature. And it's all about that creature, to be honest, thousands of them.The effects used are really well done. Naturally you will have the typical Chinese way of directing towards fighting scene's. Yes, they are flying through the air. You know what I mean. Also what I liked was the fact that you can feel that there's love in the air but it never takes the main lead so it's pure an adventure flick. I liked it and it was a big surprise toward the story.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Great Wall

But rating it as low as possible is just too ridiculous for words. A seven to me is a movie that I would watch again in the future, a six a movie that isn't bad but that I wouldn't watch again, a four is just a movie I didn't like at all, a one is the worst movie possible. And clearly even if you didn't like The Great Wall just rate it a four then. The lowest possible makes me wonder how many movies you watched in your life. I thought The Great Wall was an enjoyable movie to watch, with a nice fictional fantasy story. The CGI's where okay so even that you couldn't fault. Matt Damon is always good so here also you couldn't write anything bad. If you like a bit of fantasy with some action than you should give this movie a chance.

It does require a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but it's all fun.The story is also filled with project management gotchas: it doesn't matter how good your solution is if it is not implemented by the deadline, always test your solutions or you will crash and burn, solutions for individual problems may fail under stress tests, etc.Bottom line: it was like Cowboys and Aliens, only pandering to the Chinese audience and with grandiose special effects that were not that 3D, but were quite entertaining.",The Great Wall
20,JamesHitchcock,Very watchable as long as you don't take it too seriously,7,2 January 2021,"This is the first English-language film by the distinguished Chinese director Zhang Yimou (although there is also some English dialogue in his earlier ""The Flowers of War""). Zhang is noted for his period dramas such as ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero"", which can be seen as the Chinese equivalent of Western ""heritage cinema"". ""The Great Wall"" is also set against the backdrop of Chinese history, although unlike the films referred to above it also contains some fantasy and science-fiction elements.The action takes place in the 11th century AD, during the reign of the Emperor Renzong of Song (1022-1063). A party of European explorers have been making their way to China in search of the secret gunpowder. Nearing the Great Wall they are attacked by a monster and only two, an Englishman named William Garin and a Spaniard named Pero Tovar, survive. Garin and Tovar manage to reach the Wall, which they find garrisoned by a formidable Chinese army awaiting an attack. The enemy they are expecting, however, is no human force but a horde of monsters known as the Tao Tei. (It was a Tao Tei which attached Garin and Tovar's party). We are given to understand that the Tao Tei are beings from another planet, although the Chinese believe them to have been sent by Heaven as a punishment for the greed and cruelty of an Emperor who ruled some 2,000 years earlier. Garin agrees to help the Chinese in their fight against the Tao Tei, although Tovar remains obsessed with the idea of stealing gunpowder and returning to Europe.Although this was an American and Chinese co-production with a Chinese director and a predominantly Chinese cast, some have criticised it as a ""white saviour"" movie. That, however, strikes me as a misconception, unless the phrase ""white saviour"" is interpreted as meaning ""Matt Damon or some other major international film star who will save the movie at the Western box office"". Although the Chinese admire William's courage and skill as a warrior- he is an accomplished archer- they have plenty of courageous and skilled warriors of their own, and do not need a white man to save them, especially as their military technology and organisation are more advanced than anything which European armies would have possessed at this time.In some ways, in fact, it is William who is ""saved"" by the Chinese. Before coming to China he was a mercenary who would only fight for money and who would happily betray his comrades if he received a better offer from the enemy. The Chinese soldiers, however, fight for one another and for their country, and William gradually comes to learn from them that this is something more noble than fighting for purely selfish reasons.The film is not as visually beautiful as some of Zhang's earlier movies such as ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"", which both made very subtle and symbolic use of colour, although some of the battle scenes have a certain balletic grace, especially those involving a regiment of women who descend on cranes in order to attack the Tao Tei from above. (Men, we are told, are too heavy for this work).An important element in the film is the relationship which grows up between William and Commander Lin Mae, the beautiful and surprisingly youthful leader of these female soldiers. This relationship does not, however, develop into the expected romance; at the end of the film William wants to return to England and Lin, who has now been promoted to General, still has important work to do in China. If the two have feelings for one another, they have to put them aside. (I doubt if in real life a society as male-dominated as Imperial China would have employed women in its armed forces, let alone promoted them to General while still in their twenties, but there is a tradition in Chinese martial arts movies of female characters who are not only glamorous but also strong, brave and capable).The look of the film was undoubtedly influenced by Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (which has influenced most fantasy films made in the 21st century), especially during the battle sequences. It doesn't have the intellectual and philosophical depth of Jackson's masterpiece, or indeed of some of Zhang's earlier films which I would also rank as masterpieces, but it still arouses a good deal of excitement and is very watchable as long as you don't take it too seriously. 7/10",The Great Wall
21,Hellmant,It's just a shame they couldn't have cast an Asian actor in the lead.,7,24 February 2017,"'THE GREAT WALL': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A big-budget historical fantasy from director Zhang Yimou; marking the first English-language film directed by the popular Chinese filmmaker (who's also helmed such beloved Chinese cinema classics as 2002's 'HERO' and 2004's 'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS'). The movie stars Matt Damon, as a European mercenary that helps defenders of the Great Wall of China fight off ancient monsters (during the Song dynasty). It also costars Pedro Pascal, Jing Tian, Willem Dafoe and Andy Lau (who also costarred in 'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS'). The film was written by a team of six writers (including filmmaker Edward Zwick), and it's been accused of whitewashing (by telling another white savior tale); Zwick also directed and co-wrote 'THE LAST SAMAURAI', which was also accused of white washing (for the same reason). It's been a hit at the international Box Office (so far), but it's also gotten mostly negative reviews from critics. I mostly enjoyed it, despite it's obvious flaws. The story takes place in ancient China, during the Song dynasty, when a group of European mercenaries are searching for black powder there (just a few miles north of the Great Wall). After the team is attacked by bandits, and an unknown monster, only William (Damon) and Tovar (Pascal) remain alive. The two then come across the Great Wall, and are captured there. They soon learn that a military order, that defends the Wall, is preparing for an invasion from an army of the same kind of monster that attacked them. The military is later impressed by the duo's fighting abilities, and they enlist their help in their war. William and Tovar reluctantly agree to assist them, while also planning to rob them.The movie is filled with pretty impressive action scenes, and beautifully stunning visuals (like all of Yimou's films). It definitely seems Americanized though, and I definitely sympathize with those that are offended by it. Still, it is entertaining (in a fun B-monster flick way), and somewhat funny. Damon, Pascal, Tian, Lau, Dafoe and the others are all good in the movie as well. It's just a shame they couldn't have cast an Asian actor in the lead.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",The Great Wall
22,cherold,Entertaining hokum,7,20 July 2017,"If you're a visionary Chinese filmmaker eager to pull in big American *and* Chinese dollars, what would you do? Maybe make a movie with an American star about weird dinosaur things attacking the Great Wall of China? That's what Yimou Zhang went with.I always check out the latest action picture from Zhang, continually hoping for another Hero or House of Daggers and always coming away disappointed. Alas, he may never manage that again.Still, as non-Hero Zhang action movies go, The Great Wall is pretty fun. The visuals are amazing, with swarms of beasts climbing towers, red arrows and blue outfits set against muted backgrounds, and a final sequence distinguished by an amazing tower of stained glass windows. There are some terrific action scenes, notably one in the foggy smoke of battle in which creatures appear with bracing suddenness.The human element in the film is somewhat weaker. There is a weird stilted quality in the English dialogue, although I'm not sure if it's the writing or the acting. While the banter between Damon and Pedro Pascal is sometimes amusing, they have little bro-chemistry. The character development is surprisingly weak from a director who, when he's not doing big-budget action, does lovely, small-budget human drama. I suppose it's hard to do both (although Zhang managed it in Flowers of War).I do give the movie points for establishing a chemistry between Damon and the pretty spear chucker and then keeping their relationship professional. That's about as un-Hollywood as you can get.Anyway, this is a fun popcorn flick with some great visuals and an epic scale. No, there's not a moment as good as the best moments in Hero, but even Zhang's worst films have something worth watching, and this is far from his worst (which for me, BTW, would be A Woman, A Gun, and a Noodle Shop).Check it out. Just keep your expectations low and you'll have a good time.",The Great Wall

While the passive experience of 'The Great Wall (2016)' itself wasn't at all painful, the fact that it was so freakishly forgettable should really tell you all you need to know. The picture occasionally toes the line of being just a bit 'white-saviour-y', with Matt Damon's intermittently Irish mercenary mostly coming in and saving the day, but it doesn't quite come across as a complete cultural ravaging, especially considering the large Chinese cast and crew as well as the relatively well-implemented subtitled segments. It ends on a contrived but necessary note of supportive teamwork, amidst a sea of nearly-neon, primary-coloured power-ranger armour and desperately dodgy digital doubles.

25,richardchatten,Girls Wear Blue,6,19 March 2017,"I actually find the idea that the Great Wall of China was built to keep out alien invaders rather fun; and if you can buy that, the story that follows isn't too hard to take. The basic narrative of 'The Great Wall' has seen service before in classics like 'Zulu' and 'Assault on Precinct 13', while the monsters (collectively called the Tao Tei) are the usual slavering CGI nightmares with rows of ferocious teeth; the later emphasis on the strategic role of their queen recalling 'Starship Troopers'.Set in the 11th Century, the action is fast, furious and very noisy; with predictable pauses for the occasional bit of hushed Eastern-style philosophising. Ironically it's when the action transfers from the Great Wall itself to the capital that it becomes much more interesting to look at, the capital providing a far better backdrop for veteran director Zhang Yimou to display the bold use of colour for which he is renowned (most notably in a climactic scene set in a tower inevitably lined with stained glass windows).The return to the capital by balloon of Commander Lin Mae of the Crane Troop (Jing Tian) with her female comrades-in-arms is another visual highlight, and throughout the film it's good to see women serving on the front line (in blue, for a change, with matching capes), albeit usually in the background; and Lin Mae's armour as Commander doesn't seem to have been designed to immediately distinguish her from her subordinates.",The Great Wall
26,bowmanblue,Its middle name is 'action',7,24 January 2019,"I'm writing a review of 'The Great Wall' a day after I've watched it. I fear that if I leave it much longer I probably won't remember much about it. Apart from the action. There's a lot of action. I'll probably be mentioning action quite a lot over the following paragraphs. Sorry.I'm guessing 'The Great Wall' is hardly what you'd call 'historically accurate' as - apparently - that big ol' wall in ancient China was actually built to keep out the monsters. Which monsters? Well, a whole army of green scaly computer-generated ones which charge obediently into human fire.And, these mean old beasties are doing pretty well for themselves, despite the fact that a beautifully-dressed army of Chinese warriors have pledged their lives to defending the wall and the nation it protects. Luckily for all us two-legged types, Matt Damon (and another bloke) arrive one day to sort this mess out.The whole film is 'by the numbers.' And, before you think I'm totally slating it for being so generic, wait - because it's actually quite fun. Yes, its plot is wafer-thin and if you ever seen any film ever then you'll know every plot point that comes, i.e. one of the Chinese warriors is a beautiful woman who is ripe to fall for Damon's western charm. There's the protective father figure who... okay, just on the off-chance you can't guess what happens to him, I won't spoil it for you.I mentioned the uniforms the human wear because I was particularly impressed with them. I doubt this film would ever receive an Oscar is a million years, but I reckon whoever designed the costumes should at least get a nod here and there. However, what the film has in costumes it lacks in computer effects. Yes, it's clearly got a budget and that's gone on creating vast backdrops and waves upon waves of mindless baddies. However, it's pretty obvious and, unless you're not that bothered about iffy effects, you'll definitely know when the actors are in front (and probably fighting) in front of a green-screen.Basically, if you're looking for a film that has loads of battles where armies of humans fight hordes of monsters then you'll get that right here.

This act of courage catches the eye of the generals and William changes from being an outlaw and a thief to a defender and leader. This is a movie that is hard to talk about. The premise isn't all that terrible, but the movie is so over the top cheesy that all of the drama is lost in the laughter. The best part about the movie is that it moves quick and there is a lot of action. On the other hand, the action and the creature battles are the cheesiest parts of the movie.

30,tabuno,"An Exotic, Meaningful Epic Action Movie",9,11 January 2019,"28 February 2017. As an Asian American, it's hard to avoid having an affinity for a big epic movie that has so much Chinese participation in its development. Nevertheless, the Chinese locale and the exotic landscapes, set designs, and the different historical and cultural ambiance is enthrallingly different and compelling in their big screen presentation. If there is a message hidden in this movie, it's that the fusion of American and Chinese cultures could become a valuable outcome. While the American, Matt Damon, could be considered a hero, it doesn't come without his own transformation and identification to some extent with his association with the Chinese.Reminiscent of Kevin Costner's Best Picture Oscar's Dance with Wolves (1990) and Tom Cruise's Golden Globe Best Actor nominee's The Last Samurai (2003), The Great Hall offers up the cultural clashes of old versus new, of the old way of life clashing with the modern, American notion of progress that swept away many people, families in its path. The Great Wall is sweeping in its scope, the vistas are amazingly huge and awesome, the Chinese warriors and their culture, weapons, and sophistication of the time intriguingly surprising and appealing. The major role of women in the movie can't be ignore, nor the apparent appeal to one's society, family, and friendship over individual greed and money.This is a worthy collaboration between two major, global countries that offers together something valuable and important to people's of both countries.",The Great Wall
31,The-Sarkologist,An American Film set in China,5,17 February 2017,"There seemed to be a lot of lead up to this film that, in the end, pretty much turned out to be another mindless action flick. Mind you, the cinema I saw this film in had reclining seats, which was pretty cool, but that also meant that the number of people that could watch it were somewhat less, making the price of the tickets more. Still, that is somewhat irrelevant to the film itself. The thing was that when I discovered that the film was directed by a Chinese director made me think that it might have some classic Hong Kong cinema elements in it – it didn't.As I have summed it up in the title, this is basically an American film set in China, with quite a few Chinese actors because, well, it is set in China. Actually, there are only three European characters in the film, and they are basically here for one reason and one reason only – to steal a weapon to take back to Europe. However, they suddenly find themselves caught up in a huge battle for survival. Here, they could have actually introduced some Chinese style monsters and such, but they didn't – they were basically reptilian monsters, which I have to admit that somewhat of a let down.Okay, they had Matt Damon and a couple of other Europeans in the film, and honestly, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, the tag line 'what were they trying to keep out' gave the suggestion that maybe there was going to be something a with a lot more Asian character to it, or even some horror elements. However, while they tried to make it sound like these creatures were sent from heaven to punish an arrogant emperor, it is pretty clear that these things weren't ghosts, demons, or somesuch, but were rather alien creatures that had somehow found their way to Earth.Mind you, the film itself was entertaining, and certainly worth the couple of hours in the cinema watching it (as I seem to be doing a lot lately), however it is really only one to watch if you really like these types of films, or have nothing else you really want to see.",The Great Wall
32,Reno-Rangan,"Decent visuals, but has no fresh vision.",3,14 August 2017,"I always thought what they call the great wall of China is the symbol of the Chinese scary-ism against the mighty Mongolians in the ancient time. So when I first saw this trailer, I shocked and then I said: what the heck. You can't just hide the truth and recreate whatever new thing you want. But That's how the China and Chinese evolved for thousands of years. Like it could be martial arts, rice, noodles or the dragon, all of them came from outside. Then when I saw the film, the first scene itself cleared my doubt. It states the film was based on the legend. I thought it was a good start after the misleading promos.So this is China's effort to make a product at home par with Hollywood. They had hired top technicians from the west, that's including Matt Damon. With this kind of attempt, they should have triumphed. Yeah, the graphics were good and then if you check it out the end credits, it was actually not a pure Chinese made product as what we see on the screen, which was 99 per cent Chinese cast. 'Kung Fu Yoga' is a fine example, what the made in China looks like.The director is known for traditional films, like mixing art, martial arts and culture, particularly the middle age. I like his films of the 00s, but this one was utterly commercial crap. When it comes to the ideas for the scenes, every segment and every frame reminded me some Hollywood's greatest graphic film from the recent decade. Particularly the monsters as the zombies from 'World War Z' and the Chinese soldiers totally replicates the Elves of Woodland Realm. That proves, the Chinese are masters of copying/duplicating. IT HAS A DECENT VISUAL, BUT NOT FRESH VISION. They should have handed it over entirely, except producing it for the better outcome.It is the early 11th century, at one of the sections of northern China wall, where a couple of white men caught by the Chinese army after they were chased by a group of bandits. They have come with an agenda, but there's something big is going on. First, they have to win the Chinese trust and so they succeed on that, but things changes as the weather of the place has changed. Besides, they have no choice than to cooperate with them, but then the differences divide the two men. Who takes what path and their fates are decided at the film's climax.❝They have trained all their lives for this war.❞Many western actors, filmmakers had tried their luck in Chinese filmdom, but not all were succeeded. Tapping Chinese market is not that simple. There are too many complications like restriction in thematic and using content in the story. If that complies, then they must use Chinese cast and crew for some percentage. From all, the greatest surprise was, like Jimmy Kimmel said, why would Damon had given up the Oscar award winning role from his own production for this cheap flick from the east.I always appreciate the good films, no matter where it had come from. It all depends on the quality and the contents, but sometimes there is exemption if the production was under a limited, small cost. There's no such excuse for this film. Besides my issue was not the graphics, except borrowing the ideas from others, but it was the poor screenplay. You can clearly say that I'm not happy with this one. This is just another film that looks like a computer game as similar to the 'Resident Evil' film series.The west had given up on digital 3D, but China has a special obsession with that, and so am I. That is the reason those failed films, bet against the Dollars, which were strongly influenced by that technology, such as 'Age of Extinction', 'Warcraft' et cetera survived by earning Yuan. Like I mentioned, the director is not this kind of cheap filmmaker. But it clearly understandable that he wanted to give what the domestic audience wanted, a good digital 3D film. For that, it has to be full scale action-adventure, not filled with drama kind he's famous for.This film lacks character developments, as well as the story. You might enjoy it if you like actions. Even though, many of them are silly like acrobat women jumping down to just kill one-two monsters. On the other hand, they are the baits without followup strategic offense. Hence well planned suicide. Like that, they just wanted to give some actions without any logic behind. The common man like Chinese people (Common means Communism; definition) might be fooled, not the rest of the world. So this film is not everybody's suitable. It is a watchable film, but why?

I am not faulting the film or Hollywood for ""whitewashing"" like having Matt Damon star as a main character in a Chinese big budget film. Sure, there are others like Willem Dafoe in it. At least, they had a story involving a group of mercenaries led by William (Matt Damon) on a search for black powder. Roaming across the north of the Great Wall. William and his group are chased by bandits, taking refuge in a camp. Only to get attacked by a monster, only leaving William and Tovar (Pedro Pascal). They get picked up by a Chinese military led by Commander Lin (Jing Tian). Where they are stationed on the Great Wall, trying to defend it and preventing a wave of monsters from crossing to the capital. The pros about the film, I sure do love a film that is non-stop action, which The Great Wall does so well. It has plenty of action and battles throughout. Even in the beginning of the film, the Chinese army has their ""flying angels"" that are tied to retractable ropes as they leap off the wall to attack from above and to incline back on top. Which can be pretty cool and neat. For director Zhang Yimou, the action and battle sequences can be a bit repetitive after the first attack. There is nothing new added to the table that made the battle exciting. It was well paced, but it cannot go for so long until you really do not care about what will happen next. The visual effects were decent, the set design and costume design were okay. Visual effects on the explosions were noticeable that it was cgi than practical. The creature design was neat. And the effects with creating a mass array of an army as they charged towards the wall and were climbing on top of each other to get on top. Kind of reminded me from that one scene from World War Z film. During the climax of the film that is set at the Captial, it was endless action, I thought some of the fights were cheesy as Lin and her people were on hot balloon crafts fighting from above, and over the villages. The film is all about trying to be entertaining at least. The script does leave out character development, which does not give enough time to engage in these characters besides knowing the two main leads are on search for black powder. And they are stuck in the middle of this battle. By the time it ends, you still would not even know these characters names.Overall, The Great Wall is a fair fantasy film. Not really focused on a developing story or characters. But does throw some neat concepts and entertaining battle sequences that would be worth checking out.",The Great Wall

36,eddie_baggins,A silly film that takes itself far too seriously,2,20 June 2017,"A big deal in a behind the scenes sense as a co-production between a Hollywood studio and its Chinese counterparts, The Great Wall looks to close the gap on the differentials that separate the increasingly blurred line between the American film industry and the booming Chinese film marketplace but this big budgeted action/fantasy is a limp and lifeless affair that will fail to be remembered in either territory.It's a shame that The Great Wall is such a forgettable film, as its famed director Yimou Zhang is a director with runs on the board.Films like Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower all showcase the skills the Chinese born director possesses but while his eye for visual detail and extravagance is sometimes on show here, The Great Wall's various CGI fuelled battle scenes where Matt Damon's ponytailed hero William Garin takes it to a bunch of mutated alien dogs are all relatively ho-hum affairs. While the films chances of having any type of emotional core or wins outside of providing visual candy are lost within a dire script and silly story that never threatens to become an entertaining entity.From the moment we're thrust into the film and transported to Garin and his merry band of mercenary like soldiers roaming around the landscape of ancient China trying to find ""black powder"" only to instead be thrown into a war between humans and vicious hungry alien canines with eyes on their legs, you know things are going to get rather ridiculous fairly quickly but The Great Wall also commits the mortal sin of trying far too hard to be serious we're it should've let the silliness of the whole situation take over.Damon, in one of his most forgettable turns in sometime, brings nothing to the role of Garin while Zhang feels like his directing the film as a by the numbers procedural with very little to none of the flair his shown with his previous action adventures, while the very idea of this story being told in a serious fashion ruins the fun we could've had witnessing over the top battles held on the very foundations of one of the world's most recognisable and famous wonders.Final Say – The Great Wall is a downright dumb film that takes itself far too seriously. Devoid of any visual spectacle that can become a selling point and featuring a surely embarrassed Hollywood lead, Zhang's Hollywood/China crossover gets the whole idea of such joint projects off to an extremely rocky and lacklustre start.1 ponytail out of 5",The Great Wall
37,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,3,5 February 2017,"The great wall was not a movie about the great wall. Rather, it's about some alien (?) creatures that attack the wall, aiming to destroy the capital. They look like some animals from the Avatar movie, though they have their own intelligence and they are moved by their queen. So, the basic idea behind the movie is kind of interesting, however, it never develops as it is never fully explained. Of course the movie has no historical base, judging from the fact that two westerners who speak zero Chinese help the Chinese army out. And of course the later are so impressed by their skills that they even offer them some short of leadership in the army. Fortunately the whole non historical accuracy doesn't really harm the movie. But, that can't be said about the special effects, though the battle techniques were quite impressive. However, those too sum up to be very tiring in the end, as you only watch war machinery and clever gadgets that kind of remind the lord of the rings movies. Now, for the performances, the actors were okay, though the Chinese- English dialogues were annoying (please, just choose one language! preferably Chinese) and they cost the movie favourable points. Finally, the ending was short even though it's better than having battle after battle that would have prolonged the ending and have just increased the length to the point of boredom. So, 3 out of 10, because, even though it is an enjoyable movie, it's not surely one that will be remembered the next day on.

A collaboration between film heavyweights Hollywood and China where the results determine the future of marketing films, domestic against worldwide. The results were fine, but I can't see it happening again. The Great Wall of China was built to protect its lands, not just from human invaders, but from mythical beasts known as the Tao Tieh. Two European mercenaries are captured and prove their skills in the aid of defending China. This is a Zhang Yimou blockbuster, if you've seen his previous films then you'll know he is big on style. Gloriously vibrant colours to create memorable scenes, he does the exact same here. The green of the Tao Tieh against the red fires and grey architecture, he turns films into spectacles. The costume design was magnificent and easily the highlight of the technical aspects. Each unique group, where they have specialised skills, of The Nameless Order wear differing coloured armour to differentiate themselves. The commanding offices wore unique breastplate symbols and helmets which really enhanced the ancient Chinese setting that Yimou created. It reminded me of the video game 'Dynasty Warriors' so I can see there is continuity and consistency in the attire of Chinese military orders. The story is as formulaic as one might expect. Defend the wall from waves of enemies until they take out the Queen. It's uninspired unfortunately. Matt Damon's accent was all over the place and the ""feelings"" between his character and Commander Lin felt forced for the sake of emotional investment...to which there was none. The excessive dependence on visual effects meant that occasionally the CGI looked slightly rushed, particularly the human CGI. Although on the whole, it's a functional entertaining blockbuster.",The Great Wall

For its undeniable flaws (cheap CG, tonal issues, bad editing), Great Wall is never boring. With the kind of opulent stupidity that would make Roland Emmerich blush, it's full of gregarious art design, silly logic, and ill-fatedly heartfelt filmmaking that make it completely watchable. Far from the worst Damon movie this year (ahem...Suburbicon), this really deserves a 2nd chance to be a goofy cult classic.",The Great Wall

42,subxerogravity,Semi-Spectacular.,7,16 February 2017,"Not Bad at all.It moves very quickly, which surprised me. It does take away from how epic the movie subject matter feels, I mean the Great Wall of China is a wonder of the universe, and they did not do much to show that, choosing to give a look like they are just dealing with a small section of it, but I'm nick picking. This was a very well done action adventure fantasy type thing.Plus Matt Damon, once again proves that he's worth the price of admission. Very charming, very funny and unexpectedly dashing. I never put thought on how much I like or dislike Damon, but I'll say this, he's never let me down. Whenever I've seen a movie which he starred in I always come away feeling that I made the right decision in picking a movie to see that night.Damon plays a Spaniard that comes to the east for that black powder, son (AKA gun powder), when he is captured by a cult of warriors that live on the Great Wall protecting the other side from a species of strange beast trying to get over. .A well put together war movie, The Great Wall celebrates the art, with an interesting visual look on how these warriors protect the wall from these monsters (One cool scene shows how They uses a series of bows that whistle so that a warrior who can not see can still hear the enemy coming). It's very exciting to watch.And like I was saying, the monster they show here is quite impressive indeed. It may remind you of monsters you seen before on celluloid (Which makes sense as you don't want to go too out of what is already in nature), but the design was unique as well as the method of defeating it, which I don't think I've seen before.Visually, I am a little iffy on the film, altogether. Like a said before, The Great Wall sounds epic but the film itself has epic qualities but does not feel so. It feels oddly closed in for an IMAX film. The costumes are great, more specifically, ones worn by the female warriors in the movie. A nice shade of blue and design to pay homage to some bird. It's not surprising that I like them as they stand out from the rest of the film's gloomy and gritty look.Overall, The Great Wall is an action packed war movie with great battles against a bad ass foe.Round of applause to all who contributed to this film but a special shout out to Matt Damon. So far he's has never let me down.http://cinemagardens.com",The Great Wall

This Chinese production (also with some American, Australian and Canadian help) is not even close to what were those idiotic propaganda films. As I said in the review for ""Kong: Skull Island"", ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""The Great Wall"" they have something in common. And I do not mean only the actress Jing Tian, present in both and Legendary Entertainment, as one of the producing companies for both films.

44,jamesrupert2014,Silly but spectacular CGI-driven action-fluff,8,16 May 2019,"'The Great Wall' is one of these action films that feels as if it was written backwards, as though the writers started with an idea for the climax and then penned everything else in the film simply to set-up that scene. Briefly, mercenaries Garin (Matt Damon) and Tovar (Pedro Pascal) are trying to smuggle black-powder out of feudal/mythical China. Pursued by blood-thirsty nomads, they end up taking refuge at the titular wall, where Garin's (ridiculously) amazing fighting skills and the scaly souvenir of his run in with some kind of monster in the desert gains them the begrudging respect of the Chinese General (Zhang Hanyu) and his various underlings (including Commander Lin Mae (Jing Tian), a graceful killer in incredibly sexy armour). It seems that the Wall was built to protect China from a vast horde of 'demons' who appear out of the desert every 60 years, and (not surprisingly) the next demonic assault coincides with Garin and Tovar's arrival. This sets up an epic, heavily choreographed (and wildly implausible), battle sequence. The cinematography/CGI is great and, if the physics are wonky even by Wile E. Coyote standards, so what: its great fun to watch. After the usual anti-hero internal conflicts, a brief subplot involving a skeevy expat Sir Ballard (William Defoe), and the discovery that the demons are more cunning than originally thought, the heroes are off for a last stand in the Chinese capitol. Fortunately, the vast unstoppable horde of ravenous killer-demons-from-outer-space has a little hole in it (about the size of a womp-rat) through which just the right combination of martial skills, valor, convenient exobiology, and dubious physics might save the day. The story is pure heroic-hokum that's full of clichés, convenient coincidences, and blaring foreshadowing, but the CGI is lush and gorgeous, and the acting meets expectations for 2D characters in an over-the-top fantasy (although apparently the mental image of a heroic Matt Damon strutting along China's iconic wall (or CGI thereof) was enough to raise the 'cultural expropriation/white-saviour' banners). 'The Great Wall' is colourful, fast-moving fun that can't (or shouldn't) be taken seriously (either as a representation of Ming-dynasty China or as an example of celluloid Coca-colonialism).",The Great Wall

But in The Great Wall he is totally lifeless, sleepwalking through all of it, almost looking like he doesn't want to be in this film. Maybe it's not him, maybe it's how the character was written, very poorly I must say. Matt Damon has proved to have a better screen presence then what I saw here.But from I here Damon was added cause to get American audiences interested. But Damon is quite out of place here. The other characters don't really jump off the screen, not bland just don't grab your interest, Willem Dafoe is just okay in his supporting role. Has the movie goes on it starts to remind me of Reign of Fire(2002), almost a similar premise. Now the good things about this movie is the effects are pretty descent, and the very colorful armors and scenery, and not surprising coming from the director of Hero(2002), and House of Flying Daggers(2004), but other than that this movie is pretty bland.",The Great Wall
46,stevendbeard,Fantasy Theory,7,17 February 2017,"I saw ""The Great Wall"", starring Matt Damon-The Adjustment Bureau, Mystic Pizza; Pedro Pascal-Game of Thrones_tv, The Adjustment Bureau; Willem Dafoe-John Wick, John Carter and Tian Jing-The Man From Macau, Police Story:Lockdown. This is a Chinese/American movie-it is the most expensive Chinese film ever made-and in the opening scenes of the film, they say that there are lots of theories as to how and why the Great Wall of China came to be. They also say that this version is fantasy-as if any sane person might think that this story was true! They also say that it took 1700 years to build it and it is 5500 miles long. Anyway, Matt and Pedro are mercenaries traveling across Europe and heading for China to do some trading-or stealing, if necessary-for some Chinese gun powder. Matt & Pedro had more men when they started out but lost them to bandits and an encounter with a mysterious creature. When they get to the wall, they discover that the Chinese warriors are preparing for their annual attack by those same creatures that Matt & Pedro had encountered, earlier. I say annual because the creatures seem to attack about every 6 years or so-I guess it's when they get hungry. A Chinese soldier is played by Tian, who later gets promoted to general, after the former general is killed by one of the creatures. Willem plays another traveler that has been with the Chinese for years-he is now sort of like a prisoner because he had come looking for powder, too, and the Chinese did not take too kindly to him trying to steal from them. There are clues as to where the creatures come from. They started appearing after a big meteor hit, so I'm thinking they could either be aliens that were hitching a ride in the meteor or maybe they are some kind of subterranean creatures that were set free when the meteor hit the earth. Whichever way you want to believe, it is a fantasy movie and not a documentary so just enjoy it. It's rated ""PG"" for fantasy action violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The Great Wall

48,alindsay-al,An average blockbuster film that lacks depth,5,24 February 2017,"This is the most expensive film in Chinese history and it has some pretty big actors in it so I gave it a watch. The premise of the film sees a couple of mercenaries get kidnapped and taken to the great wall of China where they have to survive beasts attacking the wall. Matt Damon plays the main guy in this film and he does an okay job in the film, I liked his character arc in this film and I did find his character a little interesting. However,he tries an accent in this film it feels really forced and unnatural for him to sound like that. Pedro pascal from game of thrones is Damon's partner in this film and he is possibly the best part of this film. He is funny and charming and great in the action scenes that make you care about his character more then Damon. I liked the Japanese commander played by tian jang, I believe her name is, I thought she was pretty good in this film and fit her character well. However, Willem dafoe is in this film and he really serves no good purpose in this film. He pretty much plays a cartoon of himself in this film and he comes across looking stupid. The story of this film is just not particularly interesting and I didn't end up really caring about the situations or the characters really. The script has some pretty funny dialogue between Damon and pascal that did really build there friendship well. However, the more dramatic scenes come across as forced and bland. The style of this film is interesting, I loved the colourful designs of the battle armour of the army used in this film, the action scenes of this film really vary, I think the first big set battle is the best as of introduces you to the world and has some cool things in it. However, there is an overuse of slow mo used in this film that comes across as really lazy and boring to watch.

Whaaat? Every 60 years some monsters attack China and its people. Thankfully, they built...you know...a wall for protection. Two well-trailed white dudes gain the trust of the Chinese army and help them battle the ferocious monsters. The entire movie is medieval style battles with monsters, bow and arrows, spears, flaming catapults and the like. I wasn't really concerned for people's plight because Matt Damon isn't going to die so I switched off the brain and observed some unusual medieval vs monster battles.

50,jimbo-53-186511,Fantastic (possible minor spoilers),9,25 November 2017,"After watching The Great Wall I found myself both gobsmacked and flabbergasted; Gobsmacked at how great I thought that it was and flabbergasted that it only has an average IMDb rating of 6.0 out of 10. Incredible...Early in the film we're treating to a rather impressive battle royale complete with some of the most beautiful visuals and cinematography that I've witnessed in quite some time - the various colour sequences used by the army only enhance this effect and make the film go from looking gorgeous to impossibly gorgeous; the battle sequences are intense and director Yimou Zhang stages them well meaning that I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen for one second..OK so at this point I did have my doubts and wondered if the film would be all spectacle and style with no substance, but this really isn't the case. There is a story here which is well-explained and when there isn't any action the focus does shift to the army plotting how to overthrow the Tao Tei (this is headed up by Strategist Wang - played by Andy Lau who is a doppleganger for Jet Li - in fact for about the first 10-15 minutes that he was in the film I thought it was Jet Li). Anyway I digress.. The plotting and strategy to overthrow the Tao Tei is intelligent and involving - it's intelligent because more often than not a brain over braun approach needs to be adopted in order to defeat the Tao Tei which ensures that it is never just a dumb action film.There is one minor flaw with the film; Dafoe's character feels a little extraneous to the plot and his character in this film seems rather pointless; in fact why not just have Damon and Prince Oberyn trying to escape? In fact, Dafoe trying to escape after 25 years doesn't make much sense... wouldn't he have become institutionalised after all this time?Still, minor flaws aside, The Great Wall stands as one of the finest films I've seen in quite some time and it's rather average IMDb score of 6.0 out of 10 (at the time of writing this review) is rather puzzling.

I am very sure that Zhang Yimou, even though he made more money with this film than all of his other great films combined, is secretly ashamed of what he produced. So were Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe, who turn in the absolute worst performances of their careers. Of course, this could not be accomplished without the worst script in the history of Chinese cinema. I don't know who wrote it, but it could have been written better in one day by an amatuer college student. The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was better than this film; at least you could get a good laugh from it. Matt Damon looks embarrassed, as does Dafoe, but we cant see how embarrassed Zhang was. Shame on you. I have seen practically every Chinese film ever made; and this one is the worst. AskMrMovies.

That said, I'm not suggesting this is a mundane film. Its beautifully choreographed, colourful, imaginative and it has a very Chinese essence, that sets it part from its Western counterpart. The presence of a Western hero in the form of Matt Damon, whose pleasant, jokery, easy going persona, fits well into a variety of contexts, add's a little extra interest too.

55,peterp-450-298716,A bit ridiculous and enjoyable at the same time,6,15 June 2017,"""The last time I saw you, you left me for dead. The the time before that I saved your life! ""From time to time me as film buff yearns for a brainless fantasy movie. No need to pay attention because of ingeniously crafted intrigues and ingeniously interwoven stories. The nonsense level of ""The Great Wall"" is unbelievably high. And at some moments, the action scenes are so exaggerated that I'm sure even the Tao Tie rolled with their eyes. Everyone knows the Chinese Wall served a completely different function. The fact that it's being used as a defense against a completely different threat, makes the story more original. I bet they've sought inspiration in Chinese fables or saga.Asking Matt Damon to play the leading role, obviously would lead to critical reviews where words like ""commercial objective"" and ""pursuit of profit"" are used. Apparently the makers were sure of their case, because the budget for this movie was around $ 135 million. I bet they haven't spent much of it on the script writers. But looking at the impressive images with tight choreographed colorful Chinese armies fighting against hordes of green monsters, you know immediately which department absorbed the largest part of the budget. The props and costume department most probably costed a fortune. Not to mention the used CGI. When the first attack wave commenced, it felt as if I was watching the Chinese version of ""The Lord of the Rings"". It resembled the attack on Helms Deep a lot. Or was it something like that particular scene in ""World War Z"" with those zombies climbing up the walls of Jerusalem?This movie isn't about the construction of the Chinese Wall and isn't based on historical facts. It's about William Garin (Matt Damon) and Pero Tovar (Pedro Pascal) who, during their search for a revolutionary black powder, unintentionally get involved in a battle between Chinese forces and mythological creatures which are trying to conquer China already for many years (and after that the whole world). Initially, the two mercenaries are looked at as prisoners only by the Chinese commanders. However, when they get a demonstration of the fighting techniques William and Tovar master (many years of experience after fighting in different wars), the two shrewd fighters are being recruited and they join the battle against those bloodthirsty, lizard-like monsters.Casting a well-known Hollywood actor like Matt Damon, assures that a wider film audience is being reached. Another well-known face shows up after a while, namely Willem Dafoe. He's solely needed to explain why the Chinese commanders speak fluently English. In other words, a negligible role. The rest of the cast only consists of Chinese actors. And there are even a few playing an interesting role. Especially Hanyu Zhang and Andy Lau stood out. For me Tian Jing as commander Lin Mae was an enjoyment to watch. And not only because she's an extremely beautiful oriental femme fatale. Fortunately, they avoided to give it a romantic twist. No idyllic scenes with this beautiful Chinese fury and the brave hero.""The Great Wall"" focuses on the action and the immense combat scenes. When you consider this, the film is never boring. And the sometimes humorous dialogues between William and Tovar are also worth mentioning. When you look at the story-line, it all feels kind of ridiculous. And some scenes are utterly exaggerated. The moment Matt Damon slid down a chain, it wasn't only absurd to watch. The used special effects were extremely bad as well. But above all, the heroic end was grossly exaggerated. All in all, it was less bad than the renowned critics write. ""The Great Wall"" is still a pleasant treat. Some critic wrote that the Tao Tie lacked some realism. I wonder what kind of movie this guy expected to see. In my view, there is always a lack of realism when it comes to a fantasy story.

I understand that he's trying to break in to the action man role, but this is not the way for him to succeed. I have no idea what his accent was supposed to be and it jumps to the action so quickly that there's no back story or build up for any of the characters, despite later conversations about what they might have previously been up to. There was no chance to establish anything before the hoards attacked. I couldn't feel anything when anyone was wounded, etc, because I hadn't been able to get to know any of their names, let alone their characters even as the film progressed.Very rushed and crudely made.

So yeah, the first battle is pretty good but then the action in the film goes downhill. Not because of some mistake by the director or anything like that but because you can only watch so much CGI fighting on a screen before it all starts looking the same and you start getting bored. In summary; this would make a decent watch when it comes on TNT or USA in two years from now however this isn't a film you must watch right this second because it is awesome or whatever.

And...a totally miscast Matt Damon saves everyone with his dexterous skills as a mercenary and skilled archer.

There is much pomp and circumstances that are downright laughable. Still, one just can't look away from all the glitz and the poor taste on display.

The direction by Zhang Yimou, though strong on the visual, is extremely weak on building any suspense, characters, or logic.This international production wastes the talents of those on the screen (the aforementioned Mr. Damon, Pedro Pascal, Jing Tian, and Willem DeFoe) and all of the many artisans involved behind the camera.The Great Wall is a lot of nonsense.

61,rgkarim,Aims for the Eyes,7,16 February 2017,"The Great Wall, one of the famous wonders of the world and a prime example of architecture to test time. Chances are though you have not heard of the legend behind its crafting and the real terror held back by its strong stone. Tonight, I got to see that legend come to life in a movie entitled The Great Wall. Led by Matt Damon, this movie promised to be an interesting spectacle whose quality was up in the air. What are the results? As always read on to find out. LIKES:  Creature design  Culture references captured on screen  Impressive visuals  Semi-exciting battlesSUMMARY: When the first trailer opened up, I wondered what the mysterious beasts that lurked in the great beyond looked like. While latter trailers portrayed them as mere lizard dogs, the Great Walls Tao Tei were a nice spin to modern paranormal monster. Both deadly and bizarre, the monsters had clever integration of biology meeting magic, to craft a worthy rival capable of testing the might of China's army. These beasts fit very well with the theme of the movie, taking extraterrestrial and mixing it with influences from the Chinese culture. Speaking of culture, the movie does a nice job designing artificial sets and costumes mirroring many of China's strong traditions. The armor, while a little fake looking, was a blend of beauty and lethality with colors and symbols being organized into various roles in the defense. The landscape mirrors the pictures in National Geographic, vivid and bright that contrast the strong, stoic grey of the wall. And while the visual specs are certainly stunning (probably better in 3-D), the values of honor, friendships, and trust are hammered deep in the dialogue/cinematography of this movie, primarily through the two lead characters. When not portraying the culture though, the impressive visuals are primarily for crafting the ""exciting"" battles that Great Wall promised. This film pays great homage to the art of CGI, with many elements mirroring the effects seen in the Lord of the Rings films (Helms deep anyone). Realistic extras seemingly blend into the massive chaos that are the fights, mixing with their relatively realistic behemoths they are trying to hold. Outside of the visuals, the battles have some exciting moments, taking the defensive concept and adding clever toys our soldiers use. The first battle in particular gets the gold for quality as it is fast, dynamic, and the most detailed of the five soirees of death. If only the fights could have continued this momentum, perhaps the movie would have been even more exciting. DISLIKES:  Matt Damon's acting at times  The rushed story/editing  Characters lacking development  The battles drop after the first oneSUMMARY: Certainly the first dislike is not the best dislike to have, but hear me out. Damon is known for some stellar performances, but this direction didn't work for me. He was supposed to play a rather skilled night, and while his choreographed battle moves hit the mark, his cool guy dialogue failed. Damon's delivery was an awkward, stiff attempt to be funny, which only had me giggling at how out of place it was. Others struggled to make up for it, but Damon could have brought some more Bourne elements to his rogue nature. As I said though this is the minor dislikeWhile others seemed to enjoy the story, I felt it needed some tinkering to make their tale as strong as the wall. Much of the story was hastily developed, answers coming in a plethora of ""Ah-Hah"" moments as they conveniently stumbled on miracle pieces of information. Moments that were supposed to hit the heart hard or add some build-up to the spectacle were edited to blunt sequences where things were solved too quickly. Even worse was most of the character development. Many of the lieutenants, squires, and even the Tao Tei had so much potential for deep, edgy tales that helped us relate to either hero/beast and get us hooked into the moment. Nope, again like the story, many of the characters are stacked like wobbly Jenga blocks only to be knocked down with little more than a few Chinese words. This is sad, as deeper characters and plot could have taken this movie out of the hoakie realm and put it closer to the winner's circle. However, the biggest let down for me were the action scenes. As mentioned the first battle (seen mostly in the trailers) had the break out of the gates excitement you wanted to see. After that battle though, many of the fights quickly grew monotonous, the hasty editing doing little than show gruesome deaths, overdramatic lunges with weapons, very short bouts of destruction. I had hoped that each battle would lead to a grand finale where army and hive drones clashed, glorifying our generals with strategic warfare that pushed both to their very limits. Yet, once again Hollywood Studios decided to give mediocre, simplistic, drawn out sequences that once more tied up rather conveniently. SighThe VERDICT: Great Wall certainly is a spectacle to the ""eyes"" as Damon leads the charge in impressive visuals and decent military bouts. Friends who liked the Chinese mythology, will certainly enjoy this comic book like tale and all the ""excitement"" it brings. Yet, despite all the good, Great Wall really lacks in the complete story department and character building, leaving the predictable plot a little dry, lacking, and dare I say rushed. Perhaps this would have been offset, had Universal Studios put their money into bolder fights and more dynamic moments. Worth a trip to the theater? For visuals, yes (including 3-D), but for everything else I recommend saving your money for something else you fancy. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",The Great Wall

63,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,A weird historical fantasy/ horror.,5,8 March 2017,"This overly ambitious historical fantasy/ horror has some inspired visuals and camera-work, solid enough cast, in its tale of two thieves on the run during the Song Dynasty (960 – 1279) who end up fighting with a small army, against demon creatures trying to storm the title object, as they try to reach the capital city of Bianjing, to the north, but it never quite gels together for me. Some comedic elements were amusing, but simultaneously seemed out of place. The climactic battle involved literally everything from combusting hot air balloons to bombs being fired on arrows from a stained glass building into the capital city to try to kill the queen of these creatures. The building itself looks exquisite, with its multicoloured hues shooting down like daggers, yet it also seemed vaguely out of place, like it had wandered out of a Dario Argento film.The innumerable demon creatures themselves, looked like a cross between James Cameron's fanged Alien, and the two demon dogs from the end of Ghostbusters. They did have a creepy look to them, but their derivative nature was distracting.Also distracting was Tian Jing's ridiculous beauty, oddly out of place as well. There were things about this movie that I liked, but I can't decide if those individual elements gelled together enough for me to recommend this one.",The Great Wall
64,bkrauser-81-311064,Visually and Sutextually Interesting,7,20 February 2017,"Well the writing is clearly on the wall with this one. Proudly declared in this enthralling and sumptuous siege movie is a pretty fundamental economic message. A message which up until now, has only been hinted at in films as variant as Transformers: Age of the Markie Mark (2014) and xXx: The Return of Xtra Cash (2017). It's been an entire generation since we started seeing ""Made in China"" carved into a large swath of our clothing, electronics and other such products. Now it seems we're starting to send them something back in earnest. If you happen to be confused about what that something is, it's okay it's not for you anyway. Heck it's not even about you anymore.The Great Wall stars Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal as craven European mercenaries seeking the fabled black powder which rumor has it, ""can ignite the air."" When we first meet our small band of mercenaries, their numbers have dwindled due to fatigue, disease and the engagement of small barbarian war parties. Close to making a final stand against oncoming hordes, the Europeans stumble onto a deadly siege 60 years in the making; pitting Song Dynasty armies and the able Commander Lin (Jing) against a hungry swarm of alien creatures.The main question asked in the front of the film is whether Damon's William character will use his mad archery skills to serve a worthy cause larger than himself, or continue on the path of shallow, personal enrichment and greed. ""You and I are very different,"" the Commander says in a moment of defensive parlay. Both she and William are soldiers, born and bred, but Lin it seems has a moral compass that somehow makes her irreproachable. To further hammer the point home, the aliens bleed green, are faked out by a literal compass and ravenously consume everything in their path at the behest of an ugly looking queen.Damon is for the sake of drinking everything in (and box office draw), our ostensible lead. We see nearly everything from his point of view and his character growth is clearly the most obvious. Yet the tale of William and his cynical partner Tovar (Pascal) is one that at times feels ancillary to the intrigue along the 5,500 mile wall. They're basically the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of China; they make snarky remarks, are treated as honored guests, are oblivious to the tragedy around them and don't really do anything of consequence. Coupled with the duo always sporting drab colors and you got yourself a couple of leads that all but fade into the background while minor characters just seem to pop out.Of course if anyone was going to bring an interesting color palette into this, it'd be director Yimou Zhang. Once again the veteran director of Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) is bring his resplendent A-game, injecting his sets with multihued designs, costuming and concepts. In the film's big climax, Lin and William scale a stain glass spire that has beams of light coming in seemingly from all sides. There's no reason for this of course, but there's no denying how absolutely breathtaking it looks.By-in-large, the visuals are what saves The Great Wall from being a total waste of time. That and internalizing the lessons learned from a movie that casts a much wider net as far as audiences are concerned, while fishing in shallower waters when it comes to content. The Great Wall is not a smart movie, nor is it a particularly unique one. But if you're willing to accept Damon dawning China-red armor and being part of a cheerleading squad for Beijing then I say 祝你好运.",The Great Wall
65,nancyldraper,An odd combination,7,5 September 2020,"This is an odd movie. It's beautifully made. The colours and costuming are gorgeous. The scale is large like old Hollywood, but the quips are all contemporary. And, yet, it doesn't quit live up to its scale. I enjoyed it, though. I give this film a hesitant 7(good) out of 10. {Legend?}",The Great Wall
66,valadas,Not a great film,6,21 February 2017,Although technically it is almost a masterpiece. The battle scenes are powerful and frightful with amazing scenes and sceneries and amazing special effects. It deals with huge masses of extra people and walkers-on who perform and behave orderly and impressively. The Great China Wall is in the story a mere pretext though it allows to show images of great impression. The story is very simple in itself and conveys a legend of the mass attacks to the Wall by a tribe of monsters that want to invade China. The two main characters are European mercenaries trying to smuggle black powder from China to Europe. One of them however ends up by getting involved in the fight against the monsters on the side of the troops commanded by a beautiful woman general. The European characters and the Chinese lady general sometimes use a language and an accent when speaking that is more 21st century than mediaeval. Not a specially good film but one that affords two hours of heed to the viewer.,The Great Wall
67,MR_Heraclius,The Great Wall,7,13 February 2020,"Matt Damon, given his predicament and the backlash of being a white person cast in a move that was based in China, still gave a great performance. The plot was nothing special, but I throughly enjoyed the concept. The cinematography was beautifully shot and the colors throughout the movie make it very pleasing to the eyes. Without the camera work, this would not be a good movie. I think this movie is still worth a watch.",The Great Wall
68,Screen_Blitz,"As a popcorn action flick, it's passable. But The Great Wall is not as compelling or versatile as it intends to be",5,31 May 2017,"This fantasy-action flick sees Hollywood taking on a rare, but familiar challenge: collaborating with the Chinese motion picture industry. Breaking the record of the biggest budgeted cinematic entity filmed on Chinese soil, this movie sees international director Yimou Zhang (most famous for martial arts films such as 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers') making his American film debut in what appears to be an odd blend between a historical epic and a Medieval-themed fantasy flick. And the main figure of concern in this picture takes place on one of the world's most famous landmarks, The Great Wall of China. As a popcorn action spectacle, this film has its moments. But for a movie uprooted by such a massive nine-digit budget, much of its potential feels gravely wasted on such a shallow execution of an already lackluster concept. That is not to say that film doesn't infuse a few moments of excitement. Set during the Song Dynasty, the film follows William Garin (played by Matt Damon) and Pero Tovar (played by Pedro Pascal), a duo of European mercenaries of set to China in search of gunpowder, only to find themselves caught in a century-long war between the Chinese army and an enormous horde of monstrous lizard- like creatures. Armed with mass weaponry mounted on the Great Wall of China, William and Pero join forces with Commander Lin (played by Jing Tian), General Shao (played by Zhang Hanyu), and the rest of the troops to become the line of defense against the massive monster onslaught. Aside from the controversy surrounding the lead roles operated by Caucasian American actors, this film suffers from a number of problems that bar it from succeeding as a compelling big-budget action extravaganza it sets out to be. Although the concept surrounding an old mythical conflict between the Chinese order and weird alien creatures complete with overly obvious CGI is dumb enough, it is definitely not impossible for Yimou Zhang to makes thing work. For a fair portion of the film such as the final action sequence taking place in the tower above the large sea of monstrous creatures, there is some fun and excitement to be handed here. The battles involving the Chinese army fending against hordes of monsters in a series of explosions and bloodletting are little fun. But for a majority of the story, it seems that Yimou Zhang has trouble keeping things interesting, particularly when connecting the action set pieces with mundane character-driven moments. The plot kicks in with the two European leads captured and coming face-to- face with the Chinese Order who view the two as dirty human entities and decide they must help these men learn to become clean and honorable figures, and that is best of character development we are treated with. While Yimou Zhang makes the bright choice of avoiding turning the characters into frail stereotypes, none of the characters including Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal are particularly interesting. Even William Dafoe who has a small role as some European servant for the Chinese is greatly squandered here. The Chinese actors are sadly not given much to do here either incluing Zhang Hanya who is best characterization is yelling orders and splashing the crowd with numerous battle speeches As for the performances, each of the cast gets the job done including Matt Damon, that if you can get past the inconsistencies of his Irish accent.The Great Wall is an underwhelming fantasy action adventure that may offer a few adrenaline-fueled thrills along the line, but fails the meet the level of excitement and narrative compulsion it sets out to be. This film is in no means a disaster to say the least, after all it has more than the potential to appeal to action junkies looking for a loud, if somewhat cheesy adventure to root for. At the same time, it is almost thoroughly forgettable even with names like Matt Damon on the marque.",The Great Wall
69,Troy_Campbell,A blemish on Yimou's (and Damon's) career.,2,17 February 2017,"Zhang Yimou is one of the finest Chinese directors working today; Hero and House of Flying Daggers are two of the most gorgeous and engrossing martial arts movies of this millennium. So it defies belief that he is also responsible for this absolute turkey. Centred around the protection of China from a horde of flesh-hungry monsters, who are thankfully limited to attacking the Great Wall of China in one spot only, the screenplay is full of laughable plot holes, shonky dialogue and predictable story beats. Like almost every alien invasion flick that has come before it, the protagonists are provided the remarkably convenient opportunity to end it all if they can just get to that pesky Alien Queen! But never fear, as Matt Damon's warrior is here. Complete with woeful accent and silly ponytail, Damon dishes up a career-low effort as the mercenary-turned-saviour William, his flirtatious relationship with feisty Commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing) is embarrassingly stodgy whilst the witty banter with his rascally mate Tovar (Pedro Pascal – the standout) is hit and miss. Thankfully, with Yimou calling the shots, there is a plethora of stunningly choreographed action sequences no, wait, there isn't. The crime to end all crimes is the complete dearth of inventive and beautifully shot set pieces; instead of Yimou's trademark elegance and wondrous composure, there's limp action full of horrendous CGI, messy editing and confusing staging. The production and costume design is aesthetically pleasing—the colour coded army factions is a neat idea—but even this is lost amidst a flurry of atrocious visual effects and murky cinematography. Incredibly muddled, staggeringly boring and chock full of Z-grade awfulness, The Great Wall will forever be a blemish on the careers of all involved.",The Great Wall
70,pyrocitor,Mattlan,5,1 March 2017,"""Thank you, Matt Damon, for teaching us to use chopsticks."" ""Thank you, Matt Damon, for bringing honour to us all."" The Twitter backlash against The Great Wall and its white saviour lead has demonstrated as much ferocity (and much more sass) than any of the battle sequences in the film itself. Ultimately, they needn't have bothered. Here, Matt Damon is cast as expensive prop, mostly there to marvel at the glories of a Chinese military pumped up by Cirque du Soleil, or learn the value of nationalist collectivism in between bits of showcasing his best (/most embarrassing) Legolas impression. Ultimately, he may as well have been replaced by his Team America: World Police puppet self. It wouldn't have made the film much goofier, and he has about as much dialogue anyway.Yes, The Great Wall is just as bonkers, braindead, and stupendously fun as you'd ever dare to expect. Here, the amassed might of revered Hero/House of Flying Daggers director Zhang Yimou's balletic wuxia pian spectacle-combat with the production values only a Chinese/Hollywood co-production can muster is pitted against a horde of CGI blob alien hyena-lizards. It's a two hour, sillier, substantially less emotionally engaging version of the battle of Helm's Deep from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. And that's about it. Terse glances are exchanged, battle cries are bellowed, motion is slowed, (feeble) computer imagery is generated, every foreseeable object and most characters are airborne at various points, and everyone learns a valuable lesson in friendship. Yes, really. Still, it's no stupider than the majority of Hollywood's annual throwaway, pre-summer-box-office-lull action dross, and is oodles more fun in its transparent ludicrousness. Sure, the pro-China propaganda is a bit more on the nose than even Hollywood audiences might be used to, and the screenwriters (all American, natch) still sputter up a script so ungainly it reads like it's been run back and forth through google translate. No sh*ts are given about the deluge of historical anachronisms (did you know the Great Wall has a trap door?), or a 'kill the queen, the armies die' finale so lazy it makes The Avengers and The Phantom Menace's comparable cop-outs feel like Shyamalan plot twists. A cross-cultural romance is flirted with, but never consummated (but let's face it: for a film this buffoonish, ""we are not so different"" is basically sex). Even better: in a fit of remarkable pandering, the script mediates the respective language barriers by having an awkward number of lines repetitively translated back and forth between English and Mandarin by interpreters. These are usually factually narrating things are already happening, thereby making the translations doubly redundant (is that even a thing? Don't you dare say 'Redundanception'!). But, for those savvy enough to be here for the rich ironic humour, these touches only add to the film's whooping, spectacularly ridiculous charm. Yimou, to his credit, is thoroughly committed to his (presumed) artistic experiment of seeing how beautiful a film so dumb can be, nearly sagging the screen with slow-motion, flamboyantly 3D CGI arrows, explosions, and a flying shield that teasingly riffs on Captain America (subtext achieved). Here, the titular battlement is lined by model/soldiers in florescent coloured armour, making them look like a cross between Power Rangers and hummingbirds, who attach ropes and harnesses to themselves, leap from the wall, skewer their enemies with spears, only to bounce back up to the wall like bungee jumpers. This proves as perfect a microcosmic metaphor for the film as any: it's outlandishly implausible, ignores all known laws of physics, and, frankly, is grossly inefficient. But hot damn it looks cool. Mulan-sorry-Matt Damon's goofy archery tricks? Them too. A bit where Yimou hopes we forget how hot air balloons work? Yep, still awesome. That finale, where the hordes of CGI-alien-hyena-lizards swarm a a tower of stained glass, resulting in a rainbow disco party of shimmering colour as Damon hops up the crumbling pieces of stone like Super Mario - or even better: like 'sucks-to-your-gravity' Legolas during the climax of Peter Jackson's execrable The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies? At this point, stupidly awesome and awesomely stupid are becoming worrisomely interchangeable, but I'll take it. Now: let's talk about Damon's accent. The only feasible theory can be that he sensed some elements in his film were more ridiculous than him, and he decided to up the ante. Like a verbal blender tossing in all the scraps from the fridge on leftover day, he haphazardly coughs up syllables of Irish, Bostonian, Australian, and a kind of Muppets-calibre Russian, while, amazingly(!) still achieving as little inflection or emotion possible in each line. If you thought the wall was great, just wait for Mattcent, proudly crowning all future 'worst movie accents' lists until the end of time. Thankfully, Chinese star Tian Jing is far more committed to taking her film seriously. As formidably badass as she is immaculately made up, Jing, while not the most credibly emotive, proves a genuinely satisfying action lead, and it's a real shame she's not the picture's star, as she's infinitely more interesting than Damon. Rounding out the international quota, the charismatically grumpy Pedro Pascal makes for surprisingly entertaining (intentional) comic relief, while Andy Lau brings genuine gravitas to his earnest strategist. And Willem Dafoe, skulking uncomfortably to the point where you wonder if Yimou genuinely forgot he was cast? Well, he's in it too. For all of The Great Wall's pomp and circumstance as the first of an announced slew of Chinese/Hollywood co-productions, it sets the bar almost brazenly low. Visual razzle-dazzle and dopey fun aside, Yimou's budget-bloated B-movie recalls a rat that has gorged itself into oblivion, blissfully basking in its own obscene opulence. Next up: a sequel, starring Jing (and an actual script). She'll make a man out of you. -5/10",The Great Wall

75,Richie-67-485852,A Greater Wall Needed,7,19 November 2017,"I liked this movie. It was something new for the monster genre and who could dispute the facts of the story if it happened centuries ago? I was thankful that the scenes moved steadily because when they didn't you lose interest right away. I also like the fact that the monsters attack in broad daylight but that was taking a risk. Why? You lose the fear factor that comes with not being able to see for sure. If there was more care given to the story line, perhaps some time spent in the enemy camp like where is it, what do they do and how they live plus more history on what happened centuries prior this could have been a nice contender similar to the Pitch Black monsters in the Riddick flick. I was curious why they didn't have sub-titles for the Chinese speaking parts. I had to guess at what was happening. For the amount of money spent here, they could have made this into a 2 hour movie that could have had sequel potential for the monsters. The stars in this movie look like they went along for a paycheck more than their resume building. Interesting as when I was watching, I knew this would do well in China etc. but what about us? Never the less, I was captured for the hour and forty five minutes so I have no gripe. This is not a see it again movie by the way. One time and your done here and I mean for decades!

77,rockman182,The Great Wall (2017),6,16 April 2017,"I'm a big fan of the wonders of the world, whether it be natural or man made. When I first heard of this film I thought it would be a historical film about the history of the building of the wall. Its not quite about that and has some very fantastical elements to it, which I can deal with. The film faced a white washing controversy (as many modern Hollywood films do) but I'm here to review the film based on what it offers and not controversial circumstances surrounding the casting.These types of big budget action films show up often, and unless they are something related to a comic book or a pre-existing franchise, they can very often turn out to be bad. I'm sort of happy to say that while this film is incredibly stupid at some points, it wasn't a waste of time and offered cheap thrills and easy entertainment. The mythology of the origins of the creatures is a little muddled and certain plot elements about what makes the monsters weak seems conveniently hashed together to fit into 90 minutes. The action scenes for the most part are quite well made, no matter how absolutely ridiculously mind-numbing the sequences can be.Generally, the wall and the cinematography of imperial China looked good. I like grand scale cinematography that encompass vast and gigantic landscapes. Unfortunately, the CGI for the Taotie (the monstrous creatures of the film) is distractedly bad and this happens often. The creatures never look real and it takes you aback from the world of the film and into criticizing the effects. There's plenty of action in the film which I think will please people looking for fun. Its however not always interesting when the film goes into developing the side quest of attaining and stealing the black powder.The film has a good cast but the cast seems a bit wasted in this film. I became a fan of Pedro Pascal as Oberyn Martell on Game of Thrones but he just kind of fades into the background in this film. Even Matt Damon becomes the victim of fading into obscurity in it. The characterization in the film is just plain bland at certain points, but I'm not complaining too much.

80,RforFilm,A man is looking to stop monsters from coming over a great wall...and then there's The Great Wall,4,22 February 2017,"A lot of the high box office numbers that were seeing in our summer blockbusters often has to do with China. The country's high population, along with a rising film industry and a certain amount of American movies that are approved to be screened, have contributed to larger returns. Not only has it let some of last years films like Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory, and Zootopia to cross the one billion mark, but even movies that under-performed in the U.S. like Terminator: Genisys, Transformers: Age of Extinction, and Warcraft to exceed enough to make up for a lackluster performance.It would make sense that more films from China would receive a release in the States. So for today's movie, what we have is a co-production between several companies from China and the U.S. There's been a lot of controversy over the casting of it's main actor Matt Damon. It's common for these kinds of stories to make headlines in an age where tolerance is demanded. It's only justified if the film is looked at fairly. Now that the movie has been released I can say that the claims of Damon being a ""white savior"" are unwarranted. The Great Wall actually has something different in store. Sometime during the Song dynasty (around 970 to 1279 A.D.) in China, a group of mercenaries have been traveling for months in order to acquire the legendary ""black power"" that could change everything in Europe. During one evening where they're resting, an mysterious monster attacks, leaving only William (played by Matt Damon) and Tovar (played by Pedro Pascal) left on the journey. Bandits chase after them the next day where they run into the Great Wall of China. To escape the bandits, the two guys let the Chinese army arrest them. The specific army that took them in, the Nameless Order, was created by the emperor for the specific purpose of stopping these dragon-iguana creatures from making it into the country. From what were told by Commander Lin (played by Jing Tian), the monsters are intelligent and continue to keep trying. William manages to impress her with his archery skills and the fact that he fought off the same creature the other night. William also meets another European Sir Ballard (played by William Dafoe) who also came to Chine in search of the black powder. When it's discovered that the creatures have been secretly digging a long hole that reaches the Forbidden City, the battle is on.I have to give The Great Wall a lot of credit for wanting to give us a big fantasy epic that's a good set up and is beautify photographed. But the casting of Matt Damon only proves that even a good actor like him can't save a project with boring characters. I'm not sure what the intention was, but the character is dull and boring. Other then his archery skills, I don't remember a single line from him. What's worse is that the rest of the cast has little to do with their characters other then fighter and make an occasional battle speech.The CGI on the creatures has mixed results with some looking clear but other scenes look obviously fake. I guess this has a similar problem that Warcraft had, which is having some good battle scenes but being stuck with people who are too bland to get invested in. The Great Wall does get a step up though for having a simpler story to follow that I was able to pick up quickly. So why couldn't the three writers (including World War Z author Max Brooks) have made more interesting characters?I'll give this four Great Walls out of ten. I can only say that action fans will probably get their fill if their willing to follow bland people. The movie did look good on a big screen and will probably do so on anyone's LCD TV. I hope that a better Chinese/American co-produced movie can come about, as something got lost in translation with The Great Wall.",The Great Wall
81,petra_ste,Green Trouble in Little China,6,14 June 2017,"Zhang Yimou's Hero has the dubious privilege of being the most gorgeous movie with a reprehensible message I've ever watched in theaters (""Hey, if the tyrant prevails at least the war will end and we'll all be cool, amirite? Also, check out this awesome fight scene with a red-and-yellow colour palette!"").Yimou seemed to make an amend of sorts with Curse of the Golden Flower, which was less visually luscious but had the good grace to squint with horror at the brutality of absolute power celebrated by the ending of Hero.In The Great Wall, a Chinese-American fantasy epic, politics take a backseat (other than a generic ""sacrifice for the greater good"" theme) and the director goes for pure schlock - call it Yimou's Pacific Rim.See, what history books fail to mention is how the titular Wall was built to protect ancient China against hordes of green telepathic alien hyenas. That's kind of a grievous omission, history books. Cue a noble order defending the Wall, including strategist Andy Lau and commander Tian Jing, who knows how to rock a tight-fitting armor.Cue Matt Damon - who can be fine in the right part (The Talented Mr Ripley) but is on auto-pilot here - and Oberyn Martell, unshaven Western mercenaries gaping at the unusual sight before jumping into the fray.Cue Willem Dafoe as an older prisoner, a role tailor-made for the purpose of delivering exposition... except he doesn't even get to deliver exposition. Oh, there is a subplot about gunpowder, but it doesn't go anywhere and Oberyn Martell could have carried it alone. I guess Willem Dafoe is there to justify why members of the order can speak English fluently in ancient China: Willem Dafoe taught them. I appreciate your sudden concern for realism, movie, but - given the green telepathic alien hyenas - you shouldn't have bothered.All the outcry for white guy Matt Damon starring in a story about the Great Wall could have been saved for the movie being, you know, not very good. The first act is enjoyable in a mindless kind of way with the spectacle of various units wearing specific hues of brightly colored armors depending on their battle specialization... although the blue ones who bungee jump on monsters really drew the short stick.Sadly, the movie peters out in a last act which is unintentionally funny (""Oh no, the monsters did pass through the Wall while we weren't watching! All five millions of them!""), obvious and anticlimactic: the Good Guys only need to blow up the Alien Queen, which provides wi-fi connection to the whole horde. Kind of like the last act of Edge of Tomorrow (the worst part of it).Pity: with the same endearingly ludicrous high-concept premise but stronger characters and a tighter script (and more sense of humour, because you really can't play this stuff with a straight face), The Great Wall could have become something of a cult classic. (Also, this is a cheap shot... but the movie poster, with its ominous ""What were they trying to keep out?"" tagline under the actor's giant mug, looks like the Great Wall was built to defend China against Matt Damon. Mission failed, Wall). 5,5/10",The Great Wall
82,Anurag-Shetty,A visual delight.,8,5 February 2017,"The Great Wall tells the story of a group of Western mercenaries, searching for a powerful substance known as black powder, in China. Soon, they get involved in protecting the Great Wall of China against an army of monsters, known as the Taotie. The Great Wall is an awesome film. The highlight of the movie is its visual effects. The 3D has been put to great use, throughout the film. Every scene in the movie is eye-popping in 3D, especially the action set pieces. In recent times, this is the only film that takes full advantage of 3D. Director Zhang Yimou excels in his English feature directorial debut. The only flaw in the movie, is that its plot is simple & predictable. Matt Damon is superb as William Garin. Tian Jing is amazing as Commander Lin Mei. Pedro Pascal is brilliant as Pero Tovar. Willem Dafoe is impressive as Ballard. Andy Lau is good as Strategist Wang. Eddie Peng is effective as General Wu. Lu Han is spectacular as Peng Yong. The Great Wall is worth a watch for monster movie buffs.",The Great Wall
83,swilliky,A moderately entertaining fantasy action film from China,4,24 February 2017,"Cultures collide as a big budget film from China caters to American audiences as well. Matt Damon stars as the soldier, adventurer, and mercenary trader William who seeks the mysterious black powder of the Chinese. He partners with Tovar (Pedro Pascal) to elude the dangerous warriors but both are captured by the powerful army that mans the Great Wall. The army, led by General Shao (Hanyu Zhang), prepares for battle against monstrous beings reportedly from another planet. The beings looked pretty cool and the battle sequences were awe-inspiring but the plot is a little clumsy and rushed and the acting and dialogue leave something to be desired. The magnificence of the Great Wall was captured in a few shots but most of the action scenes are confined to small areas and it never felt like the beasts attacked from more than one place, a single valley. Still seeing Commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing) jump from the wall with her fellow blue female soldiers to spear the creatures was a sight to behold on the big screen. Rounding out the plot is a captured trader from the West, Ballard (Willem Dafoe) also interested in the gunpowder and ways to steal it, though he had given up on ever leaving this battle.

You can tell a lot of work and care went into the production and CGI alone. I'd say it was beyond impressive. Technically, the colors, saturation, scenery, set design, and costume design were all to die for. To me it's a must see movie based on those merits alone. It probably helped that I saw this on a 55"" HDR 4K TV. Made it all the more worthwhile, though.",The Great Wall
85,bob-the-movie-man,Exercising Your Damons,5,18 March 2017,"Millions of people watching the 2017 Oscars would have seen Jimmy Kimmel roasting poor Matt Damon as a part of their long running 'feud'. At one point he points out that Matt gave up the leading role in ""Manchester by the Sea"" to star in a ""Chinese ponytail movie"" that ""went on to lose $80 million at the box office"". ""The Great Wall"" is that movie! So is it really that bad?Well, it's no ""Manchester by the Sea"" for sure. But I don't think it's quite the total turkey that critics have been labelling it as either. I went to see it on a Sunday afternoon, and approaching it as a matinée bit of frothy action is a good mental state to be in.Matt Damon plays the ponytailed-wonder William, a European mercenary travelling in 11th Century China with his colleague Tovar (Pedro Pascal) in an attempt to determine the secrets of black powder – a secret well-guarded by the Chinese. Captured by the 'New Order' at the Great Wall and imprisoned there by General Shao (Hanyu Zhang), William earns the respect of Shao and his beautiful warrior second- in- command Lin Mae (Tian Jing) with his bowmanship. This is almost immediately put to use by the arrival (after 60 year's absence – a funny thing, timing, isn't it?) of hoards of vicious creatures called Taoties. (I thought they said Tauntauns initially, so was expecting some sort of Chinese/Star Wars crossover! But no.)Taoties who scale the wall are defeated by William who poleaxes them. (This is an attempt at brilliant humour to anyone who has already seen the film – poleaxe. get it? POLEaxe. Oh, never mind!) Despite being a mercenary at heart, William is torn between staying and helping Lin Mae fight the beasts and fleeing with Tovar, their new chum Ballard (Willem Dafoe) and their black powder loot. (I'm sure something about Lin Mae's tight-fitting blue armour was influential in his decision). This is an historic film in that although in recent years there has been cross-fertilization of Chinese actors into Western films for box-office reasons (for example, in the appalling ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" and the much better Damon vehicle ""The Martian"") this was the first truly co-produced Chinese/Hollywood feature filmed entirely in China. It might also be the last given the film's $150 million budget and the dismal box-office! To start with some positives, you can rely on a Chinese-set film (the film location was Qingdao) to allow the use of an army of extras and – although a whole bunch of CGI was also no doubt used – some of the battles scenes are impressive. There is a stirring choral theme by Ramin Djawadi (best known for his TV themes for ""Game of Thrones"" and the brilliant ""Westworld"") played over silk-screen painted end titles that just make for a beautiful combination. And Tian Jing as the heroine Lin Mae is not only stunningly good-looking but also injects some much needed acting talent into the cast, where most of those involved (including Damon himself) look like they would rather be somewhere else. And some of the action scenes are rather fun in a 'park your brain by the door' sort of way, including (nonsensically) cute warrior girls high-diving off the wall on bungey ropes to near certain death. While the CGI monsters are of the (yawn) over-the-top LoTR variety, their ability to swarm like locusts at the Queen's command is also quite entertainingly rendered.Where the movie balloon comes crashing down to earth in flames though is with the story and the screenplay – all done by three different people each, which is NEVER a good sign.The story (by Max Brooks (""World War Z""), Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (both on ""The Last Samurai"") is plain nonsensical at times. No spoilers here, but the transition from ""wall under siege"" to ""wall not under siege"" gives the word 'clunky' a bad name. As another absurdity, the ""New Order"" seem amazed how William was able to slay one of the creatures (thanks to the poleaxing 'McGuffin' previously referenced) but then throughout the rest of the film he slays creatures left right and centre (McGuffin-less) through just the use of a spear or an arrow! Bonkers.Things get worse when you add words to the actions. The screenplay by Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro (both ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"") and Tony Gilroy (Tony Gilroy? Surely not he of all the ""Bourne"" films and ""Rogue One"" fame? The very same!) has a reading age of about an 8 year old. It feels like it has been translated into Chinese and then back again to English with Google Translate. ""Is that the best you can do?"" asks Tovar to William at one point. I was thinking exactly the same thing.The combination of the cinematography and the special effects have the unfortunate effect of giving the film the veneer of a video game, but this is one where your kid-brother has stolen the controls and refuses to give them back to you.Having had the great thrill of visiting a section of The Great Wall near Beijing, I can confirm that it is an astonishing engineering masterpiece that has to be seen to be truly believed. It ranks as one of the genuine wonders of the world. The same can not be said of this movie. Early teens might enjoy it as a mindless action flick. But otherwise best avoided until it emerges on a raining Sunday afternoon on the TV.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",The Great Wall

The plot is rubbish, the dialogue is garbage, the acting is wooden, and I didn't really care for any characters in this film, that's just to start with! It was like watching a computer game made from a weird Chinese fable. I imagine this is what Cirque Du Soleil does when not performing on stage.I appreciate that the producers needed a big name on the poster to draw an audience but why on earth did 'Jason Bourne' agree to make this garbage. Pedro Pascal's character is reasonably fun, which is why I gave 1 star (though I couldn't give less).With a few tweaks, this could have been a comedy spoof and it would have been so much better if they had done that instead of trying to make a serious film!

88,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,6 August 2017,"For the first half-hour, more or less, I kept thinking ""how is it possible for a movie this entertaining to be devastated by critics?"". The first battle of the movie is really great, the visuals are stunning, the army is unbelievable, the action is mostly well-shot, it actually has a good story/concept and both Matt Damon's and Pedro Pascal's (Pero Tovar) characters seem interesting ... What could possibly ruin this movie?!Well, basically that's the only entertaining part of the whole runtime. The second and third act are basically trying to put the audience to sleep, the pacing abruptly drops to a slow-burn for the rest of the film because the characters are just awfully bland. William has a very interesting past, but the script's lack of depth and creativity doesn't allow Matt Damon to shine in this one. In fact, this was the first time ever that an actor's accent messed with me: Matt Damon, you should've starred yourself on Manchester by the Sea ... You'd maybe be holding an Oscar right now.The visuals are really beautiful for most of the runtime, but the CGI monsters (which are great, in my opinion) sometimes took me off the film when close-fighting with someone. After the first battle, every action scene is too predictable, cheesy and not that captivating. The story fails to hold the audience's attention when the action stops due to its simply bad script and characters that don't even fit into the film (Willem Dafoe is in this movie for no purpose whatsoever).Also, the last act is super choppy. There's a lot of footage that we didn't see, The Great Wall was probably intended to be a 2h30 epic, but I guess their time run out and they just delivered what they could. The tone is unbalanced, I felt like I was watching an American blockbuster, then a Chinese film and then just a bad drama of sorts ... It's just a mess.The Great Wall has great visuals, a good first act and a concept with some potential. However, the rest of the film lacks script's creativity, characters' depth, and captivating action. The first battle is awesome, but from that moment on it's a horrible slow- burn, with bad dialogue, an unexplored interesting past from Matt Damon's character and a super cheesy, unoriginal and predictable third act. Damon's performance it's far from his best, but Tian Jing (Commander Lin Mae) and Pedro Pascal are surprisingly good in the middle of this mess. Still, not enough to rate this movie positively ...MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Great Wall

90,RussHog,Panda Express > The Great Wall,3,18 February 2017,"This movie is about two greedy rogue's from Europe who seek gun powder and enter China. They find The Great Wall of China - guarded by some warriors who protect the main city from creatures spawned from greed. If the rogues fight alongside the warriors - they will cast off their greedy ways and become warriors and heroes and hook up with hot Chinese general babes. One of the rogues fights alongside the warriors. The other does not. The one who does redeems his honor and is no longer greedy and he hooks up with a hot Chinese general babe. The one who does not goes to jail - but eventually he gets let out because the movie has a happy ending when the creatures are killed. This movie has bad CGI - bad writing - and no characters worth caring about. The monsters are a bore. The costumes are lousy. The fight scenes are dreadful. The love interest is flimsy. What really sucks is that this could have been a great movie with a buildup to an epic battle. Instead - the movie starts off with an over the top fight scene and all the energy is drained from the story and it never recovers and the action scenes never pick up - they get worse. The Great Wall is the sort of bad movie that reminded me that I am on a rock that floats in space, and my existence is based on billions of years of micro biological evolution, wherein somehow hundreds of people and millions of dollars were spent to create a mostly digital moving image experience without a shred of integrity, and that by circumstance, I ended up bored and wandered into the theater to endure this quasi-cosmic macrocosm of mediocrity.

He plays a western character. He does a great job here.The current score on IMDb is too low. It's worth about 8.5.

93,FilmFlaneur,"Great Wall, average results",7,23 March 2017,"An action-fantasy epic with Matt Damon playing an itinerant mercenary who, with a travelling companion ends up on the Great Wall of China back in the day. The wall is bustling with defence activity organised, it quickly appears, to keep something pretty fearsome out. But what? And how can Damon, viewed with suspicion by the defending class, prove his worth? Needless the say the viewer soon discovers in a welter of CGI, most of which is pretty impressive. The idea is preposterous of course, and the story itself pretty trivial (although it apparently needed three scriptwriters to sustain it). Damon would probably not be the first choice for the hero neither although he does his best. Willem Dafoe plays a sneaky supporting character, in the main sub-plot looking to make off with gunpowder. Much of the film has the cultural style and manner of several other Asian military epics with brightly coloured-uniforms and the geometric arrangement of men and equipment. But with all this it is rarely boring, while those who remember the swarm attack in the original Starship Trooper say, or even the end of Samurai Jack's pilot trilogy come to that, will find themselves at home here.

The sets, costumes, armies, weapons, and locations were spectacular. All of the money spent on this movie was right up there on the screen. And typical of this director, the production, cast, and crew were well handled. Damon was OK, but his Irish accent was dreadful, a distraction, and completely unnecessary. For an actor as good as he is, it makes me think he did not want to speak with an authentic accent, as it would have diminished the box office, if people could not understand him. His sidekick was decent, played by Pedro Pascal, who played Oberyn Martell in the fourth season of Game of Thrones, and is excellent in Narcos. The humor was OK. The best part of the movie was the Commander, played by Jing Tian. She was ravishing. The kind of beauty you just do not see in Hollywood anymore, due to the emasculation of American society, in my opinion. It has to be one of the reasons why so few Hollywood actresses are really beautiful. So few. It is remarkable how few. The issue I had with the film was the monsters. These marauding beasts got old very quickly. And it seemed like most of the movie was more or less centered around them.

97,PyroSikTh,Claims of Whitewashing was the Least of their Worries,4,8 March 2017,"The story is simple, William and Tovar have travelled across Asia in search of the oft- rumoured black powder that could pose as the most revolutionary weapon of the time. Pursued across northern China, they come face-to-face with the Great Wall, which was not built for the purpose of keeping out the Mongolians, but as the last line of defence against a hive-mind horde of lizards that seek to devour the world. The wall is occupied by a vast Chinese army who look more like an army of Power Rangers; there's the black footsoldiers, the purple shielders, the red archers, the blue ""Crane Corps"", and the...yellow ones. Cue action sequence after action sequence as William and Tovar attempt to escape.The pacing is simply dreadful. This is an epic movie about the struggle between China and the lizard monsters, with Matt Damon in the middle of it all, but it rushes through everything to get to the cool bits. We open with William and Tovar being pursued by Mongolians in the desert, they kill a lone lizard, and then suddenly seem shocked that there's a massive thousand-mile long wall directly in front of them (would've thought they'd have seen it). They're dragged inside, there's a little bit of talking, and then the lizards attack. One of the big climaxes of the movie happens so soon with little character development behind it; we barely even know our main characters before they're thrust into life-threatening situations. The movie cuts randomly to other scenes, completely devoid of any transitions or thought behind them. For example there's an attack on the wall and one of the generals stabs one of the lizards in the throat by getting between it's jaws, and suddenly he's dead and they're holding a funeral. Another example is one of William and Tovar's companions just disappears in the opening scenes. There's four of them, one gets carried away by the lizard, they kill the lizard, and then there's only two of them. What even happened to the third guy?Dialogue is clunky and awful as well. This is Yimou Zhang's first English-language movie (majority, anyway), and it's clear he has no handle of English at all. Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal, and Willem Dafoe deliver their lines meticulously and robotically, using language as simple as possible, making it sound unnatural and unlike the way any English-speaker talks. Of course I can't comment on the Chinese bits of dialogue, but their delivery certainly sounds more natural. Even the English spoken by Chinese actress Tian Jing sounds better and more natural, particularly in the way a non-native speaker would speak it. This sounds like nit-picking, but it's less about the language itself, and more about how it makes the dialogue simplistic, cheesy, and just sound plain awful in it's delivery. I don't blame Damon, Pascal or Dafoe at all (well maybe a little bit), I blame the script.Linked to this is the humour, which often seems out-of-place, badly delivered, and is more goofy than genuinely amusing. There's one character who seems to be the staple of every Asian movie; a clumsy goof who can't do anything right and just gets himself into trouble time and time again, just for the sake of comedy value. Much of the dialogue jokes just aren't funny either, such as Matt Damon dissing his companion and his companion, from the other side of the door, saying ""I heard that"". Hahahaha, hilarious.I will admit though, the action sequences are pretty great. The first big battle, as soon and lacking in genuine threat as it is, is definitely a spectacle. Seeing the rainbow army assemble and use interesting strategies to combat the horde is definitely interesting to watch, particularly the all-female, blue-armoured ""Crane Corps"" (awful name, I know) who stand on planks held over the wall, with a crude bungie chord attached, who then dive into the horde with spears. The application of gun powder on arrows as well seems like an ingenious way to delivering miniature bombs onto the enemy.The other thing I won't deny is how visually impressive it all looks. Yimou Zhang is renowned for his eye for breathtaking visuals, and The Great Wall is no exception. As cheesy as the concept is, and as much as I poke fun at it, the rainbow army does look great, and creates some really fantastic imagery. Similarly, the big climax takes place in a stain-glass tower filled with a cacophony of colour that would make any television marketer weep for joy. The design of the lizards is also really interesting as well, with the grunts having their eyes on their shoulders, leaving their heads as massive chomping appendages. The queen's vibrating crown and her towering guard of shield lizards also look really cool. There's no denying, the CGI in this movie is on point.Seriously, the claims of whitewashing and cultural appropriation were the least of this film's worries. Those claims of course were complete bullshit to begin with; Matt Damon was cast to play a European character, and to draw in Western audiences (the same way a lot of Hollywood blockbusters are making sure they have Asian actors to draw in the Chinese markets), so it's not like he was taking the role from a Chinese actor (of which, to be fair, 99% of the cast are Chinese). The Great Wall lacks in every department it matters. Sure it's a great looking movie with some impressive action sequences, but there's no character at all, the dialogue is cringeworthy, cheesy, and just flat-out bad, and the story's pacing keeps it from being an enthralling experience. I was genuinely starting to fall asleep last night. I give The Great Wall a don't-bother 4/10 (saved from anything lower thanks to the visual spectacle it offers)",The Great Wall

99,stevenrotherforth,I'm quite liking these colourful apples.,7,19 November 2017,"The Great WallOn this films cinematic release I decided to give it a miss. This was down to the unjustified reviews that the movie suffered. I finally got around to watching this movie when it became available on satellite TV. Granted this is not Matt Damon's finest work and I can't see him stepping up and giving one of his fabulous speeches come Oscar night for this one. However as a piece of throw away entertainment this film ticks all the right boxes.The movie has a simple plot that The Great Wall of China was built to keep out something rather nasty. The nasty things in question are dragon like creatures that roam the land eating everyone in their path. Alive or dead! As events unfold Matt Damon's character injures one of the beasts and then stumbles upon the Great Wall where an entire army struggle to stop the monsters breaching the giant structure.I sat through this film waiting for the negativity that it was given to present itself on screen. It never came. Instead the lean 1hr 43 mins runtime was just enough to entertain me. The film looks fabulous. Colours pop and the breath taking landscapes sweep majestically across screen.Director Yimou Zhang has crafted a beautiful looking film that is partially let down by the average CGI. Don't get me wrong the effects aren't Sharknado bad, they're just a little too slick to be believable. The creatures don't have a realistic texture that brings them to life. Instead they seem over worked and there's no tricking the human eye when it comes to special effects. If it doesn't look authentic it can destroy the whole experience. Thankfully costume and set design are marvellous and this reinstalls an aire of quality that had been partially taken away by the dull CGI. The final set piece is a true feast for the eyes as a bombardment of hues shine through stained glass illuminating the scene.I think The Great Wall is best viewed in HD or 4K to get the greatest representation of what the director intended. Modern Cinema screens can sometimes appear too dim and not vibrant enough to do this film justice. It's a movie that looks good, it sounds good and by being just under two hours it doesn't out stay it's welcome.",The Great Wall

This movie is a stunning visual adventure.The two main characters are described as mercenary warriors but the terms thieves and rascals are probably better suited. They do know how to fight though and they get plenty of opportunity to prove it in the menu.This is another one of those movies that live and die by the visuals. The plot is a basic enough adventure story with some additional twists, like mysterious meteorites and really really nasty monsters, thrown in. It is not bad but not exactly groundbreaking either. The same with the characters. They are perhaps not exactly flat but not really fantastic either. What makes the movie great is the action and the visuals. The story and the characters are just there to prop the visuals up and they are doing a perfectly adequate job of it.The movie starts off in a rather dry and deserted landscape. The first scenes are actually rather dark and somewhat blurry. Luckily we rather quickly arrive at The Great Wall and the colors explode onto the screen. The Chinese army in their shining colored armor is really visually impressive.It does not take very long for the action to start and apart from the usual arrow flinging, acrobatic stabbing and slashing the Chinese army starts to deploy their various contraptions for fighting the oncoming swarm of nasty creatures. I found all the things that they had cooked up quite fascinating and contributing nicely to the visuals and the fun.For example, bungee jumping into a hoard of jumping and snapping monsters wanting to take a (huge) bit of you armed with a spear. Is that cool or what? Heck, I want to do that. Well, without the monsters of course  and the bungee part. Okay, I confess, I was just watching the girls. Did I mention that all the bungee jumpers where hot chicks? And if any of you go all feminist and gender crap on me for those remarks you can shove it somewhere. If you think the bungee jumping stuff sounds like I was watching a silly comedy then trust me, it makes sense  kind of  in the context of this movie at least.Then there are rotating knifes sticking out of slits in the wall, fireball throwing catapults, various applications of gunpowder (that was after all why the two scoundrels where there in the first place) etc. etc. All accompanied by various acrobatics by the different combatants. Each scene was both cool action and a great symphony of elegance and colors.The one part of the movie that I thought was a bit of a letdown was the parts where the emperor of China appeared. Why portray him as an arrogant, lazy thundering idiot? It is really not funny. The chain of events that he caused could really had been started in a more intelligent way without going down that overused and boring route.The movie works itself forward to a nice final, desperate, fight to defeat the monster queen and her hoard of baddies. It is a nice fight, as visually stunning as the rest of the movie, filled with lots of stunts of all kinds. The huge hoards of beasts climbing, jumping and moving in big patterns on command from the queen was really cool.For me this was one hour and forty minutes of much enjoyment.",The Great Wall
102,dcarsonhagy,The Great Wall...of Poop,3,29 May 2017,"""The Great Wall"" is pretty bad. Not bold enough to really go over- the-top with the creatures or the Kung Fu actions, all this really had going for it was the story. Uh, it's just there is no story. Well, not much of one. Matt Damon ""stars"" as William, a man ""who has been a soldier all his life."" He has a companion and they have escaped some desert outlaws. While holding up for the night, something wicked this way comes and Damon cuts off a leg. They are then captured by the rulers of the Wall and...bored enough? So was I.This disaster was miscast from the get-go. Damon shows the acting ability of a turnip, and those around him are not much better. One of the generals is a woman, but she would have been much more believable had Zang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) played her. Even the male generals were pretty miscast. However, given the movie's entirety, the producers couldn't offer enough money to cast any major martial arts actors. In most martial arts pictures, the ""silly"" ones go so over-the-top, they become fun. Not here. There was no ""wire-Fu,"" not any general was really bad ass-- nothing. Also, given the sheer numbers of the creatures, there was simply no way in hell that few number of people could have defended the Wall. The ONLY positive aspect of this big old turd was the costumes. They were very pretty...Rated PG-13 for unbelievable violence, this is just a bad movie all the way around. Had the producers and director decided to go full tilt, not only could they have produced a much better movie, but they could have also had a lot of fun.",The Great Wall
103,coreyjdenford,Minor Greatness,6,17 February 2017,"This review of The Great Wall is spoiler free*** (3/5)AFTER HIS STUNNING action packed epic House of Flying Daggers which became an international hit for shocking audiences with it's eye-shatteringly physics defying action scenes along with its strange curve of natural human abilities. Since then director Zhang Yimou has become no stranger to big-budget productions. However what he is a stranger to is accusations for being racist, we all know that movies get criticized even months before their release date but never has a film been shambled by racist comments. Which is what happened to his English-language debut The Great Wall, as soon as the trailer debuted on YouTube on 28th July 2016 the comments section was riddled with racist comments, stating that Yimou is 'whitewashing' or submitting to a 'white saviour context' through positioning the film's star Matt Damon, as the main heart over a Chinese cast. However the accusations were short-lived after hitting cinemas in December it soon became a big hit, opening on its weekend to $67.6 million which is the fourth highest opening weekend in Chinese history. The film itself has an interesting premise involving one of the greatest architectural achievements known to man, however instead of teaching us about the use of the wall itself it riffs a hint of magic, as in the film the wall is attacked by a gigantic force of monstrous creatures called the Tao Tei that attack the wall every sixty years. Here Yimou uses his natural traits well; there are long panoramic sweeps over a stunning backdrop, there is a lot of action, also like House of Flying Daggers there is a lot of physics defying blade throws and a look at the unnatural human abilities. In addition he uses a plot written by veteran Hollywood writers such as Edward Zwick and Tony Gilroy to name a couple, who tried their best to write an immaculate script for the film, unfortunately like the creatures who attack the wall the plot does a good run toward it but can't quite clamber over the fortifications. Yet, the flaws are forgivable (not hugely) because like our action-clad hero Damon, who shows to be just as handy with a bow as he is with a gun, this long-haired Jason Bourne is a crack-shot with a bow he can pull off any shot from any distance he never misses, he's essentially Hawkeye, without the wit, the action is the heart of the film. He plays William Garin a European mercenary who travels to China with his colleague Pedro Tovar (Pedro Pascal) in search for black powder, until they come across The Nameless Order an impressive army wearing colour coded armour corresponding to a different type of fighter, who are in the midst of preparing for a fight with an oppressive force. At first they are presented as trespassers who will be imprisoned within the wall's fortifications until the army is attacked. While they are in the middle of fighting William and Pedro look on at this army to look at each of their fighting skills, they are even more impressed to find that women lead by Commander Lin (Tian Jing) fight in the army, they lunge from ropes to attack the beasts, at this point it hints at The Battle for Helms Deep (mostly). Plus Yimou's transitions help keep the film at its already impressive scale by placing us in the midst of battle every time. It sounds clichéd but Damon isn't always looked at as a hero, at some points he is out-smarted, then re-educated the Chinese virtues of bravery, selflessness, discipline and invention. Like other magic based fantasy filled epics to come out of China such as Mr. Vampire or Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame, The Great Wall has solidity, yes, it's flawed and the CGI is a little rough round the edges but it's still impressive to look at.VERDICT: The Great Wall is visually stunning but plot wise it's a flawed action film with a lot of action but not much story to show for it. It's not Yimou's best by a long shot but it is a lot of fun which packs some minor heat.",The Great Wall
104,asb_deutsch,"Don't watch the trailer, ignore the critics and you will love this epic!",8,18 January 2017,"I watched The Great Wall in IMAX with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in Crystal clear images, projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with the powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!If you are the person dying to watch the same old Rogue Story or a new story of hobbits like Fantastic Beasts...just don't go. But if you really want something refreshing without the prequel/sequel tag and you don't have any problem seeing Chinese people sharing their presence on the silver screen, this movie is especially for you. You won't get disappointed at all.Damon and Pascal were very fun to watch. For Tian Jing, she was glowing. She justified her role. I also feel like planting my lips on her! 😘No offense though!😂",The Great Wall
105,gavinp9,Might re-watch if it was on TV,5,2 January 2018,"'The Great Wall' is certainly not a documentary! Not that anyone would be mistaken after seeing the poster or synopsis. One plot summary had: ""a mystery centered around the construction of the Great Wall of China"" - wrong! There's no mystery, and certainly no construction of the Great Wall - it's already there when William (Damon - I think he's supposed to have a Scottish accent, but it's horrible) & Tovar (Pascal, from Narcos & Game of Thrones) stumble upon it. Commander Lin (Jing) spares them, and they're suddenly under attack.The film doesn't waste too much time starting the fight against the Tao Tie - monsters/aliens (not really explained) that look like a cross between Wargs from 'Lord of the Rings' and the Hammerhead beasts from 'Avatar'. They emerge every 60 years (from Russia?) to attack the Chinese (for some reason) - and there's about 500 million of them, obviously controlled by a queen (end-game established), but they have their own, literal, kryptonite. There's some decent action scenes and plenty of stunts, but nothing really new.This is director Zhang's first Hollywood film and is nowhere near as good as 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers'. The editing is jerky at times and almost every shot of the Great Wall looks like CGI - I truly hope some of it was actually shot on location. The main problem is you don't care about any of the characters, as there's no backstories (no time - it's all over in 95min), with most of the generals conveniently colour-coded. The whole thing really feels like a poor rip-off of 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. Lau & Dafoe are wasted and Damon seems to coast through, being an archer/mercenary who suddenly decides to be a hero. I was wondering if the Chinese audience would hate it, but it's already made $170 million there in two months, so it was in 2016's top 10! Definitely too earnest, when it could've been funnier/more tongue-in-cheek, when it's so ridiculous at it's core.",The Great Wall
106,eberkerbatur,The Great Wall is not a good movie but it's a pretty enjoyable one,7,20 August 2018,"The great wall is not a very good movie but the viewing is pleasantI would recommend watching your movie in cinema the first place when you watch at home because you will not enjoy much of it because its theme and effects are mostly the effects that make this film beautiful, war scenes and background images
The original scenes were a little nonsense as if it was made to be a specific subject at the beginning which was not considered too much, so it seemed like it was pulled out of obligation
Then our heroes came to the famous wall and frankly I love this film because of the scenes on the wall the war scenes on the wall were really nice watching the show was so fun The image of the army of china went well the subject about the creatures went well it was just a little weak about how they came outThe scenes that I like most in the movie were the first attack scenes of the creatures so this happens at the beginning of movie and you will definitely enjoy these scenes
I liked most of the battle scenes in general so I said that you need to watch the movie in the cinemaIt is not a very nice movie but it is pleasant to watchFinally I think it would be better if the last scenes of movie were also on the wall
The idea of reaching it with the balloons is as good as the last war but the battle scenes in the capital are not as beautiful as on the wall and I think it would be better to start with the battlefields of the battlefieldI do not like the final stages in general but I would recommend the movie is a movie you can watch without boredom",The Great Wall
107,Rendanlovell,Incredibly stupid and incredibly enjoyable.,5,2 March 2017,"This is one film that I have been keeping my eye on since the first trailer dropped something like six months ago. I love Asian culture and the film could not have had a better director to get me on board. Yimou Zhang has some amazing films under his belt including one of my favorite Chinese films, 'Hero'. So I was pretty excited to see what he would bring to ""the biggest Chinese film ever"". And he did not disappoint. The film is about some dude (Matt Damon) who travels to China in order to obtain a new weapon, black powder. He has a couple of people traveling with him when they finally run right into the great wall. Shortly after being brought inside, a monster army begins attacking.What we get from here is an amazing blend of hilariously over the top action and bizarrely serious ""character"" stuff. Where this film thrives, however, is in its action sequences. Not only are they prolonged to no end but they are immensely entertaining to watch. It felt as though Zhang knew exactly what kind of movie he was making and just had fun with it.The action is, in fact, so over the top that it's frequently hysterical. Watching a green baby dragon monster attempt to scale the wall only to be sliced clean in two by scissor-ish blades, protruding from said wall, is probably the funniest thing I have seen in a big budget movie since 'Deadpool'. It's so incredibly violent and cartoony that I couldn't help laugh. Zhang seems to know how dumb and bad the script is so he just made an entertaining movie.And boy is it entertaining. Not only is it frequently hilarious with its violence but there are also legitimately eerie scenes that set atmosphere really well. There's a great sequence involving whistle arrows that is appropriately intense. But as soon as the script throws in a cliché the scene takes a hysterical turn that leads to one of the greatest slow-mo monster deaths ever. It's as if Zhang showed he could make something actually great out of this material but was handed a bad script so he intentionally ""ruined"" it.That being said, there is a lot of effort being put into the film. It isn't the lazy cash-in Hollywood blockbuster I am used to seeing. There is actually some amazing style and effort going into the film. The directing and cinematography is pretty spectacular. Not to mention the awe-inspiring costume and production design. The bright, vibrant colors really pop especially when alongside films like 'John Wick 2', where everything is dull and gray. You can tell the filmmakers cared about this film but were just stuck with a bad script and editor.This film could have been so much more than it was. And the reason it's not is entirely on the script and editing. It's probably the dumbest, the most pandering movie I have ever seen. It tells you exactly how to feel at any given moment and its characters say anything and everything on their mind without much censorship. This leads to a complete disconnect between the audience and the characters. Since they don't act like humans how can we connect with them as humans?We just can't. And this rift causes the story to crumble under its own weight. It's an interesting myth that the film is adapting but with no interesting characters to care about the film is nothing more than a monster movie. A dumb, bloated, over the top, monster movie. This is even more problematic when the film feels edited to death. The film has so many jarring cuts that bounce in between completely different settings that you can't always tell what's happening. This is specifically noticeable during the third act, which is so incredibly convoluted and poorly cut I could almost never tell where people were or what was happening. But Zhang really brings the film home. He makes the already over the top script so over the top that it's hilarious. The actual filmmakers know what they are making and put as much effort as they can into actually making a movie. While the script doesn't put forth the same effort, the film remains immensely entertaining. It's the epitome of a popcorn movie and one film that I can honestly say I loved watching. It's dumb and bad but I had more fun during it than I have in a blockbuster for a while. It's the perfect film to see with a group of friends and just have a blast watching.",The Great Wall
108,CountJonnie,Uninspired mess,4,16 May 2017,"Even if you ignore the countless clichés which you've seen before, and try to watch the movie as a product of its own, it's still a mess. You have a movie that tried to present itself as a period piece, with fantasy, action where East and West meet.West consists out of the most flat Matt Damon you've ever seen, which would put Keanu Reeves to shame. And Pedro Pascal as the witty sidekick. Why they're there is the most simple side-plot ever, as an excuse to have a white hero.East consists out of eye candy that seems out of place from the 1st second. The choreography of every move is amazing. But the clichés are so thick, that you stop caring for the eastern individuals faster than fast, which makes every person forgettable and hardly contributing to the absent plot.And there it is. The plot is one of the worst stories you might remember in a while, with plot holes that could fill the entire Chinese Wall, which in this movie is downgraded to a background gimmick.Maybe the movie would have been better without the whitewashing, but maybe it's so bad, it couldn't be saved at all. Unfortunately it is now just a Matt Damon movie, which has even Matt Damon wondering what the heck he is doing here, which is the same question many moviegoers might ask themselves.4 for the visuals, and the choreography, NOT for the story and acting.",The Great Wall
109,kaptenvideo-89875,"American production + leading star + Chinese money, and locations – what could go wrong?",4,21 March 2017,"Middle Ages or something. European mercenaries (Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal) searching for black powder become embroiled in the defense of the Great Wall of China against a horde of monstrous creatures. Also starring: Tian Jing, Willem Dafoe. Directed by Yimou Zhang.China is an attractive movie market for Hollywood and they are also eager to spend money on making international hit movies, so uniting forces to produce some epics is an emerging trend. The American production values plus a leading star or two, combined with Chinese money, actors and locations – what could go wrong?Well, in the case of The Great Wall"", almost everything. It's 103 minutes of almost non-stop action so it may appeal to some, especially it (s)he hasn't had enough of Tolkien-flavored epics populating the screens for the last 15+ years. But for others, it's lazily written, acted and put together B-movie which has high aspirations but is too dumb and derivative to achieve that. There's almost no story, or interesting characters. Even the massive action scenes don't save much, more often than not the result just looks cheap. Even surprisingly cheap, considering the hefty budget of 135-150 million US dollars. This is the most expensive film ever made with (mostly) Chinese money.The only impressive thing is how orchestrated the defending side looks, all those color-coded legions, weapons, the whole shebang. It's probably done with a lot of CGI but still not bad.I also think the whole monsters raiding Chinese Wall"" aspect is woefully underdeveloped and, in a bad way, video game-ish. They don't have much personality design-wise and making them so strong raises more important questions than the story bothers to answer. In short, the work here is weak.Matt Damon has the only noteworthy role in the whole movie, all others are filler. And even he can not make a character so shallow especially convincing. Damon is one of those top class stars who appears in lots of movies but, as a rule, avoids derivative crap. The Great Wall"" is probably the worst big project he has ever done. The sooner it's forgotten, the better for everybody.If you are interested in The Great Wall"", maybe just watch the trailer and save 100 minutes of your life. The movie sucks. You will feel tired after twenty minutes or so. Watched it in 2D, so maybe 3D version sucks even more.",The Great Wall
110,moviewiz-4,Another great historical movie.,9,6 January 2017,"Before I watched this, I surfed through the internet for the trailer, not realizing what is the story about. Now, the story is somehow inaccurate. The movie makers did a great job by adding some fantasy elements in it. Thinking of the audiences are not only from Asia, but from around the world. I believe that if the plot is focusing on the wall itself, not many people will understand what is the story about.The casts acted well. The females star acted well too (she indeed beautiful) as the camera is focusing close enough for us to see. Lots of people in it, looked great and wonderful.The action sequence is somehow looked like World War Z movie.

111,FallenEye,No Magnetic Field on the Battle Field.,5,9 September 2017,"For the sake of Zhang Yimou, I really was hoping - and a small part of me was also kind of sure - for a wonderful entry in The Great Wall, however, questionable timelines, unacceptable VFX, dubious physics and a plot that fell under attack far more often than every 60 years, made this film a great disappointment.What's funny is, while watching this movie, I kept referring to it as Matt Damon's take on Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai, with a little bit of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, just to find that Edward Zwick was on story. Anyway, in comparison to The Last Samurai, The Great Wall is a rusted fence with a random hole in the corner made out of pliers.The Great Wall was transparent and obvious in its attempt to exploit emotional tension and distress. Matt Damon with his accent was forgettable, Willem Defoe even more so, and Zhang Yimou seemed out of his depth.There were some good aspects however; Pedro Pascal delivered a much better performance as compared to his costars, Ramin Djawadi as usual was amazing on score and Jing Tian was not only gorgeous, but she also had a pretty good outing. The imagery of the army was also very pleasant and appealing, sadly the story and direction around their necessity and appearance wasted their beauty.I was hoping for 7+, or 6+ at worst, but as this movie kept going, the more it fell apart. 4.7/10.",The Great Wall
112,Aly200,"A Silly Monster Movie, but Quite Enjoyable with Decent Acting and Excellent Cinematography",7,16 February 2017,"What if the Great Wall of China was actually a gate meant to protect China from monstrous creatures? That's the basic premise in this English language debut from Chinese director Yimou Zhang and it is quite a ridiculous concept. However the film doesn't strive to be an overly serious action flick as the filmmakers inject a healthy dose of humor to set the viewer at ease.Helping to lead the charge is A-list action star Matt Damon as Wlliam, a thief who at first is out for a mysterious black powder but soon begins to learn what is really worth fighting. Damon is his usual action movie self, displaying bad-ass fighting skills including top notch archery and swordsmanship. However William is not the ""white savior"" that many have deemed the character to be; he is merely a small part of the human machine out to take down the monsters known as Tao Tei. Damon does have a lighthearted, yet appropriately contentious chemistry with costar Pedro Pascal as his fellow thief and comrade while Damon displays a potential affection for Jian Ting's Commander Lin as well as distrust that grows to trust and respect for the strong female leader. Maybe not the actor's greatest performance, but it is enjoyable anyway to see the A-list star among an international cast.Pedro Pascal (famous for his time on ""Game of Thrones"" and currently on ""Narcos"") plays Tovar, William's traveling companion and fellow thief who is equally obsessed with finding the black powder. The character's greed is insatiable as Tovar only wants to find their prize and run off, which of course doesn't go as planned when Willam becomes devoted to the protectors of the Wall's cause. Pascal is the film's comic relief as he bickers with Damon and spouts some goofy dialogue that relieves the tension. Pascal's Tovar may be a doublecrossser when it comes to his greedy nature, but there is a loyalty to Tovar when William goes into the midst of a battle and both Pedro and Matt display their camaraderie and agile fighting skills.And the final Caucasian actor in the mix is the ever reliable Willem Dafoe as the mysterious former mercenary Ballard. When the character is first introduced, Dafoe is hidden in shadow as Ballard is watching the interrogation of William and Tovar from a balcony. The character doesn't speak for the first several moments of the film, giving us pause as to whether it will be wise to trust the man or be wary of him; the filmmakers wisely chose to keep Dafoe slipping in and out of the shadows, creeping along almost like the monsters that lurk outside the wall. We learn only a little about how Ballard came to stay at the Wall for twenty-five years (through the character's own explanations) and his motives are slightly in the dark. Dafoe is adept at playing shady characters after more than three decades in the acting business and Ballard is no exception as we start to see the character's true motives. Ballard once had the same purpose as the film's two leads, but unlike William, Ballard is unable to let go of his obsessive quest. As is common for many of Dafoe's characters (good or bad), there are repercussions for Ballard's duplicitous and deceitful acts. No matter how bad a movie might be (or perceived to be 'bad') you can always rely on this Hollywood veteran to bring his A-game to the table and be enjoyable despite being the bad guy at times.As the only leading female character, Jing Ting's Commander Lin is no damsel in distress. Lin is a headstrong warrior, unafraid to challenge the two strangers who come to the Wall. She is rarely subservient to the other male characters like the General, due to the character's combat skill and fearlessness Lin is respected by her superiors and fellow soldiers. While initially distrustful of Matt Damon's William, the Commander sees a similar fierce spirit in the thief that matches her own though the level of trust remains tenuous until the film's exciting climatic battle in Bianling (the capital in the film's universe). It is thrilling to see a strong female when in normal Hollywood films we are used to seeing certain female characters be mostly damsels in distress while there are some bad-ass women.The film's cinematography is stunning as we traverse desert wildernesses to the film's titular wall and finally the capital's colorful buildings. The deserts are quite desolate as we follow William and Tovar in the film's opening scenes, the color of the sand is a mix of tan and reddish-brown. Not much of the wall needs to described except for the costumes of the soldiers. The different divisions of the army range from red (for the archers), blue (the Crane warriors (all female) who bungee-jump into the fray of battle), yellow (defenders of the wall) and black (the leaders of the army, as well the guards who will sacrifice themselves); the three Casucasian actors even have contrasting costumes as Matt Damon wears armor similar to the higher guard of the Wall's army (though slightly more brown than black, carrying red tipped props since William is an archer) given how much William is being trusted by the Chinese army, Pedro Pascal wears a dark gray costume that helps mask his character's motives towards his friend, William, and Willem Dafoe wears a mostly dark red costume reminding us of his European heritage and giving us a clue to the treachery Dafoe's Ballard masks. The film's final scenes set in the capital Bianling is full of rich colors like red, golden yellow and green all over.A fun romp that has a bit of an homage to ""B"" monster movies, but this is quite worth the time and is enjoyable. Go in expecting silliness, but a fun time.",The Great Wall
113,austin0731,A view from an Asian moviegoer,5,3 January 2017,"The Great Wall was... interesting? So as a Taiwanese movie goer 'The Great Wall' has been very much anticipated by me. However when we first got a look at the trailers I was deeply puzzled, one of my biggest issues was the costume design, why on Earth do they have all these different coloured armour, this is simply not historically accurate or makes any practical sense. I mean they look like the power rangers or something. After watching the film despite giving a semi-reasonable explanation to the coloured armour I still can't get behind it. Lots of thing is ridiculous and makes no sense in this film, from the way in which they defeat these 'monsters' to the previously mentioned wardrobe malfunction. But on top of this somehow a film made by a Chinese director is still white washed? Now obviously there are some pretty big name Asian actors in this film but Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal gets so much screen time it hardly seems balanced. For a film that takes place in China this is rather odd. The film spends a lot of time focusing on the romantic relationship between Matt Damon's character and this Chinese general played by Tian JIng. I did not feel much chemistry between the two actors and the romance seemed forced which makes it hard to watch as so much of the film is focused around the two's relationship. On the whole I have always hoped for a film bridged between the East and West to be made, a film in which both Western and Asian actors can be appreciated, in a world in which China holds lots of importance in the overall outcome of the box office I do anticipate to see such films being more of a common occurrence. This film isn't a big leap forward but it is definitely a step in the right direction.",The Great Wall

He's come to find the secret of ""the black powder"" (gunpowder), and soon finds himself captured by the Chinese, and taken to The Great Wall.The fictitious Great Wall is .. kinda like the great wall, but if Michael Bay had a go at rewriting it. Fireballs, explosions, and CGI monsters quickly follow, along with much Wuxia fighting, an all- women army, Willem Defoe in the part of ""The Guy Who Speaks English"", and the very beautiful Tian Jing as the co-star of the film.I recently ripped apart the horrible Gods Of Egypt; well, this film isn't too different, relying on CGI and over the top action to tell the story, but fortunately TGW doesn't overdo it as much, and the end result is something quite watchable and fun. The brief moments of acting are quite passable. (the only critique i could raise to Damon, is that he starts the film trying to play a different character, but quickly returns to his typical Jason Bourne thing)The Great Wall is a fun CGI film with monsters. I would recommend this popcorn film to anyone looking for an afternoon of fun, and since there aren't any scenes with gore, or particularly scary stuff, it's OK for families with kids as well.Good film. i like. 7/10 - it is what it is.",The Great Wall
115,FelipeCarrillo,A Great Wall Is Obstructed By Digital Spectacularity,7,30 May 2017,"It's paradoxical to take a look at the cosmopolitan daily newspapers these days and contemplate that while the planet is setting up for a truthful confrontation between China and the U.S. for the sake of its interests in South China Sea's disputed waters, this two cinematographic titans' economic relations are cooking at the box- office of the spear constituted by Legendary East, China Film Group and other film production companies both oriental and occidental. So, setting out the scene from an absolute perspective, are the Americans and the Chinese exchanging peace for dough? And although are unlike matters, is the money and not understanding which stirs up that two of the most powerful nations in the world join in function to perpetuate the collapse of our capitalist universe?Let's focus on the field that concerns us. It has officially commenced the struggle for preponderance in movie theaters around the negotiations between the States of the East and the West, thanks to movies from one side were a triumph in the other country and vice versa. We could see this coming for a long time; starting with the purchase of Lions Gate Entertainment, following American success of films as ""The Mermaid"" or Jackie Chan's and Jet Li's vain comedies or the partial recovery of capital investment from English-speaking feature films such as ""Warcraft"" or ""XXX: Return of Xander Cage"" which don't even managed to get off the ground in its mother country and concluding with the ineluctable kick start of co-productions, a trend that with respect to cinema, in the light of the issue, doesn't bode well at all.""The Great Wall"" is the key, a 150-million key which opens the door of victory, at least economic. Equality and inclusion have even touched this mega-production script since six screenwriters/writers are who engrave their names to the rough but eye-catching legend. It's evident how each writer instills the details of their previous works either in exegesis, creative, artistic or visual section. The story carries us to xeric European deserts, where two mercenary globetrotters, William (Matt Damon) and Tovar (Pedro Pascal), are caught by The Nameless Order after they murder a mystifying glaucous quadruped. That frightening creature, which stands for greed, is one of the thousands of ""Taoties"" that ravage the Chinese army every sixty years, looking for revenge due to their ancestors' avarice. Although they had initially thought up to steal coveted black powder, which was plenty in the prodigious empire, the two marauders resolve to stay in line and fight alongside the vivacious army against the mythological beasts.Doesn't it sound compelling? Sentinels wearing polychromatic attires — ""Power Rangers"" style — divided according to their warlike skills. They defeat their enemies using of pulleys, catapults, bullet time arrows, hot air balloons, sharp weapons, bravery and too much CGI. Director Yimou Zhang, outstanding creator of ""Hero"" or ""Raise The Red Lantern"" and organizer both Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and opening evenings in glorious film festivals, decides, in a terrible way, to give more prominence to strenuous exquisite pictures as he neglects and subordinates the story, which increasingly becomes into a buddy comedy film. Yeah, they're wonderful and it's not simple to conceive and execute- correctly-fight choreographies with such agreement and style levels with a macro-budget, however, with that risk in mind, they sign up a filmmaker who stands out for his visual landscapes full of courtliness and accordance, deplorably, they didn't expect that in his first and greatest opportunity to continue in highly expensive movies, he relegate a vital aspect: narrative development.From the initial sequence, it reveals the lack of on-screen chemistry between the leading duo, forcefulness in push-lines is what is needed and the leitmotiv wanders due to weak acting tandem. William Defoe as Ballard is a hollow and unjustified incorporation, a mere tool for attracting more spectators to cinemas. To a larger extent, they applied a similar strategy to Damon, who is an immediate commercial attractant for his charismatic, rudimentary and heroic roles; A pretty face saving hundreds of lives from a horde of demons, are they intelligent, aren't they? On the other hand, the Eastern actors, highlighting the inclusion of a fantastic warrior lady (Tian Jing), feel more comfortable than the American performers, in interesting visuals that radiate artistic and traditionalist oriental sensibility.""The Great Wall"" is another horizontal graphic direct-entertainment blockbuster, however, marks the beginning for the agreements between the English-speaking country and the Chinese titan, while providing an unusual look of the Great Wall and female introduction in a feature film of such monetary magnitude. The film is inversely proportional to its pretensions and it's comforting to witness that it doesn't focus on its emboldened main character, but focuses its efforts on the battle army, their relationships, troubles, and ambitions. Nondescript characters, powerful characters, repetitive God's eye views, a crushing mise-en-scène; the motion picture is a raffle of pros and cons that set off on the wrong foot the negotiations, however, this lacking timing and thrilling epic adventure is pleasant, is the kind of movie a 13-year-old boy can't wait to see.",The Great Wall
116,fung0,Exceeds Expectations,8,22 May 2017,"What were people expecting? The Great Wall IS a movie about medieval Chinese soldiers fighting hordes of lizard-like alien creatures. And guess what? It's a pretty good one. I can only assume people are criticizing it either because they don't like the genre itself, or for some misguided political reason.A few things worth pointing out:* The set-up, with Matt Damon as a sort of Marco Polo knock-off, is just historically credible enough, and reminiscent of many classic adventure films.* The top-of-the-wall tactics used by the Chinese - including a primitive bungee jump - are highly inventive, and great fun to watch.* The CGI lizards are very well presented. They feel real, uniquely Chinese, and very dangerous. Matt Damon's fights with them are fluid and exciting.* The art design is stupendous, up to some of Yimou Zhang's more obviously 'art' films. The colored armor of the Chinese troops is quite dazzling. The balloon sequence is a hoot, evocative of Jules Verne.* All the roles are well played. Matt Damon is his usual likable self, and Tian Jing is particularly charismatic as the somewhat conflicted Chinese officer. Dastardly Willem Dafoe (clearly having a ball on his Chinese holiday) adds a nice counterpoint.* The storyline is just about what you'd expect - which is NOT a bad thing in a genre film. Not when it's handled this expertly, and when it manages to dodge any number of obvious clichés. (For example, possible romantic entanglements do not play out according to the usual formula.)No, this is certainly not a ground-breaking film in any cinematic sense. But it is a competent one, and a very entertaining one. It stands up well against other films in the 'monster' or 'zombie' genres, which too often suffer from creaky dialog and low-budget staging. And it's vastly better in every way than self-conscious action films like The Expendables - yet currently shows a lower score (6.1 vs 6.5). That's unfair, and misleading to the many fantasy fans who'd really enjoy this film if they gave it a proper chance.That really is the point: if you enjoy this TYPE of film, you should enjoy The Great Wall. Do not go in expecting an exquisite, meditative classic like Raise the Red Lantern. This is Yimou having some fun, flexing his pure-entertainment muscles, and helping to move the burgeoning Chinese film industry into more direct competition with mainstream Hollywood. Get yourself a big bowl of popcorn (or the Chinese equivalent), and enjoy the ride.",The Great Wall

Wacth if you ain't got nothing better to do,4,22 April 2017,"I went in to this movie mostly blind.Only have heard all the critics about Matt Damon being in it. Make no mistake he doesn't add anything to the film,neither does the other two white actors.They are simply there for name sake.As far as the movie as whole go it is a mildly entertaining fairy tale, about some dinosaur looking beasts that attack the Chinese wall.And the effort of the soldiers on the wall to fight them back,with the help of 3 westerners. I would like to be able to say there was more to it than that,but there really isn't. The CGI is pretty good.Not to shabby and not to fancy. If you got one hour and forty five minute to waste,than watch it.

118,PetarNeo,Good effort but bad outcome,5,4 March 2017,"Chinese director Zhang Yimou tries to bring us closer to Chinese movies and he puts The Great Wall at test to see is there a chance for China to start producing a worldwide movies. Only thing that he did not so much consider is that he needs to make a movie that is going to be good and in so drag us to theaters but instead he made a monster movie with some pretty impressive visual effects and scenes. Great Wall is story of William Garin (Matt Damon) an European mercenary that came to China in search for powder but got in many troubles and at first encountered a strange beings which finally led him to wall and his imprisonment alongside with Pero Tovar (Pedro Pascal). It's a year when attack by mysterious being that came from outer space is going to happen and it is happening even sooner then expected but they are ready for it. It was a complete mess and movie just kept relaying on stunning visual effects and it's directing of defending scenes, giving us a view in skills of Yimou's vision of movie. It looks beautiful and there is usage of some different scenes and monsters also look pretty insane and amazing. But then we come to characters which are almost like thrown in there without anything and any try of explaining something feels boring and just doesn't quite manages to gets us in believing it. There is also Sir Ballard (Willem Dafoe) another wasted character that everything he wanted is to escapes for that place once and for all. What to say about Commander Lin Mae (Jing Tian) as she is predictable and tries to look like leader but feels like William (Damon) always leads her and manages to save her and everybody from their destruction. There is a lot of room for improvement and without doubt they will do it once more but this time they messed it pretty good and gave us watchable and enjoyable movie as long as there is some battle and fighting. 2/4",The Great Wall

Acting was awful and Damon was horribly miscast. The CGI, especially the monsters was laughable. Just a very bad movie. So many plot holes also. Why wait till the end to actually look at the battle plans from 60 years ago which gave you the answer and method to defeat them. Surely you would have been planning the magnet defence for decades. Also in the initial opening wall attack there are thousands of monsters but only like two made it up the wall and everybody stopped fighting to kill them. Ridiculous. There would have been thousands over the wall, it would have been game over for everyone in the first 15 minutes. Damon surely could not have read the script in advance before signing the contract.",The Great Wall

123,blrnani,West meets East (and is duly impressed),7,22 December 2018,"Although this is a very effective action film that holds the interest throughout, what I really loved about this film was the coming together of two very different cultures. Indeed in the beginning it was reminiscent of the contrast between dwarfs and elves in Lord of the Rings.
As a Brit I have had to come to terms with the fact that all our films have to include a well-known American if they want to be a box-office success, so I can understand how the Chinese might resent the perceived need for an American presence, but at the same time I welcome it as a way of bringing the Chinese culture to a western audience in an accessible manner.
And although it was Matt Damon's experience as a mercenary soldier that swayed the battle, it was only won through teamwork and self-sacrifice and the most impressive feature was the Chinese technology and organization, built upon a platform of healthy social values.
Another positive is the visual beauty of the Chinese cinema, which uses a lot of colour and images that are a feast for the eyes.
I hope film makers will ignore the self-righteous indignation of people looking for a reason to get angry on behalf of a cause and that we can look forward to many more partnerships of this kind.",The Great Wall

Matt Damon has a world wide pull but his casting didn't go down well in China where this movie is financed . But for pure myth legend fantasy with spectacular colours this film delivered all in abundance . Equally visually pleasing was the beautiful Tian Jingwho is bound to become a huge star in the west after this . Don't go expecting to see a history lesson as this story is pure fantasy but enjoy the visual feast that the cinematography gives of the wall and surrounding topography Even if like me this is not your genre there's still plenty to enjoy . The soundtrack and costumes were amazing . A great visual treat,The Great Wall

This was a joint venture between Hollywood and China. Hollywood wanted the eyeballs from China and China wanted the good will of cozying up to the loony leftists in Hollywood. Maybe that's why the movie is so poorly rated. The plot has a young woman, about 25 years old, in charge of the Chinese army fighting make believe creatures from north of the Great Wall in China. Hollywood is now pushing women is all leadership positions and it is the one and only 'woke' quality that China shares with the leftists. They see women as equal. Not that they would ever replace Xi with a woman but you get the idea.",The Great Wall
126,n-kefala,Not so great after all,4,2 January 2017,"The ""Great Wall"" is easily the least interesting and involving blockbuster of the respective careers of both Zhang Yimou and Matt Damon, but is so visually impressive. Not even the good director Zhang Yimou brought in for his prestige value, can save this very expensive movie from disaster, even if it's a treat for the eyes. With futuristic and historic elements and of course with a Chinese touch and the Yimou's famous choreographic scenes, and while big and cross- cultural, the uninteresting script makes this film boring. The movie opens like a spaghetti western, contains fight scenes in those that Chinese are great and all this, unfortunately, doesn't make ""Great Wall"" so great after all.",The Great Wall
127,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,"Good fun, but not worthy of Yimou",6,19 January 2017,"I consider Hero and House of Flying Daggers two of my favourite films, and certainly among the most aesthetically beautiful in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, The Great Wall is closer to being a Chinese version of Pacific Rim than it is to the modern wuxia films.The analogy to Pacific Rim should give you the necessary information: The Great Wall borders on the ridiculous, but is very fun to watch with good company. It's probably a little better as a film, which in such cases is not necessarily good.Given that it's a film where countless green monsters attack the Great Wall every 60 years, you are not allowed to be disappointed at the silliness. In fact, the silliness is the best part of it, with (very) brightly coloured armoured fractions of special units defending the civilised world by means of bungee jumping, magnets, grenades, and somehow, hot air balloons. In the midst of all this, you get Matt Damon, who is unfortunately not William Tell, and Oberyn Martell, who get caught in the middle. Willem Dafoe is also there, although frankly, he could be anywhere else and no one would notice.To be honest, my greatest disappointment was that there was not more bungee jumping.",The Great Wall
128,comps-784-38265,"The 'So So' Wall, guarding a lack of substance",6,17 February 2017,"Visually the film was brilliant, it was certainly impressive to watch it in 3d. But there are so many plot holes/poor script issues, that it lets the film down really badly. E.g. Matt Damon and fellow mercenaries are trying to find/steal some of the 'black powder' to take back west and get rich. Why? Presumably to take it to the nearest 11th Century chemical laboratory and have it analysed ? Surely they would have been attempting to get the formula/recipe to make gunpowder. So the starting point of why Matt Damon and co are in China (let alone how they got there in 11th Century) is pretty thin. OK its a fantasy film. They stumble on the 'wall' with thousands of visually amazing troops, including lovely female warriors. All have great fighting powers and clever weaponry. Apparently the wall? and the troops are secret. Duh! Yep, so hard to not notice it.Rapidly Bourne (I mean Damon) impresses the Garrison with his fighting abilities. He has a lump of magnetic ore that makes the aliens in close proximity go sleepy. A female Chinese general finds him interesting (but thats it on the romance). They help defend the wall from alien monster hoardes (the purpose for which the wall was built) The aliens breed and spawn every sixty years when they attack to feed for the next spawn.The wall is meant to keep the monster hordes away from civilisation, i.e. the capital, because if they feast on a large scale, then next time they will come back in such huge numbers, they will take the world. Damon and co wrestle with greed : take some gunpowder and run (to get rich) or help save the world from alien monsters.The battle scenes are great, very exciting.William Daefoe is a good actor, but his character was so weak. Why he was there or still alive a mystery, (A mercenary who came 25 years previously to steal the black powder) made no sense. Take the character out makes no difference to the film. The aliens tunnel under the wall and set off to attack the capital. Damon and co ride on silly fire balloons to chase the hordes and preventing them destroying the capital (and next time the world) Its the usual kill the queen (at the last minute) and you win. SUMMARY: ------------------------------------- It's a fantasy film for young teens, who don't question what they see.Grown ups will watch once, roll their eyes at the numerous flaws and never watch it again. 6/10 Not worth the price of a cinema ticket wait until it's out on TV.",The Great Wall
129,rutzelb,Very Impressive. Better than expected,9,25 May 2017,"Mercenaries William (Matt Damon) and Tovar (Pedro Pascal) are on their way to China to obtain the black powder (gun powder. The Chinese invented it). They kill a monster in a cave, but take the hand of the monster to later determine what it was they killed. They are captured by the Chinese of the Nameless Order. The Chinese are impressed that these two killed the monster. An alert sounds and The Great Wall is being attacked by the monsters called the Taotie. William and Tovar join in the fight, but what they really want is to get the black powder and leave. This is a most impressive movie. Almost epic like. The story is not true as it is based upon a Chinese Legend. The acting is excellent all around and, the CGI with the monsters (that seem to have an intelligence unlike before as the monsters only come out and attack every 60-years) makes this quite real and frightening. The fight scenes against the monsters and choreography are truly impressive. No other way to say it. Kudos. We see Chinese weapons that are hardly ever seen. A pretty Commander Lin (Tian Jing) says to end the fight against the monsters is to kill the Queen. Can they do it? Hmmm Notable: Willem Dafoe as Ballard, who came to China to get the black powder and has been there for 25-yrs as they won't let him leave with that secret. This is truly an impressive movie and was better than expected as it is extremely well done. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",The Great Wall
130,dfloro,A real letdown from a great director,5,17 March 2020,"Matt Damon, who I consider one of the best and most versatile actors of this generation, looks horribly miscast and remarkably unenthused by the whole spectacle. For her part, the young Chinese actress does a pretty good job. (I especially believed the part where she said that if she wasn't a General, she'd kill Matt's character with her bare hands!) But stealing every scene he's in, Pedro Pascal (who was fantastic in the ""Narcos"" series on Netflix) makes Matt his straight man and provides the light humor the picture desperately needed. One last thing: if you're an action film guy (and let's face facts: it IS purely a GUY thing), I'd warn you that I found all the many CGI effects busy, confusing, disgusting, and ultimately unconvincing.",The Great Wall

Damon in Zhang Yimou's controversial 'white saviour' action flick.Willem Dafoe drags himself through the exposition scenes and phones in a half decent performance. Andy Lau also makes an inexplicable appearance, and spends most of his time looking apologetic or confused.Tin Jing delivers a reasonably convincing performance as That Girl With the Hair.The plot is simple. Damon and his friend Pero Tovar are mercenaries, who have travelled to China in search of black powder.The Chinese capture them and explain that the Great Wall was built to protect the empire from a horde of green aliens that landed on a nearby mountain several thousand years ago, and attack every 60 years because of reasons.At first the Chinese want to kill Damon, but they change their minds because he is white.Damon doesn't want to hang around but changes his mind after realising That Girl With the Hair is better looking than most of the East European prostitutes he's slept with so he decides to stay and help with the expectation of getting his leg over in the penultimate scene.The Chinese are OK with this because he is white.The aliens attack several times but the Chinese manage to hold them off thanks to the presence of Damon, because he is white.Yada yada yada, turns out the aliens were burrowing towards the capital all along, and the attacks on the wall were just a diversion so now there's a mad scramble to stop them before they eat the emperor.Because apparently they want to eat the emperor.The Chinese reach the capital with the aid of hot air balloons that could not possibly fly, but Damon manages to fly one because he is white.Yada yada yada, Damon manages to kill the alien queen because he is white.The aliens all die instantly because of reasons.Roll credits, throw popcorn.I was surprised and somewhat alarmed by the unrealistic number of Chinese people in every scene. It seemed to me that there were even more Chinese people than you would reasonably expect to find in a movie about Chinese people in China. Fortunately the presence of Damon balances this out a bit, because he is white.I rate The Great Wall at 19.98 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a disappointing 6/10 on IMDb.",The Great Wall

The visuals are stunning, from the multicolored uniforms of the Chinese soldiers to the landscapes surrounding the Great Wall. The movie is a pleasure to look at, regardless of what you think of the story. The rapport between the three leads—Damon, Pascal and Tian—is very good, too. Tian especially shines in this role, and she's the best thing the movie has going for it, in terms of acting. Damon's ""non-accent"" accent is weird to listen to the whole movie, but whatever. Is the story predictable? Maybe. Is it interesting? Yes. Did it make me want to read about the history of the Wall? Yes. The origin story for the the Tao Tei is pretty predictable, too, but it works for this film. Overall, it was an enjoyable viewing experience on almost every level ... hardly the disaster some critics have made it out to be. Again, it's a fun movie, and it's not meant to be Oscar fodder.

That and the fact that more people seem to be wrongly accusing the film of whitewashing than actually watching the film itself ultimately led to one of the most disappointing trips to the cinema I've had so far this year.When European mercenaries, William Garin (Matt Damon) and Pero Tovar (Pedro Pascal), are captured at the Great Wall of China during their search for black powder, they become embroiled in the defence of the Wall against a horde of monstrous creatures.I wanted The Great Wall to be an enjoyable film but it just isn't. Save for some pretty cool action when the creatures first attack the wall, which is pretty insane, there isn't really much to shout home about at all. The film's main problem is that it's unbelievably dull for film with such a ridiculous plot.The film takes itself way too seriously which sucks the fun right out of proceedings, and the action sequences just become all too similar by the time the underwhelming finale comes around. The drab screenplay doesn't really help matters too much either.A lot has been made of the casting of Matt Damon in The Great Wall but all it is a Chinese studio casting a big Hollywood star in an attempt to bring in more at the box-office. People who claim this film is whitewashing need to actually watch the film and will then realise Damon's character is in fact European and not Chinese. Damon, Pedro Pascal and Tian Jing are the saving graces of this film as they surprisingly look as if they want to try and make the script they've been given work.The Great Wall loses a lot of credit for deciding not to fully embrace the absurdity and take a much more serious approach for me.

Anything about it must have been historical. The dress is too futuristic, the colors are too bright for AD 1010-63. Well, I wasn't sure about the colors people used at that time, though, but I don't think they know a lot about the variants of color at that time. It was a very long time ago, right? Maybe just black, white or brown? So, this movie is about the search of gunpowder by European mercenaries but they were ambushed by legendary monsters who tried to go through the Great Wall to invade the palace. These monsters have something to do with a curse from the Gods because the King was so greedy. My question is, why the monsters really look like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park? It's funny how they communicate through the signals on their heads. This movie was supposed to be epic but mostly I found this movie to be amusing. It's just lack of Yimou's touch even though it was directed by him. I've watched his two movies which are so great, historical, and so Chinese (I'm sorry if it's a wrong term).

It shows, the visuals are pretty good, but is the movie anything beyond that? No, not really.It's like the movie's only purpose was to be the most expensive Chinese film. I didn't feel like this movie delivered on anything else. At least it's not boring and it's very, very fast-paced, but a lack of basically anything interesting about it is what ruins it. The plot isn't gripping enough, but more importantly, you can't care any less about this characters. They are so bland, uninteresting and the writers never even tried to explain them. It brings in some drama and tension between them in the second half, but it's hard to actually care about that because they are never really developed and there is nothing interesting about them. It doesn't help that the cinematography is kinda bland and boring too. Yes, the CGI is pretty good (although not stunning), but with the look of this movie, it just kinda loses the appeal.But still, even though there is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie, it's not a complete waste of time. It's not long at all, it's not boring (even though it looks like that), the action is okayish and it's an okay Sunday afternoon watch.

And this story of the Great Wall of China is still incredible by looking at the sides of the movie imagining the work it took to build such a building that served as protection against strangers. This movie transposes its story with monsters and other horrible creatures who try to pass this enormous border wall against these terrible assailants.

It's enjoyable for the most part, but it needed some more excitement. It really tries to be a spectacle, but it never utilizes the premise to its full potential. It has a lot of colors and effects, but the characters are flat with the exception of one or two.Willem Dafoe is in this. I had no idea he was, but someone managed to convince him to do it. He was an all right presence in the movie. Matt Damon does everything he can with what he is given.. And what he is given isn't that much. He is a classical Action Man with Bow. Him and Pedro Pascal work OK together. They did all do good jobs with action scenes.The visuals are nice and the monsters were pretty unique. I wish the first action scene was the one in the fog. That one is more suspenseful and would have worked as a good introduction of the monsters. It would also have added more mystery to them. But, instead they show them off in full glory in the first action part. That first fight was probably the best one in the movie. The rest of it feels standard and it didn't have that much of a personality. It promises much and never truly delivers.It's still an easy watch because of the use of colors, sets and occasional humor. The premise is good, and there's a lot you could do with Chinese mythology. But, we only see so little of it in this film. It's OK. It's something you can watch without problems. But, you are not gonna get more from it. It never gets that exciting..

Matt Damon normally does a stellar performance and I'm pretty sure he was either tricked or forced into starring in this film.The UGLY well it's Matt Damon Irish accent or attempt at a Irish accent it just comes across as stupid. Another ugly point is how the aliens/monsters can go from being really smart and strategic to being as dumb as Harry/Lloyd from dumb and dumber???

I heard terrible things about it and ignored until I needed a time killer. I don't know what to think about all the complaints from critics. It's not like a 10 or anything but it's a solid 8/10. Fun and enjoyable. The design of the film is fantastic. The trailers do not do the creature design and army design justice. It's really cool and pretty to look at. The creatures are awesomely original. Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal are hilarious and eat up the screnes together. Its hard to pin point whether Tian Jing's acting is good, being a foreign actress and all, but my god is she gorgeous. The story isn't deep or interesting. This is Starship troopers deep as apposed to The Matrix. It reminded me of the action movies from my youth like TMNT kinda. Very Jim Hensonish ""story just serves the action"" as apposed to the other way around. None of the characters get to develop really or grow and Matt Damon is the only one with any depth. One of the more ignorant complaints I hear about Rogue One is there's no character growth or journey. The problem is every character is clearly given depth from the get go so it didn't need that. Every character had a good reason to be in the fight. This lacks either outside of Matt Damon. He's the only character with any weight. Tian Jing is just kind of this one note super soldier, she coulda used some sort of conflict or back story. Willem Dafoe really phoned it in and collected a paycheck. None of his bizarre scene devouring stuff here. Very disappointed. Never waste a good Willem Dafoe. It's insulting. CG coulda been ever so slightly better it was good like somewhere around Jurassic Park II, but dated by todays standard. It didn't look bad in that typical Chinese way. It was impressive in that sense.Generally I feel like my time wasn't wasted. It was a big dumb action movie and I feel like that's OK sometimes. I wouldn't call it criminally underrated, but man I wish I'd gotten a chance to see it on a IMAX screen. The early battles would have been worth the price of admission alone. In the same vein but Far superior to Transformers and the like. I think the critics coulda been a little gentler. I get the impression they were really butthurt that Matt Damon wasn't doing something oscarbaitie they could chew on.",The Great Wall

This isn't even close to a factual retelling of a historical event, but more a Chinese legend with monsters and heroes, high flying theatrics and technologically advanced devices. Matt Damons role may be controversial, but as the film is as much about the uncovering of secrets, his position as an outsider means the films artistic use of warfare becomes a ballet of colour.
Zhang Yimou makes the most of the fictional nature of the subject matter, weaving the majesty of The Great Wall with explosive cinematic set pieces. The Wall really is the star of the film, which does at least give some allowance for the script. And with a two hour running time, there's not much scope to flesh out the characters more than giving them straight forward mission statements, which also allows the film to have a high action to speech ratio, which is good.
Ok, so the use of colour in the Chinese uniforms does make them them look like they should be in a comic book and their fighting style makes Cirque Du Soleil seems sedentary, but this adds to the dramatic flair that makes this cinematic experience stand out from other large scale, period pieces.",The Great Wall

144,TheMovonka,Go Go Power Rangerswrong movie you think?,3,16 January 2017,"Dear people, please hear my words. In this pathetic tone I would like to start the exaggerating speech about a movie taking away screen time in IMAX and other highly visual entertaining cinema formats to show you a piece of trash with a huge budget.This movie can be summarized very easily, when Hon Kong movie industry tries to get over the international borders, what they do a lot with really great work, and try so hard that it hurts. Including the reviews here in this forum, speaking about a great historical movie, a visual stunning entertaining action movie with great acting.I say that is all wrong.Following some adventurers into the legendary and mystical (not historical) China to see how they struggle with their decision to finalize their mission or help a secret elite army to fight undefined alien monsters, coming out of an asteroid every 60 years in the same valley, to the same spot to do the same thingeating. That is what the Chinese wall should be here for, to stop them raiding the whole country.I would not say the story is the issue. If this is a legend about the Chinese wall, which I doubt, then it is for sure the surface of it. But that would be OK. The real issue is the commercial abuse of cinematography in all possible aspects. To market this movie globally, Matt Damon got a huge paycheck to be the ""white guy"" hero, as the Chinese actors cannot get rid of their obvious overacting style, which is common in Hong Kong and Easterns. That's absolutely OK in general as well, as most of the time it origins from a translation reason. (See Ip Man). But in this case, it is just cliché. There is a reason, why we laugh at the power rangers (JapaneseI know), there is a reason why there are cultural differences in film making, as society sees behavior and manners or ways to express yourself differently. When you show this accurately and with honesty, nobody bats an eye, but to try to be something you are not, that makes a trash movie.Yes I said it, ""The Great Wall"" is a high budget trash movie with sometimes nice and sometimes still cheap looking CGI, following a massively simplified story with bad dialogues and acting. I saw the Power Rangers on the Chinese wall. I know how important the Chinese market is right now, I know how nice the idea might be of merging movie styles, but not in form of trash like that. Matt Damon does the Nicolas Cage, if you know what I mean. Hopefully only one time",The Great Wall
145,trevor-82944,"It's Big! It's Grand! It's Wait, Why are We Fighting?",2,17 February 2017,"This is it! The grand epic of the ages! Step aside The Lord of the Rings, Ben-Hur, and Lawrence of Arabia, this is where all the action is. Of course there is no way you would think a mesh up between World of Warcraft and a real life historical monument could pass as entertaining, let alone respectful to the Chinese, but it turns out The Great Wall has proved to us all that it can be far more than just colorful entertainment!The brilliant visual director Yimou Zhang (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) has for years held the reputation of telling engaging stories within an Asian backdrop, but now he changes all that with this briskly paced adventure of two middle-aged White males with American accents. There used to be about four or five of them, until the others were killed by a bunch of creatures at night, leaving behind only a severed green paw. So the two remaining take the paw to the Great Wall of China to identify it, and to take their black powder. What are the odds that this one green paw just so happened to belong to the same species that has been the Wall's army's longtime enemy (instead of like, the Huns, obviously)? The created world here is plenty fun to explore, one where green wolf-like reptilian creatures called Tao Tei ride in organized formation towards the Great Wall, and only a stone-shaped magnet can immobilize them in their tracks. The ones called to stop this race is the Chinese army with the help of a couple of White men they just met and know nothing about aside from some good archery skills.So with their help, they prepare a new battle strategy against the Tao Tei, which coincidentally happened immediately after the men's arrival. Together, they come up with a genius strategy to overthrow the creatures' queen: aim for the eyes- that's their weak point. But guess what? They do something way more fun to watch. Their unrealistically advanced weapon technology are aimed directly for the creatures' mouth, dorsal fin, the thick hide on their back, the ground, the sky, the two inches of air between the main character, anywhere but the creatures' eyes. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?The one placed at the front of the vehicle, Matt Damon, has the biggest burden of all the actors to carry the film on his scrawny little shoulders, and he masterfully lowers his own acting efforts to make sure we care more about the spectacle itself than the humans not made with CGI. To further ensure we care as little about the drama and as much about the action as possible, the screenplay resorts to every characters' interactions consisting of ""–This is going to happen at this time. –But this can't happen because then that will happen. –You're right! What is the best way? –Well, remember when your father died five years ago and you received an engineering degree from Harvard? –Yes, now I know exactly what will solve world hunger!""That way, the action scenes will leave the greatest impression they could bring. As the army attacks those green lizards, the camera moves forwards and backwards, left and right, showing off the 3-D effects that you knew you never wanted in the first place. You may not give a hoot who wins or loses this war, but the cheap, overly polished sets by Oscar winner John Myhre (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) can distract you from your lack of care.Well, fine. Maybe you never cared when you walked right into the theater. Maybe you didn't care once you heard that this historically skewed Chinese action movie with White actors was getting made. But this steampunk sort of historical setting gets the kinda-sorta-but- not-really cheesy feel just right with a strong message of self- sacrifice to counteract the greed of the world. You could argue that the message was done poorly, but remember: this is a movie where Matt Damon teams up with an attractive Chinese female warrior to fight a bunch of green monsters. You know, it's like the Titanic! A fictional story amongst a true architectural achievement by man! Except this time it's a fantasy! Totally not disrespectful at all!Seriously though, just visit the dang monument in person.",The Great Wall

With Yimou Zhang (Hero"", The Flowers of war"") at the directing helm, visual identity and action sequences are just impeccable, creating the tension and interesting subplots. The main plot is really hyper-trash in its core, with giant tiger-like lizards invading the ancient Chinese empire led by their ferocious queen. Every single plot that comes from that premise is just impeccable in its creativity and amusement. When it comes to acting, Matt Damon is just irrelevant, while the A-list of Chinese actors is doing their part with no significant problems.

When William and Tovar are taken hostage by the Nameless Order who patrol the Great Wall of China, they are unwillingly pulled into a centuries-old fight between humanity and something much older that threatens all of civilization.The movie is an astounding and thrilling ride from beginning to end, never letting up on the action or the beautifully constructed production that weaves seamlessly with the brilliant visual effects. The cast is incredible, ""becoming"" their roles wholly, with the banter between Damon and Pascal hysterical, while the determination and steadfastness of Jing Tian's Commander Lin and the other leaders is very believable. But, what I find to be the best thing about the film is how it's not entirely serious, as there's always a certain ""playfulness"" to the action sequences (save for the final siege).Everything about the movie was top-notch, from the production design to the emotionally-charged musical score from Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones, Person of Interest). If you want a big, stunning spectacle, go see The Great Wall. It's a solid blend of action, adventure, warfare and terrifying monster-driven fun.",The Great Wall
150,imdb-45,"Awkward, embarrassingly cheesy, laughably bad script",3,28 May 2017,"Wow. The dialogue in this legend is wooden, stilted and as dense as the Great Wall. I'm not sure whether Damon has been losing his interest in acting, with his appearing pretty bored and going through the motions in Jason Bourne. Here with a terrible script and with each actor sounding like they are reading off of a script, Damon appears even more stilted and awkward. And you know things are off to a bad start when Damon delivers an impossible series of arrow shots to the delight of the crowd and total disbelief of the audience watching this travesty.Many have complained that the white man coming to save the Chinese was a horrible whitewashing of this movie. To the contrary. It's so ludicrous that it doesn't matter who plays Damon. Supposedly an orphan, given to an army of mercenaries at 8, he learns to fight by starting with cleaning the bathrooms and then rising in the ranks. Him and his men are off in search of the black powder that turns into fire (gunpowder) but gets caught in China by an army trying to fight an army of overgrown lizards. Even Willem Defoe can't save this laughable farce. He's as awkwardly placed in this film just like everyone else and his lines are just as stilted. And when you hear the actors delivering lines, you'll notice that they pull up short often because another character is supposed to interrupt them to say something naturally. Except you'll notice them giving each other space as what happens when people read from a script and the timing isn't perfect so as to sound natural.Don't say you weren't warned. It's an awkward fun farce if you can turn off your brain and just pretend like it's Jurassic Park in medieval times and white super soldier has come to save the day with his legendary set of skills. And the fact that the general leading the Chinese army is a hot looking female.... well.... prepare the usual cliché of ""we are not alike at all... but we are alike... and we'll obviously put aside our differences because this film is so darn predictable.""Let the farce begin.",The Great Wall

152,scottingram,The Great Wall Film Review,4,20 February 2017,"The new epic historical fantasy-adventure The Great Wall starring Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe. In The Great Wall Matt Damon stars in this epic historical fantasy-adventure from esteemed Chinese director Zhang Yimou. 12th century European mercenary William Garin (American actor Matt Damon - The Bourne films, The Martian) is in search of a fabled black powder that reputedly ""turns air into fire"". His quest has brought him to China in Asia where he soon becomes embroiled in an epic battle between the forces of the recently completed, heavily fortified Great Wall and an army of marauding creatures known as the Taotie, deadly enemies who surface every 60 years to wreak destruction. Garin must swiftly prove himself a fighter to the Nameless Order, led by the imposing General Shao (Chinese Zhang Hanyu - White Vengeance, The Message). A truly monumental undertaking, this latest opus from House of Flying Daggers director Zhang Yimou is the most expensive Chinese movie ever made, with a whopping $135 million budget. The scale is plain to see as Yimou unleashes thunderously action-packed battle scenes, at the centre of which is The Martian star Matt Damon. Amongst the other actors / actresses include American actor Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man films, Once Upon A Time In Mexico) as Ballard, Chilean- born American actor Pedro Pascal (TV Series Narcos, The Adjustment Bureau) as Tovar William's friend, Tian Jing (Police Story: Lockdown, Special ID) as Commander Lin Mae, Hong Kong actor Andy Lau (House Of Flying Daggers, The Warlords) as Strategist Wang, Chinese actor Lu Han (Time Raiders, The Witness) as Peng Yong, Chinese actor Kenny Lin (Yesterday Once More, My Old Classmate) as Commander Chen, Taiwan actor Eddie Peng (Cold War films, Rise Of The Legend) as Commander Wu, Danish actor Pilou Asbæk (Lucy, Ben-Hur 2016) as Bouchard, Turkish actor Numan Acar (US TV Series Homeland, The Cut) as Najid, American actor Johnny Cicco (Jason Bourne, Elysium) as Rizzetti and Chinese actress Vicky Yu (Who Sleeps My Bro) as Lieutenant Xiao Yu. Overall The Great Wall is an alright film not spectacular filled with action, violence, creatures, bows and arrows, sharp spikes, fire, explosions, loud noises, impressive shots of The Great Wall Of China, stunning scenery, horses, mountains, trails, Chinese language and many other things throughout the film. So I will give The Great Wall an overall rating of 2 out of 5 stars in what was not one of Matt Damon's best films. The Great Wall is similar to epic historical fantasy-adventure films like King Arthur, Kingdom Of Heaven, Warcraft, Snow White And The Huntsman films, Clash Of The Titans, Wrath Of The Titans, Alexander, Troy amongst others. So you can pick and choose whether you want to go and see The Great Wall or not and you might like it or you might not like it.",The Great Wall

IMO, a perfect movie is few and far between; however, when you see a possibility you'll know because it will lift you average ordinary life into something awe-struck awesome. This production, well, I don't know where to even begin ...So; consider this, a movie mixture of visual influential's. For example, lustrous scenes of panoramic landscapes, vivid colorful wardrobes, impressive militant retinue's overseeing various military cavalcades that go on and on till they fill your view, and finally the pyroglyphics enhancements that heightens the experience. Put them all together and, oh--I forgot to add CGI effects as well (OK pardon me for my digression) ... they simply take your breath away in spectacolor! The current IMDb rating does not do this show justice. IMO, the accumulative ratings were focused on poor box office turnout. In other words, bottom-line revenue flow. I suspect piracy being the catalyst in an unwarranted reciprocation, I'm sure. Any who ... if you haven't seen this, well, you had better.

157,cschultz-2,The Epic That Wasn't,7,21 February 2017,"In The Great Wall, a group of European mercenary warriors during the year 1000 or so travel to Asia in search of Black Powder, mysterious substance which is claimed to change air into fire, but which today is familiar to anyone who owns a skyrocket of firearm.During their journey, the warriors one foggy evening endure an attack by a ferocious but mostly unseen reptilian army. The savage lizards kill all the mercenaries except William, played with a lilting Irish brogue by actor Matt Damon, and his comrade Tovar, played by Chilean actor Pedro Pascal, possibly familiar to fans of television's Game of Thrones.The two surviving mercenaries in fleeing the savage reptile hoard quickly find themselves at the foot of the title structure, guarded by a regimented defense force called the Nameless Order. And the two warriors decide the wisest course is to surrender to the Nameless Order as an alternative to certain death at the hands—or claws—of the mysterious reptilian army.William through reflexive action has actually killed one of the reptiles, and takes with him as a sort of trophy one of the dead lizard's claws. He uses the artifact to parlay himself into a position of trust within the Nameless Order.Members of the Nameless Order and its commander Lin Mae, played by Chinese actress Tian Jing, explain to William and Tovar that the reptiles are actually Tao-Tie, a predatory alien species which resembles the monster from the Alien movies crossed with a horned toad. The Tao-Tie arrived in China in a meteor centuries ago during an era of corruption and greed. And thanks to the miracle of the CGI supplied by the wizards at Lucasfilm, there are literally millions of them.Generationally, every sixty years, the Tao-Tie rise like monstrous cicadas from a dormant state, to feed and perpetuate their species. Unfortunately the primary staple of the Tao-Tie diet is humans. The Nameless Order train all their lives to protect their homeland against the savage invaders. And eventually William joins the Nameless Order in defending the Great Wall and the land it protects from the alien invaders.There's apparently been a certain amount of grouching among Chinese audiences to the effect that The Great Wall imports Hollywood superstar Matt Damon as a hero and savior in an otherwise quintessentially Chinese epic. Such a complaint is understandable, but patently unfair: While it is true that Damon's character conducts himself with honor in joining the Chinese Nameless Name in defending their homeland against the alien Tao-Ties—and despite the more lurid elements of the movie's plot—the film has something vastly important to say about the importance of essential human values such as loyalty, courage, and responsibility, qualities Matt Damon's character appears to learn from his Chinese hosts.But at the same time, the character's inspiration is never revealed to the audience. We suspect that a deeper incentive drives Damon's William and compels him to act with honor, but that incentive is neither revealed, nor explained or depicted. Instead the viewer is allowed to suspect the character is ruled by whim, or a sense of adventure. In this way, the audience is left to believe William makes all the correct moral decisions for all the wrong reasons. And that's not fair to either the character or the viewer.In case you haven't noticed, Matt Damon has matured with astonishing grace from his signature boyish countenance into one of our finest and most solid and dependable actors. His performance in The Great Wall is both rich and authoritative. And while his character's sense of honor seems to be learned from his Chinese hosts, William's actions and sense of selflessness are compelling to the audience and seemingly inspiring to the on screen colleagues and comrades who embraced him into their ranks.Unfortunately the filmmakers don't allow the other characters opportunity for such expression or development. That deficiency might be the result of the frequent and admittedly spectacular battle scenes and explosions. Instead of being an epic vision of intercultural cooperation, The Great Wall eventually becomes a standard action flick with science fiction overtones and persuasive computer-driven visual effects.Infuriatingly shallow and indecisive, The Great Wall gives us fascinating and likable characters, and then gives them little room for growth, opportunity to care about them, or reason to follow them. They're bloodless cardboard cutouts instead of personalities. We are given simultaneously too much and not enough—too much action, but not enough reason for itand even less reason to care.The images depicted in The Great Wall are often jaw-dropping in both their spectacular scope and their intricacy, and frequently even their beauty: At one point the Nameless Order uses a rudimentary form of hot air balloon travel to journey inland to warn the population of impending attack. The images of the silken balloons against the sunset are breathtaking in their delicate beauty. But those images are whisked away too quickly, without giving the viewer an opportunity to linger and fully appreciate the exquisitely muted colors.Both a compliment and a criticism of The Great Wall is to mention its 104-minute running time. While the duration is not particularly noteworthy in comparison other Hollywood features, the picture seems almost truncated in its inability to consummate its various plots, and the various genres it contains.In the end, The Great Wall is memorable not for what it is, but for what it could have been With the enormous amount of talent and ability of the filmmakers involved in the project, the picture could've redefined any of the genres is contains.Instead, it's a good movie which could've—and should've—been a great one.",The Great Wall

While this isn't a great movie, again I don't see why all the hate. It's a dumb, big-effects driven action/fantasy.

There are B-grade action flicks, with horrible looking CGI which I still ended up liking because they did have this ""Story"" to tell, a world which the director/screenplay/editor had spent considerable time to craft within the movie. Hence movies like these not necessarily need to have deep budgets but definitely provide an experience which is well worth the viewers time, to give something to ponder once the credits roll.You have no clue on why Matt Damon and William Dafoe signed up for this movie because they don't qualify to play any notable roles in the movie. This movie justify a need to have a protagonist, even though to an extent the Chinese General - she does a decent job. A Protagonist is as good only as to his enemy or the thing he/she is fighting against, which the movie fails miserably here due to the lack of one. I watched this in IMAX 3D and it did have some close moments like monsters jumping to the screen but none shot in 3D. The set pieces where beautiful and so is the panoramic shots achieved in certain areas of the movie(air balloons) but overall still couldn't aid in providing the much needed soul to this movie. Soundtrack and mixing was commendable but again lost in translation because of the quality of the movie. One other flaw was the movie opens with a massive battle in the first 15 mins, and whatever came next became shallow. This was something the director could have revisited.

Often movies set in this era are dark and dreary, but this was extremely vibrant. There was a lot of Chinese dialogue which was cool to see in a major release. It had me wishing it was a straight foreign film focused solely on the Chinese characters. But, because Hollywood, they slapped a couple white dudes and even a Chilean into the lead roles and sent it out for production. Because why not? It's set in 12th century China after all. It would have been one thing if they had made those characters interesting, but I really couldn't have cared less about Matt Damon or his friend because there was practically no depth there. And you could write out Willem Defoe's character completely and the story wouldn't have been impacted. I know I've touched on accents in prior reviews, but I couldn't tell you what accent Matt Damon was doing even if you paid me. It was like a mix of Iowa and Ireland. The Chinese actors portrayed these incredibly skilled warriors that had a rich history of defending the wall from creatures unknown for generations, and they completely took a back seat to this white dude that just showed up out of nowhere. I'm not naive enough to think a studio would put out a movie with this budget and not tie big name actors to it, it's just a shame that it's necessary to sell tickets.

Don't get me wrong the movie feels kinda trashy, it has a Starship Troopers feeling to it. But it also feels more polished and thought through than said franchise. The Great Wall is a mix between typical Chinese/Asian ""over the top"" Action/Martial Arts style and Western action movies. The Army and their armour looked ridiculous but imagine the same in an Anime, nobody would question this cool weirdness. The 3D effects were alright and there were a bunch of ""through the screen""moments. If you are into Animes, feel comfy with Asian weirdness (not Japanese weird though xD)and like action movies with an okay story, go ahead and watch it.",The Great Wall
164,warren-87235,Classic Fantasy Adventure,9,23 June 2020,"Looking at other reviews, I'm not sure what some people were expecting. This is a total fantasy, and it establishes that from the beginning. This isn't meant to be historically accurate.This is a great merging of quality CG effects with old school set and prop building. Visually it is a feast for the eyes. The design work and creativity on show are outstanding, and the action set pieces are great fun.That's probably the best description of The Great Wall - it's FUN! There's enough drama, plot and characters to make you care, but it's light enough in tone to be a fantastical adventure that takes you away from the real world for a couple of hours.One thing I have to mention, is the use of colour in this film. All too often, modern movies are desaturated and given a single overall hue. It's over-done, and often a crutch to make something look stylised in an easy way. The Great Wall bucks the trend. The colours are vibrant, and utilised in such a way as to make every major element pop out of the screen.The first time I watched this, it was as a streaming rental, and it was a pleasant surprise. I've since indulged in the 3D steelbook, and it really is worth it.I love big effects-heavy action movies every bit as much as I love thoughtful dramatic movies. However, a lot of today's action adventure movies are mind-numbingly stupid and dull; Superhero 'B' has the same story as Superhero 'A' did six months ago, but has a different costume... Rinse and repeat... I'd sooner watch The Great Wall again, over any number of those!",The Great Wall

Well that is partially the case but insert some sort of alien-gremlin-dinosaur looking monsters and that's the film. There are thousands of these monsters without any explanation, as if this was expected when a person goes to China. WTH!?!? I hope Matt Damon got paid well because I can't see how he could have possibly read the script and said ""I have to do this!"" Basically Damon saves the day with his Katniss like bow and arrow skills.

I love movies, always have. It's a stretch to call this a movie.""The Great Wall"" is awful, just terribly awful, 3 out of 10, based solely upon computer-generated imagery, costumes, music, and artwork, the closing artwork in particular. BTW, the closing credits run for over 10 minutes, and that's a good thing . . . the movie could have been 10 minutes longer! The lists of ""Digital Artists"" exceed the population of many small towns. It took me two sittings to watch the entire movie – and credits. If it were not for making this review I would never have gotten past half way. The story is absolutely dreadful, surely written by eighth graders. The script and dialog are worse. The movie's single thread of interest is a peek at the Great Wall of China – or imagery of it – but there is woefully too little of that and way, way too many million, no zillions, of green-bleeding ""monsters"" resembling a couple mean dogs that terrorized me as a kid.Say more? Why? Stay far, far away from this mess.",The Great Wall
168,svikasha,A Chinese Monster Slayer Story That is worthy of a Global Audience,7,19 June 2017,"The English language has always been the preferred medium of film. However, local film industries around the world are getting better. The Great Wall"" was the first English-language film to ever be produced by the Chinese director Zhang Yimou. The production was a joint venture with Hollywood and needed hundreds of translators just to coordinate the diverse multi-linguistic cast and production team. In this film, Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal of Game of Thrones royalty play European mercenaries who travel to China to find black powder. On their way, they encounter mysterious monsters and end up staying in China for a fight to save humanity.Although ""The Great Wall"" was panned by many critics in the west for the lack of diversity in the cast and the ""whitewashing"" of history, if one can manage to ignore the hyper critical lenses through which many judge this epic production, then one can still find an enjoyable film. It's hard to understand what key element this film was missing that caused it to be so disappointing at the North American box office when compared to other markets. The film certainly had the production value to be a blockbuster. The film is made to be in English, but the vivid visuals that are just as much a part of this film are universally captivating. Perhaps this is why the movie did so well at global box office despite its poor domestic performance within the United States. ""The Great Wall"" was the most expensive film to ever be shot entirely in China at the time of its release. Even though the movie lost money in North America, the film was saved by China's domestic market. The film earned over $171 million in China alone. That's nothing to scoff about. Hopefully it will encourage future filmmakers to produce join multi-cultural ventures like, ""The Great Wall"".At its surface, the plot of ""The Great Wall"" isn't anything particularly special. The film avoids a human enemy and invents a monster called the Tao Tei that gang up and devour people. In the spirit of almost every alien invasion movie, the people of the ancient world must unite to fight the spread of the Tao Tei to China and the rest of the world. Although the plot was predictable, the film deserves a lot of admiration for the fighting choreography and costume design. People think of ancient China as dulled ancient terra cotta warriors and a giant gray wall. But the terra cotta warriors were once painted with color. The wall was once a vibrant and constantly developing feature of the region. ""The Great Wall"" truly brings both of these features of ancient China back to life. At times, the audience will be captivated by the beautifully painted Chinese armor and the realistic looking CGI wall. Overall ""The Great Wall"" was a solidly entertaining flick that offers a serious glimmer of hope for people holding out for more diversity in the future films coming out of Hollywood. The world is truly hopeful that the ""box office disappointment"" label doesn't discourage future filmmakers from making similar films. Despite the profitability and popularity of ""The Great Wall"" globally, it's truly disappointing how coldly western audiences received a film that had all the right ingredients of a proper blockbuster. It makes one wonder if the film would have fared so poorly if it managed to avoid the casting controversy. Either way, western audiences are a tough nut to crack. But this film was a worthy attempt.",The Great Wall
169,ahmad_nadal,Well !! I Didn't Hate it at all,7,25 January 2017,"One of the best visual and entertaining experience of The great Yimou Zhang who brought to us some of the memorable Chinese movies. I was totally impressed by his technique in picturing the defense of the Great Wall of China against the monsters. The machines that were used by the Chinese army were very creative and enjoyable for me and I believe to all the audience.I am not saying that the story could have been a lot better and it has more than few mistakes but that doesn't mean that I really enjoyed the movie. From the mistakes of the movie is the relationship between our Hero William Garin (Matt Damon) & Commander Lin Mei (Tian Jing) which wasn't that emotional and I really didn't care about it at all which makes it a mistake. One the other side we have the relation between William and his friend Pero Tovar (Pedro Pascal)which was very good and ended perfectly.In total it's an entertaining movie, no more no less, so don't expect more from it.My rating is 7/10.",The Great Wall
170,templar77099,Below average,4,20 April 2017,"Well, this was bad. Not the worst, but still, I had some expectations. I was looking for something light to watch and ""The Great Wall"" made the bill, but still, I don't think I'd make the same decision now, because its being quite hard to decide whether this was worth of my time. First things first, the imagery was the best aspect of the film. Some striking shots, mostly recourring to CGI, were well made. But here comes the first problem : inconsistency - some CGI shots were good, but most were so fake and poorly made. I can't understand how they achieved this gripping difference in terms of quality. The acting is bad. I can't understand what Matt Damon is doing here. Pedro Pascal is probably the best bit of it - specially if you have seen him as Oberyn in GoT. The rest of the cast is not that good, even Willem Dafoe. The action was average, with some good concepts here and there. The OST was the other positive. It contributed to give the film the epic scale it was looking for.Ultimately, I can't quite recommend this one. You can watch it, sure, and you might like, but it just didn't do it for me.",The Great Wall

Still, it had just enough action, humor, tension and grand visuals to keep me on the edge of my seat longing for more. Also surprisingly Matt Damon did an excellent job as the reluctant hero.

However, the graphics used to create these monsters were brilliant.Matt Damon as a European mercenary, Tian Jing as Commander-In-General, and Willem Dafoe as Ballard have justified their respective roles. It's Matt Damon's never-seen-before performance in the move that gives it a rugged look and feel. Story-line is very thin two European mercenaries travel to china in the quest of black powder (like super gun powder) - that explodes in the air and would instantly kill - and get captured by Chinese soldiers. How they save the northeastern territory of china by fighting the monsters behind one of the greatest wonders of the world - that is 5500 miles long and took 1700 years to build - makes the rest of the story.The background music has Chinese feel to it. Like any war movie, lot of drums are used to create the war-like feel.Legend or myth, this movie deserves to be watched for its brilliant action and war sequences with these intelligent monsters.

The opening scenes and fight sequences were the best thing about the movie. The story was not very impressive and the only thing that keeps it alive is the action scenes.

An ambitious project that probably will not pay off but provided an enjoyable ""private screening"" for me--me being the only one in the theater for that showing. 7+ stars for effort and entertainment.

There were a few big plot holes. One of the biggest was without saying any spoilers was that they built the wall to protect the world from the monsters which attacked every so many years but obviously everyone knows it took centuries to build the great wall.

The movie has pageantry and color galore, Drum beats pound away, while flying warriors bound up and down, trap doors open, fireworks explode. And all this is accompanied by the barest of plots, the more outlandish it gets the better it matches the rest of the spectacle. Insert Matt Damon into all this, and you come up with the China-American hybrid idea the movie makers were supposedly after. The plot and screenplay are kind of pedestrian, but I would rather pay $15.00 and get this sort of entertainment at the local IMAX, rather than driving 4 hours to see it live in Vegas.

182,joshteggert,"This messy, mind-numbingly boring Chinese production does not fulfil any expectation",2,21 March 2017,"There is no way to decorate this simple statement: 'The Great Wall' is a monstrous disaster. The largest China-Hollywood collaboration yet, and the first blockbuster movie to be filmed entirely in China, it hasn't set the bar very high for future international releases from the East and doesn't deserve to stand as any form of landmark for this type of production.For a film about a 5,500 mile-long wall with the aforementioned derivements, it is only natural that worldwide audiences were optimistic about 'The Great Wall'. But even the very foundations of the film are flimsy: following the mercenary soldier William (Matt Damon) and his partner Tovar (Pedro Pascal), the ""whitewashed"" duo encounter an army of Power Rangers protecting a wall from a mass of 'The Lord of the Rings' Wargs Version 2.0 with the overarching ""end of the world"" threat.The visuals, one of 'The Great Wall's main selling points, fluctuate consistently from scrappy to clean cut, and this can be very distracting. Some battle scenes are indeed pleasing to watch, notably the bungee jumping warriors who sweep down the wall to kill as many of the monsters below as they can. Yet this in no way makes up for the horrific contrast between the plastic, cheap-looking armour of the army and the unpolished special effects throughout the film, nor the unconvincing surrounding landscapes, that piece together incoherently to form this untidy, chaotic concoction of terrible movie-making.However, it is the script and the story that is its most catastrophic downfall. Constantly using weak plot devices and action movie clichés that we've seen countless times before (e.g. the reluctant hero earning redemption, a mindless army with a classic vulnerability and communication method etc.), then juxtaposed by stereotypes of Chinese culture that are arguably more controversial than the ""whitewashing"" scenario. It is unintelligent popcorn fodder, failing to keep, let alone grasp the attention of the viewers.""You can write this s**t, but you sure as hell can't say it."" – Harrison Ford This statement from Ford is dismally prevalent here; Matt Damon cannot decide on an accent or tone for his monotonous character, delivering lines with cringe-worthy dullness, he barely hides how little he wants to be there. Jing Tian (as the Commander of the army, Lin Mei) is so detached from the film she may as well have been CGI as well, and Willem Dafoe (as Ballard) plays an empty character who serves only to explain why Mei can speak English. The writing is abysmal, and talent is surely wasted here, only adding to the pile of missed opportunities in 'The Great Wall'.",The Great Wall
183,rs403404,'The Great Wall' isn't so great,4,7 March 2017,"The famous Great Wall was built to keep out the evil hordes: people with a lot of problems, drug dealers, murderers rapists, and (I assume) some good people. Wait a minute, wrong wall. Regardless, The Great Wall embraces a new direction currently seen in filmmaking. Many movies, like Transformers 4, have featured Chinese locations prominently with the hope of getting into Chinese theaters. The rules to get into Chinese theaters are long and complex and the rules as to how much money an American studio can make from those theaters is even more complex. So, US-Chinese co- productions like The Great Wall could become the rule rather than the exception.Consequently, the story behind how a movie like The Great Wall gets produced, is way more interesting than the movie itself. The Great Wall is movie where things happen not out of natural plot development or character motivations, things happen because the script says they happen.The best example of this lack of plot development is the revelation that the creatures made it to the other side of the wall. How they accomplish this daunting feat is neither explained nor shown to the audience. Suddenly, a guard tells Matt Damon that it's happened and that's that. Perhaps the creatures paid a toll?Speaking of which, the creatures and main villain of this movie are simply put ugly green poorly rendered computer dogs. Not creepy ugly like the Predator or Alien. Just ugly ugly. Additionally, they express no motivation or intelligence for their machinations beyond the need to get food for their queen. That's the limit of their complexity, this from the main antagonists throughout the movie.I guess I could go into Willem Dafoe's role in the movie, but then I'd quickly be doing more work on his character than the script did. Further, Matt Damon's character has a friend (played by Pedro Pascal) that travels with him throughout the story whose contribution is nearly non-existent.In fact, one could streamline this script and tell the same story with just Matt Damon's character and a selection of random guards. One could argue that all the extra story lines and characters are red herrings. However, that would imply that these elements at one time seem important. They never do. The movie is nothing more than generic throwaway monsters versus shallow throwaway heroes.Sadly enough, some good ideas are here. For instance, to signal how they'll attack the creatures the soldier use drumbeats to unify their action quickly. This is not only a nifty military technique, but, more importantly, provides a good driving bass to the action and, unfortunately, is criminally underused here. The use of color on the Chinese soldiers is frequently beautiful. However, the way they attack the amassing hordes from the wall swiftly ranges from very cool to very stupid.Presumably, they could create a decent video game from this movie, which brings us full circle to the techniques movie makers embrace to make money.I watched trailers for this movie and although I didn't expect great art, I did think it could be dumb fun. Well, I was half right.",The Great Wall

This movie is so bad, its good. I swear, I laughed consistently at the movie countless times! This movie is so poorly made, that I cannot believe I actually saw this movie on theatres. Even some bad movies that recently came out are made with some effort. This movie did not even try, the effects are atrocious, the green screen is very noticeable and the practical effects look fake. The acting is awful, even Matt Damon, an actor that I love, is so horrifically bad that I did not believe how he acted in the movie. The production design is laughable, its filled with unnecessary colors that got explained in the most dumb way. The action sequences are filled with slow-mo, it never worked, and it was hilarious. The editing was try-hard and it was also funny. The opening scene alone told me that the movie was going to be horrible. There is no character in this movie, not even an attempt.

Came out in the month where movies expected to be blessed with negative reviews, it was no surprise that I thought it would be one of those ill-fated movies.In the end, I've underestimated it.""The Great Wall"" follows William (Matt Damon), a mercenary who tries to obtain the ""Black Powder"", a deadly explosive, only to get caught in a battle against monsters that awakens every 60 years. For those who doubt that it will be good, mark my words: Don't underestimate this movie. The movie was a surprise all the way to finish. The acting was great, The visuals were amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, and the action were incredible. Matt Damon as always gives a fine performance as the hero (Heck, even his Mandarin, although only a word, is very good). Andy Lau were also great as Strategist Wang in his first Hollywod movie. The biggest surprise was the female lead played by Jing Tian, she's really good and surprisingly, pretty fluent in English. William Dafoe (I not expect him to be in this movie) is also very great. Lu Han (Yes EXO-L's! It's EXO's Luhan!) is a scene stealer. Although he has a small role, He's very good at acting and truly one of my favorite characters in the movie. My criticism was it's plot. It's basic idea is like Independence Day with Chinese culture mix. Although it actually worked very well, but *SPOILER ALERT!!!* Kill the queen or we all die?"", come on writers, you can do better than this. Another one is the length. A 100 minute movie isn't enough for a story with this kind of scale. If only the studio made it like 2 hours, it would be better for more character development and understanding the story.Additionally, I don't understand all the negative reviews, especially from Chinese audiences. I'm a Chinese-Indonesian, and I absolutely love this movie. I saw criticism about the main lead being American. I'm telling you, there are 5 main leads in the movie, and *SPOILER ALERT!!!* 3 of them are Chinese, Plus most of the focus IMO are directed to the Chinese main characters. Another one is that the movie isn't based on the legend of The Great Wall. This is a fantasy movie, so of course it's not! The film even mentioned it in the beginning!!! To me, these negative reviews are purely hate for this movie. I think that most of them haven't seen the movie and simply hate it for no reason.

I did't think it would be as blatantly ""white savior"" as it was. It was almost worse that they made hero #2 a Chinese woman. It was just so typical.Chinese people SHOULD be offended by this movie.Rightly so. Matt Damon looks out of place as the great white warrior. His character tries to tone down the savior bit with personal flaws and the ""I'm not all that great"". It's short lived. Before you know it, he's doing tricks with bows and arrows like you might see in a Wild West show.What I liked: Much Chinese dialog. Plenty of proud Chinese moments (however it seemed forced like the movie had to or it would face an even bigger backlash). Even though the secondary hero was a Chinese female and it felt obligatory and like pandering, at least she was strong and a good actress. They didn't show a love interest between the western man and the Chinese warrior female, Thank God. I would have barfed. I kept saying ""Don't kiss her! Don't kiss her!"" I am glad she didn't find him attractive or made any kind of move on him, as so many white male fantasy movies show minority (minority in the U.S.) women doing. It's stupid, and not realistic.What I didn't like: The CGI. It sucked. The monsters aren't very scary, and there is too much motion blur which means they covered up a lack of good CGI. Common trick, but usually when the budget is smaller. I'm not sure why they had such bad work in this major motion picture. I didn't like the premise. It probably looked good on paper, but it was a stupid reason for them to end up in China. Most of the dialog was in Chinese, but the writing wasn't very sophisticated. There was some stupidity in the writing. The also made the Chinese Emperor look like a scared fool. That wasn't necessary. Even visiting the Emperor's palace was an odd thing to add in. Seemed really out of place. I know they felt they needed a secondary location, but it was forced and an odd choice, in my opinion.Was this a waste of time? Yes, but I was intending on wasting time anyway, so I wasn't angry. Should you see it? Maybe, if only to see Matt Damon in a wig. And if you think Chinese women are awesome, which I do. If you do see it though, be sure not to pay too much. It's not worth the full admission price.",The Great Wall

The story it's pretty linear and enjoyable, everything flow in the right direction and there aren't big gaps. Cast works well but I have to say that i didn't noticed some great interpretation, maybe the supporting actors are better than the most famous. Also because there isn't big evolution of the characters and you can imagine everything from the beginning to the end. What i really appreciated in this movie it's the environment, the shots design and the attention on the action scene that sometimes are very similar to video game cinematic. I mean cinematography,choreography, costumes, environment ...details and also visual effects are really well done, they are the biggest appreciable things in this movie,and you can watch this movie just for that, they deserve it. I think with the script they had they could do something better, recreate more emotion and intensity..everything flow..but too easy without leaving to much. The enemy's story and the background could be really done better and more interesting, maybe less easy and childish and more deeper. I just don't want to spoiler..but it's the weakest part of the movie. For the cast and story development it's just a 6 with all the others stuff like visual attention , environment design and visual effects could be an 8..so in the end it's a 7",The Great Wall
190,VanillaHammer,Open your mind and enjoy,7,20 March 2017,"It's easy to see why this movie didn't do well in the USA. Asian actors in main roles, having to read subtitles throughout the movie, having to use your brain because the story isn't spoon fed to the viewer. Must suck to be so used to Hollywood blockbusters you can't open your mind to other movies.Anyone who has watched other Yimou Zhang movies like Hero and House of Flying Daggers would know how he loves to use colours as an expression of the story and he hasn't disappointed here with a visual feast and some stunning scenery. There is no problem with the CGI in this movie, regardless of what other reviews say, and Matt Damon plays a European mercenary (with an American accent) not an Asian character that the #hollywoodwhitewash movement wants you to believe. This is an enjoyable action adventure and worth a watch provided you have an open mind and not a pre-conceived idea of what the movie is going to be.",The Great Wall

No swearing, no sexual situations, or even romance. While it won't win any awards for the CGI it is highly dependent on, or Matt Daemon's acting (surprised?), it does keep the action and story moving steadily and I think young (""young"" being a key word here) kids who spend a lot of time gaming, or are more accepting of films that forego many of the necessities of a great film for the more financial 'benefits' and imaginary allowances of those that use CGI with an almost reckless abandon, will probably have a good time watching and as I said, it's 'family' friendly.Such being the case, it's likely that parents who may sometimes roll their eyes into the back of their heads at the mere thought of having to suffer through yet another animated movie, or worse, can breath a sigh of relief.

197,roundtablet,definitly a miss,3,10 June 2018,"I normally think you should judge a movie not by what you wanted to see, or what you expected but by what you actually got, but god damn we are speaking of a movie here made by none other than Zhang Yimou, not only one of the best directors of china but maybe even the whole world. This man made more masterpieces in my opinion than any other director I can think of, so it's natural that I expected some quality. Surely he made his bad movies, every director did, but Great Wall is on a whole other level of bad.I think most of Yimous movies share 3 traits that he uses very well in his better movies. I want to go over those 3 and see how he uses them in his newest movie, ""the great wall"".So firstly, many of his movies have incredible visuals. They have at least some shots that are breathtaking. He likes to but famous natural sights in his movies but he also knows how to handle lighting and architecture. The best examples I can name is his works with colors and leafs in ""Hero"", or the incredible atmosphere he created with the red lantern in the movie surprisingly called ""Raise the red lantern"", 2 movies which are nothing other than masterpieces and you really need to watch them if you haven't already.
Now in ""the great wall"" he takes the famous rainbow mountains of Zhangye Danxia as his visual landmark like he previously did in his movie ""A Woman, a gun and a noodle shop"" but more than that he puts a CGi version of the Great Wall of China over it. The wall looks obviously computer animated (so it wasn't good animation) and the whole scene looks rather ridicoulus if you ask me. When you watch this movie you will mostly see CG images and crappy ones for that, ones that you can immediately spot and which just make the shot seem ugly.A second trait I think his movies share is that they all have a unique story to tell. He seems to not like to repeat himself because all his movie feel very different from one another and frankly even from other Chinese movies in general, in terms of storytelling. If he picks them up or comes up with them on his own, most of his stories, diverse in tones as they are, are always unique and interesting, full of characters with personality and charm.
What happened in this movie? I didn't care about any of these characters and the story is just a ""monster beat them up"" for no reason. Sure it is different from other Yimou movies, but this movie feels like you have seen it a thousand times before. He doesn't go into any depth or any motivation of any of the character. All of the characteristics that we do have of the characters merely function as plot device; everything seems so forced and shallow.Lastly Yimou likes to put in drama in his movie, and perfectly crafted one for that. In other movies of him you can see that by adding great acting and engaging music you can even make death scenes of characters you didn't really care about sad. Best examples would be ""to Live"" and ""Riding alone for thousands of miles"". 2 very stunning and thought provoking movies and very recommendable.
But neither has ""the great wall"" great acting nor engaging music. The only scene which became remotely engaging was when one of the soldiers threw away a bloody piece of equipment of a fallen comrade onto a pile of even more of these bloody pieces of equipment. It was basically the only good shot in the entire movie because it worked as a reminder of the deaths this fighting costed by just a mere 1 second shot, creating emotions and a bigger understanding of the sacrifices that are made. I really needed more of this in the movie.The movie also plays around the idea of friendship and trust among soldiers. The Chinese soldiers claim to be a big family and this idea plays a big role especially in the identity crisis of the main character. He comes to them in a selfish mentality and through this experience changes. The thing is, I didn't buy it. We never see trust and friendship among them, they didn't even mourn over the hundreds of their ""family members"" they lost. On the other hand, the main character shows a way bigger bond with his companion he arrives at this wall than any of the Chinese soldiers.A fun fact and also a bit of a spoiler is that all of Zhang Yimous other movies have a certain kind of ending, I won't say what, but if you have seen a bunch of his movies you should know what I am talking about. Strangely enough, this movie has a complete opposite sort of ending and I can't figure out why. Maybe it was because he kind of tried to cater this movie to American audience, or he wanted to try something different, but I think his old style fits his movies way more.",The Great Wall
198,ttandb,Good movie; especially if you like Asian entertainment,8,24 August 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Great Wall' - as a British fan of Asian entertainment, not least their dramas and movies, it was a breath of fresh air. It's a great shame that Western audiences generally didn't understand the premise behind movie but that, to put it bluntly, is their loss. The SFX were exceptionally good; the acting was excellent - the subs worked in the places where Chinese was spoken and overall the interaction between East and West was entirely believable.Next time it should be an entirely Asian enterprise - perhaps try to garner Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese, etc investment and stars. That way we big Asian fans here in the West can still see it by buying the subbed DVD, and yet it can be better aimed at THEATRE audiences in Asia who DO understand the mythology and legends surrounding the Wall, unlike 'Joe Bloggs' and family in the West who just don't understand, and don't want to, Asian culture, heritage and history. The latter is sad but true.I genuinely really do hope there is a sequel; it's entirely possible to do so. Either in a later era of the Chinese empire or even present day. I think it's possible for the descendants of all the main (Asian) characters to be on the wall in present day China, or at least a later era. Other than that, have the original narcissistic and brutal Chin emperor being forced to face off against these monsters because of his debauched corruption; and then being forcibly sent to his mausoleum to be incarcerated for eternity as a hope to stop what still comes to pass in the current movie. It could be tied in with being the reason as to why it has ALWAYS been strictly illegal to investigate the first Chin emperor's enormous tomb even in present day China. I have read that there is some talk of the government possibly allowing limited archaeology to take place - what if that let a dormant Queen TaoTei and megalomaniac emperor out to wreak havoc?Even today with our military 'toys' we'd be hard pressed to fight such an enemy as the TaoTei. Sure nukes would work, but it would also make most of China uninhabitable so unlikely to be used. I'd like for it to be a prequel - the story behind why the TaoTei were sent here in the first place; the reason the wall was even built to start with (in this mythological movieverse at least). This is a good movie slammed by critics and viewers who just didn't get the Chinese mythology behind the story and historians who were trying to see it as a docudrama about the Wall.Watch it - you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was; it really does NOT deserve the negativity it's garnered.",The Great Wall

The fact that it is made with dual language makes it even more ridiculous and unbelievable. It should have been either in English or Chinese. I watch Chinese movies with subtitles all the time and some are magnificent, specially the ones​ from Hong Kong.To my surprise most mainland Chinese have supported this movie cos they simply enjoy ANY publicity on the global stage.

203,showmethemoviescontact,The Great Wall ShowMeTheMovies Review,1,10 March 2017,"An attempt at a bombastic creature-feature resulting in a pathetic excuse for a film, with little bother for pacing or any form of decent storytelling, The Great Wall does not keep up with modern-day CGI or acting quality in the slightest.Basing a movie around one type of enemy; that being one creature in this film, is entirely dependent on whether that monster poses a threat to the protagonists at all. Creating a creature which appears threatening or terrifying is not a simple task, the likes of a huge franchise like Alien took an entire movie to build the Xenomorph into the icon it is today - and The Great Wall does not manage this. At all.The reptilians that are known as the Tao Tei in the film are not threatening at all, their presence in the film is so prolific, they behave more like rodents rather than any form of adversary for the protagonists. The first attack upon the wall is within the first 30 minutes from tens of thousands of the Tao Tei (so this isn't a spoiler at all), and they all simply retreat because Matt Damon manages to kill one of the beasts, despite the fact it appears as if they are beating the humans.The greatest threat to the Nameless Order (the army and defenders of the Great Wall) is Ballard (Willem Dafoe), who is only interested in deserting the wall to save his own life, and that seems to be conveyed as the worst crime anyone could ever commit and is worth far more focus and screen time than any monster that could be a 'real' threat.The acting and character writing in the film is on par with films like Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones or Star Trek: Nemesis. Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal's characters are supposed to be best of friends even if they seem to disagree with each other consistently throughout the film on whether it is worth staying to defend the wall with the Nameless Order, which implies that William (Matt Damon's Character) believes that his contribution among an army of tens of thousands will make a measurable difference.The only decent performance is that of Willem Dafoe, who does the best job he can with what role he has been given - which honestly isn't a great deal. The portrayal of General Lin (Tian Jing) is not unique at all, and Matt Damon didn't really play a character at all. Ideally, the film would have had a main character with some form of relationship with any other character and would show some actual emotion rather than murdering monsters and pretending to do the 'honourable' thing by staying and fighting them, all whilst being praised as a hero for literally managing to kill one beast alone.The truth is that this movie does not make sense, the ending is as unsatisfying as anything that came before it, and the only parts of the movie that look visually impressive in the slightest are the shots of the wall from afar, which are plentiful by the end of the film. There is some obsession with using slow motion to a ridiculous extent mid-action to the point that it is jarring to watch at times in this movie, and the pacing is so basic that the film is repetitive by the end and it's only just over 90 minutes long! To spend this much money on creating a movie like this is basically laughable, and the intent to blend Eastern and Western film isn't a success here at all; purely an eastern-influenced, poor-quality Hollywood picture. I'm certain it is very much possible to merge influences from genres and cultures both east and west, but this pitiful film certainly feels forced.I could not recommend this laughably-rushed movie to anyone, and frankly I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me.

204,owen-47103,The Corn Ball,3,14 May 2019,"Another visually beautiful but rather empty patriotic (not to say propagandist) picture from Zimou Zhang, this time with an incongruous Western star (Matt Damon, phoning it in) headlining as opposed to Jet Li or Zhang Ziyi.A picaresque comic-book plot involving a secret army fighting elaborate (but largely unconvincing) alien creatures storming the eponymous Great Wall, provides the carelessly-sunk hook upon which Zhang enthusiastically drapes his rich visual imagination, with the kind of broad, sweeping scope and heightened primary-colour definitions that have become his trademark.There's plenty of action and a strikingly good-looking cast, but never even the slightest amount of depth or meaning to any of it, and some of the battle scenes - while certainly inventive and kinetic - are so ludicrously over-designed as to be laughable. The monster antagonists are given only the slightest of explanations, and in any case never become anything other than giant, snarling, green-skinned locusts looking to devour all in their path, and as such present a pretty one-dimensional threat.The performances are all terribly earnest but rarely engaging, and Damon's peculiar choice of accent (Irish, Scottish, English, what?) grates even more heavily than the leaden, speech-bubble dialogue he solemnly pronounces in it. And, for all of the film's obviously lavish production values, the CGI is sketchy, with some seriously 2-D traveling shots of the wall, along with some hazy creature effects that sometimes resemble sweepings from the cutting-room floor of Starship Troopers (1997).Probably fine for small children and undemanding teenagers, but ultimately a very minor film.",The Great Wall

And it tells it so beautifully! The cinematography is breathtaking and for all the duration I was more than a movie spectator, I felt part of that legend, a character from that story, present among the troops defending the wall. If a movie succeeds in delivering such an experience, the rest is not important anymore. In this point, I don t care anymore about plot holes or historical inaccuracies, because I came to cinema to see a fantasy, a Chinese legend with monsters and heroes. And there I was, in a war story, set in a different world, filled with amazing elements of the old Chinese culture, surrounded by exceptional warriors, beautiful landscapes and bloodthirsty monsters. I am very saddened to see the negativity among critics and public surrounding this movie. Complaining about historical inaccuracies or being racist about the mix of races is so misplaced.

Sure there were plot holes, and some of the cgi could have been better, particularly in the last 3rd of the movie, but that didn't detract from the overall quality, and the action which more that made it up for it.I can only conclude that some people have never seen a Chinese made movie and not familiar with their acting style, or Chinese culture generally.

This is not debatable, they are quickly becoming a player in the movie market and while America kowtows to China to get a slice of the pie, China wants to expand their base...hence Matt Damon.This film has been done often and with much better results. Anyone that think the action sequences are killer needs to watch Hero or Grandmasters or any number of other Chinese films. The story was beyond ridiculous and the acting was was just plain bad. Chinese people on the whole thought the film was HORRIBLE even with Matt Damon and I was inclined to believe that there would be no love from the American audience. At least they didn't fall into the cliché of ""White man saves China and gets the girl"" I guess their was someone with some pride on the scene.

209,skylerisaac,"Director's Cut, Please",7,4 March 2017,"Let's talk about the good stuff first. The Great Wall is a visual spectacle and a feast for the eyes. The CG is excellent and believable, the costume design is nothing short of magnificent and the action scenes are exciting and spectacular. The film largely consists of Chinese actors, and any of you concerned that Matt Damon plays the part of the ""white savior"" cliché have nothing to worry about. If anything, his character is mostly a spectator, a cipher through which the audience can experience the on-screen wonders with a sense of awe. And awe is the correct term for this film. Director Zhang Yimou (Hero, The Flowers of War) has had plenty of experience with action and here delivers a spectacle that only a truly visionary filmmaker could bring to life. The creature design is also top-notch. The monsters look original and menacing, which is something I haven't seen much of in CG-generated monsters lately, and something that I personally appreciate very much. That's not to say that the film is without flaw. Clocking in at a mere 104 minutes, including credits, it feels much too short to properly convey the feelings of a secret order that has long been at war with a monstrous opponent. Also, some scenes seem shortened, doubtless a result of studio-mandated edits. Hopefully we'll see a Director's Cut Blu Ray release some day soon. Also, some story elements are under-represented. The Nameless Order exists in name only. Little, if any, backstory is offered for the organization, which is disappointing as their existence hints at a very rich backstory. My next problem is with the characters portrayed by actor Willem Dafoe. Dafoe plays the part well enough, but the character is simply not interesting. Again, little backstory is offered and neither is any character development. Add to that the fact that he's given a significant sub-plot which takes up quite a bit of screen time and the result was that I simply didn't care. Spoilers ahead, so please be warned. Let's talk about the ending. Damon's character gives up a romantic opportunity with the Nameless Order's general (played wonderfully by the unbelievably beautiful actress Jing Tian) in order to free and return home with the person who completely betrayed him and left him to die. The pure stupidity of this decision aggravated me to no end. But overall these problems don't dampen the film all that much. The film still works, and those action scenes are sweeping in their scope and absolutely stunning in their originality. All in all, I still recommend the film very much, especially if you, like me, are a fan of Zhang Yimou's work. Go out and see it. 7/10",The Great Wall

Damon is raw and bold and transforms himself into a character so unlike his past work, he seems like a different person. The plot centers around the need to defeat some very ugly CGI-derived creatures who threaten the Imperial City, and probably is too much for small children, but otherwise this is good family fare, rare in the cinema these days.

219,glennmeerten06,An A for effort,6,6 February 2017,"First of all, I'd like to praise the marketing for this film. I had no idea what this movie would be about. Thanks to a brilliant trailer campaign, I was expecting a great epic and quite possibly, a monster movie. Not revealing the monsters was brilliant! Trailers should get us excited to see more, not show us every story beat of the film (I'm looking at you Batman v Superman). After Matt Damon's Oscar nominated performance in The Martian, I got a bit excited for The Great Wall. Sadly, The Great Wall turned out to be a mixed bag of disappointment and untapped potentialPLOTWilliam and Tovar, portrayed by Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal respectively, are two mercenaries searching for ""Black Powder"" to sell back west. They quite literally stumble on the Great Wall and get involved in a war China is waging against... monsters (quite possibly aliens). And thus begins a great adventure in which Matt Damon can shine as the great hero, China didn't know it needed.REVIEWFirst things first. The Great Wall is a beautiful looking movie. The shots they managed to put on screen are genuinely gorgeous. Yimou Zhang knows how to compose and frame a shot and especially the action sequences look fantastic. It's a true breath of fresh air to watch comprehensible action that doesn't rely on shaky cam to be convincing. Adding to the great shot composure and framing, is an excellent production design. Yimou Zhang chose vibrant colors for the armors which not only set apart the different kind of warriors within this army, but also added a lot of much needed but unexpected color to the film. It's very clear that in these aspects, The Great Wall shows tremendous potential and effort. John Myhre and his team of production designers should be applauded.Where this epic fumbles the ball, is in almost all other departments. One of the most glaring issues I have with The Great Wall, is that I simply was not invested in the story or characters. The opening sequence does a terrible job of introducing the protagonists. The film throws us right into a chase scene that eventually amounts to nothing worth while. The baddies our heroes are running away from, aren't the main villains of the film... They reappear in the film, once. During this opening sequence we are treated to a terrible first encounter with one of the Toa Pei monsters they'll end up fighting on The Great Wall. With about 10 different shots, angles and camera movements, jammed together within a second, you'll end up having no idea what just happened. Luckily, the action scenes improve tremendously throughout the film. The editing in general does not however.The biggest problems holding the film back are the editing and the script. The movie feels annoyingly choppy. I really got the sense that a lot of scenes were shortened or cut out which is disastrous for the pacing. At one point, one of the characters of the Chinese army dies. By that point, the film has done a terrible job of fleshing out this character so you're just sitting there feeling numb. The scene itself is handled poorly as well. The death and subsequent funeral seemingly take place in the course of one freaking minute. It felt like an entire sequence was cut out and the death and funeral scenes were glued together. It felt sloppy and very poorly edited.The script is probably the biggest issue I have with the film. The writers tried to implement an ark for Matt Damon's character that on paper could really work. However, because of the terrible introduction of our hero, we don't get a clear picture of who this William fellow is at the start of the film. Therefor, any form of an ark injected in the film doesn't work because we have no idea how the protagonist specifically evolved. Throughout the film, some aspects of William's character are revealed. But choosing sloppy executed exposition scenes will certainly not enhance the storytelling.The Great Wall can be classified as a monster movie. One of the most crucial aspects of a monster movie, are the monsters. The designs for the Toa Pei army are pretty cool. It's cool to see an intelligence driving these monsters forward. With different classes within this possible alien species, the Toa Pei army feels like exactly that: an army. The Toa Pei show a great deal of strategy and have a very creative way of communicating with each other. It's a bit of shame that the filmmakers chose to put all their cards on the table in the first battle scene of the film. Twenty minutes into the film you've seen everything there is to see as far as creature designs go. A gripe I have with the creatures is that they are not very frightening. Creative and cool, sure. But not particularly scary. I would've loved to see some more small scale variation among the creatures. Disappointingly, the backstory on the Toa Pei army is pretty lackluster.The CGI in The Great Wall is inconsistent at best. The computer effects look great at times. But they look average or sub par more often than not. The film could've benefited from some practical creature effects as well. It's a shame we see none on screen. But because the movie heavily relies on CGI, the mediocrity of the effects is all the more glaring.CONCLUSIONThe Great Wall shows great potential. There's a lot of effort put into the cinematography, production design and action scenes. Unfortenately, the film suffers from sub par editing, sloppy screen writing and inconsistent computer effects. The final result is a slightly above average monster epic that never makes good on any of its potential.",The Great Wall
220,zensurfer-31578,Beautiful Movie,10,20 February 2017,"I always mark spoiler alert (just in case). This is one of the best action movies I have seen in a while. It has fantastic visuals. It also has great colors, just like in 'Legendary Amazons'. The special effects are well done and feature some interesting points of view. I saw this in IMAX 3D which I recommend, as some of the special effects are more spectacular with it, I found myself ducking more than a few times. I was disappointed that there was so much English dialogue, but when the Chinese spoke among themselves they spoke Chinese (with subtitles). Tian Jing and Andy Lau were great as the 2 main Chinese characters. Although I was disappointed with the 'white man helps save the world' bit, I understand this to be a financial decision so that a wider audience would be reached, but it does not diminish the movie.",The Great Wall

222,rehams,Entertaining commentary on China and the world - past and present,7,19 May 2017,"For a great many years, the West has been the dominating force in the world, some would say we still are economically and militarily, however the West is no longer culturally dominant. The opposite in fact, much of the world, notably China has rejected the post-modernist Western culture.And thus we stand in 2017 with China, a dominant economic power, looking to build its own culture and mythos, and just as important, to bring this culture to the rest of the world to influence and persuade ""the barbarians"" as the West used to do with Hollywood.That makes for an interesting watch. What does China want to show us, how does China intend to seduce and persuade the westerner? The Great Wall tells us a great deal about that.The Great Wall has a simple but effective plot. Two Western mercenaries travel to China to trade for black powder, but end up almost getting killed by some beasts. It turns out these beasts, the Tao Tei, are amassing to attack and devour China, the last stand for humanity against the evil hordes and that's where the wall comes into play, built to repel not the Mongols, but the Tao Tei.The Tao Tei, or Taotie, are a mythical creature from Chinese mythology, a symbol of greed and gluttony. The battle at the wall, becomes a metaphor, the Middle Kingdom, walling itself off, despite its implied superiority, to not succumb to greed and gluttony and want of the world.Similarly, the Chinese are portrayed to know the power of gunpowder, but to refrain from using it, due to its devastating power. The machinations of propaganda is felt.The movie does many thing well. It's very pretty, its use of color almost kaleidoscopic in its beauty. It's nice to see something which isn't shades of gray, brown and black, so common in Western cinema. It has some fine battle scenes, worthy of Lord of The Rings (a clear inspiration), though they do drag out.I found the most interesting parts in the meetings between the mercenaries, Matt Damon's role, vs the very pretty Chinese actress. Here we get to see the Westerner as viewed by the Chinese. They - we - are selfish, individualistic, adrift in a pursuit of fortune, but we're also brave and strong. We do stink though (take multiple showers a day when visiting China).As the film progresses, the selfish rogue Matt Damon seems to find purpose, trust and sacrifice in the Chinese hierarchy and order. No doubt a clear message intended for western youth: You are adrift a sea of individualism and material want. We offer you order, grounding, hierarchy.It's well done. I like it. If this is how China intends to deal with the world we are probably going to get along. I believe most of the negative reviews are from Hollywood insiders and fans, many of whom probably do not like the message portrayed to us here. How does it feel when the shoe is on the other foot huh? I give it 7 stars. Entertaining, not great, amusing at times, rarely thrilling. Lacks humor and romance. Maybe next time will be better?",The Great Wall
223,sleepyhat,Quite a surprise,6,21 March 2017,"Chinese production has tried to keep up with modern Hollywood style, but was never quite up there. This is the first one, especially for someone with no expectation. The cinematics told an ordinary but gripping story with extravagant visual effects.However, some casts and makeup failed at an epic level. All the Chinese actors and actresses had Oscar Red Carpet makeup at all time. That's a war zone, not an emperor's palace. The biggest failure is the female cast. Bad acting, crafted face and expression, concubine makeup style and shallow image. Her alone took away 4 points. Pity!",The Great Wall

However, the graphics are a bit poor and unpleasant for the movie's scale and budget.

If you want to be entertained in a mindless fashion, then go rent this from Redbox or wherever, sit back, and lose yourself for 90 minutes or so.

227,JephyrX,Beautiful & Absurd,4,16 August 2017,"When I heard about the plot for this movie I thought what could go wrong.After watching it — there is apparently a lot that did.First of all the movie is generally beautiful to look at. There are epic vistas, amazing architecture, sweeping camera moves, and colorful/interesting costumes and surroundings.Enter Matt Damon who puts on some kind of weird accent — that sounds a bit like an Alaskan Inuit — whose performance is ""comfortable"" but not inspired.The actors around him are generally pretty good — although some key roles are terribly miscast.What sends this movie off the rails is a script that meanders around a very weak ""love"" story, a lame sci-fi nod, bad CG, ridiculous scenarios, and the go to for every film-maker alive without a decent story to tell: gigantic battles filled with CGI HORDES of combatants climbing all over each other. If you've seen ""World War Z's"" zombie scenes — you'll get the idea.Then you have the moralizing — which today's film-makers can't seem to live without. In this case: Weapons are dangerous and must be kept from people (except when needed to blow up your enemies), that young women can do ANYTHING...including being generals of armies before they're 22, and that white Europeans are either benevolent good-guys or greedy villains.As for the ridiculous scenarios — I actually found myself laughing at how over the top they were. If you think people should bungee-jump into battle — this is your film. :) With all the money that is spent on movies — I can never understand how so many can end up this bad.",The Great Wall

I was disappointed in the latter's presentation, though there are so many creatures, that their relentless attacks and numerous deaths distanced me from the urgency the film tries to project.The film differs from the graphic novel I read (borrowed from the local library) which is more take no prisoners, give no quarter, and none expected.There are so many Cantonese and yes, Mandarin films starring or featuring Mr Lau, or filmed by Mr. Zhang, that I would recommend above this effort.This show is not memorable, though it is not entirely forgettable, either.If I could recommend a fanciful film, that achieves more by showing less (creatures et al), I would say, Try ""The extraordinary adventure of Adele Blanc Sec.

He just never seemed to be able to emote to match the scene, but then that's been his rap since day one. His flat performance subtracted from the overall good movie.There were a few other annoying devices in the movie as well. The bungee jumping women warriors was just plain silly.

It was damn cool so many troops and commanders that leads them against hordes of monster at the one of the seven wonder of the world, the Great Wall of China. Seems promising right! damn yeah...First of all the opening wasn't dragging long talks of what's the movie is all about. You could say the opening is almost close to the trailer itself at the first siege. Which is if you ask me good but it almost all stops there because the rest of the grand scale I was expecting but was lost there. The movie kinda just focus on the Taotie(monster), Lin Mei and William and the rest are just background greatness of lost opportunity. It was good when William show off his skills and imperial troops did their part during the siege to repel those damn monsters which was really overwhelming to see. And then you will later realized why those damn troops so busy on the background but where are the rest of the colored powerful great commanders that you might be expecting to display their fighting skills. Well you wont see much about them, you'll see them commanding on few clips then on the feast...Lol. The story is really good but the movie kinda just a the WHOLE SUMMARY of the what could have been a great horde movie.Well the overwhelming swarming monster attacking tactics might have been the reason why there aren't much of fighting them head on like LOTR heroes fights the orcs. But since it's a movie you everything is possible. They could have made same spots like when William and his friend fought them head on a diversion method as some of the monster got separated from the horde or when some reaches the top of the wall. I guess either in a hurry on the deadlines or there's isn't much of a budget? Common...Bottom line, I adore William's skills and his buddy fight scenes plus the imperial troops all over that spans across the great wall but nothing more follows. As even Lin Mei wasn't much show off of her skills nor fight scenes. Sorry you wont see some kung fu or flying acrobatic fighting skills like you see on some Chinese movies or the expectation of grand scale Red Cliff movie I was expecting. It is a summary of great fantasy story in a movie, the end. I will give it six out of ten but I remembered Lin's smile of cuteness so I will give a plus one instead ;).

Movie starts with Matt Damon and his friend are in search of gun powder when some mysterious monsters attack them and Matt Damon cuts the monsters hand in a blink of eyes. when they get into Chinese army, it surprises them that how this western man can kill the monster all on his own. girls fall in love with Matt Damon and leader asks his suggestions to fight with monsters. he proves his skills in archery to Chinese (i didn't expect director goes this far!) and entertains everyone. You will see this two white guy, specially the blue eye blond hair hero, fight with monsters all alone and all Chinese army are like useless. At the end, same to many other Hollywood movies, we see how white skin blond hair blue eyes western are better in strength and coolness! compare with eastern. they help china to defeat monsters and don't even fall in love with girls there and back to their own country even the Chinese general female is obviously in love with him.movie is disturbing in term of faking history and adoring eastern (a typical American thought) but i enjoyed the way, the colorful Chinese army and the weapons built.",The Great Wall

So I had resigned to an evening of mediocrity.Or worse. Instead the story was executed very well and there were important Chinese characters with enough screen time.

When a good actor looks like he/she cannot act, I think that it is a bad movie. It is exactly what happens in this movie and I think direction has a big part in it.

268,dion-perry,A bitter disappointment,4,7 March 2017,"Set in China during the height of a Chinese empire, a small band of Westerners are searching for the legendary black powder. Having been attacked by pursuing cavalry, along with some sort of creature, only two manage to make it to the Great Wall. Here they are taken captive and soon afterwards the Wall is attacked by the creatures. Very unoriginally, one Westerner, William (Matt Damon), emerges as a hero, while the other, along with a previously captured Westerner, seek to steal black powder. Predictably, William, along with a gorgeous Chinese female Commander, must save the Emperor and his kingdom from the creatures.This film had all the makings of a blockbuster, but it failed to deliver. The story was too predictable, lacked depth and emotion and relied too heavily on action and special effects to pull it through. The idea of having a Western saviour, was completely unnecessary to the story and was probably offensive to the Chinese. The potential for romance didn't go anywhere and, turning Damon into Legolas was just plain silly. Add to this, implausible wall jumping female spearmen, although nice to look at, really finished this movie off. Although the film has good action, the movie was crap and I was bitterly disappointed. I would not recommend watching it. At best, wait until it comes out on DVD and borrow someone else's copy and only if you are bored.",The Great Wall

The best aspect of this movie is that it's just over 90 minutes long. Any longer and you would be experiencing sensory deprivation as your brain cells quickly died.

It was plausible until the tiger frogs had to get together with the monkey frogs. And the special umbrella frogs I appreciate that it wasn't a documentary and maybe a few of the historical facts were askew.

Very ""fantasy"" (non historical) and not in a good way. The artistic choises for armour, weapons and such makes no sense and fits a video game or anime better than an ""epic movie"" which is abviously what they are trying to make.The good
Some very nice sceneries, especially with lots of soldier formations and the wall itself.For one, why would anyone give up the actual wall (you know, a awesome defensive structure) to DIVE into the horde of monsters on a bungee-jump and try to spear them from an arm-length?

I really liked the special effects, even if I started laughing when I first saw the antagonists. Most scenes between battles were quite awkward, full of clichés. Yet, once the battle begins, any cliché this film might have is really fun to watch and not at all annoying. What I hated the most was the unfortunate English accent... used during the Song dynasty (960-1279). Overall, the plot is quite linear and simple and is centered around one important moment. Character development was welcoming, but not impressive and definitely not unexpected. The best part was not fulfilling the love sub-plot, even though I half expected this and I would have been really disappointed if it had happened. Anyway, it was an enjoyable film with better 3D effects than I expected and many other films, so give it a try. But be open minded and admire what is to be admired.",The Great Wall

Epic directing and cinematography and striking visuals and attention to detail.I'd normally give it 8/10 or 9/10, because ofmostly poor, formulaic music, though some of the ambiance was great, like drum signaling (blockbuster syndrome)fairly poor CGI (creatures)oversimplistic storyline and arch (blockbuster syndrome)overpaced (blockbuster syndrome)good, but not superb acting from most. I'd have liked to see Dafoe, and even Lau and Pascal, who I think had the best performances, better utilized. I feel Dafoe especially was typecast and had a phone home performance, and usually does better when he's not. Hoping Yimou Zhang's next project is a sci-fi with Dafoe as lead actor! Damon was OK. Which is all he can hope to be if Jimmy Kimmel is anything to go by.I'm giving it 10/10 because I think it's been the victim of very unfair prejudice from people who accused it of 'whitewashing' before it even launched, and just assumed it was made to be an accurate periodic piece.

280,Gabs789,"Liked it more than I thought I would (opinion, slight analysis, correctness, recommendation)",7,18 February 2017,"Tip: Don't get influenced by the ratings that much. See for yourself.Warning: There are NO spoilers in my review, but there is a general characteristic regarding the main character and the Chinese people in the movie. (related to the complaints)I watched this movie on 3D and I generally liked it. My expectations were lower, especially as I saw the rating was quite low for a movie of that type - it's supposed to be impressive, therefore more people would love it. A commercial movie related to history sounds pretty bad enough, adding that the action develops in China and the main character is a white man, and that they are fighting against monsters. All that sounded like it might turn out to be complete bullshit, but...It's actually not. First of all, in the beginning of the movie there is an introduction about The Great Wall of China and it is mentioned that the movie is based on one of the LEGENDS about it. Secondly, the white men arriving there are just warriors who are traveling in order to find useful goods, and they are not presented in the best light - they are fighting for their basic needs and for their personal profit, they don't trust anybody, even their own friends. While the Chinese people are presented in a good way - they are hardworking, skillful, honourable, trustworthy as much as they could be in such times. They fight for their country and they are ready to die for it, they're not cowards who just take what they want for themselves and run away. This contrast is one of the main points of the movie.Also, there is a beautiful message behind the whole story. It's not just action with monsters. So I'd say everything unusual in this movie about which many people complain, is actually pretty reasonable.Besides that, I noticed that the effects are not that good in certain scenes, but generally they're well made. You get into the movie, it doesn't look much like a movie set, even on 3D where the flaws can be seen more easily sometimes.I generally love historical action movies, and while I prefer for them to be historically correct and I find it important, I think that sometimes it's better that they're not because this causes a lot of conflicts and we can never be sure how correct they are exactly. In Hollywood everything is biased, pretty much, so maybe it's a much better idea if such movies are based on legends and just have meaningful morals of the story. That seems to be good enough, like in this movie.There are some pretty intense moments, so if you get scared easily, maybe you should be careful with this movie. It gets tense and it's about war after all.",The Great Wall

It is interesting to see Chinese and western cinema working together but in this case it has resulted in a predictable plot where you struggle to connect with the main characters and their motives.The CGI is very average, not bad... but you would hope for something better, especially considering the budget and the focus on the monsters.The acting is very average as well, no one had a particularly week performance, but no one left me on the edge of my seat.

The Great Wall starts off pretty entertaining within the first 30 minutes or so, but it starts to slow down fast after the first encounter between the humans and dragon monster thingies. The movie revolves around the characters in the second act, and it the script doesn't hold strong enough to keep you interested. The third act is filled with dumb scenes that make no sense that have no payoff.

287,MovieChopper11,Big budget does not mean big movie!,4,15 May 2017,"I like Pedro Pascal! I definitely like Matt Damon! What can I say more about a sacred monster as Willem Dafoe? Nowadays, for most of us, the name of Matt Damon put on the wallpaper guarantees the movie will be good. Maybe not excellent, but at least good! I guess The Great Wall has to be the exception that confirms the rule... And what an exception! I can understand there's maybe a competition about who's movie has the biggest armies, the scariest creatures, the greatest landscapes, the most spectacular costumes, the most epic music and so on. But to transform all these in some kind of producer's fetish is a little bit too much for me. Besides that, I cannot imagine how an Oscar winning screenplay writer (yep, Damon again!) accepted to play in TGW using that script! From the beginning to the end, the movie is fragmented, just as they would have cut a piece here, a piece there and gluing what was left in what you saw on the silver screen. Bad plot: once at 60 years, some green monsters came out from a mountain and try to destroy the world. The Great Wall and the soldiers watching on it are the only defense in order to protect China (and the world) from being wiped out by greenies, which are stupid enough to try only to destroy the world of the other side of the wall. They don't know about West, just East! Of course, Matt Damon (a mercenary sent to find the Chinese legendary gun powder) will save the day, with some help from Pascal until some point and with Dafoe being the villain. The film even solved the problem of speaking in English: Dafoe has taught them before (he was forced for some years to stay with the Chinese)... Really???Great costumes, I'm not joking! Great cinematography! Unfortunately, a lot of wasted CGI for the monsters which looked like some DNA disordered rhino-lizards that were drinking water from the cooling tanks of Tchernobyl! A lot of wasted talents: Damon, Pascal, Dafoe and the Chinese cast, which is not bad at all. Needless to say you would expect more from Yimou Zhang!

290,mbooker-4,Surprisingly Good,8,20 August 2017,"I may be overrating this movie, but there are a lot of details about it that I really liked.Quick summary: Two Europeans come to China during the Middle Ages looking for gunpowder. They find it, along with the Great Wall, an army of mutant monsters, and a technicolor Chinese army that has been preparing for the invasion for the past sixty years.Things I liked: 1. It wasn't a story about White Heroes saving Helpless Asians. The protagonists were all quite capable. 2. The plot wasn't needlessly complicated by an annoying antagonist. The Taotie are sufficient to drive the conflict. 3. The costumes. Wow. So lovely. 4. Tian Jing. Wow. So lovely. 5. Speaking of Commander Lin, she doesn't wind up in a romance with the European (Matt Damon). There is affection and respect, which makes a lot more narrative sense in context. 6. The Crane Corps. It's explained why they are female, and they die like flies...but they die well. The scene with the bloody rings was truly disturbing. 7. The hot air balloons. It's epic when the heroes need to travel in a hurry and end up using a mode of transportation that is a complete flaming death trap. 8. The fact that the demon dogs ((remember Thundarr the Barbarian?)) aren't idiots. Yes, they zerg rush like lemmings, but they're a lot smarter than they appear.

293,maxdbarr,Good cheap entertainment,8,17 February 2017,"Hat 1- Story: OK, so... this isn't much of a story film. A couple of white men with somewhat unidentifiable accents are in China in search of black powder, but wind up in a bigger war. So, what's wrong with that? From the opening title cards, you can tell this isn't going to be quite as grand and noble as you might expect a film like this to be. To paraphrase- ""The wall defended against many enemies, some real some legend.... this is one of the legends."" When a story begins with such a simple statement, you can't really expect much, and there are a lot of things in this that are too perfect. A lot of this film is simply visual spectacle, and we'll get into that in a minute. But it's enough to carry you through, though it doesn't give you much to chew on.Hat 2- Performances: One of the best parts of this film that's nice to see is that it challenges a lot of what Hollywood has done recently, from a casting perspective. All the characters are the proper race that they would have been in this time, and one of the lead characters, a commander who becomes general, is more than capable female. There's no useless romance for her either. All in all, the cast does a fine job, and nothing is offensive about it. Hat 3- Craft: OK, so this script is god awful. The dialogue is bad at some points, laughable at others. What does work in this film is it's visuals. The effects are good, but what you're really enjoying here is the design. From costumes to sets, this film takes full advantage of the beauty of ancient Chinese aesthetic and style, and uses it to it's full advantage of how beautiful it can be, even in a war setting. It is this, along with some pretty well-done action that is horribly edited but well organized enough to come through, that makes you keep watching. Hat 4- Entertainment Value: This film is never boring. Sure, it never engages the mind body and soul, but it's solid empty calorie entertainment. It's an action spectacle and a grand slash fest that invites you to a world old enough to be considered ancient, but still within our historical radar. Hat 5- Memorability: Whether this will be remembered or not is hard to say. There are some very nice visual elements in this film that could stay in some audience's minds, but honestly I'm already forgetting the plot. This director Yimou Zhang has done some unbelievable films, and honestly this is one of his weakest, but that still doesn't mean it's entirely unwatchable. It's very watchable, but it's the kind of film you watch and forget. If that's what you want, this is a very good film to go with.",The Great Wall
294,Neil_Williamson,Too much cgi,5,8 October 2018,"1000s of CGI monsters that bear absolutely no threat whatsoever. 
However, the film is very colourful and would be a good one to test out a new TV purchase. 
There is no real story to speak of and I found it boring, but you could have it on in the background while getting on with other things, and glance up to watch the action scenes and the wide palette on show.",The Great Wall
295,kspindler-1,"Beautifully shot, well-acted action blockbuster.",8,6 January 2017,"Synopsis: A band of desperate European thieves follow the Silk Road into China hoping to steal the secrets of gunpowder from the Chinese and return to Europe as wealthy men. As their numbers are whittled down by wayside bandits, only Matt Damon's and Pedro Pascal's characters reach the border of China and are astounded by the size and majesty of the Great Wall. What manner of foe could possibly threaten such a construction?And so begins The Great Wall, a movie that exceeded my expectations in every way. This was an all-out action movie that explored the themes of greed and sacrifice, nobility and savagery. Zhang Yimou's masterful direction elevates the movie above standard action fare, giving us moments of truly astounding visuals. His use of colour not only adds to the visual flair, but also helps to add coherence to the movie while the editing is never confusing.Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal had good chemistry and were obviously having a blast. Andy Lau displayed the necessary gravitas require of his role, and overall, I believe all of the primary actors did a good job. However, with an incredibly taut running time of less than 2 hours, viewers expecting in-depth characterization along the lines of ""Hero"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" will be disappointed. I would go so far as to say that the quiet scenes were a bit lacking, leaving the audience emotionally cold. The Great Wall was made by Legendary pictures, now a Chinese-owned Hollywood studio. Its 160 million dollar budget allowed it to hire both WETA and ILM (the CG was fantastic IMO), but at its heart this is a movie that is directly derived from a long line of Chinese fantastical action movies. Viewers should adjust their expectations likewise.",The Great Wall

I viewed this in an almost empty theater with a couple friends and we laughed our asses off. The unintentional comedy and Matt Daemons terrible appearing and disappearing accent made this movie hilarious.

298,TwoWardrobes,Big in China,3,27 November 2017,"As a regular poster of unrealistically positive reviews of Chinese movies from numerous fake accounts, I am disappointed that so many people have actually watched The Great Wall and given it a rating of less than 10. It's the bestiest, spectaculariest movie of all time.I jest. In all seriousness, I watched Dragonblade too, which is another East meets West production hybrid, and this one is better. It doesn't have Jackie Chan singing.The movie will do what it was intended to do, make money in the Chinese market, and I suppose could be a bit of creature-feature fun for Sunday afternoon ... but it's really not very good (from my admittedly Western-biased opinion).They've spent a lot of money on the CGI but haven't realised that less is more. The green alien things are a bit lazy looking and awfully prone to being killed in mid-air whilst trying to pounce on a goodie (although if you down a shot every time it happens it could be a good drinking game). The 'killing the queen' solution to defeating a seemingly insurmountable enemy has been done to death too. It looks pretty in places but so much else of it is slapdash and half-baked.The acting is OK but there really isn't an awful lot for them to work with. There are lots of superfluous characters, Dafoe's being the most obvious, and the dialogue is terrible. Still, there are plenty of people that are hard of thinking that will enjoy it. 3 STARS.",The Great Wall
299,alen_tab,Interesting and entertaining,7,19 March 2017,"We have used to see Matt Damon in great moves, basically ever since he stepped onto a big screen. This one is of genre he hasn't had the chance of doing just yet. Having seen him in this Asian spectacle made me think that there are some actors who just can't do it wrong - obviously he is one of those. If you are seeking for a lot of fun, action from the first to the last minute - but without cars chasing down the road (which is boring to death) this movie will be perfect. Just lay down and enjoy. It has story, actors, different culture (considering how little do we know about China's history - legends especially - it seems as if that's a whole different world), and...well...more or less predictable twist. But nobody said this is a perfect 10 movie. It could be better, but for sure comes as a refreshment in an era of super-same Marvel and DC special effects stuffed movies. This story is above all interesting and it's not dragged across 3 hours like it's these days' practice. Some may complain about that, but I found it very convenient. The movie will start rolling from the first minute on - no time to waste scenario - end that's exactly what's been going on in the movie - fun and action. If you are looking for the combo of two, this is your movie. Overall 7, due to the fact that just a slight touch more of a dialogue in the build up of the story could have been added. Nevertheless, it's a very good movie and a definite recommendation.",The Great Wall
300,doctorboat,Uhh it was good.. but not great.,6,15 May 2017,"I watched 'The Great Wall' Because of Zhang Yimou. He is my favourite director, so I had hopes that I would be pleasantly surprised by this movie. Out of the 13 films of his I have seen so far, it probably is my least favourite. But it had it's moments. Pros: Of course the cinematography, it's pretty awesome throughout the film. With enough natural beauty combined with some great action- shots. The action is decent. With only a few of close-ups and a small amount of edits, so you can see what is going on. Plus 'The Nameless Order' are entertaining to watch when you see the contraptions/techniques they use. The set is brilliant, along with the costume design. Red for Archers, Blue for Crane troops. I've got time for that. Most of the acting is good. Jing Tian as Commander Lin was the standout for me. Considering the language barrier, you shouldn't expect top levels of delivery. But generally, its alright. The score is also fairly solid.Cons: Willem Dafoe. Why was he here? Who knows.. The Taoties are pretty poor. Generally a pretty dull design, and special effects that are nothing to right home about. Sometimes they look okay, but other times they completely clash with the awesome set/costumes and you can see how average they look. Matt Damon's accent. Its okay most of the time, but he has random lines which come out as American.. I think I heard some Scottish in there on occasion? The pace was completely off. It says 103 mins, but the credits start at 92 mins. It's too short for what it wanted to accomplish. It rushes from point to point, with little to no explanation as to why. Things just happen because they need to happen that way. And we must get there somehow! And I think because of this it seems the plot has problems. I think the plot is actually not bad, There's just not enough time to tell it all.Conclusion: If you want a fun, short action/fantasy film, you will probably get some enjoyment here. If you want an interesting world with a deep story, it's too short for that and you would be better of finding something else.",The Great Wall

The plot is so SHOCKINGLY bad that it's as if the producer kidnapped Damon's kids and would only return them safely if he agreed to make this movie.

A very simple, predictable and bad plot. No suspense, no new expecting of something different happen, because the plot is too easy, even for a 8, 9 or 10 years old child. The acting, of all that good actors, was average or very poor, totally disappointing for the expectation created around them.Finally, I must to say, the movie is a little entertaining and funny, but no more.

Yes, the story is somewhat simplistic, but so what? A simple, straight- forward story isn't a cinematic blunder in and of itself and doesn't mean that a film is ""dumb""and therefore unworthy of serious attention. The producers were aiming at an international audience, which meant that there wasn't much room for subtly and nuance, and frankly I rather like the idea that people in East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Latin America and Anglo- America could relate to such a film. Characterization was rather shallow, but the film's pace was fast and held my attention throughout. The film has some resemblance to steampunk in that the Chinese defenders of the Great Wall use complex machines that owe nothing to twentieth century technology, and this in itself is a fascinating aspect of the movie.So far, the film's American box office has been pretty tepid. I want it to have a much better reception in the United States, if only so that I can look forward to more films like this. See this film! If you have any interest in fantasy/adventure cinema, see this film and encourage all your friends and acquaintances to do likewise!",The Great Wall

He's willing to take the risks to try something different. To reshape the mold he's been cast in these past few years. I've always enjoyed him as an Actor and always will.I personally felt that for a European he sounded far too American, not over powering but for his own good and should he continue down the path of the Warrior, I hope he studies Voice Acting a little more and at the very least learns to neutralize his accent.I'm a big fan of Asian movies and experiencing one of the many legends that goes along with China was a pleasure to behold. My only downside to the movie is that I'm not a huge fan of the overuse of CGI. I get that they can't exactly film on the great wall but if there had been more physical realistic sets and less CGI, the movie might have been somewhat better.It was also a pleasure to see more of ""Pedro Pascal"", I adored his Character in ""Game of Thrones"" and it's good to see him on the big screen. While I found parts of his acting a little choppy, Matt Damon wasn't too much better. What was amazing was their seemingly natural chemistry and a show of friendship that can't be faked too easily.Watch this movie if you're a fan of one or both of the lead Male Actors.Watch this movie if you are a fan of Matt Damon and want to see him spread his wings into a new role and a new area.",The Great Wall

Rather than a real review, I'm just going to share some thoughts about it. 
'Hero' was one of my favorite movies ever; I loved the Chinese and Ukrainian forest scenes in 'House of Flying Daggers;' 'Curse of the Golden Flower' was fairly entertaining, though it was hard to square the fluorescent illuminated hot pink and neon-colored plastic columns with a palace in 928 A.D. 
So, liking the director's other movies and the actors, I wanted to enjoy it .... but then came the flood of CGI monsters. (Maybe it's a girl thing?) but -just like in LOTR, the Twin Towers, my eyes glazed over a minute into the sight of 200,000 identically rendered grey, ugly monster animal thingies swarming the set. I cease to care. Wake me when 90% of them are dead, and there's a good sword fight, or some dialog. That occurred about the time Matt Damon chose to free Oberon instead of grabbing the black powder, but not before some of those ghastly-colored plastic interiors from COTGF made an appearance. It might be one of those movies that grows on a person over time, during the rounds of late-night cableTV.

You are amazing./ A: No!! you are really amazing./ B: Don't say that, you are really really amazing./ and it kinda mixed with loads of heroic Chinese music.. It was kinda annoying. I mean really annoying. I know it wasn't about the US, but it really looked like China (by having stars from Hollywood) was just trying to say yay! We are both great! It smelled exactly like Dragon Blade (2015), but of course funner. You can see it in the movie that after each technology that China is showing, they use a Chinese heroic song and then in one shot, Damon and Pascal are awing that, then next thing, and then the same awing. Even if they wanted to have foreigners in the story, China had more interactions with its neighbors, not Europeans. Anyway, Matt Damon, suddenly became another person with loyalty (why? they didn't develop it that much. It seems he was impressed by the woman or the Chinese technology, which they wanted to steal, or Chinese bravery, which is not logical, because they practically were bad-asses), and the man and woman even didn't kiss!

332,ctimmons-20908,"Some enjoyable action, but not much else...",5,24 May 2021,"Based upon the genre, cast and director, this movie seemed like it would be right up my alley. However, it suffers from numerous issues outside of the otherwise enjoyable action scenes.Regarding casting, Dafoe was utterly wasted in his role, while Damon and Pascal just seemed like awkward choices. As others have said, those two had no real chemistry and their whole storyline felt very forced. Nothing against any of them as actors, I actually like all three a lot, just not in this movie. In fact, I think lesser known actors would've been much better suited for these roles as the focus isn't really on any of these characters anyway. However, for obvious reasons, their star power was clearly used to boost the movie (I fell for it, but it didn't pay off for me).Again, the whole Damon/Pascal storyline seemed unnecessary, I literally did not care what happened with Pascal's character, not to mention Dafoe's either. If the movie had focused more on the characters within the Nameless Order and their history, it could've been more enjoyable. I'm not saying the whole westerner storyline should have been abandoned, it just wasn't incorporated in a way that made me care about any of the characters. Even Damon's character was very uninteresting (and what was that accent even?).Which brings me to the next issue. There was too much going on with a 90 min run (credits rolled at right about 90 mins). Scenes seemed to jumped all over the place without any coherence. I wouldn't say I was ever lost as the plot is pretty straightforward, but a lot of the time I was thinking ""why did I need to see this particular scene, but wasn't shown other?"" (E.g., when the balloon attack fails we're simply told that it failed... seems like that would've been a cool/relevant scene). Instead, we're shown Pascal/Dafoe riding around in the desert and being totally irrelevant.Overall, the cons outweigh the pros for me, but at least it wasn't a 2+ hour letdown. The relatively short movie contained just enough enjoyable moments to make me feel like I didn't totally waste my time.",The Great Wall

It's beautiful, really beautiful to see. The armies are fantastic. Jing Tian is great on her role. All the battles are really well done but the plot is quite weak and leaves you thinking why they did that.
The ending could have been better.. they tried to do something that wasn't the obvious and they failed for me.

This is not an academy award winner, but it's still a lot of fun to watch. The visual effects are cheesy, but beautiful, and the same can be said about everything in this film. The plot is simple, and it's great to just hear a story be told, without trying to connect it to several other films within the same universe, or a band of sequel. It's just a simple, cliché movie with some good performances. It's entertaining, not too complex, and overall just very interesting. If you rarely watch movies, watch La La Land or Kong: Skull Island instead. If you are an avid moviegoer, however, or are just looking for a light viewing, I cannot recommend this one enough!

Hut seen on a very large 3D screen I fund it surprising and captivating. It's a fantasy (and why not?)set centuries ago atop China's Great Wall where an army, aided by a couple of Western interlopers using some elaborate weapons and strategies defends the country from invasion by a horde of fierce monsters.Zhang Yimou creates exquisite visuals of the landscapes and vertiginous views from the walls heights.Best of all is that you can actually see and understand what is going on in all the action set pieces. Unlike the furious mess of chopped up pixels that passes for 'action' in most Western fantasy epics (which somebody recently said is like somebody opening the lid of a whirring blender and aiming it at your face), in this film you have clear and involving view of the imaginative action.I hope people will give this a go and not be scared to see something not part of a 'franchise'.",The Great Wall

Even if the story background is interesting, the actors, especially the Asians ones, are terrible. They lack of deepness and you don't feel attached to them. It's probably a cultural thing but I don't watch movies with Asians usually. The only character who really worth it is Matt Damon. And I have to admit that I felt sorry to see him playing in that movie after ""The Martians"". Honestly, if you remove him from the casting, the movie is not watchable. Another aspect is the redundancy of the battles with the monsters. The story was pretty good until the monsters appears. After the first battle it was kind of redundant and kind of boring. In conclusion, it's another block buster with close combats and Kung-Fu scenes with super heroes. In a word, not very original.",The Great Wall

It's definitely better than Underworld that got 6.4. It's more in line with Passengers.Btw, I think that Rogue One should have gotten better than it's current 8.1.

350,ilikecheese82,An Entertaining and Misunderstood film.,8,3 June 2019,"Great action, brilliant visuals, scary monster hordes and all the best aspects of humanity that cinema can show us on the big screen.Many critics who haven't made an effort to absorb chinese/japanese/asian media in general, in regards to how they incorporate non-asian characters and cultures into their movies, books, comics and tv shows, will have elements of this film fly completely over their heads, and will see the film in a much worse light for it.Asian culture in general places a big emphasis on stereotypes, its a simplistic but useful way of them viewing and understanding the world when the vast majority of them are too poor to ever travel and see other cultures outside of media or working/study visas. The plot of this film and the introduction of the european characters into a chinese medieval setting is an intentional choice that creates both stimulating conflict and variety in perspectives and behavior of the characters.This film is not historically accurate in any way and it's not meant to be, it's a character piece, except the 2 characters not on the casting list is Asian Identity and Philosophies and European Identity and Philosophies, and how they conflict and complement each other. The unified, loyal, dedicated workers and soldiers of the chinese armies and their endless pursuit of perfection and playing to their strengths over the individualistic, chaotic and when it matters, deeply innovative problem solving aspects of the European characters are valid and appreciated stereotypes that plays to the Asian audience, this film was made for Chinese and east Asian audiences first, with quality western actors and an English script to bring western audiences into THEIR world, not the other way around.anyone seeing Matt Damon or the Europeans as stand alone characters doesn't understand the point of the film, they have personalities of course, but their racial heritage and identity are what shaped them, and the same for the Chinese cast. I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the film as a white male who enjoys all forms of media, and the action and CGI were top-notch for its time, a pity there hasn't been any movies like this since.I also appreciated the potential love-plot being ended and cut off, it's not something every film needs to be good, especially when the two main characters are not of the same race, it would have undermined the whole damn point of the story and why the humans even won, that our differences and what makes us unique are what makes us special and better suited to surviving whatever the universe throws at us, Matt Damon 'unifying' and race mixing with the female general ruins that concept and achieves the exact opposite.",The Great Wall

Lets start with the good part, some of the scenes are visually quite breathtaking. Zhang Yimou knows how to create impressive mass scenes with hundreds of extras, extraordinary camera movements and some cool CGI. And thats about all the positive things I can think of.So why is this film not working? Cause exactly everything in this film except the stuff I just mentioned above is ABSOLUTELY RIDICOULOUS. Yes, I cant think of a better word to describe this film. In fact it should be in the title. Matt Damon has a stupid fake Irish accent. The four legged monsters are super intelligent war strategists who pull back and regroup before attacking again and create diversions. For no reason explained the monsters loose their power when coming close to a magnet. The inventions and weapons the Chinese have are quite laughable, like the air balloons they fly with in the end or the giant scissors coming out of the wall.On top of all this ridiculousness the two main characters are both very wooden and lacks both depth and chemistry. The dialog is beyond stupid where the characters in many scenes just describe exactly what we see happening on the screen.

Though Defoe had only a small background character, his helped with the history of the army, and the wall. He was held there for years, and now had way out. William fighting alongside the warriors, over time, was won over by their loyalty, honor, and why they fight. The creatures Queen was interesting in how she would command them, and she had a group of other creatures solely too shield her. The Crane troup was my favorite, in their acrobatic, yet graceful diving into the creatures, too be pulled right back up.

It made perfect sense for his part in the film and the mix of English and sub titles was perfectly acceptable. I loved the drummers, the battle scenes, and the relationship that grew between William (Matt Damon) and General Lin Mae (Tian Jing) was perfect for the story line.

They look like they just came from the shop, or the washing-machine in the laundry- room....Not a single spot on them, everything looks brand new. Does that sounds realistic to anybody? All soldiers, or characters in the movie/series that have all brand new clothes on? I think not. To mention some other examples, then think of the colorful blue clothes in ""American Odyssey""...All perfectly without any spot or dent, or small holes etc. in the clothes, but the most perfect mint condition, and the bluest color like the Greek Ocean....

To me, this is a Zhang Yimou film through and through. Since his earliest films Judou, Raise the Red Lantern, and later Hero, Yimou's lens has always been fascinated by the mechanics of how things function (imperial society, bureaucracy, the army) which this film delivers again and again and again. The real star here is the mechanics of how the Nameless Order, The Wall and the beasts known as Tao Tei function. Not a single detail goes unnoticed. Striking flints are found in giant stone wheel wells on the arms of archers, Tao Tei return to collect their dead upon retreat, the wall itself hides a manpower machine of turning wheels, hidden weapons, and multiple stories of infrastructure. It's a beautiful reality based fantasy that takes things to ridiculous extremes. There is nothing that elicits more pure joy than the primary color coded army; among their ranks a squad of hot lady dragoons who bungee jump from a perch upon high into the fray brandishing Final Fantasy length lances. What the filmmakers have conjured here is pure myth but grounded just enough in the real history of the world with a deliciously Chinese backstory and more than its fair share of spectacle that borders on steampunk.",The Great Wall

378,witchcraft-starofall,Better than reviews,8,10 January 2017,I honestly do not understand why are people so upset that this film stars a White man and it is not what they expected. The film clearly stated that this is one of the legend regarding the Great Wall and I think that the director and scriptwriter have the rights to tell the story they want to. If you watch the movie carefully you should know that there are many characters in the movies which are heroes too and how much they sacrificed for their country. I feel Matt Damon's appearance is essential as he fought many wars and have the experiences to combat battles. All of the Chinese warriors were trained since young to fight that battle and there is a limit to their creativity and battle skills. However I feel that Andy Lau is not portrayed wise enough for his character. I think that all he did in the film is mention that magnets disrupt the signal/waves of the monsters which is what he read from the ancient notes.,The Great Wall

This being said, after about 3-4k+ movies seen so far, being an avid Damon fan and a consumer of sci-fi movies, I only made it trough the first 15 minutes of the movie. My brain simple couldn't go any further . Yes... the CGI is well done but ...there is nothing to back it ... After 15 minutes I was still wondering when the story will start or what is going on in the movie .... I felt like i was dropped in a mindless whirlwind of special effects and colors. I know that there are cultural and cinematographic difference between the Chinese, American and European filmography but this movie went to far. I've seen dozen of Chinese movies and always it was the story that made me watch them. But this movie had no story. At least not in the beginning, or if it had one the expectations related to the target public must have been set so low (IQ wise) I don't care if Matt and the others got a fat paycheck to star in this( it's their job and they got to make a living), but this movie was the first in a long long time I could't watch ( and I endured trough a lot of lousy movies).

386,spoupuce,A failed attempt at BeijingWood,4,17 March 2017,"I usually like Zhang Yimou as a director, and his action movies are good, so long as they stick to historical facts.

They have enough of it for thousands of movies without ever telling twice the same story. But « The great wall » is a poor attempt at trying to blend East and West, Mystique and reality, Legend and history, and indeed to make a buck on both side of the Pacific. And unfortunately it failed on all accounts. I know, I get it, it's a legend, but it's just too far fetch to enjoy it. This would have been better if they had been attacked by hordes of Zombies, or Orcs from Mordor, instead of those poorly made CGI creation that doesn't scare you one bit. Great costumes, some amazing scenery, a few funny dialogues just cannot replace a great story. The relationship between Matt Damond and Pedro Pascal was the best part of the movie and they had a few funny lines together. A people that was able to build the Great wall of China MUST be able to come up with something better than that. Don't try to copy the West, just be yourself.

Firstly, the characters of some roles is rigid and vague. Forever, just as in other films, the soldiers are brave and the generals are loyal, and people who were born for money learn at last take the responsibility and believe in something great. But we are already tired of this kind of roles and we need to see some personalities in them. Secondly, some parts of plot in this film are funny. When Pedro waved the red cloth and helped Matt kill a monster, it is awkward and makes me want to laugh because it is not suitable for the atmosphere of the film. All in all, the film is mediocre, in addition to the grand scene.",The Great Wall
393,jonowilson-97360,Saw this last night at a cinema in Shanghai,5,15 December 2016,"The latest Zhang Yimou flick is definitely a 'leave your brains back at home' type of adventure. Rather than serving as a work of art, like Mr Zhang's other works, it's purpose is to bank as much as possible with it's predictable story-line and overstuffed cast of big names who aren't used to their full potential. There are too many characters that aren't explored and are therefore pointless. The majority of the scenes are given to Damon and Jing Tian's clichéd 'will they, will they not-potential lovers' character arcs. In fact a good 25% of the film seems to focus on Jing Tian's face. The dialogue seems to have been cut from a large block of cheese and didn't do the actors any favours. For instance, Jing Tian's English lines were facepalm worthy and I spent a good portion of the film having a giggle whenever she spoke. Her delivery made them even worse.The foreign actors; Damon, Pascal, and Dafoe were doing what they could with the sub-par script and at times it felt awkward. For instance, the opening scene with Damon and Pascal. Damon spends a lot of the film doing his Jason Bourne face and speaking silly dialogue. His talent is wasted here and he only serves as the necessary 'Ooo look who's in this!' bankable star for the film. However, Andy Lau was more fluid and interesting as the cool-headed military adviser.The translations weren't accurate either. For example, when the functions of the different legions of the army on the wall were listed, the English subtitles named them by the colour of the soldier's armour whilst the Chinese dialogue named them by the animals their armour was based on. This leads me onto the lore of the film which should have been explored further. We don't really discover why the monsters have to attack every 60 years (Why not every 43 or 27 years?) and there is no real explanation for why the legions wear colourful animal themed suits of armour other than for their different roles in battle and the director's stylish purpose. Saying that, the costumes were brilliant. Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe deserves an award. The visuals and battle scenes are the only reasons to see this film. You can definitely tell you are watching a Zhang Yimou pic with the law of physics defying chunks of action. The monstrous demons taken out of Chinese mythology known as the 'Taotei' are well animated and make great villains while bringing a large amount of violence and terror to the screen (Definitely not for young children or those who are spooked easily). The scenes where the monsters are piling up against the wall are very reminiscent of World War Z. I'm sure this is done as a nod to one of the movie's many writers, Max Brooks. The film is full to the brim on visual spectacle, but lacks substance in pretty much everything else. Either go to the cinema and enjoy it for the visuals and effects or don't and do something more productive with your time. Could have been a lot better.",The Great Wall

Wow this monster has a new face now & ew it was creepy! 
Movie itself was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. Has many of the newer Chinese actors that I like and it didn't bother me at all having Matt Damon as a Western mercenary as the lead-teaching him Eastern ideas, philosophies and reasonings. I did want more character development though 
Visually the action scenes were stunning. Really liked the contrast of the different colors based on their military roles. Costuming is listerally brilliant. I was disappointed with how the end was rushed & then the movie was over just like that.

405,meigangwen,"Armed with ILM VFX, Matt Damon and Hollywood production team, a bad movie is still bad",1,19 January 2017,"I am giving ""The Great Wall"" a low rating not because I am angry about the story of a white man saving the world. I am reviewing it as a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie solely based on its entertainment value. Even with this mindset, this movie is still a catastrophic failure. Before I start talking about what failed, let us first take a look at what worked for this movie. I feel that the plot has no major flaw, the VFX is amazing as expected, the 3 white actors' performance are convincing, the set and costumes are well designed. So what really went wrong with it? In short, the main actress did a terrible job playing her role. Secondly, a great many of the supporting roles seem to be redundant.Jing Tian - The main actress did such a terrible job playing a female general who was supposed to have grown up in an army and had trained her entire life for the war. But she failed to display a least trace of real toughness or tenacity, which logically speaking, this character must possess. She was merely struggling to be a ""someone you don't want to mess up with"" for the first 10 mins of her screen time. Then, in the next scene, she showed up looking like an innocent, naive school girl, who magically brain-washed Matt Damon's character to fight the war by just repeating the word ""trust"" over and over again. Her ridiculous performance will make you wonder - How the hell did she turn Matt Damon from a selfish mercenary into a hero to save the world? Mind control?Most of the supporting roles don't help to develop the story at all, they seem to be totally redundant. What annoyed me the most is that, except for Andy Law and another guy, the rest of the supporting roles are not even played by proper actors. Singers, members of teenage boy band, variety show stars, people with almost no acting experience appeared in this movie as supporting roles to get their fans into the cinema. The result is that most of the supporting characters feel like zombies. So as an audience, you don't care about their life and death, you don't feel anything when seeing one of them being eaten alive by a monster. Even for a Hollywood blockbuster film, you have to get the basics correct for it to be entertaining. The director - Zhang Yimou used to be a great story teller and an expert at picking the right actor for his character. Apparently, he was not doing his job in this one.",The Great Wall

This is the movie that you have to see in a theater: you need the big space, large screen & immersive sound system to truly get lost inside this 3D wonder. This film is, quite simply, a visual feast. Don't be distracted by the criticism about 'what's Matt Damon doing in this Chinese film?' Simple answer, he's proving that once again, he's an accomplished actor who's also an action star.Set in medieval China, along a section of the Great Wall, Damon's William and his trusted partner Tovar (Pedro Pascal) get caught up in helping defend an outpost after witnessing the Chinese army and their specialized divisions, fearlessly dive in to fight the marauding monsters hellbent on eating everyone.The movie critic inside you may question parts of the story line and wonder about motivation. But tried and true plot devices are used to move the story along without the use of long, slow exposition. And in truth, it's not needed. The viewer learns all that's needed to root for the characters to triumph.At the end, you'll walk out of the theater saying 'wow', 'exciting' and 'so amazing'!

Zhang Yimou attempts to present us with complex action set pieces, mysterious antagonists and balletic, choreographed fight sequences but unfortunately he misses the mark by a wide margin. The CGI for example appears to have been rendered in two minutes flat and when the production had run out of cash. It is reminiscent of the levels of CGI quality not seen since the original Power Rangers movie (not too good). The fight sequences are so over the top, one wonders why a person need carry out five front rolls and a back flip in order to dispatch an enemy when a simple thrust of a spear will do...it's difficult to find something to like. However, all is not lost. Matt Damon puts in a not too terrible performance (Strange quasi-British accent aside), neither does Tian Jing.

The transition between acts are well thought out (very Hollywood in a positive way), many good ideas in the design of battle sequence. But overall it feels a little bit rushed, I wish it would be 10 or 20 minutes longer for proper character building, and a demonstration of lives behind the Great Wall. For example, a recreation of the painting ""Along the river during the Qingming festival"" would be a dream come true.The visual is very satisfactory, my only complain is that the armors are too shiny, the battlefields are too clean to my taste.

The arch his character takes from thieving marauder to fearless warrior is something I haven't seen from him since ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999). It tells the story of some guy - aptly named Matt Damon (Played by Matt Damon) - who partners up with some Hispanic guy (Pedro Pascal) and some other white guy (Willem Defoe) and they end up fighting a bunch of monsters who try to mess with their wall that they built. The enormity of the production is ambitious and breathtaking, thanks in part to labor costs staying low because of all the Chinese extras in it. Damon explores his range with a mix of Scandinavian, Canadian, and Irish accents throughout the film. A sort of West meets East kind of thing. Matt Damon (played by Matt Damon) saves an entire group of people, who were once helpless from a never ending horde of monsters, by building a wall, and doing some other stuff too.

416,sdjz,An era of consumption and entertainment,6,22 December 2016,"This film has received much controversial arguments since the trailer came out. The release in China so far has received more than 86 Million US dollars box-office in a week and the projection will be 150 million US dollars in China. The comments from the viewers on internet are very divided into 2 extremes. 1 star or full 5 stars on Douban (equivalent level as Rotten tomato in China). The biggest discontent perhaps, is not from the fact that the Great Wall is a bad film but the disappointment. From ""Raise the Red Lantern ""to ""Hero""Zhang Yimou has established his leading position as a talented director in both artistic creation and commercial success: Three best foreign film Oscars nominations, a Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes and 177m US dollars box-office worldwide in 2004. The spotlight the Great Wall is under this time seems focus on Matt Damon, lack of true culture representation etc. But these arguments really stem from one important fact that this is film is a first-time true co-production attempt between China and US. Co-production has not been easy and made many jokes in the past such as adding unnecessary minor roles for Chinese actors for a script does not really need any Chinese content added, or abrupt ad implantation (Yili milk in Transformers 4). And it will not be easy. The undeniable fact is the rising demand from the second large film market in the globe and the market and content makers are trying to adapt and push the edge. The harder part is the audiences' criticism and tastes grow more sophisticated and diversifies too. Will they catch the audiences step? Will the audience be trained to adapt to super story series just like western super hero series that the more disappointment and harsh criticism rise but more box office follows?The Great Wall has so far, the highest production budget in Chinese film history and for a China and US co-production film. It seems no pressure of covering the cost of 150m US dollars from domestic and worldwide box-office if we do a rough formulation by three-times budget worth box-office cover the whole pipeline production and marketing etc.At least from this perspective,Zhang Yimou has been an excellent project manager on a budget on this scale cross countries.I spent about 7 dollars on my 3D ticket in a 4K Doby theater and I think for a standard commercial film with good VFS and OST plus Matt Damon, it is worth the money. If the investors get their moneys back, then we will be seeing the Great Wall 2, 3, 4, 5 because that's how the industry works.

Critics should not be allowed into this type of film as they don't seem to get that it is designed for people who enjoy adventure and spectacle. All they do is pick it apart wanting it to be something it isn't. Some films are made for pure enjoyment not for moral purposes. Go and rent this film, most people will surely enjoy the experience.

I can understand the acting and character relationship development could have been better but this is more like a action/ fantasy movie and less so for the touching family drama and for that the movie delivered every bit of my expectation. The excellence of cinematography is also worth noting. I personally find it a better movie than Rouge One and I have always been a big fan of Star War movies. If you like action/ fantasy movie you will at least find the two hours well entertained.

Being an 80's baby I'm lost in a regurgitated movie culture and it leaves me scratching my head thinking....Can anyone write something original these days? How many remakes have you seen in 15 years? Exactly! That's one of the main reasons I liked this movie. It's not perfect but it pushes a positive message (unlike the majority of movies in 2016...What a drought we've been in). The imagery, the setting, the action, the plot, the catharsis, and the climax...All the classic elements of good story telling are there. Also there is no weird/dark propaganda which makes it great for the family (kids being age appropriate). It's worth a watch trust me.

It made as much sense as it could and was gripping all the way through. Throughout the entire movie I was making sure I got every single line, showing just how much I didn't want to miss anything. At no point did I slightly phase out, the movie went strong all through out. This movie was neither too short nor too long and there was no part of the story where it was either rushed or stretched out. It was timed perfectly.Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal and Tian Jing were very engaging protagonists, all with good acting making this fiction story not one of those where it is so obviously not true. The other characters all had good roles as well and were helpful in this story, making all the more better as there were no pointless parts.

It's a fantasy movie, and a good one at that.The scenery is breathtaking, it looks amazing with great detail, on every little detail there is something to look at.The story is not in any way a masterpiece, or in any way something you'd remember. It's kinda cliché, so you should not watch this movie for it's story, rather than the scenery and the adventurous fun. For anyone angry at the main character being white: there is a decent reason for that, and also he is not the best character (after my opinion). The Chinese actors are good, (I do not know the language, so I would not know if the dialogue is corny or not) but for English viewers, it's good. Matt Damon does a decent job, and so does Pedro Pascal.If you have two hours, do watch this movie. There is no nudity, but death and blood, so be cautious.

Walls aren't there so that you can fight upon them. They are for keeping ... stuff out completely.And btw that secret doorway is just comic like.Another problem I do have is the paste of the movie. The protagonist from 0 to 100 suddenly gets attached to the Chinese people and the overrunning of the wall just gets skipped Completely.

After showed on Chinese Screen, The Great Wall has got unprecedented low Scores at Douban and Maoyan, the Chinese IMDb. However, it just rose up to a political level because it has the worst actress Tian Jing. Yesterday, People's Daily, the mouthpiece of central China, criticizing ""low scores of The Great Wall is damaging film industry maliciously."" And then Maoyan's marking system was prohibited. At the same time Douban and Maoyan were interviews by National Film Board. And producers hire online water armies want to redeem scores and comments. How ridiculous! It just happened in 2016!Zhang was one of the best Director of China. Yet, After 2008 Beijing Olympic he became spokesperson of official and now he is becoming subservient to the capital. Big occasion and stars throughout all the film. We cannot see what he was good at----depicting characters' inner world and a tight compact structure. What we have seen were just video effects and various of famous stars in China no matter the terrible of acting skill level. Tian Jing, one of the magic actress in China. Since starting her showbiz, she has played many worst movies and won third The Worst Actress at Douban. However, her cooperates is bigger than bigger: Jack Chen, Tom Hiddleston, Matt Damon. Kim Hee Seon only got a supporting role when cooperated with Tian Jing. And she will play Pacific Rim: Maelstrom and Kong: Skull Island. The ugly face and acting skill make many people disgust with her. Just because her background she filmed with top stars and now even let People's daily criticizing these negative evaluation. It is said she is mistress of a man whose last name is Ye, the descendant of Ye j-i-a-ny-i-n-g. Ye is the Co-founder of PRC. Ye's family is still one of most powerful families in China.Now it is film time. Director Zhang used huge-crowed strategy throughout the film like opening ceremony of Beijing Olympic. He created a film that Tian Jing succeed educated European hunter and defeat the monsters which make me think the film called ""TaoTie"" is better. Producers want to attract more international audiences' attention that named The Great Wall that is a blasphemy to The Great Wall.Good special effects should service to film rather than just show to audience: look! Chinese can also made good special effects! The divide of contents and special effects is a huge failure of this film. A magnificent Great Wall just dig through by monsters, man you are kidding me! Those awesome monsters just became foolish and stopped after matrix dead, which just like ignore audiences' IQ. Many people seen this film with feeling of Director Zhang, However, it just over-consumption our feeling to Director and Chinese Film Market.The film has many Chinese elements: Kongming Lantern, Chinese Armours and The Great Wall. Yet, there only exist isolated and two-dimensional elements. Characterization look like pale and straightforward, people just walk though for attract audiences.Finally, I am big fan of Matt Damon, but he is declining in status in my heart because of his accepted of this scripts and film.",The Great Wall

It has the proved formula of featuring well-known actors (from China and America in this case) against an exotic backdrop (ancient China plays well to both audiences) with expensive visual effects (150 million, the most expensive Chinese film to date although they seem to be escalating since Red Cliff), and directed by China's premier film maker (Zhang Yimou, well known in China and abroad), but it ultimately fails due to a lack of substance. I was disappointed on all levels, but mostly because it perpetuates the idea that audiences are won over with eye candy and familiar actors. Those can only take you so far.

But extremely wrongly in a pop movie to show a big war. The original story is good, but the script is too naive. In fact only Matt and Tian Jing are full characters. The others are all walk-on. But these walk-on are all acted by popular young star which will cost much but not suitable for these characters. The only reason for above is for ticket office. These young lovely boy stars could attract lots of young fans to watch movie. The movie has no reasonable characters and logic. ONLY has some young stars and computer visual techs stack together.

Young people think Zhang Yimou could take a better film than this presented one, but now Zhang is lost in mob scenes with few inner world of characters.In my opinion, the spirit in this film is far behind the mainstream value. This is a story tells about how Chinese fight with monsters with united strength, nobody cares himself or herself in ancient China. I'm sure that was true in previous China, which can't be accepted by young people nowadays. The young generation enjoys an art which can make people know everyone has weakness, self- examination in one film is needed. The Great Wall doesn't show this, but it's still a good film to let foreigners know how Chinese fight with aggressors in all ages, individualism is not allowed in wars.Fans of the super stars feed the box office, but the flatten characters make this film flopped.

452,canniboofficial,An easily misunderstood movie,9,10 January 2017,"I love the movie. If you haven't decided yet whether to watch it or not, well, it is a very entertaining popcorn flick with a LOT of monsters. Enjoyable to look at and pleasant to listen to.Here I just want to point out a few facts about the movie that many people might get wrong, mostly because of their preconceptions.Spoilers ahead.First, there are apparently some ""white savior"" moments in the movie, but there are also a lot of ""Chinese savior"" moments. So who saves whom doesn't really matter. The wall was miles long and there were hundreds of thousands of monsters, so Matt Damon shooting down three of them doesn't really make that much difference. The true contribution that he made in the movie was that he helped capture a monster alive with his whaling experience in Spain, which makes perfect sense because the other characters, living in inland areas, probably hadn't seen a whale in their life. People simply have different experiences and helping out each other is great.Second, the relationship between the male and female protagonists was not a romantic one. In the end, they became two soldiers who understood, admired and trusted each other. It is not a clichéd love story. So, the white guy did not get the Asian girl -- and there is nothing wrong if they did love each other.Third, the movie is very fast paced and full of details. Reserve your judgment when you think there is a plot hole or something like that. Have a happy discussion with others before rushing to an angry or condescending conclusion. For example, I noticed someone mentioned in his or her review, as an example to show how stupid the movie is, that the catapults could not move and yet could hit the target at different spots. The fact is the catapults could move and the movie spent one second showing you exactly that. Also, the Crane Corp, which I heard many people claimed to be useless, was actually practical and powerful in killing and distracting the monsters in that the only weak spots of the monsters were the eyes, which were difficult to aim at from far away, and the monsters were much more dangerous horizontally than vertically.Last but not least, I'd like to talk about the message of the movie. Some people think the movie just wants to make money. Some think it is China's propaganda tool. While I believe there is some truth in both arguments, the movie can be interpreted from a much brighter perspective and is by no means meaningless. Actually the movie has so many meanings that it struggles a little bit to deliver all of them. Trust, greed, courage, sacrifice, and so on. Too many for the movie to have a definite and strong theme. One interesting interpretation I read is that the movie intends to convey that the US and China should work together to defeat terrorism, the core of which is an ideology whose iconic color is also green (like the queen of the monsters). My own understanding though is one simple message: what truly differentiates us is not race or culture, but what we believe and how we act. Not a wholly fresh idea but definitely a peaceful one, especially from a U.S.-China co-production.To put it in a nutshell, the movie is much smarter and much more considerate than many people think. I hope there will be sequels or prequels that can be even better.",The Great Wall

The chemistry between Matt and Pedro is great. The Chinese actors were good, they weren't supposed to speak perfect English. Their facial expressions were good and the directing is better than a lot of similar popcorn movies.The sound design rumbled the theater and in a fog fight scene, I felt like I was there with Matt and Pedro in the mist. SJWs complain about race, like they always do. They attack anything from China as the guardian always do, nothing new. They ask for ""character development"" because they want to sound smart.Since when did popcorn movies have a deep plot? You don't judge a pop song with classical standards. If you do, it means you don't know what you are talking about and you are trying to pass of as a pro. And why look at rotten tomatoes when the movie is not even out in the west? That proves they just want to troll. Good critics would never asks for historical accuracy in a popcorn fantasy. What they want is ""Shindler's list"" in Star wars costumes because they forget their age and Spielberg would never be so confused. This movie was made for a wide audience.Not just a specific group. Comic relief tells you to not take it so seriously. It was meant for pure visual and audio spectacle. As Zhang's Beijing Olympics opening. And Zhang did a great job with a script he didn't write. He and Ang Lee are two rare directors that can transition comfortably between east and west. All in all, I was entertained for almost two hours without boredom. In my theater no one got up to leave.

Maybe, if its made for TV-Series they have more time to develop any characters (even Game of Thrones, Vikings, Spartacus, etc didn't dwell too much on foot soldiers). If the weapons are quite ""out of this world"" - well, how did you think other films looks like. And don't forget, they invents a lot of thing back then over there. Give some slack for imagination & entertainment sake. If legend about the beast seems far fetched, lets rethink about other legends we've been fed all these times, eh.? Credit where, credits due.*By the way, me myself enjoy something more thought provoking kind of movies. But do enjoy any kind of ""hoo-hah"" or ""bang-bang"" presentation sometimes.",The Great Wall

Are you insane??! I'll enjoy Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and Star Wars because they're meant to be fantasies. The Great Wall is a joke - it seems as though the Korean film industry will continue to dominate the market on that side of the world. Also Matt Damon, really? You couldn't find any Chinese actors at all to play the lead? Imagine if an Asian actor was casted to play a norse god - or an Englishman was casted to play Shaka Zulu - see how ridiculous that would look? Exactly how I feel when I watch this.",The Great Wall
457,o-27508,Amazing visual display and acceptable level of clear plot,9,30 December 2016,"The Great Wall is truly a visual feast so would better to watch on 3D or IMAX. Some Chinese spectators have criticised its poor story and plot. However, I don't think it is necessary to design a rather complicated story as it has to tailor towards the audiences on the globe not just for Chinese preference that non-Chinese may be uninterested in ,or that may be difficult for them to understand. So non-Chinese audiences are able to capture at least the big picture of the whole story behind. This is a well trade-off for film makers, balancing the plot to an acceptable level for international audiences.I cant understand why so many Chinese ""audiences""(they did not even watch it before making comments) pretending to be international voters with broken English, are lopsidedly voting 1 and making negative comments here without any constructive and objective ideas.And even more ridiculous,they then go back to Chinese movie - grading website, with a screenshot of their own 1 star derogatory comments, misleadingly saying that foreigners also unlike the great wall as they do.Some even said this is a fake story. Come on haters, it is said at the beginning of the movie that this is based on one of the legend (a fairy tale) of The Great Wall.I don't think its a point to discuss it.Overall, I would award 9/10 the reminder 1/10 would be the length duration. It is exciting but too short. If it could extend to around 2 hours and add certain level of plot that would be awesome.Hope to see more Hollywood-style movies with Chinese historical and cultural elements in the future.",The Great Wall
458,v-74430,"Good movie, worth a look",7,8 January 2017,"Many Chinese film critics criticized the film and the audience, don't think he is showing the real Chinese culture, but I think the combination of Chinese and western film need to give the world the audience a common experience, rather than with ethnic, cultural issues, as long as good.Although the plot is simple, the film has some logical problems, supporting several performance is not very good, but the scene is the macro, the music is very grand, highlights the theme of the story tells us the unity。Some other problems, such as action design is drab, clothing is a bit too bright, the final decisive battle a bit simple. But still have a lot of advantages, there is no love story, the unique Chinese elements in Hollywood movies, to express the greed of human nature through the monster. Overall this is a worth going to the cinema to enjoy movies",The Great Wall

Monster fighting, good CGI, bombastic and fairly interesting, I enjoyed it.Don't know why so many terrible reviews are here with the reviewers never even having seen the film yet, LOL. Don't go expecting The Avengers (lol) or Schindler's List (haha), think more like Clash of the Titans, or World War Z.

Most commends are critical, but I still want to watch and evaluate by myself. At first, I am not very expected to this film, but I realize I am wrong after a while. It is amazing. I feel so exciting and nervous when the war starts. I feel moved at the end because so many soldiers lose their lives in order to protect their people behind them. The director wants to show the truth that we have to overcome not only the monster but greedy. In general, it is awesome! I have been watching a lot adventure and fantasy films produced by American directors. I cannot deny that they did better in producing this kind of film than Chinese directors. I am not racialism, so do not judge me. But now, I saw a great film produced by Chinese director which can stand shoulder by shoulder with those produced by American directors. I do not understand why so many people judge this film even though they do not watch it. It is so ridiculous! Some people may say ""white hero again"", but I think that ""the hero"" is not any single person. Every soldiers who sacrificed from resisting monsters is hero. Some people may criticize the poor plot, but I find many details are based on historical records accurately. For example, a detail run through the film is that mercenary look for gun power. Based on the the capital city was Bianliang, it must be Northern Song Dynasty. It is true that gun power has not spread to the west at that time. This film is the best film which combine Chinese elements very well. It is Yimou Zhang's first directed the true sense of the Hollywood blockbuster. It is a corn-stone in Chinese film history.",The Great Wall
461,yangyun-49715,Wooden acting,1,1 January 2017,"There is no sense of buildup in the story at all, and at the climax the acting is wooden, just a pair of characters grinning stupidly into space with no emotion for each other at all. Compare this with 'Lord of the Rings' where the mass battle scene appeared only after hours of buildup. The scene where the horse riders first encountered the Great Wall was very abrupt. I can't believe a bigname director could surprise us like this. Within seconds there is a transition from the desert chase to a circle of arrows out of nowhere. The number of identical monsters was ludicrous overkill, just part of the boring mechanical mood of the entire film. The budget could've been better spent on anime characters with more emotion than Matt Damon.",The Great Wall
462,frenchfries-48255,"Very good action movie, a legendary story in China",9,1 January 2017,"First，it is a Hollywood action movie with visual feast and with new Chinese elements. The plot is intense without any relax from begin to end, caught my attention all through the whole movie. The scenes and the pictures are magnificent and beautiful. My two boys one is ten and one is 17 both enjoy this movie a lot, because it features advanced film tech, armies in attractive and colorful dresses, varieties of weapons, the close distance fighting between men and the animal is really breathtaking although it it is tooshort. All these make it worth to go watch IMax. This is an action movie of a legendary story, it is very good entertainment.Secondly, the value it promotes is positive: trust and collectivism. It showed the braveness and royalty of ancient Chinese solders, and individualism vs. collectivism is well demonstrated in the film.Thirdly, the movie in China mainland has received controversial comments from critics, and the controversy are more on the related matters rather than on the movie watching feedback. For example, they criticized the selection of the Chinese actors, the big investment of the film, that the director Zhang should follow his traditional style, and that his strength in managing and producing huge scale scenes and people, and his artistic skills in making very beautiful pictures became sources of criticism. However, the consumers in China that actually walked into theatre to watch the movie gave fair ratings. On the biggest online ticket platform (Wechat's platform), the movie received a 8.5 out of 10 from more than 150,000 people, and has similar rating around 8.5 at other similar professional online ticket platform. So if you like action movie, it really worth to spend the money. I took one point off from 10 is because the movie is 100 min, it is too short. I think the suitable length is 120 min +. The close distance fighting with the animal can be longer and more, and some plot can be deeper and slower. The overall pace of the plot is really fast without any relax.",The Great Wall

Pull out some more of your crazy dragon legends too! Dragons are good! You could really capture children of all ages with a few great dragon movies. Magic and mystery would be awesome. Also...since you dudes came from the east to see Jesus a long long time ago...you need to make the whole Bethlahem and Jesus's Birth as well as your wise magi's coming to see Jesus after he was a bit bigger...just like the bible says...I know you all is socialist and communist and all...but I also know like over half of your population are true Christian brothers and sisters who know Jesus Christ personally and you all would do a great job at making a truly Biblical movie...call it the Adventures of Jesus Christ or something.",The Great Wall

Some of the photography was good, but even that was ruined by using the same locations over from different angles, well that is how it seemed to me, I could be wrong. The film was ruined by the silly plot and the fact that it was written for idiots. It started OK, then quickly decayed. Everyone dressed up in stupid colored costumes, unbelievable monsters that no one could kill, no real defense planned. I went without any checking on the reviews as I saw Matt Damon's name as the lead and his films are usually good. Will check first next time.",The Great Wall

Nice scenery, nice effects and a somehow good back story to get you hyped about whats coming!Everything was OK until Matt Damon fought the 1st monster in the movie! The fight was absolutely ridiculous! A whole freaking army couldn't kill 1-2 of them with heavy catapults (that by the way were adjustment to the same spot with no ability to move whatsoever, but were shooting in various angles in the whole movie with 100% accuracy), but our ""Hero"" saves the day with 1 arrow each time (Instakilling each enemy) The movie goes on with the army failing hard and our main hero continuously one shooting what ever he has encountered like he's cheating! Some random deaths to make you feel sad? And ofc the Lady falls in love with the hero!The Monsters dig a tunnel in another part of the wall and proceed to the main city!! And So we get hot balloons out of nowhere so our main heroes can go to chase the monsters! Our heroes then proceed to kill the main ""boss"" of the movie and blah blah blah you have seen it 100000 times before!The Good part in my opinion was that I had a laugh for the 3/4 of the movie, I liked a lot the costumes and some of the ideas they had for the wall and the war machines, the CGI was good at the start, but I felt that as the movie went on,it got worse and worse and overall I felt that the hole movie (plot,CGI wise) was getting worst us it progressed!",The Great Wall

Otherwise, this film is an insult to intelligence, a defiance to logic, which it has none, and a massive waste of time. I would not watch it even if I get paid. If someone makes me watch it twice, I would call it a torture. Astonishingly awful movie given the amount of money the producer spent in producing it.

A conventional fight sequence showcasing the ancient strategies and weapons which were depicted with some really nice effects. And the outfit of characters are pretty detailed and thought over. The characters are built by their present not their past.One thing over which this movie lacked is creating suspense among the audience although it tried, but the story went with a nice pace in a conventional style.

473,linneaschoberd,I didn't expect much...,4,25 February 2017,"""The Great Wall"" is a movie about one of the legends of the Great Wall of China. After I've seen the trailer I was curious but I didn't expect much. And this was a good thing to do. I wasn't satisfied at all. The story was scattered, chaotic and made up out of thin air. Yes, it is a myth but still, the story didn't work out at all. I saw it in 3D and there are also some things to criticise. The 3D effect wasn't that good. In fast fighting scenes, the contours were blurry and in the normal scenes you could take off your glasses without seeing a difference. There we come to the next point. The CGI. The beasts were authentically animated, but they did look animated in faster scenes. It wasn't bad but you could do it better. The thing that really did annoy me was how the backgrounds, especially in the desert scenes, looked like. It was such a horribly obvious green screen, it nearly caused physical pain to me.As a conclusion, the film is for people who like to see action and don't want to have too much plot.

I do not feel bored for a second over the entire film. I have watched too many movies, but this one is different and refreshing.Some criticize that the story line is not very reasonable. I do not agree. All can be well explained. For example, the five armies show variations and provide depth to the defense system. Critics say that Jing Tian's Crane Army is a suicide army, but it effectively serves as the Air Force. It is easier to hit the monster's eyes (underneath their arms) from above when they are climbing the wall.",The Great Wall

It was the Song dynasty when the summit of ancient science and technology in the history of China was achieved; and the monster Tao Tie came from a famous manuscript in 2000 years ago, which was depicted quite well with the help of modern technology.

It is mainly due to the Chinese cast speaking fast and the subtitles were right but doesn't really show the actual meanings in my perspective. That leads to all the complaining about the story being jumboed up and being frustrating for them. besides the first part where it explained the settings there really isn't much depth to it.

Some of the shots of the wall are cool but, this is ruined by the soldiers. They are dressed in these ugly costumes that make it look like a musical. These uniforms are the color of the rainbow and just make it look silly and stupid. I expected much more from this but could not even watch it because it was so poor. Even the CGI looks fake.

479,wenzhuochen,Fair review from a Chinese Canadian audience,6,23 February 2017,"Warning spoiler ahead.Aside from giving a fair review to the movie from my perspective, the aim for this review is to also decipher some of the questions regarding why ""The Great Wall"" have polar opposite reaction between some of the audience, mainly the Chinese audience. Given my familiarity with the Chinese entertainment & movie circle, I will give my 2 cents as to why I think the movie is great in some area and falls short in others.First, the movie was great because of the plot and the visual. Ever since the first time I saw the trailer in the movie theatre I was captivated by its plot. Historically the great wall was built to defend against the outside invaders as oppose to monsters in the movie. A great twist by combining famous land mark and monster in the fantasy world, this setting add a should of mystery surrounding ancient China that leads me for wanting for more. Throughout the film, great display of colours，stunning battle scene and realistic 3D effects with the building and monsters leaves me astonished. Now I would like to express some of the things that I think were not so great in the movie, mainly the development of the story & character and the connection to the wall.The plot was the reason why I wanted to see the movie in the first place, it is also the part of the movie that falls short on. The plot start it out great by introducing a legend about how well trained troops defend The Great Wall of China from monster, then comes along 2 western mercenaries skilled in combat helping them with the battle. However, as the story continues it felt the Chinese troops would've been fine going against the monster by utilizing their black powder arsenal even without the main protagonist by their side. Perhaps a disturb in balance between the number of monster vs. troops would've add to the story and the significance of the main protagonist. Also the main protagonist is overly glorified as this godsend character, there wasn't really a fist clenching moment when I feel that the main character is in a pinch. The movie depicts each individual monster as these intelligent creatures that are constantly learning and evolving, capable of helping other monsters in need, devising attack plan on a macro level by following queen's order as well as taking out key figures such as the general using sneak attack by themselves, however judging by how the main character were able to kill the queen, there is a huge discrepancy in monsters' intelligent. So overall the character development was too simple and poor, the conclusion was rushed and not well thought out.The main selling point of the movie revolves around defending monsters from beyond The Great Wall, but the wall became less relevant as the story unfolds, especially towards the end. The Great Wall's only purpose was to draw the audience in and dumped aside as the plot no longer needs it. It feels to me if the director had switch the wall to some other places, the story would've been the same. The title The Great Wall lost its significance, the connection between the story and the title is weak. Now to answer why some Chinese audience rated the film so low on the scale from my point of view is because of the following reasons:Number 1: The film is directed by director Yimou Zhang, he is also the director for many well known international movies (just to name a few film that have been awarded, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, The Flowers of War etc...). He has worked with many internationally renowned actor such as Christian Bale, Jet Li, Ziyi Zhang etc... local critiques rated many of his film to be master piece. Thus the Hype and expectation was really high.Number 2: Many famous Chinese film stars and celebrities made an appearance in the film. Suspected motives were to attract Chinese investors and local audience by using big name stars. Therefore many fan of the stars were excited to see their star appear on a international screen.A film directed by a very renown director with many award winning titles under its belt in combination with many famous film stars, the film was advertise adamantly to be an international level film for the global audience. Yet the film falls short on many levels, many people were probably angry and disappointed, thus the 1 star and lashing out on the comment section on many film websites.",The Great Wall

There were so many colours, it was like I was on crack again, such a masterpiece. The original cast would be so proud of there Chinese counterparts. However, my only complaint is that matt Damon wasn't a true black power ranger, so the nostalgia didn't feel as real, but Maybe that's a good thing. If he was a black actor he probably would have died in the first 5 minutes by being crushed by the megazord in a last stand moment.

483,chenalexis,Dragon or Alien,3,25 February 2017,"Not sure if Matt Damon knows what he was taping in this film. In Asia they called the creature who they were fighting, a monster, beast, creature. But when Mr Damon was promoting this film in the US he uses the word, ""Dragon."" In any case, I call it the alien who they were fighting. I think the main failure to this film is too much action, too much CGI, not enough depth in the plot. Action movies are great to attract audience who are not so good in the language the movies are speaking in. By using action to express current situation help audience, who doesn't speak the language, more involved into the movie. However, in the movie Great Wall, which was clearly targeting the two main market (Chinese and American) were using two languages. Chinese don't really need to know a lot of English or Americans don't really need to know Chinese language to understand the whole story. Therefore, the actions use in the movie really don't speak to the audience what the characters are saying or feel in the movie.",The Great Wall

It is based on nothing, the legend of the beasts which attacks once in 60 years is childish, as well as the entire ceremony of Chinese soldiers uniforms and organization. Without stars as Matt Damon or Pedro Pascal (Narcos, Game of Thrones), the film would be less than a television production. It is without intrigue but with lots of effects, the characters have no real solidity and a story with a huge potential was wasted through this screening... Its main problem is that even the Great Chinese Wall should really be involved into the great cinematography because of itself. Adding a foolish story to a monument like this is almost an heresy and my opinion is that the producers/Chinese authorities were sloppy in paying for such a product.",The Great Wall
494,amirbh-40192,This movie is a huge fun,8,14 October 2017,"Surprisingly better than I thought. I do appreciate it when movies use genuine languages and not simply having everybody speak English cause that's dumb. if your plot in China you better speak Chinese !! good work there guys. great effects and soundtrack ! The story itself is legend/fantasy which lets some scenes to be acceptable. Just as a comparison, having ""Toreto"" jump over a bridge after standing on his car's hood at 100 mph and land on a tank (Fast & Furious) is NOT acceptable, nor logical. A solid 8 there !",The Great Wall
495,cargash,"Its OK, Why the vitriol?",5,7 January 2018,"OK. It is not an Academy award winner. It does not aspire to be. It is a two hour-roller-coaster popcorn flick. Decent CGI, acceptable acting, OK props, OK story. This story won't stay with me as a memorable piece of art. But I enjoyed it for what ir is, and had a good time. Go in with that level of expectations and you wont be disappointed! Value for money.",The Great Wall
