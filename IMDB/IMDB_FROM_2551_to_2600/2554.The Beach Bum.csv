0,SnoopyStyle,Is this funny?,3,16 June 2019,"Writer Moondog (Matthew McConaughey) is the beach bum. He lives a hedonistic lifestyle in the Florida Keys. His wealthy wife Minnie (Isla Fisher) is busy with their daughter Heather (Stefania LaVie Owen)'s upcoming wedding. Their friend Lingerie (Snoop Dogg) has a special weed plant. After the wedding, Moondog gets into a car crash which kills Minnie. She leaves her fortune in Heather's control. After yet another drug rampage, Moondog is sentenced to twelve months in rehab where he meets fellow addict Flicker (Zac Efron).This movie leaves me with a lot of questions. Is this actually funny? Do I actually like Moondog? Do I actually care about Moondog? All too often the answers come back, ""No"". McConaughey is channeling his cool surfer dude persona. It's a good start but it stalls pretty quickly. None of it is pulling me in until Moondog gets dark for one second. He and Flicker stealing from the handicap guy is the first intriguing moment and then it quickly fades away. The shark attack isn't funny and is much too silly bordering on stupid. In the vein of Dumb & Dumber and Dude, Where's My Car?, Moondog needs to be fun and likeable to endear himself to the audience. The comedy would follow but it won't work if he doesn't work.",The Beach Bum
1,nogodnomasters,Is that all there is?,4,29 June 2019,"The film centers on author-poet Moondog who is an unemployed beach bum living in the Keys off of his wife's money. Her money allows him to drink, do drugs, have indiscriminate sex, and drink some more. When his wife dies, his money is cut off until he finishes his book.The film was rather pointless which seemed to be the point. Major stars lowered themselves to be in this film, apparently Harmony Korine calling in some favors. The character was anachronistic, attempting to make a Jack Kerouac type an 80's author.Guide: F-word, sex, plenty of topless nudity.",The Beach Bum
2,kosmasp,Fear and Loathing at the ... beach,7,8 June 2019,"Now I'm not comparing the movies or characters entirely here. But like with Fear and Loathing there does not seem a goal our hero/main character is trying to reach. Actually Beach Bum seems even less straighforward. And I guess some might call it sexist. It is quite in the world of or rather in the head of that one character - and Matthew has said in interviews he drew inspirations of people he had met in real life.So great acting, but kind of hard to really pin point, really make up our mind. Even another reviewer who rated it a bit higher than me was like ""I liked it (I think)"". And that really sums it up, because I too think I liked it, but it's just a fine line with the movie. It is quite easy to slide over to the ""I'm annoyed now"" side. So keep that in mind with a movie that defies a lot of things - and while it is comedy, it is not conventional in that regard either",The Beach Bum
3,Quinoa1984,"in a nutshell: full blown madness, dark/violent/nihilistic comic excess, and I liked it (I think)",8,8 April 2019,"How much you like or dislike this movie depends on how much you're into Matthew McConaughey and Harmony Korine making their Cheech and Chong/Hunter S Thompson flick (well, Thompson but as a poet and more The Dude than Raoul Duke).This is funky, loose, crazy, and dumb, but often wildly funny. I dont know if Korine is going for a terribly deep message, and thats ok! It veers into mania and real darkness and terror, and it is legitimately shocking because he's got his chops as a provocateur (in part because Debie, for all his filters, has a sense of naturalism alongside his director), but the whole experience is riveting. It's his most ""conventional"" movie in that it isn't aggressively full of oddities, but that doesn't mean it doesn't dance enough there to be what it is.I knew at times I shouldn't be laughing, or at least questioned it, and I think I can see someone coming to it and not having any of it. I wouldn't be mad if someone told me this got on their nerves - like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it'll either hit you or it won't. For me, I dug McConaughey (how much this is how he is deep down and how method or who knows what for it, don't care, I was equally charmed and repulsed and couldn't look away) and I dig seeing Martin Lawrence, as the world's greatest dolphin tour guide, make a quasi comeback in one of the more insane comic set pieces I've ever seen. It keeps you on your toes and doesn't let you know how to feel about the shenanigans go down.Soundtrack is an all-timer (give or tair a Creed song).",The Beach Bum
4,evanston_dad,Relentlessly Terrible,1,6 March 2020,"I'll be up front. I only watched the first 50 minutes of this relentlessly terrible movie. So I fully acknowledge that I have no right to a fully formed opinion of it.But it says something that I didn't finish this movie, as bailing on movies is a very rare occurrence for me. There have been plenty of movies I've WANTED to bail on, but the only other one that I can actually remember pulling the plug on was ""Crank,"" and that was tough since I have a major man crush on Jason Statham.I don't, however, have a man crush on Matthew McConaughey because....well....who could? He is. so. repulsive. His repulsiveness meter in this film goes to 11. And he's not just physically repulsive, though he is definitely that. The character he plays is just gross in every conceivable way. Everyone in the movie inexplicably finds him to be irresistible, women especially, who just can't turn down a dirty, bloated man with gum stuck in his hair and a penchant for wearing his wife's pink, fuzzy nightgowns. Why is he wearing his wife's nightgowns? I couldn't focus on that question, because I was too distracted by shot after shot of him spreading his legs at the camera, the thinnest expanse of fabric separating us from his junk. I was so afraid something might slip out and I wouldn't be able to unsee it.Director Harmony Korine thinks he's huh-larious. Not McConaughey, though I assume he thinks he's funny too. No, I mean himself. This movie I think is a paean to those who give their middle finger to the squares who are stuck following the normal conventions of society -- like bathing -- and who instead live life their own way. Of course the free soul in this stinker can't think of anything better to do with this life of freedom than be stoned literally all the time and wander around muttering.Why is McConaughey always macking on his own daughter?Why is Jonah Hill impersonating Tennessee Williams? And why is he wearing those pants?Why is anything the way it is in this movie?""The Beach Bum"" looks like it consists entirely of coverage shots left on the editing room floor. All of the scenes of people actually talking about things that matter and that might cohere into a reason for watching the movie are cut out, and we're left with montage after montage of drunk people being obnoxious.Who knows, maybe everything there is to enjoy about this movie happens in its last 40 minutes and the joke is on me. I will have to just find a way somehow to live with that possibility.I only watched this movie because some film critic, I forget who, put it on his ""best of year"" list. If I ever meet that critic, I am going to fling his press credentials to the floor in disdain and say haughtily, ""You sir, are no film critic."" That'll show him.This film is to be avoided like coronavirus.Grade: F",The Beach Bum
5,deloudelouvain,Not that great.,5,14 June 2019,A stoner movie with Matthew McConaughey and Snoop Dogg in the cast is just appealing. I'm a fan of Matthew McConaughey but I wouldn't say this was his best performance. It was okay but the story just was not that interesting. I don't know if the makers were looking for a The Big Lebowski-like movie but if so it's a failure. I actually wished I watched that movie over again for the twentieth time than watching The Beach Bum instead. There are a couple good passages where I laughed out loud but overall it's a bit weak and pointless. Good to see Snoop Dogg though...,The Beach Bum
6,blanbrn,Fun wild and free spirited movie of living life by one's own way and rules with freedom.,7,1 April 2019,"""The Beach Bum"" is one film as you watch you enjoy it's a carefree feel good time of just living out things doing pleasure and not having a care in the world. Set between Miami and Key West, Florida you the viewer really get in the mood with the music and it's nice to see musicians and see clips of the music video ""Key Largo"" by Bertie Higgins(plus the song is sung during the movie) so you know your treat is a beach movie.Now on to the lead character Moondog(a brash blunt turn from Matthew McConaughey) who's a cheap beer drinking weed smoking ladies man who loves the boat and sea. Also Moon has a socialite trophy sexy lingerie wearing wife named Minnie(Isla Fisher who's so sexy in that silk green bra and panties scene!). And the love making and sex scenes are raw and far out as this guy holds nothing back. Even rapper Snoop Dog has a role as a family friend.Aside from it all Dog does have some talent in the form of writing like poetry can you believe it! He wins in the end in his own way at his own cost. Overall good brash blunt pleasure film of freedom showing how one can live life their own way and have fun and enjoyment all these elements made this film a pleasure to watch.",The Beach Bum
7,FeastMode,pointless garbage,1,28 September 2019,I watched about 30 minutes of this movie. i immediately could tell it was awful. only watch if you want to build your boredom tolerance. (1 viewing 9/27/19),The Beach Bum
8,westsideschl,McConaughey At It Again,7,2 July 2019,"Wellll, could have given it a 9 because McConaughey showed his versatility w/an outrageous performance, and he's giving his bod up (again) for viewer critiquing. Background music was classic oldies of high appropriate caliber (Right Down the Line; Margaritaville; Sundown; Into the Mystic).
Lines to give you a sense of script include, ""I've done a bit of smuggling, and I've run my share of grass.""; ""I like boats, I like sunshine, I like beautiful women."" ""How's he different from people up north - the ones racing to their red light. Life's short, just have a good time."" ""You know what I like the most about being rich?

9,UniqueParticle,Mix of masterpiece & a mess!,9,10 April 2019,"I love how someone else said it's a middle movie without beginning or end -
that's a perfect description of everything you need to know. I saw this yesterday on $5 dollar Tuesday that some theaters near me seem to have, I enjoy making use of that quite often & it's great for the admission of something like this where it's basically a party all the way through.I like how there are people that hate or love this movie. Like most films I watch I enjoy more than most cause I'm an oddball. Anyway, this has brilliant writing, beautiful cinematography, the acting is decent, a bit silly at times, not much else to say - this isn't even one of those movies that can be spoiled just remember how it's a middle movie. They never explain how Moondog ended up the way he did - at least in my opinion it's more of a choice!I hope people at least give this a chance cause I think it's awesome!",The Beach Bum
10,eddie_baggins,A criminal waste of talent,2,10 February 2020,"If you've seen the trailers for The Beach Bum or anything that director Harmony Korine has made in the past (in what's been a very divisive career so far), it should come as no surprise that this Matthew McConaughey starring stoner ""comedy"" is likely to offend and bore most and absolutely rock the world of a few select viewers that find joy in watching McConaughey's poet Moondog traverse around the stunning water surrounds of Miami for 90 minutes.There's very little plot, narrative or seemingly point to Korine's newest dosage of neon tinged oddities as Moondog works on a new collection of life musings for publication, has to deal with relationship and fatherhood dramas that includes issues with his wife Minnie (an underutilised Isla Fisher), rehab with Zac Efron's Flicker and parties with Snoop Dogg's hip hop star Lingerie.You don't expect a Harmony Korine film to follow any particular rule book as the director has always ensured that his films are everything but ordinary but despite a great sense of visuals and McConaughey's no doubt method performance that seems like a riff of his real life persona, The Beach Bum fails to justify existence as we are treated to rambling scene after rambling scene that features far too much filler and time wasting to ever become the fever dream it so clearly wants to be.Similar in nature to classic gonzo drug addled trip Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Beach Bum clearly wants to throw us into the mindset of a woman loving, work hating, grass smoking ""genius"" but Korine struggles to make Moondog an actual likeable or fun figure and while McConaughey even at his worst point can be devilishly charming and engaging, he too can't save The Beach Bum from becoming nothing more than a trip to boredom with a lot of wasted talent at its disposal.Surrounding his leading man with talented performers of all shapes and sizes, that also includes bit parts by Martin Lawrence, Jonah Hill and Jimmy Buffett as Jimmy Buffett seemed like a sure fire win to make an enjoyable comedic yarn but Korine's inability to make us care for or like a single one of these characters makes you wish someone else could've made this story into a cohesive and interesting whole.Perhaps it was never the intent of Korine in the first place, as one character says to Moondog at a pivotal moment in the film, ""You know what I like the most about being rich? You can just be horrible to people and they just have to take it"" it feels almost as if Korine is suggesting the seemingly untalented Moondog is a representation of the filmmaker himself, able to make whatever film he feels like and we just have to endure it.Final Say -Despite some nice scenery and visual work, The Beach Bum is a criminal waste of a great cast and a potentially Big Lebowski like comedic yarn, The Beach Bum is a major disappointment for all involved and a misguided feature from a to self-assured filmmaker.1 dolphin tour out of 5",The Beach Bum
11,damianphelps,Possibly the most relaxed movie I have ever seen,4,27 September 2020,This is not an un-enjoyable movie but its not particularly good either. It meanders along providing the cast a chance to get high every single scene (and gives the impression of reality!)Nothing too much happens and the ending is kind of self indulgent.I didn't dislike watching it but if I never had that would have been ok as well.The only genuinely funny scene in the movie is when Lawrence goes swimming with dolphins.,The Beach Bum
12,subxerogravity,Is this suppose to be the sequel to the Big Lebowski?,7,29 March 2019,"Seriously! It's been A while since I've seen Big Lebowski, but didn't he have sex with a rich chick and then at the end of the movie Sam Elliot tells us that there might be a little Dude?Well according to The Beach Bum, the Dude who now looks like he should be selling Lincoln cars, semi settled down with that chick in order to watch little dude turn into a 22 year old woman( The timing is near perfect. When did Lebowski come out? 97 98?), and now the Dude is a wirter with one hot book that put him on the map and he becomes to burn out and lazy to pull off another( this part actually does sound like the Dude).Well at lease Harmony korine's version of the Dude, which overall is not as good as the Cohen Brothers verson. Props to the film for dishing out some great performances by ""actor"" Snoop Dogg, Jonah Hill, in a cameo appearance Martian Lawrence, in an overplayed cameo appearance, and Last and least Zac Efron.The movie seems like Korine is taking leftovers from Spring Breakers (now that's a cult classic) and trying to put it together to make this movie. Almost like one would put together a hot dog.It has its moments but overall it's just ok. If you're a fan of the oddity that is Harmony Korine, this will make you laugh out loud when it gets bizarre, other than that, waiting for those moments can bore you and make your mind wonder.",The Beach Bum
13,jadavix,"Strange art-stoner flick, but entertaining in fits",7,23 January 2020,"Hard to review a movie like ""The Beach Bum"". Sure, you can fault it fairly easily, but I'm not sure if those faults aren't intentional. And are they really faults in that case?Take for example the casting of Matthew McConaughey as the protagonist, a man named Moon Dog, the titular ""beach bum"" who probably doesn't have a single scene sober in the whole movie. He finances his nomadic, chemical-induced lifestyle through his prior success as a brilliant writer, and has a beautiful wife (played by Isla Fisher) who is also filthy rich and doesn't mind that he screws around on her.Of course, none of this is believable for a second, but when Moon Dog is nominated for a Pulitzer, and reads a ridiculous poem while clad in women's clothing, you can feel the tongue in the cheek and the elbow in the ribs.The movie also doesn't really have a story. It goes in one direction for a while, gets bored of that, goes in another direction, sees what happens there, etc. Of course, it's just like Moon Dog himself in that regard.The film has been generally typed as a stoner comedy, but it's never really laugh out loud funny. But again, I return to the central question of the movie: is it really supposed to be? There's one scene with Martin Lawrence and some alleged dolphins that did have me laughing out loud, so surprising was it.""The Beach Bum"" is worth going on a journey with, if you think you might be interested. It's an experience.",The Beach Bum
14,stevendbeard,"Sometimes Funny, Sometimes A Mess",5,31 March 2019,"I saw ""The Beach Bum"", starring Matthew McConaughey-White Boy Rick, Dazed and Confused; Snoop Dogg-Pitch Perfect 2, Training Day; Isla Fisher-Tag, Wedding Crashers and Stefania LaVie Owen-Krampus, The Lovely Bones.
They couldn't have gotten a better person to play the lead role in this movie than Matthew McConaughey-not that it's a good movie, because it's not-but the part fits him like a glove. Matthew plays a successful writer that doesn't really care about money. Isla, his wife, lives quite well off and Matt will visit her on occasion-like when his daughter, Stefania, is getting married-but they have an open relationship, with each of them having sexual relations with other people. Matt's favorite past time-besides writing-is drinking and smoking pot. In fact, he drinks and smokes while he is writing, which leads to lots of partying. When he has to enter a rehab program, he doesn't stay long-he escapes. Snoop plays his friend and co_smoker, as well as Isla's lover. The movie is a little off kilter; sometimes funny and other times just a mess. There are a few good cameos. I remember seeing Jimmy Buffet, Jonah Hill, Zac Efron and Martin Lawrence, with Martin Lawrence's being the best-he goes swimming with dolphins.
It's rated ""R"" for drug and alcohol use, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't recommend renting it, either-unless you are a big Matthew McConaughey fan, such as my wife is, and even she didn't care for it. If you want to see it, I'd wait until it's on cable.",The Beach Bum
15,CubsandCulture,A lot could be forgiven if the film was... you know... funny,5,23 June 2019,"I wasn't expecting this to be laugh out loud per se but as a stoner comedy at its core I was expecting something along the lines of The Big Lewbowski for humor. Parts of the film are very amusing; Efron, with his ridiculous yet somehow sexy hair/facial hair, is a bright spot. And the Flicker episode is the most engaging of the film. Moondog is the character McConaughey was born to play. The character is charming enough to be worth following for 90 minutes. But on the whole the film seems too mean spirited and sour to be really comedic.Everything else wrong with the film would have been tolerable without that main issue. The story is extremely unfocused and episodic. It is more a portraiture than anything else. Each section doesn't really build or lead into the next. (The timeline also jumps around at times) And yet they all sort of blur together because there is a lot of similar scenes (i.e. drinking) and the direction doesn't set them apart. This might be the point as it paints a picture of Moondog's life but that doesn't mean it is worth sitting through.This film needed another pass in the editing room or at the script level.",The Beach Bum
16,kwenchow,This is not a comedy film! Unless I lost my humor! Bored to freaking death!,1,12 June 2019,This movie is about the life of a depraved rich guy called Moondog! Entire film full of boring conversation! I think the only good thing is almost every partying scene have nudity girl! And full of negative example too! Moondog rob a disable guy at the street! He even escape from a rehab center! He also trafficking drug! He should rot in the prison or die at the end! But instead he been present an award at the end! Only one barely funny scene!

18,MissSimonetta,... Wow,7,3 January 2020,"You will either be delighted or bored and annoyed. It is essentially the adventures of a widowed stoner, living as he pleases rather than as others think he should.

20,rgkarim,Artistic Aimlessness That Will Appease Target Audience,5,30 March 2019,"You have those actors that draw people in right? These movies that utilize this card sometimes take the path last taken and offer a... unique twist to tell a story. Welcome to Robbie K's movie review, and tonight's movie utilized this tactic quite well in the form of Matthew McConaughey. Bringing the wild Lincoln showman to the screen, they hoped to take a very unique concept to the silver screen and wow us with a movie about drugs. What is in store? Well stick around to find out as I review:Movie: The Beach Bum 2019Director:
Harmony Korine
Writer:
Harmony Korine
Stars:
Matthew McConaughey, Snoop Dogg, Isla Fisher
LIKES:McConaughey can act stoned
Funny... at times
Less than 2 hours
Artistic Approach
Good Musical ScoreSUMMARY:As stated above, The Beach Bum is certainly an experience that tries to point out the ""fun"" life can have if you have power to get past illegal actions. The lead continues to show he can play a variety of roles, with a legitimate stoner role being added to his resume. Moon dog the carefree spirit was a very unique role and I think that McConaughey succeeded in the free spirit approach that it required. At times, his ramblings, drunken stupors, and facial expressions were entertaining, some well-timed jokes matching perfectly with the theme. Yet there were other moments where Snoop Dogg was able to steal the show just being himself. This Bum was able to get some laughs at, but it didn't quite leave me in stitches like other comedies do.
Instead, the movie does get points for the ""experience"" component of it. Moon dog's journey does have a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, that once it arrives turns out to be a semi-inspirational message that I think will please the target audience. However, the path to get there is not going to be for everyone, but fortunately the movie has a couple of other high points for me that might make it better. One of them is the fact that the movie is under 2 hours long so we get to the end hopefully faster. The second and probably best thing for me though, is the great musical score that spans a number of decades that really sells the feelings that Moon dog is putting down in his sequences. That track listing has a good toe tapping theme to it and it works so well for this reviewer.DISLIKESAimless wandering
Very Slow
Very Ridiculous
Horrible Means
Lazy Writing
Cameos are okay
Graphic displays of life
Not as Witty as I was hoping
Too Artistic OverallSUMMARY:Taking artistic approaches is a gamble and sometimes it will only hit the target audience, and that is the case for me for this film. With Moon dog being a free spirit capable of hitting so many avenues he aimlessly wanders around in the film, with little to no point to his amblings. The result is a movie that feels like it's going nowhere for me, with pacing that feels slow as molasses with the minutes dragging by. Perhaps it's the ridiculous concepts and the horrible means by how the stoner accomplishes his goals is not the most entertaining or plot driven component. If that's the kind of style you are looking for in a movie, then you'll find great joy in this movie.
Other components that did not work well with me started with some of the lazy writing. Moon dog and company don't have the best vocabulary. While this may work well with the mindset he established, hearing the copious number of cursing and graphic metaphors did nothing, but grow stale for me by the first third of the movie. In addition, watching Moon dog do horrible things to people, wasn't even that fun for me, with the carefree debauchery more revolting that thrilling to watch as the sad story continued to progress. Perhaps the cameos could have saved it, but again the movie didn't quite utilize in the means I was hoping to get from the glimpses the trailers provided. Most of the celebrities were just as sad of messes, offering little more than more bouts of lazy writing and stupid risk taking that was a sad spectacle. Other times, it merely involved McConaughey's character taking advantage of the extras and side actors, in displays I care not to have my eyes exposed too for long bouts. The Beach Bum's first third felt much like a porno, which isn't my cup of tea when going to see most films. In addition, we all know that comedies can sometimes be designed for stupid fun, but this journey lacked any sort of wit and resorted to simplistic stoner techniques that did nothing for me in terms of comedic gold . As such, the bottom line comes down to the movie being a little too free spirited itself to make for an engaging story or adventure to tell.The VERDICT:I agree with the other reviewers that the movie is artistic and a little more original in its approach than most movies will take. However, I don't think the risk paid off well when it came to this reviewer's preference for a movie. Unlike Seinfeld, this movie about nothing but living life just didn't entertain, and the meandering around the state of Florida doing nothing but smashing the rules, acting stupid, and acting as a PSA for the repercussions of chronic substance abuse are not my idea of a theater movie. Perhaps if left to made for television or streaming it would get higher, but in regards to the other comedies coming out I recommend passing this one up for something else that is worth the price of admission. My scores are:Comedy: 5.5
Movie Overall: 3.0",The Beach Bum
21,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Beach Bum,6,29 March 2019,"Stephen Bishop's ""On and On"" is featured on the soundtrack of The Beach Bum (my latest review). ""Beach Bum"" the movie, well it wanders massively. It too just goes ""on and on"". On another note, Eddie Money's ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" is featured as well. ""Beach Bum's"" setting is ""paradise"" that stinks real pretty.The Beach Bum while amusing, still could've used a slight mantra of a script. It's about a drugged-up writer named Moondog who must pen a final poetry book in order to claim the rich inheritance of his dead wife. Foul-mouthed, sloppy, g-stringed, pot enhanced, and containing clips of simultaneous junk grabbing, The Beach Bum comes off like a bunch of random scenes snipped from the cutting room floor. I was regaled but sort of shook my head as the final credits came up.So OK, ""Beach Bum"" is like 1987's Barfly for the South Beach circuit. It's also kinda like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas without the souped-up paranoia. With a look containing purple, orange, and blue hues, The Beach Bum might be the most beautiful, scuzzbucket of a movie I've ever seen. ""One day I will swallow up the world"". Indeed.""Beach Bum"" is directed by Harmony Korine. Harmony makes films and I don't think he cares whether you like them or not. As a legend in the art of off-kilter framing and pitying, self-indulgence, Korine puts his muse (Matthew McConaughey as Moondog) in nearly every frame.McConaughey as a gentler version of Mickey Rourke's Henry Chinaski, doesn't really give a performance. He just acts a fool without knowing that the cameras are even rolling. Matthew's Moondog is the type of footloose character we all want to be for a day. The sad part is I don't think anyone would even attempt to try it.In conclusion, ""Beach Bum"" has well known actors like Zac Efron, Snoop Dogg, Jonah Hill, and Martin Lawrence making appearances but not exactly registering in terms of plot mechanics (or lack of plot mechanics). They are there to sort of ensure that Moondog is the Forrest Gump or Zelig of kooky junkies.Bottom line: The Beach Bum slightly hinders its message about being yourself and not caring what the heck anybody thinks. This flick might turn out to be a stoner classic as long as you actually get stoned while watching it (for the record, I don't endorse this action). Heck, if I had a dime for every time someone lit up a joint in ""Beach Bum"", I'd be a darn millionaire. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",The Beach Bum

23,rockman182,The Beach Bum (2019),6,29 March 2019,"It takes me a while to warm up to Harmony Korine films. I hated Spring Breakers on first viewing but upon a rewatch was able to find the quality in it despite it being a really polarizing venture. The Beach Bum kind of looked like the same but probably with heightened drugs, sex, and chill. That's exactly what it was. The film is frustratingly unfocused and seems bereft of a plot but I had a sort of decent time with it.The film is about a former writer slacker who spends his days near the water smoking weed, drinking, and having sex. The film follows him on his journey where he meets up with his ex girlfriend and goes on adventures with like minded people in the Florida region. His life seems free and problem-less and maybe that is the case, but you're still going on the journey. The film also stars Isla Fischer and, yes you guessed it, the one and only Snoop Dogg. Interestingly, the films main poster looks like one Marvel would put out.Korine must have had a very loose script for this I can imagine the idea coming to home after smoking his brains out. Yet, Matthew McConaughey is still perfectly cast. He gets to the play the role you know he always wanted to play. His Moondog is a very outlandish character in all forms, kind of a like a more chilled out Alien, from Spring Breakers. There are few quite humorous moments where I burst out laughing.Its overall dumb and you get what you expect with it. It will feel tedious at times but much like Korines work there is a real endearing quality to it. This is probably the most non-consequential film I've seen from here.

24,SameirAli,Stoner Moondog.,6,27 October 2021,"The film is totally a stoner-comedy. So, prepared to watch it as if you are high. The camera work and direction perfectly gives that mood. Moondog does all that crazy stuff of a perfect stoner poet. Now... that's poetic.",The Beach Bum
25,CANpatbuck3664,"The Beach Bum is Neither Funny or Entertaining, Its Just Horrible on Every Level",2,31 July 2019,"I want to give a disclaimer to this review, I walked into The Beach Bum with an open mind and an open heart. This isn't a case of ""you just don't get it"" or ""this movie just wasn't made for you."" I tried to meet this movie on every level and it failed me every time I tried to give it some slack. I'm going to start with the complete absence of plot or forward momentum in this movie. Our main character is Moondog (Matthew McConaughey) who's a poetry legend but is more at home smoking weed on the beach than reading the classics. Much like our supposed hero, The Beach Bum isn't interested in making sense or creating something that can be understood. There is barely any continuity and with the ending they chose to go with, that small amount of continuity is just thrown away in the last 5-10 minutes. I wasn't mad, I was in disbelief at how little story there was in this. Comedy may be subjective but even if the movie had been riotously funny, this still would have tripped me up. Don't give me the stoner movie excuse either. You can make a funny stoner comedy and still have a decent plot (Pineapple Express), Korine and his team don't just fail to tell a story here, they don't even try. They sail through the movie much like Moondog , just screwing around without any kind of a plan and gleefully flipping off anyone who asks any questions.Getting to the characters next, why should we like Moondog at all? He's only interested in himself, he lies, cheats and steals to get what he wants and he's completely bought into his own hype when he's constantly screwing up. He's a waste of space that only cares about getting his next fix (that's not a slight against marijuana users in general, its specific to this unlikeable stoner). Yet everyone adores him for an inexplicable reason (I know he's a famous writer but there's little substance to any of his work in the movie). I have the same things to say for his friends Lingerie (Snoop Dog), his wife Minnie (Isla Fisher) and Lewis (Jonah Hill). They're all arrogant, self-indulgent idiots who just spew garbage most of the movie. The only one who seems to be in the ballpark of reality is his daughter Heather (Stefania LaVie Owen) and even she's way too forgiving of him. He also does something pretty heinous in the middle of the movie and faces almost no consequences for it. So this movie flunks the character development section as well.How Korine was able to assemble this cast with what was presumably the script for this movie is beyond me. I respect McConaughey's commitment to smaller and more offbeat projects, he's not just cashing in on winning that Oscar and he's trying to do different things. The problem is that he's just having terrible luck picking projects (more on that later). He's a great actor and while he's got some connections to this character, he's still not good in this role (even if this movie is doing him no favours with the character). Fisher, Snoop Dog, Hill, Zac Efron and even LaVie Owen are decent to great actors but I couldn't separate them from their characters. I'll give them a pass although their collective decisions to be in this project are confounding. The only person I won't go to task on is Martin Lawrence who we haven't seen in a long time and I won't begrudge him for working to get back up there.The last thing I want to comment on is that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. You may be asking, ""Even if all that other stuff sucks, is it funny? That can make up for a lot."" The answer is a definitive NO. There was the potential for a couple of funny scenes (Lawrence's character being such an incompetent boat captain that he can't distinguish between a shark and a dolphin could have been funny) but I didn't even chuckle. The humour here is definitely of the acquired taste variety and it didn't translate for me at all.Korine gained some notoriety and a cult following after the release of Spring Breakers. I didn't see that so I can't comment but the only way I can rationalize this getting made is Korine's reputation for being different and crazy brought these people in or that they offered to pay McConaughey in the weed that's shown in the movie and then just filmed his antics after he consumed it. This is a pointless and meandering mess and if it had something to say, it missed that goal by miles. I thought that McConaughey's previous misfire Serenity would be the low point in his recent output but at least that was so off-the-wall funny/bad in an endearing and earnest way. The Beach Bum isn't that flavour of campy fun, its just awful and it comes across as arrogant. The positive reviews from the professional critics are just boggling, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in the past few years and its an AVOID AT ALL COSTS recommendation from me.",The Beach Bum

28,statuskuo,It Depends On Who You Are,7,30 March 2019,"Everyone has that friend where good things happen despite how inept he is. Though a singular talent gets him the spoils of the rich. And that can be incredibly annoying to people who work hard to get there. At a certain point, Matthew McConnaughy's Moondog character gets under your skin, because of what people of color may deem ""white privilege"" This movie tends to argue, wealth privilege, regardless of how he obtains it.
The other side is that he is obnoxiously unrepentant drug addled nitwit. He has some talent (which the characters exposit in a very clunky way) but has wiped his mind of responsibility. The freedom expressed here MAY have existed in pre-PC culture, but somehow, he dodges this. In fact, he gathers the admiration of Key West low society. Money means nothing to him. Not having means nothing to him. In an existential level, it is about the present. Despite reality that he'd be dead with a broken bottle to his neck.
However, this is a beautiful film. Beautiful to look at yet ugly insides. It argues we have the freedom to enjoy our lives without the chains that shackle us to societal norms. NO, rich people do. They are showered with money to do as they please. In fact, Jonah Hill at one point expresses the exact sentiment.
Director Harmony Korine does like to antagonize. He is that kid who when you told him something he did annoys you, he'd step up his efforts. He's annoying. Yet, he's never NOT interesting. And that is the fine line most people will not accept. There are many films out there that can serve as its compendium...""Wonderboys"" comes to mind. Or ""The Big Lebowski"" though...somehow there is an emptiness in the message of shedding the shackles of life. It's there, but you have to let it absorb you.
I would also say, if you watch it, sit as close to the screen without craning your neck. It is an immersive film. BEAUTIFUL in its look at south Florida, shot lovingly at late afternoon hours. The feeling similar to the boozy slow living Jimmy Buffet concert (he's in the film). Do I like it? Yes. Something tells me it has its heart in the proper place. Though, I wonder about extending some of the crass nods to Isla Fisher. She is less a freespirit as a rich girl who became thug culture pin cushion.

Cheech and Chong knew how to do these and few others have ever figured it out, and nobody involved in this does, that 's for damn sure.This movie is epically immoral, MM is, as is often the case, totally irritating and this movie is gonna' kill more people than any movie since NATURAL BORN KILLERS.It's a total amoral celebration of being high your whole life killing people accidentally and getting away with it all. It's ineptly directed and virtually laughless featuring a supporting cast of known actors most of whom seem to be disguised so as to escape being recognized as being in this train wreck.I have no idea what they were thinking though that I guess is part of its epically bad charm.If you ever feel your wasting your life--this movie will prove you're not by comparison. How or why this got made is incredible enough, but at least it's not a super hero movie.The scene with the severed foot was the only genuine laugh I got, adding to the ""fun"" is frequent out of shape women shaking their lumpy butts and boobs around in the background of many scenes. Is this the point? Like pretty much everything in this film it's a mystery as to what they were thinking why they were thinking it and why they are wasting your time showing it to you.Snoop Dog and what's his name, his fans are called parrot heads, appear in many scenes, and there is a hilariously giant joint in many scenes.It's gonzo gone to hell a celebration of being high and drunk and that being the reason to live.Now this could be seen as one, of too many, movies showing tragically messed up ""artists"" who are great artists so we are to forgive the fact they are awful human beings. In this case MM's character is supposed to be a great poet, but the brief bits of poems we hear from him are awful. So again is this the point?So what's not to like?

It's very small scale, we follow Moondog as he gets drunk, he gets high and just does other things sometimes too.I love Moondog as a character. He says he just wants to have fun but there is more to him than just that. It's clear that he finds it hard to cope with his wife's death even if he tries to hide his pain, and we hear people talk about his abusive parents. Some long-term consequences of being abused as a child are, substance abuse and sex addiction, among other effects. Moondog has to try and overcome drug and sex addiction but he is incredibly reluctant to do so, he doesn't want to be sober because the drink and the drugs is whats keeping him going, he'll be a depressed otherwise.I loved spring breakers so I had high hopes for the beach bum, in most ways my expectations were met. But I was pretty disappointed by the technical aspects. Spring breakers was technically unique, the beach bum is bland in comparison, I feel having more interesting technical choices would have made the movie more... Interesting.The beach bum was a hilarious simple story of a broken person, but it is more unconventional than your average victem of child abuse and drug addiction story as it's comedy, and a funny one at that.

38,youngcollind,The Beach Bum gets stuck in the shallow end,5,16 August 2021,"Harmony Korine is certainly an adept filmmaker, who's keen visual eye showcases a tapestry of vivid colours. The cast is a revolving door of A listers who all turn in competent performances. In typical Korine fashion, the plot forgoes a traditional narrative and chooses to aimlessly meander from one sequence to the next, focusing on McConaughey's Moon Dog character, and his relentless pursuit of unfiltered hedonism. The movie refuses to condemn the character even as his selfishness negatively impacts those around him, but also fails to make his freewheeling philosophy seem innocent or likeable, as it frequently points out how much privilege is necessary for such gluttony. In the end, the intentionally vague morality makes the film feel sort of hollow, like watching a two hour bling rap video that gleefully celebrates excess without properly examining it's consequences.",The Beach Bum

What started as a promising and artful career in film has slumped to a still visually impressive but extremely cringeworthy and eyeroll inducing orgy of sex and drugs that seems almost patented for millennials and easily impressed adults.

While it is fun to see and hear the star and Snoop Dogg rapping and having fun, there's something not quite true here. That is especially evident with Fisher, who seems to be stretching her chops too far, so that you're always aware she's acting, not inhabiting the character: a far cry from the real people who made up the brilliant ""Kids."" While ""The Beach Bum"" has its fun moments and the bacchanalian atmosphere is seductive, the result is more tedium than fun.

42,babyjaguar,BEACH-BUMMED: TRANSGRESSION RESIDUE FROM THE 90S,6,30 March 2019,"""The Beach Bum"" written and directed by the original, Harmony Korine explores the usual tropes of late 90s independent cinema. This time replacing the essence of amateur acting (and James Franco) with top-billed talents of Matthew McConaughey, Snoop Dogg and Isla Fisher.Many reviews have criticized that this film is not an innovative film from Korine, but it does reenact what 90s White acts of transgression looked like. Fisher provided a good performance as Moondog's wealthy wife, Minnie if only for a brief time and the Dogg was great as Lingerine, a good friend (?) to them.Surprisingly, what is fresh comes from the short performance by Martin Lawrence, playing the outrageous character, Capt. Whack! Lawrence plays a good friend of Moondog (MConaughey) and I feel its the best scene of the whole film, its slapstick comedy with much satire and even gore!The film drags in a way, for only 90s drug generation and Gen Xers would understand: the ""slacker"".

Moondog is afraid of being afraid, never wants the party to stop, has cool friends like Snoop Dogg and Zac Efron, writes anarchistic poetry, and might really mean it when he says he's Up for Whatever.At his worst, Moondog is an emotionally underdeveloped nihilist who is too whacked-out to notice he is hurting the people he thinks he's helping, never there to help pick up the shattered pieces or thread back together the tatters left behind. He chooses to dance under consciousness, incapable of fitting in with the normies.A mystery that remains unsolved is whether McConaughey is acting. Another mystery is what accent was Jonah Hill trying to effectuate, or maybe he isn't acting, either.A life of ease implies irresponsibility, apathy, and money.

47,paulijcalderon,Time to reverb back and forth until you hit the frequency,7,2 April 2019,"I felt weird after having seen ""The Beach Bum"". I walked to my kitchen and began an odd tantrum to my friend about how life is fun and filled with possibilities. Just live it, enjoy it, make the most of it. Unfortunately this movie has not gotten a premiere date in Sweden, so I'll admit that I began to see the leaked version and I just couldn't stop watching. Even if it wasn't the best experience, I was somehow hooked by the aura and philosophy of Moondog. Harmony Korine seems to have a habit of telling stories of those odd people who aren't afraid to be themselves to the fullest. I appreciate that he finds those voices. The voices of those who usually aren't listened to in the mainstream. Before this I had only seen ""Spring Breakers"" , and I will say that I was more transfixed by this movie. Mostly due to the character really. Matthew McConaughey is Moondog, there is no question about it. He's also surrounded by a parade of magnificent supporting characters, which elevates the trip to the next level. That being said, Moondog's story won't be everyone's cup of tea.Our main character begins the story as irreverent as he can be. He takes no responsibility. Literary living his life by his own rules. He has become so wealthy due to his poetry that he feels he can do anything. The audience may feel dismay here since Moondog is acting this way around people and showing only but a slight bit of concern. I never tuned out though, as I knew that Moondog would have to find a way to balance his drug fueled habits, his family and his economy. At first you think the character will go through some sort of life altering adventure, but no. It's more of a ""accepting of who you are"" story. Being aware of ones issues and controlling yourself. Moondog's descriptions of how and why he writes poetry will be engraved in my mind for awhile. Like I said before, I simply felt weird after the movie ended, but in an optimistic way. Moondog hit some slopes and made mistakes. But at the end of the day nobody is truly perfect. You can take great lessons from your mistakes and move forward. It's difficult to rate the ""The Beach Bum"". I will see it again once it's available in better quality and with a fresh new mindset. In the meantime: Do what you love to do and follow the road to wherever your inspiration takes you.",The Beach Bum

The director of ""The Beach Bum"" (Korine, who made the much appreciated ""Spring Breakers"") is more concerned with showing people's life experiences, instead of delving deeper and doing character development and so on ; I believe there is nothing wrong in doing that.

50,ajzeg,This is a strange movie.,6,21 September 2019,"It has a strange story with strange characters with a strange structure. Now, I like strange movies, like The Big Lebowski (Which I feel this movie was trying to be like.), but I don't know, I think this one might be a little too all over the place for my liking. Well, what's the story? Matthew McConaughey plays Moondog, a drunken pot smoking coke snorting womanizer. He is also a brilliant poet. He's also married, but his wife is well aware of his habits and is 100% okay with them. They love each other very much. But one day, his wife dies in a car accident and leaves him and their daughter with her entire fortune. However, he isn't getting any of the money until he matures and writes his novel. From there, Moondog kind of just wanders around from weird character and weird situation to another weird character and weird situation. It is very meandering and it doesn't really have much of a focus. Now, The Big Lebowski is also pretty all over the place, but it had really strong characters, strong performances, a ton of great comedy and genuinely fascinating philosophy. I don't feel like The Beach Bum really had that. A lot of the performances are fairly one-note and they got kind of old, such as the main character and his friend played by Snoop Dogg. The cast is very hit or miss. Zac Efron and Isla Fisher were good, but Jonah Hill wasn't great. It's a mixed bag. The movie has a good soundtrack, the editing had some personality, and this movie is very colourful. All the colours are super warm and nice to look at. It really does feel like chilling on the beach in the summertime. That's another thing I enjoyed, I liked the laid-back chill vibe this movie has. I was never bored. I got some laughs out of this movie, but I wouldn't say it was hilarious. I also appreciated that this movie was unapologetically trashy. There's drugs and sex everywhere! Definitely not for kids!

He married into Money and loses it until he can write another successful book.
Trouble is all his original poetry he quotes is junior high school level at best or plagiarised.

Doesn't care when his wife of 20 some years dies...then again she was doin snoop dog behind his back...as was he doin whoever & whatever he wanted also tho, and his daughter, her husband & zac Efron are unlikable characters too. I mean are we supposed to like or care about the people n this movie?? Because I didn't whatsoever & the only funny or good scene was dolphin boat scene which even coulda been done better in a lot of ways....""Wtf did we just watch"" is all I could say when it was over.",The Beach Bum
54,seige-hound,"A Weird, disjointed drug fuelled adventure",5,6 August 2019,"Matthew McConaughey plays Moondog, a successful poet who is rich, but lives his life like a drug-addicted homeless person. He gets away with a lot, has sex in public, is always drunk or high, and has women both young and old chase after him.It's hard to describe the plot beyond that, because there really isn't any.This film is 95 minutes long, but it felt like a 4 hour epic, because it doesn't conform to a traditional story structure. about half an hour into the film we have what looks like an interesting plot thread, but that is almost immediately abandoned for another little adventure. And another, and another until it finally ends.The film is pretty. Korine is a fantastic visual director, and he seems to be able to bring the beauty out of depravity and hedonism. He's a master with a camera, but not so much with a pen and paper, and also not so much with a computer and editing software. I guess if the idea was to make the audience feel like they're on drugs and losing time, it does succeed. Often the film will cut from one scene to the next, then back to the first scene, then back to the second, before moving on. It creates a sense of timelessness, as if the last two weeks were intertwining together. It is an interesting effect, but I wouldn't call it an entertaining one.The film also has a lot of ad-libbing and improv. My guess is most of the dialogue wasn't written, but more suggested, and had the actors just making stuff up on the spot based on the situation. Sort of like a comedy, except without being that funny.The best way I could describe this film is as an Arthouse Raunchy Comedy. Plenty of sex, nudity and drugs, but the way it's presented isn't really directed to the average filmgoer.Overall, I would say I enjoyed parts, and the overall aesthetic of the film was something that I greatly appreciated, but it isn't something that I would normally see. Spring Breakers was weird enough for me, and from what I've heard, that's Korine's most 'normal' movie. See it if you think a love letter to hedonism is a good watch for you.",The Beach Bum

There are some pretty random moments that almost jump the shark and make the movie a little too absurd, but then I remember what I'm watching and can forgive it.

The exception to this is Jimmy Buffet, who Korine assumably just wanted to hang out with, since we've seen better acting from a house plant.The story of 'The Beach Bum' and the character of Moon Dog aren't very deep.

Everyone else in this is just a side-piece.
And within half an hour I completely forgot that McConaughey ever played a serious role in his life. A true embodiment of the ultimate beach bum with a whole lot of benefits.
But at the same time, it also feels like Matt decided to take a break from regular work and just party with other Hollywood folk whilst being filmed for a few weeks. Is that too much of a stretch to imagine? Life is often stranger than fiction after all.In some ways, writer/director Harmony Korine hasn't strayed too far from his early beginnings (Gummo - 1997) - he's just using Hollywood actors now and pretty color palettes.But this movie made me envious a bit. Much like L.A., South Florida looks like a wonderland that exists in its own universe.

I absolutely adored Matthew McConaughey's performance as Moondog and was genuinely on board for the first part of the movie, yet I think that THE BEACH BUM is essentially hypocritical.While apparently a lot of people have taken issue with an alleged lack of plot for Harmony Korine's latest, my viewing experience didn't coincide with that point of criticism at all. On the contrary, the way the background story with Moondog publishing his book suddenly came to the fore during the last act and wrapped up in an awkwardly naive way (""Pulitzer"" is all I'm gonna say here) took away most of the enjoyment of the film's initial simplicity in my opinion.More importantly though, as the film goes on it increasingly reveals a fundamental ignorance towards the rest of the world by Moondog's character - something another reviewer aptly identified as a mean-spirited ""underlying selfishness"" to the film. It essentially portrays the journey of a rich egocentric asshole who chooses to live the life of a beach bum because he has the means to do so - and literally burns millions of dollars while laughing in a completely self-centered act during the last scene.Whether Korine aimed for that or not, his supposedly free-spirited film ironically portrays a highly conservative version of the American Dream and thus essentially thwarts the sole purpose of the story by the end.",The Beach Bum

75,thetyvonlesure,Low Brow Frivolity,4,26 August 2019,"The Beach Bum is a movie that continues director, Harmony Korine's run of abstract storytelling with shock value. While this film excels in shock and weirdness, it lacks in substance or anything of significance. Unlike Korine's other flicks, there's no cautionary tale being told. There's no ramifications for anything that happens. Instead, the film presents an unfocused story about a whacked out, once-great Poet trying to redeem himself; while simultaneously NOT trying to redeem himself. The theme of having fun just to have fun is presented in a very immature and ignorant manner. Why should we care about Moondog, when he doesn't care about himself? The film coasts without offering much outside of drug abuse, sex, and unnecessary profanity. The cast is great, despite being oddities. As weird and ignorant as the writing was, it works well with actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Zac Efron, Jonah Hill, and Isla Fisher. Their roles are so unique that they effortlessly pull off these strange characters. The only casting flub is Snoop Dogg, as he's just playing a coked out version of himself. The cinematography is well done. It looks beautiful. Harmony Korine is exceptional in presenting his films as if they were sleazy music videos. The editing in the film is smooth in a weird way. The jump cuts work well with the film's aesthetic. The soundtrack is incredibly out of place, and it brings a sense of incohesion to an already faltering flick. Overall, The Beach Bum is a film that lacks any substance or relevance, serving as a ""man overboard"" in Harmony Korine's unique filmography.",The Beach Bum

That approach inevitably leads to the occasional disappointment. This is my most recent disappointment in that regard.
McConaughey's character is like the Mr. Hyde half of the stoner type characters he has often played. His ex-wife likes what he used to be, as does his daughter. Instead of criticizing his behavior, they seem to be waiting for him to straighten himself out. But, a man who comes to his daughter's wedding loaded and makes an entrance by pushing a wheelchair-bound woman into the pool does not seem like someone trying to change their ways. But, no one seems to mind. Sadly, there are some who find him funny and their enjoyment of his deeds serves to encourage his behavior.I never laughed, even once, throughout the movie. Though, I did groan a few times. The scene on the dolphin boat was pointless and made even worse by having two children as a part of the group in the scene. The twist near the close of the movie seemed obvious half-way through and the actual ending did not make sense to me, at all.

79,ReadingFilm,The Last Movie,10,31 March 2019,"Another post-irony prank. Remember in Spring Breakers how there was this trace of conscience behind it? Just enough to see it at social critique as the girls gradually drop out and return back to humanity or face the consequences of their actions, bringing forth some accountable artist at work behind it. Beach Bum hints at avenues where it might go there with the daughters tiredness and stoicism, the ex-wife's fate, and his legal repercussions; but any traces of lessons, growth or consequences are stomped to pieces moments later. Korine's artist commentary is strangely hidden in its excess. Every one of my audience walked out. It's so gleefully immoral that in this universe he's rewarded with the highest accolades society can offer because nothing matters.""He just makes me so crazy."" Constantly it makes fun of any kind of real authenticity people can have between each other. It's sarcastic Terrence Malick. It don't care about nothing. A canary in the cold mine in late stage capitalism where one has these infinite resources and distribution, to make fun of god. The court jester throws out his inhibition to mock the king, laughing while getting hanged for it. Problem with both this and Spring Breakers is they become the real deal, actual culture in the process of their critique. While works like this you can only see the meaning in the opposite. So the film's function seems to be mocking its own audience and their motives to see it in the first place.Think of the performance art as the juggle of financing, banking, courting the industry to make this at all, reflecting the machine's decay against itself. You could hate getting dragged through the mud but it's pretty much the definition of iconoclast. Korine said, ""These films mean nothing to me and everything."" As in it's his way of chipping away and bringing down the structure from within. Its existence is an act in radical accelerationism. The end of the empire. collapse, civil war, the global digital juggernaut paradise-hell.The ones not concerned with the world around them move the same direction except within delight.Then the moral frame missing unlocks its true motive in reflecting the surrounding culture at war. Individual to a satiric extreme; laissez-fair 'life is fun, have a laugh, there's Moondog in all of us', while really believing the opposite. Bum is a pejorative. The film's conscience is not missing but inherent, and all the 'endearing' and 'feel good,' despite its endless evils and debauchery, are maybe being fooled by Moondog's charm, which might have been its actual prank.",The Beach Bum

Written and directed by Harmony KorineOh Matthew McConaughey and Harmony Korine you scoundrels. What have you done? How do I even describe this movie? It takes place in Miami and Key West, Florida. Everything is drenched in neon pastel colors. Matthew McConaughey plays Moondog, a poet married to a rich woman who drifts through life getting drunk, getting high, engaging in sexual activities,forgetting his daughter's age and wedding, hitting people into the water,stealing boats, and causing an obscene amount of damage to other people's property. But this is all okay because he is a genius writer.This is an odd movie because everything is played for laughs. Moondog doesn't seem to be phased by anything. Literally anything that would bring a regular person to the brink of mental collapse. Moondog just gets high and moves on. He is constantly moving on through a series of wacky ""friends"".It is funny for a brief moment until you realize how sad and pathetic it really is. The whimsical nature of the presentation is holding back the depression and the standards that he can no longer live up to. This is just a guess because Moondog does not care one bit.

Where is this genius and is this worth the wreckage he leaves behind?You'll have to see it for yourself. I can't recommend this movie. I was fascinated by it after the fact. It is a strange story.

89,andrewhumphreys9968,The Beach Bum - 9/10,9,14 September 2020,"Matthew McConaughey makes self-destruction look fun in this meandering stoner comedy from Harmony Korine. As free a spirit as he is, protagonist Moondog doesn't spend the whole movie smooth-sailing, he's thrown through the wringer in a pretty drastic way, but his resultant behaviour is what cements his near-mythical status.Described by his wife, played by Isla Fisher, as being from another dimension, it doesn't take long to see what she means and while some of Moondog's decisions are definitely questionable, it's hard to not have faith in them. As well as Fisher, McConaughey his supporter by Korine's biggest cast yet including Jonah Hill, Zac Efron and Snoop Dogg.Zac Efron's not in the film long, but he makes an impact as glue-huffing pyromaniac Moondog meets in rehab. Hill's accent isn't too solid, but his dialogue's hilarious, playing Moondog's agent (he writes poetry.) Snoop Dogg basically plays an extension of himself, he's still fun to watch though. Martin Lawrence also stars and there's a small, but incredibly fitting, cameo from Jimmy Buffet.There's a lot of weed smoked in this film and you can tell McConaughey's pretty baked in all his scenes. It's definitely best seen under the influence, the plot's half-baked and the camera-work lingers a lot, which lets you catch up if you're a bit too far gone. Speaking of, the cinematography's also really nice and feels in line with Korine's equally sun-soaked Spring Breakers.The soundtrack's awesome, as can be expected from Korine, and features a variety of genres and musicians, some of which are well-known and others not as much. Korine's no stranger to having obscure songs, sub-genres and musicians featured in his soundtrack's, but there's also hits from The Cure, Creed and Waylon Jennings. Buffet and Snoop are obviously featured in it too, including an original song for the film called Moonfog.All in all, this movie's a good time and is one of the funniest film's I've seen from 2019. This is the McConaughey equivalent of going full Nicolas Cage and it just goes to show he can do comedy just as well as he can do drama. In the realms of stoner comedies, there's a surprising amount of underlying themes here like grief and love. Worth seeing for McConaughey alone and it's a very easy film to follow, but I'd definitely advise seeing it with a bud.",The Beach Bum

The investors can't be happy, doesn't look like they made any money on it according to the digits here on IMDB.I am all for some drinking and some weed, but I guess having Snoop Dog in the film pushed them to the point of weed ridiculous. I'm not sure what era or year this was depicting exactly, but good weed these days is far to potent to smoke at the levels consumed in this flick.The Character Moondog is never a pleasant thing to be around in real life and wasn't in this movie. He was as interesting as a car crash, and everyone wants to stop and look at those but doesn't want to stay nearby.I see positive reviewers referring to this as an ""arthouse"" film. OK, that explains why only a select few really like the movie. Art House films are an expression of the artist, and Harmony Korine is clearly nuts...which is expressed in this film. I don't know of his other works and don't really follow writers and directors because even sane ones have bad movies, but I may remember Harmony Korine's name just so I don't have to waste my time on another one of his flicks.From IMDB's own bio of this person: ""Often depicts teenagers doing violent and disturbing things (i.e. Drug abuse, incest, sex addiction, murder)""I don't mind showing teens doing some things we all know some do, but as a habit, I would say this is sick...not entertainment.

93,jdowney-57-371157,The Greatest Super Hero Movie of all Time,1,23 July 2019,"This movie is about a Super Hero. He defeats every obstacle placed in his way. He can not be stopped. He pays no consequences for any of his behaviors. He lives his life by his own moral code, a code that other men lack the brilliance or courage to live by.His greatest enemy is civilization and its conventions.We travel with him on a remarkable journey, as he is called home from his Fortress of Solitude, hidden among tourist traps in Key West, back to Miami. His wealthy wife puts obstacles in his way: screwing Snoop dog and dying in the drunken car wreck our hero causes. But luckily, there are no consequences to this except he is short on cash because she played a super hero trick on him. Being the worlds greatest poet, he must complete a book of poetry to get back his 50 million dollars of her estate. But...after murdering her, which he is not arrested for, he is arrested for bringing homeless bums to her estate, breaking in and throwing a pool party. So he goes to rehab were he meets Robin, and the two of them break out and beat and rob a guy for beer money, and then go on a super party with a bunch of chicks. Then he hangs out with Snoop ,where his greatest super power, not giving a crap about anything, and having no hard feelings about Snoop banging the wife, gets Snoop to give him some Super Weed, which allows him to write the greatest book of poetry ever written, conquering the human race and winning both a Pulitzer and his money back. So he gets the 50 million in cash, throws a super party, with fireworks, where he exhibits his super power again, by blowing up the cash, and floating away lazily forever laughing and not giving a crap.I will never be able to go back to DC or Marvel again. This is it. At the end we learn that our Super Hero's power may be due to the force of Life actually conspiring to make his soul happy. That is his power. No crappy suits, no bat mobiles, no magic hammers, just Life makes him that way. Stan Lee is rolling over in his grave.",The Beach Bum

This is typical of the Hollywood playbook these days.The film had no plot to speak of and rambled on and on repeating the message: take drugs and ignore your responsibilities.If I had to guess, I would think that it was written by a couple of druggies while stoned and then read by another one who thought it was a good idea.",The Beach Bum

There really is no established plot...we just spend an hour and a half following a stoner poet named Moondog who ""lives life by his own rules.""There are a few fun moments throughout, but before long the antics of Moondog and his companions become annoying and unfunny. Not one time did I feel any sort of connection to any of the characters, as there is practically zero emotional depth. At one point Moondog confirms that his best friend had been having a long affair with his deceased wife. This, of course, doesn't bother him at all. For the love of God, everything is just ""happy sunshine, rainbows, and fun"" all the damn time.Obviously, this is the kind of positive message that Harmony Korine wants to convey, and I respect The Beach Bum for not trying to be something its not. This will appeal to a certain type of crowd and may even be encouraging to some. But it just seems like such an undeveloped idea and of course unrealistic.I really didn't like this movie at all, but I recognize it is probably one of the most subjective experiences this year in film. The story and the characters were dull and the recurring theme in the film of ""no matter what, just have fun"" got incredibly old incredibly fast. If that sounds appealing to you, go enjoy The Beach Bum.

Familiar waters with how he lives his life when just is all about good vibes & making hamburgers in the roach coach. When his significant other truly @ deeply has feelings for him, she & lingerie have other motives. He does eventually come to grips with when his daughter tie the knot with her fiancée.
""2 thumbs up"" (Siskel & Ebert) More is involved when a tragedy strikes down unexpectedly while celebrating at their daughter's wedding at the after-party splash. The concept of happiness is a good virtue to have when such status of one's worth. Just leave it to the typewriter which is preferred above 22nd century technology. It does make more sense that his wife will only lead him to the fortune unless he meets certain requirements of these demands. Which in the long run makes for a complete person that uses god given talents & taps into the left & right side of the cerebellum. It is of true passion comes to just limber along.
This Persona de grada finally gets the chance he deserves after his pastor (who gets ordained just for this ceremony) comes clean of his deeds. Knowing that best buds are hard to come by these days, he meets up with captain whack.

I'm sad this has only grossed 2.4 million (on a 5 million dollar budget) as of now. It's McConaughey's worst film opening ever, and it makes no sense to me because his performance is excellent. Serenity Film was absolutely horrible! I understand why it did so bad at the box office. My wife and I literally walked out of that movie. The Beach Bum (on the other hand) is the total opposite end of the spectrum. It's raunchy and celebrates bad behavior, but it's a really good time and has heart!

And you have a lot of sex and boozing and assorted debaucheries. This film is clearly not intended for people who never let go of their inhibitions in their youth. For those who did, it will provide a bittersweet reminder that some of the best times in one's life are experienced while sensually living in the moment.

122,cupofsoulshow,A Middle movie with no real beginning or ending,5,22 March 2019,"Beach Bum is a movie about Moondog. He's a staple in Key West where he spends his days getting high, drinking PBR and occasionally writing. He's a poet by profession but dedicates all his time medicated. He has a wife that has a lover and a daughter that settled into marrying a man so dull he makes a Mormon seem exciting.Beach Bum is director Harmony Korine recent attempt to highlight a character that colors outside the lines. If you're familiar with his work, you know that his movie pace can be belaboring such is the case here.Matthew McConaughey playing a Stoner is not a stretch. Those expectations remain low upon viewing this movie.Beach Bum has many issues. The movie boasts an all-star cast but grossly misuses them.The concept for Beach Bum wasn't wrong; its execution is what was troublesome.Moondog eccentric mannerism was only charming for an hour after that it became laboring.Snoop Dog was also misplaced. One would think a movie that features weed as one of the themes and the charisma of Snoop would create magic on screen, but it doesn't. He's a limiting sidekick. One of the most dynamic artists of our time and he's lackluster.Jonah Hill as Lewis Moondog's publicist also isn't very interesting.I get that this movie was about celebrating Key West laid back way of life. The whole idea of tuning out very much exists there lamented among the thousands of tourists but it's not executed well.Zac Efron pops up as a fellow stoner and luckily for him, this performance will hopefully be forgotten seeing that he just turned in a fantastic performance as Ted Bundy.The bright light in this train wreck was Martin Lawrence. Lawrence hasn't made many movies lately. His comedic bone brings much-needed humor to a film that otherwise seemed in slow motion at times.Director Harmony Korine has given us much better work. I understand what he was attempting here, but the bottom line is the movie got stuck in neutral and just became predictable, instead of giving us an insight to a character that is very comfortable in his skin Moondog became a caricature.They're not wrong with going of grind, but a movie requires progression. You know a beginning, a middle and an end. We got two hours of a middle.Matthew McConaughey at this stage in his career should not portray boring characters such as this; however, since his academy award, his roles have been stale. Gone is the young gunner from Texas that shook up Hollywood and in its place an artist that seems to have settled for an easy check. I am not giving up on McConaughey yet, but Beach Bum isn't the way back to memorable.",The Beach Bum

Harmony Korine's film-making style is to create ""experiences,"" shooting music videos in the context of a larger story. This was done with greater success in his previous work, the divisive-but-brilliant-at-times Spring Breakers, and less successfully here. The aforementioned's avant garde style devolves into a more scattershot product in this effort.

145,jroskelley,Happy Medium,5,9 November 2020,"OK. I'll meet the reviews halfway here and give it five stars.To start, this is a great and expected Harmony Korine film. If you are a fan, or even a fan of similar art films that tell unusual stories in unusual ways, you're likely to see the brilliance of this film and story. These are the 8-, 9-, & 10-star reviews and they're legit. I'm in this camp.If, on the other hand, your tastes are more in line with mainstream films and storytelling, this will likely not suit you. These are the 1-, 2-, & 3-star reviews. I get it.Moondog (Mcconaughey) is a stoner replete with some amount of genius, particularly of the literary kind. Sadly, he's rarely taken it seriously.But those paying attention to him, in and out of the film, can see it. It exudes from his every movement, word, interaction, and laugh.He and his antics are accepted by everyone who knows him, which is seemingly everyone in South Florida.His inner circle is his best friend Lingerie (Snoop Dogg), his wife Minnie (Isla Fisher), his daughter Heather (Stefania LaVie Owen), and his agent Lewis (Jonah Hill). They all love and care for him a great deal and are his worst enablers, even his daughter who is the least worst of the lot.Essential, Moondog ambles around the film bringing humor, cheer, goodwill, and a measure of trouble and headaches to everyone.Though appearing aimless, it's the cheer and goodwill that are his true intent, and in that regard he can hardly be called aimless.In the end, is about unfettered hedonism and debauchery, with the peddle to the metal every moment of life.Not for everyone, though I think everyone should see it.

The story has a lot of voids and jumps that could have been avoided to make this a better flix for all of us. The acting is not put into such circumstances where it can actually be questioned and evaluated, but I still felt Matthew and a few others did a great job saving this boat from completely sinking.

As far as I know it's really uncommon to understand the underlying symbolisms of all the chaos, actions and reactions shown in movies by Korine. This isn't a comedy, it isn't fun although it made me smile and laugh a few times. It's sort of a raw depiction of humanity as a whole at its core. Going around aimlessly, breaking stuff, having sex, getting ****faced, lying, cheating and just hanging around while being ""creative"". It's how we came to be and how we will continue to be as long as we all get to keep the right to lead our own lives.Moondog, the guy who has the most and the least amount of problems at the same time, is our protagonist. With that ebb and flow he comes and goes like the waves and tides he sees around him on the beaches everyday.He's become, or always has been, the water Bruce Lee once encouraged people to be. Like water, he's flowing. Unstill even when he just sits on a chair with a cat on his lap, untouchable when having sex and so unrecognizable that he's become one of the most recognized people in the world the movie takes place in. He's the droplets of water carried to us by waves that then flow by and away. It's all so very, very poetic and detailed, painful and colorful it just slurs even the thought. This is Harmony Korine doing again what he's done for over two decades. It's fantastic and terrible, poetic and symbolic, all put into a chaotic mess of a one and a half hour film.The ending is at least nothing less than what I expected. A flame going out with a bang of awe. Nothing more a man like Moondog could've ever been or done. Was it caused by madness? Mourning? Hate? Addiction? Loneliness? Like many things that have happened before, we will never know.What felt out of place however were the shark scene and the blind man driving and flying scenes.

That is good acting.There is one major plot point which gives Moondog purpose, but it's not the central focus of the movie. The movie has no central focus at all.

It's just not constructed conventionally and it's not pared down to the usual act breakdowns with a big climax and satisfying resolution. The plot, such as it is, is secondary anyway because this is more of a character study than a narrative film.Unfortunately, it's problematic to expect a ""normal"" audience to relate to a bizarre character of Moondog because the supposedly great poetry he creates is not actually great. A little interesting, maybe, but certainly not Pulitzer-winning material, and not enlightening in any novel way. This is clear when Moondog recites the superior poetry of others, such as Baudelaire.This movie could only have worked if Moondog's poetry was so incredible we'd love the author despite his numerous social and legal transgressions. That's the only way his life of random drug-induced ""fun"" could possibly seem justified.That said, the film itself is perhaps unintentionally more profound than anything recited by Moondog.

He has absolutely no real feelings for anybody, except say 'his' cat which he basically steals anyway and continues his drug fueled binge even when his wife (Isla Fisher) dies.I absolutely hated this film and I honestly can't believe any of the actors agreed to be in it, I'm guessing they were all high as Moon Dog and that's the only reason to star in such a s*it show of a film.I would've given it a 0 rating but it's not possible, although the film did feature 2 songs by The Cure, so I guess that can merit the 1 rating.",The Beach Bum

The Beach Bum is, by design, simpler than that.What would it feel like to inhabit a world of no consequence? Can it simply be joie de vivre? Can it work? The film's premise is to explore the fantasy of unproblematically affirmative answers to these questions. But there are no winks of irony contained ""within"" this advertisement. Crafting such an ad is a deliberate and conscious exercise, we can all entirely agree on that, but the exercise is precisely to make an ad that in itself is as uncomplicated, as stripped of nuance as possible, played as straight as can be.It would be tempting to point to a certain scene in the movie to counter my point: a moment when an elderly woman on a wheelchair is pushed by Moondog and left to crash against a wall for random fun. One review saw this moment as Harmony Korine being admirably honest about careless hurt and ""showing it how it really is."" The truth is that while my description of the scene is a little graphic, Korine's camera clearly turns away from any damage. The sound mix has absolutely no trace of any harm or pain from the crash and the closeups are of Moondog getting on with things. Yes, we know it's harmful and painful, we've seen it in real life, but the movie is not interested in taking a step back from Moondog's high at this point, or indeed at any point. It tells us in plain words that those poor suckers ""up north on the mainland"" who are not having fun are only needlessly serious. It says it with infectious imagery, poetry and language: They're ""racing to the red line"". They're ""stuck in their ways"". There are no shots of them as this voiceover plays (contrarily to what Martin Scorsese did at the end of The Wolf of Wallstreet when he showed the defeated detective commuting). Here, those other people are not only wrong, they're nothing. What instead is is the nice joie de vivre that would be everyone's if they would just abandon needless worry and get on board with Moondog's way of life.I would say it's as far away from the reality of that life ""how it really is"" as moving pictures and sound on a screen can get. As for being a fantasy, it entirely fails to convince that it has any value.",The Beach Bum

This ""incoherent mess"", actually makes a lot more sense if you're willing to remember a time where you truly let go of the world and the things in it while searching for the meaning of right now, in this moment. I cannot imagine anyone other than Matt McConaughey to take the helm along side a breathtaking Isla Fisher. This movie was exactly what it set out to be, a crude and soft skinned look at the ugliness in life. It served as a great reminder to not hold onto this world so tight because when it's over there's nothing stopping it and the changes that roll in. I hope more people get this movie's message, even though it doesn't make a whole lot of sense at face value, it is about a feeling, a vibe, and a sense of understandable complexity. There's more here than meets the eye.",The Beach Bum
202,alexiosdemos,Film Equivalent of Elevator Music,2,12 June 2019,Painfully unnecessary the movie plays and your mind nearly instantly drifts to your daily routine or the jobs you have to do just like waiting for your floor in an elevator - more like a videoclip that is flatter than stale beer - 2 stars for some of the photography,The Beach Bum
203,corson-54374,Wow! Just Wow!,1,14 October 2019,"How I managed to sit through this horrible movie is beyond me. The cast lineup kept me hoping that somehow a plot will evolve. However there was no plot, no depth, no message and not much work required from the cast. Basically act drunk, act stoned , laugh like an idiot (McConaughey) then collect your pay cheque.
Likely this is the worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years.",The Beach Bum

Walking around looking wasted and dumb for 1,5 hours is not what I call acting. At least there could have been some funny parts, but I could not even have a smile looking at this trash.

The difference is that this movie probably rubs a lot of people up the wrong way because they cannot identify with Moondog while in other movies they would plausibly resonate with the lead actor killing and stealing.Like a modern day Jack Sparrow or Charlie Harper, it depicts a personality, one in a billion, who is allowed to live on fun and happiness with no consequence that affects him negatively. They are able to glide through life in an eccentric and non conventional manner exuberating happiness no matter the circumstance.Very difficult to identify with but very plausible for a person,one in a every billion. Who wouldnt like to be so connected with the universe to blow their own yacht containing $46B cash into oblivion and be happy about it, because they trust in that the universe conspires to keep them happy.",The Beach Bum

I love and appreciate Matthew's outlook on life! Live in the moment kind of movie. Very refreshing in a meditative state of mind sort of way. Even though I don't smoke weed or do drugs I still can appreciate & accept the way people live their lives. This is great insight to a successful mindset. Money isn't everything, but spinning a positive outlook on negative events is the key to true happiness. LOVE THIS FILM & HIGHLY RECCOMMEND TO ALL.",The Beach Bum

Very far from it actually.Poor story, poor message, poor events.I think you're meant to watch this thing while you're extremely high, so it's a shame they didn't just make it into a 30 minutes chill music video, so people could at least enjoy it as a background noise while getting baked.Even though watching it was a very useless waste of time, I still liked the concept about people being accepting and never feeling any anger.",The Beach Bum

Snoop Dogg and Martin Lawerence are also outstanding.Beach Bum seems to get hate by those who are easily triggered or just beta. Sadly, too many have been programmed by mainstream cinema, limiting their ability to process film art that deviates from the intellectually void formula of big studio RomComs. Shame on you for surrendering your autonomy to think for yourself!!

214,fauxbyk,The bohemian code,10,3 February 2020,"I was exposed to beat literature as a disillusioned young man when a four year hitch in the US Marines was coming to an end. With no desire to reenlist or intention to return to my hometown, I adopted the bohemian code I'd become newly inspired by and set out for a home ""on the road"". I indulged in wanderlust, promiscuity, impulsive behavior, and applied a sloppy ""stream of consciousness"" approach to poetry and music. I rejected materialism and imbibed around the clock.What all of us washed up beatniks learn is the lifestyle catches up to you. Sometimes it catches up all at once, or it catches up in a long, dragged out fashion. The point is, it catches up. It is simply not sustainable and the fun lasts only as long as one's stamina (and luck) can hold out. ""The Beach Bum"" poses the question, ""What if the fun lasts, like, indefinitely?""If someone had the physical constitution, criminal aversion to conformity, total lack of self-awareness, and financial means to be a perpetually self-destructive party animal without ever actually self-destructing, that someone would be a lot like the boorish Moondog. Matthew McConaughey delivers a deceptively skillful performance in the title role by incorporating a playful malice (evident in his shrieking, maniacal laugh) to Moondog's otherwise mellow, intoxicated vibe as he spends his days stumbling from one absurd misadventure to the next. He greets each morning impossibly hangover-free and then does it all over again. All the while, his family, friends, fans, agent, and presumably the entire world wait with anticipation to be graced by this ""illustrious"" man of letters with meditations on him.Set in a dark, neon-lit Miami and tiki torch-lit Key West, the Beach Bum is a dreamy, tropical satire. Harmony Korine's tale lampoons the selfish, short-sighted dreams of drunken wannabe literary greats past, present, and future. Just a few of the zany characters who populate Moondog's world are dolphin aficionado Captain Whack (hilariously portrayed by Martin Lawrence), ""Key Largo"" crooner Bertie Higgins, regular jacuzzi fixture Jimmy ""Margaritaville"" Buffett, Snoop Dog as weed-slinging yachtsman ""Lingerie (Ray)"", and an old Rastafarian who pilots his cannabis themed seaplane completely stoned and nearly blind.I believe The Beach Bum deserves a second look from film goers who dismissed it because they thought the character was merely a riff on McConaughey's tabloid persona, or it was a way for the cast to get a paid vacation for their services, or because there is comfort in believing that Moondog and his ilk are safely confined to a time past when society still had enough fringe to allow such rogues to flourish.Or maybe I just took more delight in the comedy than others because it hit so close to home.

Listen, it really depends on many things and that's ok.
If you wanted a laugh out loud comedy, well me too. But good luck finding one these days.
But if you're basing your review on the need for that, well you're not going to like this film.
It isn't a comedy, though there are truly lovingly humorous elements throughout.
This is a film about a man, who writes about what he feels in a way that others deem poetic. Which is in essence poetry. He's giving meaning to elements. To sentiment. To feeling.
Ultimately he feels love, which draws love to him. In wondrous ways.
This is an exploration of a man who does have anything and everything he desires and even when access to those things are seemingly taken away from him through financial restrictions, he shows that money and success are not the things giving access to feeling good.
If you're doing ok in life and you've ""settled"" and you're comfortable and you've accepted this modern way of life and you flicked through some genres and wanted a comedy film to watch, you may have come across this and thought, well it's MM and a few other actors I know, let's give it a watch. You're reading this now wanting to know what others thought- I get that. You may have missed the point of this film. It may have passed you by. And that's ok.
This isn't what you looked for. Or maybe it was. And for that reason is going to be trash or it's going to stir.
For me, the whole point of a movie is to let yourself go for an hour or so and to ponder on life through another's eyes. This did that for me.

221,carlfilm,So bad I wished moon dog had died in the car accident,1,15 June 2019,"This is my first review, compelled to write something as this film was so badly directed and edited, the manical laughing of moon dog through the entire film is cringeworthy, the lack of morality in finding the disabled guy they mugged for his cash , not rescued by the funniest moment when the Jamaican smoking an oversized joint mentioned how much weed he could buy with the cash, I think the script would read way better than it was directed, the performances were ok, I just think the directorship was seriously lacking and it really shows, makes you appreciate Jennifer Saunders writing of abfab , which this film reminds me of, and if Todd Phillips director from the hangover had got involved the script could of been rescued and it could of been a pretty good film.
Trying to make a contemporary cheech and Chong? It's a miss. Portraying a care free poet genius with a zest for life, total miss, moon dog is a happy go lucky character, that is involved in a seedy backstreet mugging? With no consequences? The film jarrs badly at several pivotal plot twists and the character never seems to have too much time to reflect on himself, I think the script and the way the thing got edited are worlds apart, I'll be kind and say the studio got cold feet and cut it together in such a way it came out so far from what the director(who wrote the script) envisaged.

the persona.a beach bum, with the financial freedom to enjoy life.contrary to popular belief, portraying a character like moondog is incredibly difficult to come across as genuine on screen, yet mcconaughey makes it look effortless.for those who aren't aware, this laid back persona dates back to the early 90s with the now cult classic, dazed & confused. look through matthew's discography and you'll be rewarded with gems like this.coming in with the understanding of what this movie is, it does not disappoint. this is one to enjoy, to relinquish your ideals and appeal to the inner self of what moondog represents - enjoying life in your own way.",The Beach Bum

278,librarymovie,The Beach Bum is a story of damnation,8,4 April 2019,"I watched this film in a sparsely populated theater on a Monday afternoon with my buddy- we call him Sauce. When the movie ended, someone sitting near the back of the theater shouted out ""WHAT...WAS...THAT?!"". As if to answer the question, the ""written and directed by Harmony Korrine"" title card popped up at that moment. Sauce and I immediately began to discuss the baffling spectacle that is THE BEACH BUM. The biggest question I had, was 'what are we supposed to think of this character?' After a thoughtful analysis, we have come up with a theory of what is really going on in the film, that also answers the question of what we are supposed to think about Moon Dog.**SPOILERS AHEAD**In a nutshell, the vast majority of the film is a fever dream, taking place as Moon Dog is passed out on his way to his daughter's wedding.Groan! ""Not another one of these theories!""BUT as Major Marquis Warren says in The Hateful 8- it ain't that far fetched... and it's a little mo' than a theory. In a key sequence that the wikipedia plot description doesn't bother to mention, Moon Dog is seen stumbling, pathetically drunk, in the first act of the film. He seriously injures himself on his kitchen floor. Hours later, when discovered, his cuban maid patches him up-good as new,right? Eh, actually Moon Dog continues to drink and do drugs, and he departs for Miami in a hysterical and concussed state.Everything that occurs after this is riddled with surreal elements, which are symptoms of his delusional expectations. The consequences of his actions in the film are false, all part of the delusional fantasy, largely afforded to him by his lavish, unearned lifestyle. In Moon Dog's fantasy, he creates a complex reality where police charges disappear after you unceremoniously accept the Pulitzer prize. A reality where when someone's foot is bitten off by a shark, it's Moon Dog's job to drive the foot to the hospital and hand it to him when the time is right. A reality where his daughter exonerates his horrendous behavior by considering his talent. A reality where Jimmy Buffet is a throwaway side character. A reality where his ""limp-dicked"" son in law never deviates from the narrow viewpoint Moon Dog held of him, and who conveniently is immediately abused and discarded by his daughter. A reality where his wife (who he suspects is sleeping with a mutual friend) quickly dies and leaves him millions of dollars. A reality where his backwards-ass philosophy is rewarded with optimum outcomes.His climatic monologue is the height of his delusion, as he asserts that this carefree lifestyle, wanton disregard for health or acknowledging addiction, is what leads to his greatest art. Understanding this delusion, is key to understanding people who behave in this way, and that is what the core of the film is about. We are all invited into the delusion, and we are all constantly tempted to agree with his philosophy. Are we supposed to instantly forgive and enable him, like his wife does? When there's always something charming about his next action, it's easy to forever give him a pass on throwing a wheel-chaired elderly woman into a wall at high speed, right? Nevermind that sometimes he hangs out with sociopathic, violent muggers, because we'll get back to Snoop Dogg soon. Jonah Hill's line about the best part of being rich, that couldn't be a hint towards the entire point of the movie... could it? As if the hints couldn't get more subtly overt, we then flash back to the clip of Moon Dog rehashing his crappy poem to a disinterested crowd, the moment where he assures everyone-""that's good poetry"".At the end of the film, Moon Dog shows his resolve by carelessly destroying his fortune, assured that the universe is protecting him. In an almost (or incredibly) surreal fashion, the blazing bills rain down upon the partygoers at the beach. Moon Dog sails away with his feline friend, happier than any other protagonist at the end of any other story. I believe this marks the end of his delusional fantasy, but if you remember- this is not quite the end of the film.The film then fades to a different scene, Moon Dog returns to his standard lackadaisical life. Floating in his red boat, lounging around in an extended camera shot, before fading to black.Now, credit where credit's due, my buddy Sauce is the one who noticed the key element that allowed us to put all of this together so quickly: In the final shot of the film, Moon Dog no longer has the cat, AND was in the same boat in which he haphazardly operated as he embarked for the wedding. In the final shot, he wasn't exactly going anywhere. He didn't have two girls cuddling him. He didn't have giant blunt. He was very still, and the boat was just drifting in the ocean. It then fades to black, in a film that is clearly is expertly using film devices to clue us in to additional layers.Conclusion? Moon Dog died. Suddenly, the conversation under the surface of the film emerges. Loading your body with substances for decades doesn't produce your greatest artistic work, it destroys your mind and body. And as with many celebrities who came before this film, this poisonous philosophy led to his untimely death. Sadly, he took his delusion with him up to the very end, which is why I said earlier that THE BEACH BUM is a story of damnation.",The Beach Bum

289,natelongenecker,This was surprisingly brilliant.,9,15 April 2019,"I'd normally be snobby about this type of film but I was genuinely blown away by it's complexity and deliberateness. I don't like writing reviews, but felt the need to balance things out with a quick positive take.Some takeaways (spoilers):
This is a surrealist, illogical story full of illogical scenes and absurd pacing. But I'm pretty sure this is on purpose. You'll notice throughout the film characters often exchange one fluid conversation in multiple locations or from multiple angles. What we are seeing cannot have literally taken place, but we're given an idea of the feeling of it - and it's more entertaining as a result. This is not unlike Moondog's perception of is life. Many of the stories he tells are clearly untrue, and he romanticizes the hell out of any tragedy in his life, often overcome with laughter at the lowest of lowest. He is selfish, delusional, over-romanticized, and self-destructive. For him and for us as the audience, the truth is less important than hearing a good story.
If you look at the actual events that take place in the film, you understand it to be a tragedy. Yet Moondog is laughing the whole way through, and we are at least chuckling every now and then (I'm not gonna tell you this movie will crack you up, although I definitely did), giving us the impression of comedy. In reality, Moondog found his wife to be cheating on him, then lost her to a car accident, then worked to earn the $50 million from Minnie's estate only to blow it on a wild night, leaving him with no real friends other than his daughter, no money, no boat, and no soulmate. Yet that's not how Moondog chooses to see it. You may respect him for his positive outlook on life, or you may be disgusted by his selfishly-driven denial and avoidance of consequences at all costs - both conclusions remain equally likely.
I understand why you may not like this movie. It is oddly paced, surreal, and destined to be occasionally offensive regardless of who you are. In many ways it feels like nothing happens, but I think if you're into trying to understand characters and themes there's a lot more there. With that said, if that's your type of thing, you may love it like I did.",The Beach Bum

308,bornios,A philosophical trip about the sense of life,9,23 April 2019,"Moondog is a real slacker that lives from day to day smoking weed and celebrating the simple things in life. With his aloha shirt, long hair and his off one's trolley style he seems like a spin-off to the Big Lebowski. Matthew Mcconaughey plays excellent the main character Moondog. High class acting like he has waited for this role his whole life. Harmony Korine's new movie The Beach Bum is filled with crazy hilarious figures who look like they arose from a hallucinogenic trip. Well that's actually the main topic of the movie. Everyone is smoking weed and celebrating the excess.
The excess is an important element of most of Harmony Korine's movies. As in Spring Breakers the characters seem to live only for parties, drugs and sex. In colorful pictures, with an amazing cinematography by Benoit Debie Moondog goes through an odyssey where he tries to define his own sense of life.
The Beach Bum is a very poetic movie. Like an essay it projects the thoughts and feelings of the protagonist on the screen. Between the lines of the funny and grotesque dialogues and actions of the characters there hides a deep philosophical meaning. Thinking about the sense of life it defines a simple answer to what are the most important things to become happy and live completely free.
When Moondog lies on the beach, sleeps with lot of women or invites a group of homeless people into his house to destroy the furniture he lives his personal freedom. Moondog is the personification of everyone's deepest wishes. A scream for breaking out of our structures and with rules imposed society. He is the rebel who, as his wife Minnie, played by Isla Fisher , says 'lives in another dimension'. Moondog looks like a modern prophet, trying to spread his message of a free easy-going life, which is defined by his literary work, he publishes.
The Beach Bum is a real cinematic trip and an intelligent view on the absurdism of life underlined with fantastic actors (Jonah Hill, Snoop Dogg, Zac Efron, Martin Lawrence), beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack that transforms every scene into a magic unforgettable moment.",The Beach Bum

313,jmjosmak,Beached Bummer,1,20 August 2019,"After sitting through this vile, despicable, idiotic garbage I felt angry. Why angry? Perhaps because this movie addresses the concept of the free spirit while lacking the intelligence, let alone humanity, to do anything but rub excrement on it.Perhaps I'm angry because this movie takes an honorable stock character of our culture, the brilliant, tormented writer with a select following-the ""voice of his generation"" type-and turns it into a moronic burlesque of impulses too vulgar to merit examination. But examine we must, as pathologists studying how bad a bad movie can be.Mathew McConaughey is about as convincing portraying a brilliant tormented literary light as Carrot Top would be playing Abe Lincoln. After great work in True Detective and Tiptoes it's dismaying to watch Mathew sink so low. He takes a ""voice of his generation"" genius figure and turns it into a mindlessly swaggering frat boy, smirking his way through one stupid depraved act after another. But in all fairness, all he has to work with is the putrid script consisting of Harmony Korine's puerile ravings.Wanton acts of cruelty to strangers are presented as bold realizations of sincerity, the free man's self-actualization. That's license, not freedom. It creates its own sort of jail. With rights come responsibilities.The script doesn't come close to being funny because the writer is too dumb to think of anything remotely clever.Snoop Dog is even tainted by Beach Bum's rancid swill. It brought out a thought that I thought I'd never think: Snoop Dog, you're slumming.But the biggest reason I felt angry after watching this insultingly stupid obscenity? It gives Hawaiian shirts a bad name. Yes! Hawaiian shirts! I love Hawaiian shirts. I own nine of them myself. In my Hawaiian shirt I celebrate summer and the prospect that life can be beautiful. And I live it with the merciful notion that while enjoying life's beauty I don't have to take things so seriously. Hawaiian shirts stand for generosity with the joy of living. That's a deeply humane sentiment, isn't it?McConaughey wears Hawaiian shirts throughout Beach Bum. The day after I watched it I went out in town wearing one of my Hawaiian shirts. I felt self-conscious all of a sudden. Am I like this rotten character? No! But could my shirt be seen by others as my support for the insupportably disgusting idiot at the center of this terrible movie? I felt sick.The cure was to watch a beautiful movie, The Descendants, directed by Alexander Payne. Clooney wears Hawaiian shirts very well. And if I may indulge the reader, in the scene where Clooney refuses to sign he wears a shirt that I once had, 20 years ago. The exact same shirt, exact same print! Though now long lost in some laundry room, my memory of that shirt helped me identify even closer to the character.And watching a great movie is a cure for the suffering inflicted by a terrible movie.
After that I once again proudly sported my Hawaiian shirt, putting Beach Bum behind me. Forever.",The Beach Bum

If you are a stoner you will probably enjoy it, but I gave that up in the 80's and grew a brain. I guess the moral of the movie is enjoy life, money aint gonna make you happy blah blah but jeeze you dont need to watch 2 hours of Mathew trying to be funny and driviling on.

333,thatsmarvelous,Don't demand refunds from theaters just because you didn't like the movie you saw.,6,12 June 2019,"First off, I just want to get my opinion of the movie itself out of the way; I actually didn't hate this movie and find it kind of hilarious how angry it's making some people. I laughed, but that's just me. Humor is very subjective. I think this has the potential to become a cult favorite among the stoner/college kid crowd once time goes by and it's viewed by more people.Honestly though, I mainly felt compelled to write this review because of the person who wrote the review that said ""so bad I had to ask for a refund!"" For god's sake, don't ever be that guy (or girl, it's just a figure of speech). There are several valid reasons to ask a movie theater to refund your ticket: for example, if there's a problem with the projector and they're unable to actually screen the movie. Your opinion of the movie itself (which, may I remind you, is YOUR opinion, is subjective, and may not be shared by all or even most other people) is not a valid reason. The theater's employees performed their job exactly as they were supposed to, and it is not their fault that a team of people from Hollywood made a movie that you didn't like. It's also not their fault that you chose to buy a ticket for that particular movie (as opposed to any other current movie), which presumably you did because some piece of advertising for the movie gave you the impression you might like it. You made a gamble on whether or not you'd like the movie, and as Billy Bob says in Bad Santa, ""they can't all be winners, can they?"" Don't take away from the theater's livelihood (which is already a pathetically minuscule cut of the ticket price) because of this. If you absolutely CAN'T live with the fact that you wasted your precious ten dollars, I would MAYBE say it's acceptable to ask the staff if they'd be willing to just allow you to switch out your ticket for a different movie that same day (I still think this would be a LITTLE obnoxious, but it's as far as I'd be willing to compromise on any of this). Or, if you feel you were misled by the advertisements or something, why don't you try writing a firmly-worded letter to the studio that made the movie? Who knows, they might actually be accommodating enough to send you the refund. I've heard George Clooney will do this if you tell him you paid to see Batman and Robin.Also, the theater employees don't need to spend their time listening to you complain on and on about how much you hated it either. You may think you're having an annoying day, but when all is said and done, you're the one who's currently having a leisurely time out to the movies on your free time, and they're the ones who are currently at work. However stressed you think you are, I guarantee AT LEAST one thing's probably happened to them at that job that's stressed them out about 100 times more, and having to listen to your privileged ass trying out your Roger Ebert impression for 20 minutes is just rubbing salt in the wound of having such a thankless low-level job in the first place. If you want to vent, write a review here on IMDb or a similar website, or call up your friends. The theater employees have actual work that they need to be doing, and again, at the end of the day you're still the one who's currently getting to enjoy the feeling of not being on someone's clock.I've never even worked at a movie theater, but I've worked my fair share of minimum wage/service industry jobs, and it just astounds me how entitled and out-of-touch people can be. And above everything I've already said here, you're also lucky enough in the first place to live in a country that has things like nice movie theaters with air conditioning, and to be able to afford the luxury of having the free time and money to go out to them. Quit being a diva.",The Beach Bum

After the scene where a homeless man just wearing an adult diaper jumps into a pool, I'd had enough. This movie has no emotion, no soul, just a clueless, self-absorbed stoner with zero self-awareness. Quite literally, half of the movie is just scenes of Matthew Mcconaughey smoking weed and cigars. Gets one star for a decent soundtrack.",The Beach Bum

If you are familiar with Harmony Korine's previous work, you know what to expect.It's a trip. McConaughey's performance is wild. There are also some memorable cameos from some other great actors (standouts being Zac Efron and Martin Lawrence). Best watched drunk...or stoned...or in my case both.",The Beach Bum
