0,TheLittleSongbird,Running out of luck,3,11 November 2018,"It took me a while to get round to watching 'Leprechaun' and its numerous sequels, with so much going on and having a long watch and review list. Why were they seen in the first place? Mainly for curiosity to see whether they were as bad as reputed or whether they would fall into the guilty pleasure category. Also appreciate horror, and ones with splashes of comedy, and had gotten into watching a few horror franchises that had interested me for a long time.Watching 'Leprechaun', while understanding why people would find it a guilty pleasure it didn't do it for me. Being someone who wanted to go against the consensus on this front, as it did have a good concept and that it had talented Warwick Davis involved going for it, it does genuinely regret me to say that. Didn't think it was that terrible and have seen far worse films, but found myself agreeing with the criticisms it had, and still has, directed at it and thinking it a bad film.Davis is the best thing about the film. He is both amusing and creepy and does do the best he can, successfully, with a goofy look, terrible lines and less than tasteful horror which must have been hard to do and shows how conscientious and talented he is. Pre-'Friends' Jennifer Aniston is likeable enough as pretty much the only tolerable character in the film, and that is saying a lot.There are sporadically mildly amusing moments that don't come anywhere near enough. It starts off relatively unsettlingly, again not enough to be a redeeming quality.On the other hand, the rest of the cast is risible. On one side of the acting spectrum there is a completely lifeless and uncomfortable-looking male lead performance from John Sanderford. On the other there is Robert Hy Gorman in for me one of the most obnoxious child performances ever. Mark Holton's attempts at humour also grated, so much so it was very difficult to sympathise with him considering the character was disabled. The characters display very little personality when they aren't being insufferably annoying with their dumb antics and illogical decision making.'Leprechaun' is severely lacking in the script and story departments. The dialogue is so childish and repetitive as well as heavy in the cheese, nothing is funny and any attempts at humour or playfulness are forced. Having gratuitous gruesome gore was not enough to cover up for the complete lack of scares and suspense, nothing bit my nails, nothing made my heart pound or skip, nothing made my palms or forehead sweat, nothing made me jump. It's not just because it is so intelligence insultingly dumb, excessively predictable and unintentionally comical, it's also because the second half especially drags so much, is so uneventful and so repetitive and anything trying to be scary on top of being un-suspenseful and gratuitously gory suffers from tastelessness (the silver shoe buckle laceration especially).In conclusion, bad in almost every way. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Leprechaun
1,Leofwine_draca,It's the pits,2,16 August 2016,"Whoever thought up the ludicrous premise of this dire movie deserves to be exiled from the film industry for good. A telling example of what's wrong with the modern horror film, LEPRECHAUN forsakes chills and thrills in favour of some moronic humour which fails, time and time again, to be the least bit funny. I don't want to sound like an old misery, but this is such a total failure that I can only marvel at what on earth the people who made this were thinking of.There are so many faults that I don't know where to begin. For a start, the music is uninspired. The acting is basic and amateurish, especially in the case of the muscular male lead who is devoid of both charisma and talent. This plank's idea of acting is to limp exaggeratedly through much of the film with a tiny bite on his leg which Bruce Willis would have forgotten about five seconds after it was inflicted. There's an annoying, foul-mouthed and snot-nosed kid who thinks he's the bee's knees, who has a dim-witted friend who tries to be funny but fails every time. Just wait until you see the 'heartfelt' scenes between these two as the kid promises to ""fix"" his friend's slow brain... sickening, indeed! The cast is packed with unfamiliar faces, apart from a then-unknown Jennifer Aniston, who has of course gone on to bigger (and more lucrative) things with the hit sitcom FRIENDS.Under a rubber mask (I hate to think of how much he was sweating here) is Warwick Davis, the hero of WILLOW, as the leprechaun of the title. He's an extremely irritating creature who runs around singing rhymes and going on about his gold, which gets boring after about two minutes. Davis goes completely over the top and is literally grating on the nerves, an obnoxious, stupid monster who enjoys making those Freddy Krueger-type puns so fond of modern scriptwriters (I hate 'em). I saw him once at a movie convention, didn't seem too happy and if he's in junk like this then I know why. It's fun to sit back and name all the films that this one rips off. I spotted CRITTERS (the setting), THE SHINING (leprechaun on tricycle), and most of all THE EVIL DEAD, with P.O.V. shots of the leprechaun chasing Aniston, severed hands running about, etc.The gore in this film sits uncomfortably with the humour which occupies most of it. It feels like a family film, except for the odd occasionally violent moment like when the leprechaun rips a corpse's eyeball out to substitute for his own, or breaks a man's neck with a loud twig-snap noise. These effects are okay, but stick around and you'll witness some tacky green glowing computer effects which show the leprechaun's ""magic"". The film reaches its low point with the leprechaun riding a skateboard, or wheeling himself along in a wheelchair with the film sped up. I know exactly the kind of person who would find this stuff funny, and it's totally atrocious. Astonishingly, numerous sequels have been made to date, probably even worse than this one. I have seen worse films, at least this one is full of action to keep the viewer's mind off things. Just try watching something like SHRIEK, a new low. Don't think of this as a recommendation though, avoid LEPRECHAUN like the plague.",Leprechaun
2,SnoopyStyle,campy horror not scary,3,24 October 2015,"Dan O'Grady returns home after stealing the Leprechaun (Warwick Davis)'s pot of gold. The Leprechaun stowaway in his suitcase. Armed with a pistol and a four leaf clover, Dan is able to stuff him in a crate. He suffers a stroke before he can set it on fire. Ten years later, J. D. Redding rents the rustic O'Grady farmhouse and his materialistic daughter Tory (Jennifer Aniston) wants to leave immediately. After meeting hot handyman Nathan Murphy, Tory changes her mind about the house. Tory, Nathan, his little brother Alex and idiot friend Ozzie have to battle the violent dwarf who is searching for his gold.This is extremely cheesy. The Leprechaun costume looks ridiculously campy. Being scared of a four leaf clover makes him look really silly. The whole thing is one big joke. Jennifer Aniston does look good but that's the only redeeming quality. It's a horror that is more likely to make you laugh at its silliness. Although, actual attempts at humor are too stupid to be funny.",Leprechaun
3,nogodnomasters,LESSER OF THE HORROR CLASSICS,8,15 May 2019,"The Leprechaun series followed on the successful series of Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare. Like its predecessors it combined horror and humor. Leprechaun challenges our long held views of Leprechauns and turns them from a simple trickster into nearly immortal vile murdering creatures with all kinds of magical powers that would make you wonder how they ever get caught.Leggy Jennifer Aniston plays a city girl who has moved into the country. She loathes the ""new"" house until she meets a hunk who is going to paint it. Her lines are well written, and her delivery is less so. Inside the house is a trapped Leprechaun and somewhere on the grounds is his hidden pot of gold. The writers did a good job creating humor and Freddy style dialogue, but they over did it to the point it distracted from the horror aspect from the so-called ""horror"" movie. The character Ozzie, a mental midget, was also a bit over done.The movie drops the f-bomb and is perhaps the most memorable line, ""F-you Lucky Charms.""",Leprechaun
4,gavin6942,"Cheesy, But Still a Part of My Childhood",6,20 October 2010,"Ten years after the previous owner suffers a stroke, a man and his daughter (Jennifer Aniston) move into a North Dakota town. But in the basement is a nasty little creature, a leprechaun, who will tear you apart if you have even a single piece of his gold.This film will be remembered for its promotion of LA Gear shoes, the feature film debut of Jennifer Aniston and being the first film released by Trimark. (Trimark released a ton of horror films, and not surprisingly was later merged with Lionsgate.) The movie suffers from a ""poorly written story"" and a ""clumsy introduction"" according to Mike Mayo, but he may be too hard. The film is clearly not intended to be taken too seriously, with its bad humor and the weird shoe fetish that the leprechaun has.Is this film good? No. But it's not terrible. And if you grew up in the VHS video age, where every week you were renting bad horror films from the video store, this was a part of your upbringing (along with the countless sequels... each one worse than the last).",Leprechaun
5,lee_eisenberg,The Irish really are the greatest storytellers in the world!,10,4 February 2006,"Attention all ye Americans and English! We - that's the wee people for those of ya that don't know - want to tell ya about the time when one of ours had an encounter with Jennifer Aniston. I know that you Americans think of her as the woman on ""Friends"" or as Brad Pitt's ex, but it was a fine job she did here. She must have the luck of the Irish! Anyway, ""Leprechaun"" portrays a bunch of modern-day people getting chased by one of ours. FYI, the title character was played by Warwick Davis, who also starred in the ""Harry Potter"" movies, and even appeared in ""Ray"" as a man whom Ray Charles met in Seattle.An' can a humble Irishman like me make one last request? You Americans need to get over the Brad-Jennifer breakup! There's more important things in the world!",Leprechaun
6,jboothmillard,Leprechaun,2,8 October 2018,"It was a DVD called Ultimate Boogeymen - The Killer Compilation that I first found out about this scary movie and its leading villain, then I watched the interview of the leading actor with Jonathan Ross and found out more about its sequels, my predictions of what the films would be like were pretty much correct. Basically Daniel 'Dan' O'Grady (Shay Duffin) has returned to America from Ireland after stealing 100 pieces of gold from the magical and nasty Leprechaun (Warwick Davis), but he manages to trap him in a crate covered with a four-leafed clover, before suffering a stroke. Ten years pass, J.D. Reding (John Sanderford) and his spoilt daughter Tory (introducing Jennifer Aniston) move in to O'Grady's old house. Three painters: Nathan Murphy (Ken Olandt), his brother Alex (Robert Hy Gorman) and their dim-witted friend Ozzie (Mark Holton) arrive to fix the house up a little. It is Ozzie that accidentally releases the Leprechaun, hearing voices, the creature threatens to kill him if he doesn't get his gold back, but luckily his powers are weak. Ozzie tries to convince the others what he saw, but they obviously don't believe him. Then he and Alex spot a rainbow, Ozzie wants to follow it, convinced there should be a pot of gold at the end of it, sure enough they find a bag inside an abandoned car. Ozzie accidentally swallows one coin, they hide the rest, and take one to a Pawn Shop Owner (John Volstad) to see if the gold is truly valuable. The Leprechaun appears shortly after they leave and kills the collector to get his first coin back, before returning to the house to terrorise the others. One by one, they realise that a monster is after them, but they still refuse to believe Ozzie that it is a leprechaun, with it biting and scratching them with its sharp teeth and claws. Tory decides to go and get the rest of the gold to give back to the creature, she retrieves the bag from the well where Alex and Ozzie hid it, she gives it to the Leprechaun and runs back into the house, but the creature is angered when he only counts 99 coins. With the Leprechaun still causing terror, Tory goes to see O'Grady at the hospital to find out how to stop the Leprechaun, she does eventually find him, hanging and bloodied inside an elevator, before dying he says they need to find a four-leafed clover. Tory returns to the house and tells the others they to search the clover patch to find one with four leaves, but the Leprechaun continues to appear, demanding his last coin back from inside Ozzie's stomach. Finally, Tory manages to find a four-leafed clover, Alex attaches it to a piece of chewing gum and manages to shoot it with his slingshot into the Leprechaun's mouth, it gags green blood and deteriorates until he falls into the well, which is blown up by gasoline and a lit match. Also starring Pamela Mant as Mrs. O'Grady, William Newman as Sheriff Cronin and David Permenter as Deputy Tripet. Davis has said he jumped at the chance to play Leprechaun, having been in nice things, like Star Wars as Wicket the Ewok and in Willow, to show he can diversify, he certainly relishes being the mischievous Irish monster, taking time to polish and tidy up characters' shoes, making cheeky quips and talking rhymes; as for Aniston, who was cast in Friends a year later, she continually denies any connection with the film whatsoever, which is understandable, but she is reasonable in her first lead role as the feisty heroine screaming and running. Apart from Davis and Aniston, the acting is terrible, especially Holton, the dialogue is dreadful, the special effects makeup is fine, but other effects don't do anything, and the story is rather predictable and silly, it is cult favourite, I will admit there was a small part of me watching that had some fun and giggles, it is one of those ""so bad it's good"" experiences, but it is a lacklustre horror comedy. Pretty poor!",Leprechaun
7,BA_Harrison,Warwick Davis gets top billing over Jennifer Aniston—it's a crazy world we live in.,5,20 May 2012,"Leprechaun is a light-hearted slice of tongue-in-cheek horror that stars diminutive Warwick Davis as a malevolent, magical Irish fellow who will go to any lengths to get back his hoard of gold, which was stolen from him a decade earlier. It's all very silly and 'one-note', the entire film consisting of the creepy little leprechaun terrorising and killing those who he believes to have his treasure. Plot development is virtually non-existent, and things unsurprisingly become rather monotonous and tiresome, with very little in the way of genuine scares or decent gore to excite fans of the genre.Good job for me, then, that the female star of the film is a young and very hot Jennifer Aniston: I'm an Aniston fan (despite films like The Bounty Hunter seriously testing my devotion), and the lovely actress's presence makes the film easy to endure long after the leprechaun's shenanigans have become extremely tedious. Sadly, Jennifer does not take a shower or have a sex scene (a woeful oversight—this is a cheesy horror film after all), but she still looks fantastic throughout, running around in a pair of tight shorts, with frequent shots of her magnificent butt to compensate for the lack of blood, guts, and a decent plot.I rate Leprechaun 5/10, mostly for the delectable Ms. Aniston.",Leprechaun
8,paul_haakonsen,A terror 2 feet tall...,4,1 April 2012,"From 1993? Hmmm, when I watched this movie, I could have swore it was like watching a horror movie from the late 1980's.Now the term ""horror movie"" here is used fairly reluctantly, because ""Leprechaun"" is bordering between horror and comedy, in some weird hybrid form. There are moments where you are thrilled and feel the rush of adrenalin, but then the movie takes a turn and turns to goofy comedy. But oddly enough, it works out well enough. Perhaps because of the nature of the leprechaun itself.There were some lovely bloopers in the movie. I liked how the leprechaun was able to turn over and make the pick-up truck roll around by driving into the side of it with his small toy car, that was just hilarious. And also when the leprechaun was taunting the humans by driving by on a skateboard in the hallway repeatedly, the shotgun blasts missed him every time, but made no damage to the wall or items behind him.As for the acting in ""Leprechaun"", well I think that most people actually did good jobs with their given roles, and taking the nature of the movie into consideration. Of course, it is not award-winning performances, but still worth the effort to sit through.I bought parts I and II on Amazon and am actually looking forward to seeing part II now with some odd excitement. Might get the rest in the series as well. Despite being so campy and cheesy, there was just something about it that still worked out well enough.",Leprechaun
9,Quinoa1984,it skims that line between being a bad exploitation flick and an uproarious horror-comedy movie with glee,6,31 January 2007,"I wont ever get anything worthwhile as far as true scares with Leprechaun. Maybe if I were younger the effect would be with a stronger, stranger response, because the make-up- which is extremely well-crafted- and the un-hinged demented brilliance of Warwick Davis could be creepy for a kid. As an adult, however, a LOT of this is quite silly, the kind of flick that might've been presented as the St. Patrick's Day special on the grind-house circuit back in the 70s. Which means that what it lacks in any sort of quality and carries with idiot characters, it does a good enough job of making up for it as a comedy. There's next to no real character development at all, but who needs with then with a little green man running around...excuse me, riding around (on a variety of little goofy vehicles). The writer's make a self-conscious effort to make it in a predictable style, at least at first (they also waste no time getting to the Leprechaun at the start). The director Mark Jones makes shallow attempts for 'different' angles at times (lets do a quick tilt here, a little extra grand-guignol there), but it's really the Warwick Davis show at the end of the day, and the crazy situations that come out of his dogged attempt at one thing- his pot of gold! A funnier side too is just suddenly seeing the name Jennifer Ansiton in the opening credits- a first time acting job that feels very much like one. She and the rest of the main human characters are pretty standard as somehow able enough to stay on their toes with such a wretched little s.o.b., but it goes without saying you'll come across the very inane dialog exchange or just tepid moment of ""acting"" (Mark Holton as Ozzie is an example of this). Meanwhile, the Leprechaun rides his tricycles and scooters, and sometimes runs like hell (in truly over-the-top action sequences), and its usually a gas if not entirely workable as horror. Whatever cheap thrills do come around, its never anything totally exciting. But I wouldn't trade some of the Leprechaun's classically mad turns of phrasing (""This old Lep, he played one. He played pogo on his lung""). That little near 4 foot ball of comedic bravado makes the picture somewhat memorable, and I'm sure I'd have fun again watching it again some time soon. Cleverest bit of old-time cliché logic: the Leprechaun's ability to talk in other voices ala the Terminator as a trick on those around the corner. 6.5/10",Leprechaun
10,Coventry,"Well, Top O' the Mornin' to Ya, Lad!",6,19 November 2008,"I felt quite astounded and even a bit embarrassed upon noticing that I still hadn't had a user comment submitted for this 'childhood-favourite' of mine. Here I am writing down junk for more than 2000 films, yet I always overlooked the one film I watched and enjoyed numerous times as a young and over-enthusiast horror fan. ""Leprechaun"" was one of the easiest horror films to rent as a kid  it's really more of a comedy - and we wanted to watch it for Warwick Davis' pleasantries instead of to see what pitiful sins Jennifer Aniston has committed before moving on to the huge success of ""Friends"". Heck, we didn't even know who the hell Jennifer Aniston was back then and for all we cared she could be just a pretty face never to reappear in another movie ever again.""Leprechaun"" is an incredibly silly, incoherent and nonsensical movie but it nevertheless guarantees some harmless and completely stress-releasing chuckles. The make-up effects are delightfully cheesy and Davis' typically Irish Leprechaun character is an inventive and engaging horror villain. He's everything you heard or read in children fairy-tales: he drinks, he sings, he brags with his hat and the buckles on his shoes, he has an obsession for gold, he fanatically polishes shoes and speaks Irish with the most irresistibly authentic accent. The Leprechaun was trapped in the basement of a ramshackle house for more than ten years. The new tenants (among them Jennifer Aniston) accidentally set him free and he promptly goes looking for his stolen pot of gold, not at all remorseful about having to kill anyone who stands in his way. In spite of the ""normal"" sounding horror plot, ""Leprechaun"" is an overall ludicrous movie. The rotten-teethed midget kills victims with a pogo stick and grotesquely chases with toy cars and tricycles. But although the emphasis clearly lies on comedy, the script nonetheless showcases some occasional flashes of mild suspense as well. For example, the sequences where the Leprechaun impersonates the voice of a crying little child in order to mislead his opponents are reasonably creepy! I've never seen any of the many sequels (Leprechaun in Space??? Leprechaun in the hood??? What the hell!), but I never grow tired of the original. It's pure guff, of course, but very relaxing guff!",Leprechaun

A demonic little Irishman(Warwick Davis) wreaks havoc in a small town in North Dakota when his golden coins are disturbed. Pretty lame, but decent for late late night viewing.

13,Hey_Sweden,I want me gold!,5,6 February 2013,"Say what you will about the absurd low budget ""Leprechaun"": the concept has been durable enough to create a series that has kept actor Warwick Davis gainfully employed. It's extremely ridiculous stuff, and is certain to have people rolling their eyes at all times. That said, writer / director Mark Jones *knows* his film is daft, and refrains from ever taking it all that seriously. That can only be a good thing. Davis is a total hoot in the title role, a demented, ugly little Irish beast who is swindled out of his gold and locked inside a crate for 10 years. After that time, he's unleashed and causes all sorts of trouble for a limited number of people. There's Tory (a dues paying Jennifer Aniston, pre-""Friends""), a spoiled and stuck up California gal who moves with her father to North Dakota, and a trio of locals - Nathan (Ken Olandt), his younger brother Alex (Robert Hy Gorman), and their simple minded friend Ozzie (Mark Holton) who has the incredible misfortune to accidentally swallow one of the Leprechauns' prized gold pieces. The diminutive little creep kills a few people along the way, but the body count remains low; this isn't that much of a horror film, but does work if one accepts it as a very dark comedy. There is a certain appeal in watching the enthusiastic Davis appear to have a lot of fun, as he fires off some zingers and takes delight in terrorizing the unwary. Aniston is good in her role, and gives us plenty of eye candy shots of her gorgeous gams. Olandt, Gorman, and Holton are all likable enough. The special effects are agreeably cheesy, and Gabe Bartalos's makeup for the Leprechaun is impressive. All in all, this is definitely good for some laughs and silly touches (death by pogo stick!); the movie has the feel of a cartoon at times. Some genre fans might dig it. Five out of 10.",Leprechaun
14,poolandrews,"""Try as they will, try as they might whoever steals my gold won't live through the night."" Entertaining horror.",7,19 December 2005,"Leprechaun starts on one dark night somewhere in North Dakota on the O'Grady farm as Daniel O'Grady (Shay Duffin) pulls up outside his house in a chauffeur driven limo, his wife (Pamela Mant) gives him some ear ache about it but he tries to reassure her with a far-fetched sounding tale of how he caught a Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) in Ireland & took it's pot of gold thereby making him a wealthy man. However this particular Leprechaun is an evil little bugger who wants his pot of gold back & will use his magical powers to regain it. The Laprechaun kills Mrs. O'Grady & tries to make Daniel tell him where he has hidden the gold but Daniel manages to catch the Leprechaun in a crate & seals it with a four leaf clover which will prevent the Leprechaun from escaping... It's now '10 Years Later' & the O'Grady farm has new owners, a city slicker named J.D Redding (John Sanderford) has brought the isolated farm & intends to move in with his daughter Tory (Jennifer Aniston) but first he needs to clean the place up so he hires Nathan (Ken Olandt), Ozzie (Mark Holton) & a young boy named Alex (Robert Gorman) to give the old property a new coat of paint. It's not long before Ozzie is tricked into removing the four leaf clover & thus releasing the Leprechaun who wants his pot of gold back & a bit of fun in the process...Released into theatres on the 1st January 1993, making it the first film released in '93, Leprechaun was written & directed by Mark Jones & I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually liked it on a dumb mindless level, it ain't art but it is good fun. The script by Jones moves along at a nice pace & thankfully never takes itself seriously which leads to a few fairly amusing moments. It seems pretty obvious to me that the filmmakers were intending to create a franchise with a recognisable wise-cracking invincible anti hero who the audience root for more than the human character's, considering since Leprechaun was made back in '93 there has been a fairly steady stream of sequels which currently number 5 & counting they didn't do too bad a job... Another thing which makes Leprechaun quite fun & better than the usual teenage horror crap is that the character's are actually likable, I especially liked the dialogue between Tory & Nathan. Various scenes & ideas come from Irish folklore such as the Leprechaun itself, the four leaf clover, the shoe cleaning thing & the pot of gold. On the negative side it's rather silly at times (check out the car the Leprechaun builds himself & a scene when the Leprechaun is zooming around in a wheelchair) & doesn't have any depth to it.Director Jones doesn't give the film any real style but it is competently made throughout. He blends horror & comedy with a fair degree of success & the Leprechaun himself is quite a cool horror character, he's certainly an ugly little git. He also manages to make time for the expected Lucky Charms cereal gag as well. The violence & gore isn't overly graphic or gratuitous & somewhat restrained, someone gets a bite on his hand, someone is killed with a pogo stick, the Leprechaun has his hand severed which starts crawling around & he melts at the end.With a supposed budget of about $900,000 Leprechaun is technically fine & nothing springs to mind as being either particularly bad or particularly good, except the clover patch at the climax which is achieved by shining a green spotlight onto the ground! Now onto Jennifer Aniston, this was her first theatrical feature film & she does OK while at the same time I have to admit I rather fancied her in this. Everyone else does fine & the young kid wasn't too annoying.I am somewhat surprised that I enjoyed Leprechaun as much as I did, I think it makes for decent entertainment & is good fun as long as you don't take it too seriously. Certainly worth a watch.",Leprechaun
15,Calicodreamin,"Ef you, Lucky Charms!",4,3 April 2021,"Leprechaun is so bad it's almost good... almost. The script is particularly bad, dialogue is disjointed and one liners seldom work.

16,Boba_Fett1138,Great fun with Warwick Davis.,7,7 July 2010,"This is of course a real ridicules movie. Just look at its concept of a killer leprechaun, chasing those who steal his gold. But the movie is all about the entertainment it provides. It earned this movie and its sequels a bit of a cult-following and made it a fan favorite. It certainly doesn't deserve its low rating on here.The movie is not really a gory, scary, serious horror, unlike its cover might suggest. It at least doesn't put its emphasis on its horror. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it more of a fun and comedy like one, in the same style as movies such as ""Critters"", Tremors"", ""Ghoulies"", ""Gremlins, etcetera.It's the silly concept that makes this movie fun but also every other element surrounding it like the characters and acting. Looked like Warick Davis had lots of fun playing the character and many people don't seem to realize what a great actor he actually is. He plays his evil, murderous character, fun and with class. His accent is great and he also gets helped by some good looking make-up effects. Jennifer Aniston makes her cinematic debut with this movie and its quite an amazing fact that so many now well known actors once made their debut in an horror film. She also really shouldn't be ashamed of it, since she does a good job in this good movie. Her comedy talent was also certainly already showing.There is still some gore and some of the other typical horror elements present in this movie but this only keeps the movie an horror-comedy rather than purely a comedy. Everything in this is being steered toward some comedy but fans of purely horror will also still get their kicks out of it. They will enjoy this movie most likely, just like everyone else would probably do as well. I'm sorry, I just can't see how anyone could not enjoy this movie, simply for what it is.Great fun first entry into the long series of 'Leprechaun' movies.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Leprechaun

This was a meager meal of such foul taste that I forced myself to eat half of it out of courtesy and deference to Jennifer Aniston.An ugly leprechaun is after his pot of gold and he'll kill to get it. If that premise sounds bad, well seeing that premise in action is worse. I was curious and a wee bit excited when I saw Aniston's name. All I can say about her appearance in this movie is that you gotta start somewhere.",Leprechaun
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Really fun and cheesy effort,9,19 July 2016,"Traveling to a family-owned farmhouse, a teen and her friends inadvertently free a deadly leprechaun stored away who begins to terrorize them looking for his stolen gold coins they've found and forces them to fend off his attacks in order to leave.This one wasn't all that bad and had some good parts to it. Among the film's better elements is the fact that there's a modicum of suspense attempted here during some of the stalking scenes, keeping this one a lot more serious than expected at times. The the prologue encounter in the house during the driving thunderstorm is a prime example of that kind of creepy encounters while the tormenting done on the police officer in the woods is just as much fun with the twisted game of hide-n-seek in the rather creepy location before getting to the final twist. The house assault is even more fun with them coming back to find the mess which shows that someone's in there with them, the quick pop-up attacks to torment them as he comes out of the cupboards or begins running through the house to get at them as they continuously fail to stop him from getting in close quarters for some brutal attacks. The complacency attempt is really fun as well as once he finds what he believes to be a ruse he launches even more rather brutal sequences as he traps them inside the house in some really enjoyable features here that all piles together into the film's highlight scene. Even the finale offers up some fun with the battle in the clover patch and getting in the actual method for dealing with the creature really gives this some high-energy action to end this effectively. This is nicely boosted by the cheesy parts here in the shop owner's encounter or the chase around the retirement home that's quite goofy and cheesy, while his constant quips and limericks all round out the different attitudes here which are all fully employed here to give this a lot to like. As the kills here do get somewhat bloody and creative, there's some great positives her to make this enjoyable enough to hold it's own from the few negatives. The main issue here comes from the cheesy side of the film which isn't really depicted as scary or thrilling as instead it's more goofy than anything which isn't exactly an appreciative tone for these kinds of films. There's another small flaw is the relatively few kills here which manage to really drag the first half down by holding off the kills and tricks until the second half. It's all that really holds this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Leprechaun
19,HotToastyRag,Real cheesy,2,12 June 2017,"Leprechaun was one of those awful, campy horror movies from the 1990s that everyone saw and no one wants to see again. It spawned a chain of even worse sequels; the original is really only memorable because it starred a pre-FRIENDS Jennifer Aniston. No one who saw this movie would have guessed the brunette barely-pretty teenager would become the most popular actress in America.I guess if you really want to see her before her glory days, you can rent this one. Or if watching really cheesy horror movies during Halloween is your thing. Other than that, it's definitely one of those movies you can get away with pretending to have seen by just rolling your eyes at the mention of it.If you do like the Leprechaun franchise, there's a quadruple feature on Amazon for your enjoyment on Halloween or St. Patty's.",Leprechaun
20,Wuchakk,"Somewhat amusing horror/comedy with Jennifer Aniston, but too much filler",4,11 June 2016,"Released in 1993, ""Leprechaun"" is a low-budget horror/comedy about a father and daughter (John Sanderford & Jennifer Aniston) who move to a small, old house in North Dakota where they and some painters (Ken Olandt, Mark Holton & Robert Hy Gorman) encounter a devilish little leprechaun obsessed with his pot of gold coins (Warwick Davis).I've only seen the first four Leprechaun movies and this is easily the least of 'em. While the cast, locations and leprechaun are good there's only enough material here for half the movie's runtime, like maybe 45 minutes. The second half goes on and on with the leprechaun's zany antics and attacks on the cast. Being low-budget, the location is limited to the ranch house and a couple of visits into town, such as the hospital and diner. It just gets monotonous and there's simply not enough to keep the viewer's interest. The next three movies make up for this by changing the location and upping the ante with the entertainment on all fronts. ""Leprechaun"" is worth seeing, particularly to catch a glimpse of young Jennifer in her first theatrical movie, but it's humdrum after the first 40-45 minutes and nothing exceptional up to that point. The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Saugus, California, near Santa Clarita.GRADE: C-",Leprechaun
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,I'm still laughing on the floor!,7,24 November 2003,"Leprechaun is actually, in my opinion, a fun horror movie with great comedy and some spooky scares. I know that this movie is beyond silly, but I think sometimes you need a villain that doesn't take himself too seriously, this movie made fun of leprechauns along with making it into an interesting horror movie. Come on, you have got to admit that that little leprechaun was one scary looking creature! Warwick Davis is just so awesome, I don't get how you could not love him, or be scared of him as the Leprechaun.Leprechaun is about a daughter and a father move into an old house where the previous owner has gone insane and trapped a leprechaun in the house they moved into. The one thing that is keeping the leprechaun in the box is a four leaf clover. Jennifer Anniston in one of her earliest roles is a prissy Beverly Hills girl who meets Nathan, a hunky carpenter who is helping them out with the house, and his two friends Ozzie, a mentally challenged man and his little brother, Alex. When Ozzie goes down to the basement, he accidentally knocks the clover off the create, the leprechaun escapes! He also wants his pot of gold that Ozzie and Alex found and will kill to get it! I know there are some major cheesy scenes, but they are just so laughable, you know, like the so bad it's good type of thing? I think that's why Leprechaun is a cult classic and a guilty pleasure for most. You just need to have fun and not take it so seriously as a horror movie. Warwick Davis is just a great leprechaun and he made it into a fun franchise! 7/10",Leprechaun

23,sddavis63,How Did This Give Birth To So Many Sequels?,4,21 October 2010,"There's no doubt that the Leprechaun character and series turned into a pot of gold for actor Warwick Davis, who played the murderous little creature in this original movie followed by something like 5 sequels. The question is: why? I'll grant that this isn't a horrible movie. I've seen a lot worse over the years. Mind you, I've seen a lot more better movies. The story is given away by the title and the title character. He's a leprechaun searching for his pot of gold, and quite willing to take out anyone who gets in his way to do it. Although it has a few scenes that are a little bit suspenseful, when you're just not quite sure if, where or when the leprechaun is going to pop up, for the most part this came across as silly rather than scary. There was some potential. The whole idea of a murderous leprechaun is interesting (folklore has them as mischievous but not murderous) and as far as I can remember there haven't been many depictions of the creatures in the movies, but this whole movie was characterized by a ridiculous quality weighed down by frankly sub-par performances.I watched this mostly out of curiosity about seeing Jennifer Aniston's first movie role. As far as I'm concerned she hasn't really changed much in the intervening years. She was OK but struck me as a bit lightweight, certainly lacking any truly weighty screen presence.How this spawned all those sequels is beyond me.",Leprechaun
24,lost-in-limbo,"Just give him his gold back, PLEASE!",3,12 December 2005,"A leprechaun is accidentally freed from his crate and from this moment onwards he terrorizes a household while searching for his gold that was stolen from him. He punishes any unlucky individual who hinders his relentless search of his gold and it up to some teens/kids, Tori, Nathan, Ozzie and Alex to survive to the devastation that this pest is causing them and find the only weapon that can protect them from this malevolent nightmare.Straight to the point you want? Stupid and unfunny! Yeah 'Leprechaun' is a woefully dull horror flick that leads to spiteful violence with an underbelly of hokey humour, which is unbearably painful. Well, it was for me! I was thinking to myself while watching it, why am I putting myself through a second viewing. Simple, I thought maybe during my first viewing I took it the wrong way, but honestly this time it wasn't any better. Maybe I need to be drinking a lot and I MEAN a lot of alcohol, to find something amusing about it. Because this could have been a great twisted fairy tale nightmare, but it's a nightmare for all the wrong reasons! You might call it more a black comedy than horror, but I believe it didn't work either way. Actually, I thought it opens rather well, but then not too long it falls away quickly. Becoming nothing but a one-idea joke that's filled with too many awful one-liners and wise cracks, which was an uphill struggle to sit through. Sadly all the effort went into the nasty side of the effects, which isn't too bad as the makeup of the leprechaun was excellent and the gore didn't disappoint. But I was just having a hard time with the supposed humour (more like childish), lousy thrills, annoying editing and uninteresting characters. These things bothered me more than the obvious horror clichés, predictability, no frights and that there's not even a real story backing all this up. The acting was average to say the least, though Jennifer Aniston's presence shows and keeps one watching. Warwick Davis as the Leprechaun was obviously enjoying himself by pulling out countless bad-lines. While, the dialogue was just plain nonsense. Almost everything misses the point. Maybe it was a missed opportunity, or I'm just fooling myself. The more I think of it, it felt like I was watching a more nasty version of 'Critters', from the people being under siege in their house and how much do I hate those films, maybe with the exception of the original.What were the distributors of the DVD I own were thinking? The thing is they got a pretty recent picture of Aniston from her 'Friends' days and stuck it on the original poster art for the DVD cover. Gosh, I don't remember her being on the original cover art. Who's the actual star of the show? Were they thinking that putting Aniston on the front that it would sell by the truckload? *Hmm* I guess that would help, as there would be more fans out there of Jennifer Aniston who might be a tad interested and who most likely skip it not knowing she was in it. I might be talking crap and moved totally off the point, but I just found it an interesting side-note.It's definitely not worth its weight in gold!",Leprechaun
25,bowmanblue,"Hardly horror, but watchable nonetheless",7,7 August 2014,"If you ever wondered what Jennifer Aniston did before she hit the big time in 'Friends' then you should watch this. Apparently, she got chased around by nasty little Leprechauns.'Leprechaun' is classed as a 'horror,' but I'd be surprised if there's anyone out there who actually finds it scary. It should probably be described as a comedy. The titular character is very tongue-in-cheek as he chases a bunch of hapless kids around a farmhouse one night, in pursuit of his lost gold coins.That's all this film is - a chase. The Leprechaun is unstoppable (at least via conventional means - the kids will have to learn exactly what magic way you can despatch a Leprechaun), so the monstrous little fella is happy to just keep messing with their young heads as he terrorises them. This is perhaps the film's only real drawback. Although it's not overly long (ninety minutes), the middle part seemed a little too drawn out. Yes, we get that the Leprechaun can't be killed, so they really need to move it along a bit.However, that's a minor gripe. Yes, this film is a typical low budget B-movie, so don't expect much in the way of acting (although Jennifer Aniston shows she has what it takes to do more than just scream in hotpants). If you want a silly, cheesy B-movie to laugh at then you'll find one right here.",Leprechaun
26,ericstevenson,At least Jennifer Aniston didn't play the leprechaun,3,26 July 2017,"This marks the beginning of one of the worst film series ever made. Both this website and RottenTomatoes have these installments as some of the worst movie series of all time and it's not hard to see why. It's really amazing how powerful this leprechaun is. When looking at slasher movie villains, I'm not kidding, this guy has killed more people than any other villain who talks! Yeah, even more than Freddy Krueger! His total count is 45 and Freddy's is 42! I guess the reason the character isn't more popular is because of how stupid he is. This movie is also Jennifer Aniston's film debut.Yeah, I doubt she looks back at this role in pride. The only reason I didn't give this less than a 3/10 is because it did make me laugh with how utterly stupid it was. Also, from what I've heard it's at least not as bad as the many sequels, which I'll unfortunately get to eventually. This movie features a mass murderer leprechaun who wants all his gold coins. That's really all you need to know. Even being melted at the end doesn't kill him off! Well, his closing narration assures us that he'll unfortunately be back. This leprechaun can literally teleport, reform, mimic other voices and flip a car over. He's that powerful! *1/2",Leprechaun
27,ironhorse_iv,This movie's luck just ran out.,5,17 March 2013,"People ran out of the theaters door because Leprechaun is just awfully bad. The movie is full of camp and moronic shenanigans characters that makes your head ache. This movie isn't a pot of gold. Leprechaun leaves a pot of unlucky poo. How it did it even get a green light? Leprechaun always struck me as a parody of the horror genre rather than a serious attempt at being a legit horror film. The thing is the deaths are not comedic enough nor the puns were funny. The movie starts out with what else a Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) chasing after a man Danny Boy O'Grady (Shay Duffin) who stole his pot of gold while a trip to Ireland. The Leprechaun somehow got to America without getting explain. You see that a lot in the film. If he can jump around using magic, why does he need a pogo stick, a tricycle, and kiddy cars? He manage to get around using magic in some scenes, but rarely used it at all. He hides in the weirdest places too like suitcases, safe locks and freezers. The man manage to capture the Leprechaun with a four leaf cover and trap him inside a crate. Rather than finishing him off, he buried his treasure and suffers a stroke. I don't know why he didn't kill him after the stroke, but just go with it. Ten years has pass and the house is getting repainting by a group of painters known as the Three Guys who Paint made out of Nathan Murphy (Ken Olant), his little brother Alex (Robert Gorman) and their mentally challenged friend Ozzie Jones (Mark Holton). Mark Holton plays the character as if like Lenny from Of Mice and Men, but it's hard to see when the other characters are just as stupid as he is. Jennifer Aniston spits out some of the stupidest lines ever heard in this film. The new owner of the house Tory Redding (Jennifer Aniston) finds out that the painter Ozzie have allow the Leprechaun to break free from his crate by knocking off an old four-leaf clover off the crate that trap him. Now the owners and the painters must find a way to stop the Leprechaun before he ends up killing them for his gold or shines all their shoes. Jennifer Aniston is just awful green as an actress here, as I believe it was her first starring role. She doesn't delivered. It's like watching Ross on screen here failing. The make up on Warwick is great, but not really scary. His acting was cheesy, but fine with the B horror role he got here. Reminds me of a pre Lord of the Ring's Gollum. He's like Gollum. He just wants to have his Precious. The plot doesn't make sense, if a freshly plucked four leaf clover stops him. Then why did the old four leaf clover trap the leprechaun for ten years? I don't even think the movie even research anything about Irish's leprechaun folklore. Depending who you are, some Irish people can find the popularized image of a leprechaun to be little more than a series of offensive Irish stereotypes. The script has some of worst diologue in film, top off by a cheese out one-liner by the child Alex in the end of the film to sum up what the audiences were thinking after seeing this movie. Don't get me wrong. The movie has the feeling, it's 'so bad it's good' sort of way. That makes it kinda entertaining. For that matter, this movie got sequels. Awful sequels that didn't need to be made. I guess if horror movies is even mildly successful, the producers doesn't care how silly it gets, they just keep making them. Good watch on St. Patrick's Day if you were really bored as hell, or have a thing for wee little people, but the best of luck for you if you do watch it. You need it.",Leprechaun

Did I mention bah their rhyming jokes? Pretty entertaining, their jokes.
If caught by humans, they grant 3 wishes but if anybody steals their gold, they hunt em down.
Dan O'Grady, wasn't aware of all this. He returns home to US after stealing gold coins from a leprechaun during his trip to Ireland.
We are not shown their confrontation or how he managed to rob the leprechaun but the creature followed him home.
O'Grady managed to lock him in a trunk with the help of a clover leaf before suffering from a stroke. Fast forward ten years, a father n daughter plans to move in the house of O'Grady.
I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs n had actually enjoyed the humor. Had zero idea about Jennifer Aniston those days.
Revisited it recently since I am planning to watch the two new ones n going on a leprechaun film series marathon.
The film hasn't aged well but some of the jokes r still laughable.
The hospital scene is creepy. But again how come ther is absolutely no other neighbours around the house, nobody in the hospital,
the stupid cop keeps running in the woods, the guy keeps on shooting the leprechaun inspite of knowing its supernatural powers, the clover leaf staying at one place on the trunk for ten years, Aniston looking beautiful n fresh after continuously running here n there, etc.
It has some gore n few kills. The leprechaun after losing his body parts, takes body parts from other human bodies, remember Jeepers Creepers? Also the look, especially the hat n face of Jeepers is taken from Leprechaun.
It has one eyeball horror scene for fans of Fulci. Another one in part 3.",Leprechaun

The storyline focuses on a house historically owned by an Irish Family who stole gold and trapped a leprechaun in the basement. After the old couple move on, new home owners acquire the house and accidentally unleash the leprechaun. The leprechaun is on a mission to uncover his gold and will kill anyone who gets in his way. This movie is directed by Mark Jones (Rumpelstiltskin and NightMan) in his directorial debut and on a $900,000 budget. This picture stars Jennifer Anniston (Friends), Warwick Davis (Willow), Ken Olandt (Summer School) and William Newman (The Craft). This movie is a perfect blend of comic relief and fun kill sequences. The movie doesn't take itself seriously at all and does a good charm of working everything in from Lucky Charms to boot cleaning. Loved Warwick Davis as the Leprechaun, perfect choice. Overall this has some cheese in it, but it also has a red hot Jennifer Anniston and some clever script writing and special effects execution.

37,MBunge,Only passable in comparison to the multitude of similar movies which totally suck ass,5,27 June 2011,"This goofy horror-comedy isn't very good but it isn't very bad. It mixes a little bit of Nightmare on Elm Street and a smidgen of Sam Raimi with storytelling that's about a subtle as a kick to the crotch. If you can stand looking at the atrocious, brightly colored outfits that look like leftovers from the 1980s, you might like Leprechaun.The film begins by telling the story of how Irish drunk Dan O'Grady stole a pot 'o gold from a Leprechaun, moved away to North Dakota only to have the ugly, magical bugger follow him and demand his gold back. Using a four leaf clover, which this story contends is the leprechaun version of garlic to a vampire, O'Grady traps the wobbly killer in a crate in his basement. He has a stroke, however, before he can destroy it. That's almost the plot for an entire movie on its own, and it all happens over the opening credits.10 years later, spoiled Los Angeles girl Tory Reding (Jennifer Aniston) and her whipped father (John Sanderford) move into the O'Grady house with the leprechaun still crated in the cellar. They're joined by a trio of house painters - Nathan (Ken Olandt), a side of beef with a poufy hairdo; his bratty little brother Alex (Robert Gorman); and the portly and mildly retarded Ozzie (Mark Holton). The leprechaun breaks out and spends the rest of the film tormenting Tory and the painters, until she goes to see Dan O'Grady at a rest home and learns the secret of how to destroy the Irish mini-monster.This is an intentional comedy but most of the intentional humor is quite lame. It largely consists of Warwick Davis making unfunny quips and director Mark Jones putting his little person star into a string of ridiculous situations. We see the leprechaun on a tricycle, a pogo stick, roller skates, a skate board and he even chases Tory through a hospital in a wheel chair. There's almost a poor man's Loony Tunes quality to some of it, such as when the leprechaun crashes through a fence and leaves a hole that's a perfect outline of its body. And then you have the little guy's shoe-polishing compulsion, which leads to him being distracted by footwear being thrown at him.Jennifer Aniston is the standout of the cast, unsurprisingly, but you'd never have predicted she'd go on from this to become one of the most famous and successful actresses of her generation. There's probably been at least a hundred other young women who looked as good in a hundred other low-budget pieces of schlock. Warwick Davis as a shrunken mix of Freddy Kruger and a Pit Bull acts his heart out, but he's given material that would barely be funny to a 6 year old. This cheaply made diversion made enough at the box office to spawn a series of increasingly ridiculous sequels, and I can understand why. Leprechaun is a good concept for a horror-comedy and this first film is pretty competently made, with only a few moments of head slapping stupidity. It's never that good, though, leaving you laughing at the movie instead of with it. On the grading curve of horror-comedies, Leprechaun comes out a little above averagebut that's a really out of whack curve due to how many attempts at this sort of thing are utter failures.",Leprechaun

I always find it difficult to review movies like this, not because they are bad per say, but because they are bad and I do quite enjoy them. It's far from the worst film i've seen, far from the worst horror even, and it's corny antics and horribly written dialogue and storyline do make for quite a bumpy ride. However, despite all the reasons you should hate this film, it still manages to put a smile on my face, and made me laugh out loud several times throughout. It's truly a bizarre kind of film, with a plot so ridiculous that you can't help but have fun with it. It's cinematography can be awful at times, we get a weird amount of butt shots, and the special effects are anything but impressive. The film steals many little parts from other horror films before it. The acting is horrendous, and its characters poorly written, but it still has some sort of charm, no pun intended. In the end, Leprechaun is not a film for serious movie goers, but for those looking for a uniquely awful but fun film to watch around this time of year, Leprechaun can certainly be a choice for you.

41,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Fun Creature Feature,7,7 July 2019,"This was a film that I know I saw once while growing up. I think I've caught scenes here and there, but I can't recall if I ever saw it again. On top of that, I might have seen the sequel before this one to be honest. This is definitely a fun film that really embraced what Freddy became with the comedy. The synopsis is an evil, sadistic Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) goes on a killing rampage in search of his beloved pot of gold.We start this film with the Leprechaun coming down some stairs in its hideout. He has a pot of gold and is running his hands over it. It then shifts to a house in the middle of the country. We come to find out this is in North Dakota. Dan O'Grady (Shay Duffin) is dropped off at his house by a driver and his wife, Mrs. O'Grady (Pamela Mant) is scolding him. He reveals that he has found a pot of gold and took it from a leprechaun. She doesn't believe him and Dan cracks open an urn where he smuggled it into the country with. Mrs. O'Grady goes into the house and hears a child crying. She opens Dan's suitcase and the Leprechaun emerges. He pushes her down the stairs to the basement and Dan comes in. He ends up getting the creature into a crate and uses a four-leaf clover to keep him there. He tries to set it on fire, but has a stroke.The film then shifts 10 years into the future. We have Tory (Jennifer Aniston) with her father J.D. Reding (John Sanderford). He purchased the house that belonged to the O'Grady's to fix it up. Tory gets spooked with how dirty it is and wants to leave. That changes though when she's mocked by Nathan Murphy (Ken Olandt). She changes her mind to prove him wrong. Nathan is there with Ozzie (Mark Holton) and Alex (Robert Hy Gorman) to paint the place.Things take a turn though when the crate is opened by Ozzie. He sees the Leprechaun, but he can't stop Ozzie as he's been locked up all that time and without his gold, he's lost his magic. No one believes Ozzie about what he saw. They do see a rainbow and Ozzie wants everyone to find the end of it. He goes off and Alex follows. They end up finding the satchel of gold that Dan hid. Ozzie tries to bite a coin, like he saw in the movies. He ends up swallowing it though.There are some odd things happening, like the Leprechaun rubbing Tory's leg from under the truck. When she goes to look, it scratches her. Her father goes after what he thinks is a cat and it bites his hand. The Leprechaun follows them into town, wanting to get his gold back. He will kill anyone in his way to do so as well.Now this film isn't great. That's not to say it isn't good, but I just want to temper your expectations if you've never seen this. The premise is actually pretty solid though. I love the idea of taking this mythic creature and making it vicious. It is interesting, because growing up there is obviously the cereal Lucky Charms, where the leprechaun there is nice version. This one most definitely is not.This film does do some really good things. Having seen some of the sequels as well, I know that this series has some of the worst continuity out there. They really don't even try if I'm going to be perfect honest. Being this is the first one though, I like what they set up here. The Leprechaun has magical powers and I really like that being locked up and not having his gold has rendered him pretty much powerless. The only thing he has is that conventional weapons hurt him, but will never kill him. He needs to get his gold in order to become magical again.I also like that they incorporate so much of the mythology here. I like that he is easily distracted by shoes, as he is a cobbler by trade. There are four-leaf clovers. The outfit that he wears is pretty great as well as it is quite authentic.This film is actually pretty progressive as well. Tory tells of Nathan who is trying to reinforce gender roles. She tells him that it is the 90's and that women can make their own decisions. I completely agree here, but it is interesting though that this is relevant and something we're seeing quite a bit in the news at the moment. This film being 25+ years old and it is still an issue.I'm not the biggest fan of horror/comedies. It really takes a special one for me to be on board. I will say that I love the rhymes that the Leprechaun does. Davis really kills this role and it kept him working for most of the 90's thanks to the sequels to this one. His performance as the creature is great. This film is over the top at times, but I will say that they blend it pretty well with the horror elements.Since I already covered Davis' performance, I might as well move to the rest of the acting. I did bring up that Aniston is in this film. She isn't great, but you can definitely see that she has talent here. She is still gorgeous to this day and it is great to see her when she was just breaking into acting. I thought Olandt was solid and he plays off Tory well. Holton is great as the dimwitted friend. He is pretty funny at times and I also like Gorman. He plays a character who is still a kid, but pretty wise still. The rest of the cast does round out the film for what is needed.To the pacing of the film, I don't really know if it builds tension as well as it should. I think a lot of that is due to the comedic elements here. Like I did feel that the characters were in trouble, but they're able to flee this house multiple times while the Leprechaun is there, even with its full magic back. I did like how it ended though and I thought that was a good touch with the mythology.Next to the effects of the film, which I thought were good. They went practical for most of it and I think that works. The blood looks good and I think the wounds that are inflicted on people are as well. The only time that went with computer graphics would be for some of the magic and I honestly thought that looked good. I really didn't have any issues here and I think the film is also shot well.Now with that said, this is a fun film. I don't want you to come in expecting too much as this is a film that I think works well to have some buddies over and a couple of drinks. It is outrageous, but there are some deeper issues here that are still relevant today. I like the mythology they used and incorporating that. They do ground the powers of this creature, which I think works. The acting from Davis is great and he actually made me chuckle with some of his lines. It is fun to see a young Aniston and the rest of the cast is fine. The effects in the film are good and its shot well. The soundtrack really didn't stand out to me, but I think the use of sound effects helps make some scenes creepier. The Leprechaun can mimic animal noises and people's voice which can be scary. Overall I'd say this film is above average.",Leprechaun

Must have seen some of them as bartenders or guards in other films.The whole movie was the family running away from the leprechaun. Not much of a story, but It was fun to see Anniston.

43,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Leprechaun vomit,1,2 May 2012,"In this cinematic equivalent of a pot o' mould, a mangy leprechaun is after the blockheads that stole his bag o' gold on a small farm. Why do I call them blockheads, you might wonder? One of them sticks his bare hand into a dark hole in the ground, searching for what he believes is a cat, which has just violently scratched Aniston's character. Surprise of surprises, it is really the leprechaun, and he violently bites the guy's hand. There is also a Kevin Bacon lookalike, a Joe Besser lookalike who swallows a gold coin, and a little kid who appears to be playing a role meant for another idiot adult. The film is unscary: are we supposed to be scared when that little bell starts dinging all by itself, and the ominous music begins playing? This is also unfunny: are we supposed to laugh when the leprechaun rides around in that little toy car for a considerable amount of the film's run time? Warwick Davis is amusing to a point, but the character of the leprechaun is too cruel to watch after a while, and the attempts at humour fall flat, partly due to bad writing and partly, again, because the character is so unlikable. Jennifer Aniston is cute in the film, this was back before she played a dateless 30-something woman searching for Mr. Right in 200 films. Everything else about this long-shelved film (which was filmed in October and November 1991, unreleased until January 1993) was terrible. It was too cruel and malicious for its own good, and the comedy wasn't good enough to compensate for its needlessly mean-spiritedness.I watched this on late night cable television, as a double-feature with Dr. Giggles. At least that one didn't suck quite as badly as this does.",Leprechaun
44,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Leprechaun""- An oft-misunderstood and genuinely entertaining horror-comedy that's just a bit rough around the edges.",6,17 January 2017,"One of the most genuinely jarring and confusing things in the world of film is the shocking amount of people don't ""get"" the highly entertaining but problematic 1993 release ""Leprechaun."" It's honestly dumbfounding. The movie is constantly tossed around by wannabe- elitists like a joke, while they scoff and smirk while quipping ""How can a movie about a killer leprechaun be scary?"" It's the go-to every single time someone tries to put together a list of bad horror movies. And it's generally looked down on as a complete and utter failure due to lacking any real thrills or shocks and having such an inane concept.But honestly... How do people not understand that this is a comedy? It's a movie about a wisecrack-spewing, psychopathic leprechaun, for god's sake! It's most well-known sequel takes place in ""tha hood""! If your tongue is not planted firmly in your cheek, you're not watching it correctly.""Leprechaun"" of course follows an evil Leprechaun (played delightfully in campy performance by Warwick Davis) who sets his sights on a young woman named Tory (Jennifer Aniston) and a group of contract workers lead by Nathan (Ken Olandt), who are fixing up the farm house where Tory is staying with her father for the Summer. Obsessed with getting back his pot of gold that was stolen by dim-witted contractor Ozzie (Mark Holton) and his 12-year-old friend Alex (Robert Hy Gorman),the leprechaun starts to pick off townsfolk one by one in a bloody and hilarious war to get back what is rightfully his. And so our heroes must band together and try and solve the mystery of where this little green menace came from... and how to stop him once and for all!Written and directed by Mark Jones, the film is genuinely quite funny at times and has a really light tone. He keeps the humor flowing quite well, and even when the film tries on occasion to throw some actual scenes of horror at the audience, it never goes too far. Jones' characters are quickly defined and are endearing enough to make you want to root for everyone's safety. The dim-witted Ozzie in particular is very likable with his innocent heart and good intentions, and you'll definitely also get a kick out of the foul-mouthed young Alex for sure. For being such a low budget release (rumored to cost less than a million dollars), the production is also relatively stylish and there's some nifty effects and adequately revolting sequences of blood and gore to keep the horror crowds happy.The cast is a lot of fun. Warwick Davis is just perfect in the role of the devilish bundle of terror, and you can tell he's having an absolute blast with the part, hamming it up just the right amount and throwing in plenty of amusing wisecracks. There's a reason the character became so memorable, and it's Warwick's dedication to the role. Aniston charms in her first major starring role and she's very decent in her performance. You can definitely see hints of her immense talent that would later be showcased in more major roles in the future. Ken Olandt is good as Nathan, and although his character is perhaps the most stock, he is well cast and definitely enjoyable. Mark Holton and Robert Hy Gorman end up nearly stealing the show, however. As I mentioned above, Holton is very likable as Ozzie and he's easily the most endearing of our four lead protagonists. And Gorman is a very good child actor and he gets some really fun zingers.However, despite competent direction, great characters and genuinely decent performances, the film does have some big problems that knock off major points. Even though the film is clearly trying to be comedic, it can't quite settle on the proper tone during some key scenes. It occasionally feels a bit too juvenile in some scenes, while feeling a bit too mature in others. It also really gets bogged down in the third act, having to put too much focus on resolving the story and tying up loose ends. It ends up losing that sense of spunk and lightness that made the first two acts so entertaining- to the point that it just stops being fun for the last twenty or so minutes. I also do think that a few of the ""horror sequences"" feel a bit out of place and conflict with the style established in the rest of the movie. They don't go too far, they just feel a bit inorganic.As it stands, ""Leprechaun"" is not a great film. But it is a decent bit of fun. It's constant lambasting at the hands of harsh critics and harsher audiences is very unfounded, and it seems that far too many people are not in on the joke of it all. This movie isn't trying to be a great cinematic experience in horror... it's a quirky, comedic bit of insanity with some good laughs and one or two genuine creeps thrown in for good measure. And for my money... it's the best killer- leprechaun movie out there.I give ""Leprechaun"" an every-so-slightly-above-average 6 out of 10. If you happen to catch it on TV, definitely give it a watch. Just know enough not to take it seriously.",Leprechaun
45,MartianOctocretr5,O'Campy and McSilly but wee bit of the funny,4,11 September 2006,"Utter nonsense, but fun nonsense. Warwick Davis made this deranged plot a camp riot, and Jennifer Anniston makes a good shrieking target victim.The rest of the cast are not very memorable, except they kept rehashing the same ""Lucky Charms"" jokes. Some guy with a predictably low IQ swallows a gold coin (!) belonging to a leprechaun who wants it back. That's the whole plot. That's it. The leprechaun hobbles around, searching for his beloved coin, and knocks off a few extras who get in his way.It bogs down in places, especially with the ""nobody believes there's a monster"" clichés which are a staple for this kind of movie. Extra legends about 4-leaf clovers are thrown in at random to provide for a resolution. But who cares; you're laughing too hard at how stupid the whole thing is, anyway. My favorite goof is how the house is supposedly long-deserted, but is fully stocked with groceries, naturally including a certain cereal. The cast all seems to be having fun, probably between acting gigs when they had nothing better to do.For a cheap laugh only. Turn the brain off. And be careful not to eat any gold coins.",Leprechaun

Revisiting it so many years later I still think its lame, i just have grown to enjoy the cheesiness of it. Starring a young and charasmatic Jennifer Aniston (Friends). The film centers on a small group of strangers who get attacked by the title creature and discovering his gold. Things play out with as silly childlike flair as the evil leprechaun played by a wonderful Warwick Davis (Willow) taunts them and does things like polish shoes, rides skateboards and so much more. The kills are creative and fun and the film aims low and mostly succeeds.3.25/5",Leprechaun
47,one9eighty,A pot'o'gold,5,7 August 2015,"Warwick Davies in his finest horror role as the Irish (but occasionally with slightly cockney accent) blood thirsty, gold coin loving, magic wielding, shoe shining, lucky charm chasing, rainbow loving Leprechaun menace. The story is thus, Dan O'Grady returns from Ireland where he claims to have captured a Leprechaun and won his gold. Thinking he can retire with his wealth he returns home to the USA but the Leprechaun wants his gold back and follows him. The start of the film is in essence a scene setting flashback, it shows how the Leprechaun gets trapped in a box by O'Grady which gets sealed with a four-leaf clover - a Leprechaun's natural enemy of course. Flash-Forward 20-30 years and the house where the Leprechaun is trapped has been sold, the previous owner (O'Grady) has been put in an OAP home as he's old now and has never been the same since the stroke inflicted on him magically by the Leprechaun at the end of the flash back sequence. J.D. has bought the house and along with his spoiled daughter Tory (Jennifer Aniston) the plan is to renovate the house and live in it. Misadventures of the young people lead to the Leprechaun being released to hunt for his gold no matter what happens to the people in his way - as it happens his pot'o'gold has been re-discovered at the end of a rainbow. Blood, guts, shoe-shining and a tricycle chase sequence are only part of this films (lucky) charm. As the film reaches it's climax it's a battle of good vs Leprechaun, who will win?!This film isn't really a horror movie like it promises, the action is weak, the acting is poor, the dialogue is almost embarrassing at times but it's still very entertaining above all! A lot of people I know who have seen this compare it to other 90's horror however I don't think it's fair, this is more a horror movie in the sense of it being like a ""Carry on"" movie, occasionally camp, occasionally tongue in cheek but as far from being serious as can possibly be. Now I know what you are wondering, does the Leprechaun win or lose? Spoiler alert) Come back for my review of ""Leprechaun 2"" to find out.",Leprechaun
48,TOMASBBloodhound,Still the best film Jennifer Aniston has made. Seriously.,6,16 March 2008,"Just the basic concept of this film and its title character alone deserve some props. What a wicked and funny idea for a low-budget horror film. How it has led to so many sequels is still a mystery, but the original is a site to behold.Warrick Davis, perhaps the best-known ""little person"" in the movie business, plays the title character of record. He's an evil, disgusting, yet very resourceful little monster who simply wants to keep his gold. Early on we are introduced to an Irishman living in America who has just returned from the old country with a bag of gold that he proudly shows his wife. He tells her he trapped the Leprechaun and made him tell him where it was which apparently every leprechaun must do if he's captured. How this frail old man was able to capture this dangerous creature is not explained, but soon the man realizes that it isn't wise to steal gold from this particular leprechaun. The little beast kills the man's wife before he can lock him up in a crate where he will remain for the next ten years. It is then that a father and daughter along with three house painters unwittingly let the little guy loose once again.Davis is a howl as the ferocious little creature who just wants his bag of gold back. A young and incredibly hot Jennifer Aniston plays a young woman whose father has just purchased the old house where the leprechaun is waiting in his crate. The rest of the cast is basically unknown, but they do fairly well with the material. I think the studly house painter guy was the stripper in Summer School. And the guy who plays the father used to be on Saved By the Bell.The film is not really scary, but it has a silly relentlessness that makes it more than entertaining. There is some gore, and some cheap special effects. I guess what could we expect for a budget of $900,000? The film turned a nice profit and left the door open for numerous sequels of which I've only seen part 2. It wasn't too bad, either. What a perfect film to watch so close to St. Patrick's Day!! 6 of 10 stars.Oh, sorry Jen! I forgot about The Good Girl. That was a pretty decent film, too. Maybe a cut above this one.The Hound.",Leprechaun

50,carbuff,"Cheesy, campy, cult classic worth a single viewing",7,21 June 2021,"""Leprechaun"" is an old, cheesy, campy, horror/comedy that is worth watching once just so that it's in your cultural database.It's a seriously dumb movie barely made to old TV production standards. It would be painful to watch twice or if it were 15 minutes longer (as a matter of fact, a bit more editing would have improved it). It's difficult to write a long review for such a trivial movie, except that I'm embarrassed to admit that it actually struck a horror nerve with me due to the Leprechaun's utter total relentlessness. So I'm left in this ambivalent position of recommending that at least all horror fans should see this movie once, but it's actually pretty bad, however at the same time I wimped out at points and felt some solid chills.I can't imagine watching any sequels, because the plot was so trivial and uninspired. I kind of feel that I wasted my time watching this, while on the other hand, I'm still kind of glad I did, just so I could understand references to it and make them myself. Therefore, I think I just wrote the weirdest review I've ever written. You won't be missing anything if you don't watch ""Leprechaun"", but you might want to watch it anyhow. At least it's short. Also, I didn't realize how shockingly attractive Jennifer Aniston was when she was young, which made it worth watching all by itself (yeah, I'm a guy and never watched a single episode of ""Friends"" in my entire life).",Leprechaun

Actually, she kills it, and way worse than the Leprechaaun. Look at meee, I'm the Leprechaaaun! Lol! Jennifer Aniston is so incredibly hot in the beginning of this, I'm not even kidding, her dress she's wearing...I'M SO LUCKY to watch it now and I had no idea her legs were so hot. Jennifer's voice is so sweet too, and so cute and so beautiful, like life is. Leprechauns exist. And they are very deadly. Just like this movie. I love Jennifer Aniston. God, she is so super cute and mega hot in the beginning of Leprechaun, in her short blue dress with white polka dots and matching blue heels. Jenny 'sexy from the block' Aniston wears that dress so right. I love it. And I love her. Leprechaun is a Halloween classic and I was 8 years old when this first came out back in 1993 so that means I first seen this probly around 9 or 10 so that was certainly the first time I'd ever seen Jennifer 'So Gorgeous Face' Aniston on t.v. and I don't recall really much but I do know that Jenn knocked me dead with her sweet beauty and I obviously on the spot fell madly in love with her as her sweet spiritual essence was transferred into my soul on a level so deep. Watching this now, not having seen it in like 20 years, lol, I can honestly tell you that Jennifer 'Hot Butt' Aniston is so much more beautiful than I ever even realized. She's my favorite woman in Hollywood, it's funny 'cuz it's true. Wahahaha!! I'm a Leprechaaauun!! You better ruuun. I'm gonna kill youu!!

This movie's real fun to watch and pretty funny but not real scary and if you're wondering, Leprechaun was really popular at the time that it came out. It's kind of lost as a cult classic now. Warwick Davis is the BEST little wee person actor ever. It's hard to tell in this, but just watch Willow, or anything else he's in. Davis is brilliant and I do find him to be the only little person actor in Hollywood with enough imagination and skills to portray a Leprechaaaun! That's me goold. Don't steal it. Just kidding. Davis acts with the best of 'em. I love Warwick Davis, BUT Jennifer '2 Die 4' Aniston has such hot legs in this movie! Leprechaun's really campy and totally delightful and magically delicious! Pure gold. I'm really lucky to be able to see Jennifer and be with her now. Jennifer is wearing some super awesome outfits in Leprechaun. I feel like Aniston hasn't fulfilled her destiny, in life. Leprechaun's not the scariest haunted flick, and it's not the most brilliant screen writing either, and it's pacing and what not aren't the best, BUT Jennifer Aniston is. And so's the concept of the villain, you know, the Leprechaun. I love this movie! In 100 years, people will love this even more than they do now, because of Jennifer 'You Take My Breath Away' Aniston. I love you Jennifer Aniston. So much. The only scene I remember from this as a young lass when I watched it is when the nice little harmless leprechaun is chasing Jennifer through the field at the end. I can see why. Jennifer's so athletic! She has such strong legs. I had no idea. Aniston's the real rare 4-leaf clover, in life.

The creature kills the man's wife and is hurt by the old man who puts him in a crate and seals it with a four-leaf clover on top. Just before the old man decides to light him on fire, he has a heart attack under the spell of the Leprechaun. The creature is locked in the crate with the leaf on top and can't get out unless someone gets the leaf off.Years later, a divorce father (John Sanderford of 'Saved by the bell' fame) and his daughter Tory (Jennifer Aniston, in her feature film debut) inherit the house where the old man and his wife were attacked. They meet three young men working at the house (Tory falls for the oldest of the group), who happen to know the O'Grady's. Soon after knowing the characters, the suspense starts to begin as one of the boys hears a voice and heads down to the basement where the Leprechaun is hiding in its crate. He moves the clover aside letting loose on the Leprechaun in which he will cut his ear to make a boot; Tory gets her leg scratch and her father gets his hand bitten by the creature.They all take Tory's father to the hospital where his character doesn't make an appearance after that.The little creature is on the rampage stalking those who talk to Tory or the boys and whoever's bothering him.The film is yet scary, but fun.

It's got cheesy special effects, dialogue that is painfully dated, and a plotline as absurd as it is comedic. The wise-talking leprechaun, while never once appearing as frightening or ever truly menacing, is more of a vehicle for comedic relief, which is pulled off surprisingly well.

Its about a 3 ft tall guy, who FAILS as a horror movie villain, and his victims are all outmatched. That is because, his first victims are an old couple. He kills an old lady...wow...hes real tough. Then her husband beats him up. I would have just stepped on the moron. Now, I like horror movies, especially 80s and 90s horror movies that are usually not rated all that great, but I should have listened when they said this one was a stinker. Don't waste your time on this one. If you want a good horror movie with good villains, go see Se7en or Silence of the Lambs, not pieces of crap like this",Leprechaun

""Leprechaun"" dances on the screen, a courageously terrible little horror jig that could have only come out in 1993, when movies this bad actually got halfway decent actors.The movie starts out with some promise as an elderly couple is tortured by a fiesty lil leprechaun who has been robbed of his pot of gold. We are treated to an old lady falling down some stairs and an angry husband who proceeds to lock the lil fella inside of a crate in his basement. Fast forward ten years and a young Jennifer Aniston and her father happen to move into the house. A half-wit accidentally releases the leprechaun from the crate and all hell breaks loose. By all hell breaking loose, I mean not much really breaks loose at all.The highlight of this film for me was seeing the leprechaun rip a dude's face to shreds and snap a guy's neck then ride a go-cart.Watch for the 'retarded' guy who played Francis in ""Pee Wee's Big Adeventure.""

The plot just seemed week and too easy, probably because its a comedy horror but still. It wasn't that intriguing and the acting didn't help as it wasn't convincing but I felt Jennifer Aniston did ok. For a comedy horror movie, there wasn't much funny and scary moments in it which is why the movie has received so much negativity. Seems like this movie didn't help Jennifer Aniston's career at all and thank goodness she found Friends or else she might have been an failed actor like the rest of the cast of this movie.",Leprechaun

65,Toronto85,Leprechaun,8,19 January 2013,"A leprechaun is after his pot of gold, and will kill anyone that gets in his way in ""Leprechaun"". It begins with a man trapping the leprechaun in a crate in his basement by sealing it up and putting a single four leaf clover on top of it. Ten years later, JD Reding and his daughter Tori (Jennifer Aniston) are moving into that same house with the leprechaun still trapped in the basement. We are then quickly introduced to Nathan, Alex and Ozzie who are helping to fix up the house. Eventually Ozzie accidentally lets the monster escape the crate, but no one will believe him when he cries claims of a leprechaun on the loose. Ozzie and soon come across the Leprechaun's gold, and that's when the chase is on. Most of the film is spent around the Leprechaun chasing the character's looking for his gold pieces back. It all leads up to a satisfying conclusion in which the character's must find a four leaf clover to put a stop to the terror.I really liked this movie when I first saw it as a kid, and I still do to this day. I would always rent this when I was a kid, it had a good mix of scares and light hearted moments which I enjoyed. Main characters Tori and Nathan have chemistry, and Ozzie and Alex have a fun friendship which works well. 'Leprechaun'is basically about the Lep chasing our cast around for his gold coins. It really picks up when he traps them all in the house and when Tori goes into town to learn more about the creature. Acting is great from everyone involved, especially Jennifer Aniston and Warwick Davis. There is a fair bit of blood, one scene in which the leprechaun stalks and kills a cop in the woods sticks out in particular.Overall, 'Leprechaun' is a fun horror film that I highly recommend. The series spawned many sequels, none as good as this first one (although part 3 in Vegas was pretty close). After the third one, the Lep goes in space and then into the ""hood""... it gets pretty silly.8/10",Leprechaun
66,Chaves7777,He wants his gold!,10,10 June 2007,"""Leprechaun"" is a movie that has obtained, to me, fame of ridiculous, and i thought that it was because i see few parts but i don't remember much, and the sequels - well, although i have just seen the part 4, i think- are awful!. But, the original ""Leprechaun"" is not so bad as much say, actually, i think that it fulfills their made. Is wonderful, funny and sometimes scare... but more funny than anything.This is another strange movie that we cant qualify in just one genre. There is another movie with this kind of characteristic, as ""Critters"" (Which, in spite of be wonderful and funny too, i think that don't have the same quality than ""Leprechaun""). ""Leprechaun"" definitively has the intention of be a horror movie, but certainly, has too light funny touches, which we see in: Firs of all, the villain, the leprechaun. Second, the kind, not of irony but yes of silliness, that the movie treats. Of course is not a really serious movie, is just a PERFECT MIDNIGHT MOVIE, but, although that the movie makes us laugh, makes us pass a good time too. The story is about a leprechaun who loves gold, but its beloved treasure is steal for an old man. But the evil -lover of shoes- character going to find his gold, in anyway. But, the old man locked him in a box. 10 years before, in spite of an unoccupied house, the box is still there. A visitors come for the new house. Then appears a rainbow... but this time, the gold can be they curse. The cast is good, we can see to Warwick Davis (As the evil Leprechaun), Jennifer Aniston (In her first role! And, damn! No matter what other says, she is fantastic here), Ken Olandt, Mark Holton, Robert Hy Gorman, Shay Duffin and John Sanderford. Mark Jones write and direct this rare horror funny fantasy, that have certain touch, certain -green- glitter that saves it. Of course that have ""big"" flaws, but i could not resist to give it a 10. Have rare scenes twist, certain illogical things, that makes me shave! Besides, when i found that Jennifer Aniston was here, i was more excited. The results were satisfactory, really satisfactory. Besides, Jennifer Aniston is amazing here, no matter what other says. Then, she ends her fight with the evil Leprechaun and go with her ""Friends"".** I think that people can give a chance to ""Leprechaun"", of course is not a GREAT and MONUMENTAL picture, but is still funny, clever and great! A really recommended for anyone who wants fun, laughs, low funny scares and just a good movie.**Actually, a lot of stars begin - and don't bad in it - in B movies: George Clooney in ""Return to Horror High or its Spanish title ""La Escuela del Terror"" and ""Return of the Killer Tomatoes"". To Tom Hanks in ""He Knows you're Alone"" and even Fergie and Paul Walker in ""The Monster in the closet"" ... so, its not a bad thing.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",Leprechaun

Eventually, the movie was so dump. I have to admit that Jennifer's first movie wasn't a nice one. Anyway, the kills were stupid, but so funny. The characters were ok. In my opinion, it's not a horror movie at all, it's more of a black comedy. Also, I can't imagine, why so many sequels of that movie happened, I mean the movie doesn't even had potential. I'm not gonna talk about the effects at all, because it was a low budget movie and it was expected that they were gonna be awful.

69,tequila101,"Hey tubby, you got a light for an old Leprechaun's pipe?",8,4 July 2012,"I love the first Leprechaun which came out and was directed by Mark Jones. I think it is the best in the series and along with the first two that came after it, all three of them deserve praise. Especially this one however as it doesn't try to be a good film. Its wacky, mildly cartoonish in violence, funny death scenes and an excellent music score. All of these things with weird plot holes is what makes Leprechaun so great.Getting off topic for a moment, I was mentioning how these elements worked to make the film work right? Well by Leprechaun 4 in Space, and then the two films where he goes to the hood don't work. Of course like the first one they're silly, but they never knew their limits and they failed to really provide comedy or horror. They just never worked. On another note, the 2nd and 3rd Leps in the series were able to work perfectly.Anyway back onto Leprechaun 1, it is a classy, cheesy popcorn horror film which will fill you heart with laughter. It knows it's limits and Warwick Davis as the Leprechaun is a joy to watch in action. It also marks some of the best quotes from the Leprechaun. The music score is also the best here as it combines and contrasts absurdness and creepiness together.Anyway, like many of Slasher Horror franchises like ""Halloween"", ""Child's Play"", ""TCM"" and ""SCREAM"", the first is always best to stick wit.It deserves 8 four-leaf clovers out of 10.",Leprechaun

73,Punk19,He doesn't go by the rules,10,9 June 2005,"When I first watched this film it freaked me out but now it doesn't. The film starts out like this.This looser named Daniel O'Grady catches a Leprechaun; we don't see him do it, and thus gets 3 wishes. He is now rich and comes home to his wife beaten down drunk. He not only brings the bag; don't be swayed when they say Pot 'O' Gold, of gold coins but a suit case. And what does that fat freak have in that suit case?! Why it be that Leprechaun that we love so much.Mrs.O'Grady opens the case and out comes that Leprechaun looking for his gold. He freaks out that woman so much that she falls down a stairway. The husband comes back as drunk as ever. He finds the Leprechaun in his house with tea. Well lets say that looser gets a four leaf clover and a gun. He shoots the Leprechaun and puts him in a crate. He doesn't get the chance to finish the job though.After this little crate incident we flash forward to 10 years. A family moves into that same house and are faced with the same problemic nightmare as the looser fat O'Grady. They fight off the Leprechaun with shoes, four leaf clovers, and skills only thought to be childish. Even my father was astonished when he first watched this.So there's my review. I only have a few minor words left........Remember to have your popcorn and some old shoes that need to be polished and a four leaf clover when you watch this.

This movie absolutely wrecked my childhood. No scary movie has had more of an influence on me than this movie right here. To this day, I still have nightmare's about Warwick Davis and his little green hat, but that fear from childhood slowly transformed into a deep-seated passion for this film.I know, I know, it's a terrible movie, that is without a doubt the truth, but because it had such a profound effect on me as a kid I found myself watching it over and over. Mainly so I could get over the fact that it was so traumatizing. In watching it so many times I fell in love, now it's, one of, if not my absolute favorite horror movie ever.Warwick Davis was honestly born to play this role, you can tell he just has so much fun terrorizing Rachel Green. Speaking of Jennifer Aniston, this being her breakout role it's safe to say that it's not her best representation of who she is as an actress, but she does a decent job of being terrified of a two and a half foot tall leprechaun.I think this movie is just the right amount of absurd and scary to justify it being a cult horror film and I look forward to the many repeated viewing I will have.

This is just your typical horror movie with a leprechaun doing the killing.

78,The_Celluloid_Sage,Absolute classic but very dated now,5,6 April 2020,"As we have already reviewed Rumpelstiltskin, we couldn't possibly leave out Mark Jones' first feature. If ever there was a film that deserved the cult film tag, it would be this one. That's not to say this is a great film because it really isn't, but it does have its place amongst the 'so bad it's good' films that have come out over the years.We start off with the wonderful Warwick Davis as the titular Leprechaun counting his gold muttering poetry about people trying to steal said gold. We quickly move on to Dan O'Grady coming home to his wife proclaiming riches and her thinking him barmy. Now despite apparently winning the gold fair and square like, lil ole Leprechaun is not impressed and makes immediate efforts to reclaim his precious gold. Before suffering a heart attack, good old Dan manages to trap the evil little menace into a crate and imprisons him by placing a four leafed clover atop it.Years later, Tory (a surprisingly good Anniston) and her dad arrive at the house. Dad has just bought the place and intends doing it up. Tory being a typical teenage city girl is far from impressed and wants as far away from hick town as possible until meeting the rugged painter and decorator Nathan (Olandt, who later went on to co-found the United Film Organisation). Smitten she decides to hang around and help dad out. Naturally, the crate with the evil imp inside it is found and well you can probably guess the rest. The Leprechaun escapes and is still hell-bent on finding his stolen gold.Crazy madness and deaths ensue as Tory and the rest try to survive while trying to figure out what the Leprechaun wants and where it is. Now I'll state it again, this is not a good film. The acting is above average and Warwick is brilliant as the Leprechaun. It also has a fairly reasonable score. One-liners, silly deaths and pure daftness (along with the obligatory dumbness) are the order of the day here and if that's your thing then the film will not disappoint, but Rumpelstiltskin is superior in every way, especially in the comedy stakes. As much as this is a classic, I still have no idea how it managed to spawn so many terrible sequels. One to watch when you want a laugh with some friends.

Surprisingly the best, or at least most memorable actor, is Warick Davis, (a.k.a. THE LEPRECHAUN himself). The Leprechaun is easily the goofiest slasher villain of all time. In the end how could a killer Leprechaun be taken, or even be, serious. The guy almost seems like a villain to a comedy rather than a horror movie. Actually this movie is so silly, that it is kinda more like a comedy movie. The rest of the actors are bad except for Jennifer Aniston, but even she isn't to good. The story line is as expected, pretty silly. Aniston and some other people whose names I don't remember move to an old abandon house in South Dakoda. They discover that the previous owners had a Leprechan locked in a wooden box. And the only thing keeping him from getting out is a four leaf clover on top of the box. Yeah thats right the Leprechaun's only weakness is a four leaf clover. That would be like if a werewolves weakness was the Full moon. So they take the four leaf clover off of the box which allows the Leprechaun to break free. The Leprechan claims that all he wants is his gold, and is willing to KILL FOR IT! The make up for the Leprechaun is kinda cool. As are a few of the effects. This is a terrible movie, and so are the sequels, so I don't recommend this franchise.

And soon the leprechaun starts killing off\or terrorizes anyone who comes on his path, the thing i personally really like about this movie and it's sequel is the acting of Warwick Davis because he really let's him self go as a psychotic little creep who just wants his gold back. He did a great job on the on-liners and acting, i think most fans of the genre are known with the film. However i don't know about the most people who watch mainstream movies, it never really gets over the top bloody or violent. It's more of a game of hide and seek between the victims and the leprechaun, if you've never seen it just give it try. It's a well made horror comedy, however there's one aspect i can't stand which is that Jennifer Aniston acts like she's embarrassed when someone finds out she starred in this movie.

You'll be introduced to Jennifer Aniston's first movie role and what a role it was (even though she doesn't like to talk about it).This movie's storyline is silly (but remember that's what makes a great cult classic).

Then, when I saw here that it's a comedy, my rating went up significantly because: This movie is bad for a fantasy and absolutely worthless as a horror. But. The thing is just hilarious. Any remotely horroristic stuff is completely destroyed in, well, about 5 seconds after the opening theme, when we first set our eyes on the Leprechaun. Because he just looks funny. And then he does funny things. And says funny things. Like, absolutely, ridiculously, I-just-suffered-permanent-mental-damage kind of funny.

Because this movie deserves more than a 4.6 I think for that time it was a pretty good movie with an interesting plot. A leprechaun who wants his gold and mistreats a family. It is funny on it's own special way but of course has also some horror themes in it with some fantasy theme in it. I'd say the perfect combination.So I'd like to continue the review with talking about Warwick Davis. He was just outstanding in this film. Warwick Davis played the role on a very funny way which makes you laugh incredibly. But he also play's it on a scary way, but after all you feel sorry for him when he ""dies"". The rhymes, The obsession with gold he played everything so real. He really lived up to the character and it was like he just played himself because he really dived into the role. Warwick Davis is just what makes this film a must watch. If you want a laugh watch Leprechaun. Warwick is incredibly funny and proved with this film he's the funniest man on earth. Beside Warwick the acting was pretty under a good level.The storyline worked very good actually. The jokes and actions of the leprechaun was amazing, but combined with the cruel killings you had really a good combination off comedy and Horror, I think the storyline was very good, and underrated. The Dialoque's in the films were alright, not amazing but it was acceptable.Leprechaun get's a 7 out of 10 from me because it was just a really interesting and good plot. Warwick played a big part in this maybe high rating. But I thought it deserved to be good.",Leprechaun

A leprechaun, searching for his gold coins, when some teens find them, and the leprechaun needs all his coins, spoiler, when a big person swallowed it. I only have some minor problems with this film. ( some spoilers ahead) 1.Why would the writers make someone swallow a coin? That was the main problem with the movie. It just did not seem right. 2. The actor who played Alex. Ugh. I could not stand him! He just annoyed me so much. 3. Jennifer Aniston's acting. She seemed unprofessional at doing what she does for a living! Those are my only problems with the movie. (Spoiler alerts ahead) the scariest scene was in the jewelry store in the safe. So not expecting a leprechaun to be in there! I do not recommend this for 14 year olds or under.

96,NateF88,Great Horror classic creature flick,10,10 June 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I thought Leprechaun was a really good movie. Why did critics hate it so much? I mean this was a good film with really good creature, makeup and gore effects. Dan O' Gradey steals a pot of gold from a Leprechaun (who says that whoever steels his gold will die)in Ireland and then brings it back home with him to North Dakota where he thinks it will get him wealthy and him and his wife will be much happier than the way they normally are. His wife dosn't believe the Leprechaun part but somehow the Leprechaun followed Mr. O'Gradey back home in a package and gets into his house. *spoilers* . While Mrs. O'Gradey is brewing some tea, the leprechaun disguises his low, evil voice into a child's voice screaming to get out of a package. Mrs. O'Gradey opens the package and the Leprechaun hops out and scares her so much that she falls down the stairs, brakes her neck, and dies. Mr. O'Gradey is chased by the Leprechaun to get the gold but manages to nail him shut into a big box and secure a four leaf clover on top so the Leprechaun dosn't get out. RIght before he means to set it on fire, he has a stroke or something but dosn't die. A couple years later Tory Reding comes with her father J.D. to the O'Gradey home for the summer. Tory meats a man named Nathan who plans on painting the home again for renovation. They start to like each other alot. Ozzie (an adult), and Alex (a kid) are friends who also paint the house. Tory accidentally wakes the Leprechaun up and the Leprechaun sets out to find his missing gold, killing anyone that gets in his way. I loved Jennifer Aniston cuase she's one of my favorite people in the world, and I liked the Leprechaun too. Lots of good humor. My only problem is the body count. 4 people die in this flick. Only four. 2 are really bloody, and that's it. The others are either bloodless or offscreen. But really, it's still a gory flick, and it does satisfy gorehounds. If you like creature features or Jennifer Aniston, this is a must for you.",Leprechaun
97,arc_a2007,So bad it's kind of good,6,2 September 2008,"Leprechaun is one of those films that's so cheap, poorly written and cheesy that you can't help but enjoy it for that reason alone. It's a horror movie that tries its hardest to come across as scary, and falls flat on its face in the process. What the devil possessed me to see this film then? For some reason, back in the 90's it was a hot topic among my friends in middle school. I never got the opportunity to see it then, so when I saw the first four movies up on SciFi, I decided to go ahead and see them; maybe they'd bring a laugh or two. They did exactly that. Anyway...The plot of this film is the typical horror movie fare. You've got a handsome dude and a hot chick trying to survive against some horrible monster. Here, the handsome dude has two brothers, the younger one and the mentally challenged older one (I didn't even know that was the case until about a half hour into the film). As for the monster, you should know who that is by the title. Not surprisingly, he ends up being the highlight of the film. It's not very scary as a whole, unless you're under eight years old, but it's the Leprechaun's comedic one-liners, along with the almost satirical plot, that really carry the film. The bottom line is though, if you go into the film expecting to be scared or grossed out, you're going to be disappointed. But if you go into it expecting a cheesy and clichéd, but humorous twist on horror, you're sure to enjoy it.",Leprechaun

101,marcusman48,More blarney than banshees,5,11 September 2009,"Crafting a horror film involves a level of sophistication with which most critics seem unwilling to credit filmmakers. It's not just about stringing together a whole bunch of suspenseful sequences involving spooky shadows, mysterious locations, grotesque whatchamacallits and butcher-worthy victims. In order for a horror movie to truly resonate, it should be shot through with a rather perverse sensibility that, while stopping short of outright sadism, still betrays a noticeable degree of misanthropy. The best horror is like hard-core pornography in that it invites its viewers to feast on the bodies (and, sometimes, the minds and souls) of its human subjects as if they were so many Chicken McNuggets. And if the meal can be served up with a sprinkling of gleeful humor, so much the better! LEPRECHAUN is a simple yet potentially effective horror offering that ultimately falls short of its purpose because its attitude toward its ""good-guy"" characters is too idealistic, even innocent. We have a spoiled Southern California teen girl, Tory (Jennifer Aniston), visiting her father on a quaint North Dakota farm, where she encounters the eccentric yet lovable ""3 Guys Who Paint"" - a trio of house painters consisting of mismatched siblings Alex (Robert Gorman) and Ozzie (Mark Holton) and sensitive hunk Nathan (Ken Olandt). The four unlikely visitors all become friends, whereupon they find themselves jointly contending with a murderous old leprechaun (Warwick Davis) who's bitter about the inadvertent theft of his bag of gold coins by the dimwitted Ozzie.As far as the titular Irish fairy is concerned, you're not likely to be disappointed: he's a true monster whom any horror connoisseur can relish, with filthy sharp claws and a repulsive face as gnarled and reddish as mahogany wood. Davis also portrays him in much the way you would expect and demand a leprechaun to be played: sordidly comical, what with his Munchkin-like fashion sense and his constant giggling, leering, scampering about, and reciting singsongy whimsy in the manner of a psychopathic Victorian poet. Standing barely three feet tall, however, he's not exactly the most intimidating of foes. Yet even that is a minor liability to the movie's impact compared to woefully inappropriate tone that the filmmaker lends to the material.My real complaint with LEPRECHAUN lies with the characterizations of Tory, Alex, Ozzie, and Nathan. They are certainly not perfect, and even come off as risibly annoying on occasion. But the story appears to take a more-or-less sympathetic approach toward them, setting them up as cheerful and resourceful young folk - at times even quixotically chipper, like cutesy characters in a Disney animated film. This is a mistake precisely because good horror films should not feature sympathetic protagonists.The secret to enjoying horror, I believe, generally lies in identification with the monster and an edge of voyeuristic cruelty directed at his/her/its prey. If the potential victims are too thoroughly humanized, we tend to fear for them rather than laughing them off as suckers. In George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, for example, the camera's attitude remains clinical: the flesh-eating zombies are literally beyond identification, but the humans pitted against them are, in their way, no less freakish. A horror flick's damsels and dudes in distress should strike us as effete, petty, discombobulated, and above all ineffectual. They should seem already to be nonentities, just waiting for the killer to actualize their irrelevance in grossly physical terms. But Tory and her companions seem like the sort you might find comfortable bringing along on a family picnic.It's fun watching Davis's sinister sprite torture and mutilate the puny humans standing in the way of his pot o' gold, but that's only in the case of the nameless tertiary characters. The four young people who oppose him elicit our sympathy, and thus they almost shift our focus away from the charismatic title demon. It's almost as if the producers and director wanted to make a sassy family comedy in the style of HOME ALONE, only with a demented otherworldly being instead of two goofy burglars.",Leprechaun
102,accattone74,"A Mean, Green Mother from Inner Dublin",10,16 November 2010,"SEE THIS MOVIE!St. Patrick's Day... what movie should you watch to celebrate this all-important holiday. There are just so many to choose from: Michael Collins – no, too serious. The Wind That Shakes the Barley – nope, too good. My Left Foot – who wants to read subtitles? Rattle & Hum – I'd sooner shoot myself. What else but Leprechaun! Any movie in which a perpetually rhyming, 600-year old, malevolent green dwarf threatens to make a boot out of someone's ear unless he gets his gold back is, in my book anyway, destined for (bad)greatness.The year was 1993, and the big horror movie icons were still Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, and then-newcomer Chucky. The first three were really winding down in the originality department. I found myself renting the old Friday, Nightmare, and Halloween movies instead of going out to see the new ones. And I was never into Chucky honestly; I always found him rather predictable, almost boring – possession, homicidal maniac, but a doll big deal. Enter Leprechaun. I remember first hearing about it and thinking that mainstream cinema had reached an all-time-low indeed. But, of course, I went to go see it out of curiosity. Once Lep was let out of the box though, or crate if you will, and began his doggerel-rampage of death I knew I was in for something quite unique. I mean a friggin' Leprechaun! I never knew what he'd do next. What film template did I have to base my emotional reactions on? Here was a movie-monster with revenge on his mind like all the others, yes—but no one's really done anything to him. He just wants his money back. Being half-Irish myself, and a capitalist (however regretfully), I was left dumbstruck by the blatant racism of Leprechaun, in which the central character is Irish, mean, green, money- grubbing, seemingly drunk, violently-tempered, and always-rhyming; the movie actually equates wanting money with releasing great evil unto the world. But then I thought about it for a few minutes and eventually calmed down. I realized it was all actually true, and that I had witnessed an incredibly terrifying horror movie cum Irish neo-realist film that contained some of the most hysterically quotable dialogue I'd come across since Dream Warriors: ""This thing is a Leprechaun and we've GOTTA figure out how to stop it!""Mark Jones—the same man who also directed the first, and best, one in the Leprechaun series—has written all six films as well. (By the way, the immediate sequels are all right, but you haven't lived a proper I-love-bad-movies existence until you've seen Leprechaun 4: In Space, and Leprechaun in the Hood.) Mr. Jones first made a name for himself writing and story-editing many episodes of The A-Team, so you know the man has a talent, not just for genius dialogue, but also for keeping you and yours on the edge of your leather love-seat. He also wrote and directed the 1996 guffaw-your-ass-off-or-this-other-midget-monster- will-get-you classic Rumpelstiltskin.",Leprechaun

The whole movie: "" ME GOLD,ME GOLD, ME GOLD"" I know you gotta pay dues, but I know Jennifer Aniston doesn't remind anyone that she's in this movie. 1 key part that was funny is when she's in the elevator after being chased by the leprechaun through the nursing home,and the old man that the leprechaun killed gets thrown through the top of the elevator. Think his name was Mr.O'Grady. Even though the dude is near death he has the final dramatic final speech for Jenn. For some reason at this point he develops the leprechaun's accent. ""In order to kill em ya needs a 4 leaf clover, freshly plucked from the garden"", or something like that its so funny. Then close to the end the fat dude is like we can find the 4 leaf clover if you believe we can find it. And as soon as he says it they find 1.

111,jewbo23,Best of the series by far.,6,14 September 2005,"Now the Leprechaun films are never going to be held as classics of modern cinema. But as a fun little cheesy horror flick the first Leprechaun works quite well. Tory (played by Jennifer Aniston) and her father have, for some reason decided to spend the summer in a run down house in the middle of nowhere. Little do they know that ten years earlier some guy had trapped a Leprechaun in the basement after stealing his gold. Then we meet three guys that are here to paint the house (by the way I love their company name '3 guys that paint' classic). one of them, the stupid Ozzie, sets the Leprechaun free. Then Ozzie and his child friend Alex find the gold the Leprechaun is still looking for and they hide it dreaming of riches. Of course then all hell breaks loose. Now I found the film kind of enjoyable. The acting is pretty good on the main part. Jennifer Aniston may be embarrassed of this film now I'm sure, but she didn't seem as if she minded that much back then (probably just needed the money). All the characters are pretty likable. The stupid but funny Ozzie, The cool and smart little kid Alex and the hero Nathan. Of course Warwick Davis is superb as the Leprechaun even though he does have some really terrible bad lines. There isn't much in the way of gore. In fact the little guy doesn't really kill that many people at all. That's a bit of a downer. We do get to see the Leprechaun take a bit of a beating with a cut off hand and a stick in his eye but its not enough really. So on the whole and OK film that has its good point and its bad ones. For instance what's that scene all about where they throw shoes at him and he is running all over the place cleaning them? I get that he was a shoe maker but is he really all that bothered if they are a bit dirty? I liked the bit with our little friend on his tricycle and the Lucky Charms reference was kind of cool. The direction was OK a few nice use of angles but pretty basic on the whole.

I liked that the teen couple though flirted didn't have to have typical romantic ending which is so commonly boring. I liked that most of the cast were unknowns. At least at the time. The comedy is hilarious. I heard it wasn't supposed to be till Warrick suggested it. I don't think this movie would've been as fun without it. As many horror films, the good ones add a little bit of comedy. The length of the film was good. It wasn't too long nor too short. Just resaw it on bluray, nice quality. Worth it. The widescreen looks spectacular and the images look clear as daylight. Time to get to the awaited Jennifer Aniston Critique. When I first saw this movie she wasn't famous. I liked her in the movie and thought she did a great job. She didn't look spectacular or anything. Just like a normal girl. Just like many of the goosebumps episode just a normal cute girl. Then she started to make more movies and became famous for the stupid friends show. Now I didn't know her because of her other work. I knew her because of this and since this I recognized in her other movies. Some movies she did I liked like Picture Perfect. But She falls to the perfect Hollywood brainwashing. All she cared about was her stupid career. She never had kids, she got tons of surgery done, and did a bunch of sell out roles. She was never a good actress. Funnily bad mouthing this(leprechaun) when many of her roles and acting stink. Friends is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. With the ugliest people, terrible acting, and worst jokes. Obviously made for brain dead people. Was it worth selling your soul for a couple of millions? She could've easily been as she was in the beginning of her career. A cute girl done a few movies and gone on with her life. Instead shes just another dumb plastic bimbo. Now when I watch this I look away at the screen. She got so much stuff shes almost unrecognizable. She was just fine the way she was. She wasn't a 10 but she had nice legs, she was cute. The conceit got to her. Its not like her movies are that great that you can say ""well she had a great stellar career who could blame her?"". Of course now she bad mouths leprechaun. I read that she was an unknown when she got this role and the director fought for her to get her first role. What a great way to show gratitude. Its not like her role was that bad or that it demanded much. Too bad the fame and money got to her. SHe could've been such a good girl. Now I don't get why this film is so bashed. In many ways its a classic. The only leprechaun movie, which also has a bit of horror and humor. Now I read many critics bashing the hell out of this. Which I don't get. This movie is by far not terrible. But they make it seem like its they didn't put any effort in it. There's a reason why It barely had a 1 million budget but it made 8 million. Had plenty of rentals. Has been released on DVD, bluray( the entire series. Hard to believe), they give on syfy every year on St. Patricks day. It has been on some horror movie lists. Critics are so stupid. They bash classic movies like this and then praise all the garbage that's coming out. But if it was as bad as people say it wouldn't have sold. I barely know anyone who hasn't seen this movie or at the very least know the character. Thats coming along way. I remember as a kid it was funny and scary and all my friends loved it. I also like make up not the cgi crap nowadays. Makeup plays a major role in make belief. And the makeup looked really good. I read Warrick had to go through for 4 hours for it to be done and being still for most of that time. Without being able to warm up before the role. Another 40 mins to take it off. Thats some good dedication( for not a big salary). lol. Though many of the sequel were inferior and this is the unique original. Id give this the best leprechaun because of its originality and it being the creator of it all. Plus it stuck to the origin of it with its folklore while the others drifted off. Totally recommended and blasts to watch it. I'll always watch it on Leprechuans birthday.",Leprechaun
123,boldentommy,my eyes are bleeding,1,7 August 2012,"There are many questions that can be asked about a movie like this and here are some examples. First why did I rent this. Second why did I bother putting it into my DVD player. Third why didn't i just shut it off before the credits even started. So lets break it down first of all the high points Jennifer aniston is in this movie, and that does it for the high points. I can almost imagine the meeting they had for this movie. Big time movie clerk walks in alright guys we need a new horror movie icon what we got. Come on guys you got to have something ,you yeah you in the back what you got. OK boss its a leprechaun and he's mad because someone has stolen his gold. Sounds good here's 900,000 and get me a director. Yeah that seems right this movie is just tragic, and why do i say that? Because someone could have actually made a good film about an evil leprechaun and people would have watched it but instead we have this beating by way of film. OK he shines shoes and makes things in a garage and the only way you can beat him is with a four leaf clover. The best part was in the final scene when the kid screams F$%k your lucky charms and shoots the clover in his mouth.

127,LNAndersen,Entertaining Series,6,21 April 2021,"Leprechaun 1 is the most mainstream in a very quirky and funny series (I havn't seen the 6th installment).2 and 3 suffer from a lot of very one dimensional characters. The Leprechaun character though still gives them some charm. 2-4 have also a very strong b-film vibe. However 4 (In Space) I find hilarious and a lot more sophisticated than maybe first meets the eye.In 5 (In the Hood) we still find the same quirky humor as in the previous films but more effort seems to have been made into it. There's more good dialogue, more thought has been given into making the characters and it almost doesn't feel like a b-film. The best in the series in my opinion.Leprechaun: Origins is sort of ok but it totally lacks the unique charm of the previous installments.

129,Century_hades,Avoid this film!,1,2 November 2013,"I just finished watching this train wreck movie. Thank god it was on netflix.I've seen this movie floating around video rental stores for years, and years. I've always just looked at the cover, and thought the whole idea sucked.I saw it pop up on netflix, and decided to watch it. Mainly because Jennifer Aniston is in this film, and I use to watch Friends back in the 90's.15 minutes in I wanted to shut it off, but though sheer will power I made it though the movie.The story is so badly written, and it's never clear why people do anything. Tori (played by Jennifer Aniston) and her Dad are ether moving, or just spending the summer in this totally run down hole of a house in the middle of now where. It is never made quite clear.They show up, and are only there for a few minutes when three morons are painting the exterior of there crap house. We are left having to assume the dad hired them to paint his house.The painting crew consists of the ""hero"" of the story who has a bad mullet, and fails of every level to be cool. There is some fat brainless fool, and a young kid.And...Oh hell I can't go on with this review. I'm just torturing myself for no reason at all.There is only one good thing about this film, Jennifer Aniston looks good. There is nothing else about it. How these movies are even made to begin with is beyond me.",Leprechaun

Seeing that little leprechaun in his stereotypical uniform and Mother Hubbard boots leaping around the screen killing his victims has to be one of the funniest moments in horror/comedy. The acting is also above average and Jennifer Anniston is quite good as the Clueless California babe lost in hicksville!! Great sleep-over movie and an overall uplifting, well made little horror gem!",Leprechaun
131,generouspalmstroke,Jennifer Aniston's catalyst into stardom...,1,2 March 2010,"Call me foolish for expecting an even half-quality film which centers around a demonic leprechaun killing for his gold, but this film was so awful it didn't even supply laughs. How this has a cult following -- or ANY following, for that matter -- is beyond me. How this utter trash spawned five sequels is even crazier. There's no way this brought in enough dough to supply the writer and the director for the sixth installment: ""Leprechaun - Back 2 Tha Hood"". The title enough is a red flag.Speaking of the writer, this has to have been written by a seven-year old. It's probably some of the most tiring writing I've ever heard in a movie of ANY genre. Dora the Explorer has better dialogue. Hell, silent movies from the 1920's have better dialogue. How someone would sign for this movie is unbelievable. The chavs in my English class could form better sentences.All four of the main characters are terrible, terrible actors--although it's Aniston at her finest. The worst is undisputablely Ken Olandt as the clichéd macho, wise-cracking hero. Robert Hy Gorman's role was very infuriating. I'm not sure if the director wanted him to be so obnoxious viewers wanted nothing more than to punch him repeatedly, but if that was his goal it's probably the only successful thing throughout the movie he accomplishes.Something I can always count on when watching these older slasher (I guess that's what you would call this???) flicks are the awesome kills. They're always great. They usually make me chuckle at how ridiculous they are. Killing someone by jumping on them with a pogo stick was the only enjoyable kill of the movie. Come to think of it, I think this only had three kills in total. Even the body-count is miserable. Not even any of the four main characters died. That was basically what kept me watching--the prospect of one of them getting sliced 'n' diced.Basically every aspect of this film is a failure. How they could make a movie about a murderous leprechaun any worse than it sounds is astonishing. My brother even fell asleep while watching this. And it was eight in the evening.I'm probably coming off as up-tight, but I'm really not. I know this movie wasn't supposed to be taken seriously--how could it be if the people making it weren't even taking it seriously?--but I can enjoy the campy, cheesiness of Friday the 13th. Hell, I love those movies! But this... this is just pitiful. Let me say that I know now why I managed to snag the first three in the series for a measly $12. Needless to say I think part II and III of this series may remain unwatched for a long, long time to come.The oodles of negative things aside, ""Leprechaun"" did have one saving grace: Jennifer Aniston's legs.",Leprechaun
132,musukogoji,Too many people hate this movie for such a stupid reason.,10,2 September 2016,"A strangely common misconception with people is that this movie was supposed to be scary. Seriously? You actually think that a movie about a killer leprechaun was meant to scare you. Unfortunately, that is what so many people think. Those people apparently have never heard the term ""horror comedy"" or ""cult classic"". So, here's some full closure. No, this movie isn't meant to scare you. It's meant to amuse you. And it fulfills it's purpose beautifully.So, the story begins with a man returning to America from Ireland, where he tells his wife that he stole a pot of gold from a leprechaun. She, of course, doesn't believe him. However, moments later, the Leprechaun, played by Warwick Davis, shows up at the home and tries to steal his gold back. But the man outwits him and traps him in a crate.10 years later, a woman, played by Jennifer Aniston, and her father move into the same house, now abandoned, and hire ""3 Guys That Paint"" to work on it. But when one of the painters accidentally sets the Leprechaun free, all hell breaks loose. The Leprechaun's motivation is plain and simple: he wants his gold, and he'll kill anyone to get to it. The reason so many people love this movie is because the characters take their situation so seriously even though their dealing with something as silly as a killer leprechaun. It's the perfect recipe for a funny, gory, and one hell of a good time.Leprechaun was followed by several sequels. By the third one, he was in Las Vegas, then in space, in the hood, back to the hood, and by 2014, WWE studios had removed Warwick Davis, along with all the wit and charm he had with him in the butchered reboot, Leprechaun: Origins.So, in short, (no pun intended) this movie is as charming as they come and I would recommend it to any fan of horror.",Leprechaun

134,crawlfan-1,"""Now THAT was fun!""",6,23 September 2007,"Every horror movie nowadays is plain, unoriginal, and boring. Horror movie producers keeping feeding the public vampires, serial killers, zombies, etc. Nothing new and exciting, until now. In Leprechaun, Mark Jones introduced the most creative and fun horror film of the early 90s. Whereas this movie doesn't have the power to make you shriek in terror, it has more than enough to make up for that. For example, it was interesting to see Jenifer Aniston before she could act. As a matter of fact, all of the acting in this movie is pretty stale, with the large exception of Warwick Davis as the homicidal Leprechaun. This movie is extremely atmospheric and unforgettable. Several sequels (five, as a matter of fact) followed this film, and every one of them are so tremendously different from the first one that you question if it's the same homicidal Leprechaun in each movie.Regardless, this one is well worth your time.",Leprechaun
135,canucks_88,The Beginning Of A Cult Phenomenon,5,29 March 2007,"Alright ""phenomenon"" may be a stretch, but ""cult"" definitely describes the Leprechaun film franchise. Writer/Director Mark Jones really took some chances with this movie in the early 90's, a time when the Horror genre appeared to be washed up. The end result was a moderately successful B movie that developed a small, but enthusiastic fan base. The idea of a leprechaun in a slasher flick may seem like a ridiculous concept at first. Let's face it, in most folk tales leprechauns are portrayed as adorable little Irish elves; not as hideous, conniving, murderous creatures. Mark Jones could have tried to make this a dark film, and if he had done that it likely would have failed miserably. By throwing some humour into the mix, the concept of the film begins to make sense and the movie becomes rather enjoyable to watch. Leprechaun was well-cast. Jennifer Aniston got her first big break, and she did a tremendous job. Watching her for the first time, it was obvious that she was going to move on to bigger and better things. Warwick Davis is another talented actor and was the perfect choice to play the Leprechaun. This franchise would likely have never become so popular if it weren't for him. The rest of the cast is made up mostly of character actors such as Ken Olandt, Mark Holton, and Robert Gorman. While their performances aren't Oscar worthy, they all do their part to keep the film moving along smoothly. The story is nothing too complex. It is what one would expect for a horror film with a Leprechaun. A Leprechaun has his pot of gold stolen and will stop at nothing to retrieve it and murder anyone who gets in his way. The only way he can be stopped is by using a four-leaf clover. The effects were decent for a low budget movie. The Leprechaun's make-up was very well done. It really enhanced the idea that this is supposed to be an evil Leprechaun. Overall if you are expecting to get a good scare from this movie, you will be disappointed. However, if you are simply looking for a simple, enjoyable movie with some light humour and a decent amount of gore, then this would definitely be worthwhile.",Leprechaun
136,DarkSchumyFan,Absolute Horror Classic,10,16 July 2003,"I try not to rate movies at IMDb based on entertainment value but on how good of a film they are, and Leprechaun is an absolutely horrendous film. Dismal supporting cast, not even remotely scary, claustrophobic setting(though some would argue that's not a bad thing).
In Lerechaun's case however I have to make an exception.  This is one of the most entertaining movies you will ever watch.  In this first installment of the series most of it is unintentional but you'll laugh regardless.  There are so many classic moments in this film you can't count.  Particularly when the Leprechaun first gets on the roller skates and can't skate worth a dime and crashes, but then gets up and skates off as if he has been skating for twenty years.  Or when he rolls a pick-up truck using a go-cart and pitchfork, the hilarity never stops.10 of 10 A+",Leprechaun

I love B-movies, campy horror and classic monster movies, and boy did this movie not disappoint. The plot was goofy and fun, the acting was bad enough to not be anywhere close Oscar worthy, but also good enough to have a bit of fun with and enjoy. I have seen bad B-movies that are practically some film students final project from some middle of nowhere college, and in comparison this was Oscar worthy. There was a clear and fun plot, the characters had an interesting and dumb dynamic, there were classic bad horror movie tropes and overall it was enjoyable entertainment. It was no way some super in depth drama, but I equate it to a summer blockbuster without as big of a budget. Something you can turn your brain off and not have to think too hard about while just enjoying the entertainment. Supposedly though, Jennifer Aniston doesn't like that this film is in her career/film history, and I wish that she did as it is an incredibly fun film and a great start to a franchise that has become a huge ""cult classic"".",Leprechaun

He would talk to them, and not taunt them about how they'll die, he'll just, talk. Also, unlike other bad horror films, we see people being plucked out of the movie one by one. In Leprechaun, hardly anybody dies at all. Which was very different. At least it had some heart. Heheh... Also, I had a lot of enjoyment from the leprechauns weakness...dirty shoes.

He chews for a moment, then spits it out. It was funny! I mean this is the film debut of Jennifer Aniston, and she is just terrific as a a stuck up city girl, who is spoilt by her father. I found it very entertaining to watch the man child interact with the smart mouth kid. And it has a creative kill! The Leprechaun bounces up and down and this shop keepers chest with a pogo stick!

153,turtlebleach,My biggest guilty pleasure,6,20 November 2012,Wow just wow. This is the Most entertaining bad movie I have ever seen. I mean wow. I don't know what to think about this movie. It is in some cases horrible. But in some cases it is a pretty good slasher movie. The Leprechaun Looks good but he doesn't look scary. The characters are pretty bland but the kid is BAD A$$. His line at the end of the is AWESOME but I will not say it here but I will tell you it is COSMIC. The leprechauns krypton is four leaf clovers. Really I mean really I s^&t you not. That is like if Lon Chaney was afraid of clowns. The movie is Terrible in parts but it is also good in parts. But it is all around entertaining and fun even if it is not good. The ending makes no sense though. God bye and god speed,Leprechaun
154,skrubpwner,Little Green B*stard,10,18 March 2021,This movie scared the hell out of me. Is this based on a true story? Ive heard rumors that Ireland has real leprechauns. God bless their souls if that is true. Do i need to grow clovers in my yard to protect myself from these little creatures? Happy Saint Pattys day everyone!,Leprechaun
155,dronrules,what a find,5,4 March 2006,"After seeing clips of all the films in this series on a recent episode of a new film review show i decided to check out good old IMDb to find out more. I remembered the first film to the extent of knowing i had seen it before. The thing that had attracted me to them is Jen Aniston as i am a big fan of her work in Friends. When reading the review's posted in this section i realised what to expect, and not to take the film to serious. So after getting paid i headed of to my local store to purchase the original. When i could not find it i asked f they had it in stock and they said they would have to order it in. But then as if by fate i found it at the very back of the store in a section of cheap random dads. However my luck soon doubled when i saw they had the firs three titles. Well seeing the opportunity i purchased the first two. Getting home i settled down for the movie which i found to be very enjoyable.All though it definitely has it's many weak points. You just cant help but go along with the entertaining if simple story line. The Leprechaunn scenes are all highly amusing albeit to varying levels.I noticed in the reviews that a lot of you thought the rhyming was a good thing. With this i whole heartedly agree but in some scenes it just did not boad well. There were some ill timed jokes and poor acting but nothing intolerable. The plus side was when the jokes were a success as they proved highly amusing. The gore and murder scenes where very well done on a cheap budget and obviously flawed film making. Jen Aniston is the best of the main cast even rivalling that Cheery Little Irish devil in some of the scary scenes. Ah that brings me to my next point.This is not a horror film but more of a black comedy in my opinion as there is more sick humour than anything else. Eg bouncing pogo stick in and out of a mans chest. The murders are all done in bad taste but thats one of the major appealing factors.The main ways this film fails is the same as of the genre flops/cult films like A crack in the floor. Panting a country house bright red and blue i ask you! Also some of the scares scenes are predictable. The story line is very weak in places and the acting poor with two obvious exceptions.",Leprechaun
156,shawncrutchfield,Timeless Classic in my Book,5,14 January 2019,This has an instresting take on leprachauns as a whole.He has his quirks being a shoeshiner he compulsivly shines shoes the whole movie. The way they represented his magical powers was great to. Not the scarriest movie on the block but managed to hold my intrest based on pure curiosity of the chacacter they developed and i think thats what movies are all about.,Leprechaun
157,Mr.Zebra,"Ugh! If you rent this clunker, your luck just ran out.",1,7 July 1999,"This movie was stunningly poor.  Stunningly poor.  I am at a loss to explain how anyone could justify one sequel, much less three.  Hell, I can't figure out how the damned movie even managed to get distributed in the first place (despite the Jennifer Aniston factor, which is really no factor...her feeble powers are completely overwhelmed by this amateurish nightmare of a film). The story is dull, the dialogue is flat, and the decrepit little villain is evil in the most unimaginative, unmagical ways.  It's hard to believe anyone could write such a boring, labored script.  If you're looking for a pot o' gold at your local Blockbuster, don't bother searching for it in a plastic case marked ""Leprechaun.""  All you'll find there is a tepid cauldron of algae-coated swamp water.",Leprechaun
158,sportsfan,Where's me gold coin?,10,1 January 2000,"This movie is cool! I've never laughed so hard in my life.There are some great lines in the movie, but the best was ""Where's me gold coin?""I can't wait for the next Leprechaun movie to be released later in 2000.Ireland for ever!",Leprechaun

160,nowimnothing13,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,4 January 2002,"When i rented this movie, I thought I was in for a classic and memorable horror experience.  I mean, everybody's heard of this movie, right, so it would have to be sort of good. WRONG!  This movie was so bad it wasn't even laughably bad.  When it was supposed to be scary, it wasn't.  When it was supposed to be funny, it wasn't.  The whole movie is pretty much just a site gag (""Ha Ha!  Look at the midget run!"") with some sort of poor excuse for a plot.  Oompa Loopas are funnier and scarier.  Also, it has one of those feel good endings that really makes me hate 90s horror.  This movie failed miserably.",Leprechaun
161,YellowJacketYJ,Not as bad as some make it out to be,5,4 April 2008,"I used to call Leprechaun a guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, I didn't mention it to many people, for the fear of being pointed and laughed at, while I hear people yelling ""He's the guy that liked Leprechaun!"" So, I kept it a secret. Until now! Why now, you ask (I don't care if you didn't ask, I'm going to tell you anyway)? Simply put, you can all still ridicule me, but I won't be able to hear you laugh or see you pointing at me.Despite the fact I declare Leprechaun a guilty pleasure, the more I watch it, the more I hate it. Yes, I still find redeemable qualities (though, nowadays, that's becoming quite a task). But, the smell of crap is starting to fill the room anytime I put Leprechaun on.First and foremost, the main cast (excluding Warwick Davis as the Leprechaun) is idiotic and annoying. How am I supposed to care for these people when they're in danger, when all I keep thinking about is ""I hope that house collapses on all of them""? The answer: I can't! That's where the problem lies (cheats and steals?). Without a likable round-up of people, then the story itself falls flat on its face.The main cast itself is bad, but nobody, and I mean nobody, was more annoying than Robert Gorman, who played the young kid Alex. Talk about your annoying kid actors. For the love of God, couldn't somebody have smacked the kid and threw him into the well that was in the backyard? I've seen some annoying child actors in my day (surprisingly, not including Dickie Roberts. Mainly for the fact that a grown man as a child actor is kind of creepy. I'm talking about you Christopher Knight). I would rather walk onto burning hot magma while having fat little trolls stab me with pitchforks, with House of the Dead (the crappy Uwe Boll movie, not the fun video game) playing simultaneously.Overall, Leprechaun is like having a fun night out on the time. At first, you're living it up with your buddies, laughing your asses off, and shining people's shoes (this is what happens when you party with Warwick Davis). Then, a bunch of morons join in the fray, ruining your night. Then, you pass out in the bathroom and wake up the next morning with a horrible hangover that makes George W. Bush's presidential run seem tolerable compared to the immense pain your in. Basically, this was just my way of saying that Leprechaun has its moments, but has many flaws that smacks it in the face with a bullwhip.",Leprechaun
162,RadioactiveGhost,"Not amazing, but remains a classic",6,7 November 2009,"The first film of the franchise, ""Leprechaun"" was released on January 1st, 1993. The storyline is a little silly, and visual effects aren't very good, but the acting is, for the most part, quite engaging. I will admit it wasn't perfect and could use some work, but it wasn't all that terrible, either. Warwick Davis (the Leprechaun) does a fantastic job of holding your attention; without him, the movie wouldn't have been the same at all.This is my second-favourite film of the ""Leprechaun"" series. The plot is incredibly easy to follow--a homicidal leprechaun wants his gold back and will kill anyone who gets in his way. That simple. Though the Leprechaun is without a doubt the most entertaining character featured in the flick, Jennifer's Aniston's character, Tory Reding, has her moments, such as when she finally stops whining and starts toughening up, along with Alex Murphy, played by Robert Gorman, and his witty remarks throughout, not to mention being the one to defeat the Leprechaun at the end.But I will be very honest: this is not a very frightening film. For those who are expecting some serious scares, this is not for you. The violence can be graphic, but those scenes are brief.Overall, I enjoyed it. The only ""Leprechaun"" film better than this is the third one.MY RATING: 6.4/10",Leprechaun
163,ayshuleoayesha,Best ever,9,21 August 2019,"This was the best movie compared to all the parts made..
The characters of leprechaun was also the best in this... I wish he was the same leprechaun in the movie ""leprechaun returns"" 2018 as well..
This was my childhood favorite..",Leprechaun
164,cuculiza_od,"One of the best ""So Bad That is Good"" movies of all time",8,14 February 2006,"What we have here is a masterpiece of the ""so bad that is good"" movies. It's incredibly entertaining, with awful (TRULY AWFUL) acting (trust me, you'll laugh hard with lines such as ""but I knew it was a man holding my leg, I swear it wasn't a cat!""), unintentionally funny script, of course bad directing, the plot is ridiculous, etc, etc. Everything in this movie is so bad that is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Aniston gives a great dramatic performances here (this must be one of her best movies, specially since she's making real crap like Rumor Has it or Derailed), and the main performance, given by Warwick is absolutely priceless. The makeup is great by the way. If you really are in the mood for good entertaining with no pretensions, go and rent this movie, it's an experience you won't regret.",Leprechaun
165,luciaquesadav,It's a funny horror movie,9,2 May 2020,"It's a low budget funny horror movie, great for those ocasions you want to sit back drink a beer and enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. The Leprechaun is an amazing villain and Warwick Davis does an amazing job as always.",Leprechaun
166,eadam87,Great way to spend an hour and a half,10,11 July 2002,"This is my all time favourite film, it is just so fun to watch. The setting I found to be excellent as were the characters and the acting. Warwick Davis is the real reason this film is so good. This was one of Anistons first films so you cannot expect her to be amazing.",Leprechaun
167,zbfelt,I'll give you a clue: It starts with BO and ends with RING,1,21 January 2006,"We rented this movie with four other bad horror movies. The others we rented either turned out to be actually good, or were bad enough to be funny. (Side note: ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"", as corny as the title sounds, turned out to be actually a good movie. ""Hack-O-Lantern"" is hilarious.) This was simply boring! It was decent enough to not make fun of, but far to boring to be enjoyable. The one part I found hilarious was when the Leprechaun bursts out of the barn on his tricycle in double speed. Other than that 4.5 seconds, I want the other hour and a half of my life back. I don't often sincerely mean that I want time of my life back, but this is one instance when I truly want to go back in time and not watch this movie.I wanted to see this movie partially because Jennifer Aniston is in it and I love her. Unfortunately, the young boy was a superior actor in this particular film. Sorry about your luck, Jen. But I guess we all have to start somewhere. To bad her first movie acting wasn't up to par with a 13yr old. :-P",Leprechaun

I know this movie isn't worth a 10, its not even close but this movie wasn't made to be remembered as a Godfather type movie. It was made in my opinion for just for laughs though there's a few gory and scary scenes but thats what most people miss about this movie and the whole series. It wasn't made to win all kinds of awards but as a movie to sit back and enjoy yourself, and enjoy a awesome villain.( the best in my opinion) If you watch this movie with a mind set that its not going to be great, you'll enjoy it a lot more.",Leprechaun
