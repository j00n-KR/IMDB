0,MartinHafer,"If you insist on watching a DEAD movie, then make it this one",8,2 August 2007,"No pun intended, but the brain-eating zombie genre has been beaten to death. After the seminal film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD appeared in 1968, there was a long hiatus until remakes (of sorts) and sequels began appearing in the 1980s and beyond. The problem is, just how many cannibal zombie movies do we need? If you ask some die-hard and rabid fans, they'll insist you can never have enough, though a more discriminating viewer might agree that the genre has been gasping for air for some time. Apart from SHAUN OF THE DEAD, the films are pretty much the same old same old and that is why I feel it's a public service to tell you that you really only need to see one of them and repeated viewing of the genre will probably result in massive death in brain cells. While this could be a positive thing in case of a zombie attack (after all, who wants an atrophied brain--even zombies have their standards), I would hope people would have a better use for their time than just watching one brain-eating movie after another. So, if you want to try just one zombie film, try watching THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. That's because like SHAUN OF THE DEAD, it is indeed a comedy (something this deadly serious genre needs) but unlike SHAUN, it has a cheesiness and cheapness about it that make it fun. The bottom line is that zombie films should NEVER have big budgets--it's everything that the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was not! Cheap, silly fun--see THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and then try turning off the TV and reading a book if the urge to watch more zombie films arises.",The Return of the Living Dead
1,TheLittleSongbird,Immensely enjoyable and by far the best in the series,8,23 August 2015,"This is saying a lot too, because to me this is the only film of the five Return of the Living Dead films to be above good standard. The sequels varied in quality, with 2 and 3 being acceptable enough though with their problems and 4 (Necropolis) and 5 (Rave to the Grave) being terrible, the latter being marginally worse and being one of the worst sequels ever made. The original however is an immensely enjoyable film, with its very few flaws barely noticeable amidst the huge amount of good.It is definitely the best-looking film in the series, it is stylishly shot and lit with a wonderful ominous atmosphere, complete with atmospheric sets, above average effects and some great make-up on the zombies. There is a killer 80s soundtrack that still sounds good and haunting rather than cheesy, and instead of the outdated quality it could have had the soundtrack makes one nostalgic for the 80s. As well as a hilarious and clever script that's never forced, doesn't get bogged down in too many explanations or too much exposition, and that is very quotable (which I don't think any of the sequels achieved and it was something that 4 and 5 could only dream of doing so), and a story that seemed tired in concept but felt very fresh in execution with so many funny moments and an equal number of highly disturbing and scary ones.Return of the Living Dead is directed with adroit class and a clear fondness for the genre by Dan O' Bannon, and while some of the punk teens are annoyingly and one-dimensionally written and acted with not much spark (the sole problems with the film, and they are not that major), the leads are written very likeably and Clu Gulager, James Karen, Thom Mathews and Beverly Randolph are charming and lots of fun (all of them at least knowing what sort of film they're in), Gulager and Karen are particularly good. Don Calfa is also suitably shady. The film also cleverly and wisely makes the zombies the stars and uses them brilliantly, furthermore these zombies actually are very menacing, a real threat, do a lot more than just shuffle and plod around and are wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, exuding real personality. The twist is deliciously ironic, adding to the freshness when it easily could have been tired or anti-climactic.All in all, immensely enjoyable and the best of the series by some margin, being the only one to be completely satisfying. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Return of the Living Dead
2,Leofwine_draca,"The perfect blend of comedy and horror, this is an outrageously good zombie flick",10,4 November 2016,"Oh boy! Made with a skill and attention to detail which immediately raises it above all similar fare (including the sequel), RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of the those essential horror movies that isn't afraid to play things for laughs. Sharing the same genre as the likes of other classics such as RE-ANIMATOR and EVIL DEAD II, this is a furiously plotted, hilariously acted masterpiece the likes of which don't come along very often! I'd probably say that this is THE movie that best sums up the punkish, counter culture feel of the '80s horror film, complete with dumb teenagers, dumber employees, and even dumber cops and paramedics. For once the heavy metal soundtrack fits in beautifully with the proceedings and its one of those endlessly quotable films that you'll be sampling with your mates in years to come.The cast is uniformly excellent, with the most memorable performers giving over-the-top performances. Whether it be weird bug-eyed embalmer Ernie, as played by Don Calfa, or nude punk Linnea Quigley in the role that rocketed her to scream queen fame, this is a film with some great and surprising turns. Clu Gulager keeps a recommendable straight face throughout in the serious leading role, whilst ghoulish over-the-top antics are provided by the inimitable teaming of Thom Mathews and James Karen. The special effects remain impressive and enjoyable and some are very well achieved – particularly the half-corpse on the operating table.The movie never lets up from the word go, with an excellent pre-credits opening, some great twists and successions as the initial accident turns into a major catastrophe, and the eventual chaos and destruction raining down on the lives of everyone involved. I loved the little things like the butterflies pinned on the board springing to life, or the split dogs. Most of the best laughs come from hilarious encounters with the living dead, whether it be the sawing up of the initial lively cadaver or the tar-man getting his comeuppance at the climax of the movie. Yet the film is also pretty gruesome and frightening with a zombie attack to rival those in Romero's films, on which this is obviously based. Original, mean-spirited, and most of all utterly enjoyable, this is one of my favourite horror comedies which gets better as the years progress and cinema just keeps getting worse.",The Return of the Living Dead
3,SnoopyStyle,Interesting zombie B-movie,6,18 October 2013,Freddy is a new employee in a medical supply company. Old timer Frank tells Freddy how a chemical had brought the dead back to life. César Romero's movie was a cover up and the army had sealed the bodies in barrels. The two bumbling idiots accidentally breaks the seal releasing the chemicals and reanimating the dead.Dan O'Bannon tries to take a different look at the zombie genre. This movie tries to take the zombie idea seriously by making chemically induced. But then how this one starts is really ridiculous. It takes awhile to get the zombies going. The first zombie looks good but most of the rest are just too limited. Dan O'Bannon may not be up to directing more than a B-movie. And that's what we have here.The 'kids' are just too ridiculously 80's. The dialog has a few campy lines but nothing too earth shattering. The final ending isn't very original either.,The Return of the Living Dead
4,claudio_carvalho,A Little Problem,7,7 June 2009,"On 03 July 1984, in Louisville, Kentucky, the supervisor Frank (James Karen) is explaining the new employee Freddy (Thom Matthews) his function of his first day working in the Uneeda Medical Supply. Frank shows the skeletons, cadaver and every sort of supplies provided by their warehouse to medical schools. Then he tells that ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) was based on a true event with 245 Trioxin and he shows canisters in the basement with dead bodies inside delivered by mistake by the army twenty-five years ago. When Freddy asks if the containers are safe, Frank hits one of them and a gas is released through a breach. They breath the chemical and faint; when they wake-up, they discover that the corpse in the refrigerated chamber has been reanimated. Frank calls the owner of the business Burt (Clu Gulager) telling that they have a little problem and he decides to saw the body. However the parts remain alive and Burt asks his neighbor Ernie (Don Calfa), who is the mortician of the Resurrection Cemetery, to burn the parts in the crematorium. However, a heavy rain soaks the smoke with ashes in the cemetery soil reanimating the buried corpses that need to eat human brains to relieve their pain. Meanwhile, Freddy's girlfriend Casey (Jewel Shepard) and their punk friends are waiting for Freddy, partying in the cemetery. The zombies put the morgue with the survivors under siege. When the army is informed of the situation, they brilliantly use their contingency plan to resolve the problem with minor casualties.""The Return of the Living Dead"" is a hilarious combination of horror and comedy with potential of cult-movie. The ironic story is a great joke with the trilogy of George A. Romero and makes reference to others zombie movies. The special effects and make-up are also excellent. The cast seems to have fun while shooting the scenes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Volta dos Mortos-Vivos"" (""The Return of the Living Dead"")Note: On 23 January 2017 I saw this film again.",The Return of the Living Dead
5,gavin6942,Probably the Best Zombie Film of the 1980s,8,24 March 2008,"Years after ""Night of the Living Dead"", the zombies return. They had been stored in the basement of a medical supply store, but the tanks could not hold them forever. Burt, Frank and a bunch of punk kids take on the undead. But what do you do when you cannot kill your enemy? Can you trust the police? Can you trust the army? Due to some sort of joint rights, ""Night of the Living Dead"" was split between John Russo (who is an incredibly nice guy) and George Romero (also a nice guy). Romero took the straight ""horror"" route and followed up the film with ""Dawn"" and ""Day of the Dead"". Russo took a more light-hearted approach, which personally I happen to appreciate a bit more. Is it cheesy? Yes. It it not nearly as scary? Sure. But it is a lot more entertaining and really brings out the 1980s, which is something I wish films today could do again.The film is a classic, and should be. Scream queen Linnea Quigley (as punk girl ""Trash) does her memorable strip scene, one character commits suicide in a sad but heroic manner. And there are split dogs. You know you need a movie with split dogs.I cannot think of what more to say just now, but suffice it to say you must view this movie. Can I place it in the top 100 horror films ever made? For me, personally, I probably can. I have seen it multiple times on VHS, DVD, and on the silver screen, and it never gets old. Pick up a copy and make your own decision.",The Return of the Living Dead
6,lee_eisenberg,So this is Louisville...,10,5 December 2005,"Okay, so this is a zombie movie. As we all know, that means lots and lots of gore. And in ""The Return of the Living Dead"", they play it to real cool effect. The plot of course has a pair of chemical plant employees accidentally opening a container, and a series of events brings all the cemetery residents back to life, meaning that Louisville, Kentucky, is overrun by brain-eaters.As with ""Army of Darkness"", you can't (in fact, shouldn't) take this movie seriously; it's intended as a joke. I remember when Joe Bob Briggs' show ""Monstervision"" showed this movie, he actually had Linnea Quigley as a guest (she plays Trash, the girl who strips in the cemetery). All in all, one cool movie. Clu Gulager may be the most interesting B-movie actor of all time.",The Return of the Living Dead
7,jboothmillard,The Return of the Living Dead,5,26 August 2021,"I think I first heard about or saw images for this film in the book Monsters in the Movies by John Landis. I knew this was more of a comedic interpretation of the zombie movie, evident with the poster's tagline ""They're back. They're hungry. And they're not vegetarian."" and it serves as a homage to George A Romero's 1968 cult classic Night of the Living Dead. Basically, on 3rd July 1984, in Louisville, Kentucky, at the medical supplier company Uneeda, foreman Frank (James Karen) is teaching new employee Freddy (Thom Mathews) the tricks of the trade. Whilst showing him military drums that wound up in the basement of the building, Frank accidentally unleashes the toxic gas in one of the barrels. The leak causes a cadaver stored in a meat locker to be reanimated and various other human and animal body parts to come to life. Frank and Freddy awaken from being knocked out, having breathed in the toxic gas, and find a zombie trying to attack them. They try the established method to kill it with a shot/blow to the head, but this is useless. They are forced to cut the reanimated body up, but it limbs continue to move. Joined by their boss Burt (Clu Gulager), the three go to the nearby mortuary of Burt's friend Ernie (Don Calfa), who agrees to burn every part of the living dead creature. But this inadvertently causes the deadly gas to contaminate the air, creating a toxic rainfall that reanimates the corpses in a cemetery. Meanwhile, a gang of punks: Spider (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.), Trash (Linnea Quigley), Chuck (John Philbin), Casey (Jewel Shepard), Scuz (Brian Peck), Suicide (Mark Venturini), and Freddy's girlfriend Tina (Beverly Randolph), arrive at the cemetery to meet Freddy at his job. While Trash starts stripping on a gravestone, and the others party and drink, Tina goes to the warehouse to find Freddy. She wanders into the basement, where she encounters the reanimated but horribly disfigured cadaver from the barrel that was assumed to have dissolved. The rest of the group arrives shortly after and saves her, although Suicide is killed. Soon enough, the group witness the rain falling causing zombies to crawl from the various graves and attempting to attack. Trash is killed and Chuck and Casey flee back to the warehouse, but Spider, Tina, and Scuz reach the mortuary. The three discover Frank and Freddy's health has deteriorated from exposure to the gas, and a test reveals that they are no longer medically alive. When Burt and Ernie learn of the dead rising from their graves, they barricade the mortuary thereafter. Scuz is grabbed by one zombie and pulled outside to his death, and the zombies eat the paramedics and police arriving on the scene. The zombies are able to speak and call for backup forces for them to fulfil their need to eat brains. With Frank and Freddy showing signs of becoming zombies themselves, Burt has them locked up in the chapel. Tina refuses to leave Freddy and is locked up with him, and soon a zombified Freddy attempts to eat her. Burt, Ernie, and Spider try to rescue her by reopening the chapel. Frank manages to escape during the chaos and, still having control over his mind, commits suicide. Burt and Spider flee the mortuary in a police car, but the large number of zombies forces Burt to leave Ernie and Tina behind. Ernie and Tina hide in the mortuary's attic, while a blinded Freddy attempts to break in. Burt and Spider manage to get back inside the warehouse where they find Casey and Chuck. After incapacitating the basement zombie, referred to by Spider as ""Tarman"" (Allan Trautman), Burt tries calling the police but learns they are being massacred by the zombies. Burt then decides to call the number on the military drums, which reaches military officer Colonel Glover (Jonathan Terry). Notified that the zombies have taken over the area, Glover orders the town destroyed by a nuclear bomb on the morning of July 4, effectively killing the survivors. Colonel Glover talks to his commanding officer saying that the nuclear strike on Louisville was successful, with only a small area was destroyed, with limited casualties, and the toxic rain, which burns skin on contact, is putting out the fires. But as he speaks, in the cemetery, zombies are heard screaming in their graves, indicating that the invasion is about to begin again. This reinvented certain established rules of the zombie movie, including the zombies having more speed, being able to speak, and eating brains rather than human flesh, so it feels fresh in some ways. It has lame acting and predictable dialogue, but perhaps that is the point, the punk stuff is distracting, and it is slow a lot of the time, but the gory stuff gets your attention, and it attempts to be funny at the right moments, I can see why it would appeal to scary movie fans, not a bad horror comedy. Worth watching!",The Return of the Living Dead
8,rmax304823,Avoid it,2,25 January 2002,"Every human being faces eventual dissolution.  Our most monumental curse is that we know it in a way, that say, a dog does not.  The funerary practices of our own civilization can be seen as attempts to build a cocoon around the dead to shield them from the living.  Even when we get to see the corpses they are coyly painted, drained, and stuffed.  They bear as much resemblance to the living person we knew as one of those ""serving suggestions"" on the carton of a prepared dinner bears to the actual contents.  The corpse lies there, quietly, soberly, as if deep in thought.  It does not sweat.  It does not have dandruff or bad breath.  And maybe that's the way we should remember the living.  Some commentors have found the scenes near the beginning of this film, in which the dead and buried, claw their rotting way out of the ground, to be haunting and beautiful.  I can't imagine why. This Romero clone is even more loathesome than the originals.  Zombies stagger about, banging on doors, falling to pieces, contaminating spaces with foul odors, offending the sight.  The supposedly amusing lines -- ""It HURTS to be dead!"", ""This isn't just a punk outfit, it's a way of life!"", and the German-accented embalmer listening to Wagner while he plies his trade -- are not in fact amusing.  You know who would find movies like this enjoyable? Those with perhaps the bodies and certainly the minds of twelve-year-olds. It's difficult to imagine an audience of mature people who have had any contact with dead bodies before they were prettied up finding anything to hoot and clap about.  Films about ghosts can be funny if embroidered with anything like elegant wit.  Films about rotting corpses doing their best to devour the living are kind of depressing, despite the wisecracks.  The final gag is the best.  The military, not knowing how to deal with this irruption of zombies in the small town, drop an atomic bomb and destroy the entire community.  There's a real knee slapper for you.",The Return of the Living Dead
9,BA_Harrison,One of the finest horror/comedies ever made.,10,30 September 2007,"When Frank (James Karen) and Freddy (Thom Mathews), employees working the weekend at the Uneeda Medical Supply warehouse, check out a canister stored in their work's basement, they accidentally release a toxic gas which not only causes the guys to suffer from some alarming symptoms (coldness, stiff joints, no heartbeat) but also makes dead bodies rise up and become brain-eating zombies.An un-official sequel (of sorts) to George Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), Dan O'Bannon's directorial debut, Return of the Living Dead, delivers a decidedly different take on the undead genre, packing in as much black humour as it does blood-red gore.Opening with the claim that ""the events portrayed in this film are all true"" and ""the names are real names of real people and real organizations,"" O'Bannon quickly establishes the movie's outrageous tone. Although this was a horror/comedy, it was never going to be a parody that mocked the genre. Rather, it would be respectful of its horror roots, both acknowledging and deriving its humour from the absurdity of the premise.The razor-sharp script delivers the goods in both the horror and comedy departments, succeeding in blending these genres where many others have failed. Much of the film's success can be attributed to its anarchic approach. There is an overall pervading atmosphere of hopelessness, nihilism and chaos, which is accentuated further by the marvellous punk rock soundtrack. O'Bannon also dispenses with the established rules of the genre, presenting viewers with a refreshing new take on the zombie mythos.In O'Bannon's movie, corpses don't walkthey run! Not only that, but they can think and talk too, making escape from the dead much harder than in Romero's zombie-verse. (Gone are the days when you could throw a custard pie in the face of a zombie and walk away laughing!). Furthermore, a bullet in the brain doesn't seem to stop these crittersonly total dismemberment or incineration will do.The top notch undead/gore effects are well handled and the movie delivers two of the greatest cinematic zombies of all time in the form of the gloopy ""Tar Man,"" who escapes from the breached canister, and the chatty ""half-corpse,"" who informs the survivors that it eats brains to relieve the pain of being dead.The cast is generally excellent, with 80s scream queen Linnea Quigley particularly memorable as Trash, a death-obsessed punk hottie who loves nothing more than to take her clothes off. Spending much of the film starkers, she is definitely one of the film's highlights.Dan O'Bannon has only directed one other film since his zombie masterpiece of '85, but even if he never returns to the director's chair, the sheer magnificence of Return of the Living Dead is enough to guarantee him an enduring place in the hearts of horror fans worldwide.",The Return of the Living Dead
10,paul_haakonsen,Brains...,7,31 December 2015,"""The Return of the Living Dead"" is an entertaining movie even though it is a bit old. But it is one of the more important of movies in the zombie genre, and it did of course introduce Trioxin and the tar zombie to us zombie aficionados.It has a good story which is entertaining from beginning to end, and it is nicely paced. Sure, it is a predictable story to be fair, but it still delivered entertainment where it mattered.The characters in ""The Return of the Living Dead"" were colorful and memorable. And even with years passing between watching the movie you will still remember these characters. And what is not to enjoy with a cast ensemble that includes Clu Gulager, James Karen, Don Calfa, Thom Mathews and Miguel A. Núñez Jr.?The effects were quite good for its age, and still do hold their ground by todays standards. ""The Return of the Living Dead"" introduced zombies groaning ""brains..."" which is a detail that you will come to find amusing.""The Return of the Living Dead"" is a movie that rightfully belongs in the movie collection of any zombie aficionado.",The Return of the Living Dead
11,Quinoa1984,A different and well done zombie movie,10,21 February 2000,"Return of the Living Dead may not be as good as Dawn of the Dead, I still liked it and thought it aught have got more credit than it got. 
The zombies were changed in this film though which made it better (the excuse is that Night of the Living dead was based on a true story).  Instead of meat eaters in general, these zombies only ate brains (the zombies also can talk), for reasons unknown.  It is cool though to see how a group of people try to protect themselves from the zombies in a morgue of a all places.  Another thing that makes this film good is that it slips in some sick humor in the mix and it works.  Scary, funny and shocking, this film may not be classy, but hey, how can you get classy with brain eating zombies.",The Return of the Living Dead
12,BandSAboutMovies,An all time greatest and most loved movie!,10,31 October 2018,"If you ever wondered where the fact that zombies like brains come from, look no further. This is the film that did it.July 3, 1984. Louisville, Kentucky. The Uneeda Medical Supply company. Frank (James Karen, Poltergeist) is showing off all of the strangeness within the warehouse to new employee Freddy (Thom Mathews, Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI). There are all manner of body parts, skeletons from an Indian skeleton farm, half dogs and drums containing the leftovers of a military experiment gone wrong, the kind of horrifying thing that they would make a movie about. A movie like, say, Night of the Living Dead. The problem is, Frank accidentally releases the gas in one of the tanks and reanimates corpses and bodies and half dogs throughout the warehouse.A quick call to the owner, Burt (Clu Gulager, The Initiation) provides only minor help. Trying to figure out how to control the situation and keep his business out of trouble, the three men hack a walking corpse to bits. But it just won't die - the movies lie! Even a shot to the brain can't stop the living dead. They turn to Ernie (Don Calfa, Weekend at Bernie's), a mortician friend, to burn the bodies - which releases the reanimation process into the open air and the graveyard next door.I never realized in all the times I've watched his that Ernie is supposed to be a Nazi in hiding. Now that I see the clues (he listens to the German Afrika Corps march song ""Panzer rollen in Afrika vor"" on his Walkman while embalming bodies, he carries a German Walther P38, has a photo of Eva Braun and refers to the rain coming down like ""Ein Betrunken Soldat"" (German for ""a drunken soldier""), it makes a lot of sense. Director and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon confirms this theory on the DVD commentary.Meanwhile, Freddy's friends learn about his new job from Tina, his girlfriend. There's Spider, Scuz, Suicide (Mark Venturini, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning), Casey (Jewel Shepard, Raw Force), Chuck and, most importantly, Trash (Linnea Quigley in the role of her career). The scene where she announces that the worst way to die would be for ""a bunch of old men to get around me and start biting and eating me alive. First, they would tear off my clothes..."" is one of the silliest and goofiest excuses to have nudity in a movie, but it works.As her friends blast 45 Grave and watch Tina disrobe on top of the grave of Archibald Leach (Cary Grant's real name), Tina looks for Freddy. However, she's been found by Tarman, the half-melted corpse in the barrel that started this whole mess. And it doesn't get any better, with zombies calling in paramedics to die (""Send more brains!"") and even the police getting destroyed by the undead. And if you think the military is going to do anything other than nuke the town to hide the truth, then you've never seen a zombie film before.This is a movie unafraid to feature shocks and laughs in the same frame. It comes from the writing team of John Russo and Russell Streiner, two of the names behind the original Night of the Living Dead. When Russo and George Romero went their separate ways, Russo got the rights to the name ""Living Dead"" while Romero would be allowed to make sequels. The original plan was for Tobe Hooper to direct this movie, but he would go on to make Lifeforce. Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon (Dark Star, Alien, Lifeforce, Total Recall and the Alejandro Jodorowsky chose to supervise special effects when he tried to make Dune) agreed to direct, but only if he could rewrite the movie so that it wasn't seen as a ripoff of Romero's film.This is a film packed with in-jokes, like how Freddy's jacket says FUCK YOU on the back of it and has a totally different jacket for the edited version that says TELEVISION VERSION on it. And there are even more little MAD Magazine-style bits throughout, like the hidden message on the eye test poster in Burt's office.I can't hide how much I love this movie. From the production designs to William Stout to the special effects work (including puppeteer Allan Trautman as Tarman), this movie moves fast, takes no prisoners and continues to surprise me. I always find something new with every viewing.",The Return of the Living Dead
13,Coventry,Feast your brains !!!,8,4 October 2003,"This is horror comedy at his best ! SPOILERS Coming up........... Return of the living dead handles about the same topic as the horror movie milestone by George A. Romero. The movie claims that the whole zombie experiment did really happen but that is was covered up. Due to a typical ""military-fault"" the infected corpse got lost. It's hidden in a basement in Louisville, Kentucky and of course...it comes to life !! This is only the beginning of the story....what follows is a fun movie with good make-up effects, lots of gore and several hilarious moments. The chemical that causes the dead to come to live again is getting spread through the air and because of heavy raining, it drips to the ground of an old burial ground. Corpses in a heavily state of decomposition rise again to hunt the living. They're only after them in order to eat their brains...it makes their pain go away ! Compared to the more ""traditional"" zombies, these puppies can talk and even run !! Above all that, you can't just simply destroy them by smashing their brains. END SPOILERS !!Return of the Living dead probably won't ever reach the status of Romero's films but that's ok. It does stand for one of the funniest and most creative movies coming from the 80's. It ain't very easy to make both a good horror movie and a comedy at the same time. Many directors try it but most of them fail...Sam Raimi can do it ( Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness ) and Dan O'Bannon can do it too now. By the way, this isn't just some small director !! He co-writed all-time classics like Dark Star, Alien and Total Recall. Return of the Living Dead was his debut in directing and I think he did a pretty good job. A terrific make-up department delivers us some of the nastiest looking zombies I've ever seen. And although this movie contains a lot of blood and gore, it never becomes hard to look at or disturbing. Cheesy, yes !! But we love that, don't we ? The acting performances are quite good considering it's an 80's horror movie and the character of this guy called ""Suicide"" is really original ! One troubled young man, that is. It all ends in a typically American way so everybody is happy !! Recommended to fans of (comedy)horror...",The Return of the Living Dead
14,Theo Robertson,Amusing Horror With Its Tongue Firmly In Its Cheek,7,14 August 2013,Two workers at a medical supplies warehouse accidentally release a gas that reanimates a cadaver . Trying to kill it by smashing its brain they dismember the corpse and incinerate at a nearby crematorium . Since the zombie is contaminated the smoke mixes with the rain and the chemical solution settles in the ground of the nearby graveyard causing the dead to reawaken and crave brains of the living This is a slightly weird post modernist horror film almost a meta-sequel to George A Romero's 1968 living dead film which is explicitly referred to as being based on fact . Within its own reality this is slightly nonsensical but ROTLD is so much fun this doesn't really matter because it's a horror film that does manage to mix and intertwine the rather difficult task of twinning horror with tongue in cheek humour While probably not being on a par with John Landis's 1981 black comedy about an American student on holiday in England becoming a Werewolf it's better than the Simon Pegg movie SHAUN OF THE DEAD probably because it's more streamlined and doesn't concern itself with meandering romance . It's also a film that contains some very grotesque make up and prosthetics and these zombies are scary simply because they're so slimy and hideous Where ROTLD may fall down slightly is a rather dated feel and the 1980s wasn't exactly the greatest decade for either fashion or music and like so many other films from the period which were perhaps influenced by APOCALYPSE NOW the soundtrack is a little bit too prominent for its own good . It's also a bit confusing that a very decomposed corpse with little muscle remaining would be able to move so rapidly but it goes without saying that you have to suspend all disbelief to enjoy a movie like this and it is relatively enjoyable,The Return of the Living Dead
15,Scarecrow-88,The Return of the Living Dead,7,23 October 2011,"Like a lot of my horror generation, I watched ""Return of the Living Dead"" a lot around the late 80s/early 90s during the heyday of HBO and VHS, so the movie, overrated or not depending on your feelings for the film, left a definite impression and the nostalgia factor alone endears it to me. Sure there's a ton of screaming, bickering, and profanity, not to mention, obnoxious characters who have a tendency to get on your nerves because they aren't exactly (or some of them, anyway) the most likable bunch.The situation itself, a fight for survival after the dead rise from their graves with a desperate hunger for brains to ease their never ending suffering (it is painful when you are dead and brains help to stave off the suffering as told to us by an upper torso zombie tied to a gurney when questioned), is, I think, the main appeal for this movie. Many zombie films have that sense of apocalyptic doom, but I think Dan O'Bannon's horror comedy gets that just right, in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Does the acting get a wee bit over-the-top? I'll just say that nothing holds James Karen back—he lets it all hang out with a performance steeped in campy theatrics. One thing, from this most recent viewing, I got a great sense of was the agony of dying yet remaining ""alive"" enough to feel the change in how Karen and Thom Matthews present to us the unending torture such suffering seems to be.The punks of the film (such as Miguel A. Núñez Jr., Brain Peck, and Mark Venturini) aren't exactly the most sympathetic bunch, the way they spout non-stop obscenities, rarely offering anything remotely attainable to an audience to care about their plight. Linnea Quigley's striptease and dance on the crypt in ""Resurrection Cemetery"" (what a cool and wickedly genius name for the cemetery!) is definitely one of those highlights perfectly etched in my memory since I saw it at an age when the beauty of a naked woman started to gain importance in my mind and libido (kudos to the actress for going all the way and remaining pretty much topless throughout her entire screen time). With a supporting cast like Clu Galagher (as the owner of the medical supply warehouse housing the canisters containing corpses with a chemical that awoke them from their dead sleep), James Karen (as the warehouse operator who spins tales to his young protégé, Freddy (Thom Mathews, who wide-eyed naiveté is perfect bait for an aging storyteller who loves to spook those willing to believe his stories), and Don Calfa (as the German Mortician who explains in detail the process of rigor mortis, carries on his person a German luger, and has a crematorium that seems like the ideal tool to get rid of moving dangerous zombie body parts), ""The Return of the Living Dead"" was certain to maintain a cult following because it is hard to keep a straight face with such absurd subject matter without the kind of actors who could sell scenes like the pick ax head stabbing and eventual hacksaw decapitation of a run-amok corpse kept in a freezer for college campuses to study, or a ""split dog"" used in veterinarian schools that is barking. With memorable moments feeding lines like ""Send more paramedics"" or ""Send more cops"" from zombies to headquarters to get more fresh brains for their disposal, where the undead attack helpless police and paramedics called to the cemetery, unknowingly walking into their gruesome demise, it is not hard to understand why this movie has had a lasting impact over several decades. The practical effects, particularly the memorable zombies like ""Tarman"" and the female skeletal upper torso that bites a chunk out of the skull of character Scuz, are the real stars of this film, if you ask me. The movement of Tarman is neat and the scene where the female upper torso is questioned by Calfa on why zombies need brains is actually rather tragic and sad (as is Karen's decision to use the crematorium to ""end it all"") is movie magic at its finest. The punk soundtrack and warped black comedy, the grisly violence and ever-present vulgarity will be certain to appeal and alienate depending on what kind of audience you are. This movie has endured—it is a zombie genre staple that continues to remain a favorite among many who grew up with it. I was so glad that there was a special edition provided for this film before O'Bannon's death, with audio commentary tracks and documentary specials that give us insight into the film's making and how it somehow remains a classic to many of us.",The Return of the Living Dead
16,Hey_Sweden,"It's not a bad movie, Burt.",10,30 November 2011,"In fact, it is indeed a freakin' classic, one of the most delightful 80's genre efforts, and a nice modern spin on zombie fare.A deadly chemical leaks out of misplaced Army canisters and proceeds to infect various unlucky people, including the corpses that had been resting peacefully under the Earth at a nearby cemetery. An unlikely bunch of would be dinners end up having to team up in order to try and survive.Marking the directorial debut for the late Dan O'Bannon, it injects a wonderfully quirky, comic sensibility into its raucous story, incorporating elements of farce into its mix with ease. It also populates its story with not the usual sex obsessed, personality deficient teenagers but a group of outcasts that is genuinely interesting and engaging. The pacing absolutely never lets up, delivering one riotous scene after another; this is energetic, spirited stuff. Even the zombies themselves - not the typical shambling kind, but relentless, speedy, and quite smart as well - are given a degree of personality. In addition to the movie's most popular zombie in the form of the foul, dripping Tar Man (Allan Trautman), we are treated to a Civil War soldier zombie, a half woman corpse with some of the most striking blue eyes one will ever see, and a midget zombie. The zombies even talk, and from one of them we're even given an explanation why they would crave brains in particular (this movie can take credit for introducing the ""eating of the brain"" idea into pop culture).Highly quotable dialogue is another plus, as well as the kick ass soundtrack featuring such cool groups as The Cramps, 45 Grave, Tall Boys, T.S.O.L., and others, and the extremely catchy Trioxin theme (Trioxin being the name of the chemical). The nicely chosen cast all work incredibly well together, including the under-rated veterans Clu Gulager (as the corporate weasel who cares only for saving his business at first but eventually turns into a real take-charge kind of guy), James Karen (delivering a memorable, delicious comic performance as the warehouse supervisor), and Don Calfa (as the mortician with a possible Nazi past). The younger generation is represented by Linnea Quigley, in her break through role as the kinky ""Trash"", the hilarious Mark Venturini (who unfortunately has also passed on) as Suicide, the ""spooky"" guy who just feels misunderstood, Thom Mathews as the ill-fated Freddy, cute Beverly Randolph, sexy Jewel Shepard, and Brian Peck, John Philbin, and Miguel Nunez, all of whom are fun to watch.The makeup effects and gore are excellently done, with some juicy gross 'em out moments. Culminating in an effectively ironic twist, ""The Return of the Living Dead"" is definitely one of those modern classics that veteran horror fans are sure to proudly display among their movie collection, and which newcomers to the genre really ought to check out. It's too good to miss.10 out of 10.",The Return of the Living Dead
17,preppy-3,Should be a cult classic,8,11 December 2003,"Back in 1985 this movie was deemed ""unreleasable"" by its studio. They (purportedly) re cut it and quietly opened it. To their surprise it was a sizable hit leading to two sequels. I saw it twice when it came out--this movie REALLY delivers the goods to horror fans.It starts off by saying all the events in this movie are true (???). It focuses on 2 warehouse workers played by Thom Mathews and James Karen. It turns out that the movie ""Night of the Living Dead"" was based on fact and the dead bodies are stored in the basement in air tight canisters with some gas keeping them asleep. One of the canisters breaks open, the dead guy comes to life and all hell breaks loose. Also, the gas leaks into a graveyard next door and all the dead people come to life...hungry for brains! And how about that group of punk kids hanging out in the graveyard--including Linnea Quigley who spends 99.9% of her screen time nude? Also, unlike ""Night of..."" these zombies move FAST and bullets don't hurt them...This movie is strange. It pays homage to old zombie horror flicks and goes of on its own direction. The annoying, constantly swearing bunch of punk kids are only there to be victims--and they inexplicably have an innocent, sweet girl with them--Tina played by Beverly Randolph. The first half is very funny--expertly mixing laughs with some truly scary, gory moments. The laughs disappear completely for the second half. Then on in its a gore show and VERY disturbing. It's moves extremely quick, there are tons of people killed, the number of zombies is incredible, the special effects are great and the blood goes flying. But the change from humor to horror is jarring and some of the stuff at the end is VERY disturbing (Karens and Mathews' slow deaths are very upsetting and painful to watch and hear). This movie is also helped by good acting. The punk kids are by the numbers (except for Randolph who is kind of fun), but Mathews is good and Karen and Gulager are hilarious in their respective roles. They all play it reasonably straight and it helps.Gory, scary, funny--a definite must-see for horror fans. This film deserves more recognition than it's gotten.Best line: ""I think things are getting a little out of hand.""",The Return of the Living Dead
18,poolandrews,"""It worked in the movies."" Highly enjoyable horror laced with humour.",8,15 July 2005,"The Return of the Living Dead begins with a paragraph of text that informs us 'The events portrayed in this film are all true. The names are real names of real people and real organizations.' The film then cuts to the front of a warehouse & a sign that reads 'Uneeda Medical Supply' whose motto is 'You Need It---We Got It'. Yet more text appears that informs us that it's 'July 3, 1984 5:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time' where Frank (James Karen) & Freddy (Thom Mathews) are preparing to shut up for the 4th July weekend. Frank starts to tell Freddy about some army barrels in the basement that contain zombies & were sent to the warehouse by accident, Freddy is obviously sceptical so Frank shows him the barrels. One of the barrels starts to leak & releases a cloud of green gas & a slimy zombie, nicknamed Tarman (Allan Trautman). The green gas also re-animates a cadaver (Terrence Houlihan), Frank & Freddy don't know what to do so Frank phones the boss Bert Wilson (Clu Gulager) who says they must destroy all evidence of what's happened for fear of what the authorities will do to the business. Bert decides to ask his friend Ernie Kaltenbrunner (Don Calfa) for a favour, since Ernie is a mortician he has access to a furnace which he lets Bert use to cremate the cadaver. However, this has the unfortunate side-effect of sending a cloud of green gas contaminated smoke & ashes out of the furnace chimney, into the atmosphere & when it begins to rain & soak into the soil of a nearby cemetery the dead start to rise. A gang of seven punks including Freddy's girlfriend Tina (Beverly Randolph), Chuck (John Philbin), Casey (Jewel Shepard), Spider (Miguel A. Nunez Jr.), Scuz (Brian Peck), Trash (Linnea Quigley) & the gang's leader who affectionately calls himself Suicide (Mark Venturini) happen to be partying in the cemetery & quickly learn that the living dead eat brains, human brains...Written & directed by Dan O'Bannon The Return of the Living Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made. The script is both humorous & horrific. It never descends into farce or slapstick unlike it's sequel Return of the Living Dead Part II (1988) but there are some funny moments here, it doesn't forget the horror elements either with plenty of creepy moments. It moves along at a very nice pace & is never boring or dull, the characters are surprisingly very likable except Frank who is just annoying but thankfully less so than he is in the sequel. I found the ending a little rushed & lazy & I don't understand why the zombies didn't disappear into the town looking for brains instead of sticking around the isolated cemetery in one big group but nothings perfect I suppose. One area where the film stands out from the crowd is that the zombies in The Return of the Living Dead are a little different than usual, these zombies can talk & have intelligence, they are fast moving & strong & are almost invincible. It still seems fresh & original now after 20 odd years, it has also definitely kept it's ability to entertain which it does in style. Director O'Bannon creates a horror film with plenty of atmosphere & maintains a ominous foreboding throughout. The blood & gore is so-so & a little spare when all said & done, there is a bitten open head with it's contents running out & some blood spurting but most of the violence in The Return of the Living Dead is against the zombies as they have pick-axe's buried in their heads, sawed into pieces, cut in half & have their heads knocked off with baseball bats. The special effects are pretty good even now & I just love that slimy zombie that comes out of the barrel! The acting is good, except James Karen who is highly annoying as Frank. Gulager as Bert & Calfa as Ernie in particular give good performances, do you get the cute Sesame Street gag? Technically the film is solid, nice cinematography, good locations & sets, great choice & usage of music & generally well above average production values for a relatively low-budget horror film. Overall I think The Return of the Living Dead is a top zombie film, not as good as Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) but not too far behind. Of the two sequels I think Part II is worth a watch while I love Return of the Living Dead 3 (1993) which I think is as good as this, if not a bit better. An absolute must for all horror fans & anyone interested in a few laughs with their scares.",The Return of the Living Dead

20,Boba_Fett1138,This movie really isn't well balanced.,5,5 April 2009,"This is a rather weak and lame that tries to combine comedy with gory zombie-horror. Problem is that the balance between these two different genres isn't very good, meaning that the movie doesn't work out the way it was supposed to.The idea was pretty good, the execution of it however really wasn't. The movie can be seen as on 'unofficial' sequel to the George A. Romero movie ""Night of the Living Dead"" and its sequels. Those movies of course already had a healthy dose of comedy in them and this movie tried to take its comedy one step further. The comedy is however to lame to consider it funny really, which is also due to its fairly poor production values and poor actors involved.The movie is rather cheap looking and there really isn't enough gore or good make-up involved to please any zombie movie/gore fan. It has a bit of a B-movie feel and look over it, which of course gets also strengthened by its silly script and comedy.The character are often more annoying then likable enough which, again, is due mostly to its weak writing and lame comedy. Seriously, this movie features the type of jokes and dialog that seems to be written by an 10-year old, in just one afternoon.I like horror and I like cult-horror perhaps even better. This movie however really doesn't deserve to become a cult-horror classic. It's far too lame and weakly made for that.If you want to see a good and above all effective cross of comedy and zombies just stick to ""Shaun of the Dead"".5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Return of the Living Dead

The Return of the Living Dead zombies are anything but.Billed as a comedy, horror, sci-fi flick I should've been OK with this low budget semi-spoof of zombie movies: but I wasn't. It just wasn't spoof or comedy enough. I wanted more Zombieland or Aaah! Zombies!! type comedy.In this walking dead film the zombies were fast, strong, intelligent, and unkillable. The fleshier zombies (i.e. those recently killed) movie extremely swift and could full on run. They were all strong enough to break through barriers regardless of their state of decay (even skeletons with barely any flesh on them could easily move about). They all exhibited a considerable amount of intelligence by using guile, cunning, and developing simple tools. And worst of all; puncturing the brain did nothing to stop them.I know that not every zombie movie follows the same rules and that's OK but give me at least one of my four requests. These were super zombies.",The Return of the Living Dead
22,AlsExGal,A campy take on the horrible story behind the 1968 classic,8,22 September 2018,"Freddy is starting his first day of work at a Medical Supply Warehouse. The older employee, Frank (James Karen), is showing Freddy around. Wanting to impress him - maybe scare him a little too - Frank shows Freddy a drum that he says contains a military biological experiment gone wrong. The two manage to accidentally open the drum which floods the warehouse with toxic gas. Frank and Freddy awake after being knocked out and find the drum empty, but also find that the cadaver in the freezer is now alive, as well as a partially dissected dog. The two call Burt, the boss, to help, and when the freezer door is opened, the cadaver rushes out and attacks Burt, but seems to ignore Frank and Freddy. Hmmmm.Meanwhile in the adjoining cemetery, Freddy's girlfriend, Tina, and Freddy's punk rock friends minus the rock are waiting for him among the tombstones. This film changes the 1968 story in a few ways. Now the reanimated dead are after human brains, not just human flesh in general. Also, cutting off their heads does nothing. Every piece left just comes after you. Also, the reanimated dead are quite eloquent, even if they are just half of a skeleton. Like the original story, those killed by the zombies become zombies themselves, so geometric progression is a problem. And finally one big event occurred between 1968 and 1985 - Watergate. In the original film the government gets on TV and levels with the public and the public believes them. In this film, it would be wise not to be as honest as Burt wants to be with the military about the predicament the cast gets themselves into. With Don Calfa as Ernie (Burt and Ernie? Was this intentional?) a pistol wielding mortician at the crematorium next door whose detailed description of rigor mortis does have a point, so pay attention. He also has the best line in the film - ""Why do you eat people?"".Recommended for fans of the horror genre.",The Return of the Living Dead
23,morrison-dylan-fan,The Living Dead Series:Part 1.,10,8 November 2015,"During the IMDb Horror board October Challenge I got the chance to watch a number of excellent movies starring ""Scream Queen"" Linnea Quigley.Talking to a fellow IMDber,I got told about one of Quigley's most well-known titles that I had somehow overlooked,which led to me getting ready to see the living dead return.The plot:Sorting out human skeletons to be sent to medical schools,Frank tells new employee Freddy that the factory they are working in has a basement filled with military canisters which contain an army toxin that went wrong,which on the one time it was unleashed,inspired a group of film makers to shoot Night of the Living Dead.Going down to the basement,Frank & Freddy clean the drums up,and discover that the toxin is actually zombies.Moving the drums around,Frank accidentally opens one of them up,which leads to him and Freddy suddenly being knocked out.As Freddy lays KO'ed,his pals Tina,Spider,Suicide, Trash, Scuz, Casey and Chuck decide to drive down and pick Freddy up from work.Arriving early,the gang decide to wait round for Freddy by hanging out at a near by graveyard.Waking up,Frank and Freddy find the tin drums empty. Initially believing that the zombies have melted away,Frank and Freddy soon discover that along with unleashing the zombies,that they themselves will soon join the walking dead.View on the film:Looking like a prime piece of Pop-Art,Linnea Quigley (who also appears naked) gives a terrific performance as Trash,whose swinging dance moves and flaring red hair perfectly set the wonderfully strange atmosphere of the film.Joining Quigley, Miguel A. Núñez Jr. (who was homeless when he got the role) gives a whip-smart performance as Spider,whilst Don Calfa gives the movie a touch of the ""Mad Scientist"" as Ernie.Backed by a sinister score from Matt Clifford and roaring Punk Rock songs,co-writer/(along with Rudy Ricci/John A. Russo and Russell Streiner)director Dan O'Bannon & cinematographer Jules Brenner open up a stylised,blood-drenched Comic Book.Splashing the credits over the title in dripping red,O'Bannon and Brenner turn the movie into a dazzling living cartoon,thanks to Punk leathers,burning blood and slimy gore being drizzled across the screen.Along with the animated atmosphere,O'Bannon also digs his teeth into vicious horror,with O'Bannon giving each of the zombies unique,eye-gauging designs from half cut dog skeletons to a deformed bodybuilder-like super zombie.For the screenplay of the film,the writers smartly decide to make the characters well aware of what zombies are from movies,which leads to hilariously frantic chase scenes,as the surviving humans discover that all the ""guides"" that the films gave in how to defeat a zombie are completely useless in real life.Whilst the movie largely has a colourful mood,the writers hit the film with some sly satirical jabs,by having the army/government be completely disconnected to the terror taking place on the ground,and the device that they use to kill the zombies (complete with cartoon sound effects!)making the situation go from bad to worse,as the living dead return.",The Return of the Living Dead
24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A really impressive genre entry,10,27 November 2015,"Working in a medical supply warehouse, the last ones left find the leftover government chemicals stored there have seeped free into a local cemetery during a party and forces them to team with the party survivors to stop the ravenous zombies on the loose.This here was quite the fun and extremely enjoyable zombie effort. Over of the most impressive aspects to this one is the really enjoyable time here due to the exciting pace on display, which comes there through the near-continuous action. As there's the gas-release here less than ten minutes into the film, there's already the rather fun action of the two trapped inside the warehouse with the reanimated props along the storage unites of the facility while also allowing for the big brawl with the nude cadaver running throughout where they're forced to dismember it in order to get him under control, which is all done in the first half hour here. Following the introduction of the chemical into the cemetery and their resurrection, it allows for the great chase in the mortuary with the reanimated tar-man, the graveyard chase where the graves spit out the dead to chase and swarm the group against the different of monuments and tombstones as well as the swarming scenes of the paramedics in the truck and forcing the really fun time here with the big assault on the church. From the barricading tactics against the grabbing hands attempting to break into the room, the attack in the storeroom where they're able to capture the live skeleton for questioning and the zombie attacks out in the graveyard and the adjacent streets, there's a ton of high-energy action in this section which features a ton to like with the violent antics, building suspense of the creatures getting in and the few nicely developed scenes of comedy here all make for a great time along with the great finale. This here is the film's highlight offering as the zombies running wild in the streets taking out the police reinforcements, holding traps for the police officers coming to check on the previous ventures into the cemetery and the ones breaking into the mortuary as they're trapped inside which has a lot more action, tons of zombies and fun all throughout here. Coupled with the outstanding gore, fantastic zombies and one of the genre's most iconic nude scenes, these here hold this off over a few minor flaws. The main issue here is the brief finale, which is quite sudden and doesn't really bring out all the great points of the story along the way. As well, there's the fact that this one goes along with some stupid ideas to make the story work, from staying in the room with the zombies despite all the evidence known that's proved to have them turn on her as well and the lame attempts at being stonewalled by the army, which are just pointless and goes nowhere here as the attempt to shoehorn them into the film the way it does here is pretty lame and not-well-thought-out. With the low-budget gore effects sometimes coming through obviously, these here are somewhat minor and insignificant problems against the positive points.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, Full Nudity and drug use.",The Return of the Living Dead
25,Aaron1375,Kind of a mixture of 70 and 80's horror films,9,19 October 2016,"Clu Gulager kicks butt as Burt and Linnea Quiqley heats things up! This zombie film kind of fuses two eras of horror together for a very fun zombie film and the only zombie series that I know of that really has zombies chomping on brains, yet the film had to have made an impact because a lot of people will say that zombies eat brains, when in most zombie films they simply eat people. How is this a merger you ask? Mainly in the way it was cast. In the 70's, a lot of horror films would feature a notable actor or two in a prominent role. They may of not been an A list star, but it was someone a person would recognize. In the 80's the casts became young stars who were usually not very recognizable. This movie features both sets and they kind of do their own thing until the middle of the film where the two groups meet and clash for the remainder of the film. The film also was one of three zombie films released during 1985 and I will say that this one had the best cast, I would say Day of the Dead had the best zombie effects and action and I would say Reanimator had a bit better visuals than Return and a better cast than Day. This one and Reanimator would feature humor, while Day is the bleak film of the trio. All three I find good and I have a hard time picking which one I do enjoy more.The story has a couple of guys in a medical warehouse where one of them is showing the new guy the ropes. While doing some paper work, Freddie (the new guy) asks Frank what is the strangest thing he had ever seen. Frank tells him of a story about how Night of the Living Dead was based on true events and proceeds to show him some tanks in the basement of the building that contain dead corpses. Unfortunately, the young guy then asks if the canisters could leak, which the older gent then says, ""No way"" before hitting the canister and it proceeds to shoot out its contents. This fog envelopes the warehouse and revives some of the dead objects within including butterflies, split dogs and a cadaver! The two men lose consciousness before reviving and calling the owner of the warehouse and after a few humorous incidents, they take the reanimated objects to Ernie, the local mortician to burn the items which sends fumes into the air and revive the dead! Caught up in all this is Freddie's girlfriend and I am going to guess his friends as she sticks out like a sore thumb. Soon the two groups meet up and must try to work together to try and survive the zombie onslaught! The film starts out with a lot of comedy in it, but as it goes on it becomes a bit darker and soon nearly all the humor is gone. The sequel to this film would keep the humor all the way through it and it was pretty much less of a sequel and more of a spoof of this film. The cast in that one was not as good either as sure James Karen would return as would Thom Matthews in what is essentially same roles, but the one who made this one great was Clu Gulagar. Linnea was good too, but mainly for that one dance sequence in the cemetery and for still having a great bod even as a zombie. Though I still say the female zombie from Junk was the hottest zombie as she still had a cute face too.This is a favorite of mine and memorable as I actually saw this film at the theater when it came out. My parents and I actually saw a trailer for this one while watching the low budget, but still good, zombie film, Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things. It almost looked like it had the same premise, but this one turned out vastly different. I still remember my mother attempting to cover my eyes during Linnea's dance. The tone is a bit uneven as it does start out in a more humorous way and it does get rather dark towards the end, but overall it was a very fun zombie film. The zombies looked good in this one at times with the tar man being the highlight as well as the blond one that they talked too, but a lot of the zombies in this one you could tell were just people smeared with mud. That is okay, as with this one it is not the zombies as much as the cast and their reactions that make this one.",The Return of the Living Dead
26,The_Void,It's rather silly...,8,30 August 2004,"After writing the script for Alien, Dan O'Bannon would go on to direct this rigorously silly spoof of George A. Romero's zombie films. The plot follows the 'true story' behind Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"". The story leads us to believe that the army, after creating a toxin that has the power to bring corpses back to life, had a spill which resulted in them having to put several of the re-animated corpses into metal cans. However, due to a military mix-up, the cans were delivered to a medical supply facility somewhere in Louisiana. The same facility where 'cool kid'; Freddy, has just got himself a job. Naturally, the cans get breached which leads to lots of zombies rising up from the ground to feast on the living.This zombie comedy successfully (usually) manages to simultaneously poke fun at the genre, along the way exposing many clichés, and also be a horror movie at the same time. Although predominantly a comedy, without a doubt, the movie does find a lot of time for extreme gore and horrifying sequences such as a group of zombies munching on brains, or the part where two of our hero's make an agonising transition from being living to being zombies. The film does also feature a lot of ingenious scenes that are really quite original, such as the part where a zombie talks about how it feels to be dead and why they like to feed on brains, and also the part where rigor-mortis starts to set in on some of our less fortunate hero's. For a lot of the movie, however, it's tribute territory, with a lot of the sequences echoing the zombie classics to which this film owes itself.Aside from spoofing the zombie genre, the film also finds time to take a swipe at youth culture, most notably the leather-wearing, hair-dying, new-age teenybopper types (of which feature heavily in this film). The best example of this is when the leader of the party makes a speech about how misunderstood and under-spoken he is, and how what he wears is a way of life and not just a costume. It doesn't add anything to the film, but it is funny. The other characters in the movie are mostly young kids, but there are also three older people, which make the film a bit more varied in terms of characters.Return of the Living Dead became an instant cult classic upon release, and still more than holds up to most of the newer zombie films today. It's unique in that it has heavy comedy themes that most zombie films don't have. I recommend this movie to any fan of the horror genre, and I also recommend it's third sequel, which is the best of the series. Skip part 2, it's just more of the same except not as good.",The Return of the Living Dead

It isn't, but the writer owned the rights to the 'living dead' part of the title (hence the reason all George's later offerings were simply '...of the Dead').But, studio politics aside, RotLD takes the modern zombie genre that George is often credited for creating and refreshes it. In fact, it refreshes it so much that, to this day, it still hasn't been beaten.It's about a group of punks who go partying in a graveyard one night, right next to a warehouse where a chemical leak resurrects the graveyard's sleeping occupants. There's nothing too original in the plot - in fact, it's pretty cheesy. However, it's the way the whole film is executed which sets it apart. There's so much right with it that what little bits that don't work are easily overlooked.The characters are believable and, almost all the time, do logical, sensible things. Also, it's the 'oldies' who steal the show. In a world where teenagers are normally the stars of horror films, it's the older, wiser characters that both get the better lines and come through as the heroes. It has some pretty interesting situations, where the zombies are 'explained,' plus they're well and truly 'pumped up' compared to George A Romero's 'shufflers.' These guys don't die from a head shot and some of them can even solve puzzles.Not only is the film littered with pokes at Night of the Living Dead, plus generally horror films, but there are also some genuinely humorous moments on their own. Not that this is just a strict comedy. The tone is overall very dark and depressing. The sheer strength and invulnerability of the zombies compared to the humans makes it an almost lost cause for our heroes to fight against.There are so many zombie movies flooding the DVD racks these days, you may be forgiven for thinking that an obscure one from the mid eighties with no stars in it has much place in the horror genre. I think you'll find you're wrong. If half the modern zombie offerings had even a fraction of the class and originality of RotLD, they'd actually get out of the Bargain Basement bins in DVD stores.",The Return of the Living Dead
31,gbill-74877,Entertaining zombie fun,6,11 October 2021,"A fun zombie film, and in this case the zombies are far more agile and intelligent than in Romero's classic 1968 version. They make it clear they want to eat brains, they call the authorities and ask for more cops to be sent over to provide more victims, and they do the requisite amount of maniacal swarming over anyone living who makes the mistake of trying to confront or escape them. There are a few shock moments which work, but at the end of the day it's hard to get too surprised when the basic premise is so understood. The film is also hampered by weak acting and a soundtrack geared more towards having a party than increasing the terror of what's on the screen. It's definitely a 1980's time capsule though, and I loved its subversive ending.",The Return of the Living Dead
32,Cineanalyst,Gives Brains to the Zombie Genre,7,2 May 2020,"This is one of the most fun, light-hearted zombie flicks ever made. Besides opening the door to all sorts of different depictions of zombies post George A. Romero's prior landmarks in the subgenre, by making the zombies talk, run, think intelligently and eat brains, I also appreciate how ""The Return of the Living Dead"" references Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968)--even if one character mixes up its dating--while largely ignoring the template set by that first modern zombie film. Instead of the classic-horror-cinema-inspired, black-and-white straightforward gore and equally grizzly racial subtext of Romero's picture, this return is more of a punk-rock comedy. Of course, it's still gory, too, and Linnea Quigley plays one of the punks nude for most of the proceedings. Obviously, the soundtrack stands out, as well.Besides being funny and stylish, this is a well-paced picture. There's nary a dull moment. It jumps right into the two main concurring plots of the warehouse workers and the punks, as the zombie-causing fumes are inadvertently and repeatedly released by the former and as the latter's party in a graveyard is subsequently interrupted by the resulting acid rainfall and reanimated corpses emerging from the ground. There's also the military operation that, temporarily at least, defeated the last zombie outbreak that Romero's film was supposedly based on. Thereafter, it becomes a battle of minds: the living trying to keep theirs, and the zombies trying to eat them.",The Return of the Living Dead

34,paulclaassen,Satirical horror comedy.,5,13 June 2020,"'Return of the Living Dead' is considered a cult classic, and it's easy to see why. It is a film to be viewed lightheartedly, as it is a satirical horror comedy. As a result, the acting was very theatrical, but I believe this to be intentional to complement the film's mood. I mean, the guys scream like high school girls!!!Comedy horrors were immensely popular in the 80's. This is another perfect example - maybe even taking it to the next level. The film delivers comedy and horror in equal proportions. Some of the zombie effects are scary and good, some are pretty obvious just a guy in a suit with make-up. Again, maybe here it was intentional.'The Return of the Living Dead' is a seriously messed up film. How can a film this bad be so entertaining? This is the kind of film where you just have to sit back, and go along for the ride. I do enjoy the 80s movies without CGI overload and mobile phones...",The Return of the Living Dead
35,tomgillespie2002,One of the quickest 90 minutes you'll ever experience,8,18 September 2012,"At the Uneeda Medical Supply warehouse, new employee Freddy (Thom Matthews) is shown the ropes by manager Frank (James Karen). In an attempt to impress the brainless but lovable punk, Frank takes him down to the basement where he claims lies the remains of the result of a zombie outbreak, stored by the military, that was the inspiration for the movie Night of the Living Dead (1968). The sealed drums that contain the zombies begin to leak, causing a gas to pour into the warehouse and awakening the dead. Owner Burt (Clu Gulager) arrives in disbelief at the awakened corpse stored in the freezer, and after an unsuccessful attempt at killing it, they take the butchered corpse to the local mortician Ernie (Don Calfa), who incinerates it, causing zombie smoke to leak into the city, and into the nearby cemetery.After the success of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, co- writer John A. Russo and Romero agreed that Russo would obtain the right to any film with the title ...of the Living Dead in it, while Romero will continue his own zombie series. 18 years later, The Return of the Living Dead was made, a film that embraced Romero's 'rules', yet making certain tweaks to form an original zombie film in its own right. Here, the zombies can run, speak, think, and having a craving for brains. This film is also a comedy, and a very funny one at that, that both pokes fun at the genre and embraces its charm. While Romero's zombies drag their feet and gaze gormlessly in their eternal search for meat, here we have zombie 'characters' such as the Tar Man and the Half-Corpse - the latter of which manages to explain their longing for brains to the horrified Ernie.Such is the silliness of the film, and it's an aspect that makes this one of the funniest and most effortlessly enjoyable genre films of its type. There isn't the usual bunch of stock stereotypes that make up the gang you wait eagerly to be killed, but a gang of lovable throwaway characters performed by quality actors (especially Gulager, a former star in the 50's and 60's who took full advantage of the low-budget horror boom in the 1980's). It also has the sexiest zombie ever, not that I can think of any others. So if you like your horror with its tongue firmly in its cheek, and chocked full of clever set-pieces and darkly funny humour, as well as enough blood and guts to satisfy the casual gore-hound, then this is probably the best film ever. For most other people, this will be one of the quickest 90 minutes you'll ever experience.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Return of the Living Dead

George A. Romero (director of 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"") apparently wanted nothing to do with this project, so O'Bannon was going solo and for the most part, he flies on the straight & narrow.We know that in 1968 on the Pennsylvania countryside, the living dead descended on a farmhouse and terrorized the people trapped inside. ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), added humor and satire as the four leads resolved themselves to living like fat rats inside an abandoned shopping mall while hordes of zombies roamed the outside world. In ""Day of the Dead"" (1985), the action was moved to an underground missile silo where scientists and the military pondered what to do as zombies roamed the topside world.Now here we are at ""The Return of the Living Dead,"" released the same year as ""Day,"" a punk variation of the material with plenty of laughs, gore, and BRAINS!First things first, a toxic waste spill in rural Kentucky brings the permanent residents of a local cemetery back to life, hungry for human BRAINS. Don Calfa is Ernie Kaltenbrunner, a worker at the mortuary where his buddy Burt (Clu Gulager), two bumbling medical-supply warehouse workers (James Karen and Thom Mathews), and a group of punk rock teenagers must fend off the re-animated corpses of the living dead.But these are no ordinary zombies. O'Bannon's own personal stamp of approval on the material comes from the fact that these zombies can talk, think, run, and work together to dine on human BRAINS. (This is an out-of-this-world concept that James Gunn saw fit with his work on the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead."") Considering the reputation of zombie movies in recent years, I was glad to finally see this movie after putting it off for much of my adult life. I was also surprised to find this effort working from the very first moments. It has some laughs that are pretty well out-there, and special effects that are not only satisfying in the gore department, but are also pretty inventive.And speaking of BRAINS, O'Bannon's script is littered with it, literally and figuratively. But these are characters who aren't too intelligent (""The Return of the Living Dead"" works on the premise that Romero's film DID happen and the military covered it up), so they sometimes, unwisely, look to that movie for answers. So what it boils down to is improvisation. And they do find some clever ways to try to survive, even though the movie still ends on a rather downbeat note. The punk soundtrack is also worthy of some mention, since it fires up during some of the most intense action.""The Return of the Living Dead"" may not be as sophisticated as its source material, but there's no question that this movie has BRAINS.10/10P.S.: Scream queen Linnea Quigley, put some clothes on!",The Return of the Living Dead

There are some pretty cool special effects throughout the film, and some legendary shots, but the look of the film itself is rather bland- never really dabbling anywhere from a small circle area of bland colors. The film can be a sort of campy fun at times, but not entertaining enough unfortunately to hold itself together by the end.

51,a_chinn,Do ya wanna party? It's partytime! Campy punk rock and zombie nostalgia rolled into one.,8,17 February 2020,"Classic 80s horror film is less of a Romero-style zombie films and is more of a very Rated-R zombie comedy. Writer/director Dan O'Bannon (""Alien"" ""Blue Thunder"" ""Lifeforce"") was handed a script by John A. Russo, co-writer of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" film, who's script was a direct sequel to that film, but O'Bannon didn't want to intrude on Romero's Dead films and changed Russo's story completely, with the exception of retaining the title, as well as radically changing the tone of the zombie story to a black comedy. The story finds 80s punk rocker Thom Mathews on the first day of his new job at a medical supply warehouse, being shown the ropes by the fabulous character actor James Karen. When a dusty military canister at the warehouse is breached (""Do these things leak?"" ""Hell, no. These things were made by the US Army Corps of Engineers!""), it releases a gas that triggers a set of events that brings the dead back to life (there's a conveniently located graveyard and mortuary right next-door to the warehouse). Without ruining the story, it follows a standard siege film story of trapped survivors surrounded by danger on the outside, but O'Bannon does a fabulous job of building suspense and delivering solid horror scares along with genuinely funny black humor (""Send more cops.""). One super fun element is the inclusion of 80s punk rock culture, even if it's a cartoon version of it, which back in the days a fun riff on Repo Man vs. the Living Dead, but the 80s punk elements now have added nostalgia value, making it even more fun. The punk rocker and waveos in the film are friends Mathews, waiting for him to finish his shift, one of whom is 80s screen queen Linnea Quigley, and who end up having to use their punk rock FU-attitued to survive a zombie outbreak. There's also a memorable soundtrack featuring songs by The Cramps, T.S.O.L., The Dammed, and 45 Grave (who I don't remember from back in the day) who sings the film's memorable theme song, Partytime. Another memorable song is from another band I don't remember, SSQ, who sing Tonight (We'll Make Love Until We Die), for Quigley's classic dance sequence in the graveyard. And as with all memorable zombie films, this one features a number of memorable zombies, including the drippy Tarman who emerges from the military canister, the tied up ½ Lady Corpse who the survivors talk to while trying to figure out what's going on, and the fleetingly glimpsed Legless Corpse that pops up and chases Calfa. This also brings up the point that ROTLD boasts some excellent practical special effects. Besides the aforementioned zombies (the ½ Lady Corpse actually inspired the bicycle zombie in The Walking Dead), there are half-dogs, and the quivering ""rabid weasels,"" which although not earth shattering are extremely effective special effects. The film was photographed by veteran cinematographer Jules Brenner, who's worked on ""Johnny Got it Gun,"" ""Salem's Lot"" and ""Dillinger"" and there's a fun score by Matt Clifford, which is interestingly his only film credit. I was curious why he worked on another feature film, so I looked it up and he's a longtime musical collaborator with Mitch Jagger and is the touring keyboard player with The Rolling Stones, so he definitely has cooler things to do than compose soundtracks for cheesy horror films. It's also worth noting strong performances by Don Calfa as a twitchy mortician and Clu Gulager as the hand wringing warehouse owner. While dearly love this film, it does have some weak performances, some of the special effects are a bit underdeveloped, and once the zombie siege begins the film loses some of it's originality and slips too easily into siege film tropes. However, ""Return of the Living Dead"" is a wildly fun comedy horror film and is essential viewing for zombie movie fans. It's Gen-X classic that still holds up. FUN FACT! Though often forgotten, ROTLD was the first film where zombies specifically wanted to eat brains, popularizing the notion that zombies eating brains.",The Return of the Living Dead
52,ctomvelu1,A fun time for all,7,2 October 2010,"To this day, I can't believe Dan O'Bannon got away with using ""The Living Dead"" in his title. George Romero should have sued, and probably did. Nevertheless, this is a classic horror comedy straight out of the 1980s, with gruesome brain-devouring zombies running riot in a small town. Actually, due to the movie's modest budget, the zombies run around a small number series of sets, consisting of a warehouse, both inside and outside, a bridge and a mortuary, inside and outside. There also are a couple of shots dealing with Army personnel. An Abbott and Costello-type pair unleashes a government-developed gas that revives the dead. Even dead parts. A warehouse exec, a mortuary owner and several daffy young people end up in a fight for their lives, while a series of EMTs and police arriving on the scene are quickly dispatched by the ravenous zombies. The hammy acting is strictly from hunger, the dialog largely improvised, and the clumsy blocking and static photography (mostly medium shots) are like something from a 1932 talkie. But the zombie attacks are ferocious and go way beyond anything Romero attempted in ""Night."" Also, zombies getting on the ambulance and police radios to order up more help in their sepulchral voices is beyond hilarious. You also have the ravishing Scream Queen of her day, Leanna Quigley, spending most of screen time nekkid. It also is a riot to see familiar grocery store hawker James Karen in a prominent role here. Plus, much has been said over the years about the individual hired to play the rotting basement zombie, and he is indeed absolutely marvelous. Good for a laugh, and great for trotting out every Halloween.",The Return of the Living Dead

54,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Acid Rain,9,4 July 2014,"First off, the short little story told in this movie about the Darrow Chemical Company making Trioxin 2-4-5 is an allegory for the Dow Chemical Company in reality involved in the manufacture and testing of Dioxin 2-4-5, or Agent Orange, which was tested in Vietnam and Gagetown a small army base town in Eastern Canada. Most people don't notice this little detail.Anyway, the plot starts out with a redneck punk kid getting a new job at a medical supply warehouse in Kentucky. While in there his new co-worker Frank tells him the story of the fictional Darrow Chemical Company responsible for storing bodies laced with a deadly chemical into drums in the basement. Eager to show this off to the new employee, he leads him to the basement where the boy, Freddy, asks if the drums leak... no, they were made by the army!So of course, one leaks.And then we meet Freddy's teenage punk-goth friends, who decide to go pick up Freddy from work and party in the nearby cemetery to wait for his shift to finish. Meanwhile Frank and Freddy are dealing with a bunch of lab specimens being brought back to life, including a human body. Finally they call the company owner, a cheery guy named Bert who suggests they burn up the bodies. This introduces Ernie, the sullen but friendly mortician who by burning the bodes of the lab specimens accidentally releases more of the Trioxin chemical into the air over the graveyard where the punks are hanging out. Mayhem ensues as the buried bodies in the cemetery begin to rise and Frank and Freddy start getting sick. Bert befriends Scuz, one of the punks, and they team up to try and get the remaining in the group out to safety. Unknown to them, the army is planning a deadly surprise to end the toxic rainfall once and for all.The film is incredibly cheesy, but is supposed to be. It makes fun of films like Zombi, Hell of the Living Dead and Night of the Living Dead, and was also made at the time of the environmental pollution awareness when other films about exposure to toxic chemicals were coming out. The actors were a great choice, the plot was original and the music was pretty good. The punk-goth kids consist of a strange misfit group:Trash, who looks like the bride of Pennywise the Clown Tina, a typical bimbo cheerleader who manages to stick around 'till the end Scuz, a tough kid clad in khaki clothes who seems to be the smartest of the group Chuck, a pervy geek Casey, a girl with rainbow streaks in her hair who despises Chuck Suicide, the leader of the group Spider, a Gothic/emo punkFor a low-budget film it was surprisingly entertaining, and had some funny scenes like the one where a zombie police officer looking for ""food"" calls up the local hospital and asks for more paramedics to be sent.

57,mentalcritic,Meh...,5,11 February 2005,"After reading that this remake/spoof was written by John Russo with being a sequel to Night Of The Living Dead in mind, I cannot say I am entirely surprised at its mediocrity. Director Dan O'Bannon had enough sense to decide he didn't want to end up with unfavourable comparisons to George Romero's timeless classic. So he rewrote this script idea as a sort of satire. Which is rather novel when you consider that the zombie horror concept is, at heart, a satire of consumerist social ideas. What makes this satire work is how irreverently it plays out. What counts against it is that it never seems to make up its mind whether it wants the audience to laugh or scream.Another moment in the film's favour is when one of the young punk women, played with aplomb by Linnea Quigley, strips down to her birthday suit and dances about. Not only is she very pleasant to look at this way, she remains in this state throughout the rest of the film. Even when she becomes a zombie. But that was one of the fun things about Hollywood in the mid-1980s. Women could get their clothes off without people making such a big drama about it. It would have been nice if more of the feminine part of the cast could have taken their clothes off, but this particular woman was pleasant enough to carry the show on her own.The rest of the cast do a decent job of playing the required parts, but there are no standout parts. Scratch that. The story and characters do have enough potential for memorable performances, but the actors seem utterly lost as to how to take advantage. Those who have watched enough B films will recognise a few familiar faces here and there, Thom Mathews and Miguel A. Núñez Jr. being two examples that spring to mind, but one will be hard-pressed to remember the characters' names. The real stars of this show, other than the aforementioned stripper, are the makeup effects.The majority of the zombies, in contrast to the more cerebral works of George Romero, really look like they're dead. Unfortunately, they also seem to follow that fast-zombie pattern. In fact, this could well be where the origin of the fast-zombie idea may be traced back to. The ending seems more like a cop-out than a wrap-up. Given how the rest of the film makes the zombies seem invulnerable, I suppose this was inevitable, but it also has that faint odour of poor planning. When all is said and done, John Russo appears to have been doing some serious coattail riding with his connection to Night Of The Living Dead.I gave Return Of The Living Dead a five out of ten. It is amusing enough to pass ninety minutes with, but I wouldn't want to take it with me to a desert island. It is worth a rental.",The Return of the Living Dead

The chemical gas which resurrects the dead is stored in an army surplus store and two employees accidentally spill it out into the air. Oh, and there's a cemetery nearby.Wickedly funny zombie movie that makes fun of Romero's classic but completely stands on it's own. One of the things that's altered is that the zombies actually crave for brains and not the flesh. The violence is extreme and definitely not for kids but the overall tone is humorous.

59,vip_ebriega,Punk-rock 'Night of the Living Dead'.,7,9 February 2007,"My Take: An often disgusting, mostly hilarious zombie parody which works just as well as a horror movie. This horror flick is a really entertaining spoof. It was obviously parodying George A. Romero's horror classic ""The Night of the Living Dead"", the film even proclaims that NOTLD was based on true events. The film is also has a rock music score.Grossly entertaining and darkly hilarious, it's like both a spoof and a punk-rock version of Romero's classic ""dead"" movies. Still effective (both in laughs and scares) even today. Little-known stars James Karen and Thom Matthews steal the show as two medical supply warehouse attendants.

60,fmarkland32,The movie has brains..and lots of it!,10,7 November 2006,"May Contain Spoilers James Karen and Bloodmatch's Thom Mathews work in a warehouse that receives all sorts of bodies used for scientific research and it's here that Karen explains to Mathews, that Night Of The Living Dead was actually a true story and that the government covered it up, due to the fact that they invested a gas that reanimates the dead. Karen also explains that he has a cannister of said gas and well suffice to say the gas is unleashed and it brings back the dead in a night where no brain is safe. Return Of The Living Dead is a great movie not because of it's sense of humor (which always helps) but because it is at times tragic. The way James Karen cremates himself after seeing what happens to Mathews is more sad than gruesome. Although that's not to say the movie is depressing, the movie is a full of black comedy and grisly good cheer. For instance there is no funnier moment in black comedy history then when the zombie answers a request by he hospital asking if they need more paramedics. ""Yeah send more paramedics!"" and it becomes a balancing act of humor, scares and sad moments. The ending in particular is a real downer and although it ends the only plausible way it could, the movie never chickens out and goes of it's way to prove itself as a classic. A classic in it's own right. But a classic nonetheless.**** out of 4-(Excellent, A Must See!)",The Return of the Living Dead
61,one9eighty,Send... more... paramedics.,9,6 October 2020,"This 1985 B-Movie comedy horror film was born from of a split between George A Romero and John Russo after the 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead"" film (read more about that later). Described as a ""mordant punk comedy"", this zombie film broke a lot of the established rules created in other zombie films. The first time I watched it I was in shock and awe at what I was watching, after re-watched it numerous times I realized that I had fallen in love with it.Brief Summary:
A warehouse accident leaves a small group of people dealing with the consequences of a zombie outbreak.Detailed Summary:
At an unassuming warehouse, a foreman is trying to impress new employees by showing them military drums that have accidentality wound up there. Unfortunately, he releases a toxic gas which reanimates the dead, starting with a body that is in the meat locker. In an attempt to cover up the mishap they take things into their own hand, but it would seem that every part of the zombie can work independently. Further trying to fix the issue they persuade the local (maybe) ex-Nazi mortician to burn the cadaver, but this only makes things worse as a toxic cloud of zombie moisture is released into the atmosphere - queue toxic zombie making rain falling on the local cemetery. A group of local punk kids happen to be in the cemetery at the time, so they are immediately mixed up in the chaos. With no hope in sight, and no relief offered by the local emergency services or the military, there seems to be only one solution - but will it come to using nuclear weapons?Film Stuff:
When George A Romero and John Russo parted ways after ""Night of the Living Dead"" 1968, John Russo retained the rights to any future film where the titles mentioned ""Living Dead"". Romero went the route of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"", meanwhile Russo went full steam ahead doing ""Living Dead"" movies such as this. Written by Rudy Ricci (who was a zombie in some of the Romero zombie films), Russel Reiner (who was Johnny at the start of ""Night of the Living Dead""), and John Russo (co-writer on ""Night of the Living Dead""). The screenplay was done by Dan O'Bannon (writer on ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"").Tobe Hooper (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""Poltergeist""), was initially brought in to direct, but he took a sideways step into the driving seat for ""Lifeforce"" which was scripted by the same name who is credited for screenwriting here, Dan O'Bannon. When Hooper stepped away O'Bannon was offered the chance to direct this, which he did, under the condition that he could rewrite the script significantly. It took him four months to do that, and as part of the rewrite he wanted to bring in a lot of dark and morbid humour.The film cost $4 million to make and went on to gross $14.2 million worldwide. It had a runtime of 92 minutes and was released by Orion Pictures. Cinematography was by Jules Brenner and Robert Gordon stepped into the editing seat. The musical score was led by Matt Clifford and Francis Haines and also featured lots of legendary punk rock and death metal bands from Los Angeles who were tearing up the scene at the time, including The Cramps, The Flesh Eaters, The Damned, and SSQ.Cast:
The cast in the film was a mishmash of people, some faces from TV, some from film, and some people with a little experience of Broadway too. Unless you really know film though, you aren't going to be able to recognise many of the names. One thing I can say though, is that they are perfect for this film.Leading the cast, Clu Gulager played Burt, James Karen played Frank and Don Calfa played Ernie. All having fun roles that helped drive the comedy in the film forward. They are occasionally serious but more often than not they are bumbling through the film as idiot 'any man' characters. I enjoyed them all thoroughly.Wrap up:
This is one of the rare films that manages to do over-the-top horror and gore with black humour mixed in. It takes what was a tried and tested zombie film formula and refreshes it for a younger fast-food audience. This film features brain-eating zombies instead of just the undead who want to eat any part of living flesh. In this, zombies have more pace and ferocity - it wasn't ""28 Days Later"" that had the first running zombies - they are here!The undead can talk (""Send more paramedics"", ""Send more cops"", & ""braains"") and have independent thought to motivate their actions. In addition, when these zombies are torn apart, their limbs are just as active as zombie heads. Importantly too, you cannot just shoot the zombie in the head to kill it - in this it takes a lot lot more.This film has a fast and frantic pace and never lets up with it action of gore, no long and boring explanations here, and better yet, the good guys don't win. It's high camp in true 80's style and almost drips with neon poison thanks to some lovely cinematography and effects.This is an unappreciated and forgotten classic. People that dismiss this as a poor rip-off of Romero's films have missed out in a big way. They are also likely to argue that Romero's films were the standard, but when this went head to head with Romero's second film, this actually came out better at the box office. It wouldn't be fair to say this is better because both are epic, but this film was made for different audience, the forgotten misfits, the coke-cola, fast-food generation that liked things fast, hard, and messy. To make things more interesting, this is a spoof film, before spoof films were really a thing.
If you are a fan of zombies, violence, gore, horror, dark humour, punk rock, and fun times, then I really implore you to give this a try... Unless you are on the younger side of course - this film is definitely not for the younger audiences. At its release this ran into numerous problems getting a release and was even considered a ""video nasty"" for a while. Nowadays it is available to buy on DVD (or whatever modern format you want) with an 18-rating.This film holds a place in my heart, it filled my eyes with joy and my brain with a fascination for blood curdling funny films. Sharing the same genre as films like ""Re-Animator"", ""Evil Dead 2"", and ""Braindead"", all I can say is - Get on it!",The Return of the Living Dead
62,phubbs,The Return of the Living Dead,7,12 February 2015,"The first and probably the best of the 'Return' horror comedies depending on your opinion of course (although the second is pretty good). I think most would agree the special effects and makeup do look the best and the most stickiest in this first one. Plenty of murky atmosphere with misty dank graveyards, being trapped in a single building, the small town being slowly overrun and taken over plus a great twist ending with no survivors which is quite unique.This film unleashes the now classic notion of toxic gas or waste kick starting a zombie outbreak. The all too cheesy notion of some dumb punks messing with some dangerous looking canisters/drums that leak a weird gas/ooze that somehow awakens/reanimates the dead. This is also the film that gave birth to the classic notion of zombies lurching around hankering for brains to munch on, maybe even letting out the odd 'brains!' line. So yes this film is the original hokey zombie popcorn flick that inspired an entire modern pop culture.The main course of this silly film is the terrific makeup and puppetry on display throughout the film. The zombies are on top form as they stagger around with limbs and faces flopping off left right and centre. All are really played well by a large cast of extras who really put a lot of effect into their performances. If you think of 'Thriller' (1983) then you have a good sense of this film basically. Its an extended adult version of 'Thriller' but not quite as good in the makeup and effects department believe it or not. But its clear where the idea came from as a lot of the undead awakening sequences and overall visuals look very similar, a bit of a rip off really.Still this has some great chuckle moments mainly from Karen and Mathews with their little double acts, whilst Calfa actually brings a sense of realism and believable acting to the fold with his performance. His final scene at the very end is actually quite poignant. Definitely one of the best horror comedies of the 80's with a surprising bonus of good acting to boot.7/10",The Return of the Living Dead

64,DarthBill,"""You mean the movie lied?!""",7,26 July 2006,"Plot in a nutshell - Local hunky guy Freddy (Thom Matthews) is at work where his supervisor Frank (James Karan) shows him a dead body and a bunch of misplaced army tanks, which Frank claims were connected to the real life story that inspired George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"". When Frank bangs on one of the tanks to show its durability, he pops the thing open and a bunch of gas shoots out, overpowering both workers and resurrecting the dead body in their freezer area. Elsewhere, an army man is still on the hunt for those missing tanks. When Frank & Freddy wake up, they find the dead body's been resurrected and is on the loose, so they call their boss, Burt (Clu Galager), who shows up and with his nitwit workers tries to mutilate the yellow corpse thing, but it won't die. So they take the mutilated pieces to Ernie, the guy at the crematorium, and they try to resolve things by burning the monster, but in doing so they shoot the deadly gas upside into the sky, where it infects the clouds and creates an acid rain that spreads the vile stuff to the cemetery where a bunch of young people, among them Freddy's beautiful virgin girlfriend Tina (Beverly Randolph) are hanging out. The result - zombie resurrection and rampage! Even worse, Frank & Freddy are turning into zombies from breathing the gas! And there's nothing the cops can do!

65,jluis1984,Outstanding mix of comedy and horror,8,29 June 2006,"Dan O'Bannon, is probably more known for his work as a writer (he is the creator of ""Alien""), but in 1985 he left his mark in the horror genre when he directed a small low-budget film that mixed horror and comedy in a satire that payed homage to George A. Romero's ""zombie"" movies. ""The Return of the Living Dead"" is a terrific comedy-horror film that perfectly balances the two genres and probably has been the most influential film of its kind since its release.The story begins with Freddy (Thom Mathews), a young man on the first day of his first job as an assistant in a warehouse. His uncle Frank (James Karen) is his new boss, and he shows Freddy the warehouse's most bizarre item: a forgotten tank of a Government's special gas that can bring the dead back to life as zombies. By an accident, the tank is opened and the beginning of zombie mayhem occurs.""The Return of the Living Dead"" is a perfectly well-written film that never loses steam and remains true to its original premise. O'Bannon makes good use of both genres and keeps an equilibrium where neither the horror nor the comedy are sacrificed for the benefit of the other. The film is also very smart and witty and doesn't rely on cheap tired jokes to be funny. Loosely based on John Russo's book, Dan O'Bannon takes the story to a new level with the added comedy and the political satire and keeps true to the zombie sub-genre.Overall the film has good rhythm, and it has fitting direction. O'Bannon always has been more a writer than a director (so far he has only directed two films), but his work here is really good for a debut. The film has a slick, ""rebel"" look that goes hand to hand with the punk characters that are main part of the film. Despite its low-budget, the film has terrific special effects and particularly the make-up, still looks better than most of the modern stuff of more recent films.The cast is superb, and it is one of the highlights of the film. Veterans Clu Gulager, James Karen and Don Calfa make wonders with their characters and demonstrate their experience. Newcomers Thom Mathews, Miguel A. Nuñez and Linnea Quigley shine in their roles as well as the rest of the punk gang, all very effective in their roles. Quigley has an unforgettable scene that launched her career and reinvented the term Scream Queen.The movie suffers from its low-budget, but it is never a noticeable problem (in fact, it adds to the entertainment). O'Bannon may not be a great director, but his proficient script and the great cast definitely make up for any mistake he may had committed. If a real flaw is to be found, it would be the fact that it has dated somewhat badly, although it has gained that nostalgic mystique that surrounds all those 80s horror classics.To summarize, while ""The Return of the Living Dead"" is not a perfect comedy/horror, it is definitely the most influential of all, and still holds up as one of the best horror movies of all time. To the world, Dan O'Bannon may be the creator of ""Alien"", but to horror fans, he is the creator of ""The Return of the Living Dead"". 8/10",The Return of the Living Dead
66,aesgaard41,This Movie Needs More Brains,8,31 March 2001,"SOME SENTENCES MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS:  This movie wants you to believe that it is a sequel to the George Romero Cult Classic by having references to it, but there are so many differences that it just isn't possible. One, the zombies have gone from cannibals to brain eaters, and two, the logic is out the window. The brain is covered by the skull, and I don't see a single pair of nut-crackers laying around the cemetery. One bite is not going to do it, and besides, these bodies have to be in a state of decomposition the older that they are that they should be rattling apart with all the exercise they're doing. One of the creatures is called a ""tarman,"" where did that word come from and how would a street punk know it ? ( Tarmans I've later read are corpses recovered from English bogs; they wouldn't be found in an American cemetery.)And how are the dead getting out of the caskets with at least a ton of topsoil and maybe even the tombstone on top ? Even if they were digging out, they wouldn't have made it out until the next night. A undead Civil War Soldier somehow figures out how to use a C.B. Radio. The hard rock soundtrack also stinks; a funeral dirge would have been more appropriate, but this was made solely for horror fans and less for movie goers. There is a lot of wit and creativity rampant to make the movie enjoyable. The cemetery is named Resurrection Cemetery as a joke, but the real Resurrection Cemetery is in Justice,Illinois and it is haunted by a famous ghost called Resurrection Mary. There is an excellent cast with Don Calfa, Thom Matthews, Linnea Quigley (later of Night of the Demons), veteran actor James Karen and enjoyable Clu Gulager as the inept warehouse manager with the dumb ideas. Quigley does a dance naked on an above ground tomb in a sequence that makes this movie a cult classic and she stays naked as she herself becomes a zombie (another crony is so eaten away at he can't come back). Her appearance as one of the undead is very well done and excellently chilling.Largely edited on TV, this movie is best viewed on video.",The Return of the Living Dead

We meet two employees in a medical supply warehouse.Then we are told, that the original 'Night of The Living Dead' was based on a true event. There was this chemical created by the army. One thing leads to another and we learn, that this chemical is stored in the basement of the warehouse. Guess what happens after that? The acting and dialog is mostly pretty wooden though I have a feeling it was meant to be that way. The makeup effects are pretty good and some of the zombies are actually pretty gruesome. The direction is actually rather good considering, that O'Bannion hasn't directed that much. A slight minus comes from the terrible use of synthesized music.

73,acedj,Brains!!!!,9,19 March 2020,"This movie was titled as it was to cause fans of Night Of The living Dead to believe this was a sequel. It was not. What it was, was a comedic take on the zombie genre.Frank and Freddy are a couple of idiots working at a medical supply company. It's Freddy's first day at work, and Frank tries to impress him with a tale of reanimated corpses, and how the army accidentally sent a few to the shop. To prove it Frank takes Freddy to the basement to see one and accidentally cracks the seal, causing the chemical that made the original zombies to be released. This brings about another mob of zombies. Unlike more traditional zombies, these talk.This movie is a great, funny and fun look at zombies. The special effects are actually quite good given the time it was made.",The Return of the Living Dead
74,Rautus,One of the best Zombie comedies,10,4 June 2007,"If you love gory films and comedies then you will Return of The Living Dead, the film makes an funny plot that Night of The Living Dead was based on a true story and George A. Romero was told to change it from what really happened. The real thing is some barrels containing a gas that Re-Animates the Dead, of course the two working at the place accidentally open the container releasing the gas so when they call the boss Bert about what happened he shows up to find that a corpse that they have on ice is alive and trying to get out. Using the idea from the films that destroying the brains kill them they let it out and pick axe it in the head but it's still alive. They then decapitate it but it still moves so they cut it up and go to a friend of Bert's, they then burn the body and while thinking it's over the ashes from the body pour from the chimney causing it to rain, suddenly the Dead awaken and cause chaos. This film is full of humour and gore to make this a classic. I also recommend you see Shaun of the Dead which is another great Zombie comedy. 10/10",The Return of the Living Dead

I have seen Romero's ""of the Dead"" series and I loved all of them. Then I heard of Return of the Living Dead and thought ""Uhoh...a knock off"" and put off attempting to find it. One night, I was bored out of my mind. SO I went to the library and looked in the DVD section...I then remembered my DVD player was broken so I went to the VHS section. I saw Return of the Living dead there...it basically yelled for me to watch it. I took it home, popped it in expecting to be bored out of my mind....boy was I ever wrong! This movie was great! The characters were good and always funny, the zombies were goofy but in a good way. Some of my favorite characters were: Suicide: the angry 'punk rock' guy with piercings and chains all over, I don't know why but he was fun to watch, Im only sad that he was the first to go...... Trash: The emo girl who was overly obsessed by death..... Scuz: The punk rock looking guy with a mohawk and trench-coat, however, he just wasn't in the movie enough. Only always off to the side.... Spider: he was always trying to take control, and had some funny angry lines.... Frank: The manager at Uneeda Medical Supply, who was way too into his job and all that, and when he becomes infected he turns into a whiny coward, but its funny... Freddy: Part of the gang of punk rockers and also the newest worker at Uneeda who pretty much hangs around with Frank the whole movie.... Tarman: probably the main zombie, he comes from the 245 Trioxin barrel, probably the smartest zombie. Well, I'm done ranting FINALLY. If your looking for a good horror/comedy, this is the one for you. I'm only glad that a bunch of random events led to me watching this (Note: The movie didn't come out on DVD until Sept 2007, about 5 months after I saw ROLD).",The Return of the Living Dead
76,Gafke,Rabid Weasels?,10,2 November 2003,"This is one of those very rare films that combines good black humor with bloody, messy gore and does it perfectly.  Where `Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' fails miserably, `Return of the Living Dead' succeeds triumphantly.  It takes a tired plot (zombies eat teenagers) and makes it new again.  The teenagers here are not faceless, stupid, oversexed victims at all.  They are misfits and outsiders, the kind of kids who probably go to horror movies every day and make fun of the faceless, stupid, oversexed victims who populated the majority of the slasher films made in the 1980s. The nihilistic punk rock teens can identify with the zombies, and even though it is their ultimate fate to be consumed by them, you like them, you want them to survive and you're sorry to see them go even though the zombies are every bit as cool.Long before `28 Days Later' appeared, `Return of the Living Dead'  presented us with FAST zombies, zombies who could run, jump and work together like a football team, tackling people and making it a group effort to tear their victims apart.  There are very few slow, shuffling monsters here; these are zombies to contend with.  They talk, they think, they problem solve.  Who could ever forget the Tar Man (my personal favorite) rigging up a device to tear down the metal closet doors, behind which our heroine has locked herself?  The adult characters in this film are no less interesting than the teenagers.  James Karen is absolutely hysterical in his role as a medical warehouse manager, whose bumbling irresponsibility leads to the zombies being unleashed.  Clu Gulager is a stressed out corporate jerk who will do anything to save the name and reputation of the warehouse he owns.  And Don Calfa is excellent as the slightly shady mortician who may or may not be an ex-Nazi.  The mismatched cast really comes together and forms a bond here, fighting back and growing more desperate as the zombies grow stronger.  This film never lets up, not for one minute.  There are no long explanation scenes, no boring set-up, just in-your-face excitement from the very first scene.  It is the perfect homage to the Romero films; there is no happy ending here, only an ironic twist which will make even the most cynical doomsayer grin.  This film is already a cult classic and deserves its status.  It's as close to flawless as you can get.",The Return of the Living Dead

Tobe Hooper was originally set to direct, but when he dropped out of the project Dan O'Bannon was drafted in and set about a radical rewrite to differentiate it from Romero's movies. The end result is a classic of the zombie genre that delivers a good laugh with its silly, over-the-top nature. A mysterious military chemical is accidentally released into the atmosphere by a couple of numbskull employees at a medical supplies warehouse. Pretty soon the dead are coming back to life with a craving for human brains, leaving warehouse manager Clu Gulager to battle it out for survival alongside a mysterious mortician (Don Calfa) and a gang of partying punks . The movie is notable for featuring Linnea Quigley stripping off in a cemetery and dancing naked on top of the graves, as well as its soundtrack which features songs by The Cramps, The Damned and Roky Erickson amongst others.

This splits the difference between the wit and the gore while basically dispensing with terror altogether: there's too much distanced goofiness to feel much. Instead, it's a punk-rock zombie party, and as such it rocks the house, with hilarious dialogue from humans and zombies alike and social commentary limited to general contempt for bosses, cops and nuclear weapons. The screaming and general chaos do get a bit static toward the finish line, but by then a great deal of good will has been generated with the multifarious sight gags. Naming them seems redundant, because they're so iconic - the half-dog, the headless yellow zombie, the 'rabid weasels', the re-animated butterfly board.

To me it wasn't scary at all, yes a little creepy; but more humorous than anything. I loved Tarman and the zombies wanting more paramedics and cops- yum. I love George Romero classics, especially Day Of The Dead. This is more of a parody to his work. I thought one of the scenes with the punks could have been cut.

82,jcbutthead86,One Of The Best Horror/Zombie Films Ever Made. A Classic Horror Comedy.,10,24 February 2013,"The Return Of The Living Dead is one of the best Horror and Zombie films ever made,a brilliant Horror film that mixes Horror,Comedy,Zombies and great special effects and soundtrack. All those combinations make The Return Of The Living Dead not only one of my favorite Horror and Zombie films,but one of my favorite films of all time and one of the great Horror Classics of the 1980s and of all time.Based on the novel of the same name by John Russo and set in Louisville,Kentucky,The Return Of The Living Dead tells the story of a young man named Freddy(Thom Matthews)who has just started his first day working at Uneeda Medical Supply Warehouse,working for his bosses Burt(Clu Gulager)and Frank(James Karen). While showing Freddy the ropes Frank tells Freddy that the Warehouse has Army tanks that contain zombies down in the basement. When Freddy and Frank look at the tanks,the two accidentally release a toxic gas that raises the dead from the grave. Meanwhile,Freddy's friends are waiting for Freddy and looking to party,but unfortunately Freddy,Frank,Burt and Freddy's friends have to deal with dead zombies want human brains and also want to party.One of the many reasons that The Return Of The Living Dead is Horror classic is because the film reinvented the zombie genre. Instead of making another zombie film where the zombies are walking slowly and dumb,the zombies in this film are smart,fast and talk. The zombies can get you anywhere and anytime in the film are the characters are not safe,you can run and run,but the zombies still catch up to you in heavy numbers. ROTLD also gives the zombies a different target for their eating,not flesh,but human brains. In someways ROTLD reverses the idea of killing zombies by hitting the brain instead this time the zombies are eating and killing humans by eating their brains and the zombies are just addicted to it. While many say 28 Days Later(which is a great movie as well)started the idea of fast Zombies,ROTLD did first and in ROTLD and deserves credit. ROTLD also succeeds as a great Horror-Comedy,because mixing the two great genres is never easy. I think the reason the Horror and Comedy works so well in ROTLD is because of the bizarre and over the top situations and the way the characters act and react to the things going on in the film whether it's dealing with the zombies or with each other and the situations are handled with Black Comedy and gore. The dialog and interactions between the characters add to the Comedy in the film and while it feels real,it's also over the top and insane. The Comedy works because the actors play the scenes straight forward and sometimes serious so that the film doesn't become a Spoof or Parody. While the film is a Black Comedy,the movie never forgets it's a Horror film and the film is very scary and filled with creepy atmosphere and keeps you on the edge of your seat with dread and well-placed scares,because like I said in this film no character in the film is safe. The characters in the film are likable and well-developed and when things go bad you definitely feel sorry for them and their reactions while at times over the top feel real and not forced or fake. The teenage characters and adult characters aren't Slasher film victims where you are waiting and hoping the characters to get killed off,but sympathetic enough to root for and are hoping for their survival. The violence and gore in the film are well-done and suit the film and while this film isn't as bloody or gory as other great zombie films like the Night Of The Living Dead,(which the characters make reference to)Dawn Of The Dead,Day Of The Dead or Re-Animator,(both of the latter films came out the same year in 1985)the film can be pretty bloody and gory at times. The ending of the film is great because it's unexpected,funny and adds to the film's greatness because it's tragic,bleak and darkly humorous and it's one of the reasons ROTLD is a classic.The cast does a great job in their roles. Clu Gulager is great as Burt,a man who takes charge and kicks zombie butt. Don Calfa is wonderful as Ernie,an embalmer who tries to help out Burt. James Karen and Thom Matthews are hilarious as Frank and Freddy and have great chemistry together. Miguel Nunez Jr. is great as Spider who's smart,tough and can handle himself. Linnea Quigley is wonderful and sexy as Trash,a girl who loves sex and death. Quigley's nude scene or scenes is one of the film's highlights. This film is one of the reasons Quigley became a scream queen and B-movie queen. Beverly Randolph does a fine job as Tina,Freddy's scared girlfriend. John Philbin and Jewel Shepard are wonderful as Chuck and Casey. Mark Venturini is funny as Suicide an angry punk. Brian Peck(Scuz),Jonathan Terry(Colonel Glover)and Cathleen Cordell(Colonel's wife)give good performances as well.The direction by Writer-Director Dan O'Bannon is excellent with O'Bannon using great angles,close-ups and bringing a great pace and energy to the film and does well in the scary scenes. Great direction,O'Bannon.The score by Matt Clifford is effective and creepy and matches the tone of the film. A well-done and memorable score. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack like The Trioxin Theme(Frances Haines),Nothing For You(T.S.O.L.),Dead Beat Dance(The Damned),Surfin'Dead(The Cramps),Tonight(We'll Make Love Until We Die)(SSQ),Partytime(45 Grave),Take A Walk(Tall Boys),Burn The Flames(Rory Erickson),Eyes Without A Face(The Flesh Eaters)and Love Under Will(The Jet Jack Berries). An awesome soundtrack that mixes Punk and Pop.The special make-up effects in the film are well-done and realistic and hold up really well.In final word,if you love Horror films,Comedies or Zombie films,I highly suggest you see The Return Of The Living Dead a true Horror classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Return of the Living Dead
83,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"""I hit the f@*%--- brain!""",9,1 August 2021,"Dan O'Bannon's contribution to film was quite a resume. He wrote ""Alien"", which became one of the most famous films ever made, not only one of the greatest in the horror and Sci-Fi genre, and he also contributed a valuable part to George Lucas and ""Star Wars"" by working on the special effects through his computer animation work. He worked with John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper. He also directed this absolute gem in 1985; a hilarious, tongue-in-cheek satire of the George A. Romero's zombie films, namely ""Night of the Living Dead"".The characters are very memorable thanks to the performances. Clu Gulager, James Karen and Don Calfa are superb. They absolutely steal the show. Gulager is no natural as the atypical small-town business man, whose biggest fear during an outbreak of the living dead is how this will look for his business, and his deadpan wheeling and dealing is a joy to watch - ""Be a man, Frank!""James Karen as Frank draws us in at the beginning as he shows a young, slightly dim-witted man named Freddie around the warehouse after closing-time, giving him a quick feel for how the place works. In the excellent and hilarious opening, the pair unwittingly unleash a gas that brings the dead in the graveyard next door to life, which spells danger for a group of punks who are hanging around there waiting for Freddie to knock off work.Don Calfa as the mortician is also superb and it is an absolute joy watching them all board themselves up in the mortuary, scream and shout and run around fighting the hordes of the undead. O'Bannon allows a certain natural element take hold of proceedings, as the actors are allowed to run riot and it pays off.The parody is spot-on. Staple horror tropes are utilised, from going down into the dark forbidden basement in the opening scenes, to attacking the brain of the undead to stop them. So what happens when that fails? ""The Return of the Living Dead"" had me laughing hard all through, and I also really enjoyed the cosy, horror atmosphere generated by the cheesy special effects and dark lightning. It has Halloween favourite written all over it.",The Return of the Living Dead
84,squirrel_burst,"Must-see zombie movie, one of my favorites.",9,16 November 2014,"""The Return of the Living Dead"" is a rare film: It's a horror comedy that actually works, with equal parts scary and funny. If you associate comedy with goofy-looking zombies and you're wary, don't be scared. One of my favourite thing about this movie is the variety of zombies. There are some terrific special effects at work here and they show off a multitude of reanimated corpses. We've got everything from rotting bodies that are all slimy and gooey, to skeleton with just enough muscle left on them to shamble around, to dismembered bodies and even animals brought back from the dead. These effects really stand the test of time and you won't believe this movie was made in 1985. To counteract the threats, we've got some likable human protagonists. In this case you cheer for them because they're in way over their heads. In some cases you know these guys don't have a chance because they're not very bright, but there are some smart people in this movie too that come up with decent strategies to combat the plague of zombies. That's all good, but for me, what really makes a movie not only good, but great are memorable scenes and quotable lines. There is no shortage of them here (my favourite line probably being a goth guy talking about his attire. ""You think this is a fashion statement? This is a way of LIFE!"") As far as horror movies go, this one is incredibly influential because there are many horror (And particularly zombie) tropes that come straight out of this movie. You'll be watching the film and go ""Oh! That's where that came from!"" Just because this has inspired countless other films doesn't mean you'll find the typical clichés in here though, there is a lot of originality in this movie. It's one of those influential horror movies that's has countless homages and has inspired many others and you'll have a great time watching it, though if you're squeamish, it's quite gory so prepare yourself.

85,geminiredblue,"Ahem, more brains please!",8,18 April 2011,"Sadly, during the mid-80s, audiences lost interest in zombie movies. That's partly why I think Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD did so poorly at the box office. Sure Michael Jackson's THRILLER music video had come out a few years earlier (with some notably wonderful make-up, I might add), but by 1985, this little gem went virtually unnoticed in theaters. Happily, the home video market began to flourish and I think that's what helped RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD (or ROTLD for short) become the cult classic that it is today. The movie has us believe that everything that George Romero wrote in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was based on a true story. Then, the writers wisely take our concepts of slow-moving, mostly-stupid zombies and turns it on its head. Pre-dating Danny Boyle's wonderful 28 DAYS LATER by 15 years, this movie introduced audiences to the concept of faster, smarter zombies who can even talk. A host of veteran character actors bring to us a chilling tale of a government-made chemical getting loose and wreaking terror on a nearby cemetery. The punk rock music and its host of young punks gives this movie a grunge feel, while the zombie effects are astounding. Who doesn't find the appearance of Tarman absolutely terrifying? What ROTLD has going for it is an even mix of laughs and screams. Yes, it's that rarest of horror films known as the zombie comedy (or zomedy, for short.) Ultimately, ROTLD doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should the audience!",The Return of the Living Dead
86,TheRedDeath30,Braaaaiiiinnnsss,10,18 January 2015,"There is really, honestly no way for me to give an accurate assessment of this movie. Sometimes, you are just so in love with something that you are far past seeing any of its' faults any longer and only concentrate on what you love about it. When you have crossed the line from objective critic to outright fanboy, your opinion should be taken with a grain of salt, so I'm just throwing out that caveat right now.This move was my first experience with the zombie genre and probably one of the first movies that really terrified me. Like a lot of us, if I wanted to see things that my parents would have considered to be too mature for me, I went to obvious outlet -- my grandparents. It's 1985. I'm 10 years old. My grandparents have HBO and pretty much let me stay up as late as I want to watch what I want. Queue up a Saturday at 2 AM and my first viewing of this classic movie. I only barely knew what zombies were and that knowledge had come from Scooby Doo and old comic books. I certainly didn't understand why they wanted brains so badly, but I was terrified that they were coming to get my brains. This created the zombie template, in my head. It would be a number of years before I ever saw a Romero zombie flick and remember being disappointed that they didn't moan ""braiiins"" the whole time. ROTLD was my first experience and, to me, all zombies were brain eaters.What I clearly missed out on, as a 10-year old, was the bizarre sense of humor in this movie. It's not even just a comedic interlude or two, the movie goes for humor the entire way through, creating a much different feel than the Romero and Fulci zombie moves that had come before it. I think it's that angle that has helped this movie to create its' own niche in zombie lore. While so many zombie flicks come and go and are soon forgotten, this movie was able to stand the test of time and even spawn numerous sequels. Yes, the effects are great, but many zombie movies can claim the same. It was that odd black humor that set this movie apart.I see that now, but didn't all those years ago, which brings me to the most important part of the movie. It may be strange and humorous, but it's also pretty terrifying. The setting of a dark and stormy night with the three central stages of a medical supply warehouse, a cemetery and a mortuary help to create a bleak feel throughout. The zombies are not just simply rotting shamblers, either, but have a real menace about them.As I started the review stating, I know that there are many 80s kids like myself that probably view this movie much higher than others do because of its' place in our hearts, but that's okay and I'm not going to apologize for that. This movie helped to solidify my love of the horror genre and will always be one of my favorites.",The Return of the Living Dead
87,happyendingrocks,"It's not often you see ""must-see"" and ""horror-comedy"" in the same review, so that should definitely count for something",8,27 April 2011,"Dan O'Bannon's rollicking send-up of the genre he helped create is a rare horror-comedy that succeeds on both fronts. With a generous dispersement of splatter and some truly priceless sight gags, Return Of The Living Dead distinguishes itself as a must-see entry in the zombie canon and delivers a mirthful dose of gross, outrageous fun in the process.The excellent cast, which features a perpetually nude Linnea Quigley and Friday The 13th franchise alumni Thom Mathews and Miguel Nunez, is obviously having a great time with the material, and their infectious enthusiasm makes the film impossible to resist. It would be easy for Return to slip into clichés with a band of punk-rock teens at the forefront, but the characters largely eschew stereotypes and emerge as a likable group of protagonists who play out even the most blatantly comical elements with a straight face.Though not an ""official"" sequel to Night Of The Living Dead, the film (rather audaciously, actually) explains away the cause of the zombie outbreak in George Romero's 1968 classic, openly referring to it by name and shattering the fourth wall by telling us it was only a movie. However, according to ROTLD, the scenario in Night was based on real events, and when enthused listener Mathews excitedly consents to see proof of this, the trigger for this deliciously droll zombie uprising is set into motion.It's interesting to note that Romero's Day Of The Dead was released the same year as this ersatz entry in the series, if only because the tones of the two films are as diametrically opposed as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Sophie's Choice. Return may not yield the intellectual rewards that Day aspires to, but it does infuse a healthy dose of levity that is completely absent from Romero's stark and misanthropic (but brilliant, don't get me wrong) entry.Clearly, the FX here can't compete with Tom Savini's indelibly amazing set-pieces in Day Of The Dead, but there are a few gore-drenched scenes in this film whose execution and facetious tone clearly forge part of the blueprint for Peter Jackson's early work. Even when we end up seeing patently unrealistic rubber puppets, the sometimes clunky effects actually serve the movie well, since they heighten the splat-stick sensibility that is the driving force in Return.Zombie purists may be a bit miffed that cardinal rules of the genre are broken, the most blatant deviation being that the ghouls in Return Of The Living Dead can talk. Yet, the classic ""send more paramedics"" line alone merits the acceptance of this alteration of the mythos, and since a good chunk of the humor is derived from the auditory skills of the prowling creatures, I will respectfully suggest that if this idea bothers you, you're more than welcome to skip this outing and watch Lucio Fulci's Zombie again instead.Certainly, the film is a tad lopsided and admittedly uses up its best stuff in the first half, but the humorously bleak and effective ending bookends the movie rather nicely. When the end result is a huge smile on your face while the credits roll, it doesn't seem useful to complain about how that smile got there.Return Of The Living Dead is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that earns every iota of its cult classic status. If you're a horror fan who also possesses a sense of humor, your life really isn't complete until you've seen this. Uneven, sure, but absolutely brilliant just the same.",The Return of the Living Dead
88,ryan-10075,"""Send more paramedics.""",9,23 April 2019,"Well, I'll say it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is to disco to what this amazing film is to punk music. Now, I am not nor was I ever a punk rocker, but man does this film ever bleed (no pun intended) this punk way of life.Just like a George A. Romero film we are thrown right into the fire or the story. In a Romero film it is to see if the characters can survive, here I think it is to see if you can survive.Freddy (Thom Matthews) has got himself a new job. It happens to be at the U-Need-A Medical Supply. Frank (wonderfully played by James Karen) is going to show him the ropes on his first night on the job. While doing the tour Freddy is shown some canisters that happen to have corpses inside them. It is here there is a wonderful tie in to George A. Romero's also excellent NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Accidentally one of the canisters is broken open and their boss Burt (wonderfully realistic performance by Clu Gulager) has to be called. In the end they visit Ernie the mortician (another fabulous performance, this time from Don Calfa) to see if he can help with their problem with the living dead. Meanwhile, some of Freddy's buddies including Miguel Nunez Jr., as Spider and B-Movie Scream Queen Linnea Quigley as Trash are nearby in the graveyard where the corpses seem to be coming back to life. I must say all of the members in the punk gang are memorable and you do remember them. They aren't just there to be just another victim. And with the 3 main actors in Gulager, Karen and Calfa; I am not sure how they could have been any better than they were in this film.Originally, there was a script written by John Russo, Rudy Ricci and Russell Streiner and it was called THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. All three of these men worked with Romero. Russo co-wrote NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, Streiner starred as brother Johnny in that as well and Ricci had written Romero's unsatisfying THERE'S ALWAYS VANILLA. Thing is Russo was given the ability to use the living dead in his titles, where Romero was not. Studio had the script, but did bring in writer Dan O'Bannon to rewrite it. Not sure how much beyond the title from the original script is in the film, but it seems through interviews I've seen with O'Bannon, it was he who turned this into a horror-comedy rather than just a straight horror. Tobe Hooper was to originally direct this film, but dropped out due to him directing LIFEFORCE (which funny enough was also co-written by Dan O'Bannon). O'Bannon then got asked to direct this film. I really love how this film is tied in with the original Romero zombie movie, but almost everything about these zombies is different. These zombies talk, they run and they also eat brains. This is the movie that can be tied to. But, when O'Bannon turned it into a comedy, he didn't make a parody of the Romero zombie films, he just turned things on their head. Which in zombie films of today that is common place, but in this film was groundbreaking on that front.I really would suggest watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD before watching this one. You are then given a wonderful knowledge of zombies. Everything will be shaken from that tree. O'Bannon uses humour as a tool in doing so, but of course also some delicious gore as well.Anyways, this film also has a quite nice pulsing theme and is loaded with some punk rock acts of that time on its soundtrack. I would really love to own that soundtrack, but unfortunately I do not.Enough of me gabbing about this movie, so go out and dig in!",The Return of the Living Dead
89,masercot,Nice Balance,8,21 October 2008,"This movie has a nice balance of nudity, gore, plot and retching. Upon my first viewing, I had to ask (my teenage son), ""Is there too much retching in this movie or exactly enough?"". We agreed that there was exactly enough. Most of it was done by the character Burt (Clu Gulager) who was exposed to the living dead chemical early on. In fact, there are more unsettling sounds in this movie than in your average Family Guy episode.Some people call this movie a comedy. It was probably meant as a comedy; however, the whole ""Braaaaaains!"" shtick has become a cultural icon. Outside of this superficial difference to the George Romero trilogy, the dead also talk...and explain themselves. Sometimes they even order brains as take-out food, as in one scene with the famous, ""Send more paramedics"".This movie has few shocks and no real suspense; however, it is very enjoyable, with some good performances by some veteran actors and some energetic performances by some younger actors.Warning: Due to a flesh-colored ""fig leaf"" used by Linnea Quigley during her nude dance, she WILL appear to have the genitals of a Barbie doll.8/10",The Return of the Living Dead

The movie is about 2 men who work at a morgue where they spill a fluid from the army out and they unleash a smell of deadly gas which causes the dead to become undead. The movie is funny and the zombies look good for the 80's and the daggyness of the movie makes it a must watch for all fans of this sought of stuff. I also think the sequels are worth a watch as they are all pretty good but they can still never surpass this beaut.

""Rabid weasels, Ernie."") The tone is manic, and this movie has a motor running: the pace is quick, the shock factor delivers (dismemberment, full frontal nudity, apocalyptic nihilism), and it's just really funny. Clu Gulager is so deft, such a pro, his timing so delicate, especially when negotiating with Don Calfa - their scene is a study in comic interplay; but Don Karen gets the juiciest monologue, and he performs at a level of sustained hilarity worthy of the Marx Brothers.The whole ensemble of genre-cliché characters plays its stereotypes straight, which prevents the movie from taking itself too seriously as a comedy.

92,Aussie Stud,"More like, ""Return Of The Living Jokes!""",1,1 March 2001,"After watching this garbage late at night on TNT, I wonder how movies like this ever garnered theatrical release in its day. Sure, I've seen my share of zombie flicks and I love 80's horror... but this movie takes the cake for 'Simply Awful Movies'!The movie seemed to hold all the right elements for the perfect 80's horror trash. Bad acting... bad hairstyles... bad clothes (the off-the-shoulder dress and the loose belt around the waist is a riot!) and the theme song which appeared to have been recorded directly off a synthesizer! But what I thought was a real scream was the hilarious 'so-called' ""special effects"". Did anyone see that zombie that escaped from that toxic drum that was covered in what appeared to be black sludge? Was that the creature from the black lagoon? Where was Adrienne Barbeau when this clunker came out?And don't get me wrong here. I've seen ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (which was a total classic), but why didn't that guy turn into a zombie after getting his skull bitten into by that 'half-skeleton' woman. And while I'm on that subject - how did she manage to get around if she was only half a skeleton? Let alone standing outside a window and gaining the ability to pull a human being outside long enough to take a big meaty chomp out of his head. I mean, I did see one of the dead police officers returning to life as a zombie. And how could she talk if she had no vocal chords? I guess I can accept the ""in-the-flesh"" zombie speaking into the CV radio scene... but what about her?Overall, the best part was when the nuke gets fired into the city. Too bad Jason Robards and Steve Guttenberg weren't in this movie. They could have taken advantage of the early 80's 'nuclear war' scare and turned this movie into something more controversial than a fully-forced laugh!

I don't get how anyone can be less creeped out by these super fast vicious zombies than the sluggishly slow (yet still effective) Romero zombies. I was on the edge of my seat when the hordes were sprinting after brains!I thought the whole Linnea Quigley dancing naked was a bit of an embarrassing moment in the film, as it is when she returns as a zombie in perfect condition despite having been attacked and killed by a large group of zombies.All in all it's clever, funny, intelligently written and performed, and a fun new spin on the zombie movie.",The Return of the Living Dead

98,bayardhiler,Gloriously 80's,10,5 July 2016,"Ever see a film that was so zany, so brilliant that you just couldn't contain yourself? That's the case with me concerning 1985's ""The Return of the Living Dead"". Directed by the late Dan O'Bannon (writer of ""Alien"") it's a zombie flick that manages to inject a vibrant, new energy into the zombie genre and has everything you could possibly want in an 80's horror/comedy/fantasy. It's funny, zany, horrific, scary, ridiculous, brilliant, even touching (you'll know which scene I mean) all at the same time. The plot begins when young, inexperienced Freddy (Thom Matthews) and elder company man Frank (James Karen) unwittingly release chemicals from a military marked container in the basement of a medical supply warehouse that have a habit of bringing back anything dead. Soon before you know it, a whole cemetery of corpses come back to life to terrify the living daylights out of everyone, especially Freddy's teenage friends who have taken to partying in that exact cemetery. What follows is one of the most fun zombie mashups in the history of filmmaking. Adding to the fun is the fact that the film is pure 80's, be it the fashion, music, characters, look and feel of the film. And it's especially the characters that really make the film, be it the young woman who thinks death is sexy (Linnea Quigley), the mortician who for some reason carries a gun with him at all times and listens to German marching music (Don Calfa) or the misfit guy who wears chains and leather and whom nobody understands (Mark Venturini). Plus, there's the zombies themselves, who, rather than being able to be killed by the shooting in the head device, are seemingly unkillable, have intelligence, and can even talk! The make up and effects still hold after all these years, a testament to the fact that CGI isn't everything. There were moments in the film that I just couldn't stop laughing because the comedic timing was so spot on. Everything you could want in a B-movie horror film and spoof is here, from the monsters themselves to an overzealous military officer who has contingency plans in place for such an event. No matter how old you are or tastes in film, this film is a must see. Don't miss it. Partytime!!!!!",The Return of the Living Dead
99,LanceBrave,An Undead League of Its Own,9,5 November 2013,"While watching ""Scream"" this summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about post-modern horror. Naturally, Kevin Williamson didn't do it first. Dan O'Bannon, a hugely successful and influential screenwriter that never got his due in his life time, beat him by a decade. Originally designed for horror-hack Tobe Hooper, O'Bannon injected the screenplay with his trademark inventiveness and quirky humor. ""Return of the Living Dead"" is textbook post-modern, referencing ""Night of the Living Dead"" explicitly. O'Bannon makes his intentions clear immediately with a sarcastic title card declaring the film to be a true story.Hardcore horror fans like myself hate on fast zombies while conveniently overlooking that this beloved cult classic has fast zombies in it. Unlike the inexplicable MTV zombies Zack Snyder inflicted on the world, ""Return's"" zombies have a reason for running. As Freddie and Frank's in-progress zombificaiton shows, Trioxin keeps the higher functions alive while causing the rest of the body to die, allowing for awesome, goopy zombies that run, talk, and use complex tools. The comic book tone prevents that from coming off as ridiculous, as it would in a more self-serious film. Zombies eating brains, a behavior this film popularized, is explained as curtailing the pain of rot. Of course, the brain contains dopamine and other tasty hormones. Makes perfect sense.The movie reinvented zombies in other ways. Romero always made an effort to give his ghouls personalities. Due to the microscopic budgets of his films, this usually didn't go beyond nurse outfits, clown wigs, or no clothes at all. ""Return,"" on the other hand, came right in the golden age of eighties creature effects. The Yellow Man bobs around with no head, a double amputee zombie waddles after his pray, and a skeletal corpse rattles a dangling spinal cord. The Tar Man stands in an undead league of his own. I seriously don't think there's a better example of what a zombie can be on-screen. Zombies are too frequently faceless hordes, an impulse this movie laughs at.Also unlike Romero's epics, ""Return"" is probably too much of a spit-take to examine from a sociological viewpoint. And yet This movie set out to reinvent zombies for the eighties. Eighties, the cocaine decade. These zombies eat brains to dull the pain of death, like coke heads snort to dull the pain of life. When they've had their hit, the undead are hopped up, running and leaping all over the place. Freddie's slow death represents another type of drug abuse, a junkie fading to sedatives. Until, finally reaching rock bottom, he's not recognized by love ones, transformed into totally different creatures. Notably, these zombies don't pass their condition on through bites. It's born out of the air, out of the crowded, urban cemeteries they live in. The government's response to the pandemic? Nuke it from orbit. Reading too much in to it? Probably.""Return"" is widely regarded as a hallmark punk movie. No doubt, when cast members wear tattered leather and have chains in their faces. But punk wasn't as homogeneous in 1985 as it is now. Suicide, Scuz, Spider, and Trash would fit in fine at a Circle Jerks concert but Chuck and Casey would probably be more comfortable in a new wave club. (This almost justifies squeaky-clean Tina hanging out with the bawdy punks. Almost.) The soundtrack isn't straight-ahead either. You'd be hard-pressed to hear psychobilly like ""Surfin' Dead"" or sleazy dance-pop like ""Tonight (We'll Make Love til We Die)"" on a punk station these days. The punk aesthetic was chosen to distinguish the cast from typical eighties slasher fodder. It succeeds in that regard, even if the teens aren't developed much. Mark Venturini's hilarious monologue about his punk bonafides and Miguel Nunez being the first black guy to make it to the end are the only time the kids truly shine. Linnea Quigley, decked out in a Ziggy Stardust wig and not much else, is either intentionally playing her character deadpan, a bad actress, or stoned out of her mind. Either way, she's hilarious. Her nearly feature-length nude scene is the stuff of eighties horror legend.The older cast members truly own this one. James Karen and Clu Gulager both get uproarious bits to themselves. Karen, when he goes from panicky to calm with just a sip of coffee. Gulager when he has to explain the rabid weasel situation. The film makes excellent use of both veteran character actors. Don Calfa's Ernie, who is almost definitely a Nazi, is maybe the stand-out, reacting calmly to the escalating situation, never loosing his hilarious, morbid matter-of-factness.While predominantly a pitch-black dark comedy, ""Return"" isn't without scares or pathos. A zombie leaping through a window, disposing of a pesky phone, is a great jump scare. Frank's final fate is weirdly sincere, as are the character's genuine panic over the increasingly bleak predicament. Yes, ""Return of the Living Dead"" is truly one of the best zombie movies ever made. Pretty much zero other films in the sub-genre matches its balance of wit, inventiveness, and sense of fun. Especially its' four sequels, all lackluster affairs.",The Return of the Living Dead

103,spencergrande6,This movie is like very little else out there,8,7 July 2017,"This movie is like very little else out there. It's a zombie comedy that isn't a full-on splatterfest like most, doesn't offer some overly humorous social satire (there's subtle jabs at Agent Orange and Nazis), and doesn't have a high-concept premise (for a zombie movies that is). What you have is dry as hell, with punk rockers (timely for the time - Repo Man meets zombies?), Nazi morticians smoking pipes and listening to their Walkman while embalming, and Quigley nudity for its own sake, but characters are in on it and equally celebrate and scold her. It has iconic scenes and quotes though I'm sure a lot of people have no idea they're actually from this.It just works - it's funny, weird, creepy, gory, and always entertaining. A hard mix to pull off and one that happens with success very rarely. It's always said that there's a fine line between horror and comedy - the pros can straddle it like a daring high-wire act and this is one of them. If only the ending weren't so abruptly anti- climactic and there were a few more naked zombie Quigley kill scenes it'd be a perfect cult classic.Gotta love the very serious Suicide while naked Quigley grinds on him: ""No one understands me, you know that."" ""You think this is a f***in' costume? This is a way of life."" ""Hey, what's wrong with you, man? Show some f***ing respect for the dead, will ya?""

(laughs)Hey this Dan O'Bannon flick is almost as over-the-top as anything George Romero ever did.  Hell, I think it's even better than CREEPSHOW if ya wanna know the truth.  And the ending involving a nuclear-tipped artillery shell is so over-the-top ridiculous that even I can stand it.  Usually I hate dumb stuff like that, but not in this case.Some bodies that were mistakenly shipped by the Army to a medical supply firm, accidentally leaks toxic fumes and contaminate James Karen and Thom Mathews because they were near a canister of the stuff.  These bodies were contaminated by a toxic waste spill that leaked into the ground and brought the rotting corpses in nearby cemeteries back to life.Anyway, the gas leaks out and the first rotting corpse comes back to life, the incredible black-tar melting man.  It's the coolest special effect for the whole movie, imo.  Then the gas escapes into the vents and brings the 'yellow man' dead body in the freezer back to life while Karen and Mathews are slowly turning into the walking dead.In the meantime, some punk rocker friends of Mathews are hanging out in the cemetery next door waiting for him to get off work and as the escaped gas gets into the rainwater, it seeps underground and starts bringing all the dead corpses back to life.  This is happening while Linnea Quigley dances around in the cemetery all naked and all.The owner of the medical supply firm (Clu Gulager) comes back and freaks out over the mess that's taken place.  They wind up having to take the now chopped yellow man corpse over to the crematoria next door where the mortician (Don Calfa) is drawn in to their predicament.   Then all hell breaks loose around the mortuary/crematoria.Gore highlights include:--The black tar melting man is incredible.  He yells ""braaaaains...""    as he bites a hunk of skull out of one of the punk rocker dudes (Mark Venturini).--Two paramedics are attacked by the zombies and one of them gets his brains eaten out in a cool gore scene.  O'Bannon in the separate DVD audio track said the actor ate real calf brains.  Yeech...--A half-rotting female corpse is tied down on the embalming table and says that they need to eat brains in order to take away the pain.  This is right after she just took a hunk of skull out of another one of the punker dudes.The MGM DVD utilized a nice, widescreen anamorphic print, or you can flip it over view it in it's standard full-screen size.

111,jamhorner,A Fashionable Return,8,24 February 2008,"This movie is like punk rock meets ""American Graffiti"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead,"" when all mixed together you get Return of the Living Dead; probably one of the best zombie flicks that was not done by George A. Romero. Essentially this movie is about a group of people and young rebels who unwillingly, and accidentally, open a drum of chemicals that brings the dead back to life. This movie is very well made since it made numerous references to ""Night"" and the way in which the zombies act and attacked people. The acting, to say the least, was very over dramatic, there was some good scares and gore and I loved the punk rock theme that they had. This movie was just really well done and the only thing that I did not like about this movie was the overuse of the F word and the unnecessary nudity. Cursing is okay, but in small amounts, but should not be overused like in this movie.First off, the plot structure was vastly different from your typical zombie flick, in a good way. It plays on the fact that ""Night"" really happened and it was true that the dead coming to life. It provides a reasonable and logical explanation behind the walking dead. While everybody knows that to kill a zombie, you must take the head off or damage the brain; in this movie, this is not true, they are still living after you take the head off. You cannot kill what is already dead. What was so different about these zombies was that they were completely conscience of their actions, they can talk and not mumble and they provide, through dialogue, why they have the craving for brains. I find this approach very unique and very different. This movie even plays on the theme of individualism through the lead rebel of the rebellious gang. He explains that his clothes, which is nothing but black leather and chains, is an expression of his being, but never explains why. Therefore it provides to be a great quagmire. To some extent it shows the rebellious side of the 80s.The acting was very similar to that of The Toxic Avenger; it was so over-dramatic that it was good. Two the lead characters in the beginning of the movie, played by James Karen and John Philbin, did a great job playing a panicky role, but so overdone. Clu Gulager, the male lead actor, also did a great job of being optimistic and his friend did a great job of being a bit skeptical, played by Don Calfa. The roles and performances that deserve a big applause for ""Most Over-dramatic Performance"" should go to Mark Venturini, who lays Suicide, Linnea Quigley, who plays Trash the death enthusiast and Beverley Randolph, who is the love interest of Phipin's Chuck character. However, if not for these performances, this movie would not have the b-movie and cheesy feel that made this film so entertaining. When you think about it, it's the acting that makes it work.The blood and the gore is very limited when you compare it to some zombie flicks, however, it is very effective. The gore limits itself to zombie make-up and some eating scenes so that way they don't overpower the film with unnecessary blood and guts. There is a scene, that should be notable, that has a zombie melting and decomposing which I though was very well done for it's time like what American Werewolf did for werewolf transformation. Even at some points were directors would go crazy with blood and guts, they try not to embellish; this style is best shown through one of the zombies that just got acid thrown on its face, but there is not blood, just cauterized eyes and mouth. There weren't that many scenes that were ""jump out"" scary scenes, though it didn't phase me. Granted, it had good intentions and they had good ideas, but nothing. I guess for me there were more funny scenes that real scary scenes, but that's another thing that makes this movie work so much, the almost slapstick, tongue-in-cheek horror.The one thing that I really enjoyed about this film is the punk rock theme that was present through the entire film. As soon as the zombies bust out o the ground, hard rock and roll starts to blast through the speakers. It really brings the zombie genre to a whole new level of excellence. Even a majority of the main characters seem like they kind of guys that like rock and roll. It's just a fun theme to play with and works very well with the zombie genre; evidenced by the remake of Dawn of the Dead, when they played ""Get Down with the Sickness."" Though for me, it really gave this movie that retro 80s theme that I love so much. Rock N' roll and horror mixed together, it's a good thing.Overall, this movie is just one great roller coaster with some great thrills, creature features, rock and roll, over-dramatic acting and a whole mess of zombies and action. I'm glad that this movie was made because it paves the road for a whole new outlook on the zombie genre and give a new style of viewing the living dead as well as destroy it. It's just a fun movie to watch and just really entertaining in horror sense.

For me, I love this movie way too much.",The Return of the Living Dead
112,mungflesh,Genius from the co-creator of Alien,8,30 August 2004,"ROTLD is one of the rare cases where horror meets comedy to good effect. With some classic lines like ""you gotta hit the brain"" and ""watch your mouth kid if you like this job"", this film works because it doesn't rely solely on gore or stupidity; the script is very well written.ROTLD pays homage to George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" but veers away from the slow lumbering zombies of the '68 classic, and instead gives us ""the original"" super zombies (ie before 28 days later or Dawn of the Dead remake) that are not so easily dealt with! This proves to be an interesting problem for the script to resolve which I think it does with style by the end of the movie.The characters are a little predictable and one dimensional except for the lead pair who are introduced at the start of the movie, but that's perhaps the only flaw. What I really like about this movie is that, whilst not entirely a gorefest, it still manages to kick-ass because of the flawless plot. By this I mean that there a few scenarios where you find yourself saying ""that's just dumb"" or ""they'd never do that"" etc, which is very rare nowadays in the horror/sci-fi genre. Dramas & thrillers etc get an easy job of it because all they have to do is convince us that their reality is real-life. Horror on the other hand needs to convince that the unreality it portrays is what is real-life, and that's not always an easy task.ROTLD is funny, sick, clever and above all entertaining if you can stomache some pretty twisted content. Personally, I love it.",The Return of the Living Dead
113,kyle_c,*** out of ****,7,2 September 2002,"Solid horror effort by Dan O'Banon is one of the best zombie movies ever made.  Referencing George Romero's masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Return"" attempts to both lightly spoof it and unofficial continue the story, to a largely successful degree.  A few scenes seem misplaced and unnecessary, but the comic and horror elements both work well, with some very funny and some very frightening moments.  Regarded as a cult classic, it still carries lots of mainstream appeal.",The Return of the Living Dead
114,Snake-666,One of the best horror comedies!,6,16 August 2003,"In this zombie-spoof of George A. Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead' (1968) the employees, and eventually the owner, of a medical supplies company find themselves in big trouble after the accidental release into the atmosphere of a chemical that resurrects the dead. As hundreds of zombies rise from the grave it becomes apparent that they are only interested in one thing  brains!Return of the Living Dead' is a horror comic masterpiece. Taking obvious influences from Romero's Dead' trilogy yet still remaining respectful to its inspiration this movie delivers some great special effects, an awesome soundtrack and some of the finest comedy to be found in horror. In a similar way to how Scream' (1996) parodied the horror genre so does ROTLD' but in a way more `in your face' than Scream. Not afraid to pick faults and exploit clichés (such as the girl who gets naked for no reason) ROTLD' stays far truer to the roots of the movies that influenced it at the time and that aids it in remaining enjoyable.Everything that makes good horror cheese so fun is featured in this movie from the hammy acting of stars Clu Gulager, Thom Matthews, Don Calfa and James Karen through to the respectable special effects and zombie make-up. Watching this movie and seeing a thousand zombies suddenly poor out of nowhere is an awe-inspiring sight in some respects.The movie has some problems, perhaps maybe a little too ludicrous for some and I must admit in places the story seems to drag but taking all the minor problems into consideration I recommend this movie to horror (comedy) fans and any fan of Romero's Dead' trilogy and similar zombie movies who fancy a good chuckle with those movies in mind. My rating for Return of the Living Dead'  7.5/10.",The Return of the Living Dead
115,alanmora,"""Do you wanna party?""",10,21 January 2008,"""Return of the Living Dead"" is a terrific tongue-in-cheek horror spoof that has developed a rabid and devoted cult following and with good reason. This is the most fun you will ever have with a horror film. It refuses to take itself too seriously yet the blood flows freely and the effects, considering the cheap budget this film was on, are very well done. It brags a wonderful cast that consists of James Karen, Clu Gulager, Don Calfa, and the legendary scream queen Linnea Quigley. It seems that two bumbling workers at a medical supply warehouse inadvertently open up a tank that wound up at their warehouse years earlier through government error. This tank releases a toxic chemical that starts a chain reaction that is impossible to end. Everything they do seems to make matters worse! The corpse inside the tank comes to life and when another corpse inside the warehouse comes to life panic begins to set in. It is soon discovered that these zombies, unlike those in the movies, cannot be killed with a mere blow to the brain. They also have an insatiable appetite themselves for human brains (apparently eating brains helps to stop the pain of being dead, who knew?). When the cadaver is cut into pieces, the pieces go after them! An attempt is made to burn the pieces and this sends fumes into the air which creates an acid rain storm. The rain seeps into the ground at a nearby cemetery and brings all of the corpses back to life. Lucky for the zombies there is a group of punk rock teenagers partying in the cemetery and paramedics and police are on their way to join the party! This movie is a lot of fun to watch and is the type of movie that can be watched over and over again. Avoid the hideous sequels though!",The Return of the Living Dead
116,timhayes-1,The funniest zombie movie ever?,7,20 November 2006,"Dan O'Bannon's Return Of The Living Dead sure has one heck of a history. It actually took this movie a decade to get made. It started out as a spec script by Night Of The Living Dead co-scripter John Russo. When George Romero put his own sequel into production Russo's script went into the drawer but was later taken out again and turned into a novel by the author. Then it became a script property again. Tobe Hooper was set to direct but he had to pull out due to prior commitments. Then Dan O'Bannon came aboard, did a script rewrite and took the reins of director. while it would have been interesting to see the film in its initial stages as a straight sequel to Night, it sure makes for one funny zombie flick as O'Bannon made it. Who by now doesn't know the immortal line of ""send more paramedics""? You simply can't be a zombie fan if you haven't seen this film. There are a great many gags that will leave you chuckling from the two morons being told that they can't be sick cause they're already dead to a reanimated dog. This film is hilarious.

They're rotting flesh, brain eating, maggot spewing, bundles of moaning joy, and this one has it all. 1985 was an important year for the punk and metal movements, combine that with a hysterical gore fest and we all jump for fist pounding jubilation. An Army experiment goes wrong and releases a deadly gas that turns the eternally resting into brain hungry zombies, and what could be funnier then that? Clu Gulager and James Karen should have become the next Laurell and Harty for their performances here, the perfect blend of comedy and gore. Now let's throw in a naked Linnea Quigley and we have a real party on our hands. Well written and acted from beginning to end, the effects and lighting produce an eerie backdrop for the well thought out punchlines. By far my favorite O'Bannon film, and a time capsule to the 80's. Any true horror fan will absolutely love this one...",The Return of the Living Dead
118,boondocksaint20,So-so remake/spoof of George Ramero's classic,6,6 December 2002,"I remember vaguely, seeing this one on cable as a kid...it scared the crap out of me.  Mainly, the scares were derived from the fact that the zombies in this film, unlike Romero's films, were very hard to kill.  After reading so many positive reviews on this site, I decided to check it out again, uncut, and over fifteen years later...unfortunately, unlike all of the die hard Romero fans out there, I was thoroughly disapointed.Now, I love the first two 'Dead' films by George Romero and think that Day of the Dead was not too bad, but this one, I am simply shocked at all of the positive reviews.  If this was a horror comedy, where was the comedy?  I can see, somewhat, the comedy in all of the 'lambs to the slaughter' deaths, but the rest of it, seems to me, as played as a pure horror flick.
As a horror film, it is not bad.  Though, I did not like the fact that these zombies were apparently immune to hails of bullets and having their limbs chopped off, the movie itself was not a bad time waster.  Dan O'Bannon did a good job directing this film, especially with the origin of the zombies...yet, the film seems way too short, even for an 80's slasher flick. The first 50 minutes are spent showing how the zombies rise from the dead and how a group of 80's punks go about having a party in 'Resurrection Cemetary', a fitting name for an ironic end.  The last 40 minutes or so is a pure zombie chaos-athon...which is good and bad.  It was scary at first seeing zombies that could think and could move very fast, but after awhile it became comical.  Okay, the thinking behind seeing a movie where the dead rises from the grave is comical enough, but pushing aside the viewers with no sense of humor that would rate this movie badly based upon that, the fact that the humans did not stand even a chance against corpses that had been rotting for years and yet, had more than the average stamina of the average human being seemed incredibly far-fetched and utterly unenjoyable.  I mean, I love Dead Alive and The Evil Dead b\c of the humor/horror element, and also, most importantly, that the main character/characters towards the end of the films were kicking zombie butt.  Not true in this one.  The humans simply run, flail about a bit, swing a few hammers, but are utterly defeated by the menace.  Believe it or not though, I did kinda like the ending, but, considering the 84 minute running time, it came way too soon.  I felt there could have been so much more time devoted to suspense or the plot of the survivors, but no, just when it is getting interesting, the movie ends with an almost cop-out ironic twist that would have been 10 times better had the movie been just a little bit longer and more frightening.  That's right, the movie just ends all of a sudden, opening up for yet another sequel.  I appreciated the irony in it, but, that's not what I wanted from this one, I wanted to see more survival horror, not a pathetic excuse for comedy-horror.Overall, not bad.  Decent acting for an 80's flick, especially Thom Matthews of Friday the 13th Part 6 fame, and there were some nice zombie creatures, especially the one trapped in the basement (that was one of the best all-time zombie creatures that I have seen).  However, there is not nearly as much gore as other viewers put, but enough to satisfy the 'gore hounds' I'm sure.  Better than most 80's horror films, but yet, this one is lacking so much, namely substance.  Most viewers will be really unsatisfied with the ending, especially since O'Bannon spends more than 50% of the meager running time explaining the origin of the zombies and not having enough zombie menacing action, nor suspense for our characters to go through.  Overall, though, not a bad film, but, in my opinion, if the filmmaker's intent was to be a tribute to George A. Romero then it is simply sub-par, pound for pound. 6/10 stars.  One whole star is added for the acting, the always good Miguel A. Nunez (yeah, the same guy who played in the bomb, ""Juwanna Mann""), the fully naked chick and the good musical score (which reminds me so much of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, made 15 years later).  I would have rated this one higher if only it had been a bit longer, had more suspense and a slighly better plot to justify the quick and like I said, almost cop-out ending.  That is my story and I am sticking to it.",The Return of the Living Dead

120,CaressofSteel75,Awesome~ but pretty violent,8,27 March 2018,"Return of the Living Dead is over-the-top zombie action that ranks up there with the greats. Two dimwits in a medical supply house crack open a long forgotten army barrel that contains gas that brings the dead back to life. The gas seeps into the graveyard next door, and the zombies rise from their graves.It's definitely as much comedy as it is horror. Clu Gulager and James Karen in particular are hilarious, but don't be fooled- seeing this again recently I have to say that it's a violent movie. Linnea Quigley also shows a lot of skin in this, so if you're sensitive to that, please be advised. Whatever it is, it's a great 1980s B movie, so if you're in to that- this is one of the best from that era.",The Return of the Living Dead

It's a very eighties movie with all the normal characters you will be used to finding, it's quite Troma-esque. The sound-track is one of the best parts the songs are really cool especially 'Party Time', 'Burn the Flames' & 'Tonight' really kick ass music! the effects are wonderful, the humour is really dark and funny using the rules of the genre to the fullest while breaking them all at the same time. For example these zombies don't stop with a simple bullet to the head which makes them all the more terrifying! When the black zombie lunges shouting ""BRAINS"" you have to get a chill down your spine! Also Linnea Quigley displays her 'talents' once more in this film which is also quite fun :). It even manages to explain everything in the movie itself well and the characters can really be felt for and laughed at all at the same time. The ending was a bit of a cop out but silly enough to end the movie which had really painted itself into a corner and any other ending might have been just as much of a cop-out so really it couldn't have been done much better.

Zombies coming back from the dead after a shower of toxic rain is a pretty thin plot but the action makes up for it.

126,horror7777,One of the best films ever made!!,10,3 August 2000,"As far as ANY film goes, The Return of the Living Dead goes farther!  Clu Gulager, as Burt, is brilliant.  It's funny to watch his mood swing back from totally hilarious to totally insane to totally...  He is a veteran actor that comes out in full glory here.  James Karen is also truly fun to watch.  I hope I have a job with someone like him as my boss!  He can make you laugh and cry in the same scene!  Don Calfa, as Ernie, has never been better.  As for guys who work in funeral homes, he comes out on top!  He is smart, as well as serious, as well as funny!  Linnea Quigley is gorgeous, even with the make up.  She proves to be an even better scream queen than Jamie Lee Curtis, or anyone else for that matter!  She is a great actress and in this film it truly shows in her portrayal of Trash.  Thom Mathews is great!  Him and James Karen (Frank and Freddy) truly are great together if their talents are used properly(which sadly didn't continue in ROTLD 2). Thom Mathews is a great actor, this was his first film and he did everything correctly.  Jewel Shepard and John Philbin were a PAIR!  They played Casey and Chuck, two members of the punk group.  They were great together, and it seemed to me that Casey did have an inner love for Chuck.  Miguel Nunez played Spider, one of the smarter punks.  He helped everyone out a lot using his talents.  Beverly Randolph played Tina, Freddy's girlfriend.  She was smart, but a shy girl who wasn't brave.  She seemed to be an outcast punk, who only joined the group because of Freddy was a member.  And the saying ""I'll love you to death"" certainly came true in her case.  Her love for Freddy was not teenage love, but real love.  Mark Venturi played Suicide, the leader of the punks ""whenever they need a ride"".  He is the object of Trash's love, although even when she isn't fully dressed, he'd rather ""show respect for the dead""!  Brian Peck played Scuz, an insecure punk who gave the other punks the idea to ""check out the cemetary over there"". Resurrection Cemetary was a clever and funny name, I think.  Jonathan Terry and the late Cathleen Cordell were accordingly 'couple of the month' in my book.  Mrs. Glover is quiet and patient.  Colonel Horace Glover is a anxious Army colonel waiting for the ""Night of the Living Dead"" tanks to show up. And he will continue to use the equipment in his house even if it does bother his wife's oven.  Anyway, the make up zombie effects were great. They were better THAN ANY GEORGE ROMERO FILM!!  The extras, the paramedics, the cops, etc. were played well and complete.  The soundtrack, available on Enigma, features songs from: The Cramps, 45 Grave, The Jet Black Berries, the Flesheaters, etc.  The theme song didn't make it to the soundtrack (?), but the other songs are perfect and add rhythm and culture to the film. Even little scenes like the late Derrick Brice as a gunnary sargeant and the Burt and Ernie Sesame Street connection were incredibly funny!  Dan O'Bannon, who wrote the screenplay for Alien and Total Recall, wrote the screenplay for ROTLD as well as make his directing debut.  Stanzi Strokes, who did the casting for ""SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT"", returned to do the casting here.  This is the best casting EVER!!  Another note: George Romero sued Dan O'Bannon for the use of ""living dead"" in the title.  George Romero lost (HA! HA!) and the courts ruled in favor of O'Bannon.  I also heard that Tobe Hooper and George Romero were supposed to direct ROTLD together. However, Laurel Entertainment told Romero not to get involved with ROTLD because it might be confused with one of his garbage zombie films.  Then they informed him to sue...  Anyway, ROTLD was released by Orion under Cinema '84, A Greenburg Brothers Partnership and was a Hemdale Pictures/ Fox Films Corporation picture.  ROTLD is out of print and rare and very expensive to buy online, though sometimes you can get a break and find it on Amazon. Com's Zshops.  I was lucky to buy ROTLD on Amazon's Zshops for a low price and it is in excellent working condition.  The soundtrack I bought as well and it is in great working condition.  You have to be patient.  Any critic who has given ROTLD a bad review, needs to see it again or hates exceptional movies.  Also: avoid ROTLD 2 and ROTLD 3 as they are cheap and relentlessly pay homage to ROTLD.

No, I'm here now to tell you that I'm a little confused.  People have commented that ONE OF MY FAVORITES is A JOKE.  Am I correct?  In response to this, I say that IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A FILM BEFORE AND YOU STAY UP LATE TO WATCH IT ON TV TO SEE IT BATTERED AND EDITED- WHY BOTHER?  I happened to tape the TNT Version, and saw that it had been EDITED EVEN WORSE than back on MONSTER VISION MAY 1999. I thought it looked terrible!  But then again, most films are HEAVILY EDITED ON TV!  I suggest you go out and rent or (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) BUY THE THING!  THEN WATCH IT AND COMMENT ON IT!!More To Note: (Possible Spoilers)Tarman was covered in more than ""black smudge"".  It actually took a lot of work to make Tarman Tarman!  Scuz was not turned into a zombie after being bitten by the Legless Corpse because there was not enough Trioxin left to resurrect him!  And don't be so sure he didn't come back to life.  I mean, the camera never flashed back to that room afterwards!  And, if you look closely.  The 1/2 Woman Corpse WAS A WHOLE WOMAN when she bit Scuz, but was chopped into a half-woman by Burt(Clu Gulager) when she was still outside! Trash and the dead police officer turned into zombies because the majority of the Trioxin Chemical was out there.  The whole cemetery and surrounding areas were covered with it by the ""acid rain"".  As for her speaking, she might have had a piece of vocal cord left!  IT ISN'T THAT HARD TO BELIEVE!!BUT I SUPPOSE AS MY FRIEND SAYS ""WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE WHO DISLIKES YOUR FILM.  IT'S JUST THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS!"" 
THIS IS TRUE!!   THE MOVIE IS NEVER THE SAME ON TV.  IT'S ALWAYS SLICED AND DICED BY THE TV PEOPLE.  THE ORIGINAL INGENUITY IS ALWAYS REMOVED AND I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE WOULD STAND FOR IT!!

The acting is 1st class providing some unparalleled performances. To have such a magnificent selection of odd ball characters in the same movie is one in a Billion. The late Dan O'Bannon died far to early and this movie is testament to that. The music, characters, script, and some of the best use of traditional prosthetics and effects techniques ever, all help make this movie a cult classic.

129,CantileverCaribou,Seminal comedy horror with little of either.,3,30 October 2016,"Probably some spoilers here, but if your viewing experience is ruined by spoilers, then it probably wasn't a good movie, anyway.The military sends a bunch of canisters containing zombies to be held in a medical supply warehouse, but they seem to forget that they did so, and they don't have any records of it. So the two bumbling employees accidentally crack the canister with an ol' pat on the back and breathe the stuff in, while the fumes are also circulated to a cadaver and everything escalates from there.Nothing is really all that funny. It's just sort of goofy and absurd, like zombies calling for backup so they can eat more BRAINS. The split dogs content is hysterical-other than that, it's all exaggerated acting, a bunch of silly punks who listen to '80s trash. And comedy elements are obviously going to diminish the horror aspects. Like most comedy horror, it's a bastardized oddity that never really merges the two well.The pacing is quite slow, and the gore is often rather tame compared to many movies of the era. Not really any pig intestines or effects outside of zombie makeup-most of the zombies, other than the one in the canister, also look quite normal and bland. They only eat brains, not people, as one of the captured zombies tediously elaborates upon, so it's far less messy... Hell, when the aptly named ""Trash"" has her fantasy of being torn apart by men ironically and unsurprisingly met, she's subsequently left wandering around naked, not a mark on her body and no evidence of head trauma.There's not much tension because of the silliness either, so it's just boring. The ending is rather hilarious after everything the characters have been through, and, in typical '80s fashion, it leaves an opening for a franchise, which did occur. Some footage, however, is reused during the ending, which makes it appear even cheaper.Decent for fans of '80s schlock, but mostly a waste of time.",The Return of the Living Dead

Other standout performances come from Linnea Quigley who plays ""Trash"", a punk who loves to strip naked in graveyards!!!

The effects for the zombies are great.....................well at times the zombies look bad, but for the most part they look pretty damn good. (Especially Tarman, he looks awesome.) Now the acting is also good. They are very, very, very, passable. Now what needs to be noted in this movie are the zombies. They are very similar yet different than the stereotypical zombie. For example they say the word brains a lot, which I see zombies doing a lot of in comedies. The differences are that, for one thing, THEY CAN TALK! Most zombies we see are very silent, but no these guys. Another thing is that they can run, sure thats common for zombies to run today but back then it wasn't. Finally, in this movie it is not as easy to kill the Zombies in this film as it is in others. Because here you have to destroy every single molecule in there body.

133,Zod-2,Not bad but why all the yelling?,7,3 September 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!One of the reasons I find Night of the Living Dead so annoying to watch is due to the fact that almost every line is delivered by a yelling actor. Once the zombie's arrive, Return of the Living Dead, isn't much different. Granted if the dead were to come back to life I would probably be pretty tense and yell alot but that's not about to happen.  If I can suspend my disbelief that the dead are coming back to life then I can suspend my disbelief that the characters could act a bit more calmly, perhaps starting out really freaked but gathering their wits a little once they get used to the fact they are surrounded my zombies.I had high hopes for this movie after reading several positive reviews on this and other websites.  I had heard that Return part 1 is much better then Parts II and III and after seeing those two movies I thought ""heck, how could it be worse?"" and thankfully it isn't.  The movie is well put together.  I only wish more suspense had been used.  The zombies, in my opinion, are too fast.  Any scenes that have a hope of being suspenseful are over too quickly as the humans are quickly overtaken by the zombies. Instead of having a good build up to a scare, the viewer is given a few quick shocks and then the action is over.  The best scene in the movie takes place in the basement of the army surplus store when Tina goes down there to look for Freddy.  Good suspense and an excellent, scary looking zombie.  If only more of the movie had been like that.I have never been a fan of zombie movies where the zombie can't be killed and I'm still not.  I think this fact really hurts the movie.  If the zombies can't be killed how do you end it?  The ending of the movie feels like the film makers didn't know how to end it so they just ended it. 
Overall Return of the Living dead is okay.  But 1 really good zombie and 2 other interesting ones just isn't enough for me.  The acting is quite good when the actors aren't yelling and the characters, even though they are punks, are quite smart and do what they should do to survive.  Also Dan O'Bannon at least takes some time to try and explain why the zombies do what they do.  The best of the series but still only a 5 out of 10.",The Return of the Living Dead

Truly ahead of its time with Running and Talking Zombies! Classic! I can really understand the confusion in the title alone. A lot of people thought it was a continuation of the George A. Romero movies. But it's not. It's sort of a comic spoof/homage to them. But it does have that ""Night of the Living Dead"" quality to it. And why not? John Russo and Russell Streiner of the original, were involved in the writing of it!. I enjoyed how good/silly the acting, the music, the action was, all good!

136,ravenus,Blackly humorous gore comedy,9,3 October 2004,"RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD (1985) - Dan O' BannonThis spin-off of the Living Dead series came from sharing of copyright between George Romero and co-writer John Russo. While Romero went to continue the narrative with Dawn and Day of the Dead, both bleak social satire/horrors, Russo undertook a humorous and far more chaotic reprise of the original story.Writer/director Dan O' Bannon pulls out all the stops for a gut-busting entertainer. The story begins with a bang and from then on moves at a dizzying pace piled on by the minute with increasingly outrageous events. From a strip tease in a graveyard to a massive showdown between the zombies and the law, and a way-over-the-top climax, this movie is a pinnacle of pitch-black zany humor.Unlike Romero's zombies the ones in RoTLD move fast and can speak (they use police radios, like a takeout service, to call for more reinforcements). Head shots don't do them in any more, since even their severed body parts can move and grasp at prey. Thankfully they're not just good make-up effects, but also have distinct personalities that add tremendously to the film's fun value.The film is chock-full of good humor and tongue-in-cheek genre touches (like the graveyard being named as 'Resurrection Cemetry'). The people behind this movie seemed to have had a great time making it and I sure had a great time watching this one.

It the most plausible of the zombies movies - the zombies being caused by 'Trioxine', escaping from the defense department.

In this case, it's the talking zombies. Not many though, so that aspect wasn't too bad. And 1 incident where a zombie is being asked questions was actually not bad.

Made by one of the writers of the Night of the Living Dead it takes a more a comedic tone than the former. Right from the moment they play the cheesy soundtrack when the Zombie or the Living Dead appears you know this is going to be one heck of a ride. Much like Evil Dead 2 it accomplishes and executes the Horror - Comedy part of it to perfection.A group of teenagers with nothing better to do hang out at a cemetery while all hell is breaking loose at a near by medical supply store that supplies cadavers. You can call this movie the first instance of the fast zombies. Zombies that ran instead of dragging their feet everywhere.As we progress we learn that the events of The Night of the Living Dead actually happened but the army hushed it up. Some chemical causes this to happen. The whole event turns out to be some army manufactured disaster that was kept quite for years but is returning to haunt everyone. The virus spreads and slowly the entire city is filled with the living dead as the teenagers and owner of the medical supply store battle it out and try to stay alive.Return of the Living dead is the perfect film to put in a good movie.

145,m_jordan_jones,A real scream for chiller fans!!! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS,7,9 March 2005,This is a pretty good horror film. It kept me entertained and the acting was good. But there wasn't enough violence. The goriest part in the film was where this biker looking dude gets his head chewed up. This film is a classic and is a decent horror movie. Starts out a little boring though. After the beginning of the film it starts to get better. This film is better than it's sequel Return of the living dead part 2. But this one doesn't top the third entry. The third one had all the over the top gore and good acting. This one is still pretty good though some missing violence. To most horror fans this would be considered a masterpiece. Well I recommend this film to any horror fan or chiller fan. I rate this film a 7/10.,The Return of the Living Dead

It is not scary and it has NO connection to Romero's Living dead series as so many idiots think.This movie is just so good and you can't help but love the characters Clu Gulager and Don Calfa were great playing Burt and Ernie, and the punk kids were amazing, but the duo of James Karen and Thom Matthews was maybe just the funniest duo ever to hit the big screen. Perfect.The writing by the great Dan 'O Bannon (who also did a swell job as director) was flawless.

It's not taken overly seriously, but still manages to keep all the crucial elements intact. There is a little bit of black humor mixed in to keep it on the lighter side and overall it works really well.I love the scene where the first corpse is reanimated. It's one of the best scenes in any zombie movie.

These reanimated corpses are hungry, and they're not vegetarians! This is not only my favorite zombie film but is also one of my favorite horror films of all time. I don't think I've ever had as much fun with a movie ever! They sure don't make 'em like this anymore. This movie has everything you could want in a horror film: a creepy setting, lots of blood and gore galore, scary looking zombies, interesting characters, and a great plot! This semi sequel to Night of the Living Dead should be a favorite of any horror movie goer and a must have for gorehounds like me.

150,TheyKilledTheGiggler,THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE!!!,10,24 November 2001,"Dan O'Bannon's satrical take on George A. Romero's cult-classic ""Night of the living dead"" is hands down the greatest horror movie ever made. Don't believe me? Then watch it yourself all alone in the dark and tell me what you think!! (if you can find it. This movie is also very rare and hard to find) ROTLD has it all, Horror, comedy, great 80's punk music, a great cast, an awesome plotline, and last but not least ZOMBIES! What makes it better is that these zombies are a lot better than the bumbling stiffs from Romero's ""dead series"". These zombies are more entertaining to watch because they can run, talk, and well....eat brains. Unlike Romero's zombies which never spoke,were not scary at all, and could not run (nevermind run they could barely walk. ROTLD has more livlier zombies not to mention an entertaining cast (Thom Matthews, Clu Gallager, Don Calfa, and Linnea Quiqley)which is a lot better than the annoying characters from the dead series. The movie which takes place on July 3, 1984 starts off when ""uneeda medical supply employee"" Frank tells newcoming teen Freddie about a chemical called 245 trioxin (which reportedly caused the dead to come to life in ""Night of the Living Dead"") which was accidently shipped to the very medical wearhouse the two are working at. Freddie, eager to see the cannisterd chemical goes down into the basement when Frank accidently causes the chemical to leak all over things with some comical results (ie the split dogs and the dead cadaver) After burning the contaminated things in the wearhouse the chemical is released into the air and as it starts to rain pours into a nearby graveyard which re-animates the dead. As a group of punks are trapped in the middle of it they must band together with the medical supply workers to fend off the fiends who are after fresh human brains. The story is dark and tense and the horror is nonstop in this classic. When i saw this movie for the first time when i was about 10 it scared the hell out of me. and even years later i still am afraid to watch this one alone. Out of all the zombie films ever made (night, dawn, and day of the dead, re-animator etc etc) Return of the Living Dead is the only film that manages to take pulse-pounding horror and special effects and mix it with dark humor and come out with a movie that you will never forget.

154,theblackscythe,A fun and sleazy 80's exploitation extravaganza.,9,31 October 2014,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #16)This film is so much fun. As a sequel to the original classic, it lacks most of the subtlety or weight of said original. However as its own creation, it is some of the most entertaining comedy-horror out there.Firstly, the film's actors are all charismatic and likable. Delivering the hilarious dialogue well and able to bring gravitas to the handful of more intense moments. More importantly here however is the sharp as a knife screenplay, filled with innumerable funny gags and clever moments. As a comedy the film is truly special, funny as anything you'll see using the horror genre as a skin. However RotLD does not simply use horror as a skin, it is a genuine entry within the genre, unlike some other satires. The zombie effects are genuinely great, and the atmosphere is solid. Both an amazing comedy, and a strong horror.The film also has a great plot, both for horror and comedy. Walking through numerous clichés and host to several great set pieces. In particular the first introduction of the zombie horde is great example of effects and scale. The film is joyfully drenched in sleaze and grindhouse charm (including a character who spends the majority of the film naked for no real reason).Overall, I loved this tasty ball of slime and dark humour.

157,moldwarrior,Return of the Living Dead: No It's Not a Sequel,8,26 October 2011,"Zombie films can be very different from each other. Romero's zombie films are bleak and often riddled with social commentary. This movie is horror/comedy. You know when a director has the balls to do something different from the popular stuff, this is that director.The story is basically a twist on NotLD where it was a real incident but Romero was told to fictionalize everything so the government wouldn't sue his ass. From this point on the film becomes a pretty good suspense and decent comedy. So the first half is comedy and suspense then BAM action/horror. That twist by itself works this film into the crack of genius.If this movie was made for zombie fans then it delivered since I am a huge zombie fan. I did have one beef and that is the sequel bait.

This rules, it changed my cinematic life and from time to time I quote the line ""send...more...paramedics"" just to see if anyone recognises it, but alas I fear the only people that would are all complimenting Return of the Living Dead on this web site.

It also explains why there wasn't really any scary moments. It is a spoof on zombie movies. So if you're expecting a true horror movie, you are not going to get it here.I really appreciated the special effects. There were graphic shots of people eating brains and chewing into skulls. This is really the only the reason why I gave this movie any points. That and Clu Gulager who played Burt Wilson. His sloppy speech and Member's Only jacket were the only things that were really funny.As for the zombies, there were retarded and lame. I really didn't laugh or chuckle at them. My reaction was more nonchalant than anything else.The acting is abysmal. I don't want to be too hard on Linnea Quigley, but her acting can best be described as completely awful. Her role, like every role she's ever had, is to run around naked. Did I mention this was one of the reasons why I gave this movie points? If I didn't, I should have.The ending was perhaps one of the worst I can think of. The special effects on the shot was laughable. Not funny, just stupid.Overall this movie is OK.

It's more intelligent that most other horror spoofs out there, and more thought-out than many supposedly serious zombie movies. The bulk of the humor comes from fairly understated parody of horror clichés and from clever exploitation of the discomfort we feel in the face of a seemingly unsolvable crisis.The movie begins with the accidental leak of a toxic chemical in a medical supply warehouse. It appears at first to be a manageable screw-up, but the situation quickly spirals into a full-blown zombie epidemic. As the crisis gets progressively more out of control, Return of the Living Dead gets more frightening and humorous, at the same time.",The Return of the Living Dead

Okay, I like horror films with a message, but it's nice to have a nice balance of humor and gore...something missing from contemporary films like ""Hostel"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes."" After more than 20 years, it can hold its own against recent zombie efforts like the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, ""Resident Evil"" and ""Land of the Dead."" Plus, the punk rock soundtrack adds a nice touch.

167,davidsawyer-me,One of the most under rated horror movies ever,10,14 May 2012,"I think that as a horror (slash) spoof (slash) comedy that this movie though extremely popular to this day has also been under rated. This was a well executed horror film. It also worked great with the brains eating spin. Also when the zombie explains why they eat brains gave it a sort of realism which added to the Science part of it being great ""Science-Fiction"". This movie was not only truly scary and disturbing but it was very comical as well. It also had some fantastic ""tee hee"" moments as well. Like when the kids ran up the basement stairs to get away from one of the zombies. What I mean by ""tee hee"" is that nervous kind of laughter like when you are kids and someone is playing the monster. Some part deep in side of you always actually gets scared even though you know it's not real. You laugh with a bubbly yet nervous ""tee hee"" or ""Eak"". I think that is what made the original Night of the living dead opening so great. when Barbara's brother was teasing her about the old man being a zombie. Then he turns out to be a real zombie. Sorry for any spoilers if you haven't seen either movie but I'm sure 90%+ of us have seen both by now. I sort of liked the other ""Return of the living dead"" films but they just can't hold a candle to the original. It's sort of like any movie from the 80s. There were a lot of great films like Poltergeist but the sequels fell short of recapturing that spark. I think that The Return of the Living Dead (1985) was & is one of the all time best horror comedies out there. Even with some of the effects being low budget or cheesy it was the 'way' in which they had them perform that made this film great.",The Return of the Living Dead

I'd heard of it,but never bothered to watch it until now.This movie was great fun. I hadn't expected the comedy elements in it. It kept my attention and gave me some good laughs. Even though the plot isn't a particularly deep one, the writing is excellent. The zombies aren't the slow, shambling, dim witted ones we're used to....Many can move quickly and and even talk. It's so nice to see a zombie movie that has the word..'brain, brains, brains' used so much. The zombies also had some of the funny lines.The film was cast perfectly. Each actor and actress made the most out of their character. I do so enjoy good acting in my horror flicks and this one has that. The action was pretty constant and I'd say gore isn't all that gory. I was drawn into the characters and was anxious to see who would survive. It has a good, solid script which makes the dialog interesting. I found the ending very satisfying.Most of all this is a fun film. It has a good balance of horror and comedy. I wish I had watched this movie years ago.

Not a bad flick; something of a spoof of the Romero ""Dead"" trilogy, with the zombies being much more fearsome owing to the fact that they are virtually unkillable and move just as quickly as regular folks.  Oh yeah, and they aren't just interested in any bit of flesh, they specifically want to chow on human ""brrrrraaaaiiiinnnnns,"" as they often remind the characters in the movie.
Above-average zombie entertainment, complete with gratuitous nude scene from B-movie queen Linnea Quigley, this tongue-in-cheek movie is good for a few laughs and even some decent gore effects.  Recommended for zombie movie fans who want their walking dead to come without the added depth of social commentary inherent in Romero's films.  But it doesn't touch Romero's work for sheer awesomeness.  And it doesn't go nearly as far in spoofing the zombie genre as Peter Jackson's ultra-gross-out, ""Dead Alive.""  Still, not crap, either.",The Return of the Living Dead
170,deancapetanelis,Can the undead commit suicide?,10,11 January 2006,"It's hard to blend comedy and horror and pull them both off. Twenty years before Shawn of the Dead made a zombie invasion chilling and funny Return of the Living Dead set the blueprint. This film plays back and forth between comedy and horror as if watching a tennis match but without losing the audience or feeling formulaic. That there are already 20 pages of user comments for a low budget film which the studio almost aborted shows how beloved this film is. However it's more then just entertainment it's a character study of what it's like to be undead. Although the film paints the cast in fairly one dimensional terms it treats the zombies with care and respect. These zombies are high functioning, alert and amazingly spry. Yes, there's the famous scene where one zombie orders up more policemen on the radio. There's also a scene where the living hold a conversation with the upper torso of one of the zombies and we discover why they want brains. This scene is more then just slightly reminiscent of the one in Independence Day where the president talks with a dead alien. The most poignant scene comes when we find out if it's possible for a zombie to commit suicide. At every step of the way the characters have a chance to fix things but only end up making it worse. Only Frank with his trip to the oven truly redeems himself. His sacrifice coming after he's pronounced dead by the EMT's again underscores how much more enlightened the dead can be.Is this film art? You bet. It has foreshadowing, drama, genuine pathos and follows the Greek tragedy formula of taking place within one revolution of the sun. Is this film great? Again, yes. It really injected life into the horror genre with faster more cerebral zombies. Will this film change the world? No not really. Just sit back and enjoy.",The Return of the Living Dead

172,theandreaceregini,A movie with a brain. Got it?,7,8 September 2019,"Wow. So this is what happens when a movie about zombies is written by someone who a) likes what they're doing and b) actually knows how to write for the big screen. Everything is perfectly dosed and mixed: comedy, tension, gore, action, music, character interaction... even the mandatory nudity part is incredibly spot-on, useful to build the character of Trash and way more tasteful than many other examples of mandatory nudity sequences (and this is saying alot, since what we're discussing here is a girl dancing completely nude in a graveyard!). This movie creates a narrative universe with a set of rules and surprisingly - for the genre - remains coherent to them from beginning to end, building a tense story that may be not the most original but certainly never stops to be enjoyable as hell. The Return of the Living Dead is, in my opinion, on the very same level of George Romero's 1978 Dawn of the Dead: different tones, of course, but the very same narrative strongness.",The Return of the Living Dead

But not just dead people, dead half dogs and dead butterflies, and more! I was a kid in a candy store watching this for the first time. This was the first horror movie I had ever seen that had a soundtrack that I genuinely liked. This movie was also my introduction to the amazing Linnea Quigley as the pink haired, death obsessed, stripping punk rocker by the name of Trash!

When two medical supply factory workers accidentally open a canister containing a zombie from a government project.  All hell breaks loose. (Plot was never a thing that zombie movies need anyway) While it may not be the classic that Romero's Night of the Living Dead is it works in a different way.  Going for the outrageous and outlandish more than the scary.  What do you expect from a horror movie with two friends named Burt and Ernie(in a zombie movie more or less). Like I said not for everyone but it is entertaining, funny, offensive, crude, and even has a couple of suspenseful moments.  Watching James Karen try to kill a re-animated split dog with a crutch and after dispatching two paramedics the zombies get on their CB asking to ""send more paramedics"" was just too funny for me.

It starts out sort of spoofing the Night of the Living Dead trilogy. One day, two workers Frank and Freddy (Karen and Thom Matthews) are just about to pack up at a medical storage factory, when Frank gets a bright idea to tell Freddy about the stored bodies that sit in the basement in tanks. Frank goes on and on about how there was a chemical spill in a hospital re-animating the dead bodies in the morgue, and how George Romero took that story and twisted it and molded it into his own movie. So Frank decides to take Freddy down and open up one of the tanks, releasing a deadly chemical that turns Freddy and Frank into Zombies, but that happens over the coarse of the movie. So what do they do now? They call the boss Burt (Gulager) to come and take care of everything. Now Burt get's a bright idea to take one of the bodies that escaped to the crematorium across the street and burn the body, now the smoke ejecting from the place goes over the cemetary across the way, which has a bunch of junkies fooling around in there, with a girl dancing naked for no apparent reason, leave that to Linnea Quigley, and so the smoke starts to re-animate the corpses in the cemetary.Overall, I give this one an A-, there were some minor flaws, for instance when the spoof takes a turn into the darkside, but ignore it. Other than that and the talking skeleton, it always bothered me how she could say her P's and B's with no lips.Co-Starring: Thom Matthews, Miguel Nunez, Jewel Sheperd, Mark Venturini, Linnea Quigley.",The Return of the Living Dead
180,mjsmjs-46362,Cult Classic Masterpiece,8,18 June 2017,"This film lands in an absolutely perfect spot somewhere in between horror, spoof, and dark comedy, not an easy task to pull off. It has just the right amount of each to make it perhaps one of the most entertaining and fun to watch films of the genre, one of the most influential, and arguably one of the best.It's well cast, the actors deliver solidly convincing performances of their respective characters, and the dialogue is good. The sets are well done and the cinematography is excellent. The special effects are great considering the era it was made and the budget used, and create some very memorable imagery that will stay with the viewer long after watching the film. The punk rock soundtrack and theme music go perfectly with the film and do a wonderful job of enhancing the overall mood and viewing experience.I suspect some of the negative reviews of the film were made by viewers who either don't like the genre to start with, or they had preconceived ideas of what the film should have been going into it. Since it doesn't land solidly in either the spoof or horror category, viewers expecting it to do so may be disappointed. The key to this film is to simply let it entertain you, it does a marvelous job of that. Those who point out the clichés in this movie fail to recognize that this is the film that actually started most of them in the first place.

186,aro-2,"""Scream"", for the ""living dead"" genre...",8,26 January 2000,"It all begins in a medical supply warehouse where Burt is training new recruit Freddy in the ways of running the business. Discussion eventually leads to Burt mentioning a few barrels being stored in the basement. According to Burt, they contain corpses that had at one time been reanimated. You see, ""Night Of The Living Dead"" was based on an actual event. Somehow a group of scientists accidentally created a gas that revives the dead. The military stored these corpses in cannisters and shipped them. Only problem is, they got shipped to the wrong place. Fortunately, these cannisters had an emergency phone number stenciled on them. Unfortunately, the owner of the warehouse never bothered to call it. Burt and Freddy decide to visit the basement and take a look. They end up puncturing one of the barrels, causing the body inside to melt, thereby releasing the gas. Well, this is a medical supply facility. What do you suppose they might be storing in that walk-in freezer upstairs? Oh, yes. That cadaver we were introduced to earlier.""Alien"" writer Dan O'Bannon makes his directing debut with this hilarious, violent sendup of zombie flicks. Beginning with the above mentioned, isolated situation, whose solution creates an even larger problem, the film progresses until the entire town is overwhelmed by walking corpses. O'Bannon takes any number of elements from Romero's series and gives them a twist. The zombies are no longer stumbling into walls. In fact, they appear to be rather intelligent. When a woman escapes by hiding in a locker, this particular zombie attaches the door handles to a miniature crane and proceeds to rip the doors off. They're also smart enough to figure out how to use a CB to acquire more food. These are picky corpses, too. They don't want just any piece of human flesh, they want brains.As stated previously, this is a parody. While it does contain all the violence requisite to a horror film of this sort, it focuses on comedy. Realistic, if underdeveloped, characters make the profanity-laden dialogue genuinely funny. Other situations, such as Trash(Linnea Quigley) giving a short essay on the worst way to die which gives way to a striptease(all this taking place in a cemetery), are good moments of black comedy. Nevertheless, a love of black comedy is not required to enjoy this film. There are many other moments to laugh at. The only thing that might turn off some viewers is the level of violence. It's never excessive, but a few well placed effects will have the more squeamish viewers glancing at the floor. On the other hand, some of the violence is quite amusing. You have to admit, watching two guys restrain a formerly dead body while the third hits it in the head with a pickaxe(which has no effect, I might add) is downright hilarious.All in all, whether you like horror of comedy, you're going to like this.

I'm fortunate enough to own a copy, but if you don't have one, tough!  When I think of all of the horror garbage that you CAN buy at any video store it puzzles me to no end why one of the greatest horror films ever made is basically not available.The first half of the film involves the employees of a medical supply warehouse and their ""little problem""- a canister of ""245tri-oxin"" leaks onto a cadaver causing it to come back to life.  The employees deal with this problem, but in turn cause a much bigger one- an army of rotted, brain eating zombies.  From there the movie escalates into an all out war between zombies and humans, and centers around the small group of punks and scientists who must escape the raging battle.  I LOVE the Romero trilogy, but honestly this is just as good.

202,nickmrkonja,Words can't describe how much I love this movie.,10,21 December 2020,"If Night of the Living Dead weren't such a perfect masterpiece of horror, Return of the Living Dead may have been my all-time favorite horror film. My two passions in this world are horror and punk rock, and this movie has both in spades. Night of the Living Dead was the first horror film I ever saw... I was 6 and it gave me the worst nightmares of my life that I still remember vividly to this day. But it also made me fall in love with horror movies.I saw Night for the first time in 92.. so it was right around the time that the zombie movie craze of the 70s and 80s died down, and about 10 years away from their second coming (obviously still going today). The 90s brought a terrible drought for quality horror movies, just a handful over the decade, especially zombie flicks. So I wasn't totally desensitized to the concept.So I gorged on the Romero trilogy for about a year (since I'm from Pittsburgh) until I finally went to the video store to see if there might be another movie made about zombies... HA! I had no idea of the zombie (movie) outbreak of the last 20 years but luckily, Return was the next one I picked up because the cover looked so cool. Again, it was love at first viewing.I will say that I completely HATE comedy-horror movies. They're trash. There may be one or two quality ones... But a horror movie with elements of comedy.. especially dark comedy.. is totally different. And that's exactly what Return is. It really is a twisted, bleak, and extremely dark movie, but it still has that subtle, indirect humor, the kind that made the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons so great. It really takes brilliant direction to have such a disturbing scene like Spider, Burt, and Ernie (see? perfect. hilarious, subtle, and indirect) listening to a torso describe the pain of feeling itself rot, but then Spider throwing in ""I'll bus' it in the damn head!"" a second later.The casting was excellent. James Karen definitely stole the show. He could crack you up just by the way he'd contort his face. Clu Gallagher and Don Kalfa were amazing actors in general, and the punks all dressed and acted pretty on point the way they did in the mid 80s. The soundtrack was a nice collection of 80s punk... The Cramps, TSOL, The Damned, 45 Grave, The Flesh Eaters. AND Dan O'Bannon (who wrote Alien) both directed and adapted the screenplay from a story written by John Russo and Russ Streiner (creators of the original Night).Bottom line, this was the perfect combination of elements. If you've ever read Russo's original novel for Return from 77 (a year before Dawn was released), you can see who really brought that dark, bleak sense of dread and horror to the original Night since none of the subsequent Romero movies had it. And even though the novel was totally rewritten for the film, Russo's fingerprints are still all over it because in my opinion, Return had that same bleak atmosphere of horror that Night had... way more than Dawn did.If you're still reading by now, thank you and I'm sorry for droning on.. it's just that these were both my first horror movies and also the first I loved, so I'm a fountain of useless information about all of them. Like any real Pittsburgher should be (eff the Steelers, go Living Dead!). If you've only seen Walking Dead, 28 Days Later, and World War Z, the 21st century stuff, at the risk of sounding like an old head, you REALLY need to see Night first and then Return. Night is my absolute favorite horror movie ever, and the best ever made. This is a close second. Better than Dawn I think, even though they're totally different styles, but I'd choose this if I had to pick. It's funny when it can be, but then it goes right back to twisted, dark horror right after. Much like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and the first two Evil Dead movies, it's very unique in this aspect... they're original, very well written, interesting stories, and both funny AND scary.WATCH THIS.",The Return of the Living Dead

The actors all hit there mark and played their parts with real enthusiasm. Most horror films of this type you find the characters being played as if the whole situation is a joke and well, brain hungry zombies are no joke! Although presenting this situation as a joke to an audience is another thing. This is one of the best horror/comedies of all time and a must own. It can easily be watched over and over again.

One could argue that we in fact see more of this film in modern zombie and horror flicks than we do of Romero's classics. Of course no one would dare discredit the father of the zombie film, and Night of the Living Dead (1968) will always be THE film that changed it all, but if you look at the modern zombie, they embody just as much of this film as they do Romero, if not more. Running Zombies and a humorous post-modern deconstruction of the zombie sub-genre similar to that of a more contemporary example in Cabin of the Woods (2011), this film sets about breaking nearly every rule Romero creates about the Zombie.

By chance the people who ran the movie theater didn't really care and I have to admit that I got really scared watching this awesome bunch of walking, rotting greasy corpses! From then on I watched this masterpiece so many times I can't even count them!Why do I like this film so much? Well, Return of The Living Dead is a 90-minute roller-coaster (no kidding!) driving fast through a rainy night. What I mean is that the rhythm never falls off and that the flick is both scary AND funny. Some scenes are really disturbing (e.g. the self-cremation scene or the zombie awakening in the cold room) and some other elements are nothing but pure laughing matter (you've got to like black humor, that's right, but I presume you do - otherwise you wouldn't be reading this!).

208,ttron2000,spectacular!,10,12 July 2012,"this is not only one of the best (if not the best!) zombie movies of all time, but it's one horror movie that throughout my childhood never got old and still doesn't to this day. part horror movie, part comedy, and all kinds of fun, this one never bores, even if the effects look dated. for this, like the golden zombie films of the immortal George Romero, relies on make up and mechanics rather than CGI and cheese. playing as if ""Night of the Living Dead"" was based on a true story, but in order to prevent lawsuits, the facts were changed around: a military chemical reanimates dead bodies, turning them into unstoppable zombies with a craving for human brains. all of this was contained with the zombies and the chemical stored in steel tanks, but these tanks were mistakenly sent to the wrong place, a medical supply warehouse in Kentucky, where the story opens. all is quiet and fine until two morons, frank and Freddy (james Karen and Thom Matthews), crack one of the tanks and release the chemical (as well as the tank's inhabitant). frank and Freddy inform their boss, Burt (Clu Gulager), who enlists the help of local mortician, Ernie (Don Calfa) to help cover up the mess. this makes things worse, spraying the chemical over the nearby graveyard and raising an endless swarm of nasty (and very hungry) dead people. these poor saps, along with a group of teenage punks, end up trapped inside the mortuary, barricading themselves inside with very little hope of escape. the formula is the same as most zombie films, but never has one been more fun. for the most part, this piece is a comedy, loaded with lots of foul language and nudity (thanks to punker babe Linnea Quigley), but the situation (zombies that can only be killed by being completely destroyed to nothing) and setting (an old, cemetery enclosed in thick trees and woods on a dark, rainy night) are most serious. the actors have fun, but are never cheesy. gulager's great as always, calfa (basically playing a Nazi in hiding) is awesome, but Karen and Matthews are the best, especially in the first half. as the two dumb bastards responsible for this nightmare, their interplay is both frantic and hilarious as they squabble over the next course of action. the movie has its share of gore (open skulls, pieces of brain, blood sprays, rotting bodies), so along with the comedy, it has a little bit of something for everybody. then there's the ending which basically shows the best solution for such a large type clusterf*#k. i don't expect everybody to like it, but most horror fans will love it and probably consider it an 80s classic. i know i do.",The Return of the Living Dead

I still need to get ahold of that Cramps song ""The Surfin Dead"" How about Linnea Quigley? Huh? Huh? I saw her in a recent scream queens special and she's hot as ever though a little weathered and apparently hanging out with some ding dong who handles props or something and hides in her bathroom while she's doing interviews. You'd do her, though. And so would I and all those old zombie guys in the movie are they fdoing her or eating her or maybe both. I don't know but I can't blame them.

This is not easily accomplished as I am a horror fan but yep this film did it. I don't think brains are anyone's favorite organ to view at least not mine. This is probably one of the intentions of this movie- to up the ante on night of the living dead. This film accomplishes this in several ways which I discovered years later when I actually sat through the whole thing. The zombie's in this series are fast, harder to get rid of and can work together to get you! This film is funny, scary and gross all at the same time- a weird but very effective combo. It is now one of my favorite horror movies and I think it will stand the test of time. Just a note, the second movie was OK, the third was bad and started to veer away from o'bannon's new zombie rules. I will review those movies as well.",The Return of the Living Dead

And let's talk about those punks, Miguel Nunez and Brian Peck are great as 2 hard rockin' dudes. Mark Venturini doesn't have much of a part, but man can he act! And who doesn't want to see the luscious Linnea Quigley in a cemetary strip scene (love that short, red hair, among other things). Anyway, this movie is great, funny, and most likely the only movie where you'll hear ""Do You Wanna Party"" by 45 Grave while zombies are attacking.

This was a rare horror gem, in a decade where horror had been reduced to garbage like Friday The 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street. Not to mention it managed to beat even the father of zombie films (George Romero) at the box office that year.

To say I was dissappointed would be an understatement. The gore is almost non-existant, and the viewer doesn't connect with the characters at all, I wanted them to die. Couple this with the gayest ending I have ever seen, and you have one bad movie. I don't recommend it, but if you're bored and have nothing else to do on a Saturday night, I say try it.

Penned by John Russo and Russ Streiner whom were heavily involved with Night. After being picked up, Alien scribe Dan O'Bannon was tapped to turn this story into a feature film, but decided he didn't want to tread on Romero's territory so he developed his own zombie mythos and brought to the masses an intelligent, fun and scary dead flick for horror fans to embrace and enjoy years and years to come.if you are a zombie fan, and love a little dark humor mixed in with your Zombie films then this film is a must see for all zombie fans.",The Return of the Living Dead

When I got done watching it I realized I just lost an hour and a half of my life. Then I got mad. First of all, the actors sucked. I thought they were just stupid no talented morons. Second there was the fact it was a slap in the face to the zombie master George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead) Zombies are supposed to die when they get their head or brain destroyed and in this they completely destroyed this zombie, cut his head off, caught him on fire and he still came back. Then there was the fact they could think and make decisions and talk. That was stupid. I said this to a friend once and he said it ignored the Romero classics because it had nothing to do with them. THEN WHY IS IT CALLED RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD??? It's just a cheap spin off to get some fast cash. As a horror movie wasn't scary at all, and as a comedy it wasn't funny at all.

We have one mishap after another, until we meet a group of punk rockers that happen to wanna party at the local graveyard. The occupants of the graveyard seem to wanna have some gory fun as well.

A cadaver in the basement of a warehouse has come to life and has been locked in a walk-in freezer. The guy who runs the warehouse and his two employees are trying to figure out how to deal with a dead man who's come back to life and is throwing a fit in their place of business. One of the guys asks what the people did in the movie ""Night of the Living Dead"", it being the most famous of all zombie flicks so the best point of reference. The guy says that in the movie the humans destroyed the zombies by destroying their brains. The guys slam a pick-ax through the zombie's head which pins him to the floor, but does not ""kill"" him. ""Well, it worked in the movie,"" one guy screams and the other guy replies, ""Well, it ain't working now!"" Sheer cinematic brilliance, if you ask me. Think about it, if zombies did start walking the Earth and attacking us, we would do the same thing. We'd reference a zombie movie simply for the sheer lack of anything else to look to. If a vampire attacked we'd look for some garlic and a stake, and not because we learned it in grammar school, but because we saw it in a movie. A lot of people thought ""Shaun of the Dead"" was such an original idea, a zombie comedy! News is, people have been making them for awhile, and this one's the best of the bunch. Clu Gulager's performance is wonderful, he's equal parts Jimmy Stewart and Clint Eastwood. He's got that ""everyman"" quality, but exudes the classic movie tough guy machismo when it's called for. I don't know what other actor could sport a ""Members only"" jacket for an entire film and still look cool. Don Calfa is also memorable as the bug-eyed mortician who really takes pride in his work. The soundtrack is great, featuring ""Surfing Dead"" by the cramps and some other eighties underground classics as well. There's good gore and even some frights, despite the comedic tone. The ending is classic horror movie all the way as well.

No doubt if that had been the case then it would have aged nowhere near as well.

When my friend suggested that we view the film at his house, I jumped at the idea as he lived in a detached Victorian villa which had been built just inside the perimeter fence of the grave yard.We waited until after dark, and we watched the film in his front room and whilst the plot was unravelling, we started talking about what we'd do if everything on the screen was really happening outside. After the movie, we dared each other to go out for a walk amongst the tombstones, but neither of us could summon the courage. To this day, some twenty years later, I still ask myself whether I should have taken him up on the dare, but I think the answer would still be a big 'no way'.The film is excellent, and is guaranteed to freak you out. There are some really original ideas that still seem quite brilliant even to this day. The best idea of the film centres upon the sense of isolation that surrounds the concept of being trapped in a siege situation. When the characters take refuge in the mortuary and then board themselves in, it is like ""Precinct 13"" but with zombies! There are some really good touches to look out for (the split-dogs is one that springs to mind).In many ways this is a better film than ""Night of The Living Dead"". There are more zombies for a start and the effects are state of the art 80's stuff. It is a brilliant touch for the film maker to indicate at the start of the film that the events are real. At the time I saw the movie, I actually believed that everything had really happened (well, I was only 15).I would recommend this film to any fan of the genre. Oh by the way, watch out for Trash's dance in the graveyard. Please note that all of my comments relate to Return Of The Living Dead (Part 1)and not to the second film in the series. I got mixed up between the two. I'm just that kind of guy!",The Return of the Living Dead
241,pullomeri-1,What a gas!,8,27 March 2006,"This was originally supposed to be a straight (if unofficial) sequel to Night of the Living Dead, but somewhere along the way it became one of the best comic horror films of the decade. The secret is that director O'Bannon never lets on that the material is supposed to be funny: at times the movie almost resembles a seriously intended flick that would up accidentally amusing. The opening scene sets the tone perfectly, as Uneeda Medical Supply worker Frank (James Karen) instructs new worker Freddy (Thom Mathews) about the tricks of the trade before showing him some sealed canisters in the warehouse basement. In these canisters, Frank says, are the very corpses whose rampage inspired Romeros first Living Dead film, along with a gas that can give revive them and other dead things. Through circumstances too involved to describe here, the gas winds up escaping (along with the corpse) from the canister and gets into a nearby graveyard, awakening an army of zombies. They terrorize not only Frank and Freddy, but their boss, Burt (Clu Gulager), weird mortician Ernie (Don Calfa) and bunch of Freddys punk friends who have decided to party in the graveyard.The resulting goings-on alternate between shockingly gory and hilariously funny, and the film is also notable for a couple of horror landmarks.In the first genre film set in Louisville, Kentucky, and it was the firs film bring Linnea Quiqlley to prominence.",The Return of the Living Dead

Over the years, I have grown to love this flick.
It is one of my all time favourite horror movies that really has stood the test of time.
With a razor sharp script full of pitch black humour, this movie is an entertaining romp from beginning to end.
With a stellar cast, mixed with seasoned professionals and some who were literally cast off the street, everyone gels perfectly.
The score.
The gore.
It is a true classic.",The Return of the Living Dead

245,menard_desiree,This has been my favourite zombie film since I was way too young to be watching! Lol,10,21 August 2020,This is probably one of my all time favourite horror films of all time.

Always will!!,The Return of the Living Dead
246,trek79,A favourite,10,3 August 2013,"This is up there as one of my favourite movies of all time. The idea of these zombies is second to none in any zombie movie I have seen. You have super zombies in the remake of Dawn of the Dead, and the infected in 28 Days Later, but even they are lacking in the range of qualities the zombies possess in this film.If you think about it; the are virtually indestructible, if you dismember them their pieces come after you, if you incinerate them the smoke poisons you and goes on to expose more corpses. They are intelligent; they seem a bit ditzy and have that impulsive single minded desire for brain, which can be exploited against them, but the living characters are not much different, so the zombies are on level footing anyway as they can speak and strategise. Then finally they are quite fast and strong, not super like the afore mentioned, but they are generally not slouches either.I love this film, I give it 10 from 10, its sequel is a little more disappointing but only for the fact that they find an effective way to stop the zombies with no real adverse effects.",The Return of the Living Dead
247,filmfan-15,I can't believe people liked this movie!,3,15 April 1999,"This movie was a complete rip off of the all-time great, ""Night of the Living Dead"".  There were no real great actors in it, and the parts were played like a cheap B movie.  The zombies were given too much intelligence, acting more like people than decayed zombies.  This movie was a complete waste of the money I spent to rent it.",The Return of the Living Dead
248,davis62,An affectionate spoof..,8,3 September 2000,"This movie is a very funny and affectionate spoof of the George Romero movies, made a decade or two earlier. It's not particularly ""gory"", in that the FX technologies at the time weren't that advanced. The movie rarely takes itself seriously, and is filled with obvious and probably intentional ""logic glitches"". (IE a long dead corpse with a fresh pink tongue? Or a skeleton with eyeballs?) The magic gas 2-4-5 Trioxin works on anything that used to be alive, not just humans. Look closely and you'll see a collection of pinned butterflies flapping their wings! And the cinematic classic, the Split Dog. There are plentiful one-liners (What's that noise?? It's dead people screamin'!!) and a cutting glance at contemporary fads, fashions and trends.Unlike the lame sequels, this is a comedy-horror with....""BRAAIINS!""",The Return of the Living Dead
249,cropduster35,One of the best horror films of all time!,10,27 March 2001,"""The Return of the Living Dead"" has held a special place in my heart for a very long time. This satirical take on Romero's classic (if you don't know which one, you shouldn't be reading this) is one of the greatest horror films ever made and is also one of the most respected. The direction by Dan O'Bannon, writer of ""Alien"" (also one of the greatest), is superb and Jules Brenner's cinematography is stunning for a film not shot in a widescreen aspect ratio (it was shot 1.37:1 full frame to save money). The scene with the rising of the zombies is best described as hauntingly beautiful yet chilling. The cast gives great performances and the special effects are astounding, as is Matt Clifford's rousing score. The nasty going-ons is highlighted by a powerful metal soundtrack featuring The Cramps and Billy Idol.The plot concerns some nasty chemical that has the ability to bring the dead back to life. When a barrel of the stuff is accidentally opened, all hell breaks loose: the cast is forced to do battle with scores of zombies (this time hungry for brains). Twists and turns abound as the cast is trapped at Ground Zero-the epicenter of the plague, if you will. All of the characters are likely even though they are mostly sleazy and corrupt. Linnea Quigley is great as Trash as is Clu Gulager as the corrupt warehouse owner. The zombies themselves are fun to watch; be warned, however, that they are not the usual slow, shuffling stiffs we've all come to love.All in all, ""The Return of the Living Dead"" is an amazing thrill ride that will remain in your mind long after it's over. Do yourself a favor and seek out this cult classic. You won't regret it!",The Return of the Living Dead

It's not OF THE JEDI nor OF THE KING but OF THE LIVING DEAD!This is the unofficial sequel to Night Of The Living Dead penned and directed by Dan O'bannon of Alien fame. This movie isn't really a sequel at all but its own zombie movie. The only thing it has in common with Night is the fact that this is a zombie movie and Living Dead is in the title. The Zombies in this movie can run, speak, and bite through skull to eat ""BRAINS!"" The soundtrack to this movie is also great. I love The Cramps. This is also one of those movies that are just uber-entertaining. It is good ol' fashion turn off you brain fun.",The Return of the Living Dead
251,White_Thunder,"Dead Scary, Dead Funny, Dead Good!!!",10,27 November 2009,"Without a shadow of a doubt the best zombie film out there, it's short and sharp! it has the right mix of horror and humour and quite simply characters to die for. The cast work great together and you can tell they're having a riot. The more you watch the film you'll always find something new. The zombies are amazing and actually run (this was probably the first zombie film to have them running). The soundtrack is also great with a load of 1980's punk songs too, the only problem with the DVD is that the soundtrack has been tampered with along with the zombie's voices :-( the old VHS is better apart from the grainy picture.

Good fun...I have this DVD in my collection.It was one of the first titles I purchased for the new format.I've always loved this movie,with it's creepy feel ,and fun soundtrack.The movie delivers laughs,as well as chills.I have always loved the way the characters behave in this film.They are scared to pieces.How is someone supposed to react to the ""living dead"" anyway?

253,jcopple-79759,Fan of horror and comedy combination,10,24 November 2018,This horror movie had me afraid of going to or near a local cemetery when I first seen this movie at the tender age of 6 years old but as time grew on I started loving horror movies and this one in particular because I grew in the town where some of the original Night of the living dead was filmed and there was a cemetery up the road from where I lived that gave me the chills when I first seen this movie as a young kid. I love this movie for three different reasons. 1 the gore and special effects is top notch given that it was filmed in the 1980s for the quality of special effects at that time was a little cheesy. 2 the acting was superb with no overdramatic or overall acting. 3 Horror and comedy mix very well and you gotta love the dialogue in this horror. And I my personal favorite scene where Linea Quigley aka Trash gets naked and does a striptease.,The Return of the Living Dead

Hell of a movie!",The Return of the Living Dead
255,Video_God,This was truly amazing!,8,26 April 2001,"This movie is truly amazing. I have always wanted to see a movie where the zombies or creatures of the dead were not stiff, and slow! These were not! They moved fast, killed quick, and could talk! They say this movie is true! What do you think? Did this really happen?The makeup effects were amazing espescially for 1985! The acting is very over dramatized, but hey its a good old horror movie to watch just to have fun.Be warned, this movie is truly great, but dont go into it expecting to be scared to death, go into it with the Evil Dead attitude and i assure you that you'll love it!",The Return of the Living Dead
256,revraven,Excellent mesh of comedy and horror,10,24 November 2002,"Return is much like Evil Dead 2 in it's sense of purpose in both comedy and horror. The first half hour of the film is easily seen as a comedy, then things take a more serious turn once the zombies start showing up. The actors, most notably Clu Gulager (and occasionally Jewel Shepard) provide some solid comedic delivery while still showing the horror of being up against Return ZombiesT. Francis Haines' score is perfect and haunting, providing the right background element for the scenes it's used in, O'Bannon's direction works wonderfully (especially the ""following the smoke"" scenes), and lastly..the ending is one of the best in movie history.

Went back on Wednesday with a friend. Then back again on Friday with 5 more. Horror/comedy/gorefest which set the bar long before it's less subtle ""Scary Movie"" counterparts. Call it a highbrow lowbrow black comedy with enough gore for any slaher fan. Running, thinking, wisecracking zombies chase a group made up of punk rockers, middle aged working men, and any other living creature happening by. I find myself laughing out loud still, 21 years later, after probably over 100 viewings. Definitely has my favorite ending of all living dead films. You will find some lines stay in your head long after watching. Since the music has changed on the DVD version (at least in the states)I would also recommend a copy of the original soundtrack, with punk greats such as TSOL and Roky Erikson.",The Return of the Living Dead

260,supermutantvirus,Brainless with a heart,9,12 November 2013,"Likable characters take believable actions after some typical army screw up escalates with a hunger.The story unfolds somewhat logically but deliciously absurd. All involved are in a way bored with life and irony demands this to change. It does so gloriously!You will learn to love Bert and his fellow condemned, Suicide with his group of dimwitted rascals, Ernie with his passion for the dead and of course Colonel Glover, who loves his job more than his spouses lamb chops. But that is not all, the atmosphere is unsettling, chilling and in some shots brilliantly eerie. It is also hilarious!There is a lot of talent at work here and accompanied by some great 80's sounds it is a great ride from start to finish.

261,zombieman132002,Best Horror film.,10,11 September 2002,"Just so you know, Return of the Living Dead is not a sequel to Night of the Living Dead, although it may appear to be. It follows the efforts of the workers at a medical supplier, a mortician, and some punks as they fend off brain hungry zombies. This movie has a great soundtrack, good horror, good comedy, and the punks are the most diverse group of people I have seen in any movie. I must say Return of the Living Dead probably, along with Dawn of the Dead, is the best zombie film ever made. It might even be one of the best horror films ever. The whole cast superb. Clu Gulager as Burt, the take charge owner, James Karen as Frank, the whiny factory worker who's slowly turning into one of the dead. The entire cast of punks is good, despite their lacking of experience and very young age. Don Calfa also shines as the mortician across the street.

263,svmpsguy,Better than Romero,9,16 October 2009,"Dawn of the dead tried dark humor with a mall zombie pie-in-the face. Oh ha ha... what a riot. Not. This movie supercharges the zombie genre with some jolting humor throughout.You have to like a movie that features a re-animated split dog in a medical supply house. I have to give credit where it due: this movie has better zombies than the prior movies. Tarman has to be the coolest zombie of all time. I remember the theater audience screaming and gasping when he pops out for the first time.This movie also was the first to amp up zombies. Anything and everything dead was re-animated by a toxic chemical (trioxin, which is bad stuff) from an old Army Corps of engineers drum. They are also fast and posses some basic intelligence. The zombies here were by far more menacing than in other movies because the can sprint after you, and will do so even if they are missing legs. The look of the zombies is terrific...bones with any meat on them could re-animate and pose a problem.The two principal leads have an excellent chemistry and play for good (dark) laughs along the way. This film is fully aware of a lot of zombie cliché's and does a great job of opening up the world of the undead past simple lumbering, dumb and slow zombies. This movie gives zombies a reason for what they do, which is eat the brains of the living.I enjoyed the way this movie balances tension, action and humor. It's very underrated, but a total blast for fans of the genre. You will also note that the final solution (which is an epic fail) is foreshadowed in an earlier scene. That toxic chemical is bad stuff that doesn't go away. Watch this on Halloween, you need to see tar man on a big screen with the volume cranked up.",The Return of the Living Dead
264,wbrown24,Horrifically Funny!,7,10 September 2005,"This flick is definitely worth seeing at least once. It's great for a few laughs and doesn't fail to hold the viewer's attention for a moment. I believe it serves the original justice. Keep in mind that I developed this opinion based on viewing the movie shortly after it was released in 1985 when I was seven years old. Due to the graphic content I wouldn't advise or recommend allowing your seven year old viewing this movie. However, even an adult seeing this movie for the first time may also catch themselves peeking through a couple fingers from time to time. If you're a big fan of vintage horror flicks and and haven't seen this classic yet, you're missing out. In addition, you may get more out of Return of the Living Dead if you watch the originals; Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead & Day of the Dead. Enjoy!",The Return of the Living Dead
265,JustWatching7,Pretty funny 80s horror,8,10 October 2017,"This film is hilarious on how to play with the expectations of the zombie genre. Also, the physical actor and the effects for the Tarman are unbelievable. The acting in the film are enjoyably cheesy and the characters are enjoyable to hang out with, who would've thought that a group of punks could be friends with cheery, normally dressed girl. It's over the top and and the tropes of each character are taken to the extreme, which is great. The only flaw I seem to remember from the film (it's been awhile) was only one scene that I felt was unnecessary and went on longer than it needed to.

The Return of the living dead is an original zombie movie; the zombies are fast, talk, plan attacks and do not die by any of the classic zombie killing methods way we all know and have seen before. This is a fun horror-comedy, plain and simple, not meant to be taken seriously. The acting is over the top and the story is hilarious.The return of the living dead is one of those horror films that keeps you sucked in until the end; It does not have any dull moments and is pretty darn (intentionally) funny.

This movie does not fail to deliver on sheer entertainment delight. The low budget effects are part of the charm. The strength of the film comes from the incredible interaction among the actors. The situations they find themselves in are over the top, but the solutions they come up with to deal with them are what makes the movie. Watching the warehouse supervisor come completely unhinged after he discovers dead things coming to life was pure joy. Especially as he momentarily regains his composure as he calls his boss to explain that they have 'a situation' at the warehouse. I've watched this movie several times over the past 20 years and watching it last night, forced me into convulsive laughter. Tears were streaming down my face as I tried to catch my breath.

It never dragged, zipping you from one moment of dread to another and when it got too gory or intense, O'Bannon brought in the laughs. Not slapstick but genuine, over-the-top gags. Whether it be a hungry zombie asking to ""send more cops"" as if he was ordering pizza or the bumbling warehouse employees who, after accidentally releasing a toxic gas that re-animates corpses, find that killing zombies by destroying the brains doesn't work. When they finally exclaim ""WELL IT WORKED IN THE MOVIES!"" you know the rules have been thrown out the window.The film works on so many levels of gore and humor and the fact that it makes fun of itself and Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" come off as more self-aware than Wes Craven's ""Scream"" films of the 90's.The film took it's chances and could've p***ed off fans of Romero's original by actually referring to that movie within the first few minutes, saying it was all fictional and that ""what really happened was..."" well you get the idea. In fact, O' Bannon tried as hard as possible to make his film as different from Romero's. You see, O' Bannon's zombies could RUN after you, could think and plan ways to get at you, they could TALK to you and tell you what part they wanted to eat from you......""BRAINS!""The film was shot on a $4 million dollar budget and had it's problems with make-up and FX but the wonderful, brisk editing and the gloomy lighting more than covered up it's technical flaws. You'd be hard pressed to find any obvious goofs.The film's punk rock soundtrack is excellent. Dare I say ""goth punk""? Sure it fit in with the punk characters that got stuck in the horror but the tone of the songs fit in so well with the movie.The cast was superb, all somehow finding the perfect way to play their parts. There isn't a single 'off' performance. Frank's over-the-top ""freaking out"", Burt's calm ""this is what we're gonna do"" attitude and Freddy's realization of what's happening to his body and mind all showcase the talent that made the film work.When one of our heroes (who's been zombiefied) commits suicide by burning himself ""alive"" in the crematorium....it's not horrific but truly sad. Actor James Karen embodied 'Frank' with such an ""every guy"" quality, you couldn't help but feel for him.Thom Mathews played ""Freddy"". A new level was added to the zombie genre. We see a young man, full of life with lots of partying left to do, slowly get snuffed out. He was exposed to the gas you see and he's slowly dying.....yet already dead. He's conscious while feeling rigor mortis setting in.....and he describes every pain to you. It's unsettling.Clu Gulager plays the warehouse owner 'Burt' (his best friend who owns the funeral home next door? Ernie. Nope, not kidding!) who seemingly dead pans throughout the entire film. While the entire film is going crazy, he is the constant throughout and you feel that if you were in the same situation, you'd want him there helping to make crucial decisions.Linnea Quigley, the ""B-movie scream Queen"" plays 'Trash'. Her infamous, FULL FRONTAL strip tease has left many of my fellow 20-something's with fond memories of their childhood.This film parodied it's sub-genre of horror YEARS before the crap that was the ""Scream"" trilogy. It also managed to be FAR scarier than Wes Craven's poor attempts which basically amounted to a ""Boo!"" a 9 year old attempts on Halloween.Dan O'Bannon, the film's writer/director (primarily responsible for the classic ""Alien"") created a film that, in every way, perfectly blended horror and humor. I'm not saying it's the first, I'm saying it's the first at *doing it right.*The film was released in 1985 and went head-to-head with George Romero's ""Day of the Dead"". ""Return"" not only got better critical reviews but bested ""George the King"" at the box office and Romero is considered the best at this type of film. Wrong.Compare such boring trite with O'Bannon's work and the superior *film* shines through. O'Bannon saw the genre in a way most could not. Treat it's subject with respect yet realize, this is incredibly silly.O'Bannon's script is self-aware yet understands it's fictional world is very real. We get the humor, the film's characters aren't so lucky.The film goes the opposite of what you'd expect in such a subtle way. The hapless humans are caged in places normally associated with the dead (a funeral home, a medical supply warehouse) whereas the dead are free to roam around in the land of the living. Subtle.This is NOT a ""dumb"" film at all (as some uneducated people might mistake ""zombie"" films for.) It's an ironic, horrific, campy and witty take on a classic horror genre. A film I can watch over and over again.This classic film will FINALLY be released on DVD in America by MGM Home Video on August 27th, 2002.",The Return of the Living Dead
279,reucorp-1,One of the Best!!,10,23 October 2002,"I'd have to say in all honesty that this is one of my favorite Horror movies of all time. It may be hard to believe, because of the cheesy acting. But this is one of the only movies that made me scared after the film. It got into my brain and the more I thought about the movie the more scared I got. Granted I was only ten years old at the time. Sorry to ruin the end if you haven't seen, but not being able to kill the zombies freaked me out. I don't know if anyone felt the same.",The Return of the Living Dead
280,coryallenrulz,One of the best Zombie movies ever!!!!,10,7 October 2010,"There back from the grave and ready to Party!!! Filled with great Special Effects and a great soundtrack ""Return of the Living Dead"" stands out a one the best 1980s Horror films ever.Like it said above the Special Efx were especially on the Tarman zombie. Allan Trautman who portrayed Tarman had the right movement as if he was going to fall to pieces.And the cast of the film.Another thing that makes this movie stand out.With great actors like Clu Gulager,James Karen,Don Calfa.And the younger cast of Thom Matthews,Miguel Nunez Jr.,Linnea Quigley and the rest.Who I believe all of them gave performances of a lifetime.Dan O'Bannon who made the film what it was showed that he was a talented writer and director.The setting of the film was fantastic.The sets were believable.And also gave the movie a great vibe.This film is as original as it can get.When I was younger and seen it on VHS for the 1st time it actually did terrify me. But I grew into it.And the artwork for the film is great So many great things can be said about this movie.Why couldn't Return of the Living Dead 3,4,and 5 be as good as this.Not a bad question Burt",The Return of the Living Dead
281,Lars951,Genius low budget horror flick!,10,11 June 2004,"When I first saw this movie, I was 11 years old, and I didn't sleep well for six months. It was years before I stopped sizing up buildings for quick board-up jobs. Now that I'm almost 30, I can appreciate this movie for its humor and QUOTABILITY. The dialogue just crackles, and so does Linnea Quigley. Has anyone ever looked so good? Bottom line, I've never seen a movie switch gears like this one between horror and comedy without compromising ... except this one.I just wish there were decent sequels. Part II was a pure laffer, and the laughs weren't there. Part III didn't have ANY laughs, and it didn't really stick with the vibe. Plus, the TARMAN was all wrong. So stick with the original, ROTLD.",The Return of the Living Dead
282,JimmyLoneWolf,Influential Cult Classic!!,8,20 July 2004,"I saw this film when I was around 9 or 10, and I remember loving it back then. Unfortunately, time has not been kind to most of the movies I enjoyed during my youth. Imagine my surprise when I realized that not only was Return of the Living Dead every bit as much fun as when I first saw it, its actually improved!!First off, this is NOT a serious horror film. It is meant to be viewed as a comedy. Period. Once this perspective is taken, the horror elements are subtly introduced until, towards the end, we almost begin to feel a sense of disgust with ourselves for laughing at these people. I say ALMOST because a few silly decisions here and there (it would have been nice if the movie hadn't ended with recycled footage) turn what could have been the finest, and most disturbing, horror-comedy EVER MADE into a merely excellent one.Honestly, I challenge anyone to find a ""horror-comedy"" that delivers laughs, gore, some genuine scares, and combines it with what can only be called the finest acting I've ever seen in a horror-comedy (much less one from the 80's!). James Karen, Clu Gulager, and Don Calfa absolutely STEAL this movie with their sidesplitting hysterics. Listen to the lines, note the deliveries. These guys are pros! Anyone who could THINK to call their acting ""wooden"" clearly knows nothing about the traps horror-comedies often fall into. Personally, I was thinking of the OD scene from Pulp Fiction the entire time. The absurdity mixed with tension was eerily similar. Tarantino (an admitted zombie-movie fan) must SURELY have seen this movie upon its initial release. Gulager in particular is just plain brilliant here, he's like a burned out shop teacher fighting zombies!! This film is a hidden treasure in a genre all too often plagued by mediocrity.",The Return of the Living Dead
283,daddydanzombiegoose,Too good to get noticed.,10,9 May 2020,"A simple plot. fairly large cast that gets introduced quickly while still flushing out each character. horror. and finally, focused! all that and the movie still gets overlooked. this movie works because despite having a large cast for horror, there are NO SIDE QUESTS!! the events flow naturally, and all the characters hae the same goal. survive. no drama between characters. no plotting against each other, or turning on each other. just people trying to survive the horror they are in . these ""zombies"" are dangerous. they can run, they can think, and talk like you and i, they cannot be killed, and because they are in permanent pain, they will never stop hunting you. these ""zombies"" are almost too dangerous to be on film. you really do stand little chance against them, which is why it's such a hard movie for most people to respect. because humans can't remember how pain feels, they can't relate to these zombies level of distress. they're not monsters by choice. they hurt. they didn't ask to be reanimated. overall, this film brought new things to the zombie genre, and is structured amazingly well. characters choices make sense, and lead the story forward instead of the plot leading the actions. even though it's not non-stop action, it never slows down or feel boring. each scene leads to the next naturally. just like a good movie should.",The Return of the Living Dead
284,hay_123,best horror/comedy film to ever watch,10,30 September 2005,this is the best zombie film i have ever watched. it has everything you need in a film the horror and the humour in it. i remember one Saturday night a while back i was flicking through on sky and came across this film not knowing much about it like it was a horror/comedy zombie film i thought it was just a normal horror film then i came across the humour and i loved watching every last minute of this film.i think that the actors suited there characters very well and made them believable and how they all acted differently in the film for different things were fun to watch.this film is worth watching even to buy it.,The Return of the Living Dead
285,mcampbell-165-838229,Thoroughly entertaining and one of my favorite films,10,22 April 2015,"Combination of horror, comedy and great acting make this one of my favorite films of all time. A few famous (or at least recognizable) actors certainly helped the acting but the unknown ones are good too. I like that they didn't have a bunch of dumb girls being chased around. There is never a slow moment in this film, like riding a roller coaster. It tells a great story. It isn't too gory but gory enough. The special effects, especially the ""dead"" talking and moving around, are great and very realistic. You definitely have to see the second Return of the Living Dead as it continues with some of the original characters and is also a great film. The third installment was a bust but viewable. I highly recommend this fun film.",The Return of the Living Dead
286,kimberlylperry,Not All 10 star movies have a high production quality.,10,9 September 2019,This is the first zombie movie I ever watched. It embodies 80's cheese that but in the most entertaining dumb way. Please don't go your life without seeing it at least once!,The Return of the Living Dead
287,princessbaphandthemonsters,"The most important, innovative and influential film in the genre.",10,23 October 2016,"This is the most innovative, and arguably the best film in the genre. A perfect mix of camp, wit, style and straight up horror.This was the first movie to have zombies crave brains, and to have them be cunning and fast. Not to mention some of the most amazing and memorable scenes ever committed to celluloid. Every modern zombie film owes a tip of the hat to this cinematic masterpiece that single-handedly changed the genre. It is probably the most important and influential zombie flick of all time. I cannot believe this gem is so overlooked. If you have not seen this film do yourself a huge favour and watch it asap.",The Return of the Living Dead
288,donnymillington-76553,Not My Type of Horror Movie,5,24 November 2018,Has a very weak storyline and bad acting. Music was terrible they should not have teenage music in a horror movie it's stupid.,The Return of the Living Dead
289,riverrider-52086,Gore galore!,9,29 September 2020,"I found this film to be compelling, although shallow and pedantic. 9/10 for the terrific practical effects and copious amount of blood, guts, and cringeworthy situations.",The Return of the Living Dead
290,pizamyfav,Great movie!!,10,14 February 2006,"I think that this movie was one of best zombie films. I say because it takes a different view on the zombies films. It has humor, which is good, and has the classics, gore and horror. If you like zombie films, you'd like this one. The cast is good, and proof that the government is up to something. This film shows what would happen if something like that did happen. I think I would act like cast in the movie. I mean, he dead just don't come to life very often. Since there are remake of the other zombie films, there should be a remake of this movie. I have the DVD and it's nice to get the commentary and making of. It also has sketches what the zombies would look like. Plus, a storyboard for the film. I wish there would be more stuff on the DVD like deleted scenes and things like that. But, in general I still think it's a ten on the scale. I really recommend you see this movie because it explains a lot. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. Well one more thing, I guess. I love this movie!!",The Return of the Living Dead
