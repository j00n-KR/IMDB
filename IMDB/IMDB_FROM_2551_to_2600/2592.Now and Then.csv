0,SnoopyStyle,Female equivalent of 'Stand By Me',7,15 March 2014,"Samantha (Demi Moore) is called home to Shelby, Indianna for her childhood friend Chrissy (Rita Wilson)'s coming childbirth. She recalls her childhood in the summer of 1970 in the new subdivision Gaslight Addition. The four friends Roberta (Christina Ricci), Teeny (Thora Birch), Samantha (Gaby Hoffmann), and Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore) try to earn enough money for a tree house. One night, they play séance at Dear Johnny's grave at the cemetery and lightning strikes. They go off to discover the story behind Dear Johnny while Wormer brothers continue to hound them.There is a definite 'Stand By Me' feel to it. It's the female equivalent. The obvious question is if the adult version is compelling enough and do the two versions fit together. I can certainly do without the adult version. Rosie O'Donnell doesn't really fit as an adult Christina Ricci. It would have been much better to limit the adult storyline like 'Stand By Me'. Although, it's only about 20 minutes of screen time at the start and the end of the movie.",Now and Then
1,classicsoncall,"""I say we make a pact. Here and now.""",8,23 July 2018,"Enough reviewers here on IMDb have made a comparison of this film to ""Stand By Me"" that for me to mention it, it would be redundant. Nevertheless, the story did have a Stephen King vibe to it for a number of other reasons. It's a small town coming of age story told in flashback, with the character of Samantha (Demi Moore) narrating her experiences in the past and present with her closest childhood friends. The King novel ""It"", admittedly a horror story, possibly serves as a better comparison to ""Now and Then"" in as much as both have a cast of characters who have made a pact to reassemble as adults if any one of them needs help for a stressful situation. If that weren't enough, the storm drain scene had me dreading some demonic clown villain reaching out and grabbing Samantha to pull her under, until I realized that as the narrator, she would have to have survived that awful experience in order to tell the tale. Though on the surface the picture is positioned as one for women and young girls, I think there's some value in applying a more global perspective to the idea of nurturing friendship and loyalty throughout one's lifetime with those we grew up with. The four teen girls in the picture stuck together through thick and thin, searching for the truth about their home town and it's past secrets in a way that helped them grow as individuals. Realizing that not everything can be perfect in one's life is an important lesson to learn, and having a support system to help one grow through those rough patches is a valuable memory one can look back on as the years roll by.I liked the way the picture weaved the Crazy Pete/Dear Johnny subtext into the story, and how it helped Samantha come to grips with the father that abandoned her family. That dynamic further reinforced an idea offered by the returning Vietnam vet (Brendan Fraser), who's best advice to the girls had particular resonance in hindsight - ""You can believe in yourself, if you're lucky.""",Now and Then
2,grantss,Had potential but let down by mediocre plot and terrible (adult) casting,4,24 June 2020,"Four childhood friends, now in their thirties, are having a reunion. Their lives have gone separate and very different ways. Together again they reminisce about their younger years, especially the eventful period when they were 12 years old.Not an original idea: adults looking back on their childhood, reminiscing and considering their current lives. The Big Chill did it fairly well in 1983 and the nostalgia aspect has been covered many times, with great success. Still, Now and Then had a fair bit of potential.Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to that potential. You can divide the movie into parts: the child years and the adult years. Easily the better part is the younger one, as it has the more interesting plot and better performances. Not that the plot is brilliant but at least it keeps moving and does touch on themes of growing up and learning about life. The kids are great in their roles and it's not surprising that three of the four girls - Christina Ricci, Thora Birch and Gaby Hoffmann - went on to become stars.On the other hand, there's the adult part. The casting is an immediate turn-off, with actresses chosen because for their audience-pulling power rather than because they suited the roles. Christina Ricci's character grows up to be a doctor, played by Rosie O'Donnell. The doctor part was credible, the Rosie O'Donnell part not. She is so very wrong for the role. Demi Moore is also far from ideal in her role. Melanie Griffith essentially plays herself...and still seems wooden. Rita Wilson is annoying in her role.All in all the four adult stars lack the substance or finesse for such dramatic, sensitive and sentimental roles. Much of their acting is hammy plus they are not helped by their characters being drawn so one-dimensionally and the plot being decidedly lacklustre.A better movie would have involved ditching the adult section altogether and just expanding the younger section to cover more childhood experiences and the ups and downs of growing up. A female version of Stand By Me, if you will.",Now and Then
3,whpratt1,Very Down to Earth Film,10,13 November 2005,"Missed viewing this film in 1995 and was able to enjoy viewing all the great actors in the film and the wonderful portrayal of young girls growing into a very warm and loving relationship. Rosie O'Donnell, (Dr. Roberta Martin), played an excellent role as a young girl who had a very bad habit from childhood of eating food all day long, non-spot. Melanie Griffith, (Tina,'Teeny' Tercell) was a very charming gal who desired to become a great sexy movie star and arrived at the gals reunion with a stretch limo and driver. Demi Moore,(Samantha Albertson), played a very troubled young gal, who seemed to be lacking in love and the full meaning of life. This film showed very clearly how young gals confront young boys and in one scene in the old swimming hole of Summer, the gals stole the boys underwear and left them stark naked, except for a few towels the young boys were able to cover up with. Enjoy!",Now and Then
4,KineticSeoul,Can be a nostalgic flick for girls,6,18 March 2012,"Watching this reminded me of the Korean movie ""Sunny"" although this came out first. Well it wouldn't be a shock if the director of ""Sunny"" was influenced by this movie. The dialogue however didn't seem as natural sometimes and seemed like watching some southern novel that isn't really down to earth. It just didn't seem like what a group of women would be saying to each other, but than again the story switches back from the 70's to 90's when it comes to the characters. The dialogue just seemed too safe to be natural despite the sexual stuff and it's a girly movie. Since the 4 main character are 4 girls in the 70's and women in the 90's. Anyways the story is about 4 women getting together after spending there childhood together and reminisce of the past and adventures they had together. Although most of it takes place during a summer. Now I am not a fan of Rosie O'Donnell, to be honest I think she is irritating to watch sometimes. Her character is like the main character or leader of the pack and I thought it was ridiculous her younger version would be played by Christina Ricci. Not that I am a fan of Ricci either, but the comparison is too big to the point you can get confused who is who sometimes when it comes to the younger version with the older version or visa versa. So yeah I don't know if Rosie picked her younger version but it's just absurd. Overall this is a touching movie that most girls and maybe some boys will probably enjoy watching and parents will probably enjoy it as well. It really does give off a nostalgic feel because of the friendship, even if you didn't go through the same things the girls did in the movie. I give this movie a 6.8 because the development of the characters aren't done all that great and somethings are not explained and not for good reasons. Some say this is a female version of ""Stand By Me"" and I agree to certain extent.6.8/10",Now and Then
5,GOWBTW,Nostalgic and highly entertaining!,10,27 December 2005,"Very enlightening, very moving, and always a gem, ""Now and Then"" is one movie I can really enjoy. A great all-star cast, a superb plot, and a storyline one must never forget. Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, and Rita Wilson play the best friends ""Now"". Christina Ricci, Gaby Hoffman, Thora Birch, and Ashleigh Aston Moore play the best friends ""Then"". Friends after 20 years? Anything can happen. This movie is also great for Ricci, playing the highly insecure Roberta, the boys watching will have dreams about her when they see her shirtless. AHEM! Have respect please, this scene will turn teenage boys into voyeurs if they see this scene too many times. Then there's the part where ""The Wormers"" get their clothes stolen from the girls while they're skinny dipping. BACK AT YA, BOYS! The girls score! The rest of the movie you'll have to find out yourself, because this movie is too good for explanation, and the outcome is really heart warming. Look for all the things nostalgic; the music, the food, the games, and the fun this movie brings to you. Watch it! 5 stars!",Now and Then

7,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship,10,27 November 2005,"NOW AND THEN, in my opinion, is a very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship. If you ask me, it makes you and your friends stop and evaluate your friendship. I know it certainly made me stop and evaluate my friendship with my really close friends. All in all, this was a very good movie. In conclusion, if you enjoy buddy movies, and you haven't seen this very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship, I highly recommend it! You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. If you miss it, I guarantee you you'll regret it.",Now and Then
8,hu675,Charming if familiar coming of age tale is helped by good performances by the young female cast.,8,15 February 2007,"Four long time friends (Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melaine Griffen and Rita Wilson) are reunited, since they didn't seen each other in years. Once these friends decide to talk about their past. They talk about the best summer they ever had as Kids (Gaby Hoffman, Christina Ricci, Thora Birch and Ashleigh Aston Moore) and the difficulties they had growning up.Directed by Leslie Linka Glatter made an familiar, coming of age dramatic comedy. Which some might say this is the female version of ""Stand by Me"" but towed down version of it. Good performances highlights this, especially from the young cast. There's also a fine 1970's soundtrack adds to the enjoyment of the movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an lively Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only features are the original theatrical trailer and cast & crew information. This film was an modest hit at the box office. The movie is entertaining, especially for the pre-teen girls. Adults will likely relish this picture as well. Demi Moore is also one of the producers of this film. Brandan Fraser appears unbilled. (*** 1/2 out of *****).",Now and Then
9,gcd70,Not incredibly memorable,4,18 March 2008,"Would be ""Stand by Me"" for the girls, about growing up and making lasting friendships. The plot from I. Marlene King (a semi-autobiographical piece) has little substance and never really manages to captivate, reducing the target audience to teen girls twelve to sixteen years of age.Director Lesli Linka Glatter's film is almost entirely about ""Then"" and rarely covers ""Now"". Top line stars Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith and Rosie O'Donnel are wasted completely, playing less than a handful of paltry scenes. Whatever Miss Glatter was trying to create, she fails to make ""Now and Then"" into anything incredibly memorable.All pic. contains is a few light hearted adventures of four girls' discovery that they are on the verge of womanhood during the summer of 1970. Christina Ricci, Gaby Hoffman, Thora Birch and Ashleigh Aston Moore (the girls in question) do a reasonable job, but stars Hoffman and Ricci need to be challenged with meatier roles. Average film over all.Saturday, March 30, 1996 - Knox District Centre",Now and Then
10,caspian1978,A Coming of Age / Kid Film,3,4 August 2004,"With a giant cast including: Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore, Thora Birch, Rosie O'Donnell, and Christina Ricci, Now and Then is a surprise of a film. It is your typical coming of age drama / comedy for a kid audience. Still, with the number of well known actors, the movie is held higher than many other films of its genre. Although this film has never made it to any top 10 lists, the story and the acting is decent enough for the movie to be ""rent-able."" Grossing more than most comedies that year, Now and Then took in almost 30 million dollars in US markets alone. This movie was marked with two strong points. The cast carried the movie, and the age range of its audience members was girls between the ages of 10 and 15. Your story is somewhat typical for a coming of age story about a group of girls who have finally grown up and become women. Nothing terrific, but the movie has its moments and that's not bad.",Now and Then
11,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Girly version of Stand By Me?,7,11 January 2015,"Now and Then is as if Stand By Me (1986) and The Babysitter's Club (1995) were thrown together in a blender. It has fairly decent acting (Rosie O'Donnell and Walter Sparrow give excellent performances) and a pretty good soundtrack. Set in the nostalgic era of Super-8, modern suburbs and kids still frequently going outside, 1970, Now and Then is the story of four adult women going down memory lane in the Nineties and talking about their memorable summer as children. As kids they were all dealing with their own issues: Roberta was obsessed with death and ""playing dead"" after her mother was killed, Chrissy has no idea what sex is and feels immature compared to her friends, Teeny is a stuck-up only child who seems to know too much and Samantha's father has run off; her parents are getting a divorce. Their summer goal is to save up enough money for a large treehouse, but they get sidetracked when ghosts, family matters and their own growing up all interfere.Now And Then was a pretty good movie but definitely not original, it's a girly version of Stand By Me and mimics nearly every aspect of it. Christina Ricci was in it as the childhood Roberta, and she's a really great actress, no doubt about it, but she was in so many similar roles during the 1990's (The Addams Family, The Ice Storm, Mermaids, etc.) that she's overused and not very effective once you've already seen her in a million other things. Just like Dakota and Elle Fanning and Chloe Grace Moretz are overused way too much in the 21st century, Christina Ricci was in their place during the Nineties. She does a good acting job but it's just not convincing when she's been in so many other movies like Now and Then.The plot was very childish (yeah, I know it's about kids), but childish that it makes the characters acting like eight-year-olds rather than their supposed ages in the story. Still, the cast choice as adults was amazing, they look very much as you would picture the characters to be as grown-ups. Rosie O' Donnell looks exactly like an older Christina Ricci and so on.Now and Then isn't bad, it's a typical nostalgia movie. It isn't as good as Running With Scissors (2006) or The Ice Storm (1997) but it manages to keep you watching, so you've got to give it credit for that.",Now and Then
12,Analog_Devotee,"A great coming of age film, enjoyable for adults and kids alike.",8,4 March 2020,"This story reminds me of Stephen King's novel IT a lot, except it's much more kid friendly. That doesn't mean this film is constantly holding back punches, however. It can be fun, sad, gritty, and even spooky at times.But most of all, this film reeks of nostalgia. Even if you didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's, you'll feel nostalgia for a time you never lived in. And when the adult scenes hit between the kid scenes, especially toward the end, you'll find yourself thinking of old friends from your childhood, curious as to what those old rascals are up to.Track this one down. It's kept a cult-following over the years for a reason.",Now and Then
13,Ruskington,Contrived nostalgia,4,23 September 2020,"Despite being a big fan of 70s and 80s nostalgia films, Now and Then just completely missed the mark for me. The all-star cast was sadly wasted with this dull, unimaginative plot and lazy storytelling. From start to finish, it felt like the movie was trying to make you cry by throwing every possible cheesy narrative your way, all dressed up in cutesiness and golden sunshine.",Now and Then
14,manitobaman81,Good,7,29 August 2014,"My bet is that you will laugh, cry and cheer. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Like other great dramadies, it is filled with charm, innocence and drama and romance. I thought it was a nice mix. The casting is great and Demi Moore gives a performance of a lifetime. It is an emotionally uplifting movie that will raise your morale. Unfairly dismissed by some as formulaic, this kind of character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. I found it entertaining and it left me with a warm feeling. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters.",Now and Then
15,jessegehrig,An out of this world adventure suitable for any teenage boy!,2,20 February 2014,"I'm not this movie's intended audience so I don't know if its fair for me to review it, I mean obviously since I am writing a review ultimately I've already decided its fair enough, so here goes- Nope. Movie dumb. Hey what it is is a toothless bloodless story and Rosie O'Donnell. The plot is just, I mean its crumby ,its a feeble by-the-numbers snore. The characters are forgettable and the setting is obviously a stage. My problem with Rosie O'Donnell is she can't act, she plays herself, which would be fine if she was a nice person, but she is not, Rosie sucks. OK, if you are looking for a grandmother friendly movie or a movie to show to like preteen girls at some ill-conceived church youth group thing, then Now And Then is the perfect movie for you!",Now and Then
16,Movie-12,"Beautifully crafted, but relies totally on subplots. **1/2 (out of four)",6,12 August 2000,"NOW AND THEN / (1995) **1/2 (out of four)	Lesli Linka Glatter's touching drama ""Now and Then"" is a misguided tale that beautifully captures the many painful and joyful ups and downs of four best friends growing up in the 1970's. Best compared to ""Stand By Me"" and ""Man in the Moon,"" this tender movie gently touches base with the delicate time period when young girls experience the confusions and emotions that are present in the process of puberty.	The plots happens over the eventful summer of 1970. The film details the lives of four best friends, Samantha (Gaby Hoffmann), Teeny (Thora Birch), Roberta (Christina Ricci), and Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore). During this summer, the girls find it necessary to ware bras for the first time in their lives, a factor in which they have varied feelings. This is also the summer where they discover their town's horrifying secret about a young boy who mysteriously died thirty years ago. Pursuing the girls are the neighbor boys named the Wormers.The film is told in the present through the girls who are now adults. The adult actresses, including Rosie O'Donnell, Rita Wilson, Demi Moore, and Melanie Griffith, appear only as wraparound bookends to fill the audience's desire to see whom the girls turn out to be. However, they are not examined in enough detail to fulfill these desires.""Now and Then"" filmmakers describe the characters descriptively and vividly with believable character traits like curiosity and lively spirit. They are very well cast by some of Hollywood's biggest names, who perform with a sweet, gentle, fitting attitude. The movie's actors are willing to give more than the script allows.	The problem lies not within character, however, but in plot. The film seems unclear of what it is about, whether it wants to detail the lives of four adolescent girls, discovering the death of Dear Johnny, childhood mischief: the story is so easily distracted. The film persistently adds in unnecessary clichés and predictable character formality involving relationship conflicts and novice romances. Yet at the same time the plot is executed artistically with an enjoyable sense of style and an effective mood along with a soundtrack that is true to the 70's era.	""Now and Then"" is the kind of movie that relies entirely on subplots to propel its distracted story line along. I compare the film's structure to that of a deformed tree, where there are plenty of narrative roots and the story branches off in many directions, but it does not have a thick trunk for support.",Now and Then
17,Shopaholic35,One of the best adolescent nostalgia movies ever made.,10,31 January 2014,"I see a lot of people comparing this movie to Stand By Me but the problem with that is if you were old enough to see Stand By Me when it was first released then hate to break it to you but this movie is not targeted at your demographic. Just because something feels like a remake of a movie made a decade before does not mean that the new movie is in anyway terrible. Take Heathers and Mean Girls for example both good movies but in my opinion Mean Girls appealed to me more as it was aimed at my demographic. If you can't judge a movie on it's own merits than perhaps you need to chill a little.Anyway, Now and Then is one of those movies that sticks with you for life. Recently I just converted a friend of mine in her mid twenties to loving this movie. I was dumbfounded that she had missed this right of passage that most young girls had when this movie was released. Every girl can relate to one of the four characters and it reminds you of a simpler time where all that mattered were boys, having fun and navigating your way through growing up. I still remember taking Cosmo quizzes and thinking they had an insight into your soul, preparing for your first kiss and investing in my first bra. I know there are a lot of parents who think this movie is overly sexualised but guess what when your kid is going through puberty nothing will turn them back into your precious little angel. Accept it and hope they have supportive friends who they can share their journey with.If you watch the movie with an open heart you will find a great cast that feels real in their characters, a brilliant soundtrack that increases your nostalgia level and a deep and meaningful storyline. It deals with subject matter that many adolescent movies steer clear of, just because you are young does not mean you haven't experienced hurt and pain like an adult. Adolescents needs to know that life is not always perfect and that there will be ups and downs but everyone is all in it together. I cannot strongly recommend this movie enough if you are willing to enjoy this movie for what it is, a fantastic coming of age movie.",Now and Then
18,Darkest_Rose,I Love This Movie,10,5 January 2003,"Now and Then used to be my favorite movie when I was younger and it still remains one of my favorites. It's about four friends that have made a pact when they were younger that if one of them ever needed each other they would be there. Now that time has come. Chrissy( Rita Wilson) is about to deliver a child and she wants her friends to be there. Roberta( Rosie O'Donnell), Teeny( Melanie Griffith) and Samantha(Demi Moore) have all arrived and are about to reunite again. While all this is happening, Samantha is telling the story of their childhood and how their friendship began. In the younger days, samantha is played by Gaby Hoffmann, Roberta by Christina Ricci, Teeny by Thora Birch and Chrissy is being played by Ashleigh Aston Moore.

The four friends made a promise to come if any of them needs help. While the grownups talk they start talking about when they were 12 years old. Then you see flashbacks of when they were kids. My favorite part was when the girls find the boys (the wormers) skinnydipping in a pond. as revenge, the girls take their clothes and runs. I rewind that part 4 times just to see it. I also liked when Crazy Pete saved one of the girls. the movie makes you want to laugh, and it makes you want to cry. 10 stars.",Now and Then

The roles the girls take are all nicely stereo-typical, the princess, the prude, the tom-boy, the 'normal' one - they could have been the Spice Girls!

21,SajeevaS,Great then and still great now,10,2 September 2004,"It's the year 2004, and i finally get to watch this movie...and i regret for waiting. An amazing achievement. The four young 'then' rising starlet's prove their acting abilities such that i was shocked that neither one of them left a stage with an award. Christina Ricci's tomboy looks were fitted perfectly into the character of Roberta, equipped with the ever famous Rosie O'Donell as her future self. Thora Birch's blonde hair image and personality was molded so well, that Melanie Griffith seemed like her mom. Gaby Hoffman's resemblance to Demi Moore would have been slightly hazy, but lets not forget then 13 year old Gaby's performance. Ashleigh Aston Moore..what ever happened to her?The casting is great, and truthfully, the 'then' kids provide a better performance than the adult 'now' women.Being released in '95, when Demi Moore was the apple of Hollywood, Christina Ricci was making it big with Casper, and Melanie Griffith's relationship with Antonio Banderas was in the spotlight, this movie would have generated quite a lot of hype.The best thing about this movie is the wonderful nostalgic feeling, that it leaves you at the end- making it a good feel good finale.I believe that Leslie Linka Glatter did an excellent job in directing- even the 'not so good' scenes were enhanced by a catchy vintage song from back in the days, which made you go along with it.Check out Dewon Sawa's first performances as Scott Wormer, and Brendan Frasier as the Vietnam Vet. All in all this movie speaks a lot about friendships- and being a pure chick flick, doesn't stop this movie from being soppy, girly or ditsy.As for my personal rating, i would give it without a doubt a 5/5.",Now and Then

23,Colonel Ted,A shoddy re-hash of Stand By Me,1,21 January 2000,"Virtually every wannabe feminist film since Thelma and Louise has taken its cue from a male film, but instead of doing an imaginative variation like T&L, has settled for out and out rip off and a simple minded ""girls are better than guys"" message. Bad Girls was just Young Guns in skirts and Now and Then is just girly remake of Stand By Me, which frankly doesn't deserve the humiliation of being mentioned in the same review. Demi Moore and co. reminisce at their friend's baby wake 20 years later about the summer where they tried to solve the death of a boy in their town, which is acted out by the likes of Christina Ricci and Thora Birch. However that is merely a feeble plot device, because what mostly happens is that the girls giggle about sex, talk about puberty, take revenge on boys, sing on their bicycles and share each other's troubles. How fascinating. What little plot does go on is boring, predicable (almost perfunctory) and sickly sentimental pap. Stand By Me was a great rites of passage drama with great, believable characters, a driving plot, a touching script and performance to match, all handled superbly by director Rob Reiner. Now and Then is simply a shameless waste of a talented set of young stars to satisfy the whims of the older stars. Especially Moore, (who also produced) and is further proof of her habit of wasting good talent for her own purposes: see also The Scarlet Letter. The only noteworthy thing in the entire the film is how anyone could have thought that the elf-like Ricci could have grown up to become Rosie O'Donnell!",Now and Then

It struck a cord somewhere. Its been long since i have spend quality time with my friends and have been as carefree as Teeny, Chrissy, Roberta and Samantha. I long for those days when we could hang out just for the sake of hanging out. Each of these characters had problems of their own but they were always there for each other and had each others backs.This movie moves back and forth to the past to the happenings of a particular summer when they were 12 and brings us back to present where everybody are adults. That summer in the 70s was instrumental in creating a bond between the girls that still lasts and a promise was made for eternal friendship. When any one of them needs the others they will be there her no matter what. I wish i had friends with whom i could have made such a pact. In any case the movie evokes a strong feeling of nostalgia for the days gone by. The parts from the 70s are very good and entertaining. The casting for the young actresses were spot on match with their adult counterparts played by big stars like Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith, Rita Wilson and Rosie O'Donnel.

Although the acting is fine, there are so many off elements here that I can't believe I sat through the whole thing.For one thing, I would not let my teenager watch this. Their focus on sex is astounding for a group of 4 twelve year olds. Yuck! This is sooo disturbing to me. I assume that when I was a teen and that was on my mind constantly I was relating to them and their curiosity, but that also would have caused me to think of those things even more, which is (I'm sure) not what any parent wants for their child.There are also the regular profane outbursts by one particular child, the fights and more that promote a way of life that is not desirable for children and that I cannot be entertained by them acting it out.If you are going to watch this, please leave the kids out of it.

27,simnia-1,Powerful memories of 1970,8,13 May 2006,"I watch this film every few years, and it has a powerful effect on me every time I watch it.I personally experienced the summer of 1970 as a very young male teen in a manner very similar manner as shown in this movie, riding around with my girlfriend on a bike to some creeks and waterfalls, and that was one of the happiest years of my life. The songs popular that summer were almost exactly the ones played in this movie (with a few anachronistic exceptions), the Vietnam War was on everybody's minds as shown, and girls and guys really acted as they did in the movie.It's interesting that there are almost no movies that are similar to this one in that they show girl friendship with a positive mood and a retro setting with many oldies like this. Since this film has a strong, almost cult-like following, that should be a hint to filmmakers that there is an important, undeveloped niche for successful movies along the lines of ""Now and Then."" Coming-of-age movies are always popular, anyway, and I'd much rather see those than comic book movies, video game movies, and mindless remakes of movies that were already marginal in the '60s and '70s.The oldies in this film are great, and they are exactly what girls listened to and liked back then. My girlfriend back then liked the humorous lyrics about honeymoon night in ""Band of Gold,"" and even my mother used to dance to that song on a single back then. The fact that modern generations of girls still like these songs is sort of reassuring, since clearly those songs have successfully spanned three generations of female favor. ""Hitchin' a Ride"" was another popular and lively song that everybody liked back then, both male and female (especially my girlfriend back then), as was ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"" (which also appeared the 1998 movie ""You've Got Mail""). There are some bad anachronisms, though, which really spoil the effect for people very familiar with summer 1970. ""Respect Yourself"" didn't come out until October 1971, ""Knock Three Times"" didn't come out until November 1970, ""I'll Be There"" didn't come out until September 1970, and ""Midnight Rider"" didn't come out until October 1972. Since so much of the effect of this movie comes from its oldies, such carelessness in its selection of oldies is inexcusable. When you're growing up rapidly during adolescence, each year is very different in nature, so to mix 1970 songs with 1971 and 1972 songs is a glaring error. All they had to do to ensure accuracy was merely look at a list! Some extremely suitable songs from summer 1970 they could have included instead would be ""My Baby Loves Lovin',"" ""Mississippi Queen,"" ""Mississippi"" (cheerful though somewhat obscure, by John Phillips), ""Hey Mister Sun"" (very positive!), ""Save the Country"" (very positive!), ""Tighter, Tighter,"" ""Get Ready,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Mamma Told Me,"" ""Gimme Dat Ding"" (my girlfriend liked that upbeat humorous one back then), ""For You Blue,"" and for a very heavy, powerful effect: ""Song of Joy"" by Miguel Rios. Actually my favorite song in the film might be the ending song ""Now and Then,"" presumably made just for this movie. That's a very powerful modern song to end a movie full of already powerful music. The movie's soundtrack album is great, though there is some very nice incidental piano music in the movie that wasn't included on the soundtrack album, unfortunately, along with a few other songs.A few more comments about anachronisms... It's very unlikely a girl in 1970 would be listening to ""Daydream Believer"" by The Monkees, a song from October 1967, because The Monkees quickly fell out of favor in a major way by early 1968. Even girls who absolutely loved them for their first two years almost universally wrote them off as childish and out of style by then. The rest of the public hated them even more! ""Sugar Sugar"" (July 1969) wasn't quite as hated in 1970, but that was also getting a little old by then. Also, sex education was prevalent and fairly sophisticated by the late '60s, and was taught in elementary school, so any scene of a 12-year-old girl being taught exclusively by her mother at home on critical sex topics is totally unrealistic. That sort of backwards sex education was common in the 1950s, I believe, but not in the 1960s-1970s. To be more critical of this movie, the plot was not very memorable to me. Each time I see it, I find I've forgotten major parts of the plot, like the storm drain part, the cemetery part, or the childbirth part. That suggests that those parts of the movie don't fit very well, and/or that the movie is a conglomerate of unrelated incidents. That wouldn't be so bad if the incidents were realistic, but I didn't find the storm drain part very realistic. (What girl would climb into a storm drain late at night in a rain storm, for example? And in the worst case she could just hang onto the bars until she could float out.) Likewise, I didn't think the modern day part fit particularly well, either, and didn't add much to the story, relative to the amount of distraction and interruption it incurred.Overall, though, I definitely like this film, due to the oldies, the treehouse, the summery feeling, the feeling of friendship and learning and exploration, the sense of permanent friendship (so rare in real life), the enthusiasm, and overall positive feeling. The world could really use some more positive films like this one.",Now and Then
28,moviedude-72,"An all star cast, Now and Then is a touching friendship film!",7,31 August 2006,"Somewhat reminiscent of the classic Stand by Me, Now and Then is a delightful, touching movie about four girls trying to come to terms with death, loyalty, and independence during the 1970s. Their reunion in the 1990s enables them to put the past in perspective and to reconfirm their need for each other.Produced by Demi Moore, who also plays the adult version of one of the characters, ''Now and Then'' concentrates on the bumpy, bittersweet transition between childhood and adolescence. Loss of innocence, sexual awakening, the first glances at adult betrayals and disappointments -- that's all here, and played quite nicely by two corresponding quartets of actresses. Highlited with amazing performances from Christina Ricci, Thora Birch, Gabby Hoffman and Ashleigh Aston Moore.Overall, the flick not particularly deep, but it's a good-natured, sprightly comedy that ought to find its most appreciative audience among preteens.7.5/10 See It If You Liked: My Girl, Stand by Me, The Breakfast Club-Luke Rowe",Now and Then

30,lucky_star_1,"a fresh, feel-good and fun movie, focusing on lives of typically emotional teens",9,12 December 2006,"Roberta (Rosie O'Donnell), Samantha (Demi Moore) and Teeny (Melanie Griffith) and Chrissy (Rita Wilson) all made a promise to each other twenty years ago that they would forever remain soul mates and reunite when one of them was in need. Now, Chrissy is about to give birth and that time has come. Cue back Then to the Summer of 1970, to four friends having the time of their lives as well as going through experiences of their own...In all honesty, Rosie, Demi, Melanie and Rita are rarely in the movie - they are shown at the beginning and nearer to the end. Although when they are shown, they seem to share great chemistry and play the roles of the older version of the four lifelong friends well. Demi's role is particularly memorable, because as Sam, she is the storyteller throughout the movie. Onto the younger cast - which adds up to being generally faultless. Christina Ricci excels as tomboyish Roberta, Thora Birch inspires confidence as wannabe superstar Teeny, Gaby Hoffman pulls it off as emotion-filled Samantha and Ashleigh Aston Moore is considerably funny as highly-strung Chrissy. You cannot go wrong with a cast such as this one, because the chemistry between the girls and the effort put into their performances is more than obvious.What I like about this movie is that the true life of a teenager is shown from both sides of the picture. For instance, one scene with the girls riding their bikes as they are singing along to the song 'knock three times...' is shortly followed by another scene in which Roberta is faking her own death, not just as a way to seek attention but as a way to deal with her own pain because her mother was killed. The emotional trauma of this subject strongly contrast with the high amount of fun being had by the girls as a group. Together, they are strongest. They don't have to deal with their issues alone and as we learn from Sam as the storyteller, each girl is going through a hard time. Not to mention being targeted by the Wormer boys on the street with jello balloons...I'd give this great movie 9/10 because my only criticism is that Roberta's growing romance with Scott isn't developed further. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants their spirits uplifted and wants to sing along to a highly charged 70s soundtrack, with the songs used cleverly in the movie in scenes with the four friends together - showing that girls really do just wanna have fun. Devon Sawa plays Scott Wormer, coincidentally playing the love interest of Ricci's character just like he did in Casper; so all the girls out there can feel free to swoon over him. Oh, and watch out for cameos by Hank Azaria, Bonnie Hunt and Brendan Fraser. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did",Now and Then

32,tdh_fbi,An underappreciated coming of age classic,8,29 October 2018,"In my honest opinion, ""Now and Then"" should be in the same category as ""Stand By Me"" and ""The Goonies"" as far as children/pre-teen/teen coming of age movies. To some people, it is, but I have yet to see it on one of those big retrospective lists detailing these kind of films.
The performances by the young actresses, especially those of Gabby Hoffman, Christina Ricci, and Thora Birch, are the biggest standouts to me. Their roles are so relatable even today, which was big to me considering that this film took place during a time period way before I was even born.
Another great point was the frank discussions of sex, puberty and growing up. People were unafraid to discuss these types of things in movies and film back then. In my opinion, nowadays people are so scared to touch these types of subjects in movies for fear of offending people or floating the wrong ideas to kids.
One point in this that was lacking to me, however, were the performances by the adult actresses. Don't get me wrong, I have a great amount of respect for all these ladies, especially Demi Moore and Rita Wilson. I just feel that the storyline regarding them as adults could've been expanded on a lot more, even if it meant making the movie's running time a bit longer than the filmmakers intended.All in all, despite my one grievance, ""Now and Then"" is an honest, funny, and sweet coming of age movie which will always be a classic in my mind.",Now and Then

Some say this is an inspirational movie for young girls. Just so you know, they are wrong! If you're a parent do not show this to your child. It promotes sexism in the worst ways. The girls as children are all persecuted by boys. This is taken to the absolute extreme. This is not like real life. Every interaction with the boys these girls have they act as if they are being attacked. In response they proceed to become violent physically, verbally, and by their actions.

I've tried watching that film more than 3 times, and I've never watched it all the way through. Somehow, a bunch of young adolescent boys swearing too much doesn't appeal much to me, even though I'm the same age myself. Now and Then made me think a lot about how important friendship is.

THAT'S the only reason I've sat through it twice now. Apparently, O'Donnell, Moore, Griffiths, and Wilson (who BTW, hasn't acted in anything else, similar to the child actress who played her character's younger self) had nothing better to do one day and decided to make this movie, which for them, probably took all of a day given their two scenes together.",Now and Then

I don't mind sweet, small town retro (that never really existed) and I am a feminist, so girl power is fine by me.BUT...it still doesn't cut it. For starters, all the homes exteriors are unquestionably mid-80's/90's style homes. EVERY house should have been a split level or a ranch (I grew up in exactly that type of sub division). While the interiors are overall more accurate,. houses that small wouldn't possibly have such large interior rooms. Teeny's room has painted art deco furniture---fashionable in 1995, NOT 1970 (and Teeny appears to be the wealthiest of the group). Really, couldn't they have borrowed ""The Wonder Years"" set? The other thing is the truly, utterly horrible acting from the adults. Rita Wilson portrays Chrissy as fully mentally unbalanced. Keeps her home exactly the way her mother had it decorated??? Races around like a shrill harpy??? I kept waiting for someone in a white coat with a net to come and take her away. Yes, she could be nerdy and traditional--that doesn't equal totally crazy.Since they're also all 37 now, it doesn't hold water on that level (they all still act twelve, with apologies to 12 year old). Unless she had serious fertility problems, Chrissy would have wanted to get pregnant the second she got married. Athletic, cute Christina Ricci turns into fat, ugly Rosie O'Donnnel??? And Melanie Griffith (more like 18 in 1970) is already far too old, and simply horrible.In all, if nothing else is on, watch it. But it isn't even fun in a campy way.",Now and Then

42,vmcdavidson,Grown-ups are a dull letdown,7,12 August 2000,"In this coming-of-age story set in both the 1970s and 1990s, the younger cast is brilliant and natural, particularly Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffmann. The script soars with female teenage humor, friendship, and pre-puberty naivete -- a sprightly soundtrack of 70s tunes takes older viewers down memory lane. But then, just when the story about four best friends during summer vacation in a new housing development is clipping along at a compelling pace, SLAM! The film jumps forward 20 years and the girls are grown-ups. And at these points, the movie groans along like a garbage disposal with too many potato peels crammed in it.Remarkably, the dismal acting of these veteran actresses isn't as bad as the lack-luster script during these ""flash-fronts"". Were there separate writers for this film? I usually adore Rosie O'Donnell, but casting her as the grown Roberta was a horrible choice. Demi Moore's character is now self-absorbed and self-pitying, and Melanie Griffin (super-famous actress) and Rita Wilson (pregnant homemaker) are insipid caricatures. None of these women are one-quarter as interesting or delightful as they were when they were adolescents, particularly Roberta (Ricci/O'Donnell). The film's flipping back and forth between the decades becomes quickly annoying.Suggestion: Rent the video, and fast-forward through the adult stuff. Fast-forwarding the tape won't rob anyone of the film's message (something like ""friendship is forever,"" or ""don't go into cemeteries at night""), and it'll save you about 30 minutes of fidgeting, waiting for the film to turn back to the four girls. At least they have fun. And the treehouse they save up to buy is every girl's idea of truly cool!",Now and Then

The story of four girls in the early 1970's is about growing up and standing on your own two feet. That is something all the girls have problems with, but of course they succeed... as in most lives. Too bad though that the performances of the young actresses are wasted by the older actresses (Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith, Rita Wilson & Rosie O'Donell). They star in the beginning and end, making only the middle worthwhile. Their acting is corny, but that also has something to do with the script and directing.

That summer was like a turning point in their lives, up to that summer they all had sweet idealistic lives, thinking that their town is protected from ""outside"" and that nothing bad will ever happen in their lives.

BUT: The energy of the four girlfriends, the fun which they have together and the freedom (I mean no duty, no responsibility) which they spread, make this movie absolutely rewarding to see.I have enjoyed the irrelevant adventures, have laughed at funny situations and have ENJOYED SAMANTHA (Gaby Hoffman). As I saw this movie I wished to be under these girls. It is unimportant whether this movie show the adventures and experiences of girls or boys. Friendship- that is the message of this movie.Oh, I wished, I would be such a teenager, with such friends in such a town. For me this movie is a fairy-tale. A marvelous fairy-tale.",Now and Then

The scenery of Savannah, Georgia, was brilliant, also all the actors were brilliant and I never wanted the movie to end.  The sex and comedy really go together, also the sadness of death and ""crazy Pete"".  The music was brilliant, and this is probably the only film I have watched more than three times. The director and the writer are excellent, not to mention the actors. Hats off to the children in their 70's parts.Excellent and well done.",Now and Then

68,miki_t,"In two hours I was taken on an emotional journey, and this film brought it about. I was glued to the TV for two hours non-stop.",10,21 June 2001,"Flicking through the TV channels, bored one Wednesday evening, I came across a movie. It didn't appear much to start off with, but as I watched it, as I got into it, it quickly turned into one of the best movies I have seen.
I'm not an emotional guy, and movies don't have an emotional affect on me, but watching this one, I laughed, I jumped with fright once or twice, and, yes I'll admit, I came very near close to crying more than once.
The main storyline is simple, yet it is the simplicity that is its key. The actors are all superb, and I sure don't say that very often! Particular praise goes out Gaby Hoffmann for her brilliant role as little Samantha.
It's a tale of friendship and trust, and that really appeals to me, because those are two very important things in life. The intricate sub-plots for each of the characters add depth to the film and fill out the main storyline, and the various emotions portrayed - love, sadness, joy, fear - are cunningly inter-woven to take the viewer on what is in a sense an emotional rollercoaster.That is why I like this film, and why it is high on my favourite films list. I hope that you get a chance to watch it, and enjoy it, too.********** - 10 starsHave fun!Miki-T",Now and Then

Even for those of us that didn't grow up in the 1970s, seeing these girls' unforgettable summer makes your heart ache. Whenever I see this movie I wish I grew up in small-town Shelby, too. This movie will make you laugh and cry, and ultimately make you wish and think you were there and you knew these girls. Whenever I think of this movie, I think of all the great times these girls had together. No matter how much I grow older, I still fall in love with this movie over and over. Their struggles, and joys, are those that are timeless and we can all relate to. I recommend it completely.",Now and Then
71,majwooten,A Baby-Boomer's coming-of-age movie,9,1 April 2007,"Now and Then is an excellent coming-of-age movie that gives voice to both the Baby-Boomers' perspective and feminism. The movie's look at the American family provides critique to those changes in family dynamics peculiar to the Baby-Boomer childhood. Beyond its treatment of family dynamics, the plot entertains through adventure; that adventure underscores the loss of freedom in American childhood to do dangerous things typical in a Baby-Boomer childhood that we dared not tell our parents. The cast was solid, although the youth-to-adult match-ups bothered me. I struggled with Christina Ricci growing up to become Rosie O (ironically they delivered the best acting performances). If you enjoy coming of age movies like Stand by Me, Now and Then is its feminine counterpart. In both of these movies, the narrator reflects on the beauty of being twelve years old--living in the moment and having pure friendships. If you enjoy movies that celebrate sisterhood over the generations like 'The Joy Luck Club' or 'A League of Our Own' (another Rosie O movie), Now and Then is a superb choice.",Now and Then

I watched this film with my girlfriend, when she picked it out at Blockbuster I cringed at the fact of having to watch it, but you know, I admit, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I though I was going to. It was cute, the plot was good, it actually kind of reminded me of another fantastic film called ""Stand By Me"", but in a girl's perspective of course. If you have young children, heck, if you don't have young children, give this one a shot. This is a film I think any Female would probably enjoy. If your a dude, put away all your manly inhibitions for about an hour and a half, don't expect too much going into the film, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Now and Then

75,re3000,Partly beautiful...,6,25 April 2003,"Even as a seventeen year old ""boy"", I really enjoyed parts of this movie ;-)For me it's a kind of reference for that often told story of the summer of first love: all of the well-known cliché-characters - the four girls and their special patterns of behavior in relation to each other, the guys, the strange old man... - are portrayed and played in a nicely detailed way. The story development works pretty fine, too, and all in all builds up an at least ""comprehensible"" atmosphere, being far away from letting you forget you're watching a film or even being realistic, but as that's not what I'd expect from such a film, that doesn't really bother me.BUT... the parts of the story playing in the present REALLY annoy me. In addition to the unmotivated kind-of-story with it's incredibly boring and unmoving ending, all actresses deliver such a bad work, that Demi Moore actually makes the best impression to me - and she's not better at all than in her other movies.In order to rate this film in an honest way an AS IT IS, I can give it only 6 out of 10 - I highly recommend it, nevertheless.",Now and Then
76,NotPavlovsDog,"Good, But Not Great",6,2 June 2009,"Having just recently watched ""Now and Then"" again, I decided to check out what other people thought. Reading through a lot of the comments, I noticed that many compared this film to Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me."" I guess I would consider the two to be of the same genre (coming of age), but, to me, that's really the only thing the two have in common.""Now and Then"" is a fun film. It's got quick and easy laughs that many (not just teenage girls) people will find humorous. I will say that ""Then"" is vastly more entertaining than ""Now""; the adult versions of the characters briefly open and close the story, with forgettable filler in between. ""Then"" offers some slight depth of character for the four girls who embody stereotypes of adolescent girls (the princess, the tomboy, the sheltered one, the seemingly normal one). ""Now"" still embraces those stereotypes (the princess has become an actress, still obsessed with body image; the normal one has become a writer, who showcases her intellect by wearing black and smoking). There is no growth amongst the adults. ""Now"" is focused on Chrissy's pregnancy and reminiscing, while ""Then"" seems to get distracted amongst its various subplots (unraveling Crazy Pete, watching parents fight, bicker with boys, watch movies, build a tree house, ride bikes) without ever really coming to a true conclusion.For a movie hailed as a ""Stand By Me"" for girls, the film is lacking in its overall sincerity. Whereas Reiner's film grapples (and in some cases overcomes) 'mature' themes like death, acceptance, and separation, Glatter's film skates over the big issues. ""Stand By Me"" captures true childhood friendship (friends help friends get leeches off their backs) ""Now and Then"" is only truly poignant, well, now and then.I'd recommend ""Now and Then"" for a time when you are in the mood for something lighthearted and distracting. I'd second the opinion that it's great for a girl's sleepover or something. But if you are looking for something a little deeper and, in my opinion, more true to childhood friendship, I'd tell you to skip this movie and go straight to ""Stand By Me."" Note: ""Stand By Me"" is rated R; ""Now and Then"" PG-13. Both films have great soundtracks.",Now and Then
77,Kruzicle,"A User's Movie, Not a Critic's Movie",7,13 January 2014,"I watched this movie when I was 11. Like all movies you watch when you are 11, it has that nostalgia value that no critic can touch. Sure, it's not entirely realistic or in any way makes you contemplate your life on a deeper level. It's one of those movies you just accept, flaws and all, because it's catchy and fun and full of childhood nostalgia. The cheese factor is pretty low, compared to many other coming-of-age films. So yes, it may have a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I will always have a special place in my heart for this movie. And yes, because I'm sure everyone wants to know, I SO wanted to be Roberta.

78,Debaser_Lo,Love it.,10,20 April 2004,"Having seen Now and Then over 150 times since it was first released in '95, one may assume I would be sick of it by now. Well, I'm not. The first time I watched it was with my cousin. I was seven, she was five, and we both fell in love with the music, characters (and the actresses that played them), the plot, and the movie in general. We wished we could have grown up in a town like Shelby, with best friends to count on and mysteries to explore. Now, being obviously older, we still wish we could have had that chance, and plan to give our future children the semi-exciting lives we never had. Now and Then is a classic, simply put, and deserves more recognition for its talented actors and touching story.",Now and Then

80,kinziekinz,All for one and one for all,10,21 June 2006,"This film really does show the friendship and loyalty that is forged by a group of young girls, who when they said, friends forever, meant it. It was so long ago, years and years in fact, that i first saw the film, but i still absolutely love it. The friendship which the girls have in their childhood really is a lot like other people's childhood friendships. The tree house, swimming, bike trips, mystery. It has always been around.The film starts with Demi Moore's character Samantha returning back to her home town, a place which she didn't really want to see again, but she still made the trip back home, all because of a pact which she made with her friends as a young girl. Whenever we need one another. We will be there. and they kept their promise when Chrissy asked for their help, to get through her pregnancy, and when expecting her first child to be born at any moment they came. After returning back home, memories from one particular summer flood back, the summer they got their tree house and the summer that held many mysteries and drama. It was the summer where they grew up and learned to fend for themselves. As Demi Moore says at the end of the young girls story- ""The tree house was supposed to bring us more independence, but what the summer actually brought us was independence from each other."" and that was how their summer of mystery ended, but it was not the end of their friendship.",Now and Then

82,pualani726,my opinions of Now and Then,9,8 March 2005,"i personally love this movie. its a great story about 4 girls who slowly discover that they are no longer the innocent little children they have grown accustomed to. they are growing up and with that, each girl discovers or comes to terms with something about herself. i, being a teenage girl, relate to many of the elements in this story. my parents divorced at a young age and i had a hard time with it- thats the Samantha in me. i discovered the need for wearing a bra and felt like an outcast because i was the only one of my friends who needed to- thats the Roberta. i always had a grown up sense to me when in fact- i was still a kid and had to remember to enjoy life as it comes and try not to grow up too quickly- thats a bit of Teeney. Now, unlike Chrissy, I was never as naive- I was usually the one giving the ""trash- mouth"" information- as her mother puts it. I also had a friend, Johnny, who died when i was younger, so the ""Dear Johnny"" thing kinda hit close to home. But i loved that. I first fell in love with this movie when it came out- I was about 6. Now, at almost 16, I feel like I can relate to it even more because I have grown up a bit and all of the feelings in those four girls were all mixed around in my little self. In summation, I think that Now and Then is one of the best coming-of-age stories I've ever seen and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Whatever age you are, you can surely relate to one-if not all the characters. Its a touching story about growing up,loving life and the bonds of friendship.",Now and Then

I thought it was amazing good story with a solid story and almost great cast. I had an issue with Rosie O'Donnell in this movie, granted I have no issue with her, She was one of my favorite parts in A League of Their Own but she was miscast. Gabby Hoffman playing the younger Demi Moore made sense as did Thora Birch being Meanie Griffith. I wasn't aware of Ashleigh Aston Moore but her being the younger Rita Wilson was inspired casting. I will admit I am biased because I had the biggest crush on Christina Ricci when I was a kid and I was taken aback at the older version being played by Rosie O'Donnell. What? They couldn't get a better actress? Christina Ricci was a bigger star and a better actress than O'Donnell(No offense) and it bothered me. Everything else was on point just that part.",Now and Then
84,leggatt_julie_,What a Fab Film!!!!,10,1 November 2005,"I have see this film at lease 50 times, it is my favourite film ever!!! I would recommend it to everyone, its a film that suits all ages and people, I would say its more of a chick's film, but I do know guys who have watched it and liked it.There are so many true phrases in the film, the best ones have to be when crazy Pete is talking to Sam by dear Jonny's grave, and the speech at the end by Sam, in the tree house holding the baby. I think both quotes have so much meaning behind them, and really made me cry! The whole film has a meaning to it, about when your younger, the way you have a care free attitude, and then something changes, and you grow up, and things happen in your life that you cant help.
