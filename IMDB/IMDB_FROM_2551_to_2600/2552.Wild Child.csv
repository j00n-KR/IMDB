0,SnoopyStyle,Cute Emma Roberts vehicle,6,2 February 2014,"Poppy Moore (Emma Roberts) is bratty petulant teen causing problems with her father's new girlfriend. She's been bitter ever since her mother's death. Her father has had enough and ships her off to an English private boarding school for girls run by Mrs. Kingsley (Natasha Richardson). She immediately makes an enemy of the head girl Harriet (Georgia King). She doesn't get along with her roommates (Juno Temple, Linzey Cocker, Sophie Wu, Kimberley Nixon) at first either. Eventually they decide to work together to help Poppy get kicked out of school and back home.I'm sure the girls had fun making the movie. That doesn't automatically make the movie fun. Emma Roberts is cute. Even as a bratty blonde, she has an easy charm about her. This movie relies heavily on her to drive this movie. Other than Emma, there isn't much to recommend about this movie. There are some minor jokes like referring to Hogwarts just as Shirley Henderson walks in. But there are very few funny moments.",Wild Child
1,studioAT,Emma Roberts shines,5,27 January 2017,"As a vehicle for the rising star that is Emma Roberts this film works well. Although the other youngsters do well in their roles, its Roberts who shines in every scene.She manages to be spoilt, funny, pretty and vulnerable all at the same time, and that's not easy to do in a script that doesn't seem to know whether its aiming for the teen or adult audience.There are some fun life lessons to be learnt here, and it certainly has its heart in the right place. It's not worth wasting time asking questions about the plot, or thinking about the very cringy not funny moments featuring Jason Watkins, because this film really is all about fun.It's not surprising that Emma Roberts went on to do bigger and better things after this, because she's fab here.",Wild Child
2,neil-476,Undemanding but pleasing entertainment,7,27 August 2008,"The plot of this teen comedy is familiar stuff - spoilt, arrogant, rich bitch Californian teen is shipped by her father to a traditional English girls boarding school. Despite her resolving to get kicked out at the earliest opportunity, and irrespective of sundry plots both by her and against her, she ends up not only being turned into a decent human being, but also falling for the headmistress' hunky son.There isn't an atom of unpredictability in this movie, but there are some winning performances, a lot of smiles, some nice lines in the script, and handful of solid laughs. And a couple of moving moments, the best of which is delivered by Aidan Quinn.An undemanding but pleasing and rather sweet movie. You're never going to put it on your list of favourites, but you're going to enjoy it.",Wild Child
3,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Wild Child,7,12 December 2008,"I guess Emma Roberts' more memorable role was taking on the iconic Nancy Drew character, but now she exchanges those sleuthing skills and good manners for spoilt brat antics. Swinging from one end of the spectrum of an ideal kid to a spoilt and bratty one, her Poppy Moore character in Wild Child is a rich kid who has issues with discipline because she thinks she could get her way with her devil may care attitude and wads of cash. With her relationship with her father going to the doldrums, she gets shipped off to an English boarding school in an effort to be schooled in the prim and proper, and thus sets up plenty of room for your typical fish out of water story.Naturally as the loner who stands out because of her rather uncouth behaviour and fashion sense, this was somewhat a throw back to The House Bunny, where the protagonist is clearly out of place, and remains to be seen if it is herself who would be assimilated into the norm, or if she could be the trend-setter and begin a serious case of behavioural osmosis.For starters, this is clearly chick flick territory, with all characters being girls (it's set in an all girls boarding school) and the only male supporting characters happened to be her dad (Aidan Quinn), the school principal's son Freddie (Alex Pettyfer) for romantic purposes, and Nick Frost who cameos as a small town hairstylist. So you can imagine the amount of bitching that would go around in the film, where Poppy offends the head student on her first day on multiple fronts, thereby starting off some serious personal vendetta issues. Or how Poppy is initially unwelcome by everyone in her dormitory because her stubbornness got them all detention, before they decide to assist her in a win-win situation - getting her expelled so that she could return home.Wild Child is surprisingly entertaining with a good story to tell, even though it's the usual about having friends for life versus the superficial ones that one tend to meet from time to time. I guess for parents this could be one of those child-safe movies to bring their kids to, and hopefully to have some of its positive messages rub off on their kids. Written by Lucy Dahl, daughter of the renowned Roald Dahl, that credit alone provided some interest in this movie, despite the story and plot development being nothing unusual and being very predictable.But I guess predictability could still work if the ensemble cast delivered their roles convincingly, which they do, and with any movie that deals with friendship and one targetted at children, this is as plain sailing a movie as it can get - nobody dies, everyone becomes friends, tense situations get diffused amicably, and there's plenty of BFF-love to go around.",Wild Child
4,lisafordeay,Not a bad film for Natasha Richardson's final film to star in,6,4 February 2014,"Emma Roberts (who as you may have known is Julia Roberts niece) stars in this British American Comedy directed by Nick Moore. A spoilt rich brat named Poppy Moore( Emma Roberts donning a blonde wig before she ditches it for her natural hair colour)is sent off to boarding school in England as her father(played by Irish actor Aidan Quinn) is fed up of his daughters persona. Annoyed with it all she tries her best to get herself expelled from boarding school. But when she meets a couple of girls there and falls for a hunky guy(played by Alex Pettfyer from Beastly) she realizes that its the best thing her father has ever did and also she discovers something at the boarding school that will change her life forever.Overall this was a good movie as it also stars the late Natasha Richardson(The Parent Trap,Maid In Manhattan) who plays the head mistress in the film. Its sad to say that this was her final movie before she tragically died in March 2009 in a skiing accident but her legacy will live on forever. Emma Roberts played her part perfect as the ditsy spoilt brat who thinks her life is on cloud nine and some bitchy chick set her up as she was fancying her boyfriend (who happens to be the head mistresses son).If you like teen comedies or high school movies about boys and all that stuff that teens love so much then check it out. Im not the target audience for this film at all as im a 22 soon to be 23 year old chick,but I never saw it before so I got the bargain as it came in a 3 DVD pack that I got on Sunday in my local supermarket.So yeah check it out and unleash your wild child self for this British teen comedy.",Wild Child
5,vivianla,Miami To English Boarding School,7,17 April 2021,"Poppy is a girl in Miami who gets her friends to dispose of her father's gf's belongings. I wanted to see the gf.

6,jaybob,A Yank in an English school ONE MORE TIME,7,4 December 2009,"Over the years there have been many films about a transplanted American in an English school. This time it is a teen aged spoiled girl sent to a posh English school.Emma Roberts, niece of Julia & daughter of Eric Roberts is an absolute delight, she eventually will be as talented as her Aunt & Father.We have the usual craziness & silliness that we find in all such comedies.Then of course all is redeemed usually by some sporting event, This time its Lacrosse.Nick Moore directed first time screenplay writer Lucy Dahl's serviceable script.Natasha Richardson in her final role is fine as the Headmistress & Alex Pettyfer is good as her teen-aged son. Aiden Quinn is perfect as Emma's father. The entire cast is young & refreshing.Rating is a proper PG-13, This is primarily a teen type filmwith some raunchy teen talk. It is all in good fun.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points(out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)",Wild Child
7,Sherazade,Emma's version of Pretty Woman,5,20 November 2009,"This is perhaps Emma Roberts's answer to her aunt Julia's 'Pretty Woman', it wasn't that bad, I mean she did not come off as a wanna-be Julia Roberts but something was just off with the film. The first half seemed like the director was trying too hard to get the audience to believe that sweet little Emma Roberts could be so bratty. I enjoyed it, but it could have been better. There were way too many spoofs (Kiera Knightley, Kate Winslet, Sporty Spice, Ashley Tisdale, Brenda Song etc. etc.) for my liking and Alex Pettyfer was given too little to do in the film. It was Natasha Richardson's(R.I.P.) last film and she held her own but other than that, the film was just average.",Wild Child
8,saadgkhan,Starts Off as Dreadful and turn into Mediocre!,3,14 August 2010,"WILD CHILD – TRASH IT ( C ) When I decided to watch Wild Child, I knew its going to be painful but I watched it for Alex Pettyfer & Emma Roberts (together). The movie starts off really dreadfully so I thought its going to be unbearable and Emma Roberts in her Blonde Wig and Snotty attitude was looking like a crap actress, she couldn't pull of the Bitchy attitude at all. Emma Roberts tried to look like uptown girl but dressed like she is coming from 70s even if you ask me in 70s they dressed much better, she was in her own mediocre lead... The moment she came back into her original brunette hairs, somehow the movie also got from Dreadful to Mediocre. Emma Roberts as blonde was crap though as brunette she did fine. Alex Pettyfer as usual in his charming attitude and looked great with Emma (sad or great actually they didn't work out in real life). Kimberley Nixon and Juno Temple did a fine job and both are quite talented. All the other girls were fine. Overall a complete teen movie with otter mediocrity, so Trash it unless like me you also want to see Alex & Emma together!",Wild Child
9,blumdeluxe,Rolling eyes guaranteed,5,18 July 2020,"""Wild Child"" tells the story of a spoiled Malibu girl who is sent to a British boarding school in order to learn some good behavior.The beginning of this movie is painful. Everything is so exaggerated that you get cramps from rolling your eyes. Even for your typical teen movie, the lack of depth in many of the characters is indeed alarming. However, you can not deny that the producers know how to get you invested in the plot and the characters and in the end you do want to know what happens even though it comes as no surprise. I guess it is, after all, kind of entertaining.All in all this is by far not a good movie but it is fair to say that what you see is what you get and that you won't be bored and I guess that is something.",Wild Child
10,raybennetthays,So bad that it's actually really bad,1,23 April 2021,"It's dull, cringey, with cardboard characters and an ability to do nothing new, the main character is super insufferable, and we're supposed to root for her? Not to mention that it has a script void of emotion or admirable moments.",Wild Child
11,apryla-58795,Not good but not terrible.,8,22 August 2018,"After trashing all her dad's new girlfriend's belongings Emma Roberts is summarily shipped off to England for boarding school...cue the same ""bratty princess resistance to her exile"" role we've seen a dozen times before.Emma Roberts is annoying plain and simple. She's not terrible in roles but every one she's in doesn't have much range. She plays different versions of bratty mean girls - again not much range but you get the sense that she is really like that IRL. When she's onscreen I want to slap the sh#% out of her. And try as I have through the years - I do not see the resemblance to her dad or her aunt. Nothing! At any rate her acting aside I did like some of the other cast members.The girls she meets when she arrives and rooms with do a good job with their roles. I've seen Juno Temple in other movies and she's pretty good but what is the deal with her hair?! It always looks like a cross between a bleached, permed, teased rat's nest and crimped with a curling iron 80's hairstyle from a music video. If I had her hair...I'd shave it off. It looks so messy and like it'd be so hot and uncomfortable. It's hard to look at. Her hair should have had its own starring role. It's distracting.The main mean girl is ridiculous (Emma Robert's character calls her ""horse face"" in the movie and I gotta say...she isn't wrong) and I feel like Natasha Richardson was wasted in this role - very sad it was her last film before her tragic death.Nick Frost made good use of his short screen time.Aidan Quinn was wasted in this film but he did a great job as always with the small role he had. He's still so good looking. The first movie I ever saw him in was Reckless. If you haven't seen it - do so. When I saw it I was like who is THAT?! So hot.Alex Pettyfer was such a cute kid. It's hard to believe he's only had 15 roles throughout his career. You would have thought he would have had more roles offered to him based solely on his good looks. I did read once that he is/was difficult to work with so maybe he got a bad rep along the way and no one wanted to hire him. What a waste. He is looking more and more like Jude Law the older he gets.Overall this film is one you've seen many times before but it wasn't terrible. I'd recommend it if you want something light to tune out to - otherwise skip it.",Wild Child
12,hollywoodshack,Pinch me to see if it's just a bad dream,3,12 May 2020,"The sports cheering routines and the fashion montages, the jumpy, squeaky lyrics all tell us this film is aimed at a children's audience. Our protagonist wants to smuggle twenty bottles of booze into her room and burn the school down. The first place the students visit in town is a liquor store. Would you want your child to see this? It was Natasha Richardson's last film. She is fine, but a kid's story, and a tasteless delinquent one at that, is beneath her talent.",Wild Child
13,annevejb,"A Second Attempt, version 1.01",10,13 September 2010,"Wild. A second attempt at a user review. My first got deleted by IMDb after someone posted a well thought out objection to it. If one has posted reviews here and found that some have been deleted by the appropriate admin, how does one react? That is what this second attempt is trying to consider. Most IMDb users will not have had their stuff appreciated in that sort of way so this is a minority interest sort of comment. If one bothers to write comments or reviews about the features that impress one then one's personal appreciation can grow. Of course there is a large range of individuals who browse such as IMDb user reviews so who knows what sort of wording one will need to use if one is to truly show one's growing understanding of a feature such as this? My solution was to use a spoiler label. I obviously need to improve on that. * My first attempt had gotten up to version 2.01. It tried to show my first reaction, amazed and impressed and needing to write a review that said so. It tried to include some of my understanding after a couple of weeks, this is one of those school stories where the star, Emma, and another are actually of the age that they are scripted at. Most others are student age, 18 to 22, but they fit in well, there is a natural look. I was also starting to tie in my reaction with links to Donnie Darko and Pretty Woman. It tried to include some of the insights into the story detail that I started to notice after a few months. As such, drafting the first version of the comment was a big help to me gaining a deeper personal understanding of the story. Wild. Poppy is scrambled and sunk, but still flying high. A 'popular girl' as in Heathers and Mean Girls. This feature explores that in its own sweet way and the true reality is not on the surface. Beneath the surface is a mess so putrid that there might be admin deletions if anyone dared to tried to seriously consider the relevance of this feature. I rate this as 10, which does not mean that I consider it to have a sweet smell. Poppy as a blooee elle. I have appropriate skills for getting sunk on this. Wild. Poppy being totally unable to face the real issues re her dad having a need for a new partner. There is a barrier and I have often come across such barriers, there is something about it that is a hidden part of our world? Wild. The relationships between the Malibu trio, Poppy and sister and best friend. It takes skill to find acceptable ways to comment? They are out of their depth and it shows. A big problem is that one is only likely to find out that there has been a successful complaint by one of your items being deleted. The reason why the deletion is not known. My only previous admin deletion was something that I tried to write another review for and that ended up by being deleted too. I currently assume that was some political factor. Example, if I write some dreamy appreciation about some dreamy actress such as 12 year old Abigail Breslin of Santa Clause 3 then I am likely to get low scores for the helpfulness of my comment. The Sarah Jane Adventures as an example, ditto Ballet Shoes, maybe HSM Concert. Wild. My paranoia can make me wonder if this deletion was political, too. If so the issue might be me writing, several times at IMDb and Amazon USA, that I consider DVD region codes to be a USA invention to allow warfare against consumers world wide, a visible component in the current world war III. My last dabble into that sort of thing was 2009, Amazon, concerning the disk sets for Emma Roberts' Unfabulous series. That must seem like paranoia to anyone but me? Not knowing the real reasons for the deletions does leave one in the dark.",Wild Child
14,SamJamie,Superior teen comedy! 9/10,9,21 May 2020,"Wild Child is a 2008 teen comedy film directed by Nick Moore and starring Emma Roberts, Alex Pettyfer, Georgia King, Kimberley Nixon, Juno Temple, Linzey Cocker, Sophie Wu, Aidan Quinn and Natasha Richardson.A rebellious Malibu princess is sent off to a strict English boarding school by her father.

15,noahgibbobaker,Emma Roberts = bad.,1,12 November 2020,"Recently I reviewed holidate, the newest film starring the one and only Emma Roberts. I noticed a craze about Emma Roberts even though she is one of the worst actresses working today. Naturally I inquired about this and somebody told me that many people love her as a result of wild child. Now that I have seen it my argument that Emma Roberts is awful is only further improved.Wild child is absolutely incomptitent in every way imaginable. I genuinely find it hard to be believe that it was realised, and I find it even harder to believe that people think that Emma Roberts is good. This project was given $20 million dollars and I haven't a clue why. To put that in perspective primer by Shane Carruth was made for $7,000 USD, and the grand budapest hotel by Wed Anderson was made for $25 million USD.The cinematography isn't terrible I guess, but it's not good by any stretch of the imagination, it's especially bad during the lacrosse scenes which just come out of nowhere an hour in. The shot composition during these scenes is also disgusting. These scenes are clearly shot and edited poorly on purpose so that it is incomprehensible to understand what the hell is happening.My biggest issues with wild child is probably the characters, but it's hard to decide. The main girl I forgot the name of is your stereotypical california gal which has never been funny, but anyway she is. One of her main characteristics is that she wants to be clean and have perfect skin, so that she keeps clean she is shown using hand sanitizer in what feels like most scenes, but what she doesn't seem to understand is that hand sanitizer is really bad for your skin! If hand sanitizer is used frequently it can cause irritation and dry skin. Emma Robert' friends don't even need to help her either. They make a big deal about trying to get whatsherface expelled and pulling her pranks with her. But they really don't need to pull any of the pranks with her, they're just putting themselves in danger of being expelled for literally no reason. None of the pranks even needed more than one person to execute them. As I'm writing about this it's really annoying me.The story being told is boring, predictable and stupid. Nobody thought this would be good a story that just had to be told, they just thought it would make a decent amount of money. Luckily only about $1.9 million profit was made which gives me a little bit more hope for humanity.The comedy only works in one instance when there is a parody of western movies. I wouldn't call this scene funny but compared to everything else it felt like a work of genius. Other than that the only laughable thing was the attempts at creating conflict.For a short movie watching this felt like watching norte, the end of history, obviously not in quality but in length. Both wild child and holidate probably don't deserve the 1/10 rating I've given them, but it definitely reflects how I feel about them very well. Anyway don't watch wild child, it's bad, and not even so bad it's good, just bad.",Wild Child
16,Cedric_Catsuits,Lame duck,3,20 August 2013,"I like Emma Roberts and she does her best here, hence two stars and not one. However her character is hardly what I'd call 'wild' - arrogant, immature, snobbish perhaps but not wild, not by the standards of most teenagers I know. Kimberley Nixon is one of the best young actors around (just watch Fresh Meat) but even she looks a little perplexed by the dreadful script and amateurish directing.Being English I am often dismayed at Hollywood's stereotyping of 'quaint' English characters and locations. This film is particularly bad in that respect and might as well have been shot on Mars with little green aliens. All the more disgraceful then that it is written and directed by two English people.The characters are one-dimensional and there is an overall immaturity about the production that means it could only really appeal to a very immature audience. Perhaps kids will like it, but adults really ought to avoid this drivel. Life is too short.",Wild Child

19,wrightiswright,Not a pleasant experience.,2,6 June 2018,"Oh look, another one of those movies that takes a potentially fascinating story (A preppy American teenage girl ends up at a stuffy English boarding school) and excretes all over it! Before setting in on fire, stamping on the remains and throwing it off a cliff. I'll leave you with that charming mental image, and move on.So, aside from the cardboard cutout characters, the unfunny jokes, the numerous pointless montages, a hugely obtrusive soundtrack and probably the most anodyne romance on record, what can I say about this movie?How about the fact that our sassy main heroine is far more preferable as a smart mouthed 'brat', than the dull conformist nicey-nice 'lady' she turned into later? She even enjoys lacrosse. Now, that's some serious brainwashing right there.How about the fact than at one point she has a makeover, 
and I'll fight anyone who says she looks better after than she did before? (If anything, I'd say one of her friends could do with an image transformation much more urgently than our lead: the one with the birds nest in bunches on her bonce).How about the fact that no-one in this film, with the possible exception of the straight-laced headmistress, talks or acts like anyone you've ever met? In fact, between the hilariously bad attempt at capturing English authenticity, and the grotesquely annoying mugging by the cast for (failed) comedy effect, it feels like far more of an endurance test than media where we should care about anything that happens.But wait! Don't go yet! We still have to see the big climax... which of course featured the humiliation of the school 'mean girl' and is set in a courtroom (just like everything else these days), followed by a 'sexy' haka during the final lacrosse game... plus the culmination of the whole 'will this poncy English twerp who I've fallen in love with after about three lines go out with me'.I was so excited I almost coughed up my own spleen.Some years ago now, I started watching Wild Child, only to give up a few minutes in because I knew it wasn't the film for me.Today, I literally got frogmarched into seeing it again, this time all the way through ""Oh, give it a chance, you'll like it! I swear!""By the time the movie was over, my co-watcher wasn't the only one swearing.Time to listen to my instincts more, methinks. 2/10",Wild Child
20,quiqueperezsoler,Deeper than it looks when you think about it. I'm not the target audience for this movie yet it spoke to me... In just one really well realised theme,7,13 April 2020,"Besides the whole teen comedy ""learn your lesson"" and culture clashing sort of gimmicks, I read a review about underrated teen movies of the 2000s and oddly enough this was one of them.At first I was surprised at the trailer because it was obvious it was a so-called ""chick flick"" so I assumed I wouldn't bother taking a look at it. But part of me wanted to see how they treated their representation of English girls and I also realised the screen writer was actually Lucy Dahl, daughter of acclaimed British novelist Roald Dahl. So after the reviewer said that underneath the very superficial fanciness, inappropriate ""objectifying"" of 14 year-olds (*yikes*) and over the top comedy facade there was a deeper story. To explain it this will require getting into SPOILERS so refer to the spoiler part down below.IN CONCLUSION, the movie has some funny moments but it never takes the jokes too far, it's like the movie is holding back for some reason. The premise has potential, the characters are quirky and interesting but the film chooses absurdity and over the top comedy instead of playing with the cards dealt like the english setting with an american girl, the boarding school dynamic and the characters' mischievous potential to wreak havok. It could have been a film with more layers to it and more to teach to young girls but it sort of misses the mark opting for a more ""barbie girl"" pretentious approach at everything (and not in a good way like ""Clueless(1995)"") instead of a more heartfelt one.-- BIG SPOILERS FROM HERE ON --""She's the spitting image of her mother, isn't she?""
I was pleasantly shocked at how the coping with the passed away mother was handled. Surprisingly amazed and actually pleased, it was heartwarming to see the changes she made to cope with her mom's death at the beginning and how she received an emotional and physical ""makeover"" (which actually was simply returning to her natural brunette hair). But it was more than that, there are several cues through out the movie that subtly hinted at some emotional unstability: the recklessness of jumping off the pool at her house, the having a therapist at that age, the way she treats everyone, the way she doesn't get bratty mad at her father when he leaves... This girl was really disturbed and was hiding underneath this superficial self. I have to say I kept watching to see how it all ended up. I swear if this movie had cared and developed more this aspect and had connected it more to the people around her it would have been a great uplifting moving about coping with the loss of a parent and staying true to one's self.And the few moments that were there were really endearing, when she found out about the picture and everyone felt sorry for her, when the love interest stopped her kiss wanting to know her better first instead (pretty good love interest I might add, and it didn't feel that forced actually, being the only guy in an all-girls school you'd think ""okay, I know who'll be the love interest"" but it actually was well realised, there's actually a reason for her to go after him, props to the writers) and when the father saw her play in the field and had that flashback moment of her mom, I don't know if it was because the actor really did a good job but man I almost teared up. Props to Emma Roberts and all the actors involved in all the emotional moments, they really were well acted.",Wild Child
21,brownah18,Wild yet more fun overall.,7,18 November 2009,"Emma Roberts is Poppy Moore and she has a problem with getting out of hand. So, it's her last straw and her father Gerry (Aidan Quinn) to a boarding school in England called Abbey Mount which was started in 1797. Poppy is greeted by Mrs. Kingsley (Natasha Richardson), who is the Head Mistress tells Poppy that she will try to make her experience less difficult than it should be. Matron (Shirley Henderson) plays sort of a nanny type character who keeps the girls in line and takes away their cell phones on the first day. People at the school don't follow Poppy's lingo which makes it rather funny to watch. Being bullied by the head girl Harriet (Georgia King) is always fighting with Poppy because she does not like her.Her friends in her room which includes a girl called Drippy (Juno Temple) who you might remember from Year One, help her to try and get expelled because she doesn't fit in. When Poppy finally figures out its not such a bad place because she has some good friends, a guy named Freddie (Alex Pettyfer) who likes her, and that her mother went to the same school she does not want to leave anymore.This movie is mostly a chick flick, but I've had my fair share of watching movies like this when it's hard to believe. Roberts character is done so well by her and she is funny and quick witted. I remember last seeing her in Nancy Drew, even then I knew she was going to be in more movies to come and grow with her career in acting. I'm sorry to say, but this was Natasha Richardson's last movie as it is sad to see her go. Married to Liam Neeson, in March 2009, she died suddenly, after falling and receiving a head injury whilst skiing in Mont Tremblant, Quebec, Canada. She will always be remembered and never forgotten.

I'm thankful she isn't sporting a fake tan and silicone!The teen movies in the 80s and 90s were quirky, oddball and over the top good fun. Yes, we live in a different age but do we really need to be subjected to leading characters who seem to actively evoke visions of ED???If you want to view a funny teen movie, watch Mean Girls or the Breakfast Club.",Wild Child

24,sam_aj_01,Wild Child?,5,18 August 2008,"From the title we really expect an outragous Wild Child but we get the complete opposite. I was hoping to see more of the LA themed lifestyle but we only saw this on the first 5 minutes. The school came into the film way to quickly, it was almost like skipping a few chapters. Later on in the film things were getting a little bit better although the characters were so annoying, it was frustrating to watch...It doesn't relate to many other films apart from St. Trinians. This film is different in its own sense of humour, but that gets boring after a while...I recommend this for a girlish slumber party, otherwise its a miss!",Wild Child
25,geoffgee,"Clever, funny, touching and entertaining (possible minor spoiler!).",8,23 August 2008,"This is a great film with lots of humorous dialogue, more than a few absolutely marvellous characters, a modicum of romance and also an exciting and dramatic climax towards the end. Acting and direction are excellent and there is a lot of enthusiasm from everyone involved. The dialogue is fast (I actually found it a little too fast for me to keep up with in places - but I'll catch up with what I missed when I see it again!) and there's plenty of it. I like films with plenty of dialogue and found what the girls were saying to be interesting. An example might be the way they had found ways to circumvent the school's rules, e.g. as regards their mobile phones. There is plenty of action and visual humour and a few touching bonding scenes - as well as some quieter and more introspective moments. I thoroughly recommend seeing this entertaining, thought-provoking, moving and most enjoyable film .",Wild Child
26,SophomoreSlump,Nonsensical. Silly. Entertaining.,7,15 December 2008,"Poppy (Roberts) is a spoiled rich Malibu teen who has gone too far after playing an over-the-top prank and making her dad (Quinn) snapped. Thus, deciding to send her to an English boarding school for girls. She is, of course, taken in as an outsider, becoming Harriet's (King), the School Head Girl, greatest nemesis in mere seconds. But the headmistress (Richardson) really would like to help her mend her ways. She bonds with her roommates (Nixon, Temple, Wu and Cocker), after a rough start and they agree to help her get expelled so that she could go back home. Of course, cliché as it may sound, these friendship and a crush on the headmistress' son, Freddie (Pettyfer), give her second thoughts.I can say that this move is like Mean Girls, except the girls aren't as mean. We get an American girl who's ignorant about all-thing Brit (and the other way around). Poppy came to the school overdressed, and thought that somebody will carry her bags for her, and was completely oblivious about the school hierarchy. You might think this is another fish-out-of-the-water type of film, but it's more than that.The movie is witty, fun, honest, and slightly intelligent enough to make it watchable. It's nothing new, but it's pretty entertaining.As the movie progresses, we see the character, mostly Poppy, develops. We get to learn why she is this ""wild child"" in the opening scene, and why she's so mean and ignorant about other people.It all get slightly predictable towards the end...everything comes crashing down, Poppy's friendship is heading for breaking point, Freddie is angry with what Poppy has done, and she is on the brink of being kicked out of the school. So she only gets on chance to make everything alright again. School movies will do better without this kind of scenes. Anyway, the ending is quite emotional and touching, it'll make up for the rest of the clichéd trip you take since the start of the movie.",Wild Child
27,fshardlow,'Wild Child' has always held a place in my chick-flick heart,9,5 May 2019,"The first time I watched this film I think I was about 12, must've been about 2012-ish. I watched it again today at 17 and I still felt the same love for 'Wild Child' five years on.I just really LIKE British (ish... I know she's American) films in general, I think us Brits really know how to make the most of our beautiful settings and brilliant actors. 'Wild Child' really has an amazing setting, from a grand stately home-like school to gorgeous seaside towns. I think what the film drops on in terms of a meaningful plot, they make up for with their beautiful settings.Also, the music! I feel like no one has mentioned how GREAT the soundtrack is! M.I.A.? Adele? Robbie Williams? I think 'Wild Child' might be the best 'chick flick' movie in terms of its soundtrack. Although this film was made over a decade ago, there's some songs that I still listen to now. It feels cool and current to this day.Emma Roberts also just makes me laugh with her bratty portrayal of Poppy. I love her character development and the whole cast is spot-on aswell.Just remember that this is a light-hearted movie. I wanted to watch it again to take a break from A-Level revision, not because I was expecting high-brow cinema.Give it a go, it's really fun.",Wild Child

If you are a teenage girl you may add one more star to each of my grades (making 'Angus' a perfect 4) because I am not the intended audience for any of these movies. The 'wild' characteristics of these movies are puerile. The girl in ""Wild Child"" is a slanted measurement of a teenager really going off-the-rails, of course, but that isn't what the movie is all about. This is a character who would risk falling to her death so that she could take time to cleanse the bacteria clinging to the skydiving equipment before pulling the chute. That is like so totally wild.Read the full review: http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/",Wild Child

32,GreyJug,Not that good,4,27 July 2020,"First of all, it is stupid to describe a person as ""wild'' when this term also is used to describe an animal. Second of all, the character of Poppy is not likeable. She seems unprincipled and it would be good if she was rebellious but still seemed very good natured, but she doesn't show any particular examples of being good natured. I don't hate her as a person, but nor can I think of many reasons to like her either. Her enemy Harriet is obnoxious and hard to like just like Poppy is, but Harriet is not awful enough for me to not feel a bit sorry for her when she is expelled from School. To make me feel gleeful about Harriet being expelled from School, she would have had to have been worse as a person than she is. Harriet is pompous, arrogant, bossy, obnoxious and Xenophobic, she insults the fact that Poppy is American but there isn't enough done to make Harriet hateable enough for me to be glad when she is expelled from School. Poppy is also obnoxious and seems arrogant too, she doesn't seem to show much understanding of anyone else or have very many good qualities if any, which makes me find both Harriet and Poppy very dislikeable, but neither of them bad enough for me to hate them. The ending of this film is made to seem like it is a happy one because Harriet was expelled but I feel a bit sorry for her. Alternatively, I'd have liked it if Harriet and Poppy were both flawed but likeable people who redeemed themselves at the end of this film and had happy endings but that doesn't happen either. When loads of girls lie that they were with Poppy when they were not, and one girl says ""I was'' loads of them repeat these words and it is boring because there is not enough different words being used then and it is stupid that none of these girls get into trouble for lying, even when Poppy did. Alex Pettyfer's acting is good in this film and sometimes it is funny. Also I like how Poppy at first tries to get expelled from a School and then doesn't want to which is a good storyline and some of the storyline and dialogue of this film is good. But it isn't a very good movie though.",Wild Child

34,KiteVega,Average film with a horrible message,4,24 December 2009,"It's not often that I get irked by a film that is so obviously supposed to be a brain dead feast for the eyes and nothing more - after all, I have given both Bratz and The House Bunny reasonably favourable reviews, based on the fact that they aren't supposed to be anything other than daft entertainment. Sadly, this film made me feel rather bilious, and I did try to like it, honest! (Again, I have given Bratz and The House Bunny fairly nice reviews, go figure!) As a girlie movie it's no big deal - it's average fare that comes across as an unhappy mash-up of Bratz, John Tucker Must Die and the new St Trinian's films. It's incredibly derivative, but what else did you expect? It's a path well trodden in teeny, tween girlie films - we have a heroine, a nasty girl baddie, a love interest, a well-meaning mentor, a parent driven to distraction, a group of loyal buddies...the list goes on. The story line is grating due to it being totally old hat and is made more irksome thanks to the bucket-loads of pathetic clichés - for example, while the British say stuffy old grace before chowing down on a plate of meat 'n' two veg, our American friends apparently favour a Buddhist chant before delicately picking at low-fat vegetarian entrées - and sadly the film is cursed with a hideous 'heroine', Poppy Moore, who is absolutely and utterly without charm - it is almost impossible to like her. She is rude, spoilt, screechy, whiny and confrontational: what a role model! OK, so in typical movie fashion she sees the error of her ways, but this revelation happens in the last twenty minutes of the film, by which time you detest her to the point of No Return. What was most upsetting about this film is the truly awful message it gives to young girls. We've seen the slutty clothes and raunchy dancing etc etc in the likes of Mean Girls, but that film was infinitely superior because of the way it lambasted this behaviour. It showed it up as being laughable, ridiculous and totally unwholesome without ever seeming preachy, and what a fantastic cult movie Mean Girls still is. Wild Child makes behaviour like this seem desirable, and does so to revolting aplomb in a fairly short scene (the fact that this was possible just goes to show there was some intelligence behind the movie). The scene in question is at the school social - boys will be there, so the gals get themselves dressed up as 'slutty and available' as possible (a direct quote from the film). We are then treated to Poppy (who is only meant to be 16, remember) thrashing herself around to the strains of hip-hop music, dressed in next to nothing while being ogled by a smörgåsbord of leering teenage boys. The House Bunny was nothing on this - at least it was an obvious joke, and the characters were all adults. This film tells teenage girls, in no uncertain terms, that the way to be popular and desirable is to wear as little as possible and bust moves like a lap dancer. Not a nice message at all. This one scene really tainted a film that, otherwise, I could have quite enjoyed on a fairly moronic level. But it's clear message - that every guy loves a tramp - was just too much for me, and erased any other heartfelt message that might have come across.",Wild Child

Children may not appreciate the large amount of bad language and rebellious natures used by some of the actors, while adults may find the film childish and a way to encourage bad behaviour. Personally, the first time I watched the film it took me a while to warm up to it, but I was entertained by it enough to remain sat down with my eyes on the screen at all times. After I watched it a couple of times, I put it on the DVD shelf and forgot about it. The plot is a bit dragging and over-the-top in some places with the characters being dramatic and a bit too cocky to find humerus, but the film is pretty good and I would watch it again.",Wild Child

The film itself had some good moments. I've never known girls of that age to really get up to what they were doing in the whole film. I think I preferred Emma Roberts in We're the Millers. The head girl character didn't stand out for me at all. I guess you could say that it was very over acted and didn't seem realistic at all. Now if you would like to see a convincing head girl/boy then I suggest you look at Percy Weasley in Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets. His version of that sort of character is much more realistic than the actress that played this character. Suitable for girls that love rebelling against their elders.",Wild Child

I'm not really into teen movies these days, because I feel that all of them seem to be the same. But not this one though it was edgy then most teen movies. I even love the name she has in this movie and the crap she does at the beginning is funny.I love how her sister is like oh now you have done it Poppy its so cute and she could really care less.This movie even has real message on how the environment you are raised in and the people you surround yourself with plays a big part on who you are or who you can become. Also how one parent sometimes could use a little help, because if you have a spouse your kid doesn't like it could cause a lot a problems when it comes to respect.

I had never seen anything with Emma Roberts before and after this certainly never will. OK, as a rule it's a hard act for Americans to compete with English actors, remember colourless Andie McDowell in Four weddings"". E. R. may be talented, well, I doubt it. She shows just one facial expression, to distract from which fact she is flashing about her skinny white legs and freakishly pointy knees. She looks totally bland and forgettable, especially in that horribly obvious blond wig in the first half, in no way prettier than her English counterparts. And since when is being a Californian particularly exotic? But the story's pretty boy falls for her almost at once, oh yeah. She doesn't even have to play hard to get, au contraire. Actually not even a better actress, say a young Jennifer Aniston, could have saved this horrible story. There is the obligatory dressing up scene – Roberts's aunt had a legendary one in ""Pretty Woman"", but whereas erstwhile prostitute Julia/Vivien emerged as an elegant lady, Emma/Poppy goes from spoilt brat in super-high heels to pole dancer-prostitute look-and-act-alike.

For those expecting a tween film like What A Girl Wants this is not it! There's a lot of swearing, sexual reference and drinking which is more like the kind of things normal 16 year olds do.

There's some promising new talent, good laughs and sweet lines in this delightfully cheesy romantic comedy.It's about a stereotypical Malibu Princess who annoys her father one too many times, resulting in her being sent away to an English Boarding school (much to her horror - the rain, the rain!). The film pretty much centers around her trying to get expelled from the school, and therefore sent back to LA with her father and sister. The film is about her journey from spoilt brat to English Boarding school-girl. If you're into Rom Coms and you're between 12 & 19 years of age I would definitely recommend this one for a good night in with the girls.+ there's some magnificent Alex Pettyfer moments ;)JUST WANT TO ADD - That there have been many complaints (mostly from British girls - of which I am) about the way British girls are portrayed in this film, but please rethink this and look at how Americans are treated! Our main character starts as a lying, self obsessed and vain brat and her best friend Ruby (American) proceeds to steal her boyfriend and backstab her!

It is about an American troublemaker, Poppy Moore, who is sent to an all girls boarding school in England. At first, all she wants is to escape from the school. However, after a while she begins to fit in with the other girls and realises how much she wants to stay. It is an emotional story about respect, trust and friendship. Emma Roberts portrays the character of Poppy Moore very well, and all the actors play their characters perfectly. This draws you into the film making it more enjoyable and you get a feel for what the characters are really feeling. You also begin to love Poppy as she is a very interesting character and as the nicer side of her begins to show.Overall this is a great movie. It's definitely a film to watch.",Wild Child

It's very early 2000s and occasionally outdated but brilliant in its own right.

50,silver_linings,Fairly Entertaining,6,27 October 2008,"If you're my age, you'd mostly thinks that I'm crazy for even watching the movie and writing a comment for it. But, I've thought about it and decided, why not? I came across this movie by accident, I never followed the entertainment world since I left High School, it's not that important in my book. I was at first skeptical, that I must admit. Still, I am glad I looked pass that and went on to watch the entire movie. The movie is, first, definitely not any Oscar or any award material. It's just some feel good movie. Something that makes you laugh and wanted to hate the villain. It's done fairly well in my book. Though to me, Emma Roberts looked too much like she's trying to ""Addie Singer""-ed the role (yes I did watch Unfabulous, I have young cousins) and turned it Malibu. From where I stand, I think Ms Roberts could have done better, but she's young, I suppose there are time to learn. Alex Pettyfer aren't too bad, but seeing I've watched Strombreaker, I couldn't stop seeing him as ""Alex Rider"" just yet. He's a little stiff, but pleasant.Frankly, if you're expecting some high roll movie, and have too much of an expectations, you would be disappointed. However, if you look at the movie just as another work of art, you'd find it fairly enjoyable. It's not exactly a masterpiece nor is it going to put the actors on the map of the world, but if you really thought about it, you could possibly see those characters around you, in the people you know in your life or the ones in Hollywood. It's funny, not too dramatic, sweet, slightly eccentric and somewhat charming in its own way. Though, seriously, can anyone stop comparing places and schools in England to Hogwarts? ""What's this? Hogwarts"" -- That line, the movie would have been better off without it. And overall, the movie is not too bad; moderate acting skills, slightly predictable storyline and not a bad movie to watch every now and then to take your mind of 'seriousness'.",Wild Child

I don't have a fine taste in movies and I'm not that much of a snob. at first I was like ""why am I watching this"" but I went on because ""it may get better later"". it didn't. it was very cringy and there wasn't that much of plot. at first I didn't know who was more annoying, if harriet or poppy. and btw who the hell is called poppy????????? then she changed and she was fine, but just that, fine. they could've gotten deeper into her relationship with freddy too. we get just 2/4 scenes. and that dance she makes at the social ?????? that was definitely bullying material I'm sorry. what finally made me think ""I've waisted 1.40 hours for this ????"" was that haka scene.

The film has an incredibly predictable storyline, the acting isn't great, most of it complete and utter non-sense and most of events in the film hold little to no purpose.I've gave it a high rating, however, because I don't think I've laughed quite as much at a film as I have at this one for a long, long time. I think the phrase 'so genius it's bordering on madness' applies here: the film isn't good, but that's where it succeeds. It's one of those films that aren't meant to be taken seriously, and as such you can just relax, and have a laugh. I spent a good hour or so crying of laughter, and I could't even catch my breath during the ""I'm Spartacus"" motif in the 'Honour Court' -- unintended comedy genius.While it's no Space Odyssey and has less character depth in the entire film than is seen in one minute of A Clockwork Orange, it is nevertheless worth the watch.",Wild Child

The soundtrack also contains many popular hits that me and my friends love. Emma Roberts plays her character Poppy fantastically and really shows her development throughout the film. Having a good looking lead boy also helps. ""Wild Child"" really conveys the struggles of teenage years for example the love story between Poppy, the Head Girl and Freddie, the headmistress' son.

And another thing about this movie is It's more real life than other movies I've seen like how characters behave kind of things and of course the movie casting Director had done a awesome job because the Actors and actresses fits well to the characters you'll definitely fell that when you are watching ""Wild Child"" movie.

Of course, in this case, it's ""don't judge a movie by its cover"". On the outside, this movie just looks like any random teen girly drama/romance film. But, when you actually watch it, it's quite different. Some of the things I liked about Wild Child is that the actors and actresses really did a good job on this. They demonstrated perfectly the goal of acting--not to ACT LIKE your character, but to BE the character. Although in the beginning of this movie, Poppy is not a kind of girl any parent would want their child to follow, she becomes ""better"" when at Abbey Mount. This movie has many themes, and among them are ""true friends will always stand up for you, no matter what"" (referring to the Honor Court scene)and ""when stuck in any situation, make the best out of it, and it will go a long way."" (referring to Poppy's overall journey throughout the year--at first she hates Abbey Mount, but then she gets to know everybody better and doesn't think it's so bad. Then at the end, she actually is happy when she gets to stay.) But no movie is wholly enjoyable--in this case, with the movie Wild Child, there are some things parents sometimes do not want their child to see, like swear words. There are a few bad words (not a lot though) in this movie, and also some other material only suitable for older kids. Anyone who is interested in drama and romance movies with a cheeky but touching story would LOVE the Wild Child movie.",Wild Child

It could actually be fun if it were not because the film actually takes itself seriously!!
There is one fun thing about it, though, the title in Spanish: ""Megapetarda"". It really is such title that captures the full stupidity of the main character. It´s difficult to translate in its full meaning, but it would be a mix of Mega dumb, mega unsufferable, pseudo posh American spoiled brat.",Wild Child
58,im_a_werewolf,A Purposely used cliché,8,5 July 2013,"When i got this movie,i was thinking ""Emma Roberts,eh?Probbably something 10 year old' would watch..""Then,i started watching.It was a funny movie,and mostly cliché,in which when poppy's best friend Ruby cheats with her boyfriend,Ronny.And of course when the whole school almost burns down.But ,by the time it was over,i was already laughing at how they used everything into one big ball of over exaggerated clichés,which in this case are hilarious!Starting off,poppy More is not wanting her dads girlfriend to move in ,so shes takes it to far by throwing all of her stuff in a lake by their house,which sets off her dad into making her start school in a boarding school in London,in which she finds friends,enemies,her decease mom,and love.",Wild Child
59,benrat-50434,One word. Perfection.,10,21 December 2019,"This film, this masterpiece of cinema, will truly go down in history as motion pictures most controversial and thought provoking adventures. From the daughter of Roald Dahl, Lucy Dahl, it is clear that the Dahl family lineage is in safe hands.The classic family comedy is performed with such elegance and magnificence that my family died while watching it. Even the family pet, our dog Poppy (named after the main character of a piece of classic cinematography), exploded while watching it!Truly an amazing work. 11/10!",Wild Child
60,dlcicconi,"Great fun, except for the lead actress, Emma Roberts.",7,20 April 2021,"I really loved the idea of the bratty teen from Malibu getting her comeuppance from the down-to-earth girls' school students in Britain. While the writing was a bit off, everyone gives their roles a fun turn, but Roberts seems lifeless and just going through the motions. She has a few good moments where she actually engaged, but all around just so miscast. This could have been so much better. Just compare her performance to Aidan Quinn, who plays her father, and gives the role even more than called for. Kimberly Nixon as Kate and Alex Pettyfer as Freddie outshone her so much it was like a different movie when they were on screen. And I found it so sad that this was Natasha Richardson's last role before her untimely death. She is lovely here and very missed.So I would recommend this film for all the others in it. I have not followed Emma Roberts career in the last 13 years but I will give her the benefit of the doubt that she has improved since Wild Child.",Wild Child
61,sagerman4,Strange Movie,5,10 December 2008,"I had never heard of this movie when I...acquired it...so I did not know what to expect. After a few minutes, I believed that I had predicted the rest of the movie based on some other movies that seemed to resemble this one; however, I found that it was somewhat different than the others of its genre: none of the other movies like this one have made me dislike the protagonist of the movie so much. Throughout the entire movie, she never won me back over, and I don't think she was supposed to.If the writers intended this, then it is kind of interesting and I may watch it again. If it was unintended, then it just sucked. This confusion is why I gave it a 5.I was just wondering if anyone else was in this particular quandary.",Wild Child
62,o-tadpole,Complete Fluff - But Good Fluff,10,1 September 2008,"Alex Pettyfer's Fit.It's more realistic than most movies like this in terms of alcohol and sex. Though it's not rude, just clever. The worst they say is the S word.It's nice watching beautiful people have fun.There are some funny moments.It's always awesome watching people get what they deserve.what's brilliant about this movie is that they know they won't get anything for it so they know they can just mess around, the only minor problem is that you know what's going to happen to Poppy the minute she starts an Email and a friend reminds her to sign off.Alex Pettyfer's so smoking it doesn't matter though.It won't win Oscars but it's sufficiently clever to entertain a 12-19 year old in the school holidays =]",Wild Child
63,caersai,Not bad at all,7,6 October 2008,"Wild Child may be predictable, but what it lacks in substance it makes up in character evolution. It is your basic wild child gets sent away and becomes reformed type of movie, but there lies a deeper meaning hidden in this movie. The poster before me recommended this to children, and I can't help but wonder if that poster was a teen him/herself. Adults will enjoy this movie more than teenagers; teenagers rarely understand coming-of-age movies as they have yet to experience it.Wild Child is most assuredly a predictable movie, but don't let that stop you. It's also very heartwarming, charming, and may bring a tear to your eye. See it.",Wild Child
64,chrisbond007,Not Very Good At All,1,20 August 2008,"I went to watch this film expecting some girls that would be good to watch but instead of that it was the most predictably and basic storyline i have ever seen. I would not recommend that you watch it. If you are about 11 and a GIRL NOT A BOY then it might not be a bad film to watch You may enjoy it. It is a very long film and if it is not your type of film then i would not recommend even thinking about going to see it. I think, this may not be true, but i think it could possibly do you harm going to watch it because of the amount of boring material in the film. Can someone else please tell me if they agree or do not agree with what i have put. Thanks.",Wild Child

66,meganpinches-1,Wild Child is utterly amazing!!!!!!,10,28 December 2008,"I absolutely love this movie. I have seen it 4 times in the past 7 days and could easily watch it again right now. The lines are hilarious like, ""Look, I didn't start it, it wasn't my fault and if this was America I would sue!"" It has got to be the movie of the century! Emma Roberts takes an extremely good part and makes the whole movie fantastic! The characters created and then shaped by the actors enhance the movie and it's emotional response! It's absolutely amazing. If you haven't seen it you should watch it, ""now!"" It has funny lines and really emotional scenes. It takes you on a journey with Poppy Moore experiencing the situations she is exposed to. Everyone can seem to connect with this movie and I for one am engulfed by it and in awe of it every time I see it. People will be repeating it's lines for years to come! It's the best movie EVER!!",Wild Child
67,barlow-nicholas,"Mindless, pointless, low-intelligence 'chick-flick'",4,6 January 2009,"Anyone who gave this more than 5 out of 10 needs to rethink their approach to movies. So far from being 'the best movie EVER!!!', it's not the worst but be prepared that you won't get any 'deep characterisation' here, rather hackneyed stereotypes and irritating characters and an extremely predictable storyline. Of course, it's pointless really criticising this film as if you like movies about teenage girls and snobby as hell American bitches being 'transformed' into caring human beings, then you'll like it. If you like movies with depth, characterisation, feeling, or good acting, then go see something else. If you want a mindless, pointless flick that might possibly make you forget the dreadful state the world is in for a bit more than an hour, then I guess this is as good as any.",Wild Child
68,qwertyoct,So what's it gonna be? Evening or Wild Child?,7,22 March 2009,"Okay, this may sound a bit morbid, but either this or 'Evening' are destined to become a classic.The last two films that Natasha Richardson completed, and in the circumstances, one is bound to become a classic - I am personally routing for Evening.This is an OK film - not great - but okay, Roberts and Pettyfer try their hardest, but it's a fairly attractive script, but with a weak director helming it - the results are not as they should be.In comparison to the likes of 10 Things I Hate About You, She's All That and Cruel Intentions which excelled in this sub-genre of Teen Flicks, this doesn't stand much of a chance - sorry!",Wild Child
69,matty_is_parked,Awesome,1,22 April 2009,"Its really good.. Spend ur money on this film!! It is one of those movies that you have to watch over and over again. Money well spent. definitely worth watching with your partner. it is romantic and very funny. I almost wet my pants!! If you are looking for a movie, probably one of the greatest ever made, well than this is definitely for you.. And i love it when the movie finish, how it just replays itself for ur convinience. Saves me the trouble of having to press play on the remote again.. So inconclusion, made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Acting, first class. Story line original and the ending was so unpredictable it had me in tears. Who wuda thought her mother went to that school, even though it says it at the start of the movie. A well earned 1 star!!",Wild Child
70,rphillips-18,Light Hearted FUN,7,14 June 2009,"Come on folks, lighten up here.Yes... This isn't a deep and meaningful piece of classic cinema... It is a fun ""just sit back and have a good grin"" film.I'm afraid that people who get on their high horse about films like this must have gone to the wrong cinema! I am male, in my 40's, have a degree and run my own company... I watched this together with my two daughters (14 and 16) and we all had great fun and a few really good laughs. So no... you don't have to be a 12 year old girl to find something fun in this film!It is predictable, cheesy and the plot is VERY shallow and weak in most places... But you can't expect more from a film like this.So if you want to watch this, just turn off your high-brow film critic existence, grab some popcorn and a fizzy drink and have a smile...",Wild Child
71,piamartine,I love this movie!,8,9 May 2015,"Wild Child is, in many ways, a typical teenage girl movie. A pretty girl, a pretty boy, a nemesis, and a bunch of girlfriends who giggle over boys and clothes. It has ups and downs, and a happy ending. (This is my ""spoiler"". As this is my first review on here, I don't really know what qualifies as a spoiler, but, just to be sure..) It is very predictable, yet surprising at times. The first time I watched this movie, I could basically tell what was going to happen next at all times, and I wasn't very impressed. But I couldn't help but watching it over and over and over again, and now I can safely say that it's one of my absolute favorites. It's funny, silly, cool, a little dark, and absolutely heart-warming. I really recommend seeing this on a bad night, it will certainly cheer you up! (Sorry for my bad English)",Wild Child
72,kirsty-croissant,"A good laugh for a stereotypical ""teen"" movie",6,4 February 2012,"I was rather surprised with this movie, of course it's not going to be remembered for the best storyline or best acting, but hopefully it will be remembered for it's witty humor.The storyline doesn't have much depth and the dialogue is rather predictable, but even so, it'll still be able to squeeze a few laughs out of you. I was expecting some teen movie about a spoilt brat who gets turned around and is expecting everyone watching this to change their life's perspective, but given that the first word in this movie is a swear word, I somehow didn't expect that anymore.It's perfect for a laugh, nothing more, nothing less, good for a girly night or something along those lines.",Wild Child
73,elizabethcusack,Meh,5,6 January 2019,"Very cheesy, lots of cringe. If you have some time to spare or just need a good Emma Robert's fix, this might be able to tide you over.",Wild Child
74,chandana-cupcake,Light hearted Teen flick,9,25 September 2013,"Wild child is a very wonderful teen movie with a awesome story line...This film is full of cheesy goodness. If you are looking for a young chick flick with a dash of romance, this one is a great choice.There were a lot unexpected twists in this movie that made it more than your regular romcomThe movie has a superb cast ,Emma roberts has done a great job I really had a great time watching it.Its a balance of Fun,Romance,Drama & Emotions .... Starting form a rich spoil brat the story then focus on the girls bonding & how they stand by each other along with there pranks & plots,Later how they have to face the consequences for there doings,realization and a lovely ending..",Wild Child
75,davidl-901-74508,"Dull, generic & cringey to watch",2,11 June 2016,"There is nothing particularly special about the story, very generic and predictable. A lot of dialogue was so utterly cringe worthy particularly from the protagonists 'British' friends, their performance was cardboard at lot of the time,I'm not sure what accent they are meant to have, I've never heard anyone anywhere in Britain sound anything like that, not even those from An upper class background, also the terminology they used is very peculiar, For example they used horridious when Horrendous would have fitted better, and not sure what hurrious is meant to mean as it does not appear to be a real word or slang. Despite these faults I presume Teenage girls probably not from Britain may enjoy this film As they may not recognize the faults.",Wild Child
76,Brian-williams80,"Georgia King steals ""Wild Child""",2,3 September 2014,"I saw Wild Child recently and I felt Georgia King as head girl Harriet Bentley stole the film. This was King's first feature film and I think she has quickly developed into a very talented actress. The film's treatment of Harriet made me feel sympathy for her; She was clearly insecure though highly ambitious, competitive and a bully yet the ""Honor Court"" scene with her imploding; ranting hate and jealously at Poppy resulting in her humiliation and expulsion was for me this otherwise mediocre films most powerful moment. The end scene of Harriet being turned on by her formerly loyal friends added to this feeling of unease; Was Harriet really such a vile monster or like Poppy a teenage girl with her own issues and problems? It can be argued that Harriet was an unpleasant person but was Poppy really so different? I don't think putting Harriet's face and contact number onto a phone sex line was remotely amusing yet Poppy is seen as ""nice"" as opposed to the ""bad"" Harriet. Wild Child for me would have been a much better, more uplifting film if Harriet had ""earned"" Poppy's respect through apology and redemption.",Wild Child
77,menipappastoronto,This was so fun!,7,25 April 2018,"Ok so this movie was so much fun to watch! Don't let the average review stray you away from watching this! It was light hearted, made me laugh and smile. Of course it was one of those predictable story lines and chessy at times but sometimes these are just the types of movies you need. It brought me back to when I was younger and I loved it.",Wild Child
