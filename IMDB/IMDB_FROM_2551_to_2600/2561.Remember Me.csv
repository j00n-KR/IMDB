0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as bad as I was led to believe, but it didn't do much for me either",5,19 July 2011,"While I don't consider Remember Me a good movie, I don't consider it a bad one either, it's much better than I have heard critics make it out to be. I am indifferent to the Twilight Franchise but liked Water for Elephants(all with Robert Pattinson) so I wasn't expecting much in general. Actually the acting wasn't bad at all, in fact it was pretty darn good. Although I wasn't entirely crazy about his character, Pattinson is surprisingly good and he does show some believable chemistry with the lovely Emile De Ravin, while Pierce Brosnan is excellent. The film looks very nice too, with lovely cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is fitting and affecting. The direction is also better than expected. However the script is clichéd and weak at times, and I just couldn't connect to the characters or the story. Pattinson's character especially was tiresome to watch, and the story is rather dull and predictable with some scenes such as the ending coming across as manipulative. In conclusion, not bad, not good, just a sort of shrug. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Remember Me
1,SnoopyStyle,shock reveal,5,10 September 2016,"In 1991, Ally Craig and her mother are confronted by two teenage robbers in a deserted Brooklyn subway stop. Her mother is shot dead and she's left with only her police detective father Neil (Chris Cooper). Ten years later, Tyler Keats Hawkins (Robert Pattinson) is a self-destructive college kid. His friend Aidan Hall drags him out to party and they get into a fight. Neil is their arresting officer. Later, Aidan discovers Neil's daughter Ally (Emilie de Ravin) and he convinces Tyler to break her heart. Tyler hates his businessman father Charles (Pierce Brosnan) who is divorced from his mother Diane Hirsch (Lena Olin). His sister Caroline is a child artist but she gets picked on at school. The family is estranged after the oldest son's suicide.Pattinson is good as tortured soul leading man and Emilie de Ravin is a beautiful heroine. The two of them work great as a romantic team. I wanted to punch his best friend in the face every time he opens his really annoying mouth. The big concept in this movie is the shock reveal in the end. While there has been enough time past, it is still too awkward to have that incident used as a plot device. Maybe in another 50 years, this would be acceptable but it does feel wrong right now.",Remember Me
2,kosmasp,Memories,7,7 October 2010,"A drama like this will split quite a few people. Having Robert P. as the main character will only multiply that by quite a bit. There is the people who would watch anything with him in it and of course there is the people who cannot watch him anymore (after his Twilight role). The question of course, if this will play a role in the future, say in a few years, when many will probably have forgotten about Twilight and will it cloud their judgment (in either direction)? I can only talk for what it does now. And it does tell a really interesting story. It is slow moving and yes it will not affect all people in the same way. It will be obvious from the beginning if you are able to enjoy this ... if you have doubts after 10 minutes, you might as well stop watching. But if you bear with it, you will watch a really good movie. Robert and Twilight put aside ...",Remember Me
3,gavin6942,"Not Flawless, But Far Better Than You'd Expect",7,13 March 2010,"A woman is murdered on a New York City subway platform in 1991, and is later revealed to be the mother of a young girl who had witnessed this murder, named Ally Craig (Emilie de Ravin). Ten years later, Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson) is a rebellious 22 year old living in New York City and attending New York University. He has had a strained relationship with his businessman father, Charles (Pierce Brosnan), since his brother's suicide.Roger Ebert, surprisingly, generally liked the film, giving it three out of four stars and calling it a ""well-made movie. I cared about the characters. I felt for them. Liberate them from the plot's destiny, which is an anvil around their necks, and you might have something"" but goes on to say it ""tries to borrow profound meaning, but succeeds only in upstaging itself so overwhelmingly that its characters become irrelevant"". This is true, but I felt it played into the underlying message Ally had about experiencing the good before something bad possibly happens.Most reviews, however, were negative. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a ""shameless contraption of ridiculously sad things befalling attractive people"". Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe commented that the film ""crassly repurposes tragedy to excuse its clichés."" I accept the film has plenty of clichés -- a great many romantic comedies and ""chick flicks"" have had instances of guys dating girls under false pretenses, only to be inevitably discovered later. But I find this forgivable in that this film made a much more serious attempt without any of the humor, and the romance was only one of the plots.I think the stand-out actor here is not Robert Pattinson. Yes, many reviews have called this his breaking out from ""Twilight"" and his move into ""Rebel Without a Cause"" territory. But, despite his hard-fighting, drinking, smoking image, Pattinson's range seems to be rather small, as he was not substantially different from his Edward Cullen persona. Likewise, Emilie de Ravin, while more central here than on ""Lost"", could have had her role played by anyone. The real winner was Ruby Jerins, who played Caroline Hawkins, Tyler's little sister. She was given an emotional role to fill, and did it with ease -- I never felt for Tyler or Ally, but Caroline had it hard.The film is far from perfect. Too many scenes seemed out of focus, the camera was very shaky, and for some reason there were many instances where the rooms were bathed in a blue light. I'd blame Summit Entertainment, as they similarly give ""Twilight"" poor lighting, but as we've seen with ""The Hurt Locker"", ""Push"", and ""Knowing"", they are capable of making decent directorial decisions (however much say they actually have in the matter). The director here, Allen Coulter (""Hollywoodland""), left something to be desired.I had low expectations walking into this one and thought I would be walking out laughing at its shortcomings. In all fairness, I was wrong. Within ten or fifteen minutes I saw they were making a real effort and had a success on their hands. I left the theater impressed and with a new respect for Pattinson... I don't know if he has a future, but if he does this was his first step.",Remember Me
4,edwagreen,Remember Me-Thought Provoking Well Done ***1/2,9,1 May 2012,"There is plenty of trouble in this film.That being said, definitely stick with it. It is one of the most thought provoking films that I've seen in years.The first 20 minutes or so, there seems to be a definite disconnect here. Once the disconnect becomes connected, we have a terrific picture about two people, her mother was murdered in front of her and her father is a police officer. He lost a 22 year old brother who committed suicide. The parents broke up and the father seems to love his children, but is indifferent when it counts.Robert Pattinson is the intelligent terribly confused surviving brother and in a complete change of role for him, Pierce Brosnan is the indifferent father. Chris Cooper, who once one an Oscar, is the police officer, still reeling from his wife's killing and his inability to control his daughter ten years after the heinous crime.When the Pattinson character is arrested during a brawl, by a quirk of fate, he soon meets Cooper's daughter. Cooper had arrested him.The film centers around the fact that life is so fragile and complex. The 9/11 tragedy comes into play here.You will really come away that life must be lived to its fullest and that you must care about each other.",Remember Me
5,FlashCallahan,what a movie....,9,2 May 2011,"I had no intention of seeing this film, due to the fact that I knew in cinemas, all the twi-hards would be going, look at thim smoking, look at him drinking, Edward would never get a tattoo.The people who think that Pattinson IS Cullen, and would play him in every movie from now until his fame lapses. But it's a tremendous movie, with some fantastic performances by all, but full of tragedy and a gloomy feel throughout.With this movie, Pattinson has probably saved himself from a Mark Hamill type career, hopefully he will be remembered not just for that franchise, but for choosing subject matter that could probably confuse his core fan-base (he can walk in sunlight?) The plot is simple, boy gets arrested, dates cops daughter for a dare, falls in love, whilst being the bad apple of the family. His brother killed himself, and now his hather (played brilliantly by Brosnan) has built a wall of criticism between himself and Pattinson.It does go through the romantic drama mill a little, but thats just standard stuff for a movie like this.But I was rewarded for not wanting to no anything about this, I never read any reviews or any press about it, so i wasn't aware or prepared for the ending. I knew it wasn't going to turn out good for Pattinson, because he made up with his dad, stood up for his sister, and smiled, but the way the ending was executed, wasn't in bad taste, or tacked on to shock, I feel the film could not have ended in any other way.If you haven't seen the film, and have never read anything about it, due to the fact that Pattinson is in it, swallow your pride, and the fact that your girlfriend may swoon at the sight of him, and watch it, you will be treated to one of the most romantic films ever made.",Remember Me
6,gradyharp,Witnessing Death: Consequences,9,30 November 2010,"REMEMBER ME is a film whose story seems headed in one direction but then has the courage to fly the audience into an unexpected realm. Writer Will Fetters has created a story that will likely remained married to the memories of everyone who views this film - such is the impact and lessons of the last moments of the movie. Director Allen Coulter has gathered a fine cast of actors who are able to translate this lesson in facing death with a great deal of credibility and aplomb. As the film opens in 1991 in New York's subway a mother and child await their train: the mother is played by Martha Plimpton, the daughter Alyssa by Caitlyn Rund. In a senseless situation the mother is murdered by ruffians, observed by Alyssa and promptly the father, police Sgt Craig (Chris Cooper), arrives on the scene to take his terrified daughter home. Jump forward 10 years and we meet disshelved Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson) and his alcoholic roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington) who after a bar brawl are taken to jail by none other than Sgt Craig. Tyler's distant father is the wealthy Charles Hawkins (Pierce Brosnan) who bails them out of jail. Aidan suggests revenge at the beating they received from Sgt Craig in the form of having Tyler date and dump Craig's daughter Alyssa (now Emilie de Ravin). The two meet, spar, and fall in love in a genuine way: Tyler confesses to Alyssa his dark memory of seeing his brother hang himself and Alyssa shares being present when her mother was murdered. Tyler's only connection with his family now is his devotion to his eleven-year-old sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins) and his now divorced mother (Lena Olin). Through a series of unhappy incidents the story moves from coping with past memories of death and the consequences of the impact on each of the characters of the film. And just when it looks as though the film may have a happy an unexpected trauma occurs - one that changes the lies of every character. The cast is excellent down to the smallest role. The lighting and music and cinematography are all first rate. This is a movie that will creep under your skin and stay there as a reminder of how love, death and redemption affects us all in such a variety of ways. Grady Harp",Remember Me
7,deloudelouvain,For a romance drama it is a good movie,7,3 May 2016,Drama/romances are normally not the kind of movies I would go for. Especially not one where Robert Pattinson would figure in because I absolutely hated the hype around Twilight. But I gave it a shot anyway. And I have to admit that for a drama/romance Remember Me isn't bad. I won't watch it a second time or so but I'm still glad I watched it once. The storyline is easy and pleasant to follow with good acting as well. I thought the whole cast did a good job. The relationship between Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin is entertaining to watch as well as the twisted relationship between the father played by Pierce Brosnan and his son played by Robert Pattison. His little sister played by Ruby Jerins is a talented actress for her age. She already did a great job in the series Nurse Jackie and here she confirms that she will be a great actress in the future. All in all I enjoyed the movie even though it's not the movie I would go for.,Remember Me
8,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Remember Me,6,19 March 2010,"I suppose the major buzz generated for this film, is whether Robert Twilight Pattinson can act outside of Edward, the lovelorn, pasty white face vampire. To me though, it seems that he can't escape from being stereotyped now, and all the more so as long as he continues to play brooding, teenage characters with plenty of angst that need to be released. If anyone is to think Keanu Reeves only has one expression, then Robert Paattinson looks close to become heir apparent.Remember Me though was saved by the curveball that got thrown in the last 10 minutes of the film. I had expected it to spiral somewhere, because it started out quite bleak and without hope in the relationships of its characters, but had inched toward an all's well that end's well track in no uncertain terms, until Will Fetters' story decided to lay down the emotional impact. It treaded for the most parts at being an emotional family soap opera that just hovered around without going anywhere, before that emotional sucker punch that on one hand may seem gimmicky, but on the other was excellent in effectively wrapping the story up in one fell swoop.It's a romantic story centering around Pattinson's angry Tyler Hawkins and his lover Ally Craig, played by Emilie de Ravin, and their respective families which have suffered and are still not quite over with the pain of tremendous loss. For the Hawkins, it's to deal with the loss of their son/brother, and for the Craigs, a senseless murder in the first scene that Ally as a child had to bear witness to. Different upbringing meant different ways at expressing one's pain, and for Tyler, he's onto this self-destructive mode until Ally, who has moved on in life in calmer terms, enters his life. Then it's more romancing and plenty of drama when characters clash, though with some scenes (such as the angry sex one that the censors and distributors here agreed on snipping it off) that made it look pretty out of place, or at times contrived.In essence it dealt with how people show emotions, and their respective dealing with pain and loss. Love gets expressed in many different ways, some explicitly in verbal terms but ringing hollow emotionally, and others through the responsibility of making sure that their loved ones are financially free, hence the sacrifices made on a relations level. Patinson though only managed to brood with cigarette hanging on lips. or smirk a lot when events unfurl in a manner agreeable with him, and looks very much immature when paired up against Emilie de Ravin's more powerful performance.Allen Coulter's film also had its star studded cast to thank in carrying the film through, even though most like Lena Olin and Pierce Brosnan had bit parts, with the latter looking quite un- Bond like with the added paunch around the waist to play a filthy rich man who had sacrificed close family relations for the pursuit of material success. Chris Cooper didn't manage to bring anything more to the table than that of an NYPD cop doggedly tracking down his daughter, or to dish out some severe punishment. The scene stealer had instead gone to child actor Ruby Jerins as the little girl Caroline Hawkins, an art prodigy who is trying to reach out to an emotionally distant dad.As mentioned, if not for the way this film had ended, Remember Me would have become just another misnomer of a title.",Remember Me
9,namashi_1,Wasted...,2,14 May 2010,"Allen Coulter's 'Remember Me' is wasted. A good idea that doesn't translate into a good film. 'Remember Me' is depressing, for some reason. It's sad because it has to be, and why call it 'Remember Me'? There's no head and toe of this film.'Remember Me' is about sad characters... each are depressed in some way and are hardly happy. The film has a tepid start, a happening middle and a unwanted end. Why bring 9/11 in the scene? Why should the HERO die? Coulter's direction is weak, screenplay by Will Fetters is non-happening.In the acting department, Robert Pattinson delivers a mature performance. The Teen Superstar proves that he's not a frenzy for his looks, but also for being an actor who can keep you interested. Emilie de Ravin looks and acts well. Chris Cooper is excellent, as always. Pierce Brosnan, in a serious role, is very good. Ruby Jerins as Pattinson's sister, is remarkable. You feel for her, that's how effective she is. Others fill the bill.'Remember Me' is a poor show. Apart from the performances, nothing else works. From my side: Not A Must Watch!",Remember Me
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,Manipultive tripe that should be burned,1,3 August 2010,"I had been hearing mixed reviews on Remember Me, but my friend had rented this movie and asked if I wanted to watch it with her. I figured I would give the movie a fair chance. Robert Pattinson is an actor who is trying to get out of his Twilight stereotype, so doing a dark drama with his brooding look that I had on my face the whole time while watching this film was such a ""stretch"". Honestly, I'm not being mean, he's just not a good actor, he's still got a very long way before he gets out of the stereotype. So for the film, before the ending I really thought it was an alright film. I didn't really feel for the characters as this was a pretty manipulative film trying to get you to be constantly sad and not lightening up on your emotions, but then the ending. I cannot describe the HATRED I have for this film, the tragic event of 9/11 is used to pull our heart strings and all I kept thinking was ""oh, no, no, no, no, no no NO!"" I told my friend to turn of the movie because I was so beyond angry. Anyone who dares defend this movie to me, I will question your taste in film and human suffering, even my friend said they went too far. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life and I hate everybody that was involved in it.Tyler Hawkins, a moody, directionless 21 year-old, is auditing classes at NYU and working in a bookstore. He has had a strained relationship with his businessman father, Charles since his brother Michael's suicide. Charles appears to lack concern for Tyler's younger sister, Caroline, to whom Tyler is very close. One night, Tyler and his roommate Aidan find themselves in trouble with the police. Later, Aidan sees Neil, the police officer who roughed Tyler up, dropping Ally, his daughter, off at NYU. He decides to retaliate against the detective by persuading Tyler to sleep with and ultimately dump Ally. After spending some time together, Ally and Tyler bond over the losses in their lives and begin to fall for each other. After Ally sleeps over at Tyler's house, she and her father have a fight, ending with Neil hitting her. Ally then moves in with Tyler and Aidan. Neil breaks into Tyler's apartment and confronts Tyler. Tyler provokes Neil by confessing to Aidan's plan and his initial reason for meeting Ally, which in turn forces Tyler to confess everything to Ally. She leaves him angrily and returns to her father's home. But Tyler is still in love with Ally and hopes to reunite with her.Robert Pattinson is trying to pull a James Dean, very Rebel without a Cause and it's not working out too well. The great performance out of this film was from the child who played his sister, Ruby Jerins, she was the only interesting character. Even Pierce Brosnan's character who is supposed to be the ""bad guy"" through most of the film, I understood his character more than Roberts'. He's made to look not caring, but when you learn what he does for the family and even though he sacrifices time with them for his work, it happens. He's paying for Rob's apartment and school and he's complaining all the time to his dad. The chemistry between Rob and Emile was OK, nothing special. But like I said, this went from an alright film to the ultimate slap in the face. If they were going to kill Rob's character, that's fine, but why 9/11?! What was the point?! Shame on the director, the writer and anyone who thought that this was OK to put in this movie like that! To those who voted this movie a 7 or above, I have nothing to say but it's a shame about the lack of human compassion. This movie is a pain and I hated it, I haven't been this angry about a film in a long time, that's saying a lot. If I could rate lower, I would.1/10",Remember Me
11,thesar-2,Remember Remember Me? Not many did.,1,12 July 2010,"Further proving Robert Pattinson (PATTINSON! – said in best George Costanza, from Seinfeld, voice with fists shaking in the air) cannot either hire a good acting coach or hair stylist, we have Remember Me, the ironic title becausenoonewilleverremember such trash.Currently, it ranks 28% at Rotten Tomatoes and made an un-astonishing $19 million. Neither specifically state it's an awful movie, but trust me: this movie is unbearable and should be avoided. However, if curiosity killed your cat and if you can make it all the way to the enormously predictable and thee most offensive ending of all time, you'll deserve your punishment for ignoring my warning: Do NOT watch this movie.I should just throw in the spoiler for the finale. Hopefully that'll sway you from seeing such melodramatic trash. But, it's so foreseen, it's a pain just to wait for it to happen.Okay, I won't ruin the end, but I'll give you the clues that makes the climax blatantly obvious: The movie begins in 1991 with a tragedy – get used to that; this movie preys on throwing one over-dramatic subject over the next, practically begging you to cry – and then fast-forwards 10 years for the grand finale of human tradegy. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE MOVIE.#1: I don't think I gave anything away since they spell it out to you, literally dozens of times of what's to come and what's the time frame. And #2: I felt they all-but mimicked ""that despicable day"" for purposes of manipulating the audience's emotions.For that reason alone, this movie deserves no more than one star. If I gave less, I would. But, it doesn't start with the ending. There's so much more wrong with this feature.It's almost a given Pattinson (PATTINSON!) can't act, (SEE: Twilight and New Moon) but here he shines in what NOT to do. If the absolutely hilarious boardroom scene doesn't banish him from even attending an Oscar party, the down-right awkward pick-up scene should put him in front of a firing squad. Speaking of awkward scenesthis movie's full of them. One after another. Each more nauseating than the last; the movie even makes you want to vomit, just like the character Ally (de Ravin) did not oncebut twice! When the movie actually starts off promising, with the first of, say, 57 disasters, as in, to explain a character's motivation/mood later, it quickly begins to sink, almost immediately. We are introduced to numerous names, characters and mood swings, it's tough to keep up. They literally crammed a full dramatic television series on CW in about 45 minutes and just when you think there's absolutely no point to this movie, they dive into, what I think they meant as the plot.Rebellious young male Tyler (played by Pattinson, PATTINSON!) whowait, did they really name him Tyler? Fight Club he ain'tfights strangers and then a cop – for absolutely ZERO reason, and gets thrown, RIGHTFULLY SO, in jail. Regardless of his absent motivation, he assaulted a police officer – just as he was released to go home after an altercation on the streets.His ultimate plan? Well, it wasn't his, but he ate the apple (given from his dimwitted and incredibly stupid roommate) to, get this, it's hilarious!, date the daughter of the cop who justifiably arrested him in order to, well, uh, I guess get back at him? Normally this would have the 1,000-year-old predictable result: boy meets girl under false pretenses, boy lies to girl, boy gets girl, boy falls for girl, boy's lie comes out and loses girl, girl forgives boy because, hey, it's truuuue looove (go ahead, say that in your best Miracle Max (Billy Crystal from The Princess Bride) voice as that's the only way to humor yourself) and everything is alright again for boy and girl. Guess whatyep, that's what happens here.Honestly, I wouldn't have a problem with all of that, if both A: They added some originality and depth to the characters and B: if it weren't based on the most laugh-out-loud foundation, as previously explained, that I've ever heard. EVER.So there's two firsts, so I have to hand it to this movie. It now sits close to, if not on top of the worst movie list of all time for containing the most pointless reasons behind the Boy-Lies-to-Get-Girl age-old plot and the worst ending I've seen. Seriously. SHAME ON YOU for using this ending to add dramatic effect. Wait, I've already said that. Allow me to finish up the plot synopsis Actually there's a lot morebut that's not a good thing here. Above the already stupid ideas I've already mentioned, there's an emotionally detached and rich father (Bronson) with reason, a Little Miss Sunshine daughter who yearns for both love and paintbrushes and the now-grown up daughter, Ally, who survived the movie's original catastrophe and barely shows a second of coping. I'm leaving out, literally a dozen more dramatic turns and outbursts, but suffice to say, none of it's worth repeating. You should not remember this movie.I say ""SHOULD"" because if it weren't for that endingyou may never forget, unfortunately. Obviously: SKIP THIS MOVIE.",Remember Me
12,Robert_duder,Surprisingly emotional and well thought out romance,8,25 July 2010,"Nicholas Sparks. Did he write this? No. But it has absolutely everything you would expect from a film that he penned. So if you choose to (although I encourage you to read my whole review because I AM a brilliant writer) you can know everything you need to know about this film in the first two words. If you like Sparks, Remember Me is a terrific film and if you don't...steer clear. I don't know what my expectations were going into this film because obviously anything Robert Pattinson is in becomes nothing short of chaotic before it even hits the theatre. I have no real opinion on him either way but Remember Me made me respect him as an actor a little more. The film actually turned out to be a solid story, a good romance, with decent performances. I enjoyed it and would see it again anytime. I also went into the film knowing the 'big twist' at the end of the story so I suppose in some ways its more impressive that the film still left me impressed even though I knew how it ended. If you don't know how it ends well this film will likely impress you even more than it did me and that is really saying something. I think secretly I had low expectations for it but it was absolutely worth seeing.Robert Pattinson plays troubled twenty something student Tyler. As the movie unfolds we learn a lot about his family, his father, and the hard times he has dealt with. Pattinson is easy to watch, really shows some terrific emotion and carries the film well. I hope he does more films like this so people can move past his Twilight persona which might be near impossible to do. Its not an Academy Award worthy performance but its very good. The lovely Emilie de Ravin plays the girl who catches Pattinson's eye Ally. Now I know de Ravin well from being on Lost so I already know she's a good actress. Her character in Remember Me is not as stand out as I would have hoped. I mean she is good and the character is fun but its more subtle than what she could do I think. Perhaps the character is toned down so as to not overshadow the driving force of the film in Pattinson but that's unfortunate. Still the two of them together are cute and have good chemistry. Maybe not epic romance chemistry but good. Ruby Jerins as Pattinson's little sister is absolutely amazing. You want to see young talent in the making just watch her terrific, funny, heart breaking performance. Pierce Brosnan gives a really awesome performance as Pattinson's emotionally estranged father. This is one of his best performances in a long time. Him and Pattinson have amazing chemistry and their fireworks are what keeps this film rolling. Finally terrific character actor Chris Cooper plays de Ravin's father who is not a fan of Pattinson courting his daughter. Cooper is a grade A actor but they seem to make him take a back seat in the film as well unfortunately.I often refer to the fact that a director that comes from Television can't always hold an audience for two hours the way they should be but there are always exceptions and Allen Coulter would be one of those. Maybe its in his favour that most of the Television he works on is HBO where restrictions are a lot lighter in what needs to be done to tell the story. Despite Remember Me being a romance film at its core he spends a lot of time focusing on the family that is torn apart and in crisis and the romance that is blossoming around that. This is what makes the film really interesting and keeps the story moving. I think its clever that the actual romance in the romance film takes a back seat to this family and everything that's happened to them and how Pattinson's character through his romance brings them all together. It is well worth seeing. It might be a little sappy for those looking for something more entertaining and its a far cry from a comedy but you won't be disappointed if you're a romance fan. Check this out!! 8/10",Remember Me
13,ThomasDrufke,Overwhelmingly Tragic,6,19 June 2019,"I will always remember 'Remember Me' as the first Robert Pattinson film I watched post-Batman announcement. It's also a film that, even though I watched it nearly 2 weeks ago, I'm having trouble putting my thoughts together. It's a mostly dramatic (and without humor) romance between two people flooded with tragedy. And tragedy is the name of the game with this one, as you're never really free of it. The quote from the movie that sticks with me most is ""whatever you do in life will be insignificant. but it is very important that you do it anyway"". Perhaps that's a good way of looking at the movie. It's not a great film, but it's important you see it anyway? The movie never really feels like a full arc or story, even after its' final tragic moments. But in coming full circle with my opening, Robert *Battinson* is actually quite good here.6.3/10",Remember Me
14,MLDinTN,"if you want to feel depressed,,,",6,16 April 2011,"watch this. This movie was OK, but the middle moved quite slow. Then it throws in a sad, depressing twist ending.The movie is about two young people falling in love. First, there is Ally, a daughter of a cop, who saw her mother murdered when she was young. Then there is Tyler, whom has no real direction in life. He's just mad because his rich dad, Charles, pays little attention to him or his sister. And he had a brother that committed suicide.

They see Ally with her dad and decide to ""play"" with her to get back at her dad. Tyler is to date her then do something like dump her. But it turns out he really likes her so a romance starts. The film focuses more on Tyler and his dad and him trying to get his dad to pay more attention to the younger sister. Then there is the twist ending put in to make you cry.The acting was just OK.

16,callanvass,"Pattinson has officially made a believer out of me, with this star-making portrayal (Not Twilight)",8,8 January 2011,"(Credit IMDb) A romantic drama set in New York City during the summer of 2001, where Tyler, a rebellious young man, meets Ally through a twist of fate. Her spirit helps him heal after a family tragedy, though soon the circumstances that brought them together threaten to tear them apart.OK, I realize Pattinson got his stardom due to Twilight, but let's face it. It certainly wasn't for his performances, even though he wasn't bad in them. Here is where I feel he will truly get taken seriously. Not only is he strong, but the movie itself is pretty damn strong. His and Emilie de Ravin's chemistry is the main focal point, and it's what makes the movie as good as it was. I also have to give credit to the writer for giving us such a great conflicted story with the trio of Pattinson, Chris Cooper, and de Ravin. We see the struggle between Cooper and de Ravin, it's not only heartbreaking, but believable as well. I also felt Pattinson's background story with the death of his brother equally effective, especially his neglecting father. I was just engrossed from start to finish, and I truly felt my world shatter when I hit the ending itself. It's not a movie I'll watch over and over, due to the heavy subject matter, but it's certainly a vastly important one.Performances. Robert Pattinson gives without a doubt, the best performance so far in his career. He is taking on more serious roles as of late, and it'll continue with Water for Elephants. I hope he keeps it up, because he was excellent here. Not only does he show a great balance of vulnerability and likability, but we are able to feel for him as well. I didn't think he had this in him, but he proved me wrong. I also liked the angry side he showed. Emilie de Ravin is great as well. I didn't feel as much as I did for her, as I did with Pattinson, but she was still great nonetheless. Chris Cooper is a magnificent actor, and he gives yet, another awesome portrayal. His intensity gave me chills, and he remained likable, even with his conflicted character. Lena Olin does well in her small part, while Peirce Brosnan plays the snooty, forgetful Father to a T.Bottom line. I know I'm raving on and on about this, but that's because I was genuinely surprised by how good it was. It's an excellent movie, and I hope you feel the same sentiments as I do. Pattinson has nowhere to go but up from here. Highly recommended 8 ½ /10",Remember Me
17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,24 June 2010,"Remember MeThe best way to ensure that someone will always remember who you are is to repeat your name as many times as possible as you are horribly disfiguring their face.Thankfully, this doomed love story isn't about some macabre memorization method, it's about two college kids dealing with the death of family members in two very different ways.Still reeling from the affects his brother's suicide, cynical Tyler (Robert Pattinson) finds solace in Ally (Emilie de Ravin), an optimistic young girl who learned to appreciate life after having witnessed her mother's brutal murder. As the two hit it off, Ally's police officer father (Chris Cooper) feels that Tyler's devil-may-care attitude is adversely affecting his daughter's behavior. At the same time, Tyler's father (Pierce Brosnan) is trying to deflect his son's vicious verbal attacks that are motivated by his feelings of abandonment, brought on by their family's loss.While the story does conclude with a substantial shocker, reaching that apex is a pretty daunting task, due to the mournful meandering of the leaden lovers, and overabundance of daddy issues.As for sorting out mental recall, remember this simple rule: Basketball players go in the long-term, midgets go in the short-term memory.

18,851222,Good movie,9,17 July 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Remember Me"" (2010) was a a very pleasant surprise for me. I was involved in a movie from first minutes till the very last end. I cared for the characters, it all (almost) was plausible and believable. This is one of the best romantic movies around. Performances were uniformly good from all. Script was good - very involving. Directing was solid - at running time 1 h 50 min this movie didn't drag for a second and the ending was very good and moving. Overall, ""Remember Me"" is kinda ""in your face Nicolas Sparks"" romance movie. It has much realistic and plausible situations, realistic and not cheeze romance and some ""twist"" (if you can call it that) at the end that wasn't manipulative. This a very good movie to all tastes.",Remember Me
19,Rodrigo_Amaro,Surprisingly Great,10,14 May 2011,"This film is a lovely surprise, short and sweet with some powerful reminders of why we must care for each other because we never know how brief is our passage on Earth and which things we want to remember of the ones we love. ""Remember Me"" despite presenting many already seen things delivered in other flicks somehow manages to gives us something more than just a lovely romance between Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin, it has an extra thing in its final moments that causes different reactions to each viewer. I heard one small thing about this surprise, completely forgot while watching but somehow it was predictable in a way, but it doesn't ruin the viewing (I won't say what it is, you have to watch).Our importance is on the things we do, and it is essential to all of us that we do because no else will do, this film says, basically. So, if you can't stand dramas, or can't stand Pattinson, please forget about this useless negative thoughts and go watch this film, it'll say something good about yourself and about life. Watch it and enjoy it to the fullest or you'll regret for not doing so. The plot is very simple, very well written, not a single wasted moment; the acting is superb from everyone involved (although I had a dislike on Pattinson's friend, that guy was so annoying), Chris Cooper is always excellent, Pierce Brosnan has some great moments and the main couple is incredibly good together.I'll finish this review with the translated refrain of Brazilian song ""Pais E Filhos"" (Fathers and Sons) that seems to resume the motto of this film. The lyrics says: ""You have to love people as if there is no tomorrow, because if you stop to think about it, actually there's no tomorrow."" That goes from everything in life, not waste a moment, don't be afraid of anything and do the best that you can for everyone. ""Remember Me"" carries this message from beginning to end and it knows how to use it well, without playing with our perceptions and emotions. A really great film, sometimes trashed for the wrong reasons. 10/10",Remember Me
20,lisafordeay,Tragic film based on the 911,7,9 March 2021,"Remember Me is a 2010 romantic drama starring Robert Pattinson,Chris Cooper,Pierce Brosnan and Emile De Raven. The story takes place from 1991 to 2001 and we see a young Ally(De Raven) at a subway with her mother waiting for a train to come by. However her mom gets murdered by thugs and we flash forward to 2001 where we see a young man named Tyler(Pattinson)grieving the death of his brother who ended his life. His father(Brosnan) works in the Twin Towers in New York. Later Tyler meets Ally and they fall in love. But will tragedy strike.Overall I thought it was a decent flick. I hadn't seen it in over 8 years and i wanted to rewatch it again. The ending was a bit rushed in my opinion as a certain charcther dies and we just hear a voice over and that's it. I don't know was this trying to pass itself as a true life story based on the horror of the Twin Towers blown up in September 2001 where thousands of people lost their lives.If your a fan of Robert Pattinson then check it out.

21,freemantle_uk,An unremarkable film,3,14 April 2010,"They is no denying that Robert Pattinson is popular with teenage girls and the Twilight series is evidence of that. But R-Patz as he is also known wants to prove himself as a serious actor, staring the Salvador Dalí bio-pic Little Ashes and has been torted to play Kurt Cobian in a bio-pic of the great musician's life. But Pattinson has picked to star in this extremely pedestrian romantic drama.Remember Me tells the story of Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson) and Ally (Emilie de Ravin), two star-crossed, similar to famous stories from Romeo and Juliet to Love Story. Tyler is a highly confused man in his early 20s. He is a from a wealthy background, but has a strain relationship with his father Charles (Pierce Brosnan), his older brother has died, and he is only close to his 11-year-old sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins): almost like the character Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye. He is intelligent, but he has no course in live, living in a rubbish apartment in Manhattan in 2001 with his friend Aidan (Tate Ellington). Ally saw her mum shot dead in front of her at a subway station when she was 11. In 2001 she is a student at New York University, with the ambition to become a social worker. She lives with her dad, Neil Craig (Chris Cooper), a harden New York cop and a poor-man's Christopher Walken. He is overprotective of his daughter after what happened. Their two worlds collide after Tyler and Aidan are arrested by Neil, and the two plot their revenge when their find out who his daughter is. They plan to get her to fall in love with Tyler so he could break her heart. But Tyler is not that mean spirited, and the two start to fall for each other. This becomes forced when Ally is hit by her father and the two live together. But there is only a matter of time that the secret is out and all their family lives affect the couple.There is a lack of originality in this film, with plot elements taken from other works, like Love Story, with the couple having witty banter and the woman at first doesn't not like the man. There is the other element that the man is from a wealthy upper-class background, whilst the woman is from a working-class community. The audience has seen this before and Remember Me does not offer anything new. This film is filled with sub-plots that do not lead anywhere. The pace of the film is plodding and it just follows a routine that everyone has seen before. The film that could and should have been made was the element focusing on Tyler's relationship with his sister and trying to protect her from the girls who bully her. The other element that could have been an interesting story was Tyler's grief and post-traumatic stress disorder and could have allowed Pattinson to flex his acting muscles.The direction by Allen Coulter is unremarkable, with no real flair. But he did have weak material to work with. It was shot like a TV movie or like a higher end soap when shot on location.The acting too is nothing special. Pattinson is decent, and does try his best, but there are moments when his ability does slip. However Pattinson's is a pretentious man and not that interesting. Emilie de Ravin is the best performer in the film, but her character too is pretentious and at times does not seem like a real person. Who ever thought Pierce Brosnan could play a Brooklyn-born businessman must have been smoking some very strong weed. He could barely do an American accent and that was poor casting on the filmmakers part. Ruby Jerins performance was much like Abigail Breslin, a girl who is smart, quirky and a little weird, but Jerins was not as talented. It's a shame because there were a few good moments from her. Her character also has moments where you had to really stretch suspension of belief with some of the things she says.Finally, they was no reason for this film to be set in 2001, it could have been easily set in 2010.Overall an unremarkable film, but the audience was divided on gender lines: women liked it, men hated it.",Remember Me

Its Rob Pattinson at what he does best; broody, introspective, tortured, beat up and in love (although personally I think he'd be great in a comedy role). Here he plays Tyler, a young, rebellious man in New York City who is still suffering after the suicide of his brother.He meets Ally, who lives each day to the fullest since witnessing her mother's murder and they fall in love which gives him happiness and meaning in his life for the first time despite the ongoing strained relationship with his father (Peirce Brosnan) and the fact that Ally's cop father (Chris Cooper) is set to make his life miserable.Nobody in this is very happy, but truthfully its my kinda movie; a bunch of messed up, lost people and a plot that leaves you sad at the end, saying, wow. I'm not exactly sure what that says about me however? The ending of this was a huge surprise...did not see that coming! -I'm sure lots of people hated it though.

26,Samiam3,A step in the right direction for Robert Pattinson,7,9 July 2010,"I will raise my glass to Rob Pattinson for this one. His career is young, but this is a step in the right direction. Which each passing scene, he ceases to be the pretty vampire face of Edward Cullen and grows into the face of a human being, a real character. It's still not a terrific performance, but it suspended my disbelief, and also he is still a pretty face.As a romance, Remember me is mildly effective. The chemistry feels rushed and the story doesn't spend enough time with Pattinsson and his co-star for anything compelling to develop. As a heart-warming ensemble film however, Remember Me works nicely. It is a little schematic, but not enough to hurt the drama. The ending is heartbreaking, and is everything but schematic. While Remember Me is not the most potent of stories, it ain't exactly a sissy film either (don't let the PG-13 rating fool you). When it wants to be, the film can get pretty dramatic, but without pushing too far over the line. Some could easily call this a melodrama, but I didn't find the film corny enough for such a label.I will admit that it has its errors, but in the end it is a good watch, and a viewer may get the best of both worlds from Robert Pattinson.

But then the movie drifts away here and there with all those different topics: the really unclear bar fight, the apparent dysfunctional family relationship which abruptly changes near the end, the out of a sudden school bullying, and at last the really out of the blue terrorism link. It's really a bad example of story writing for me. The acting a so-so. Robert Pattinson hasn't really develop his acting here. All his scenes contains pretty much the same face, although I should say that his body language was good. Emilie de Ravin also acted her part at a so-so level not having anything worth mentioning.

31,esteban1747,A film to remember,8,5 April 2010,"This deeply touching film includes various aspects of the present time and a painful fact of the past. The unknown director to me, Allen Coulter, was able to thread all these realities that at the end finishes with something real and unexpected. The indifference of the parents with the behavior of their children is something common in several families, particularly when the children perform well and not wrong; the criminality in big towns is an often phenomenon; young people rebels with the society where they live, all these ingredients are found in this drama very coherently. Obviously, the ingredient love of two young persons, both with their problems, is not missing. My solidarity went to Sgt. Neil Craig (Chris Cooper), Ally's father (Emilie de Ravin), no matter the way he behaved with others. His daughter was the only treasure he had and I agree that he must have to protect her. Heavy workload is the main enemy of the often contacts of parents with their children, and this is very evident in the film. The society for businessmen has been designed nowadays where money and business simply replace any time for entertainment even with dear wife, sons and daughter. Charles Hawkins (Pierce Brosnan) was the case, his good feelings for his family was completely replaced by business, and money is not all in our lives, we die and money will not resurrect us. Coulter with his film was able to show the problems and usual misunderstandings raised in families. The end of the film is really painful to anyone having sentiments of solidarity. The film has good acting of young Englishman Robert Pattinson, child Ruby Jerins, Australian young actress Emilie de Ravin, Chris Cooper and veterans of the big screen, Swedish Lena Olin and Irish Pierce Brosnan.",Remember Me
32,Shattered_Wake,A bleakly depressing romance with a nearly offensive conclusion,7,27 March 2010,"In 'Remember Me,' Robert Pattinson ('Twilight') stars as Tyler Hawkins, a twentysomething in New York City confused about just about everything: life, love, family, etc. After a night of drinking, Tyler is arrested for breaking up a brawl and then assaulting a police officer. When Tyler's friend (Tate Ellington) spots the arresting officer's daughter Ally (Emilie de Ravin of 'Lost') at school, he dares Tyler to sleep with her as revenge. As time goes on, Tyler & Ally fall for one another amidst their separate family problems and issues with one another.When judging a film, it's only proper to judge the film as a whole. There are films like 'The Mist' where an overly dramatic ending was seemingly tacked on for effect to make up for a previous 90 minutes of mediocrity. Here, with 'Remember Me,' the tacked-on ending is one of the few things to actually dislike about the film. The original script from newcomer Will Fetters was, for the most part, very well written with solidly fleshed-out characters and believable dialogue. The cast brought the script to life very well with great performances by the typically forgettable Robert Pattinson and the oh-so-cute Emilie de Ravin, not to forget the always dependable Chris Cooper as Ravin's father. Allen Coulter, whose only other feature film in his 20+ year directing career was the mundane 'Hollywoodland,' does well capturing the extremely personal script while still managing to get a great grasp on the New York City setting. Regardless of all the great elements of this film, one item that will always hold it back from greatness to me and many others was the previously mentioned ending. For the first 100 or so minutes, we are given a bleak and sad film for pretty much every viewer. From lost love to family issues to that feeling of being ""lost"" in life, the film connects with many things we all deal with throughout or lives, and this is important to do in a personal film like this. Therefore, it seems unnecessary that a seemingly unrelated ""surprise"" ending needs to be thrown at us to exacerbate the depressing story. Once the finale is played out, the film completely changes the reason why we're sad to begin with, thus cheapening the meaning of the rest of the movie. I admit, I was emotionally affected like the many others who bawled their eyes out over 'Remember Me,' but that's more for the subject matter of the conclusion than for the actual relevance to the film. Regardless, if one can view the film and take the ending as just another reason to be weepy instead of being offended by it, 'Remember Me' can be a powerfully film for the right reasons. However, be sure to think of the film as a whole before passing any real judgments on it.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",Remember Me
33,PeachHamBeach,How death impacts 2 NY families...,9,14 September 2013,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS...This is the first film I've seen Robert Pattinson in that I've really enjoyed. Sure he's a lovely creature and a good actor too, but not only am I not on board with the Twilight craze, I'm just not all that familiar with his work (though I went ahead and watched Little Ashes right after this one and really liked it).Pattinson plays Tyler, a twenty-something kid in NYC whose older brother committed suicide a few years before. It is not explained why the brother killed himself, but his death has profoundly impacted Tyler's life. The surviving brother keeps a journal and uses it to communicate his grief.Emilie de Ravin, who I know best as a very mean schoolgirl in a TV remake of ""Carrie"", is very sweet and effective as Ally, a girl who is in one of Tyler's classes. Ten years prior, her mother was murdered during a mugging at the subway station, and Ally has not been able to ride a subway since. When Ally's troubled policeman father (good to see Chris Cooper back in action!) arrests Tyler and his best friend Aidan during a street brawl, it provides an opportunity for Tyler, who seems to have been admiring Ally from afar, to get to know the girl. Most of the film is dedicated to how their relationship changes both of them for the better. Ally's father has a violent temper, and has obviously not recovered emotionally from losing his wife to such violence, and Tyler's father (Pierce Brosnan is great here) is emotionally distant and busy working on Wall Street. Tyler's young sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins, a very good child actor), a prodigious artist, yearns for the father's attention. The relationship between Tyler and Caroline is very touching. I loved the scene where Tyler gets some revenge against a mean classmate who traumatizes Caroline.The ending to this movie was shocking and very depressing. I didn't hate the ending itself, but it makes the movie into a downer overall. Not something you want to watch for a good laugh or to lift your mood. It makes for a great fictional story of a day of tragedy in US history and treats the day with respect. It also lends a wonderful humanity to a group of people we still mourn for even though most of us never met or knew them.I'm not sure if this film is based on a novel.

On top of it, the story was dull, the other characters were just sort of thrown in for decoration, and the sex was pretty bad. (Not too surprising for a Twilight graduate.) The end is probably the most revolting use of a tragedy in a movie I've ever seen in my life. At the same time, it's also a cop-out not to actually show it. How is anyone unfamiliar with it (say an audience 30, 40, 50 years down the road) supposed to know what happened?

I believed all of these characters, and I appreciated the complex plot. The lead reminded me of a Brando or Mickey Rourke.Wounded people find each other by the strangest circumstances. Or maybe not so strange, since people with similar issues make similar decisions. There was something ""old school"" about having a story revolve around white non-Italian people in modern working class New York. Although originally the guy was not working class.It seems that both the main guy and his brother could not find a reason to live and thrive. The annoying roommate accurately tells him to stop with the brooding rebel thing. That was great. Sometimes people are tortured beyond repair. I think that was the message.Meanwhile the actress playing the young girlfriend was totally believable and Pierce Brosnan pulled off an emotionally absent American with skill.There is occasional use of voice overs while the protagonist is writing to his brother. I usually don't like that, but it wasn't overdone. The feel of the city through the photography was not overly glamorized, nor over the top gritty. But New York is not a subtle place and that feeling was conveyed.I found most of the emotional baggage boring and depressing however.

The change and redemption seen in the characters by the film conclusion brought some tears to my eyes (namely, Allyson riding the Metro for the first time since her mother's murder, Aidan's ""Tyler"" tattoo, á la Tyler's ""Michael"" tattoo, the always unavailable father finally taking an interest in Caroline's life).It was a little maudlin at times, but I do not agree with others that feel it was overdone overall. The only acting I found excessive was Cooper, playing Allyson's father. Pattinson and de Ravin had respectable performances. Even Ellington as the roommate was a fun character. The most beloved character was actually Tyler's little sister Caroline. She was perfect as an adorable, precocious young girl with deeper psychological layers. I loved this film. Until the last ten minutes. Supposedly, ""The ending was not tacked on. The screenwriter began the script with every intention of the ending. He was inspired to write the story after reading 9/11 obituaries. There are hints throughout the film that subtly insinuate this."" Well, it sure seemed like it.

I had seen the trailer of the flick earlier and had a notion that the movie wasn't gonna be that good but apparently I was proved wrong. I really liked the movie. The story was perfectly woven by Will Fetters.There were some great performances in the movie. Robert Pattinson did the lead character alongside Emilie de Ravin, Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan. Pattinson had lost his brother and was not on good terms with his father Pierce Brosnan as Pattinson claimed that his father didn't love his family as he didn't have time for his family. Parallel to that goes another story of Emilie de Ravin and her dad Chris Cooper. She had lost her mother when she was quite young. The intro depicts how her mother was murdered right in front of her eyes on the subway. Robert's character is a violent one. He gets into fight quite often. He stopped caring about his life ever since his brother, whom he loved more than anything, committed suicide while working under his father. He nurtured a grudge for his father while Pierce had his ways of manifesting love which obviously he didn't want to show as is depicted in the later stages of the movie. A romantic love story between Emilie de Ravin and Robert Pattinson runs alongside. There's a surprise in the end of the movie for everyone and must I say it wasn't a pleasant one.

38,W011y4m5,Oh dear...,6,6 August 2020,"I'd heard about the tasteless ending to this film before watching so thankfully knew what to expect but after finally getting round to viewing it for myself, I'm afraid the infamy of it - that it's garnered over the years - is rightfully deserved...
""Remember Me"" is surprisingly pretty decent for the first 95% of its runtime & although I totally understand the movie's clear intention - to humanise the victims of that fateful day so as not to see them as just another number or a name amongst the list of the dead; creating a compelling story with complex characters whose journeys were unfinished & callously cut short before their stories had a chance to end naturally; that's something I immediately get but undeniably, the execution of this concept was however (to say the least) somewhat lacking / morally questionable - bordering on sadly being downright exploitative by capitalising off a real world tragedy in order to create some semblance of ""depth"", ""meaning"" or tangible ""profoundness"".
Hence, by doing so, you don't honour the victims or respectfully feature 9/11 in a way which could be cathartic for survivors who view this... But instead you do a disservice to them by utilising the attack as a cheap plot device or a gimmick.
""Remember Me"" stumbles at the last hurdle... And yikes, what a major stumble.",Remember Me
39,raisleygordon,Better than it ought to be.,7,8 May 2010,"When I first heard of this movie, I wasn't interested. But after reading most of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I figured I'd give the film a try. Pierce Brosnan, a somewhat unlikely choice for this kind of drama, turns in a decent performance. After playing James Bond for a few years, and starring in other action pictures, it's hard to imagine him in pure drama. Anyway, this movie contains stuff you've seen before. Case in point: The subplot involving Ally's father, who's a cop. From the first moment he's on screen, you can predict what he'll say and do to Tyler later on. Like I said, this is something we've seen millions of times before, in millions of other movies. As for the relationship between Tyler and Ally, it's not too predictable. There are a few particularly dramatic moments I enjoyed, even though they can be seen a mile away. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie, and plans to, I'll leave it to you to figure out which moments those are. I just wish there were a lot more of these. As for the ending, which I won't spoil, it will shock a lot of people, although I don't think it's as shocking as critics are making it sound. This is probably because we're looking at the characters' point of view, and not at the events taking place. Overall, it's a slightly sappy movie. *** out of ****",Remember Me
40,mrcibubur,Wonderful surprising feel good emotional sentimental movie,8,16 July 2010,"This is certainly one of the surprise movies of the year so far for me and one of the most enjoyable. I watched it with reservations about Robert Pattinson but forget Twilight when watching this movie because he elevates to a different acting plateau here and for those who are bold enough to say Amanda Siegfried matches up to Marilyn Monroe, I can confidently say Mr Pattinson is on the way to matching up to the likes of John Trevolta.This is a terrific film, not just another love story. Yes it is a love story (and I love the chat up Tyler uses on Ally) and I love the way all the main characters are joined up by the dots. If you don't pay attention at the beginning, you might miss some important details for later but never mind, watch the movie again, I certainly did.The storyline is compelling and pure sentimental drama. In many ways it is a sad movie in the mould of 'Just like Heaven' and 'Sweet November' and might bring a few 'Hachiko' teardrops to your eyes but watch the movie and enjoy for all its worth.There is no real bad language or offensive sex scenes and ignore completely any negativity which this film might have picked up.

So when I saw the TV spots for this, I groaned, and figured, ""Oh great. Vampire guy is trying to go James Dean."" The plot isn't very fluffy, but it's not as good as what you might expect from a film that co-stars the powerful acting calibers of Chris Cooper (one of my favorite actors) and Pierce Brosnan. Vampire guy meets a pretty young woman (Emile De Ravin) through coincidence involving the woman's father, played by Cooper, who is a cop and has a beef with Patterson. The youngers hook up and eventually they all face trouble together. Brosnan lends support as Count Dracula.Not a good movie, but if you have to see it, see it for Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan, not for a young man who's trying to break a stero-type that shouldn't be broken. Patterson's career is already ruined to me, and I don't want to see him take a higher billing than Cooper.Before you go rent this, ask yourself; ""Is the lawn mowed?"", ""Do we have all the wash done?"", ""Did I ever get that High School Diploma?""

47,Willie-12,Mediocre Drama With A Sucker Punch Ending,5,6 July 2010,"**The following review contains major spoilers**Where do I begin? My wife finally got me to sit down and watch this film...something she's been trying to do for a while now (previously when it was in theaters, then when it was at a discount theater, and finally when it came to on-demand, which is where I begrudgingly gave in). I must say, I was not very impressed. I've seen worse movies, but I've also seen much better. And, because the ending of the film has generated much controversy I'm going to deal with this review in two parts. The first part will examine the film for what it is for about 95 percent of it's duration...a mediocre melodrama that was ordinary and cliché at best. The second part will deal with the conclusion of the film.The first part: This film, within its genre, is really about as garden variety as a film can get. It tries to play out as heavy drama and you can tell it's one of those films that desperately wants to be taken seriously. However, the script and one of the actors in particular get in the way. The screenplay is sub-par. It's as simple as that. At times the dialouge in this film feels so contrived and unreal, that it makes it very difficult to believe that these characters are real. For me, that is something that can kill a film from frame one. And then there's Robert Pattinson (Tyler Hawkins). Why he was chosen for this film is beyond me. I guess I know why he was chosen. I'm just disappointed that whoever was responsible for casting him was obviously more interested in capitalizing on the popularity of the Twilight films than getting someone who was actually qualified to take on a role such as this. This is a perfect illustration of someone in over their head. Now that's not to say that there wasn't anything good about Remember Me. Fortunately for the sub-par script there were some pretty good performances that saved it from completely crumbling. Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper were, at times, very good. The board room scene comes to mind. Brosnan took over that scene and his believability led to a tension that felt genuine. And I think the best performance in the film did not come from any of the actors that I'd ever heard of. Ruby Jerins was by far what I consider to be the diamond in this rough. Her performance as Caroline Hawkins displayed a vulnerability that was genuine, powerful, and heartbreaking. I expect to see her career blossom quite nicely in the coming years.Now on to the ending: There has been considerable debate as to whether or not the conclusion of this film was exploitative of September 11th. On the one side there are those who say that it was exploitation and on the other side there are those who say that it wasn't. I think to adequately examine this issue, we must first try and understand just what exploitation is. Exploitation is, in its simplest terms, when someone uses something for a purpose. More specifically it can be described as when someone uses something or someone (a person, group, event, etc.) for a selfish purpose. Now to get at the heart of the matter as to whether or not the makers of this film used 9/11 in an exploitative manner, I think we first have to try and answer another question. Was the use of 9/11 at the conclusion of the film necessary? Had the film been based on a true story about someone who actually died in the attacks on 9/11 then obviously it would have been necessary to include that element in the film. But it wasn't a true story. Had the film actually been about 9/11 itself, or specifically about the World Trade Center, then you would expect the 9/11 aspect to be included in the film. But it wasn't about 9/11 or the World Trade Center. Had the film been adapted from another medium like a book, and that other medium had concluded with someone dying in the 9/11 attacks, then you would expect to see that conclusion in the film as well. However, it wasn't based on another medium. It was an original screenplay by a first time screen writer. All of that, coupled with the fact that the September 11th aspect was conspicuously disguised during the duration of the film (with some not so subtle foreshadowing), created an atmosphere that smelled a whole lot like exploitation to me. It was obvious with the scene where the audience reads ""Tuesday, September 11, 2001"" written on a chalk board in Caroline's school room, as well as the scene that pulls out wide to show Tyler standing and looking out of a window of WTC 1, that the filmmakers wanted to create a sense of surprise or shock. They wanted the audience to have to pick their jaws up off the ground. That is the very definition of exploitation, plain and simple. Now I'm not here to defend or condemn the makers of this movie for using 9/11 in such a way. After all, it was their right under the first amendment to do so. However, those who think it was not exploitation really need to take the following into consideration: They could have killed off Tyler in any number of ways (i.e. car accident, shot while buying a pack of cigarettes at a convenient store that was being held up, etc.). The overall message of the movie (i.e. live life to the fullest, spend time with the ones you love, forgive the ones you're angry with because you never know when a day may be your last) would have still been effectively conveyed. There still would have been a shock value. And it wouldn't have been exploitation.",Remember Me
48,dudedazzreviews,A great romantic drama that people will remember for a long time!,7,12 October 2010,"No doubt Twilight fans flocked to see this in the cinema because Robert Pattinson was in it but I bet they were surprised when they didn't see him sparkle in the sunlight. However, Robert Pattinson proves that he can be more than a sparkling, moody, love-struck vampire. The story was great and told such a loving yet tragic tale about two young lovers who help each other through their ordeal of stress, anger and upset and the story was told very well. The acting was great and Emile De Ravin did a fantastic job as Ally and Robert Pattinson proves that he can act better than he can in any of the Twilight movies. Robert Pattinson did a great job and so did the rest of the cast who had taken part in this movie. The characters were written very well as we see the love between two people who have been struck with loss and tragedy grow and we see them help each other emotionally. The script was done very well and the direction was great. This is a must for romance lovers.Remember Me is something that kind of shocked me because I didn't expect a couple of things that happened in the movie which kept a great element of surprise. Normally, I'm not really a massive fan of romance movies, I like them but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch one but Remember Me was a very pleasant surprise. Robert Pattinson and Emile De Ravin were fantastic as their characters and I thought they portrayed their characters well.

49,AmyJenson1995,Robert remembers me of James Dean,8,22 September 2015,"Being an incorrigible romantic girl and my friends and I having a crush on the very cute Robert Pattinson, we commonly decided to watch Remember me between girls.I like Robert Pattinson I loved him on Harry Potter and Twilight even if the movies were far from being masterpieces. But Robert has this kind of magnetism each time we see his face. In Remember Me, I have to say he blew me away. He is like a wild spirit and a lost soul who is still grieving his late brother who took his own life several years ago. He is far from the teenager we are used to see him play. Here he has a darker side, he smokes and drinks a lot, had a lot of anger within himself and like I said he is pretty wild. Because of that, I cant stop myself thinking of James Dean. I see a lot of him in Robert Pattinson at least in this movie: the same grace, the same wilderness. He is raw and so touching. And he is so protective of her sister and her girlfriend.Talking about the girlfriend, Emilie de Ravin is also very graceful and touching. The couple she makes with Robert is soft and raw in the same time. There is a real chemistry between the two actors and we can feel it throughout the movie. In the story both have witnessed the terrible trauma of seeing someone they cherished deeply brutally passing away which still haunts them. This makes this couple even more attaching and touching because we could take it as destiny uniting them to better face their mourning.This made the movie ending even more tragic and terrible. I didn't expect that at any moment. It took me completely by surprise and me and my friends ending up crying like babies. Life is cruel very cruel. They deserved so much better than death tearing them apart again. Seeing Robert in the World trade Center on September 11, 2001 with his last words as saying goodbye and mostly to never forget the beautiful moments they shared together is so heartbreaking.God what a beautiful movie.",Remember Me
50,hughman55,Forget this....,1,1 May 2011,"There ought to be a law against using the tragedy of September 11, 2001 for cheap, manipulative, teen drivel. There, I said it. This film ends with the attacks on 9/11. Now there's absolutely no reason for anyone to waste 2+ hours of their life to watch this derivative piece of crap. This is a badly written, badly directed, and badly acted film. Which is not surprising because when the movie ends you realize that it was only ever conceived as ""an ending"" (9/11) to begin with. The ""movie"" was loosely sorted out later as an afterthought to justify it. It is essentially, an ending in search of a movie... I cannot believe that this garbage ever got backing. One can only conclude that this was dreamed up as a way to capitalize on Robert Pattinson's popularity. This movie genre is not new, or necessarily bad. It's about teen angst: Romeo and Juliet, Legend of Billie Jean, Rebel Without a Cause... Nothing new. There've been many before. Some very good. There'll be many in the future. But, the plot points of this script are ridiculous. It really jumps the shark when Pattinson's character's little sister gets her hair chopped off at a birthday party, for no reason, by a bunch of mean girls. She's traumatized so he takes her to school the next day as her protector, and in front of her class, and her teacher, whips up on one of her female classmates (another 9 year old) for saying, ""Did you do something different with your hair?"" And then hurls a fire extinguisher through the classroom door and out into the hallway. And even though he committed battery on a child, terrorized a whole classroom full of children, and vandalized a school, he's able to be bailed out, once again, by the father he hates (because he earns a living, what a bad man). In the real world you do serious time for something like that because a grown man who would push a small girl around, even if she's a mean girl, has serious problems and can never be a hero in a movie. What's even worse about this bad movie is that is uses 9/11 in order to pretend to be something more than it is. The writer of this mess, Fetters, and the director, Coulter, ought to be ashamed of themselves. If they can't make a decent movie at least have the decency not to cheapen the tragedy of 9/11 in order to provide substance to an otherwise B grade film.",Remember Me

It tells the story of a man named Tyler who has an estranged relationship with his father after his brother committed suicide but still seems close to his little sister and mother. He seems to live a kind of care free life with his roommate while going to college. One evening he breaks up a fight and when the cops get there he decides to mouth off and ends up getting arrested and hit in the face hard by the cop. His roommate finds out the cops daughter, who faced a child hood tragedy herself, goes to the same school and decides to woo her. They become really close throughout the movie as she has an encounter with her father which forces her to move out. It seems like a run of the mill love story but it is not. The Tyler character is very complex and is an interesting story to watch particularly with the scenes with his father. The movie has quite a twist ending though if you pay close attention you should kind of see it coming. The movie clearly states it takes place in 2001 as per the beginning when it starts in 1991 and says 10 years later. It also takes place in most of the summer though it is not clearly stated in the movie. Then when the sister goes back to school you can assume it's September. The 9/11 ending was a very risky way to end the movie and i can see it upsetting many people. I was very surprised this is how the movie ended but you could tell something was up with the tone of movie in the final minutes and when you see Tyler go in the World Trade Centre you could kind of tell this was September 11th.

57,Jules45,This years most ironic title. Probably.,4,13 April 2010,"Before I get a horde of Robert Pattinson fans shoot me down for the mediocre rating let me just this: it is his and the other leads performances that manages to save this film from being as interesting as watching paint dry. Phew now I got that off my chest lets try focus on the good aspects.Robert Pattinson proves he is more than just a pretty face by actually succeeding in something people in his profession call acting; giving his character some humour, anger and general likability for the audience members who aren't just teenage girls. This is certainly more than what can be said for actresses such as Megan Fox who wanted to break the trend of her stereotyped Transformers role by doing Jennifer's Body which proved she was still only capable at flaunting her breast... oops I mean best aspects on screen rather than actually acting.Tyler Hawkins (our leading man) is an uninteresting, unambitious, glad-you-aren't-that-guy kind of person whose life (like the film) plods on a tad too long. After being arrested for a boozy fight and carrying a grudge for the cop who did so he decides on a bet to date the cops daughter (Emilie De Ravin) and this is where surprise, surprise Cupid begins his magic.Unfortunately as you may have noticed this review isn't positive so now its time for the ugly stuff (Twilight/Robert Pattinson fans look away now). While the leads may create enough chemistry on screen the whole film just feels like an overstretched, drama-lacking, eye roller that struggles to really grasp attention of the viewer and feels like a film that has been left on continuous play for a painfully long two hours. Long films aren't a problem (as long as they are good), in fact two hours is about average these days but for what is being shown it feels like it could have easily been condensed into an hour and a half and been a much more enjoyable experience.Still it's not all bad; you start to appreciate the little things such as how much effort it must have been to paint the ceiling of the cinema and how smart the curtains besides the screen are.

62,Sweetigal85,Perhaps the worst ending of all time,3,28 May 2017,"The only reason I am not giving this film a 1/10 is because the acting was so phenomenal and the movie was very good until the soul crushing ending. I love a good tragic romance, but this movie simply went too far. If you want to get your heart ripped right out of your chest, this is the movie for you. It left my heart aching and my mind spinning for days.From the description on Netflix, I knew I was in for a tearjerker. I can handle a little tragedy but only if it is well done. This movie is not well done at all. First of all, the two characters have already lived lives riddled with tragedy. I personally felt that the opening scene was completely unbelievable and very much avoidable. So the two main characters bring happiness to each other's otherwise tragic existences.I loved Tyler's relationship with his little sister, I thought those were among some of the best scenes in the movie. I felt that the premise was forced and ridiculous of Tyler ""only approaching"" Allie to get her cop father to drop the charges against him. That plot line was weak from the very beginning and only serves for them to get in a stupid fight about it later on.I personally realized that the current timeline was 2001 from the very beginning, I know that a lot of people missed that. In the opening scene it shows 1991 flash across the screen and then it says ""ten years later"" when the true action of the story starts. I still was under the impression that 9/11 had already happened though, thus adding to the tragic atmosphere of their existing lives. In their political science class the teacher mentions ""recent terrorist attacks"" which I assumed could be none other than 9/11.Robert Pattinson gives a breathtaking performance and the chemistry between him and the main lead is unquestionable. The only questionable thing is what on earth the director was thinking with his horrifically offensive twist ending. I started to see it coming when they mentioned it was Labor Day...Labor Day in 2001 is obviously before 9/11...so I assumed they were perhaps going to have her cop father killed in the attacks which would have been tragic because they were fighting the better half of the movie. But no...they chose to go an even darker route.It seems like a lot of people loved the twist ending, but I am definitely among those who are appalled and sickened by it. The fact that the director chose to withhold that Tyler's father was working in one of the towers all along is NOT poetic or moving, it is a deliberate trap to throw the viewer off. My issue is not that they incorporated 9/11 into this movie. But to USE 9/11 as your surprise/Sixth Sense twist ending is unforgivable. I would have been more OK with it if from the very beginning you knew that his father worked there. Then it would have just been a tragic story that happened to take place around 9/11.And not to mention how unbelievable this string of events is! So we are to believe that these two sets of families have really been struck with this much tragedy? Ally's mother is murdered right in front of her and then the love of her life dies in the 9/11 attacks??? And poor Caroline...her one brother kills himself and then her other brother dies in the 9/11 attacks? Come on!!! What did these poor families do to anger The Reaper??? Some people claimed that the take away from this movie is that happiness is still possible no matter how much tragedy hits you. I suppose I can see that point but I think it could have been better accomplished without reliving the worst moment in American history. And I think that point still comes across without Tyler dying a horrific, unfathomable death in the end.I am not sure what the take away from this movie is supposed to be but the only thing it made me wish was that I had picked a different movie on Netflix.",Remember Me
63,blackberrybabe,Fingerprints don't fade from the lives we touch; neither does this,9,13 March 2010,"Remember Me is an amazingly haunting film. I saw it opening night and am still thinking about it; probably will for days to come. It is one that should be seen by everyone because of the subject matter.Anyone who says Robert Pattinson can't act needs to do their homework. He most certainly can and proves it in previous films such as The Haunted Airman, Twilight Saga, Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire, Little Ashes and How to Be. These are several different roles that showcase his talent. You don't play Salvador Dali if you can't act. Remember Me is another film that takes his talent to new heights.He plays Tyler Hawkins, an emotionally-withdrawn young man who doesn't know what he wants out of life. He meets the daughter of the cop that threw him in jail and decides to take her out, sleep with her and then dump her in retaliation. Along the way, however, he falls in love with her. When the truth is revealed, you can see the pain he goes through after Ally leaves him. Pattinson is spot-on during this whole film. I especially liked his protectiveness of his little sister (Ruby Jerins). You can see that she is the only one (at first) that he will open up to. Jerins is amazing and adorable as Caroline; I hope we see more of her.Emilie de Ravin is perfect as Ally Craig. I will admit, after seeing previews I did not think that the Lost star was that attractive; my opinion changed after the movie. She is not only beautiful, but amazingly real in this role. She won me over.Tate Ellington plays Tyler's best friend, Aidan Hall, and also provides some of the comic relief. I have not seen this actor before but I have become a fan. Aidan is the one who admits that he's a ""prick,"" but will also go to bat for the ones he loves. You see that at the end of the film with his tattoo. He is a loyal friend to Tyler and Ally and Ellington is great.Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper play the fathers of the leads. Both characters are so different yet also the same. At the end of the movie, you see them come out of their shells and open up more. Brosnan is Charles Hawkins, a high-powered executive who can't make time for his family. This infuriates Tyler and they spend part of the movie fighting about it. After an incident with Caroline, the two make up and reconciliation is on the horizon. Cooper is Neil Craig, the over-protective father of Ally and doesn't approve of her relationship with Tyler. He is an aggressive cop who doesn't do things by the book. Ally and her father grow closer after tragedy strikes them at the end of the film.I won't ruin the ending for those who haven't seen it, but it was ruined for me. I went in knowing what to expect. Not that it affected me any less; I had tears in my eyes as did much of the audience. In a way, I'm glad I knew what was coming; I was able to pick up on subtle hints and foreshadowing that other people may have missed.I cannot stop thinking about this movie and I plan to see it several more times in the theater. I am a Twilight fan and that caused me to become a Pattinson fan. I'm glad I took the time (unlike some other reviewers) to see his previous work. I have respect for Pattinson and know he will be around for a long time. Remember Me will make you laugh, cry, cheer and gasp at its intensity. This film will definitely be remembered.",Remember Me
64,hmsgroop,searching for freedom,8,30 June 2010,"It seems interesting that in a number of his parts Robert Pattinson addresses the theme of freedom / absence of freedom. See for yourself:1) Giselher in ""The Ring of the Niebelungs"". Giselher is a young prince, and, at first glance his life leaves nothing to be desired. But Giselher yearns for freedom. It's not by chance that he always wants to go beyond the walls of the castle, wants to go to battle, to see the world, to love without having to conceal the whole affair , but he may not do what he wants. If he makes some of his dreams come true, it's not due to his circumstances, it's notwithstanding them. Giselher is a wounded heart. He lost his parents in the same way Siegfrid did (by the way, the episode in the smithy leaves a good impression.) Pattinson copes with portraying a wounded person, a person unsure of himself, but a person ready to cast away conventionality and neglect all the bans.2) Toby Jugg. This film echoes ""Leg"" (1992), metaphorically presenting physical and moral traumas, inflicted on a soldier by the war, touches upon the problem of admissibility of evil, limits of evil, obedience and disobedience, refusal to obey cruel orders or their acceptance, personal responsibility, also touches upon the problem of freedom and its absence, looking for the way out and beyond. Toby Jugg is locked within his crippled body, he's locked in his nightmares. Trying to fight his way out of all these, he comes to realize that the measure of evil he has inflicted is already done, and his freedom lies in executing himself, passing a verdict on his night air raid, and on the phonies around him who have distorted his vision. Pattinson copes very well with the psychological tension of this part. It's he who makes the whole film, where had the part been performed by some less talented actor, the film would have been reduced to a Sunday-night mediocre horror. 3) ""Little Ashes"". The actor convincingly addresses the theme of the freedom of an artist. What he does really well is showing the ""evolution"" of Dali. Dali, Lorca and many other artists are ""people skinned alive"", feeling and perceiving the world around them so acutely it's painful for them. All Dali's posing as a genius is just a mask to cover this vulnerability, a mask to hide this pain from himself as well, a form of autogenic training. 4) ""The Twilight Saga"". Many people reproach his Edward Cullen for his still face, absence of emotion. I should say that Edward Cullen is one of the least free characters portrayed by Robert Pattinson. Edward's emotions cannot be as lively and variegated in their visual manifestation as those of ordinary people. On the one hand, Edward has condemned himself as a monster, he sees himself as a castaway, soulless, doomed to empty existence. This gives him a horrible inferiority complex. On the other hand, he understands how breakable the world around him is, how imperfect; he fears to destroy his world and his love. And – this is also the habit of secrecy he has had to practice for about a century. And don't forget the constant physical (the burning thirst) and moral pain he lives in. Edward finds limitations and walls wherever he turns. Would your emotions look lively and natural if you had been trained to practice total self-control and exercise constant analysis? No, this ""slow response"", this constraint speaks in favour of Pattinson's interpretation of this part. By the way, the actor himself named ""aggressive humility"" as the main trait of Edward's character and attitude. I think this definition hits the nail on the head. 5) In ""Remember Me"" the theme of freedom is also touched upon, though it might not be the main one in the film. Tyler's brother has died as a result of his being unable to exercise his freedom in choosing his career, his way in life. Tyler is very much affected by this death, and he can't help thinking about what freedom is for every man, and what necessity is. To cut a long story short, these films analyze different aspects and manifestations of freedom / absence of freedom in different situations: in growing up, in love, in war, in art. A good choice of food for thought. Why does Pattinson repeatedly address this theme? What is it for him personally? Anyway, his interest in the topic is consecutive and consistent. We shall live and see what turns his acting career will take, but, in comparison with somewhat cardboard Cedric Diggory, Rawdy, Art, the actor has made great progress. It's evident he's analyzing, searching, working, perfecting. I believe he will never stop participating in commercial projects (and it's understandable), but, hopefully, will also take part in indie and art-house films, like so many good actors. This will certainly leave room for further professional growth. Anyway, he has all the makings of a very talented actor now, let him make good use of his talent.",Remember Me
65,someofusarebrave,Critics are wrong,10,12 August 2010,"I agree with the review which came immediately before mine. This was the best movie I have seen in years. I really, really believed every character's performance entirely throughout the entire movie. I was surprised by the tragedy at the end, but pleasantly so. I did not feel I was being jolted into feeling something that came unnaturally at that point in the movie. I really, really adored this movie. I can't help but wonder what would make critics review a movie like this so harshly, while movies that I don't even know anyone who saw made the shortlist for the Academy Awards. I REALLY don't know why men who are borderline unwatchable to me are constantly being cast in movies that receive decent and sometimes rave reviews, while actors with this much talent are constantly underrated. Meanwhile, Emilie --who I first saw in 'Roswell' as the evil alien ""Tess""--has long been one of my favorite young female actresses, and has been equally underrated. Just because you don't see the effort behind the acting, doesn't mean the acting isn't there. It's like a dance performance that the audience comes away from thinking, 'that's so easy! I could do that.' Of course, no audience member without a dance background and willingness to work at it would ever be able to perform the routine. However, the fact that this person believes the routine is easy is a credit to the talent of the person who performs it. The acting that the two leads do here is exactly like that. They do such a studied, respectful, careful job here that it would be easy to misunderstand the difficulty of the roles they take on. It is equally easy to doubt the care that they obviously put into their roles. It seems as though most critics are too lazy to honestly think through their opinions and prejudices and the reasons behind them. They would rather reward performances that are predictable and boring, and write rave reviews for the same actors and actresses every time. That way, they don't have to work as hard. Similarly, mainstream movies rarely receive the level of criticism that movies like this do. Most critics seem as though they would rather level harsh words at any movie that dares to step outside of the accepted margins of what movie-making has traditionally been. The fact that movie-making has also been a rich man's game which addressed issues only relevant to upper-class heterosexual white people seems to have escaped most critics. Any movie that addresses the issues of any other group of people than this has had a very difficult time receiving notice from mainstream Hollywood, much less critical acclaim. Movies that dare to portray these communities in uplifting, inspirational ways seem all to be maligned as 'sentimental.' I think that critics simply want to justify their own terror of crying.",Remember Me
66,IheartCali5882,What a powerful performance by Robert Pattinson....what a good movie,7,1 July 2010,"This is not, by any means, the conventional meet cute romantic comedy. It's a high-intensity drama all the way. Both lead characters, Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin are troubled souls, each involved with their own demons, each trying to come to terms with their lives after the death of a loved one.Tyler Hawkins, played by Rob,is the introspective-cerebral type who always seems to make it look cool and even noble to be a total slacker. Emilie de Ravin is basically just ""there"" but she handles what the part requires of her well enough. Of the two it's clear that Rob is a far better actor. Having only seen him in Twilight, I wasn't sure how well he would do in a film that required so much more of him, but after watching the movie, my doubts have officially been put to rest. The guy is good. Damn good.The supporting cast, played by Chris Cooper, Lena Olin, Pierce Brosnan, and the absolutely adorable Ruby Jerins, add a richness that elevates the movie from your basic syrupy love story to something more unique and memorable. And beyond that, the ending takes a REALLY unsettling turn that I definitely was not expecting. This is the kind, that for some of us, depending on who and where we are, will stick with us for hours, maybe days after.

67,woinaroschy_1979,"50% like, 50% dislike",5,6 September 2010,"I'm having a difficult time rating this movie. There are a lot of things I like, and things I don't like. Let's start with what there is to like: the acting was OK, from all of the characters. No one shines, but no one is a total failure either. The characters are pretty normal everyday people like me and you, fathers, sons, daughters, mothers, friends. The only character who should be ""different"" from the rest of the crowd is the main character, Tyler (Robert Pattinson). I thought his acting pretty decent, but unfortunately the plot is such that it does not explain very well the motivation behind this character. Tyler is a rebel without a cause. He's 21 going on 22 and acts like 16, getting into fights, smashing things and generally trying to make a tantrum every time his whims are not satisfied. Apparently he's angry at his dad who is the typical successful high shot with no time for his family. Tyler is chain smoking, hanging out in the library and in coffee shops, and attends some classes but is not enrolled at university. A true rebel who does not want to integrate the system. ""Get a job kid and get over yourself"" comes to mind immediately. In spite of this, Pattinson manages to convey the impression that there is something much more serious going on in Tyler's soul, some deep suffering, related to his brothers suicide. We don't learn much more about this tragic event except that he hanged himself on his 22nd birthday. Tyler blames of course his father for this, and isn't able to cope with the loss...hence all the rage and violence boiling underneath the surface. A plus point for Pattinson who is able to convey us this impression, a minus point for the script/plot that doesn't. So Tyler gets involved with Ally or Allie (Emily de Ravin), who has also a tragic past (mother shot in front of her when she was 11). Unlike Tyler, Allie has managed to cope with this event, but has a problem with her over-protective cop father. She runs away from home to move in with Tyler. And here comes another dislike: I never understood what she saw in Tyler or how her feelings for Tyler came to be. She goes on a date with him, then overnight moves in and has sex with him. I guess the message they wanted to convey was that Allie understands why Tyler is disturbed, being herself scarred by tragic events, and because of that falls in love with him. Well the acting from De Ravin does not explain it. So these 2 tragic souls find each other and have some angry sex. Truly, the angry sex is well described and played out, I think it's one of the most realistic scenes of the movie, especially after Tyler comes home from a fight with his dad. Then the plot goes downhill: Tylers sister gets a bad haircut from some mean girls from school and this is like a total tragedy to all the family. I was a kid too and know how cruel kids can be, but this is ridiculous. The hot shot father finally steps in and shows that he has a heart after all, he just needed a bad haircut to trigger it. Tyler is finally happy with his dad and lives blissfully with Allie, when all of a sudden another tragedy happens...I'm not going to say more, but I find it an artificial tear jerker and put there just to impress the audience. Kill a puppy, break a child's leg, whatever as long as it makes the audience cry.Overall bad script, saved partially by the good acting from Pattinson. Plus I'm not really convinced by the authenticity/reality of the situation and characters described, it just seems too artificial at various points.",Remember Me
68,Safetylight,Manipulative Propaganda - They really mean REMEMBER!,1,2 July 2010,"The performances were solid. The production values were flawless. The whole thing was well made. I can see why people like this.But you have to understand that this is DESIGNED to play on heart-strings and to keep wounds fresh so that political manipulations can continue.I honestly couldn't figure out what the point of this film was until the end. It fit no pattern. It was sad all the way through; even the happy moments were infused with sadness. Then those two towers filled the screen, and ugh. . , Ugh. It all fit into place. This film was deliberately designed to keep people crying and to link it all to ""terrorism"". How DARE those terrorists do this to such good, striving people? What should we DO? Why.., perhaps we should do as the main character and his father does; retaliate with violence and corruption!(The violence of terrifying a little girl in her school, and of a powerful CEO forcing a bunch of children to move to other schools by intimidating their parents. Sorry, but that's how the mob works.)Yes. All the messages were there, all driven down deep into the long-term memory and subconscious by strong emotions linked with deliberately placed messages. If you know anything about marketing and brain chemistry, you'll immediately see just how much vile craft this film was peddling.Joseph Goebbels couldn't have done better.Every single shred of this film was an emotional manipulation, designed to facilitate the continued destruction of Palestine by Israel, and to facilitate the continued descent into madness which is the sinking ship of global geo-politics and population control.It was also designed to show us that, ""Hey, psychopathic executives are just caring parents who despite the pain they cause, just need our sympathy and support."" Yeah, those villains at BP just need a loving son to break through to them, and they shouldn't serve jail time.I'm sorry I watched this piece of tripe.

70,siobhanmckibbin,Not a film to remember!,2,18 February 2012,"I must admit the real reason I wanted to watch Remember Me, was the fact it was starring Robert Pattinson. Sadly though, even having him in this film didn't make it any better.Remember Me opens with a scene of robbery. A mother ends up murdered at a queens subway station platform in 1991, with her young daughter Ali looking on. Then the movie leaps forward ten years to 2001. The narrative focuses on the developing relationship between Tyler and Ali. Tyler's family has been torn apart by the suicide of his elder brother and Tyler is caught up in emotions of rage and self pity. Tyler and Ali's meeting is not coincidental as it was Ali's father who arrested Tyler previously. Having both suffered great loss in their short lives they soon embark on a passionate relationship.Remember Me contains a number of over pretentious scenes that dramatise a very thin and unexplored plot. This story tries to show how relationships and the results of our actions can have profound, yet unpredictable ways of manifesting. There are early scenes of violence in the film, which i suppose was used to try to charge the emotional conflict which was to happen later on.As the movie dragged on i kept hoping for something more, but all i got was lack lustre scenes, which did not flow well, let alone make much sense. I was unable to engage with any of the characters on any type of emotional level, and therefore completely disconnected from the film and what was actually happening.The moody, male protagonist played by Pattinson has severe contrasts in his character. One minute he is chatting happily to his sister, the next thing he is acting out and ending up in jail. The filmmakers did not delve deep enough into his character to provide any kind of explanation. Instead as soon as he sees pictures of his family on his dad's computer, all his troublesome issues seem to be resolved.What makes Remember Me even worse, is that it uses 9/11 to pretend that it is more deep and meaningful than it actually is. The fact that the filmmakers felt the need to tie this fictional story in with a real life tragedy, just goes to show how lacking the script actually was.This is a badly acted, badly directed, and badly written film.

There is no chemistry what so ever between the two. Not for lack of trying, de Ravin is doing great and Pattinson not so bad, but there is just no spark. Just well mimic-ed actions and rehearsed lines. The script itself i just really bad and boring, but that is not the actors fault. (It seems like after the Twilight attention Pattisons PR agent just wanted him out there and it feels like the movie was for the actor instead of the other way around) The movie is another one of the ""relationship between""-dramas, where the characters go through the motion with the parent-child, brother-sister, boyfriend-girlfriend, dead family members, friends, enemies and even the cliché of the capitalist dad vs. the social working mother. The roommate who is written in as a comic relief but who isn't funny. The only one who makes the movie somewhat tolerable is the younger sister (Jerins) who not only acts great, but makes the relationship between her and Pattinsn look real. Other than that, in all honesty, there is more spark between Pattinson and his bike. The ending is bizarre and seem like a mockery of extreme proportions.",Remember Me

Initially, I found it hard to figure out the relationships between all the characters; it's not spelled out, but it's also difficult to piece it together. However, once the characters and their relationships and the story is established, I could follow the movie better and began empathizing with them. Although many scenes are slightly predictable if not cookie cutter, they still work for the film. I considered the ending to be a unique one, and those dialogue-less last scenes were apt as nothing needed more to be said. The heart would tell the rest. This is not the best film, nor the worst. It is a good, quaint story that might just help register a little more sympathy , compassion and understanding to those in our own lives.",Remember Me
73,Kellyann-1,Excellent movie. Emilie de Ravin and Robert Pattinson shine in talent and chemistry.,10,12 March 2010,"I went to see Remember Me today and was highly impressed. It is an excellent movie. The movie is a lot of things but mainly for me it was a compelling love story, and an engaging family drama about two families who have suffered tragedies and never truly recovered.Emilie de Ravin really shines as Ally. She is a phenomenal actress. Emilie is quite the scene stealer and I hope to see her in more films. Emilie's scenes with the talented Chris Cooper were a highlight for me. Chris plays a cop and over protective father who has dealt with his family tragedy by being overbearing,silent and at time drinking.Emilie de Ravin and Robert Pattinson have incredible sizzling on screen chemistry. Ally and Tyler's love story is one to remember.Robert Pattinson is surprisingly good as Tyler. I say surprising because I didn't know if he would escape playing Edward Cullen but he has. Pierce Bronsan is good as Pattinson's distant and cold father. He adds depth and heart to a character who can come across as unfeeling. Lena Olin and Ruby Jerins are good in supporting roles. Ruby Jerins in fact was sublime and another scene stealer.

74,Caribstu,Absolute Rubbish.,2,2 July 2010,"When I bought this DVD I had no definitive idea what the story was about, i'd not seen any trailers. From the cover I suspected it was a romance, and as the store was doing buy ten get two free, I picked it up. It sat on the DVD rack for three weeks before I got around to watching it. The film is about 1 hour and 57 minutes long.The opening scene is of a robbery turned murder of a woman on a queens subway station platform in 1991. Then we jump forward ten years. For the next ten minutes we're rapidly bombarded with a whole bunch of new characters in such a tenuous way that we're pretty much left to figure out who's who and how they are connected for ourselves. In fact the character introductions and development is almost as random as throwing dice. Eventually they land on the films romantic interest, Tyler and Ali.Tyler's family has been torn apart by the suicide of his elder brother and Tyler seems to claw through life in a mixture of rage and self pity. Ali, who's mother we saw being murdered on the subway platform in the opening scene seems, other than for witnessing her own mother's murder, to be a fairly non descript person. The acting is weak throughout the cast, Tyler and his ""roomie"" in particular are quite irritating. The dialogue bland and unimaginative. A scene develops where Ali tells Tyler her mother was murdered and he doesn't even ask one single question about it, but simply brushes it aside and moves on to another subject. None of the characters are developed enough to make you care about them, Tyler's mother and stepfather/mother's boyfriend ( we don't know which he is it's that vague) are so distant to us they might as well be extras. Those whom are developed , such as Tyler's father and Ali's father are both completely anti social and simply not particularly likable anyway. So here we are, rambling through a film going absolutely nowhere about people we don't much care for in what could best be described as a celluloid over indulgent quagmire with little if any saving graces.SPOILERS At 1 hour and 38 minutes I actually asked myself ""does this film have any point to it?"" then at 1 hour and 44 minutes in a classroom scene the teacher has written on the blackboard ""Tuesday September 11 2001"" and the first thought that went through my mind was ""oh for goodness sake, that's what it's about"". The film ran on for another ten minutes, needless to say what the end was about, how the lives of the various characters were affected blah blah blahetc.. etc.. Was this an intentional twist? Were we supposed to feel sympathy for the characters we don't like just because of a tragedy? Or did the director actually think we'd care about these nothing irritating people? Using the image of Tyler standing looking out a window of one of the World Trade Centre towers was probably supposed to be powerful tragic ending but it just seemed pathetic, weak and quite frankly all a bit tawdry. I'm sure the American's loved this film, got all upset and tragic over it but for the rest of us it's just total over indulgent w**k basically. Still, I expect Hollywood will continue to churn out low grade self indulgent ""feel sorry for us"" films about 911 for the next twenty years like they did Vietnam and I doubt this will be the worst (Adam Sandler's ""Reign Over Me"" already tops this for sheer c***ness).If you're not from the US honestly don't bother to watch this because it's absolute rubbish.2/10",Remember Me

Remember Me configures itself to do just that. I can't recall a film in the recent past that made me angry for these very reasons.

Not a cliché romance AT ALL, it's a drama, a heavy one, which requires more effort from the cast than many other types of movies, and that being said, I think, the whole cast did a very, very good job. Despite the rather 'slow' flow, the movie keeps you focused.. and once you've watched the entire film you realize it IS a good a good one. Really impressive... Makes you think about life and makes you ask questions, you know? That, I really like. AND... needless to say, Robert was VERY good as Tyler. Great job.

77,hannah8700-1,A Bitter Sweet Remembrance,8,21 March 2010,"This movie was so incredibly sad! It's about loss, tragedy and forgiveness. It tells the story of Tyler Hawkins, played by the talented Robert Pattinson, and his struggle to go on living after his brother's suicide. His strained relationship with his estranged father also comes into play throughout the film. Before meeting Ally, Tyler lives each day without meaning or purpose, trapped in the past without much hope of a future. But Ally forces him to feel all the emotions he's kept trapped inside for so long, and together they find peace and come to terms with their pasts. I also loved the close bond he and his sister, Caroline, shared throughout the film. He was very much a ""big brother."" But just when you start to think that everything is going to be okay for Tyler and his family the unthinkable happens- September 11th. In the last few minutes of the film, they show Pattinson waiting for his father in his office, and then as the camera fades you realize that he is looking out from the World Trade Center, and at that point you know what happens next. But that's life- you live, you love and eventually you die. It was just so sad that after all he had been through, all the pain and heart break, he was still able to find happiness. But he lost it all in an instant. The whole film just really touches you emotionally on so many different levels. It was bitter sweet!",Remember Me

They say that the plot is centered on the two lovers but to us it seemed more like it was centered on 2 families' dramas. We were expecting a romantic movie but we were watching family problems... The romance was centered more on the bed than elsewhere. We imagine romance a bit different. OK, there were some nice romantic scenes but they were always disrupted by the next scenes that were centered on Tyler's family problems... I say the movie's main topic was Tyler's family, NOT the new two lovers.And the 911 in the end was ridiculous. He could die but not in the 911 event. It was totally out of topic. Then they killed the main hero (like it was written in another review)... I saw no point in this movie. It was already hardly watchable because me and my friend couldn't understanding the main topic, what were they trying to show exactly, I was trying to see something, like the little sister's problems and how she was getting support but the ending of the movie destroyed it all. Destroyed any meaning that there was in this movie. And that 22 years age at which both brothers died wasn't necessary. Ridiculous. It was a complete tragic drama which seems meaningless to me. Why to make such a movie I don't understand. What's the point of seeing everyone die, what's the point of watching destroyed lives? After such movie you just feel depressed and disappointed.

After the movie was started, and I saw Robert's face, I thought ""O my God, I wasted my money."" - how untruth. After ""watching"" Twilight, I totally lost my respect for Robert's acting (I had some after watching his role in Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire). A totally white bloodsucker, with role that was so stupid that I can't even get what the teens see in the movie ... That was my review of the Twilight. I just hoped that Remember Me won't be some boring, teen romance/drama/comedy that will just waste two hours of my life. But, just after fifteen minutes of the movie, I could't lie my self : I'm totally in this ! You may not believe me, but even breath didn't hear in the cinema while watching the movie. Even few minutes after ending, everyone was just looking at the screen and screaming in them self : ""We want more ! ! !"". Acting actually wasn't acting ... It was like he living that role. For someone it will maybe took some time to realize what's the story about, but for me it was clear when Tyler went to jail. Really touching, I can't say love story because, for me, love isn't main focus in this movie, but I can say film, with extremely good acting. Now, Robert is actually actor. I just hope that Twilight is just bad episode in his life, and that we will see much more movies like Remember Me from him.

80,sfiver,A shout out for young Ruby Jerins,3,17 April 2011,"The film is surprisingly watchable. As in most films the conclusion is worth wading through most of the 113 minutes. Since most reviewers have already provided the plot, story, etc., my interest was the rather unique bonding between Tyler, played well by Robert Pattinson, and his 11-year old sister, Caroline, played to a perfect pitch by Ruby Jerins. The scenes they have together are most memorable and probably worth your time.Pierce Brosnan as the father, Charles Hawkins, a corporate chieftain is underplayed by Brosnan. To add to his dismal performance his Brooklyn accent is mumbled British making his character even more unbelievable.Fortunately, a good supporting cast with notable performances by Kate Burton as Brosnan's secretary, and Tate Ellington as Pattinson's hyper-active roommate also help surf this piece.Emile de Ravin is cast as Ally Craig, Tyler's girlfriend. I can't blame her for a wickedly poor performance. It makes me wonder if her character (and plot line) was thrown in during filming so Pattinson's character would have a ""love interest."" I blame the director for no guidance what-so-ever.3/10 as it is watchable especially Pattinson and young Ruby Jerins.",Remember Me
81,WHYeat,Bro-Approved,7,31 March 2010,"Ladies and gentleman, Robert Pattinson at his best! That's right. He does a lot of brooding and watches women as they sleep and he looks good doing it. That's talent Despite my preconceptions, this move turned out a little better than I thought. That just goes to show that if your expectations are low, you won't be disappointed. OK, so I'm not exactly who you should come to for life advice, but maybe Gandhi's words will compensate for my verbal blunders.""Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it."" The movie starts and ends with those words, so be mindful of them and the movie will mean more. Also, the screenplay tries quite hard to be meaningful and clever. It somewhat succeeds with a bit of foreshadow, but fumbles with two aspects. First, I just don't understand why Tyler (Robert Pattinson) overreacts to everything. In one scene, I seriously thought he was gonna punch a 10 year old girl in the face. Who reacts this way? He's supposed to be troubled and misunderstood, but why is he over-the-top insane? Second, I personally don't see any added value of having the love interest, Ally (Emilie de Ravin). It's more of a distraction than anything.The beginning and end are decent, even though you can see the ending coming from a mile away. (Hint: When does this movie take place?)

So I did not have any expectations when I went in the hall for this movie. But I came out completely satisfied, and I think I would not have liked the other movie I was trying to see, better than this one, anyway.If you normally are a kind of person who likes the type of movies with lot of things happening around, then better stay away from this movie. Why I say this is because couple of my friends who came with me to the hall, did not like the movie at all, for the same reason. This movie hardly have any thing big happening in it, except for the last few minutes. All other part of the movie is very light, with a lot of very touching romantic and family moments.As the hero says in the movie, this movie is all about a concept ""Whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it's very important that you do it because nobody else will.""All the actors were excellent, but I have to especially mention two names. One is Pierce Brosnan, who looked extremely stylish and professional, as always. He added an extra charm to the role and made me think that no body else could have done this role better. Second is the girl who acted as the hero's sister. She was very cute and touching the hearts in every scenes she appear, with her brilliant acting and expressions.By the way, in many of the close up scenes I felt that there is some thing wrong with the shape/look of Emilie de Ravin's hand, I mean the part below her elbow till palm. Did anybody else notice the same?There were some parts of the movie where I started to think that movie is loosing focus and going here and there. But at the end there was a good surprise and then we could correlate everything happened around and everything had a purpose. At then end when the movie finished, there was a very pin drop silence in the hall, since every body was in a very different mood, touched by the movie. So the script writer and the director could be proud that they did their job very well. I thought of standing up and clapping for them.In short, it is a light family + romantic story taken in a very soft way with a lot of good acting in it.

86,moossaboossa,Unexpectedly Beautiful,10,7 February 2011,"If memory serves me right, the poster for Remember Me was featured alongside a Twilight ""Edward"" cut out in my local cinema. As much as the Vampire-Romance saga had entertained me, I had all but assumed that Remember Me would be yet another teenage chick-flick. Especially considering some of the reviews it had received, which contained words such as 'Pitiful' and 'Predictable'. It was for this reason, that I decided against this movie, and chose some other less than average blockbuster. The last week Remember Me was showing, I read on a website that it was an Independent movie and that Pierce Brosnan also starred alongside Emilie De Ravin and Robert Pattinson. I reluctantly payed the admission cost, and in an empty cinema readied myself for a tiresome display of pitiful acting.I admit, hands down, totally ashamed, that I was wrong. Wrong to judge this film, or the capacity of the performance. This movie is heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and totally unpredictable. The acting is credible, and every time I watch it, which is more than often, I can't help but cry at all that's wrong in the world. This movie stayed with me long after the ending credits, and it left me with an uneasy and depressing feeling in the pit of my stomach.Robert Pattinson plays a lost and unfortunate character. Son of a rich, seemingly heartless man and brother to a deceased victim of suicide. He has no goal and life and wonders idly from day to day, carrying the burden of his lost brother and his severed relationship with his Father (Pierce Brosnan). On a night out, he involves himself in a fight outside a bar. Caught up in the moment, he punches a policeman and is jailed for the night. When his Father disapprovingly bales him out, Robert Pattinson decides to vindicate himself by dating the police man's daughter and breaking her heart. However, Robert Pattinson falls for the girl, played by Emilie De Ravin. The ending of the movie is like a punch in the gut, I won't spoil it but I can certainly say I did not expect it. I've recommended this movie to many people, and will continue to do so. I'm just about to watch it again, so I'll leave at the risk of ruining my computer with the inevitable tears.",Remember Me

Before that he could've been a serial killer in disguise, a hopeless soul wanting to go down the same path as his brother who committed suicide or just a spoiled rich kid without scruples that was trying to get back at the cop who had beaten him. Only in the last part of the movie you figure out he's just a guy trying to do right by his little sister and the people he loves and coping with the frustration he feels towards his father. The twists and turns of the storyline i thought were really exciting aswel. At one point i even thought that Tyler was a clone of his older brother Michael that committed suicide because of some subtle hints regarding stem cell research.

I'm not a fan of ""Twilight,"" so I thought any he would be in would probably be cheesy. My mother saw this movie last week, so she told me that it was sad, but to watch it. I decided to go ahead and go for it.From the beginning, the movie resonated with me. As someone who lost a loved one, I saw at once that life and death were the main themes of the movie. Both Ally (played by the lovely Emilie de Ravin) and Tyler (Robert Pattison) lost loved ones in tragic ways. Ally saw her mother being murdered right in front of her eyes, and Tyler lost his older brother who committed suicide. It's one of the reasons that they come together.Side note: Ally's mother was played by Martha Plimpton. I loved her in the 80s! She was River Phoenix's girlfriend. If you are an 80s kid, I know you saw ""The Goonies"" and ""Mosquito Coast."" She was awesome.I was impressed by Pattison's acting. I really felt this was the role for him, and he did it well. When the ""Twilight"" series ends, I can see a future for him. The only thing I worry about is that he will be typecast as the brooding loner with ""issues.""Rubi Jerins, who played Pattinson's sister, did an amazing job. She was convincing as an artistic, shy girl who was being bullied by the popular girls at school. My heart ached for her. When you feel for a character, this is when you know that she was successful.Both life and death affect people's lives. They change everything about you. Emotionally and mentally. It even changes your surroundings, including the people in it. However, the movie's message is true. This is a big world, and you might feel insignificant because you might think ""What can I do?"" However, even if you feel that way, you still need to try to do something. You might think it means nothing to others, but you are wrong.

Forcing a messy shock factor ruins the synergy of the whole plot. If this was a social-life, realistic type of movie I might even support the writers decisions to have your audience think deeply about life but to me this seemed like a failed attempt to be different which is really a missed opportunity to tell a wonderfully heart-warming romantic story.
What I loved about the story was the surprisingly impressive supporting characters,Tyler's friend, Ally's dad and particularly Tyler's relationship with his little sister reminded me of The Catcher in the Rye protagonist Holden Caulfield.

Somehow I managed not to walk out until clear through the credits. The one percent, however, left me thunderstruck. That ratcheted the film up two more notches for me. I guess if the film had been any less tedious for the first 90 minutes, the moment of revelation would not have been so powerful, by contrast.My advice to prospective viewers is this: if you are going to start this film, then stick with it. The message will actually make sense, and Pierce Brosnon will actually redeem himself as a serious actor.Not being a Rob-fan, I went into this film with no preconceptions.

I thought it would be your average love story after watching the trailer, handsome boy with problems, falls for a good looking girl with problems and they live happily ever after, however, I couldn't have been more surprised by what actually happens in this film and what it is about. This movie is so much more than a cheesy love story with a good looking cast. It explores a number of themes, how to deal with the death of a loved one, how an experience can dictate your whole life, how you never know what is going on in another person's life, how bullying can cause people to be so introverted, how no matter how bad a relationship becomes with your parents they always love you, and so much more! Not often do I watch a movie and think, yeah I liked everything about that film, but with this one, its exactly what I thought! Even if you disregard the amazing story, the acting alone makes this a 10 out of 10 movie. Pattinson, no matter what people say, can act. He displays this throughout this entire movie,not at one point did i become bored or feel he didn't suit this part.He makes his character so real and so believable, and for me, it is one of the best acting displays I've ever seen in a movie. De Ravin, a relatively unknown actress, is also perfect in this role and makes her character totally likable and you can almost feel all the emotion her character must feel, through her performance.The chemistry between the two is simply breath-taking. Ruby Jerins also puts in a fine display as Pattinson's younger sister, while Brosnan is extremely creditable as Pattinson's characters dad.

The intentions did not matter, it was doomed, the critics slammed it.We have a love story between 2 damaged people - a girl and a boy. They connect through their similar experience with loss of close relatives. In both cases, it was sudden and forceful, leaving them to deal with the irreversible trauma of witnessing it. One chose to forget it, while the other chose to embrace it. At the end, the writer folds us in the story by incorporating an equally sudden, relatively recent event from our ""outer"" reality. It works. As the lights are about to fade, we connect with the girl through recollection of trauma,10 years after witnessing it. A very interesting trick that we very rarely see simply because of the limited shared conscious memory of an audience.This could have been better with any other fictitious event, provided the appropriate cues are present for us to create an allusion ourselves.

I loved every moment up until the end. I didn't need a happily-ever-after ending, and this movie doesn't have a happily-ever-after ending. I strongly object to the tool used to create the un-happy ending. That tool overshadows everything that came before and turned the movie into being about the event instead of the characters. I was actually really angry when I left the theater, which disappointed me because I was soooo enjoying the journey up to that point.I thought all the actors were true and real. I'm very happy to see that R Pattinson can immerse himself and act, and the hype isn't just for the 'tweens (no offense). It's a shame there's all this backlash because of his career up to this point since I think people will miss out on the true beginning of a talent to be watched. Pierce Brosnan - hands down - A-maz-ing!! His turn in this is reminiscent of his amazing talent displayed in The Matador.There are a number of continuity issues that I ignored, but still caught (and I rarely do). I also think the director made a few missteps and missed some opportunities, but that's neither here nor there now that it's out.My advice is see the movie if you enjoy character studies and indies (let's face it, this is an indie film wrapped up as a studio pic), but be prepared to feel manipulated or ripped-off or whatever at the end.",Remember Me

I didn't really know what was really going on until a quarter way through, and that's when it got really interesting. You get to know the characters pretty well, their backgrounds, family, and their outlooks on life.Pattinson does an amazing job as Tyler, a struggling college student dealing with his brother's recent suicide. Emilie de Ravin does a great job as well playing Allie Craig, also a college student who is haunted by witnessing her mother's murder when she was little. When these two meet each other, they soon find out that they have many things in common and understand each others pain. Soon after though, the secrets that Tyler keeps from Allie come out and puts a huge strain on their relationship.

The whole cast was very good...The story line was tense and the intermittent ""comic relief"" moments were well placed. I sat spell bound through the entire movie. The reason I gave this movie a nine out of ten vote, was only because, I wondered through out the movie why Tyler father was such a mean spirited man...I found myself trying to analyze and speculate which deterred me from the main plot of the movie at times. Naturally, it comes together towards the end, but I think that it would of been better if his ""coldness"" were more defined earlier on. I read Lisa Schwarzbaums review in EW, and was a bit mystified as to why she felt compelled to keep comparing Tyler to Edward. Maybe Ms Schwarzbaum is a little too enamored of Edward to give a unbiased opinion. I hope that other people who might read her review won't be swayed as to whether or not they will see the movie.

It is obvious that the writer thought to himself ""Hmmm, they've got to get from point A to point B, how can I do that in the least amount of time possible?"" The result is that, as your getting to like the characters and feel for their situations, the script goes a$$-backwards for a few minutes, only to right itself. I'll only describe one example--the opening scene, so it really doesn't count as a spoiler. A girl and her mother are waiting on a subway platform. Two men steal the mother's purse then get on the train. For some reason, the door to the subway closes and then opens again, and the thief shoots the mother--FOR NO GOOD REASON. The only explanation for this behaviour is that the man is a psychopath. But since this movie isn't about him, why waste the audience's energy trying to decipher his motivation? The whole scene is pointless. All the major plot points in this movie develop that way. Yet in between nonsensical behaviour, the characters are quite likable, and we're enjoying watching Tyler and Aly fall in love, and then ----WHAM! ""Hold on! I'm confused. Has he been like this all the time or is it an isolated incident? Why did he do that?""-- --In my attempts to maintain spoiler free I didn't describe the scenario, but lets just say it came out of the blue and exists solely so that Aly can move in with Tyler, and is then forgotten. The movie goes back to functioning rationally, only to be screwed over again and again by ridiculous plot twists to get the ball rolling. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say it's depressing. Not just sad...depressing. Ultimately, I was glad I saw this movie because when its good it is quite good. Most of the characters are interesting enough that I would have liked the writer to flesh them out, rather than fall back on epic clichés in moments of crisis. I'll tell you again, though. This movie is depressing. Titanic is sad. Shakespeare in love is sad. This movie is depressing. Consider yourself warned.",Remember Me

Now i went to see this movie with hesitation I admit, but only because I knew what a lousy actor Pattison was and how those vampire movies sucked! I went to see it with a friend of mine, because of two reasons: 1. I felt bored and 2. It was a drama and not a romantic flick and 3. Pierce Brosnan. The first moments of the film showed me that this movie might be interesting and it was. Robert has finally showed some skills in acting and I cannot imagine someone else in his role. The problem was that his role shaded all of the other ones including the one of his girlfriend. That is a big flaw but it is one appreciated giving how he used to suck in acting. The movie felt very modern without any kind of cheesy chick-flick moments and the drama was very intense! It rose from the very sad beginning to the very sad end.

Tyler being so happy that things were starting to change after his brothers death ... his father paying attention to his sister, Ally forgiving him ... and for the the first time in a LONG time, he had hope for his future. only to be snuffed out ... and changing the course of everyone's lives forever.i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing on 09/11/01 - but to view the event from the perspective of the people who were right there, the split second decisions that put them where fate intended them to be ... is so surreal.Robert Pattinson is an amazing actor. i will admit that i originally selected the movie from Netflix based upon trailers i had seen on the Twilight DVDs, and wanting to see more of Robert. i was incredibly surprised at his abilities to make me forget him as Edward Cullen - and see him as a tormented Tyler Hawkins. his emotions - pain, sorrow, angst, passion, joy ... all came across with incredible realism. i FELT what Tyler felt.Chris Cooper - goes without saying. not a huge fan of Pierce Brosnan but he, too, played his character extremely well. Emilie de Ravin as Ally and Ruby Jerins as Caroline also did an amazing job.i am quite surprised i had not heard more about this film and do not understand it's ""Razzie Award"" as worst actor for Robert. apparently the viewers didn't let themselves feel.an extremely underrated movie and goes to show that people shouldn't give credence to film critics.",Remember Me
106,alisterblack22,"Not so bad... oh, oh my god! What... why?",1,18 March 2010,"The entire film, I was deeply annoyed. For one, I thought Pattinson would be able to pull a Zac Efron and play something he didn't straight out of his infamously bad (within the movie community, not within little girls, so please don't bother arguing for Twilight). Maybe, with a good movie, he could prevent typecasting. The only change here was that he didn't glitter. The entire film was him pulling off an awful accent (as did everyone) and brooding. If I wanted to see him sad and sulky in a poorly written and obvious film, then I'd watch Twilight (no, but I'd never do that again). And the worst part is they knew it would be obvious, so they threw in THAT ending. I won't say it, because it's technically a spoiler, but it's in the parental advisory thing if you want to find out. The point is it was offensive, not that it's not allowed in films, but in a film this bad in a way that really wasn't needed, I just felt like it was disrespectful. And the Tate Ellington character that was supposed to be the comedic relief from all of Robert Pattison bitching, well, they tried to make the character funny, but you just ended up hating him just as much because he wasn't funny and he was just obnoxious. Pierce Brosnan (in an equally awkward accent) had one of two decent scenes. His was the much needed yelling at Pattinson, letting Pattinson know that he's annoying. And the other scene was one involving Pattinson bitching out a little girl (his equal match). All of the pleasure you may get out of this film (if you aren't some stupidly desperate teenager who believes that Robert Pattinson makes good movies simply because he was a vampire once) will be destroyed by the end. If you really liked the ending, you missed the point or your mind has been hypnotized by Pattinson's ""dreaminess."" Which he doesn't have. His eyebrows scare me.Don't see it, is the point.",Remember Me
107,rainbowpoet,"A beautifully structured, engaging masterpiece",10,14 March 2010,"This film, definitely Robert Pattinson's most profound, is not to be taken or experienced lightly. It is a heavy drama that is less about romance than it is about family loss amidst tragedy. It is also the first film to surprise me in a very long time. I had no idea how it would conclude until about three minutes from the ending, which absolutely blew me away.I went to see it with my girlfriend, and we had been waiting for it for a long time. We both expected it to be good, but what we were really hoping for was a Pattinson performance that demonstrated something beyond the level of range exhibited in his interpretation of Stephanie Meyer's lackluster anti-hero Edward Cullen. Needless to say, we got a lot more than we bargained for. Shockingly, not only did Pattinson easily eclipse both Pierce Brosnan's and Chris Cooper's performances as the two ""fathers"" of the story, which were both excellent, but he gave us something we will remember for a very long time. This is definitely the most powerful film I have seen in theaters over the past year. It reaches far beyond the limited emotional scope of ""bigger"" releases such as 'Avatar' or 'Shutter Island', both of which are disastrously overrated. What 'Remember Me' accomplishes with its riveting, no-holds-barred storytelling and its brilliant final sequence is a feat rarely, if ever, attempted so tastefully. It connects us with so many aspects of our reality, our own world, and our own history, that many of us try not to face. It forces us to examine what certain significant events mean in the progression of our lives and the lives of our families and friends. It examines how we relate to one another in both the simplest and most complex of our relationships. It ties our daily lives together with the unexpected, which is something that is often unavoidable whether we are prepared for it or not. And it provides us with some insight as to how to deal with our hardships in life. It doesn't give us all the answers, as no film or book or story of any kind could ever do, but it certainly inspires us to ask the tough questions.",Remember Me

The performances from every actor were purely amazing, but in my opinion it was little Caroline that took my breath away the most, the character was just so emotional you walk out of the cinema feeling protective of your own little sister or brother because of the truly emotional situations she's put through. I agree with a few of the other people on here, you really should't go see this film if you're depressed because you will not leave feeling any better, but if you're up for a good tearjerker and a few shocks, then this is the film for you. Not to leave out the leads either, they did well and the roles were cast perfectly, RPatz plays brooding and pensive well, and Emily DeRavine did fantastically playing the troubled teen with a horrific past, their chemistry was just something else.

112,golden-silence,Not bad..but not great,7,13 March 2010,"Based on the trailer, I went in dreading the fact that I may not enjoy his movie. And I was right. There was nothing special about the movie. There were a lot of awkward silences and hardly any chemistry between the little girl (Ruby Jerins) and Tyler. Before you all get mad, I thought their relationship was adorable, especially when Tyler was so protective of Caroline, but when I saw them together, I thought something was missing between them. But that minor detail is hardly a bad point about this movie.The acting was just OK. Not superb. Rob did GREAT at some points and others, not so much. The scene that did give me goosebumps was when he was yelling to his on-screen Dad. That was incredibly acted. I was SO PROUD of him at the moment. Other times, he would sound like he was mumbling... I think his transition from a British accent to an American one really compromises his acting. Not just playing Tyler but also as Edward. Especially as Edward. but I will not go there right now.The ending of the movie was ... the best and worst part. I think. It was so REAL. I wish they'd actually shown the events cuz that would have made such a huge impact. But the way they did was still intense. And so heart-breaking. I did cry...but then I cry at anything remotely sad. It was pretty obvious it was gonna happen cuz death was the underlying theme from the very beginning of the movie. And then showing what and where everyone was right before it happened...*shudder*. However, it was also totally useless. There were already two deaths in the movie, a third was uncalled for.Pierce, Emilie and Tate Ellington all acted brilliantly. Tate - for a newcomer was especially believable as Aidan. Ruby (as Caroline) was freaking CUTE. All in all, the acting was very believable but the script at some points was weak. I wouldn't go see it again but I'll definitely buy it when it comes to DVD. And I also think watching it a second time might make me like it a little more.Kudos to Rob because he managed to do a lot better than a lot of people (including myself) gave him credit for.

This movie had such an obvious cloud hanging over it, but it made the characters develop wonderfully. The relationship between Rpatz and Caroline was sooo cute! Anyone who is willing to scare the ever living God out of a vicious 11 year old girl is a great big brother in my mind. The dynamic between Tyler and his father in the office shouting scene was incredible. It reminds you to tell people how much they really mean to you while you have the chance.The way the ending was done was very beautifully classic. I have not seen the buildings portrayed that way since before Sept 11th happened. The fact that they showed aftermath and reaction instead of showing a plane hit was very well done. My husband is military and he goes overseas because of that happening and he was very impressed. The American people don't need to watch it over and over again. This was very well done.

114,trims,"Interesting, but not great...",6,25 April 2011,"I just saw this on TV - it was on Showtime, and I had some time. Note that I've not see Pattinson before, and am decidedly not in the demographic for this movie.The script is a bit of a mess, with some leaps and jerks in scenes that detract from the moods, and some very noticeable lack of background in key areas. Pattinson's character's family (excepting the younger sister) are basically 2D cutouts. Attempts to give the father some depth fall flat in the end. De Ravin is pretty without being saccharine, though the script really fails to give her something to make us understand the character. Her character's tragedy doesn't seem to effect her (or, have any definition or reflection in her), unlike her father's.As far as the acting goes, well, its OK. Most of the actors do a good job with the rather slim material they're given - it's certainly not their fault their characters aren't well described. I did like the little sister, though, and noticed the actress did a good job of underplaying the part, which is difficult for a 11-year-old. I can't tell if it was Pattinson or the role, but, the brooding/depressive/coy thing doesn't really stick well. It feels false.All that said, the themes of the film were strong, and relatively well thought out. Thematically, this was a well-executed story, with just about the right amount of anger, pathos, and redemption.*** Spoiler *** Unlike others, I think the final coda of the movie is appropriate, and not exploitative. I don't think it was to make any sort of political point, rather, it was to advance the plot thread of tragedy and recovery. Honestly, it was just as appropriate as would having him die in some accident, with the overtone of casting the family's tragedy as a microcosm of what every victim's family of the event might have gone through.Overall, this is a hard movie to get excited about. Pattinson fans aren't really going to get the thematic elements, and the mediocre script isn't sufficient for the acting talent. There's a good movie in there somewhere, but it needed a better director and screenwriter than it got.",Remember Me

117,Krisp8888,A wonderfully made movie,8,9 July 2010,"*No Spoilers in this Review.*I was pleasantly surprised by this one. This was a very good film.The film starts off like a bittersweet love story. Tyler is a troubled young man who recently lost his brother to suicide. His parents are divorced and his relationship with his father is not a good one. The one person who he truly connects with in his family is his younger sister, Caroline. After a run in with the Law- Tyler tries to get back at the cop who busted his face by getting involved with the cops daughter, Ally. Ally witnessed her mothers brutal murder 10 years earlier after a mugging gone bad. Things change when Tyler begins Falling for Ally.This is not a Love story alone though. Family Values are heavily portrayed in this film along with other very intriguing sub plots. The film has a very nice pace to it and I love the overall style of the film. The ending I felt was a great fit- as it portrayed reality. It portrayed how the families changed because of what happened and gave the film meaning, depth. The issue is that the trailer makes the film out to be a bright, feel good, love story- and it is a bit deceiving. It is a very serious, dark film, with a inner beauty to it. I would have liked more ""Happy"" Moments- but this film is not ""Happy"" in the least. And you need to know that going in. This is a film that heavily involves tragedy- and you have to know that going in. What this film is, is wonderfully made. It is a story about Love, Family, Life, Death, and how one person can change the lives of everyone around them.The Plot is smooth. The cinematography is great. And the Music is wonderfully composed. A well made, well written, well acted film for anybody who likes a realistic film that deals with real issues.

Why people, who didn't give life to a person kill him? They have no rights to do that. When I saw the poster of this movie the first time, I said: «No. I don't want to watch it. I don't want to watch a movie with Robert Pattinson, a sweet vampire from ""The Twilight""  to watch this movie only because of him? No, I will not do that!». At the beginning of March I went to the cinema to watch another movie and.. I saw the trailer of «Remember me». When I saw that the main role there is given to Emilie de Ravin, to this beautiful Claire from «LOST», I said: «Yes! I will watch this movie!». And I watched it in the first day of release. I was waiting for another theme and another plot, but what I saw was much more than I expected to see. I changed my attitude to Robert Pattinson. After two movies with him which I watched - «The Twilight» and «Harry Potter», I was completely sure that he has no talent to be an actor. He didn't look as an actor. The boy was just learning how to play. That day I changed my mind. The role of Edward Cullen is not his any more for me. I saw one guy, who loved his little sister Caroline so much, who tried to struggle for justice, he hated his father, and he didn't want to fall in love, he just wanted the revenge, but he felt in love. His acting was awesome. My flesh crept, I was shivering, I was worried about this guy, I was afraid. I had so much emotions... And, finally, his acting made me cry. Emilie de Ravin. She is beautiful. She is a very lovely actress, which gave all her heart to this role, to Ellie, the daughter of policeman. When I saw her smiling, I smiled. When she cried — I cried too. Emilie and Robert - this couple is much better than Stewart and Pattinson. I saw love in this movie. A real love. Three little girls in the cinema sat behind me and they laughed all the movie long. I wanted to kill these girls. Yes, there are some humorous moment in this movie, but they laughed when everybody cried. They do not know, what a real love means, and how it is difficult to play. They saw only their little sweetie cutie Edward Cullen — I am happy, but it is bad because they didn't see Tayler. The end of the movie. When I saw the black screen I understood - something happened. It was like a big full stop. There was a woman near me,and I saw that she cried. Like me. I rarely cry in the cinema. But that day I cried. This movie is awesome. 10 / 10",Remember Me

121,ptdlugosz,I won't remember you. Cause I really don't want to.,3,4 June 2010,"""Remember Me"", is a story of soon-to-be 22 Tyler (played by Robert Paterson) who's as undecided about his college major as about his life.Sleep-walking through the New York City of 2001, reminiscing about his dead brother (who took his life at 22), Tyler looks for a way to act out his teenage angst overlapping into his early 20's. Smoking excessively can only get you so far It just so happens, that one night, he comes across a street fight, in which he cannot help getting involved in. As the police arrives at the scene, simply dispersing BOTH the attackers and the assaulted, Tyler lives up to his rebelliousness and questions the Sergeants decision (played by Chris Copper) which leads to a night in jail.Soon after, thanks to divine providence, he finds out that the cop's daughter, Ally, (portrayed by Emillie de Raven) goes to the same school and pushed by a friend (played by Tate Ellington) becomes romantically involved with her so she can be later dumped as a way to pay for her father's injustice.As Ally and Taylor get closer to each other, it turns they have a lot more in common than they ever expected. Tragic events, over and under protective fathers, apparently make for a long-lasting relationship, where Taylor's over impulsive reactions to his emotionally distanced father (played by the book by Pierce Brosnan) becomes the movie's main attraction / struggle. It's a chance for Patterson to look menacing, mumble away words, and use his sharp tongue. Miss playing Edward much? Patterson tries to pull of ""Rebel without a cause"" with a hint of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" thought the entire film. It works sporadically, as with the bowl-ashtray scene that completes the room, but mainly – it's a miss. Although the bond that he has with his 11-year old sister (played by the gifted child actress Ruby Jerins), who's as lost as he is – just at a different stage of her life, helped me endure the film's remains.I'll even dare to say that her performance outmatches Patterson's. She won me over with screen truthfulness.Not since Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"" has New York gotten such a personal treatment, where it shapes its residents existence. It's a very down to earth look, that's doesn't take away the attention from the movie's plot. In fact – it enhances it. It felt as if someone shot the film in my backyard.Because New York is a city of opportunity, it would make sense that this young man, who's struggling with his direction if life, finds himself in the city that other flocks to in order to find meaning.Remember Me, could have been much more effective as a mini-series. And considering the director's experience in that field, it clearly shows the route he took while shooting was misfitting. Breaking down the story into vignettes instead of cramming it all together would have allowed for more attention, thought and consideration.I thought that this movie would be a golden opportunity to take out all the Twilight puns, but the ending disarmed me completely No build up. No foreshadowing. No reason for it to be there. Allen Coulter, I hope you'll spend the following weeks repenting for your ""twist"" ending You've turned a national tragedy into a cheap, popcorn-indulging, filler.Did the whole idea of mourning had to be brought down to the ""on-screen sacrifice""? That death, somehow, makes the people left behind appreciate each other more? Ugh.",Remember Me

123,Xianghong,"Contrary to what the movie title implores, we're not likely to remember it.",7,2 February 2015,"Let's be honest: Remember Me is all about giving Robert Pattinson a chance to show off his acting chops. We should really applaud RPattz's (what Pattinson is affectionately known as by the press) efforts to break out of his brooding dreamboat typecast from Twilight. He smokes! He drinks! He has sex before marriage! OMG! Much like how the Harry Potter franchise has evolved, tween fans would do well to prepare themselves for a dark side of their idol they've never seen before.It's always a risk when casting actors famous for their portrayal of previous roles. Other than the obvious problem of trying to shake off RPattz's image as a sparkling vampire, I had a hard time re- imagining Emilie de Ravin as That Pregnant Chick from Lost and trying to forget Pierce Brosnan's nightmare inducing attempts to sing from Mama Mia. To the credit of the cast and director, a generally solid performance and competent directing successfully brings an otherwise somewhat plodding script to life. I found the soundtrack to be tasteful and appropriate as well.This love story is simple, often pushing the limits of clichÃ (C). Pattinson plays Tyler, a college student with anger management issues due to his brother committing suicide because of their emotionally distant father (Pierce Brosnan). He is goaded by his rascal of a roommate to bait and ditch a classmate, Ally (Emilie de Ravin), for revenge due to being thrown into jail by her cop father (Chris Cooper) after getting into fisticuffs with strangers outside a bar.It turns out (naturally) that Ally has daddy issues of her own and the two leads fall in (and out) of love predictably as they struggle to deal with other family dysfunctions such as teenage angst and single parenthood. The young stars exhibit genuine chemistry - to the credit of the effort evidently put in by the leads (though being extraordinarily good looking contributes too, I suppose) - and makes their romance believable.So, can Robert Pattinson act? Certainly - if the role is appropriate. He's no James Dean of course, but then this ain't the fifties either. Of particular note is 11-year-old Ruby Jerins, who plays Pattinson's psychologically messed up younger sister, Caroline. Her convincing performance contributed to the building up of some of the film's most emotionally charged scenes and helped to justify much of the oft heavy-handed melodrama. Veteran actors Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper also provide the much needed gravitas to anchor the film, preventing it from descending into farce.Many critics have condemned this movie for the shock twist ending alone. I can certainly understand their outrage, though I am personally ambivalent about the usage of such plot devices. On one hand, it did evoke a strong feeling of pathos but on the other hand, it felt rather contrived after the credits started rolling. Perhaps the most dismal part of this movie is that contrary to what its title implores, we're not likely to remember it.",Remember Me

In case of Remember Me its the former.The movie starts as every other Hollywood movie where a mother is killed in front of her daughter while waiting for the subway in a deserted station, but the movie takes a turn there after. The director has introduced the characters in an unique way, it takes time to realise their true persona.The movie is packed with emotional twists,and the actors portray them in subtle ways throughout the movie. Thought the movie rolls a bit slow, which is entirely necessary for the emotions in the scenes to sink in the audiences mind, at the end it leaves you traumatised and makes you keep thinking about the movie and the characters for a long time.Its a perfect film for a Romantic evening which gives you somethin to discuss with your partner at the end.",Remember Me
126,brothersatan-1,Made me stop hating Robert.,9,3 September 2010,I was messing around on the internet and read about this film and read about the ending of it after hearing about the ending i really wanted to see it. One of the best films I've seen in years the only problem was i found out about the ending before i watched the film BIGGEST mistake ever!!! but even tho i knew how it would end i was still shocked. the rest of the film was amazing also it draws you in to the characters more than any film I've seen in forever I don't think i blinked once i was that sucked in. i hate twilight i think its such a knock off of Buffy and also kinda Roswell if you watch it you will know what i mean but that doesn't mean Robert Pattinson is bad as well i unfairly judged him because of twilight he is a really good actor. everyone go and see this film but whatever you do don't read about what happens in it go in to it blind sit throw it all you will be very happy you did!,Remember Me
127,MReed542,"Remember Me - Unfortunately disappointing. C minus. Sorry, Rob",3,15 March 2010,"""Remember Me"" – the title of the movie Robert Pattinson chose to star in as his first step away from the Twilight world. After watching this movie on opening night, with high hopes for this charming young hunk, I wondered if the title itself was what drew Rob to the project. Was he trying to say, ""God, PLEASE remember me! (Because I know that fame is fleeting and you all are going to turn on me any minute!)""? I suspect that after opening weekend, he would like to change the title to ""Remember Me as Edward Cullen and please forget you ever saw me in this movie."" But it wasn't all bad. The last 8 minutes of this movie are so powerful and so emotion-evoking that I would almost recommend sitting through the other 2 hours just to see the ending. Almost. I'm sure the ending was one of the things that drew Pattinson to Executive Produce this film however, the 2 hours leading up to it are so slow and so melodramatic and so predictable and so cliché that by the time you get to the great ending you don't care the way the writer intended you to.Curiously, the ending actually feels disconnected from the rest of the movie - as if someone else filmed and edited the ending and it belonged to a different really good movie. I felt like all the pieces were there to make it good, but it just didn't have enough substance. Or something. I found myself trying to understand why it didn't work because on paper it should have worked. It's a story of a young man whose brother tragically dies. He closes himself off in anger and isolation until he meets a girl that awakens him and helps him to love again. I personally never get tired of such drivel, but for some reason this just didn't work.I'm having trouble admitting it, but I have to admit the blame falls primarily to the weak acting skills of Robert Pattinson. I'm not sure why other reviewers are dancing around this fact, but his performance was weak and self-indulgent and so guarded there was no way you were cracking through that skin to get to that character's heart. I wanted to love him in this. I really did, but I found myself thinking that this could have been a good movie in a good actor's hands.Even the strong performances all around him didn't help and it was actually an odd thing to watch. It was like everyone was acting AROUND him yet he never actually interacted or acted WITH them. Unfortunately, it caused you to not understand or care about the character. This character, in a seasoned actor's hands could have been heart-wrenching and the ending would have left you sobbing for hours. As it was, it was boring and Pattinson's character unlikeable and flat.His character (Tyler) smokes, drinks, and mopes his way through life and instead of caring you just want to bathe him and bleach his pigsty of an apartment and tell him to stop complaining that he has a father who gladly bails him out of bad situations and pays his rent so he can mope around not working while studying sociology.But it's not fair to place the blame completely on Pattinson. The director and the writer can share some of the failure. For example, Pattinson's character (Tyler) goes through the typical ""I'm angry at the world and shut off until I fell in love and now I'm going to make up with my father"" but you just don't see the transition and you're left asking yourself ""why is he better now? Did I miss a scene?"" And there's not really enough back-story for you to really understand the characters' motivations so you never really feel involved in their lives even though you desperately want to be. The script could have used a few more drafts and some expert eyes.The one place I can't place blame is on the supporting cast. They all worked so hard on their individual characters that they must have been exhausted at the end of the day trying to make this movie work. Chris Cooper stands out as probably the best performance as the father of Pattinson's love interest, Ally. His character was cliché but he made it a very intense and real performance. Pierce Brosnan plays Tyler's high powered business man father perfectly. In one scene Brosnan tells his executives to ""sit the f*** down"" and I felt compelled to sit very still in my seat for fear of retribution. Lina Olin, one of my all time favorite actresses was wonderful as Tyler's mother and Tate Ellington as Tyler's roommate provided some much needed comic relief. Tyler's little sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins) was sweet and for whatever reason was the closest anyone got in the film to connecting with Pattinson. They were ALMOST really cute together. Emilie De Ravin was well cast as a daughter of a cop raised without a mom in New York, but she was working so hard to connect with Pattinson that I was exhausted watching her. Her character too, has a tragedy she's living with but it just doesn't seem to be a real factor in anything she does.I wanted so badly to go back in time, take Rob Pattinson aside and suggest strongly that if he really wanted to put his money into this film that he should let a seasoned actor play the lead. It might have worked. Unfortunately, I just don't think he's quite ready to play a lead and it came off as some sort of self-indulgent cathartic way for him to spend a summer in New York while making a relatively safe short-term investment off the heels of Twilight.Gets a C minus. Would have been solid D if not for the awesome ending and good supporting performances.",Remember Me
128,barbie-pombo,Respectable film...but could've been much better,7,21 April 2011,"First of all, i want to leave very clear the fact that this is indeed a must see movie...the thing is i'm not sure if it's necessary to watch it more than once. STILL! I could never say this is the kind of ""i wouldn't watch it twice"" type of film, cause every now and then i caught it on TV and it's impossible for me to switch channels. OK, so let's begin then. I'll try not to spoil much anyway.Ally (played by a not very moving Emilie De Ravin) goes through a very traumatic moment when her mother is murdered before her very eyes, living her alone with father (then again, a not very original performance by Chris Cooper)Neil Craig, a tough police Sargent. On the other hand, we have Tyler Hawkins (a very disappointing Robert Pattinson, for most of the movie) another troubled young man, who still suffers from his beloved brother Michael's suicide when being his age. Tyler also has a little sister, Caroline (the child star revelation of the movie, Ruby Jerins) who has a terrible time at school with classmates and has a great early talent for art. Then we have their father, Charles (played by an okay Pierce Brosnan) a lawyer who doesn't pay much attention to his kids, and has a terrible relationship with Tyler. Tyler and Caroline's mom, Diane and Charles are divorced, and she's already re-married to this guy, Les. Also, in Tyler's life there's his best friend and roommate, Aidan(another less than significant performance by Tate Ellington).Under this circumstances, and after a tense situation between Tyler and Sgt. Neil, Aidan finds out that the police cop's daughter goes to the same college they do, so he persuades Tyler to ask her out.That's when the ""unexpected"" happens. They fall in love. And as Romeo and Juliet, they have to fight for it. Now may i say just one thing? I wanna clear up the hole ""Robert Pattinson's disappointing performance"" before fans start cursing me. I consider myself quite an R-Pattz fan, but there are times when you think his either playing himself, or just some sort of mortal Edward Cullen spin off. His faces are LITERALLY underwear Vogue model at some frames. And i would know! I'm an acting student as well. Of course that's not all the time. There are scenes where he brings up a lot to his performance; there's this two favorite scenes of mine in the film: the fight at his father's office when he takes the drawing her sister made for him, and the moment when he goes pick her up to school and they're just walking home and talking. It's so simple, but it works! (They didn't have to try so hard to make every single scene be soo tragic and dramatic, sometimes less is more).The end of the film it's pretty nerve racking. Whoever's watching it can either love it or hate it, but i can make you sure, it is very unlikely for you to not feel a very intense catharsis towards it. To sum up: Robert is not all bad, Ruby is almost flawless, and the rest of the cast are not so ""rememberable"". But not a film you'll regret watching, or watching again.",Remember Me
129,john-2441,"Clichés, good bits, ridiculous end",2,11 August 2010,"This is yet another potentially great human drama slaughtered by trying to appeal to so many people it ends up losing any bite. The story is about relationships and how the results of our actions can reverberate in ways that are profound but unpredictable.It uses some quite dramatic violence early in the plot seemingly in order to charge the emotional conflict later - as the plot unfolds you just end up wondering why they bothered - if they had chopped the first and final 5 minutes it would have stood on its own – probably even more plausibly.A talented (of course) almost estranged son of wealthy business man dates the feisty daughter of solo parent ex-cop for revenge but falls in love. Throw in some parallel interpersonal family incidents, a very dramatic introduction and utterly unforeseeable even more dramatic ending to give it the guise of 'mystique' and there you have it.At times good acting and screenplay hampered by clichéd plot and at least one unbelievable casting mistake. Pierce Brosnan looks totally out of place, his accent drifts between Irish American & James Bond and he ends up (in part due to the story) looking more caricature than character.The typical American 'wonderment with riches' is ever present - the rebellion is little more than tugging of the forelock at the idea that people might actually be more interesting than wealth & privelidge.",Remember Me

The casting was completely spot on, not one actor looked out of place in their role. Robert Pattinson was stand out in this role and proves that he will be around for a long time to come. The chemistry between the entire cast is superb and is what helps make this movie so moving. I found myself getting very caught up in the stories and caring so much about the characters.

133,ShannonCharmedone,The most amazing film I've ever seen.,10,6 April 2010,"When I first saw the trailer for Remember me, I thought ""Just another story of guy and girl who shouldn't but do fall in love. Same old, same old"" But, I wanted to see it, because I am a massive, massive twilight fan, and the biggest Robert Pattinson fan of all time. When the film started up, about five minutes into it, I realised I never expected it, what I actually saw. Rob's portrayel of Tyler was like nothing I'd ever seen, I felt like after ten minutes, I already knew Tyler. I did dislike the fact that everyone hated him at some point. He somehow reminds me of myself, except, older, more beautiful, and a different gender. He always said something he shouldn't have, but he wasn't afraid to say it. The Tyler/ Caroline relationship I thought was pretty good, I can also relate to that, in a way that I am very close to my brother, so the relationship between the two didn't take me as much by shock as it did to everyone else. Aidan was a very funny character, when he said ""I want to put something into you..."" to the teacher when he wasn't concentrating on his words, I was laughing more than anyone else in the cinema, perhaps because most of them were so much older than myself. I think the casting in the film was superb! A lot of the people I've spoken to said to me that they didn't like the fact that Rob was swearing, drinking, smoking, and coming crimes. I think, it was a fun part to play for him, I honestly couldn't care less for the smoking, I know a lot of people who smoke. I have to say that when I heard from other people that it was sad, I honestly had no idea. The ending, was a major blow to me, I was gob smacked, I was crying harder than anyone else in the cinema, I generally feel more emotion than all of them. I was like, ""Oh my god! He's in the twin towers! 11th September 2001, 9/11!"" I was crying so hard, I had no idea. It just goes to show you, that anyone could've been in the twin towers that day.

134,robynnet,Just skip the first hour,8,16 June 2010,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, But I must say, I was slightly disappointed. Robert Pattinson (Twilight series) plays Tyler Hawkins, a woeful young man struggling with the death of his older brother and a father who he believes hates him. Tyler unexpectedly finds love with Ally Craig played by Emilie de Ravin (LOST) in the form of a revenge bet. Pattinson does play the brooding rebel quite well, and de Ravin does a nice job as a college student with troubles of her own, but the chemistry between the two is stiff at best. Now, I love it when a movie delves into character development, but for the first time ever, I think I found a movie that went too far. This movie just dragged on and on and on and on again. The plot was thoughtful and had oh so much potential, but sadly, this entire movie could have been much better as a 45 minute short film. No problem if you need a bathroom break. No need to pause if you want to make some popcorn or tuck the kids in.

'Remember me' was so close to realism. Though the first scene of the film showing Ally's mother being murdered was not necessary for the film - giving it a sort of crime scene movie - the rest was superb.This film falls under the genre of Drama, Romance, but I feel it has something more than that.All the leading character acting was very good. Though in reality a vibrant girl as Ally would not fall for a 'sleepy looking' guy as Tyler, their chemistry and acting was good. The emotions Tyler emits when angry, happy, and sad are realistic.The film depicts a story which can happen to anybody. That is why it is so realistic unlike some films you see.To tell you the truth, I did not understand the ending at first and thought 'what is this?, Did Tyler commit suicide by jumping? Why? Then after some reading only found out the real ending which made me shed tears. I played the video several times to the point where the teacher writes the date of disaster on blackboard and watched it again and again, and each time it was so emotional.

142,Dogwhiz,Surprisingly compelling and impacting,7,15 August 2010,"Remember Me is not a unique romantic drama. Nor is it a special romantic drama. In fact, it's really not a romantic drama at all. It is the story of the lives of two 21-year old New Yorkers who are still dealing with their grief over deceased family members. One is Tyler Hawkins (Pattinson), a lost and rebellious bookstore employee who blames his dad for his older brother's suicide and is ""undecided about everything"". The other is Ally Craig (de Ravin), a college student who witnessed her mother's murder at a young age and now lives with her overprotective cop father (Cooper), living her life to the fullest and eating dessert before her entree at every dinner in order to make sure that if she were ever to meet an untimely death during her meal, she would at least have made it to one final indulgence.The film focuses primarily on Tyler, observing the many problems he must endure, ranging from coping with the inescapable memory of the loss of his brother; an 11-year old art-prodigy sister (Ruby Jerins) who is unfairly teased and tormented by her classmates; and a cold, distant father (Brosnan) who ignores him and his sister both to the troublemaking antics of his roommate, Aidan (Tate Ellington), and a broken deadbolt.After his inability to keep his mouth shut lands him and roommate Aidan in jail for a night- courtesy of none other than Ally's father himself, Tyler makes a deal with Aidan to sleep with Ally and then subsequently leave her to get revenge on her father. Of course, this devious and mean-spirited ploy sets into motion a relationship that transcends all of Tyler's childish intentions, but at the same time, brings even more troubles into his life.As I mentioned before, despite misleading trailers and marketing campaigns, this film is not primarily a romantic drama. While it's certainly difficult to convince one of this notion with words alone (and given what seems to be a very romantic drama-ish plot), it's an important reminder to remember when seeing the film. Many- both common moviegoers and critics- have cited their disappointment with the movie's ending because it supposedly strayed from the film's romantic tendencies. However, the ending reveals the movie's true essence and conveys its intended message. In an effort to keep the review spoiler-free, I will refrain from elaborating on the ending any more, because- while I won't guarantee that your viewing experience will be undermined by knowing the nature of the ending ahead of time- it is certainly crucial to the intended impact of the film that you don't know about it beforehand. I'll get to more on my thoughts about the ending later, for those of you who have seen the movie already.In other departments, the film hardly ever excels above and beyond a simply decent production, however, certain aspects absolutely exceeded my expectations. Robert Pattinson's acting didn't blow me away, but managed to reconcile him from my list of actors who don't deserve to be in the industry at all (if you're wondering who's still stranded on that unforgivable list Zac Efron, Gerard Butler, Jessica Alba, Megan Fox, and Keanu Reeves are just a few of the top candidates I would vote out of the Hollywood tribe). I'm not about to jump the bandwagon of spellbound tweenage girls and run out to buy an Edward Cullen poster to plaster on my wall, but I will say that I was impressed with his abilities here. It's true that he's one of the best at brooding and sulking and even if that's all he's great at, at least it's something. Emilie de Ravin isn't quite as exceptional, but still puts in a strong performance. In the grand scheme of things, Chris Cooper and young rising star Ruby Jerins were the standout performers in my opinion as the loving but conflicted father and the misunderstood, too-mature-for-her-age sister. Pierce Brosnan, too, is exceptional in a way that makes you incapable of resisting your inner urge to hate his character and then find yourself sympathizing with him just a little bit, even if you don't want to.Some interactions breed a tad too much melodrama, the writing is far from flawless, and the dialogue is not without the occasional line that borders the edge of too-cutesy-to-hold-back-the-laughter, but these are all things you have to expect (not necessarily forgive) in a film that deals heavily with the relationship of two 21-year olds. For first time writer Will Fetters (who wrote the script several years ago when he was only 22) and small-time-experience director Allen Coulter, the execution and production value of the film are enough to engage you for its full 113 minute runtime and feel satisfied with the time you spent. But if there's any one element that sets it a step ahead of most other films of a similar nature (other than the ending), it's probably the film's ability to feel genuine on many of its several layers. More than anything, the relationship between Tyler and his sister is admirably real and the chemistry between the two actors is particularly apparent. And on a greater scale, almost the entire cast give performances that feel collectively authentic, which is perhaps what allows the movie to create the meaningful effect that it does and leave you stunned by the ending.In the end, the product that Coulter, Fetters, and their noteworthy cast accomplish is a well-constructed and– dare I say– captivating story of the lives of seemingly real New York individuals and the ways they deal with their unfortunate hardships and interactions, without pretending to give us the answers to our own problems or ostentatiously displaying to the audience how relationships are supposed to work. It's flawed, but its strong points outweigh the weak ones, giving it the weight it requires to make an impact.",Remember Me

But once I was in the theater, I was really drawn into the storyline and conflicts between Tyler and Ally and their dysfunctional families. The actors really brought something to each of their characters and really made me feel as if I was experiencing the same things as they were. The love between Tyler and Ally seemed genuine and you could really sense the deep feelings they had for each other. The ending was tastefully written, which I could not imagine was easy dealing with the subject matter. Overall, this movie was touching, shocking and amazing. I would definitely see it again!

I did not expect much of this title, but i get out of the movie theater surprised. Robert Patterson performance were very good, with this movie he demonstrate that he is a very good actor, sadly he is famous for his bad performance in the twilight movies if he do more movies like Remember me he can recover for that image. I think that RUBY JERINS(PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NAME) performance was fantastic, this little girl born in 1998 acts like an a experienced. I truly consider that she have to be at least nominated for an Oscar, i am not sure that she deserve to win but can be the starting point to a wonderful career. She was like Meryl Streep trap in a little girl body. Watching her were like watch Dakota Fanning in Man on fire. The story have a lot of situations that i thought were relevant, but at the end i think the director show them only for distraction of the story's core. The ending surprised me a lot, no one in the movie theater can tell that they saw that coming. Definitely a story and an ending to ""REMEMBER IT""",Remember Me

I'm also the type of guy that doesn't really like Twilight either, the film series Robert Pattinson is most commonly associated with. I'll be honest, the only reason I actually decided to watch this was because of how cute Emilie De Ravin is.I never expected how much the story would move me. This was largely because Pattinson really gave, for the want of a better that's not taken from the poster, gut-wrenching performance. The chemistry between him and De Ravin was amazing and much more genuine than any of the trash seen in the Twilight films. I don't really want to say much else, but to just go see the film.

151,Pretty_houstongirl77,Wonderful storytelling with an unexpected ending that hits you where you live!,10,28 June 2021,"We follow Tyler and Aly as they navigate a new and tender romance, each of them carrying their own scars and learning to live with them as well as the realistic portraits of the messy and sometimes toxic dynamics within each of their families independently.Tyler is mourning his brother's suicide and trying to reconcile the conflicting role of father figure and protectorate rather than big brother to his younger sister Caroline as their emotionally devoid father (Brosnin) immerses himself in his corporate empire to the exclusion of all else.Meanwhile their mother and stepfather attempt to bridge the gap and unintentionally push Tyler into the middle as go between to attempt to get his father's attention and force him to emotionally engage with his young daughter - a G&T artistic prodigy who already feels very isolated and socially awkward with her peers as many gifted children do.It's a role that Pattinson executes flawlessly, alternating between an outwardly appearing nihilist, but inwardly heartbreaking and furious empath who nurtures his sister without ever patronizing her and rages at his father who, like many of his kind, believes that providing a lavish and privileged life is an adequate substitute for genuine interaction and affection for his children.Aly is living an alternately sheltered/smothered existence following her mother's murder that she was witness to ten years prior as her NYPD Detective father is at once hovering (won't let her go to school by herself) and also absentee as he is content to have her stand in her mother's absence looking after their home and nursing her father's daily hangover after the previous night's drinking, his coping strategy in the wake of his wife's death.She approaches this situation with equal parts pragmatism and oddly cheerful pessimism. She'll eat desert first because she's learned very young that life is unpredictably fleeting and thus will not deprive herself her heart's desire in the spirit of living each day to the fullest while giving death the finger.The scripting manages to avoid being totally maudlin with well placed and non-formulaic comedic moments peppered throughout, but we see these characters as three dimensional people that you genuinely come to care about.What's most brilliant about this film is its shock ending. As we reach the closing of the story, we have already been on an emotional journey, living the failures, traumas and triumphs of the characters to this point. And while it starts to feel like things are finally going to possibly make some positive progress within each family dynamic as unspoken truces, forgiveness and true moments of growth are realized and effort on everyone's part is shown, you have this sense of foreboding that it's going to be too little too late.What no one is prepared for is that fateful morning, as young Caroline's teacher writes the date on the blackboard: Tuesday, September 11, 2001.And suddenly we're hurled back to that moment when the world learned together the horrors of that day. Nothing will ever be the same - and it hasn't been since.The survivors in each family as they witness the unthinkable in real time, the dawning of horrible realization, fear, and grief are palpable and we re-live each of those moments with them.The performances turned in by the entire cast are outstanding and give this film depth and heart - even when the characters seem heartless!

152,ThisGuyLovesMovies,His brooding level is over 9000!!!!,2,6 July 2012,"I don't hate Robert Pattinson, I think he can be a good actor it's just that he keeps getting such terrible scripts to work with. And this movie is one of them.Pattinson is a young ""troubled"" man in New York City who has to play surrogate dad since his father played by Pierce Brosnan is negligent towards her. He meets a young girl played by Emily DuRaven, who is the daughter of a cop played by Chris Cooper. The SAME cop that just so HAPPENED to beat him and arrest him one night. And they go for it and they fall for each other, surprise surprise.Robert Pattinson, does nothing but brood and whine and complain throughout the whole damn movie. He just basically says ""My brother is dead! My brother is dead!"". And his presence is just a drag and a bore for the movie. He doesn't translate well into drama if all i'm getting is him being a more whiny version of Edward Cullen. Chris Cooper is one of the better actors of it, but his performance is just kind of weird. He's playing a 22 year NY cop, but he didn't sound like he was from New York at all. And every time he is with Tyler (robert Patterson), there's always the sense that he would senselessly beat him to death because......just because. Because this movie is about daddy issues. And we can have one daddy where we see there's a human being underneath but not with both. For some reason it's just too much to ask.Speaking of daddies; Pierce Brosnan plays his father, a man who is all business and nothing else, not caring about the people he hurts even his family. You know I have never disliked a character played by Pierce Brosnan. But I do sort of have a problem with the Disney Dad, the dad that just apposes the main character JUST BECAUSE. And eventually, you start to relate more with Pierce, because you are so tired of Robert Pattison's whining and he rightfully berates him about it and in the middle of a business meeting no less. So this is the Disney Dad that tells him a speech similar to ""No I don't spend too much time at the office. You spend too much time whining about everything. And I am sick of it. Shut up son of mine!"" I almost applauded that scene it was so satisfying.Overall it's just okay. At the very least i could say its forgettable at the very worst.......right up until the ending. This is when they try to get a cheap emotional rise out of the audience, THE CHEAPEST EVER! I would not of been that bad though, the problem is that they set it up as a twist. And as the credits roll I just went "">groan< I hate this movie. So hard"" One of the WORST endings ever put to screen. M. Night Shyamalan you are forgiven. I could have forgiven this movie.....but after that ending? NO! This movie was terrible! That just really made me mad. I just thought ""How dare they!"" It was just awful. Its pandering on the absolute lowest level and ended on the cheapest emotional tug you could possibly do.",Remember Me

In fact, I stumbled across it on Netflix accidentally so just decided to have it on as a background watch. So, what made me leave it on? Let's just highlight it defo wasn't because of Robert Pattinson. (I've seen twilight and I wasn't impressed), I just wanted to see what the big fuss was about over him - and I can confirm to everyone that it defo wasn't his acting. Let me name a few good things about the movie first 1. The little girl was cute and played her character well. ....ok let me name the bad things 1.tyler played by pattinson. He over ""acted"" (and why the hell does he always play weirdos in movies? Bit weird..) his acting and character overall just made me cringe. Surely we as the audience are meant to feel sorry for him or think highly of him? awkward. I just found him annoying.2. Piers Brosnan. Sorry what accent were they going for? British? New York? Irish? As soon as I heard him speak I knew the movie wasn't going to be good.3. The annoying ""roomie"" . I think he was supposed to come across as ""funny"" or ""crazy"" when in reality ... ""Ugh""4. """"Romantic film? Oh no it's one of those family dramas. Oh wait rom-com. Oh another depressing moment. HUH?"" so as you can tell it was all over the place. Director defo wanted to please too many people (come on I done ALEVEL media we all know it's mainly one specific genre!) 5. OK. So because most of the film was a shambles let's just put something emotional in at the end! ---> not only did this not have ANYTHING to do with the film, it wasn't even needed!!! Why would you add something so serious into a pathetic tweeny romantic film?So to sum it all up, acting - very bad - script - basic - synopsis - ridiculous. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!

I had watched Robert Pattinson in the Twilight series but knew his acting potential wasn't unleashed. To state that Pattison dominated the movie would be an understatement. Each scene he was in, he towered over his cast members. Two scenes that definitely stand out, are 1) Verbal confrontation with his father, after which he did not show up to his daughter's art exhibition. 2) Takes action when his sister's classmates make fun of her.The movie overall was very well directed, with great acting from the cast especially the Pattinson's father and sister in the movie. Emotional scenes were well done especially between Pattinson and his sister. You could literally feel as if that bond between them was real. The only negatives is that I had wished for a stronger and more dramatic ending even had it been cliché. Also the romantic track between the lead pair did not get enough scope.

Then, the husband of the victim shows up, he's a NYC detective, so my thought was like ""maybe this is somekind of revenge, maybe he's a crooked cop into organized crime"". That's not the case though, this murder could have been used much better in the story to portray Ally as as troubled person just like Tyler.I am not an American, so the ending is simply absurd to me.

159,thestrawspinner,Perhaps i f Tyler had been black...,7,14 March 2010,"You'll have to forgive me if I seem a little perplexed as to why critics found this movie so hard to swallow. After going to see it myself, with no prior knowledge of its content, I came out quite impressed by the actors and genuinely moved (though not to tears) by the storyline. It was not necessarily something that would make my weekend brighter, obviously, but it was thought-provoking and discussion worthy (if only to argue about what was/was not incendiary about the plot). As a matter of fact, I do have to say, that the only thing that I really found unbelievable and insulting about this movie, was the critic's treatment of it. I mean, I do understand that people have different opinions and I truly try to respect that; but to criticize this movie as being too melodramatic, with too many issues that ""tries to borrow profound meaning""; and is (my favorite) a ""shameless contraption of ridiculously sad things befalling attractive people"", is a little more than ridiculous itself. Seriously, would it have been better if Tyler had been a large black high school kid from the ghetto, who made bad grades and had no place to live and was adopted by a rich white family? No, wait a minute, that was ""The Blind Side"". It's been done already; with much success and an Academy Award for Sandra Bullock I might add. Hmmmm...wait. I know. I know. How about if Tyler were an overweight, illiterate black high school student who was abused by her mother, raped and impregnated by her father (twice), and had HIV. Oops. No. Wrong again. That was already done in ""Precious"", which received critical acclaim for it's unrelenting horrors and an Oscar for Monique to boot. Look, don't let the critics fool you; black people and pain/suffering don't necessarily = an inspirational, feel good movie; and white people and pain/suffering don't necessarily = unbelievable melodrama unworthy of your time. Suffering is suffering, and there are many forms of it. This has nothing to do with attractiveness (or the lack thereof), money, or trivial concerns. It's about what we do with the moments of our lives each day, every day. See for yourselves. Whether you like it or not, you'll definitely have something to talk about in the end.",Remember Me

The generally cold hues made it more atmospheric and helped me get in the mood. The chemistry between the two main characters was also very good and Pattinson and De Ravin played their parts well. I was actually impressed with their performances, having only seen them in the past in their most popular titles.I did expect the classic twist in the story when De Ravin finds out the truth behind Pattinson's actions (I think everyone saw that coming) but I must admit I didn't see the end coming. The music was, to me, the best part of this movie. In the end it kept me restless, I knew something was wrong; you can feel it but you don't know what to expect. And throughout the movie it blended with the story exceptionally. My opinion is that a movie without music is nothing. It's one of the reasons why they had music played in theaters when movies didn't have any sound yet. So at the same time a movie with great music, that fits perfectly each situation, instantly can come closer to a making it a masterpiece even if it is mediocre in all other aspects.I'm giving this movie a 9/10 and not a 10/10 only because I expected that twist and I would love it if it was completely unexpected.",Remember Me

I loved that none of the characters felt like outcasts. They all have a very specific role and did them very well. The little sister, Caroline made me laugh, cry, smile, and giggle all at the same time. She is an up and coming actress. She reminds me of Dakota Fanning when she was starting in the business. It was superb to say the least. All the characters fit beautifully together. I saw the move 3 times and all 3 times I cried, clapped, chanted. and recited the lines I memorized from the time before. This was Robert Pattinson and Emilie's BEST performance yet. I think they worked very well together. They made me believe in Tyler and Ally not Robert and Emilie.

I promise that I am still normal enough to be unbiased.This movie was by far much better than the critics have rated it. It is by no means an Oscar worthy movie but it's a very compelling and deeply emotional story that tears at your heart and takes you on a wild emotional roller coaster. Rob Pattinson is surprisingly a good actor (I'm a fan but still admit the acting in the Twilight films is painful at best). His American accent needs some work and I will look forward to seeing him in a role when he isn't brooding - but I still think he did very well portraying his heavy-loaded character. The chemistry between he and Emile is believable and even the substantial amount of family dysfunction was relateable on most levels. The ending was a bit of a surprise (and not sure it was necessary to the story) but after I thought about it more, I decided it really only adds to the overall message - our life on earth is short and love like there is no tomorrow. I walked away wiping away my tears but feeling more appreciative of my life and I couldn't wait to go home and kiss my sleeping son. For those possibly offended by the ending, I believe the ending was tastefully done (if such a thing is possible given the circumstances). There was no glorification or sensationalism -just an added piece of the message to remind us of how life can be. So many people have a certain life one minute and the next - it's completely altered. This ending was, in a small way, a much needed reminder to cherish each moment we have.Everyone is different so maybe the level of tragedy in this story is too much for some.

Fine, I know it's not the kind of movie where I should be expecting a lot of action, but here I'm just asking for things to get going instead of making me feel the ever present inertia of the story.The acting wasn't transcendent, but it was okay. I guess the reason I didn't like this movie is because there was not a single character that didn't annoy me or seem believable. Aidan is an awful friend, self-centred, insensitive (like you've been mourning your brother for two weeks like dude you got to move on get out and get girls) and a bit of an idiot –in a kind way. Tyler is kind of full of himself at times (most of the time), he's obviously a good guy but nope can't feel his pain or his turmoil even though Pattinson is trying really hard. Ally's father is a psycho – you have to have a bad guy to balance the good one – who is overly protective (in my opinion a guy like him shouldn't be wearing a badge, much less a firearm). Tyler's father is an arsehole – need one of those too – who eventually shows humanity from time to time. And Ally she's kind of plain. The only character to find grace in my eyes is Caroline who was genuine.The plot is flat and predictable – no surprise there, but the passion they're trying to sell doesn't burn it's a pile of cold ashes from the beginning and stays that way the whole way through. As a result the end doesn't stir any kind of emotion either.It could have worked, or maybe it does and I'm just a stone-hearted person. I'll rephrase then, it just didn't work for me.",Remember Me

Not only does the Director attain a place among my favourites, so does Robert Pattinson among my favourite actors (although his acting in Twilight leaves much to be desired, his acting in this Movie is simply superb and one of the best performances I've ever seen from any actor/actress) and the Movie is definitely one of the most powerful I've seen. Everything fits together perfectly in this Movie, and it must be seen as a whole in order for any part of it to be truly admired. Every character feels so real that you are inevitably drawn into their world to the extent that you feel their worries, their sadness, their happiness, their strife. Everyone has something that they can take away from this Movie, and I truly mean everyone.Nothing can prepare you for the ending of this Movie. Even if like me you think you have everything figured out, you don't. I would describe ''Remember Me'' as truly original in script and dialogue and feels very true to life in it's uncertainty. The Movie is described as a Romantic drama. Romance between two people? yes there is that in the movie. The Romance of life however? If such a thing exists, truly fills up the entire two hours.You will be left at the end of the movie with a feeling that you will find hard to shake for hours.",Remember Me

From the very start to end, it was depressive, and so slow I wanted to turn it off many times. My friend recommended this movie to me (but we obviously don't share the same taste in movies, she likes the pointless ""Twilight"" where the acting is just as bad as this terrible movie). She did mention this movie had a surprising ending which is true. But I hated the ending, it didn't go with anything during the whole movie!!! Robert Patterson is as dead as he is in his twilight movies, he doesn't really say anything which is frustrating to see. Too much drama, too much crap and the ending was the worst!!! I thought this was going to be like Charlie McCloud, at least they had a real actor there and the plot was a lot better. But this one is too much drama about a messed up family that obviously doesn't use communication very much. And the girl's dad was way too tough, as a police man. Doesn't make much sense and not believable the way he was with her and everyone else. It also makes me dislike New York, from the very start to till the very end. Why do people live there anyway???

I never expected him to be able to act such a magnificent role! just great!the little kid was great too..About the story, it was well thought, had really good pace, was warm, and really comfortable to watch! I dunno how to describe it but I'm really moved by the story! didn't expect it to be this amazing! Also, the reference to 9/11 , well, I'm an Iranian, means 9/11 hasn't really been explained to me as it should be, all I knew about it was some political stuff, now this movie for the first time made me ""feel"" what it must have been like, for people of a country, to go through such tragedy!And, I really don't categorize this movie as the sad-ending or dark ones, coz it really wasn't... the ending was actually quite nice and happy and in peace! the fact that everything fell back into place before Tyler died? it was great! thats why I say the screenplay was well-though and well-written!The whole movie made you comfortable, nothing bitter!So, Bravo to the director, the writer, the actors and actresses, and whoever made or chose the soundtrack!Really great drama, with fair amount of fun, wittiness, fantasy, reality and tragedy!

Very misguided and thoughtless actions almost result in another loss to him of a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love.The character's angst is beautifully portrayed by Robert Pattinson in the role of Tyler Hawkins and his range of emotion, from bored ennui to consuming rage against a distant father, to a finally realized reconsideration of his thoughts about his life, is poignant and thoughtful.As everything appears to fall into place, circumstances completely outside of his control leave a last bitter tragedy in his young life.",Remember Me

After watching this film I've made up my mind as to the following conclusion: he certainly can pull off a leading dramatic performance. 'Remember me' is not a spectacular movie that will join the classic movies club, yet I wasn't bored for a moment while watching it. Solid performances by rest of the cast, including Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan results in pretty decent movie which I can recommend to all the people who think Pattinson can't act. Unless they are prejudiced for good, I think they can be really surprised (in a good way). Still, it doesn't make me want to watch twilight series, but I won't hesitate checking out his other dramatic roles.",Remember Me

181,nathanielshouse,overlooked films,8,15 November 2014,"It's a love story and a tribute to the people of New York City during a specific time period. I don't like to give stories away, though this movie is four years old so I'm sure most everyone has already decided if they wanted to see it or not. I'm writing this for those who didn't even pay attention to its release, me being one of those; I just saw it last week through Netflix. Consider this if you want to see a movie that compared to many current movies is difficult to make, not literally, I mean difficult to make in that it's surprising that it's made at all. There's no ""orange"" in it, you know what I mean, the big bright screen, with explosions and noise, people killing each other, etc. And by the way I'm not against those when I feel they're well done, but if you're in the mood for a love story, here's one that thoughtfully, artfully, accurately, takes you to another time.Themes include first real love between two young adults, unspoken family problems, feelings of isolation, and an appreciation of your self and your time. Not a fairy tale type romance movie. There's no assumption on their relationship and how it's going to be.I like Remember Me. I don't believe in art for art's sake, i.e., in movie terms, movies just for entertainment. I'm sure I've made exceptions but I need more than ""just to escape"" although that's important, I know, but I think that should be included. I go into most films, including documentaries, with a hope that at least some if not all involved in the film project have something to say. Remember Me does.I don't remember this movie's original release, but Remember Me may be something I avoided because Robert Pattinson did all the Twilight movies so I didn't want to notice him doing anything else. I'm not a big fan of the Twilight movies, plus I didn't really like his character in those movies. I don't really want to explain myself, but I kind of had to sit through them all. I probably would not have seen any of them after the first one if given a choice.

184,TheMagister,A very well done piece of storytelling.,8,23 June 2010,"I went into this blind, not knowing the storyline or characters. I'd recommend that to film viewers in general, but it's especially important in Remember Me.I confess to being jaded against Robert Pattinson, figuring anything other than ""Lost Self-hating Vampire Teen"" would be beyond his capabilities as an actor. Thankfully, he can pull off this current gig with surprising emotion and insight into his character. True, this role has much in common with his previous success, but the tone and flavor is so totally different that it really ceases to be a parallel -- you really forget that ... other movie.Chris Cooper is his usual fantastic self -- he nails his role with a sledgehammer. Mr. Cooper, if you ever read this, take pride in your abilities as they are. You may *be* a character actor, but there's nothing wrong with doing what your good at when what you're good at involves virtuosity. Awesome. Just awesome.The story proceeds with interesting character introduction and interaction, and, almost imperceptibly, the story leads you into their lives until you find yourself caring about their situations and decisions. So few directors are able to pull this off, and *very* few are able to do it without you (as a viewer) feeling bludgeoned into it. In many scenes, there is an almost unconscious ""fly on the wall"" feel where you forget that this is all contrived; that someone wrote a script and there is a camera very purposefully placed so that things'll be pretty and you'll buy a ticket and makes some people some money. I'm talking about ""suspension of disbelief"", something that this director, Allen Coulter, accomplishes masterfully.A wonderfully shot, wonderfully imagined film. I didn't ""get it"" until exactly when I was supposed to, and that was a fantastic thing to experience again. Only a few films have done that to me. This is one of 'em.",Remember Me

190,Meowkit,A truly beautiful film.,9,18 August 2010,"I will admit—I had my doubts about this movie because of the series of movies that Robert Pattinson acts in. I do not like the Twilight movies—not because of what they are about, but because they are genuinely poorly made.Remember Me, however, was not.Throughout the whole movie, I was raptly attentive—Pattinson's character drawing me in by his development and the internal monologues he gave. I was truly touched by his ""life lessons"" and the interactions between him and the other wonderfully developed characters. Because the characters were so believable and well-crafted, it was no wonder that I soon became attached to every single one of them.Which is why I cried profusely at the movie's end. It wasn't just Pattinson's character's death that saddened me, but the reactions of the other characters that I cared so much for that also brought me to tears. 9/11 is already a depressing and heart-wrenching subject, as is a death of a character that one greatly likes—thus, this combination at the end of the movie—especially when it seemed as though things were ""looking up""—makes Remember Me's ending scene one of the saddest I have ever come across. The only other ending scenes that I have cried at as hard as I did for this one are Titanic, the Green Mile, and Seven Pounds.Despite its ending—actually, /because/ of its ending and other parts and elements of the movie—I am confident when I say that Remember Me is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates touching, dramatic movies (with lighthearted areas thrown in).",Remember Me

However if they watch the film only the most dramatic of cynics will keep up this pretense. The films story and acting captured me and personally I really enjoyed it. The film deals with the classical responses and phases of mourning, such as anger, guilt bargaining and denial, eventually leading to acceptance. These big issues combined with a convincing love story, classical 90's divorce and elements of teenage angst captured my full attention for the duration.The films twist was OK but some what not needed. It gave a cool indie looking flick a very Hollywood feel all of a sudden. The music through out the film does lead the viewer to sense a tragegy is on the horizon and is some what of a give away. The September 11 ending I hope was inspired by some element of a true case study because to use it to simply add a twist is some what cheap. However the film as a whole is enjoyable, relatable and has sections of high quality cinematography. Supporting actress De Ravin supplies a good performance I have not seen from her since ""Brick"" Some reviews on rotten tomatoes slate this film with no real evidence to reasons why?

Being a writer myself, I think that's a very interested choice to make for how to end your movie. Was it just tacked on, I wonder? Many people seemed to think so--that the whole point of Remember Me was to get people to remember September 11th, but handled in a very clumsy manner.Certainly I think that most of the negative reviews Remember Me received were exactly because of that ending. It felt tacked on. It didn't seem to have any real bearing on the rest of story, didn't flow naturally from the other elements. Possibly, it was just a way for the movie to jerk even more tears from its audience, an overly transparent and tasteless way; others actually liked it.But what I'm kind of wondering to myself is, ""Just how tacked on was that ending,"" really? Now, first of all, if this story was actually based on a true story, I could understand the ending. But I don't recall there being anything to indicate that, at all--no final scrawl saying this character went on to do this, this character went on to do that. So I'm pretty sure it was an arbitrary decision by the screenwriter.But what if the character had merely died in, say, a car crash? Would the ending still have been tacked on? No, I don't think so. If that had been the case, people might look at the movie a little differently: ""This character lost his brother to suicide a few years ago. Alyssa lost her mother ten years ago. Both families have been wrecked by these incidents. But now, somehow, after all these years . .. things have finally started to come together for them. Tyler and Alyssa have gotten together, and after some rocky times their lives are looking up. And Tyler's sister and his father have started to mend their relationship. Everything looks like it's about to start to be good for these characters--but no. The Greek gods, or fate, or destiny, has something else planned for them."" And instead of deus ex machina, it's more like diablo ex machina. I'm reminded of City of Angels, just when Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage seemed to have found their happy ending. I was always angry at that ending.I think that Remember Me may deserve a second look. Removing Tyler from the story through September 11th does seem tacked-on, a way to keep September 11th in our memories even more. One way or another, it does feel like a mistake.But I have to wonder, then--at risk of letting this review descend into even greater insignificance than it already has: just why would the writer decide to use September 11th? Was there something about the events of that date that made it that much more significant for the writer than it already is for the average American? Did the writer actually know someone that died in September 11th? Or someone that died around the same time as September 11th? I can't help but feeling there was an important story trying to be told in Remember Me, almost something like Prometheus or Icarus--of characters cursed by the gods, fate, or happenstance.And yet, in choosing to tie it all together with the seemingly very arbitrary choice of September 11th, it undermined the message. If someone did somehow consider September 11th integral to the story, to their own personal story perhaps, I would have liked to see more of THAT story. And if not--if the central purpose of the whole story was just to remind people of September 11th . . . then I'd say it failed badly, and if Remember Me is remembered, it will ultimately be for the fact that its ending had so little to do with the rest of the movie.",Remember Me
206,cupkate35,they've got balls,7,11 July 2010,"the movie was very slow, and the only reason this movie was worth watching all the way through was because of Robert pattinson, hes a good performer not to mention good looking and his narrative voice was fitting for the feel of this movie. the brooding feel was really well portrayed by pattinson and the lighting, however the movie tried to hard to make you sad. to end the movie they tried to make you feel devastated for these people by tying in a world tragedy. any death is one to be sympathetic about but they tried to hard. this was not the worst movie, or even a bad movie, just was not one of the best i've seen. if your in the mood to be put in limbo in order to force yourself to come up with an end resulting feeling then id try this movie out other wise, its not a good sunny day, girls night type movie.",Remember Me

But the lives the characters have had to live and the surprise ending were emotional and hard to watch. Throughout, I found myself laughing, smiling and crying. The acting, especially by Robert Pattinson, was spectacular and the characters were easy to relate to.

If you plan to see this movie, it's much better if you know nothing about it. Don't ask anyone. Just watch it. I think the way it was advertised made it look like another romantic drama. NO. Not at all. You stop thinking about who the actors are and get completely drawn in by the characters. Yes, there is romance, but there's so much more to it. I won't ruin the surprise though.

My friend of 9 years had never seen me cry so hard. Its definitely a must-see. The Twilight Saga does Robert Pattinson no justice. At first, I didn't really like him as an actor.

Well first I sorta cheated by checking on here and Wikepedia to see why it was rated what it was rated and i ended up reading the ending to the film when I first read that i thought people always lie on wiki so i didn't think much of it and so i bought the movie and was amazed the main actors were amazing the supporting characters were amazing you could actually believe that these characters were real people and dealt with grief, happiness,love,loss,and anger that is what makes the ending even more heartbreaking how they approached the ending i think was done both beautifully now with what the critics say i don't understand how many can say this movie was not good when i thought it was wonderful but hey "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder "" i guess is what applies here also i think the ending was well and for people like me who were young when the event happened found it as a great way to show that every person who died was not just a number but an actual person and I will admit i cried for a good half hour after the movie was over again i say beautiful movie and i highly recommend it",Remember Me

What a tremendous performance by Rob. I saw his acting potential in Twilight, he was by far the main reason those movies were even as good as they were. But he really seems to be strengthening his craft in this movie. He's believable and you can't take your eyes off him. Not because of handsomeness, but something magnetic.

215,efrosina_jivkova,"Kinda okay, did not like the love-story though ...",6,7 January 2012,"For me, this is a movie with so much potential, yet ruined by the poorly presented relationship between the two protagonists. I did not get any emotion out of the scenes with Tyler and Ally. I guess that the movie wanted to show a lot and therefore did not concentrate entirely on them, however I still believe that the so-called love had to be presented more passionately, not only through the 2 scenes when they were making out. Don't get me wrong, I am not a fan of the sugar-puffed Hollywood presentation of love, however I did not enjoy the somehow stiff and emotionless act of Pattinson and De Ravin. When it was not stiff, it was over-dramatized. The script contributed to the overall feeling of a love story, not being truly ... a love story. My opinion is that it either has to be there, and it has to be GOOD, or there shouldn't be one at all. I imagine the movie just like a pure drama, no romance, and I like the idea. Furthermore, I did not get the point of the whole Ally's-father-issue. Again, I understand what the directors probably meant, but they did go to nowhere with it. Why didn't he care about the happenings on the street, when this is exactly what killed his wife? Why was the moment with the disappointing of Ally so important? Just to make it more cliché or what? What did we actually learn for the father? What did he learn during the movie and how did his relationship with Tylor changed? Just throwing some drama-stuff at us is not going to work, movie! Another thing - what was so important about cutting the girl's hair? Okay, you may think I am an a*****e, but I have been through exactly the same period as a child, and guess what - my parents did not pay at all that much attention and I grew up as a secure person with perhaps even too much self esteem. Of course, there is the dead brother issue, but come on, this was so over-dramatic...Interesting final, even though I felt it a bit misplaced, but let's say I just did not expect it. Overall I kinda enjoyed the movie to certain point, decided to write about the negative parts of it though. Certainly not one of my favorites and for sure nothing that shouldn't be skipped. P.S. The description of the movie is wrong. Ally does not live to the fullest, at least I did not get any of this idea, except that she eats her dessert before the main course (which I find annoying, it is so much better to suffer a bit before receiving what u want ;) )",Remember Me
216,holdenelizabeth,A Reminder,7,10 May 2011,"just watched Remember Me for the first time tonight. Going in, I vaguely knew what to expect. I knew what the ending was about, but not who died or what the circumstances were. It was an emotional and powerful film, but a lot of people have criticized the ending as being extraneous and offensive . No one can answer that question, and as uncouth as this sounds - it is what it is, and it is a well made film. Anyway, I just assume a movie with a similar plot to this one was eventually going to be made (how could it not?), and that I'm grateful Remember Me was the first one to do it.II thought Remember Me brought more than just the controversial emotional ending to the table. All of the sub-plot were emotional evoking and show that it shouldn't just be huge tragedies that unite us, but that we all suffer the same from our personal losses. That the loss of one family member can be even more difficult than a huge tragedy because there are fewer people to empathize with you - or even care enough, to provide support or get over their reservations. It is probably just a personal experience, but Remember Me reminded me that I'm not the only one that's damaged or lost, but that most people in this world have suffered as much.",Remember Me
217,thinkingofrob,"Remember Me teaches us a powerful lesson, one we should all live by, but so often forget : ""Live in the Moment""",9,23 April 2011,"Remember Me is a brilliant screenplay written by Will Fetters. Many can oversee the underlying lessons of Remember Me and chalk it down to being a dramatic romance, however they will have failed to see the true meaning of Remember Me. Remember Me is a story about people like you and I. It's a story about grief, and how everyone deals with it differently. Robert Pattinson plays Tyler, the wounded college student who's fighting to come to terms with his brother's death. This is Rob's best performance yet. In Remember me he proves that he's so much more than Edward Cullen. Pierce Brosnan, plays Charles Hawkins, the father who buries himself in work to forget the death of his first son. Ruby Jerins shines in the role of the artistic, often misunderstood, youngest daughter of a family trying to cope with a tragedy that has befallen them. The Hawkins family truly represents how death can affect people in so many different ways and have a big impact on actions years down the line.Rebelling Tyler works in a bookstore, is a free student and lives with Aidan (Tate Ellington). Aidan is the much needed comical relief in Tyler's life. Behind his funny guy facade Aidan cares deeply for Tyler and tries in his own way to help Tyler get through this rough moment in his life.Boy meets girl, Tyler meets Ally who also has her own share of grief to deal with. Ally while coping with her own grief tries to deal with her father's grief. Neil Craig (Chris Cooper) is another perfect example of how people deal with grief differently. Tyler and Ally's relationship develops and their shared grief makes Tyler realize that he is not alone, bringing them closer together. The chemistry between Tyler and Ally is great.The entire cast of Remember Me did an amazing job in portraying the lives of these dysfunctional families. Tyler's relationship with his younger sister is so touching and sweet.The ending packs a powerful punch that will leave you reeling and speechless. Only then will you truly understand the meaning of Remember and what this movie has to teach you.Remember Me teaches us a powerful lesson, one we should all live by, but so often forget : ""Live in the Moment"".",Remember Me

Although I felt there were a few flaws (as they are in almost every movie) the movie was still very well made. you could really relate to the characters and somewhat the story which is what every movie needs in order to win over the audience. At least in my opinion, I would recommend this movie to ages 13 and over, or 15 and over. I truly believe that this movie is worth watching and you will enjoy especially if your into drama and romance (and if you like Robert Pattinson!) like I said the cast is very good, maybe not the best movie that you have ever seen but definitely one of the good ones.

Its not everyday that you see actors performing in such a way that you can really feel what the character must be feeling. The overall cast was amazing. You get to see a totally different Robert Pattinson in this movie. As for Emilie de Ravin, I can't really say much as this was her first movie that I saw, but she did portray her character very well.Story : 9.8/10 ..... The whole story is amazing. Some of us thought that there was a small thing left out unsolved, but according to me that even made it better. It teaches you that not everything in life always goes right. Although, in the start, you might think that it is just a normal love story flick(that is why I took away 0.2 points), but as the story further proceeds, you just start loving it. And trust me, you do not want to miss the end.Overall: 10/10 ..... It is just amazing. If you are getting tired of watching those regular action/comedy/romance flicks and do want to watch a movie that makes you feel all empathic, this is the one.It is a must see for everyone.

So I was actually surprised when I watched the movie and found myself getting emotionally invested in the characters. While I still found Pattinson to be like Edward from the Twilight movies, I found his acting as Tyler Hawkins more bearable and believable. The story line wasn't what I was expecting either. I was just anticipating some sappy over the top romance, but it wasn't. It's a story about life and death, the ups, the downs, the surprises along the way and the way we deal. Pierce Brosnan always does a good job (except for his singing in Mama Mia) and I found him to be a convincing parent who has no idea how to reach out and communicate or show love to his children. All the acting was acceptable but I want to officially say that Ruby Jerins is one of the best things about this film. She is gorgeous, vulnerable and hard to take your eyes off of. She plays Caroline Hawkins and is amazing. I wanted to cuddle her and scare the tar out of her school bullies too. The ending is a controversial one. I personally found it to be suitable for the movie but I can understand how a lot of people take issue with it. A lot of people think it is piggybacking on a national disaster but I can appreciate that the director was just trying to connect his audience with that horrible event. I think it made the story more emotional. I certainly got emotional when I realized what was going to happen. It just brought back the memory of 9/11 and I felt horribly depressed to imagine what all those poor people went through. So for me, although absolutely shocking and heartbreaking, I didn't hate the ending.I really recommend you watch this movie. It's a tad slow and it does leave you with a very melancholic feeling but it's not a shockingly bad movie.

If you are not a huge fan of Twilight / Pattinson, you might not be impressed of his acting: I found it really bad. Then there was the script: the story was not believable, I mean I don't think people in real life would react the way they did in some of the situations. I had the feeling that the writer wanted to get them in certain situations but didn't know how to do that in a natural way, so he exaggerated a lot: in character traits, in reactions, in lines. So instead of relating to them and their sad feelings, I was annoyed by them. I couldn't get their anger, I just felt they were stupid. I was left with absolutely nothing after watching an hour and 20 minutes of this movie - that being the moment I stopped watching. I wasn't even curious of how it ends or whatever happens to them, all I could think of was how I wasted a Friday evening.

Remember Me was advertised as that cliché young love story that we've all seen. In actuality its a movie about coping with death and loss. The story revolves around Tyler and Ally, a pair of young New Yorkers that have both witnessed the death of a loved one and are now are left with splintered families. The movie presents an original and captivating plot with a superb cast. Robert Pattinson wonderfully captures his character, a complex and driven young man, while the supporting actors were totally on par with his performance (I particularly enjoyed Chris Cooper's portrayal of struggling yet loving father).

However, the ending just felt rushed, and 9/11 did not really tie well into the themes that have been fleshed out throughout the film. I love plot twists but sadly, for me it just felt out of place with what was being explored.As a side note, I liked Pattinson's acting in this film. I think for some it's ""cringe"" but it's his character - an awkward, impulsive 22 year old dealing with grief & trying to survive without depending on his somewhat absent father.

The cast of the film (some well known and others not so) did an excellent job of portraying dysfunctional characters with real lives and real problems.The films tag line tells you everything you need to know.The love story was done just right as it showed a developing relationship rather than just jumping in with both feet.The scenes with Robert Pattinson and Ruby Jerins as Caroline his younger sister were the true depiction of what a real big brother/little sister relationship should be and they were precious.Please go see this film and learn from it...",Remember Me

OK, the story wasn't entirely new, but it was a good, honest story...funny, moving, not too pathetic...it felt real, and it was entertaining overall, and that's what a movie is supposed to be, right? As for the ending, I didn't find it offensive at all, but I'm from Continental Europe (hence the probably bad English), and maybe that's an American-thing? I liked ALL the actors, and really got into their stories, I felt for them....WELL DONE!! How sweet was the relationship between Tyler and his little sister?? OK, I'm a woman, and most of that scenes got me grinning all over, but my boyfriend liked the movie as well, and that rarely happened lately. Too many bad blockbusters I suppose, and that movie was something more real, which you don't get that often in cinemas these times... Go, watch it.",Remember Me

I heard from a friend it was good but overall the Twilight shadow lingers around Pattinson.The movie isn't technical, it doesn't try to be something it isn't. It tries to tell a story, a very potentially real story, and convey those emotions.Overall Pattinson puts on a great performance and all cast play their role well. While the movie could be more polished it works well.The movie is a solid 7, maybe 7.5 and worth a watch.The ending is alluded to through many ""Christopher Nolan""-like clues but still remains somewhat of a ""twist"".",Remember Me

He didn't let Bronson or Cooper eat him alive in scenes. the office scene between him and Bronson was beautifully acted by both. He scenes with Cooper were great as well, he pushed Cooper's character because he couldn't push his father. I cried even kinda knowing the ending. My favorite relationship in the film was Tyler/Caroline, that lil actress is so good and her and Robert were so great together. His relationship with Allie was my least favorite because it seemed forced, but it was also sweet at the same time. I thought Robert swallowed Emile up in scenes, maybe that was it.

238,Courtney-Daniellexo,No words can describe how amazing this movie is.,10,14 March 2010,"This review is coming from a 16 year old girl.. I went to see this opening night with my friend and my 20 year old sister. We got there an hour early to avoid the Twilight fan girls. (I myself am a fan of Twilight.. The books, the movies could have been better. But I don't fan girl over them and fictional vampires..) Surprisingly, my friend and I were the youngest people there. I have to say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was 7 when 9/11 happened, and I really think this movie helped me understand more of what happened that day, and what so many people went through that day, and are still going through. I don't know why so many people are hating on the ending. The whole point of the movie is to live in the moment, because unexpected tragedies can happen at any time. I live in a small town in Nova Scotia, and could never imagine anything like that happening where I live. But after seeing this movie, I realize everything can change in an instant for the best or worst. The acting and chemistry between the actors was absolutely amazing and believable. Especially between Robert and Ruby. That relationship was my favourite in the movie. It was nice to see Rob in a role that wasn't a vampire or a wizard. He really shined in this movie with his acting skills. Even haters will see him more as Edward when they see this movie. 10/10 for this movie. I would recommend it anyone. If you haven't seen it, go! It's worth the admission fee. Even Rob haters - go see it! You'll see him more of an actor after this movie. Just don't read things that spoil the movie. It's worth seeing without reading spoilers.",Remember Me
239,Bern0903,"Romantic, But Klennex Consuming & An Exceptionally Moving Film.",10,23 March 2020,"Hello and welcome to my review of a very special film of 2010 called ""Remember Me"".Firstly, if you have not seen the film then please come back to this review afterwards as it contains my take and review in some detail and I really, really, really do not want to spoil any part of it for you.
Hence the separators below.Yes, the more observant of you will note I am writing this in 2020.
This is at the heart of the Coronavirus outbreak in the UK, and like this film, the comparisons to not taking your daily life for granted are almost identical.
We are faced with a life threatening disease and like 9/11, the ripple effect, affects everyone around the world, which this tragic event almost nearly 20 years ago did. My greatest respect & condolences to all those affected on that day. 😢I will start and add I have a massive crush on Emilie De Ravin she is extraordinarily beautiful from her deep piercing greeny slate grey eyes to her loving and magnetising smile just reels you in. Yes, I like her a great deal and maybe in another life . . . . . . . Do dream on Bern lol . It was a nice daydream you know . . . . I told you in my Bio that I daydream a lot and this film covers that in some detail from Tyler being very Introvert in his feelings to Extrovert in his cheeky, mischievous, really not give a monkeys behaviour.
""It's a bowl not an ashtray"" . . . . ""It was just teasing me"" . . . . . lol 🤣To Caroline doodling her artwork staring into space and being asked by the teacher to zone back in from her dreamscapes. I went to secondary school with someone who had the same condition and everyone is unique and should allow for that some people are just different and accept them for who they are than try to change them with the modern popular conformities we are faced with each day.There were some scenes and elements in this film I really objected to:The first of these, was the lash out of Ally's father Sgt Neil Craig when he hit Ally to the floor that was excessive violence and with Domestic Abuse being rampant in this day and age around the world, Script writers need to reign in their ideas as they can be perceived as offensive. I know this is just a film and we should not take it so literally but where do people get the ideas to hit someone from? Films, Media, Dramas, Wars . . . . etc. Granted, I am having a tad of rant here, but bear with me please, as I am one the most soft-hearted and caring natured guys you may ever encounter. The feeling I had at that moment was you are abusing your power as Police Officer and a Father. Or maybe that is what the Script Writers wanted you to feel? I don't know . . . . I reacted badly to it and to the murder on the opening sequence. I know why they do this to wake you up with a jaw dropping sequence the late and greatly missed Director Tony Scott's Déjà Vu did this too.You literally felt your popcorn fall from your mouth into your lap with shock.😮The fact that if I had been there, I would have picked up Ally up wiped away her tears, snogged her and then smacked him one back but 2 wrongs hardly make a right now do they? And at the risk of sounding a hypocrite, I really do deeply care about people's feelings and how one's interactions affect them both mentally and physically. No truer said then in the next upsetting scene where Caroline has had her hair chopped out by her jealous and mean-spirited school peers. That was a little to close to the bone too. Bullies revel in this kind of mistreatment and it goes on too much and for it to be presented in the film for more senseless idiots to copy at their school was too much for me personally.Sorry . . . . I know you are probably thinking ""Bern, it's just a film"" but it is a thought provoking film on how we can improve others lives and not just our own selfish desires that we are all guilty of, myself included. This is the counterpoint now we have reached where no longer the negatives prevail the positives creep in and the characters start to slowly evolve and change into more civil human beings that really do care about each other despite their harsh attitudes towards each other.The film's ending made me think profoundly of, if that was me, what would I think or do? Hmmm deep huh? yeah it is . . . . and I am not too ashamed to admit tears were streaming down my face at this point as it was entwining reality with fiction and it got to me 💖 right here. I don't think many people could watch this film and still not cry it is such a powerful performance from a great bunch of actors & actresses.
So before you all fall asleep from my semi novel, I will wrap it up here.Just to say that I noticed at the end too, Emilie looks just off camera and that was poignant and powerful too as she was now full of hope and gratitude for life and love she now holds.Thank you so much for reading this and I hope you understand where I am coming from and that I mean no offence to anyone.",Remember Me

Good ride.,10,24 March 2010,"I hope everyone who hasn't seen the movie yet, will want to watch it after reading this review, because Remember Me sure deserves to be seen. And above all it deserves to touch as many hearts as possible. Yes, that's what Remember Me does: when you leave the theater you won't just go on to your next activity, the story and characters will be under your skin.Robert Pattinson (Tyler) really does a great job portraying a struggling young man. With diverse people in his life, in the movie, you get to see many sides of Tyler, you get to know him throughout the film. Yes, a romantic side, but that certainly isn't all of it. The movie is an emotional roller-coaster. Even more, the strong band called family, plays a leading role in Remember Me.Emilie de Ravin is also brilliant as Ally, you believe she IS Ally. But I have to say even more credit goes to the little girl playing Caroline, Ruby Jerins.Go see it and step into Tyler's world, learning some important lessons -again -. You won't regret it. And remember: love has many sides to it.",Remember Me
241,idilionotturno,"""When you remind me to remember me with this movie""",8,9 May 2020,"Remember Me is a romantic drama film directed by Allen Coulter, screenplay by Will Fetters and starring by the criticized actor Robert Pattinson, who had been forgotten after the twilight saga. Without a doubt it is a interesting film that has you quite entertained with the plot that it presents and that without any doubt brings a message to the viewers.
This film is set in the summer of 2001, and contains an important date for the history of New York, the twin towers attack. A variety of parks of NY and sceneries are shown that allow us to become even more involved in the history that is presented to us. The music was done by Marcelo Zarvos and the photography by Jonathan Freeman.
Remember Me is a nice film that tells us the life story of Tyler, an adult who plays the bad guy but is nevertheless surrounded by books and knowledge with which he usually seduces the girls and which therefore turns out to be not only a bad boy , but also a good match if not for his terrible addiction to cigarettes and alcohol. Tyler is in a not-so-pleasant state because of the death of his brother, his little sister is now his new protected and his life changes from one moment to the next thanks to the daughter of a cop who arrests him and seeks revenge with each other.
The film begins with a rather cruel and shocking prologue, a terrible event on the New York subway. A little girl has to witness her mother's murder after being assaulted. After 10 years Ally Craig (Emilie de Ravin) turned into a wonderful girl meets Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson) causing something more to emerge between them than a simple attraction that ends up being a dramatic past. Tyler, on the contrary, is more carefree and lives in hell since a tragic event marked his life forever. His whole life collapsed in that instant and his relationship with his father (Pierce Brosnan) was completely broken. The only cheerful and most important motive in his life is his little sister.
Although romance seems to be the main topic, the director has attached great importance to the subject of the family and the problems it may entail, as well as to the feelings of self-improvement and strength of people when they are led into borderline situations, creating a pretty interesting scale. I recommend this film because you can enjoy a exciting plot.",Remember Me
242,aeprovost,Reading the spoiler made me want to see this movie.,9,13 March 2010,"First of all, my husband and I are in our mid thirties. He was extremely skeptical about any movie with Rob Pattinson, assuming it would play to his fans (teenage girls). I had my doubts too and I rarely venture into PG-13 movies in the theater. That said, it was a review with spoiler on IMDb that convinced me to give this movie a try. If this movie fails to do well in theaters I believe it will be because the marketing department decided to keep the ending a secret.They made it out to be a romance about two people with father issues. This is a movie about two families who are both dealing with unthinkable losses just beginning to heal when a greater tragedy strikes. It was a beautiful and gentle reminder that 9-11 was about people. That it affected so many so deeply. It was done to just the right degree. At the moment I felt I couldn't stand to see what I knew was coming they cut away. They made it about the faces of the people who saw it happen in person. Whose lives were directly changed by it.The irony that a British guy is responsible for this film making it to theaters, while two American anti-Iraq War movies share the billboard, should not go unnoticed. Those who remember why we're fighting should support this movie. Those who were in New York may not be ready for it yet, but I believe it was tastefully done and timely. Their marketing team should have come out and said what it was about in the trailer though. It's not something we want to be surprised with. It brought me right to the edge of tears and I knew it was coming.I'm debating whether to buy it on DVD. When my kids are old enough (14/15) it may be good way to introduce them to the reality of the impact the events of 9-11 had on all of us.",Remember Me

But is movie shocked me, its simple, realistic and talking about something most of us have already lived and suffering form which is the lose of a close person. one of the things that i admired about that movie that finally they showed that its not always important that the lost one is a lover or a spouse, sometimes it could be a a family member or even a friend which will conduct all the despair and agony inside of u. the story is fantastic and the dialog was amazing loved it, loved the little girl she is so nice and such a potential on her. her face say everything she doesn't even has to talk. am not Robert fan for me he is a dead actor and i think anyone else would do that role much more better, the office scene when entered the meeting on his father and the way he was fighting and trying to have his breathe, was soooooooo lame, that it made me laugh although i think that was a very important drama scene.finally i would like to thank the author and the director for such a master piece although i have to ask why again the tower thing, as an Arab i hate to think that ppl will recall that memory again and re-generate all the bad feelings that they had for us all over the gain, i think they just added salt to an nearly closed wound and made it bleed again, and it really wasn't necessary they could have killed him with any other way and it won't change a thing about the movie. anyway although that i really loved it and enjoyed it.",Remember Me

Really enjoying the film and thinking after they had declared their love for each other, that something was bound to spoilt it. It was only when the teacher had written the date on the board, that everything started to fall into place.

I have seen Twilight due to my girlfriend and good friend being huge fans of the Saga. I'll tell you, all I could think of before I saw his film was Twilight because whenever anyone talks or thinks about Rob Pattinson, Twilight is somehow involved. I left this film with a newfound respect for Rob and the entire cast of this film. It was not was I was expecting at all (in terms of story line) and showed that Rob does have a decent range of acting. To me the casting was superb. Everyone was perfectly cast, and I sat there speechless at the end credits. I say absolutely see it. But do note it's not your typical love story.",Remember Me
250,greenflash,Touching,8,13 March 2010,"Well scripted. Thoughtful exploration on themes of grief and appreciation of life expressed through action more then exposition. Its effects lingered with me long after I left the theater. Pattinson's performance well conveyed the frustrated, pent-up intensity appropriate to the age, stage of development, and situation of his character. Emilie de Ravin's restrained portrayal of a wounded young woman who struggles to define her identity while still living under the roof of a controlling overprotective father who expresses his love with his iron will, sets the stage for a complex but enduring romantic bond. Caitlyn Rund's clean portrayal of the artistic and smart but vulnerable eleven year old sister serves as both a mirror-of-truth for Pattinson's youthful uncompromising if myopic ways, and as a safe and central focus for everyone's love and protection. Overall I found Remember Me to be a fine example of how the art of film can really serve its audience at a heart level.",Remember Me
251,TGNorton14,Did I see the same movie as everyone else?,1,13 March 2010,"This was by far the most painful 2 hours of my life and the fact that anyone who actually sat through this movie would have anything good to say about it is ASTOUNDING to me. I have never written a review before but I had such a profound negative reaction to this movie that I couldn't just sit here and let all of these other people give this movie a good review based on their feelings for Edward Cullen. Are people really so enthralled by Robert Pattinson and Twilight that they can overlook the plethora of problems with this movie? There are so many issues with every aspect of this movie I would need a year to list them all.The acting in this movie is atrocious and I'm not just talking about the ""American"" accents that these actors attempted. Although Emile de Ravin's attempt at an American accent was actually laughable at certain times and I really really like her. And Robert Pattinson? REALLY PEOPLE? Did you not see the scene where is yells at his father in the board room? His delivery is completely lifeless and yet over the top at the same time. What is really amazing is that the ""character"" he was playing is essentially him! The dirty hair, the hipster clothes and the ""I don't give a damn"" mentality are all things that he should be able to pull off. How does one screw up playing themselves so royally? And I don't even know where to begin with the God awful script. Even overlooking the wildly offensive ending the story is a failure.The theater where I saw this movie was full and about half of the people walked out. I felt like an idiot for staying the entire time. My recommendation to anyone thinking of seeing this movie is to perform a lobotomy on yourself as I am certain this would be much less painful than sitting through this movie. This makes Glitter look Oscar worthy.",Remember Me

The father-daughter relationship directly oppositional to the Father-Son relationship (one is over-protective, the other not protective enough) was interesting in its contrast. The ""set up"" was a little (no a lot) clichéd but that didn't bother me as much as the ending, which felt like a giant jolt - much like the drop on a roller-coaster ride.Peirce Brosnan was pretty OK and Chris Cooper - no matter what role hes given, always does his best.

While watching it, I didn't see Edward, or Cedric, I saw Tyler, this amazing, heartfelt man, with a terrible father figure. I couldn't stand his father from the first time I met him. Same with Ally's father.I loved Caroline, I loved everything about her. She was so witty, and talented, and she didn't deserve anything those girls put her through, I couldn't help but cheer when Tyler shoved that girls desk. But when I saw that date on the blackboard, I couldn't help but start to cry. Everything was going so right, finally, his father started to prove his love for his children. Him and Ally were perfect together, they were in love. Caroline was happier. But it was obviously too good to be true. I never even began to think this would be about nine/eleven, but i was obviously proved wrong.I started into this movie, thinking it would be a soppy love story. i was wrong, it's an intense, perfectly acted movie that could even the toughest man to tears.

Robert Pattinson's casting might deter some people from going to see this film but it shouldn't. I expected the cinemas to be filled with twilight fan girls but surprisingly the majority of the people in our screening were older than me (21) and seemed to thoroughly enjoy the film. The story is moving and gripping with a very unexpected ending that just leaves you speechless. The actors are amazing in it. Robert and Emilie have great chemistry and Pierce Brosnan, as always, gives a great performance. The true star I felt was Ruby Jerins, who played Robert's younger sister. She's such a great actress and her chemistry with Robert was amazing. This film deserves to do well and I hope people don't avoid it because of Robert's terrible acting in Twilight.

Every character is well defined, every character becomes painfully real and as an audience we are part of it. It left me sad but was catharsis for my own personal issues and thoughts.If nothing else, I have recognized the amazing talents of Robert Pattison whose portrayal is simply brilliant. Pierce Bronson has a knack for choosing amazing films to which there is something for each of us to identify with. And Pattison's best friend, I think is an actor named Emile plays his part beautifully and is a perfect compliment to the other actors. This is a love story, I will remember, always.

The directing was fantastic and truly embodied what the world of film is about. The acting was stunning and proved that even the most emotionless person could feel what the characters were feeling. The movie made me forget that Robert Pattinson was even in the Twilight movies and once again proved his worth as an actor (after having viewed his other works).

Very powerful",9,25 July 2010,"I hope this review gets to those people who would never, in a million years, would consider seeing this movie. I was one of them. I'm not a Rob or Twilight hater, but I'm a crappy emo/moody movie hater... and judging by the previews, I thought this was going to be a movie about two troubled teenagers who fall in love and it's all cliché and they help each other blah blah. I was so, so wrong. Not going to lie, there were quite a few scenes I literally laughed at because they were a little too broody, but now that I think about it, those made the movie more real than I could have every imagined. I promise you will not regret seeing this movie... that is all I will say without spoiling anything. Just go see it. The end is a complete shock, it leaves you speechless, and it truly makes the movie one to remember.Now for my actual review.My cousin and I decided to watch this because there was absolutely nothing to do and her mom had just bought the DVD. We were both expecting to make fun of it... boy, was I wrong. The opening scene lets you know this is not going to be just some sappy love story about two emo kids who find each other. Rob and Emilie have an amazing chemistry, and I found myself smiling, laughing, and crying with these characters. Tyler was surprisingly charming and funny, something I never would have expected out of a Rob Patttinson character. Yes, he was all troubled and what not, but it wasn't overplayed and you could literally feel his pain and you knew exactly why he did what he did. His younger sister stole every scene, was lovable and even relatable (who didn't know at least one mean girl growing up...) and Ally was witty and independent, very very likable. I loved her.However, this movie wasn't really about Tyler and Ally's relationship. I'm pretty sure only about 30% was actual ""romance"" and the typical love story. No- this movie was about two very different families, with real life issues and touching stories. Each character had depth and they made you feel for them because you just knew everyone wanted things to be alright- there was no bad guy, the troubles inside each family were simply one of those shitty life situations that no one can help. Tyler and Ally were just the connection between these two families- in all honesty, I think this movie could have made it without their relationship. However, their love story makes the movie even more likable. These two were able to help each other, and I fell in love with both of their characters and their relationship. You were rooting for them the entire time and it was wonderfully woven into each of their stories.Now, of course, some parts were a little too eh, and others a little too broody for my taste. I thought the story was very interesting, but there seemed to be no beginning, no middle, no climax, no end. I remember I commented to my cousin how I don't get the movie because even though I was into it, it seemed to be heading nowhere. It was like just watching people lead their (very) complicated lives. There was no rising action, no anything. I didn't understand why this was until the end *SPOILER ALERT*. The September 11th thing came as a complete shock. I was taken completely off guard- it was clear the movie took place a few years back (they went to see American Pie 2 at the theater) but it was something you would have never expected. Even doing the math when they talk about Michael's death wouldn't have made you think twice about the date.That's why I think this movie was so beautiful and touching. The reason why, I think, critics are so harsh is because it doesn't play like a regular movie. Like I said, there is not beginning, no rising action, no climax. It drags a little because it plays like real life. BUT THATS WHAT IT'S MEANT TO FEEL LIKE. The reason why it was like that is because it makes the viewer realize that one moment, you're just living, and the next, you could be gone. Tyler's life was finally starting to fall together, and then BAM. It ended. It's such a powerful message. Life has no rising action, no climax, no anything. It's just a story that could end any minute. Just like the movie, in real life, the story doesn't have to finish. Sometimes it just ends halfway through a good part. That's why Ally's prerogative is so crucial- why wait until the end to enjoy what you want the most? You never know. This movie leaves you thinking and it actually makes you feel empty for a little bit. I feel it captures the events of Sept 11th very well, and it's not offensive at all. It's just honest. Those who hate this movie just fail to see the message- live life to the fullest. It's so cliché, but this movie was done so well that you almost felt like part of the family- you felt as if this was your story- and to have it end so suddenly and horribly makes you feel that emptiness and lets one realize that maybe, yes, you should have dessert first.This one is now one of my favorites- I sincerely hope it gathers a following and becomes one of those movies that, in 20, 30 years, people will wonder why it was so unpopular when it came out.",Remember Me
263,curalove,Well acted and unexpected,7,4 March 2010,"I attended a screening of ""Remember Me"" and thought it was a pretty good movie. I'm a big Rob fan but I'm trying my best to be objective here. I'll say this - if you are a Rob fan it is basically about two hours of heaven. My fan girl self wants to give it 10 stars - but I have to post what my movie fan self would rate it. It was nice to see him in something other than Twilight movies and I think he will surprise some of his naysayers. If you can give or take Rob and are just looking for a good movie to see what I'll say is this - it won't win any awards or anything but it was well acted and the story was interesting and unexpected. My caution to you if you are checking for reviews for this movie before seeing it - make sure you take any ""Contains spoiler"" warnings seriously. You are better off going into it blind. I would steer clear of these reviews until after you have seen it. In fact - I wouldn't do any reading about it anywhere or watch any interviews just to be safe. Just my two cents.",Remember Me

265,rock_n_roll_grl,Robert at his best.... Outstanding film,10,4 January 2013,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, I always end up in tears. I was Caroline's age on that day in September. Not know what was going on and being in school just made kids worry.This film is one of Robert Pattinson's best performances. The movie makes you fall in love with the characters. It tells a story that anyone and everyone can put themselves in one of the actors shoes. This movie hits home for EVERYONE. Whether you were in NYC or not, whether you lost someone or not, everyone was different after that day.The film is outstanding and I fell in love with it after the first time watching it. It may not be based on a fully true story, but it is based on a real event (9/11) and everyone involved with that day could relate to the film. Life going on, day in and day out, nothing unusual. A beautiful September morning. And out of the blue, something horrible happened. Lives were lost, people were lost. Someone lost a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a son, a daughter, etc. This is a movie that tells the story of these peoples lives in a general way. These people were doing their everyday normal routine and didn't know what would happen on that morning.The writers did a great job with the script and screenplay. 10 out of 10 from me.",Remember Me

I have daughters to do that kind of thing for me. I rented the film because my list on Blockbuster was low and I thought the trailer looked passable. I was more than pleasantly surprised! This film has heart, brain, humour and soul without being cheesy, preachy or nauseating. Robert Pattinson can actually act which came as a surprise having sat through Twilight and New Moon. If this film hadn't had such an appealing supporting cast, I would never have found this out but I love Chris Cooper and Lena Olin, and Pierce Brosnin's small films are always far better choices than his blockbusters. I think this film also had a special resonance for me as I was in America at the time this is set and perhaps I would not have enjoyed it quite so much without this insight.",Remember Me
267,peace-out,Extremely underrated,10,19 March 2010,"I went into the movie thinking it was going to be another cheesy love story, but i was completely blown away by this film. I thought the acting was spectacular and the story line was extremely moving. There was nothing ordinary or expected about it. It was very touching and cognitively stimulating, I highly recommend it. Every single subplot was interesting and everything tied together in the end. The characters were all unique, human, and likable. I felt for the characters as if I was in the situation because I was so emotionally invested in the story. It has a great message and theme about life and how we should go about living it. It also displays touching amounts of care for loved ones and is very inspiring. I don't think anyone who goes to see it will be disappointed.",Remember Me

Going to this movie naive, made it work for me.I was at a screening of this movie tonight and wasn't looking forward to seeing it, but, did so to make my wife happy. In the end, it was a totally unexpected, heart rendering, emotional roller coaster ride of a movie. I sit here now a grown man who feels absolutely exhausted, but not from the agony having to watch the movie, but from the bipolar like seesaw of joy/agony/hope/desperation which this movie takes you through.When I saw the guy from the vampire flicks, I expected a teenage type romantic comedy or the like and this film was anything but comedy. By the end of the movie Pattinson earned my respect as an actor and his supporting cast was pretty good as well.The movie gets a bit slow at times, especially for fans of Twilight movies, but if you are patient, and pay attention to the characters they will draw you in and time will fly. And, in the end, you will think it was worth every minute spent watching.As you can tell, I really liked this movie a lot.My only complaint was Robs smoking... ;-)",Remember Me

Can't wait to see what both actors do next. Love the ending, didn't see it coming. I will remember this film forever. I love how the characters were introduced to the audience and each had their little life troubles.

The acting was superb and the story was life-like. you understood them and you felt for them, you cried, you laughed, and you cheered them along. At first I didn't get the title I thought it was just random in essence, but by the end of the movie I understood what he meant by remember me, remember my life, remember my story, and remember the 3000 other people and their stories that were ended on that day. So final result is, that this movie was amazing, the acting against all expectations including mine was superb, it showed how wrong we can be by judging actors by preset opinions. the story showed us how fickle Fate can be in life and death, and how one should live their life to its utmost because quite simply your story can end any time, whether on a subway platform or from a terrorist attack. write your story so that others will remember you.

271,lyzee88,Surprised by Pattinson's genuine acting skills.,10,13 March 2010,"Although the plot was slightly hard to connect to and the seg-ways at times seemed shallow, you cannot deny the original, genuine dramatic twists this story holds. It will grip you from beginning to end. Pattinson's acting chops are borderline award-worthy. He makes your chest ache vicariously. A must see. But don't bother going if you already have stubborn ill preconceived ideas about the twilight heartthrob. Have an open mind. Tyler and Edward Cullen are not the same! The ending is a bit far fetched, as is the ""intense break up scene"" which is almost absurd. The fact that Ally dumps him over that is just silly. But other than that, the story is solid, rich and entertaining. Tyler's roommate provides great comic relief in an otherwise dark and brooding screen play. Tyler's little sister provides great side story and his relationship with her will make your heart melt. See it. You won't regret it.",Remember Me

So this is my unbiased opinion.I saw a screening of this movie last night. I went into it not knowing what to expect. I was drawn in on the opening scene and it held my attention all the way through. All the characters were perfectly cast. Robert fit his role excellently, his best friend/roommate was a good comic relief and was perfect to have for such a heavy movie. The lead girl was a perfect fit, the whole family seemed like a real family and Rob's bond with his little sister even came off real on screen. You connect with the story and feel for the characters. Definitely not a light hearted movie, just when things get good for Rob something goes wrong. Completely unexpected twist at the end, but beautifully and very well done.I highly recommend this movie, and I really hope it gets the attention it deserves and not just the twilight crowd.",Remember Me

It looked like it had all the makings of a gushy, chick-flick-a film that I really wasn't in the mood for. However, much to my surprise, I really enjoyed this film. The story line was interesting with great sub-plots. Rob Pattinson shines in the lead and engages the audience with a range of different emotions. The acting is natural and very believable. Throughout the film, I was entertained by the superb acting. There were those characters I sympathized with, those I hated and in the case of Pearse Brosnan's character, learned to love. The ending caught the audience by surprise and left many in tears, due to the cold truth behind the acting. We realize that stories like these really did happen. People lost people they loved, we all felt the hurt. These emotions were beautifully portrayed in the film. I felt like the film taught me to tell those I love that I love them, because someday it could be too late. Films usually don't affect me. This one did. Go see it!",Remember Me

This one did. At some point in the movie I forgot I was even watching Robert Pattinson. He was simply Tyler Hawkins. If you don't like Twilight, don't worry about it. This is far from it. Even the acting is 200% better! (And I LOVE Twilight!) The story is amazing! The trailers make this film out to be the typical chick flick, but it is far from it. This is one for women and men alike!

Robert Pattinson was really good, I don't know why some people say he can't act. he really can. I saw him in Twilight movies also where he is really not so good, to be honest. but this character Tyler was suitable for him. I enjoyed the work of all cast and I really cared about the main characters story. it was so real, love with all advantages and disadvantages and not a fairytale. it is life - just like it was pictured in the movie.

The soundtrack is well chosen and kind of anticipates the ending, which is unpredictable though.

The ending was art in film at its best! It was poignant and felt real and raw.Robert Pattinson has proved in this movie that he is indeed going to be a ""Harrison Ford"" and not a ""Mark Hamill"" in Hollywood. I think we will be seeing a lot more to come from him, and I am invested in following his journey as I suspect he is not likely to fall victim to work just to please the suits and grease the ""Machine's"" money making wheels. He cares about the roles he picks, and that says a lot about his character as an actor and as a person. This is an actor I can be proud to be a fan of.Ruby Jerins...Rob was not joking when he said she's the next Meryl Streep, Holy cow! She's only how old? I was mesmerized by her performance in every scene! I see her following in Dakota Fanning's foot steps and I look forward to seeing her in future projects.Emilie De Ravin...you had me at hello.

As much as Twilight fans will hate to admit it, there was definite on screen chemistry there.Tate Ellington, bravo for your gritty comic relief.

Emily is also superb in his role, manages to convey sweetness and strength of mind at a time. Chris Cooper loves this man seriously as acts I love, I love all the scenes with Rob and Emilie. For my part I laughed a lot with the Tate was a plus for the film and a beautiful girl Ruby loves the college scene is actually one of my favorites.The movie ""despite"" being intimate and free of all these impressive and expensive special effects that are so fashionable in other productions, get hooked from the start and shrugging his heart at the end when you realize the ""where and when ""leading events ...

But, after viewing the film, their distaste, in my opinion, comes across as incredibly phony.

The movie got good reviews from many of the more respected critics, like USA today and Roger Ebert, to name a few. Anyway, the movie was brilliant and my take on it was that it was a beautiful love story and a very touching tribute to the events of the day, a reminder that sometimes we get lost in numbers and forget that each and every individual that was taken that day had their own personal story. Robert's acting was amazing as was the other cast members. From those that have seen it such as myself there is about an 80% or higher approval rating. Robert Pattinson deserves a lot of credit for the boldness in taking on this script so early in his career and getting the movie made, especially as many critics have taken the opportunity to discredit it so harshly for it's supposed controversial ending - like this is the first movie ever made to encompass a love story around a tragedy.

287,cartoon_gal,"Really Touching, Not Exploitive AT ALL",9,14 March 2010,"I LOVED IT. I was worried at first because it was slow. Once Ally came into the picture, however, I pretty much fell in love with the whole movie. Emilie de Ravin and Robert Pattinson played off of each other so incredibly well. The acting in the film was fantastic, and the storyline was so moving. I realize that it's not for everybody, but I cannot think of the last time that I saw a movie that developed relationships between the characters so well. I found Aiden's relationship with Caroline and Tyler so freaking cute, even though his character was slightly annoying. Robert Pattinson, I thought, was really amazing. I didn't think he was at all like Edward Cullen, like so many reviewers/critics are saying. Like I wrote above, his relationship with his sister was what made me fall in love with Tyler. I cannot get over how much chemistry he creates with his fellow actors. SPOILERS AHEAD:And, my goodness, Caroline (I can't remember the actress's name). She was so freaking cute! I started crying when those little bitches cut her hair and then tried blaming it on her. Kids really are getting meaner and meaner; it reminded me of my younger cousin who was bullied by girls at her school. It's so stupid that schools don't have the jurisdiction to handle such matters since they don't happen on school grounds (though I understand why that is the case...) I just absolutely loved every minute this little girl was on screen, and her relationship with Tyler was so compelling and so sweet. As for the ending, I for the life of me cannot understand why it offended so many people. That was definitely NOT using a ""recent"" tragedy as a plot ploy. In fact, the whole 9/11 aspect isn't what even really got me bawling in the theater; it was the fact that Tyler realized that his dad really was a good person and a loving father, but that he'd never have the chance to fix the relationship. That was just heartbreaking. I am not saying that it didn't impact my emotions at all because I still cry every September 11 when the media does the tributes to the victims and the families (yes, I'm a huge softie). But, like I just mentioned, that is not what set me into near hysterics (see previous softie reference). I dragged my friend with me, who is in her 30's and not a huge Twilight or Robert Pattinson fan (I'm a huge fan of the latter because I thought he was brilliant in How To Be). She absolutely loved it, and she was bawling right with me at the end. She said she actually started crying during the scene where Tyler confronted his father during the meeting about skipping out on Caroline's art showing. She is a big period/historical-film, horror, and sci-fi fanatic, so this genre is really not her cup of tea. Again, she was really impressed with the story and the acting.Overall, I loved the film, and I cannot wait to take my little (a.k.a. 20 year old haha) sister to see it in a few days. If you're looking for a touching film that develops characters' relationships with each other in depth, as well as a good old tearjerker, I highly recommend the film.",Remember Me

I admit it is not a happy story but life isn't rainbows and unicorns. It showed real people just living their lives and how it can be taken away from you in an instant. I found no disrespect in this movie at all. It was beautifully done and I applaud Robert Pattinson for having the guts to do this kind of movie because these sorts of movies are rare.It will make you laugh and cry...it will break your heart, but I believe you will leave thinking about these characters and the people in your own life.

290,stings_girlfriend,Amazing and thought-provoking,10,12 March 2010,"Remember Me is a film about grieving, broken people struggling to live their lives. Both families feel natural and true. Robert Pattinson, Chris Cooper, Ruby Jenins, Emilie de Ravin and Pierce Brosnan perform brilliantly. These people bring to life, through their characters, the volatility of grief, lies, and unspoken sentiments. There are emotional highs and lows and some comic relief from the roommate character. I was not sure what to expect from Robert and was extremely satisfied with how fast I forgot the vampire. He made Tyler so real that I lost myself in his life. I appreciate a film that makes me forget every little detail of my own life. I expect film to take me away to another place, another life. Remember Me does that. The film reminds me of family dramas like Ordinary People. Emotions I have never experienced are brought to me in a way I can truly feel.

I will only say that the story is compelling, funny, romantic and chuck full of emotional turmoil. But most amazing of all was the fact that all the strangers in the movie theatre, including myself, left at the end of the movie in shock and utter complete silence.This is one amazing story and excellent performances by all actors. Even I, a veteran movie spoiler, did not see it coming. You got me in the best way possible, as a native born New Yorker, I loved the movie and the plot.

However, a friend and I went to this movie, not just because it stars Rob Pattinson, but because the trailers appealed to us. I can easily say that it more than lived up to any expectations I walked in with. From the very start of the movie, I was so enthralled with the twists and turns and the unbelievably emotional lives of the characters. The opening scene is just as unexpected and heart-wrenching as the last. Even this morning, after seeing the movie last night, I am still feeling very emotional.

It seemed as though I was walking into a very Nicholas Sparks-esk movie. I was pleasantly surprised by what the movie had in store for its viewers though.The movie was in no way predicable. It told the tale of two emotionally distraught college students, who by twists of fate find solace in each others company. Between fatherly issues, adorable 11 year old sisters, and hyper active best friends, the movie completed the lives of this couple without over extending the plot. Every character, scene, and moment fit perfectly. Throughout the seriousness there were moments in which you couldn't help but smile. From water fights inside houses to love scenes that make you long for this perfect love.The movie leaves you pondering how it could end throughout the whole thing. It seemed impossible to end the movie in a way that would leave someone riveted. And yet this movie covered that too. It has one of those endings that no one could ever predict and will leave you saying ""Wow..."" for hours after.In all the movie was one of the most unique and powerful that cinemas have produced lately. I recommend it to anyone looking for a change from the every day movie.",Remember Me

If you pay attention and don't just write it off as another form of Edward Cullen, you will hear and see why he is so tortured and in pain while trying hard to get thru to his Dad and protecting his little sister. He did a fantastic job and I loved it. The ending I did not see coming but it was tasteful and well done. The sadness was true and evident in the faces of the cast, and it should not offend anyone in any way.

This movie is NOT for young teenagers! I know a lot of young twilight fans will want to see this, but the movie other than having Robert and Love, is not at all similar.

Robert Pattinson deserves his fame. I am convinced that he is one of the most talented actors his generation. Many Thanks to Mr. Pattinson for putting his heart and soul into this small movie. This is a movie that everybody should watch. However, some movie critics don't think so. It looks like they are trying to kill this movie before it reach to mass audience.

Robert was able to completely deliver himself into this role, and his acting proved to be all of authentic, fierce and yet tender. Let there be no more debate as to whether he is worth his career; He is above and beyond it! I'm truly convinced that the portrayed relationships of these characters alone are a rare achievement to film making. As for his younger sister, played by Ruby Jerins, I couldn't be more impressed. She is so incredibly talented, and the touching relationship of these two characters couldn't be more sweet and personal to myself. All together, (for I can't make you read a thousand page review!) I can attest the entire theatre was captivated and touched.But what made this movie was the ending. As for that...let's just say you'll leave the theater shaking. Mr. Coulter and of course Summit, I tip my hat to you. Well worth the change at the box office! But hey now, don't take my word for it. Go get your popcorn, relax in the dark, and see for yourself.

The supporting casts were good as well; the scenes with Tyler and his father and Tyler and his sister were exceptional. The movie steadily builds up to the climax, it was paced really well, as the movie went on it got better and better. It is an intense emotional movie about everyday people coping with lost and survival. Rob is a breath of fresh air and I look forward to seeing him in other movies.

BUT I went to see the movie anyway to support his work. I was completely shocked at how GOOD this movie is.I think it was tastefully done. I think the acting is superb. Taylor's roommate makes the movie. He is very funny and enjoyable to watch. I thought the love scenes were steamy. I could feel the little girl's pain and Taylor's anger. I thought Rob was extremely HOT as a tough guy.I am so happy to see that he is acting in movies that are well written and enjoyable for a wider audience than just the ""teen population"".

Some i have heard complain about certain scenes but truthfully, if you have ever suffered any of the losses or pains that these people have, they would realize that the actions are spot on! I am wowed by the movie, stunned truly... I am also very glad that this movie was made, not as eye candy for Pattinson but rather to show his and others talent on such a touching, difficult, and painful subject.

She, like many other movie-goers, was lured to this movie for no other reason than that she saw the ""oh-so-famous"" vampire, Robert Pattinson, in another ""love-story"". Robert plays an angry, drunk, depressed college guy with an over-sexed room-mate. The ""love-story"" she was hoping for really only turned out to be a couple of unnecessary, lusty sex-scenes that really didn't fit. His acting in this movie was sub par to what was expected from his past work in the Twilight Series.To the story-line...I waited almost an hour and a half waiting for something to actually happen that contributed to the story line. During that first section, I wasn't completely sure who the movie was actually about. Was it about a college boy? The boy's sister? Dead brother? Father? It was very vague on who I should actually pay most attention to. Sure, the tag-line was ""Live in the moment."" but that doesn't mean that the movie should be a big jumble of ""moments"" mashed into a screenplay. The plot was that of a good, ten-minute You-Tube documentary, that's only meaning is to prove a point, not to entertain.Now the last 20-or-so minutes of the film was okay. There was some actual plot development. However, I wished that the development would have started sooner. The actual point of the movie was made in the last two minutes, which did surprise me. It was a good point to make, but it shouldn't have taken a boring, long time to make it.Overall, the film was okay. It was advertised as a love-story, which it wasn't. It had very little, and quite boring plot development, with an ending that lets you down. I walked out of the theater with a slight frown on my face.",Remember Me

Did I just see the same movie I have heard several professional movie critics review negatively or indifferently? The first review I read online for Remember Me was that it was trite, predictable, and drawn out. (Bull, I say.) The responses of those around me in the theater today proved those claims false as well. I saw people laughing, gasping, wincing, and weeping. I saw the audience RELATING.The characters are multi-dimensional and the acting is fantastic. This movie was not just feel-good fluff. It was not a platform to showcase Brosnan and Pattinson as eye candy. It was thought-provoking and intense. The characters were brooding, wounded, lovable and believable. The movie's twist was unique and effective.If you want to see an enjoyable movie that will challenge your emotions and leave you feeling appropriately introspective, Remember Me fits the bills perfectly.

I am neither a Rob fan nor a twilight fan, but I personally think that Twilight was less painful to watch than Remember Me. The flow, the acting (especially of Emilie de Ravin and Pierce Brosnan - very disappointing!), and the plot were just terrifying. I saw no what-so-ever point in bringing up 9-11 into this movie, and I saw no point in showing the tragic event by the subway in the beginning, when it did so little in adding to the plot. I waited through the 113 minutes, expecting at least a decent ending, but the ending was just........um............really expected and not convincing, just like the whole movie itself.If you really want to see a cliché movie that tries really hard to seem artistic, here's a movie for you.

It is a complex, multi-layered story that subtly draws you into the lives of two families who are living with and dealing with how tragedy has defined them. Don't mistake this as simply a chick flick or love story. It is a portrait of the impact of human beings. By the end of the movie (which was spoiled for me in advance but no less powerful) I was completely invested in the characters. The entire cast was incredible and Robert Pattinson very capably showed that he has talent that will sustain him far beyond Twilight.

We'd only seen him in ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon,"" and neither of those is exactly high art. Imagine our surprise at the way the film immediately drew us in.The parental issues hit home instantly for me and I found myself holding my breath and holding back tears at the exchanges between father and son. I certainly never expected the loving older brother or even the protective older brother. I was rooting for him in the classroom.The ending was unexpected and very tastefully done. I feel that perhaps just enough time has passed now for a story to be built around that fateful day. I also felt that the lack of images from that day was even more profound than if a barrage of already-seen images were used to grab our attention. The viewer was left with only the look on other's faces. To me, that was more gripping than a blatant use of old footage.Go see the movie; I don't believe you will be disappointed.

I must admit that yes I'm a fan of Robert Pattinson because of Twilight but he proved that he's actually better than just an actor in a teenager movie like Twilight and that he can hold his own in a serious drama such as Remember Me. I loved the message in this movie about life's unexpected events and how you choose to let those unexpected events impact your life.

I felt that Robert Pattinson did a great job portraying the character that he did, as a quirky yet passionate young man, who struck me as a old soul. His co-stars each held their own as well. This movie had everything, different generations, art and expression, divorce, families torn apart, families brought back together through heart wrenching obstacles, murder, suicide, partying, love, police corruption, drama, school peers, tragedy, hatred and cruelty, friendships, humor, sarcasm, high powered moguls and an crazy twist at the end!

I am so glad we did. This is the best film I've seen in years. Rob Pattinson as Tyler, gave a brilliant performance that one moment made me smile, and the next made me cry. I liked Tyler. Also the interaction between Tyler and his friend Aidan was so typical it reminded me of my Grandsons and their friends who are about the same age.

They're an okay couple I guess. I have a feeling this movie might suck.. please don't disappoint me Robert!""As I continued watching, I realized that his American accent got A LOT better, especially compared to how it was in Twilight - he genuinely sounds American! I was pretty impressed at that part, and the fact that he took on the role really well.Back to Remember Me, I thought it was SUCH a good story. It's one of those movies that ends with a twist, sort of.. catches you off guard. I mean... I had NO idea what to expect except for a few 'steamy scenes', fighting, smoking, and Robert awkwardly riding a bike at night. The beginning starts off a bit unclear (which might just be me), but it started becoming more understandable as the story went on. This movie actually made me cry.. like three times :P And I don't cry at stupid movies... often x] So that's how you know this is actually worth watching!I'll admit though, even though I said this wasn't gonna be a Robert Pattinson post, he was a big factor as to why I wanted to watch the movie. Although he's not a big reason why i love this movie, if he wasn't the main character, if he hadn't gotten so much promo for the movie, I probably wouldn't have ended up watching it. But I am so glad I did, and I'm really glad they chose him to play the character. One, because he did an excellent job, and two, because he made the movie a lot more popular than it would have been if it was someone else. Not saying he makes the movie what it is, but come on, it's ""Edward Cullen"" - every girl's 'dream guy'.Anyways, if you're still reading this post, props goes to you!

It's not your typical ""romance"" story - and that's actually what I was expecting when I went to see it, but it's not. There's great story lines with his friend, parents, sister, lover. Robert P. is a darn good actor, just give him a chance, and forget about him portraying a vampire. He makes this movie. He has star quality up on the big screen, I wish I knew when the NYC premiere was going to be, I would have gone down there with friends!

The relationship Tyler has with his sister is remarkably touching and quite a contrast to the relationship between Tyler and his father which is strained to the point of breaking. The characters were well cast and the story was well written. I was also surprised by the performance given by Robert Pattinson. His Twilight movies do not showcase his acting skills.

Emilie De Ravin and Robert Pattinson play Ally and Tyler, who both have a history of family tragedy. The theme of grief and loss is prominent--the movie explores how Ally and Tyler as well as their families have dealt with loss. Ally and Tyler fit together like pieces in a puzzle; Tyler has become cynical and angry since his brother's death, while Ally lives life to its fullest since the violent death in her family. They heal each other and also have some fun, sexy scenes together. I found it totally believable and attribute that to Emily de Ravin and Robert Pattinson's stellar acting and great chemistry.Besides their love story, it's about family relationships and conflict--particularly the rage that Tyler feels towards his Dad for neglecting his little sister Caroline, and the struggle for independence from her over-protective father that Ally and her dad experience. Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan, who play Ally and Tyler's Dads, are outstanding actors who make the film even more layered and believable. Caroline, played by Ruby Jerins, is a phenomenal young actress, and she and Tyler are wonderful together in every scene they share. The ending of the film was integral to the movie, in that the theme of grief and loss on a personal and family level was carried to a more universal level in a tasteful, meaningful way. Totally loved the movie.",Remember Me

This is a very intense movie. The trailers are okay but the movie is so much more than that. I highly recommend this movie to readers. It is very powerful and touches on very heavy topics. It is in one way the best movie you will ever see. There will never be a movie quite like this. This is not a predictable movie. I paid $6 to get in, but I would have payed much more.

I really don't get it---it's possible that critics feel like they have to smirk at a Robert Pattinson movie. But he's a good actor, and Emilie Ravin, Pierce Brosnan, and the girl who played Pattinson's little sister were also strong. This actually might be my favorite performance by Pierce Brosnan. Rob's character was a distinct and believable 22-year-old personality, and he and Ravin had great chemistry.

322,mayblle,Don't listen to negative reviewers...and see this film!,10,20 March 2010,"This movie has been getting a lot of criticism, partially because of Robert Pattinson (Twilight's Edward) and partially due to the ending.It's time people get over the Twilight thing. Robert Pattinson was really quite good, especially since his American accent has improved to the point where it no longer sounds as though he's mumbling and can actually get emotion through. He and Emilie de Ravan have great chemistry, and the scenes with the little girl who plays his sister are just adorable.*Spoilers* As for the ending, it totally and completely took me by surprise. I was only dimly aware that the movie was set in 2001 (at the beginning it says 1991 and then ""ten years later"" but I was assuming it was set in present year, 2010) but when the teacher says, ""Caroline, pay attention,"" and the girl looks up at the board and you see the date is September eleventh, and then you're shown that Robert Pattinson is in one of the Twin Towers...It left me absolutely speechless. It was phenomenal. It was an inspiration for film-making. I couldn't stop thinking of it after. People say it's too personal a topic to be made into a film, too tragic, but what about other films based on tragedy? The sinking of the Titanic was certainly no lighthearted affair, and yet that movie is the second largest grossing film worldwide. And what about the numerous rape, abduction, and murder shows on TV? No, it being too tragic for the screen is a flimsy argument.Then there are those who say that it came as too big a surprise. Maybe 9/11 is not too tragic, but they could at least warn a person. But 9/11 WAS a surprise. The only ones who saw it coming were those involved in planning it. And that's possibly the whole point of the film. You have a life, one life, and one chance to live it, and you'd better live it because you don't know what might end it or when it may be ended.*Spoilers over* This movie was, in my opinion, remarkable. It's not just some chick flick and it's not just some sop story. OK, maybe it starts with an idea - boy asks girl out on revenge/dare, they bond over sad family pasts - that's been overused. But it becomes so much more than that. At the very least, see this movie yourself, and don't take the critics opinion. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",Remember Me

It was a remarkable effort and while occasionally a bit contrived, that was easy to look past. The portrayal of sudden loss, of survivors trying to deal with their feelings, of struggles with identity were magnificent. I was struck by what I felt were strong parallels to JD Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"", certainly not verbatim, but still too strong to be ignored. The middle child whose older brother has died and who has a strong relationship with his younger sister. His questions about his own identity. Even the use of the name Allie. Also the James Dean-type persona of Tyler Hawkins-recalls the movies and literature of an earlier age. Very moving and interesting movie. Additional Note: having now read many of the critics comments, and their dislike of the ending, I would like to quote a line by Tyler Hawkins in the movie: ""It's a metaphor"".",Remember Me

I loved seeing Robert Pattinson as someone other than Edward. Tyler is distant from his family besides his younger sister, *SPOILER* ever since his older brother committed suicide. Rob IS a good actor, and I do like seeing the Twilight stars in other movies 'cause it shows what they can actually do besides being vampires and werewolves. I didn't really like the actress playing Ally, I have to say. I don't know why, she just bothered me. (: *SPOILER* I never expected the ending to be like it was. My mother and I had thought something would happen to the younger sister, because she spaces in and out, and everyone thinks she's weird. But, that's not what it turned out to be at all. I'm surprised my cousin figured it out, even in the beginning. I guess I should've paid more attention in the first scene, since it was back in 1991 and then it went into ten years later, which I was kind of curious about. What my cousin also noticed that when Tyler was in the elevator, the button lit up said 87, and the setting in this movie is in New York City. The ending is really saddening, and I cried. I was in first grade when September 11th happened, and my mother did experience it, and it's still hard for her to talk about it, and it's been almost nine years. If she would've known that it based around 9/11, she wouldn't have gone to seen it. BUT I do recommend that whoever is reading this, to go and see it. It isn't all based around lovey-dovey stuff like the previews made it seem. It has a great storyline, and it isn't a waste of time and money. Rob lovers and haters should go see it.

Emilie was also very good her and rob and great chemistry.But.... i can see where the critics did not like the movie.. the whole bet thing and revenge but it was needed to start a relationship the ending was bittersweet 9/11 is a very sensitive subject and it affected everyone.

Everyone has their own story connected to 9/11 and when the teacher wrote the date on the board i began to cry then the shot of rob from the building put everything together i was speechless.

Basically I don't have much time to go see movies. I am VERY glad my friend talked me into seeing this while it was still in the theater.I had seen that the critics didn't really like this but hadn't seen any spoilers so I went into this movie not knowing more than that there was a love story between two people who had been affected by the death of a family member.As I arrived at the theater (I had to drive 30 miles to the city since my small hometown theater only had it for 2 weeks) I noted that most people were going to see one of the two ""big"" movies out now. I figured that was good, I'd have the smaller theater this was shown in mostly to myself. As it turned out there were about a dozen other people, mostly couples.If I could thank the writer, the director and the actors all personally for this movie I would. It was absolutely splendid. I walked away with several things from this movie, and even now, a day later I can't stop thinking about it. A movie has never made me feel this way before.I might also say I wasn't the only one who had to just sit for a time after the lights came up to get control the emotions that were coursing through me. There was not a dry eye in the theater, and the male of the couple sat in front of me said ""It was as good this time through as the first time we saw it."" This movie was an excellent reminder that we have to really live while we can. This movie was an excellent reminder that we did not just lose 3000+ people that day, we lost lives and futures and stories that should have ended differently. As time passes, wounds heal and we forget. We should never forget.At the end I was in love with all of the characters and when it became clear what was going to happen I didn't know which of these stories was going to end.This was extremely well written, well directed and well acted.

His head must be reeling right now, though, from the contradictory reasons the critics found to hate him. He spent most of the movie unshaven, his face bruised, scraped and swollen, his body hidden in shapeless, wrinkled clothes, yet the critics almost to a (jealouse) man, led off with a jibe at Rob's good looks and then continued to snicker. His acting was dismissed as ""wooden"" and ""inexpressive"" or it was ""overwrought and ""melodramatic"". The confrontation scene with his father was his ""finest moment"" or it was ""an embarrassment"". His American accent was derided. Well, what sort of American accent did they want? Wisconsin? Utah? Georgia? He gave us generic well-educated American with a slight Bronx undertone, and it convinced me. The movie was either ""slow and static"" or it ""veered from crisis to crisis"" (One reviewer accused it of both).

And they find each other, and basically mend each other and help the other get back on track.This film is an amazing love story and does hold a very dark twist at the end which me or my best friend definitely did not see coming!! But it was such a touching and moving film and really does show you what the power of love does to you.What surprised me was how simple the trailer made the film look but on the big screen it is quite definitely the opposite.

It shocks. It makes you think. It makes you respond.The story itself is not original, but it is real in a way that most of the spectators are able to recognize themselves in the characters.I enjoyed Pierce Brosnan's role – it was unexpected, but perfectly right. Robert Pattinson is a good actor. And he proves that in 'Remember Me' as well as he does in 'Little Ashes'. I think Chris Cooper is comfortably in his role. Emilie de Ravin's Ally Craig is a character that you want to align to. Not someone artificially perfect, but someone rather convincingly cool.More insightful spectators might forecast the scene finale ( but I would call the film 'beautifully cohesive' instead of 'predictable'), however the film is aesthetically and emotionally a pleasure. And actually you will keep rewinding it in your head after you leave the theatre, after you clean your teeth and go to bed and after you wake up another morning.'Remember Me' makes you think.

345,beeboo1520,Why all the negative reviews?,10,23 June 2010,"I really wanted to see this movie from the first time i saw a preview. I'm not a HUGE fan of Robert Pattinson. I cannot stand Twilight, so he was not my reason for seeing it (though I did enjoy him in Harry Potter GOF). However, I really enjoyed his acting in Remember Me. He really portrayed a disturbed, broken young man quite beautifully. There truly was an amazing collection of actors in this film. i really enjoyed Chris Cooper and Pierce Bronsan (even though the accent was pretty rough). Emilie de Ravin was a very wonderful actress. I don't understand the harsh reviews Tate Ellington received! I thought he was hilarious. Ruby Jerins was amazing. She is an actress I will look forward to seeing in future movies. Her scenes with Robert really touched my heart! *WARNING* spoilers ahead!!!! So I heard the ending was TERRIBLE! However, I disagree. 9/11 was such a terrible day. Watching the ending brought me back to that tragic day. I could truly feel and remember the sadness. I started getting choked up when Caroline's face crumpled when Tyler didn't come to pick her up. The tears really started coming when Ally was shown crying at the kitchen table, and her dad walked in and they embraced.Like I said, I really enjoyed the scenes with Rob and Ruby. Those moments were the highlights of the film, for me. It was evident that he really cared about her: walking her home from school everyday, standing up to that evil child who cut her hair, and doing everything in his power to get his father to come to her art show (even thought his plan failed).When he went to yell at his father for not coming, and his father started yelling back totally gave me the chills.Over all, I really enjoyed this movie. It is one of the best I've seen and i look forward to watching it again!",Remember Me

I was pulled along in this story, feeling everything that these characters, who were so well acted by the way, went through.It was raw but well done.There was absolutely no element of predictability and I just watched it over and over again. Especially after seeing it the first time, watching it again with commentary(I chose the commentary of the cast)just made it so much more real and amazing. It's a movie that you don't want to miss any aspect of and it's not as easy as seeing everything on the surface, although even if you do I'm sure that you can still grasp on the gem that this movie is.

The performances are all good, especially Pierce Brosnan. It is a very thought provoking film. It is about dealing with grief and the various ways that the characters deal with it. It also contains a love story. I did not react the way the critics did. They found the film to be manipulative, but all films do that to an audience to some degree. Many, many films use real life events to tell their story. I also like the piano music used in the film and it contributes to the tone of the film. This is a drama and a good one.",Remember Me
348,xlilzex,The first 5 minutes and last 5 minutes were good....,2,25 June 2010,"The movie's opening scene has a little girl witnessing something. Than the movie cuts to 10 years later. For the next half hour I found myself watching scene after scene with Robert Pattinson doing random things. All the while wondering to myself, ""wheres that little girl."" There was such a huge scene with her in the beginning and now shes gone. By the time she finally does come back, I didn't even care anymore. Well that was just the beginning of my frustrations. Horrible camera angles in action scenes, horrible lighting. Create a feel which made me want to pick fun at it, rather than follow along. Robert Pattinson plays a typical ""bad boy"" in a very generic plot. Basic plot outline : two young people with hidden pain, fall in love. They discover the other has hidden pain also and become closer. There's also another sub-plot thrown in, which honestly, felt very random. There's really only one scene where this ""sub-plot"" even comes into play. Robert acts like an immature, emotional bad boy throughout the whole movie. He will freak out, randomly! Then the ending is so unexpected! My mom walked in the room (she left 15 minutes into the movie because she didn't like it.) She starts asking if it was good. I didn't know what to say, it felt like the ending of a completely different movie. The ending basically makes Robert Pattinson look like an amazing person, but throughout the whole movie all that he is, is a young kid raw with emotions. NO REAL STORY STRUCTURE, NO SOLID PLOT!

I never write reviews but had to because I can't believe what the critics said and can't believe that people are rating this movie 1 out of 10. This film is easily one of the best ever, the acting is phenomenal and so believable. With most films you know its a story and that its being acted out but with this it feels so real and you actually feel for the characters as if it was real life. While I say that the amazing acting and chemistry made it so easy to watch, the director and the rest of the crew did a great job to make the film so flowing and believable, their only downfall being the trailer. I originally watched the film because Robert pattinson's in it and I thought it might reach the ""ok"" mark, the reason being was the trailer did nothing for the film, it made it look like a cliché film the same as the rest but it proved to be probably the most beautiful film I've ever watched. Even though I thought they could have done better on the trailer, I don't think they could fully justify the film in two minutes even with a great trailer. Its such a lovely, moving film that you can't sum it up really, it just needs to be seen to understand it. You'll probably be left in a soaking wet top by the end but its truly worth it and I just can't stress enough what an amazing piece of film making this is and whatever you do let a dislike for Robert pattinson steer you away from this film because you'll still love it.

I only wish I would have seen this movie in theaters because it was definitely worth seeing in the theater. The movie conveyed deep emotions and can connect with every American.

I cared deeply for the characters and it is a bittersweet tearjerker to boot.The love relationship had more realism to it than I've seen in a movie in a long time. It wasn't fairly-tail. It was based on two young people finding passionate first love and all the trimmings that go with that. The ending blew me away. Please don't let anyone give it away before you see it. All of the actors were exceptional. They all morphed into the people they played. I often find acting self-conscious. In other words, it's obvious they are acting. You are watching a personality, not a character. Not true with this movie at all.I also watched the special features and I believe the movie set out and accomplished what it meant to. It put a personality on an event that could remain at a distance to most of us. It changed me in that way forever. If you see this and don't get lost in emotion, you have no soul.

All the cast did a good job and were convincing. Now although this movie might fall under the genre of romance/love story it is different from the others and its not 'just the same old boy meets girl type of story'.I found this movie very enjoyable and flowing as i never got bored.

I have watched Robert Pattinson in other roles besides the Twilight Saga that I enjoyed, but this one took the crown. He immersed himself in this role so deeply that you forgot that he was Edward Cullen. You only saw Tyler, the troubled man who only wanted people to listen to him and understand his pain. Emilie De Ravin was a bit foreign to me prior to this film, but she also fit the role to a ""T"". These two could not have been replaced by other actors without changing the dynamic for the worse. By the end of the film, I was completely drained emotionally from the roller-coaster that I had been on. The finale shed the last amount of restraint I had left leaving me a tearful mess. I watched the film over again just to help process what had occurred. I was speechless and unable to believe that a movie could engross me so completely. I felt like I knew the characters and as though their pain was mine. I have no idea how the film critics graded this movie so poorly. It makes me wonder how they even get a job as a critic without appearing to have any sound judgment on what it means to be a great film.

359,djove18,"""Remember me"" will make you feel",9,9 September 2010,"I would like to apologize in advance for possible (and probable) grammar and spelling errors in this review (I'm from a non English speaking country and it's not always easy for me to put my feeling into words in a foreign language). I just finished this movie 15 minutes ago and I had to come here and say that I was not only pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie but also I was shocked with the amount of emotions that this movie has made me feel.I'm a 29 year old movie fanatic and a big Twilight fan. I absolutely adore Edward Cullen. I liked the books and (kind of) ""enjoyed"" the movies, but as for my feelings for Edward Cullen....well there's no question about it, I adore the guy, so naturally I really like Robert Pattinson and wanted to see ""Remember me"". Robert is a really good actor with a potential to become a great actor (If you get a chance try to see some of his other movies especially ""How to be"" and you'll know what I mean), and although the Twilight saga did put him ""out there"" it really didn't give him enough room to show his acting abilities....but ""Remember me"" does that. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to separate the teen vampire from Tyler, but Robert does such a great job at portraying this character that after 20-25 minutes of the movie the guy I was watching on the screen had nothing to do with the hot sparkling vegetarian vampire Edward Cullen....all I saw was Tyler. Tyler is a complex and messed up but still very lovable character and casting Robert as Tyler was a great choice. ""Remember me"" is a slow paced movie, and in my opinion that's just how is supposed to be and I wouldn't want it any other way. Dealing with that kind of lost and that many regrets takes time. And it gets worst before it gets better. Tyler is reaching out for help and understanding in all the wrong (and yet in all the right) ways....(don't know if that makes any sense for you guys but that's just the way I saw it). He's angry and lost but the one person he really needs and wants for him to be there is the very same person who he just can't seem to connect with. His relationship with his father is flawed and heartbreaking and it does much to define Tyler's character (aren't we all at least a little bit defined by who and what are parents are and how they raised us?). But even with all the flaws and fights and misunderstanding between these two, in the end you can feel that they do love each other even if they don't like each other that much. The romance part was a good, and there are some really sweet and hot moments, but the connection between Ally and Tyler wasn't shown as deep as I would have liked. Aside from the obvious attraction and ""silent"" understanding I kind of wished that there was more conversation about their pasts and the demons that are haunting them. They have the capacity to understand each others lost most than anyone but they never really discussed it (at least not in so many words). That's why I didn't give this movie a 10 star rating. Tyler's relationship with his younger sister is amazing. Caroline is one of those girls that are too mature and too smart for there own age and as a result of that she's not accepted by her peers. The connection between Tyler and Caroline will make you wish you have a brother like him. The level of protectiveness he has toward his sister is heart warming, it will make you cry. He just adores her. Personally, I think that's the best part of the movie.As far as the ending goes....well lets just say that I didn't see it coming. At the beginning of the movie I was curious about the time frame of the movie, and then just before the ""office scene"", it just clicked....and then of course I cried.I highly recommend this movie. It doesn't matter if you like or hate Twilight because this has nothing to do with Twilight.

They have such depth and the audience is able to identify with them that the ending comes as a saddening, but yet enlightening experience. As I remember one of the crew saying, everyone is still going to move on.Pattinson really impresses me with the depth he brings to Tyler, a 21- year old who is torn with himself. He expresses himself well and is definitely one of the best parts of the movie.The ending was spoiled for me (as it likely was for most people going to watch the movie sometime after the release date), but it still tears me up when it happens.

363,ksanford17,Remember Me,9,24 January 2011,"I rented this movie expecting to watch a decent movie that would keep me entertained, but I got so much more. The movie starts with an innocent scene of a mother and her daughter waiting for the subway. There's two other men several yards away. The scene ends with the mother dead on the concrete and the daughters screams echoing helplessly. Right away, that grabbed my attention. The movie flashes forward to the New York in the Summer of 2001. We're introduced to Tyler, and right away you get the idea that he's a trouble maker, a cigarette dangling from his mouth and a slummy apartment that he lives in. The movie is all about relationships and how people affect our lives in both positive and negative ways.Robert Pattinson did a stunning job of playing the character Tyler. Many people dislike him for his performance in Twilight, but he really delivers. In a scene where he comes to his sisters school and throws a fire extinguisher through the window, the anger really resonated with me. I could feel myself getting wrapped up in his character, feeling his pain. Emilie de Ravin did an extraordinary job as well, playing Tyler's love interest. They both acted in a natural way so every scene was very believable. The way the director, Allen Coulter, shot the movie was very powerful, leaving subtle hints all the way up to the end so that in the last minutes of the movie everything clicked into place. The movie doesn't have a happy ending in the typical sense of the word, but it didn't end in complete tragedy. You were left with a sense of how the characters grew to love and care for each other throughout the movie so that they became closer, the broken family from the beginning now reunited. The movie also hit home for many Americans who have stories similar because of the tragic happenings of Septemer 11, 2001. *SPOILER* Tyler ends up waiting in his father's office in the top floor of the World Trade Center. The scenes afterward are silent and very powerful, of cars stopping, and people's horrified stares as they witness pure tragedy.This movie reminded me of Donnie Darko in a way because the movie ended in a sort of twist, with the main character dying leaving friends and family behind. Other than that the movie felt truly original to me in that I couldn't compare it to anything else. It was very powerful as well as well acted and directed.

366,darianess,Pointless and convoluted writing,3,4 October 2010,"""Remember Me"" is a film that suffers from convoluted writing and unnecessary plot devices. It wastes time on the back stories of supporting characters, that in the end, offer no meaning or significance to the overall theme of the film.The film begins at a subway station in Brooklyn, 1991, where we see Emilie de Ravin's character, Ally (aged 11), and her mother, attacked by thieving hoodlums. With the stolen money and jewellery, the thieves quickly get on the train, leaving Ally and her mother on the subway platform. The thieves are almost on their way to freedom, the train is about to take off at any second, when for no apparent reason, one of the gang decides to shoot and kill Ally's mother. If they were worried that she might remember their faces and report them to the police, perhaps they should have also worried about other passengers or subway staff that may have witnessed a far worse crime than robbing a woman of her purse. We are left to consider this scene and how it fits in with the rest of the story, as it flashes forward ten years, to find Ally, who since her mother's death, has been raised alone by her father, a New York City police officer. The story switches its focus to Robert Pattinson's character, Tyler, a depressed and nihilistic 21 year old who has a poor relationship with his father. Tyler also appears to be struggling to deal with his grief resulting from his older brother's suicide. Tyler and Ally's character's are able to cross paths when Ally's father, Neil, arrests Tyler and his friend after becoming involved in a fight outside a bar. Tyler's friend suggests getting back at Neil by dating and then dumping his daughter, Ally, who he discovers goes to the same college as them. Tyler reluctantly agrees to meet with Ally, she exceeds his expectations and they forge a strong bond, sharing stories about their loss and grief. Considering, the rest of the film becomes focused on Tyler, his past traumas, and his difficult relationship with his father, and also becomes somewhat of a romance between Tyler and Ally, the opening sequence seems rather pointless, as well as misleading. The way the scene unfolds, we are led to believe that Ally's character plays a more significant role, perhaps that she is even the protagonist of the film. We are also led to believe it provides a back story to something extremely important to the development of Ally's character. The death of Ally's mother is not really mentioned again, other than as a confession from Ally early on in her relationship with Tyler. And it is also feebly expressed through her fear of catching the subway, and her desire to eat her dessert before dinner for fear she might miss out on the fun in life (ugh, seriously?). We do not seem to gain any considerable insight into the affect her mother's murder had on the character. Nor does it seem relevant to the rest of the plot. Ally becomes more of a secondary character and one that is simply there to take Tyler to an emotional place.If they hadn't mislead and confused the viewer by allowing the story's protagonist to change from scene to scene, perhaps, the character of Tyler could have been fleshed out some more. Perhaps we could have seen and heard more about the strain in his relationship with his father. The viewer does not hear much detail about the emotional distance between Tyler and his father. We only seem to gain superficial insight from Tyler's reaction to his father's nonchalance and absence from his 12 year old sister's life. Perhaps, there also would have been time to further explore the impact Tyler's brother's suicide had on his life. And perhaps, Ally's back story regarding her mother's murder would have been more powerful had it simply unfolded through descriptive dialogue with Tyler, and not just shown visually at the beginning of the film and then blurted out casually and hastily in a scene or two. It could have really shown a more meaningful development in the bond between the two characters.I will not go into the story further or discuss the ending of the film. However, I will simply say that the story seems to be haphazardly put together and as a result, ends up not really communicating anything to the viewer at all. At particular moments in the movie, I found myself asking, ""why would this happen?"" and ""what's the point?"" I can see what type of film, ""Remember Me"" is trying to be, but it fails in the story's execution. There are far better movies out there in this genre type. I suggest looking elsewhere instead of watching this film.",Remember Me

The acting was at a very high standard, i never really liked Robert Pattinson in Twilight but i guess that could be because i don't really like Twilight. But he really proved himself as a credible actor. Oh and the romance scenes they were very intense and VERY believable, i think Robert and Emilie had strong chemistry which brought the whole film together. Also actor who played Caitlyn in the film did an awesome job and it just wouldn't be complete without her. And to those who say it was 'depressing', i don't know what you were expecting when you decided to watch a 'Drama/Romance' film. i think this film exceeded all my expectations, it left me speechless - literally - at the end i just sat there for 15 minutes allowing everything to sink in...followed by me bawling my eyes out and just generally being an emotional wreck.All in all, i will definitely be recommending this to my friends and watching it again as this film is most definitely one of my FAVOURITE FILMS OF ALL TIME, and i have been struggling to find a film better than it. 10/10P.S. Another good Drama/Romance film i would recommend to those who enjoyed Remember Me would be 'Dakota Skye'.",Remember Me

I'm not the kind of guy who enjoys many romance films, and I'm definitely not a big fan of Pattinson. However, this movie completely blew my biased opinions of the teen heartthrob actor completely away. He, I must admit, was one of the main reasons I think I enjoyed this movie. His acting skills were proved to me, and hopefully to all those who saw the movie without being Robert fans. His acting controlled my emotions, as it should but rarely does.But, Pattinson wasn't the only good thing about this movie. As a whole, it was extraordinary. The other acting, such as Peirce Brosnan was amazing in this role, as was Emilie de Ravin. The plot, though not completely different than other romance movies, was well written and well directed. The movie's twists and turns were exciting, and (if I may say so, without sounding too soppy) heart touching.I find it hard to believe anybody would watch this movie and walk away thinking they had just wasted two hours of their time. I walked away satisfied that I had decided to see it, and I would definitely recommend this to anybody.",Remember Me

She was so needy in a leachy way rather than a vulnerable way, which is what they (the producers) were trying to portray - you know tough damsel in distress type. I just know she tried but did'nt quite get there. In fact she annoyed the hell out of me. Rob was good though his co star and flat mate,Tate Ellington, was brilliant and so were both the fathers (the lovely Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper). I felt the movie just missed out on capturing that rapturous pain which was what was supposed to lure us in the first place.

376,dun_ever,"Amazing, spectacular, one of a kind",10,1 February 2012,"So I haven't watched this movie until today, more specially about two hours ago. I'm not that big fan of twilight or Robert Pattinson. I feel the books lacked the ability to be relatable and the actor lacked emotions. Maybe that was why I was so set against watching this movie. However, every line of every scene in this entire movie has proved me wrong and ignorantly foolish. It is such a dear shame Robert Pattinson is in the Twilight movie series because I do not feel he fits the role of Edward Cullen, therefore leading him to incompetently play a roll that doesn't suit him in any manner. In contrast, this movie, this masterpiece of art has demeaned the actor of his dignity, back to how I looked at him after his Harry Potter release.I've read numerous reviews from critics about the movie and most of them were horribly negative. And I wonder to myself, why? Why? A good movie is one that can manipulate an audience's emotions, make them feel empathy towards the characters that are so real and so. genuine. leaving them on a roller coaster of feelings(depressed, irritated, frustrated, happy, over the moon) The movie was well played out, the script was nicely written, it was relatable in so many ways, and the acting was remarkably decent. The relationships between a daughter and father, sister and brother, boyfriend and girl, friend and friend, the living and the deceased was so magnificently played out that I felt as if there were invisible stings that tied all the actors and actresses together, entwining them to create a movie so magical and memorable. And most importantly of all, when the movie ends and you walk away from the big movie theater/TV/laptop screen it leaves an impeccable impression on you. It gets you thinking about your own fingerprints that you make among friends and the ominous future. OH, and it's not too awkward with unnecessary sex scenes. It's a great movie to watch among family, boyfriends/girlfriends, friends, etc. Nothing that will make you uncomfortable and squirm in your chair that's more than I can say about 80% of the movies the entertainment industry is releasing these couple of years.",Remember Me

All the cast was well selected for this film, and the chemistry between them all really makes you believe in what the film is about. For any true Robert Pattinson fan this is a must see film, and even if your not you've gotta watch it. The ending really does throw you side ways but that is all I am going to say about the film so not to try and spoil it for others as I cant stand that my self, I just felt that I needed to say something about a film that makes you look at life and appreciate what you have.

What a wonderful performance from all especially Rob, Emilie and Ruby. The colors used adequately reflected the mood without rendering it too gloomy or inappropriately light. The two young men reminded me so much of my 21 year old son and any of his mates, mature intelligent bright young men with their future ahead of them. Ally, strong and mature beyond her 21 years. Ruby so sensitive, fragile and gentle. Both fathers so similar and yet so different. This is a film many people will connect with. Like so many I vividly remember 9/11 (shocking and devastating). This film has done an excellent job at bringing the human side to this travesty subtly and sensitively.",Remember Me

I didn't expect it to be anything like Twilight because there's nothing that can compare to Twilight. I being a love story freak also thought a combination of the two celebrities in a love story would make it awesome and I was totally right. This movie totally went beyond my expectations and surprisingly wasn't completely all about love. I had my husband watch it, who reluctantly watched also thinking it was chick flick love story.

You can't rate it by seeing which scenes were perfect and which had of them had flaws. I'm amazed how this movie is considered to be similar to ''Notebook'', ''Devil wears Prada'', ''P.S. I love you'' or ''A walk to remember''. If you watch this movie and all you see is a love story, than i'm sorry for you. This movie is like ''Mr. Nobody'', ''Lord of War''. Thou it is more alike these two movies than any other, especially any love story, it still is something unique and one of a kind. You can't put it in words, but if you can describe and review the movie as a critic after watching it, than you weren't watching it at all. It's like evaluating your mother, her principles, life guidelines, morality and character after she says that she cares about you. It's just wrong and sad. Yes, episodes where Pattinson was raging, were a bit clumsy and overreacted. There might have been 1-too-many sex scenes, and a few spontaneous/unnecessary anger episodes which some might say, had no reason to appear, but other than that movie was perfect and beautiful.

After meeting Ally, the story isn't just a fairy tale with a predictable ending, although lots of clues are left throughout the film to give the audience a guess...All in all it is now an all time favourite (when it comes to this genre), because as I said, it is just a beautiful film and a pleasure to watch!

There is no back story or reason to even feel for any characters because it was rushed. The movie felt rushed and forced. At the end of the movie I was rooting for Tylers dad since he was the only decent actor and did not appear to be at all the bad guy like how the movie wanted to depict him. I think that Dreamworks should make a public apology. Only reason that this movie did well is the hype around Robert Pattison and Twilight. Directing sucked. Writing sucked.

Of course, if you are a die hard Robert Pattinson fan and that's why you're seeing this, you will have 2 hours of heaven.The story itself is compelling and yes, there is an ending you won't want spoiled before you see it. The other actors are also very good. Ruby Jerins is adorable and convincing and Chris Cooper is always good in whatever he does. Emily de Ravin was another pleasant surprise. Pierce Brosnan's accent needs work, and his character was probably the most stereotypical and predictable, but even his character redeems himself. I personally loved the comic relief that Tyler's roommate provided, which lightened the movie up just enough to not make it entirely full of angst.Will this movie win awards? No, nor should it. However, it is far better than a lot of the commercial nonsense out there that does.

And yes: there are characters of opposite sexes interacting in a way that surely has much to do with what is commonly put into the often inexplicable category 'love'.
But there is so much more about this movie (as treated in the second part of the making of) that makes it so highly recommendable. 'Remember Me' shows a glimpse of the many ways people evolve to deal with pain, to cope with the painful void that opens like an endless seeming black hole when we're losing someone, no matter at which stage of life and no matter the kind of relationship to that someone. The movie also treats the painful lesions that the world or our conspecifics eventually confront us with, possible at any time in any circumstances and due to any reason or non-reason. And it treats some of the manifold ways to get through these dreadful experiences. So, the love story is only part of a much more complex picture that is given in this beautiful and tragically realistic movie. Love is here the fulfillment of the unknown and unanticipated search for a soulmate and the sudden, comforting, and therefore highly sparkling, almost explosive, encounter with them once unexpectedly met, as if appeared out of nowhere and still as if linked to by preassigned destiny.
And, by the way, the chosen actors do not only fit together, but they all perform in a highly believable manner, more than one of them proving themselves and their skills allocated far away from cliché.
