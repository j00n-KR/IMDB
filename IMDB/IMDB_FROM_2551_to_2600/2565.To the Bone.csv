0,phd_travel,Well balanced treatment of an eating disorder with humor and drama,9,15 July 2017,"Eating disorders have been shown in many TV movies before but this is probably one of the best on screen treatments of the subject. Movies like this can be painful to watch and not because the subject is painful but because they are often clichéd and not handled well. This movie is actually very watchable.The A list cast deserves special mention. Lily Collins shows she can do drama as well as romantic comedy. She lost weight for the role. I wish these actors and actresses wouldn't do this to their bodies it can't be good for them. Although they have won awards, I think Matthew and Matt never recovered without some damage their looks from their weight loss roles. Nevertheless Lily was quite moving. Supporting cast is good. Tony winning British actor Alex Sharp does a charming and witty fellow sufferer love interest quite well. Lily Taylor as her rather unhelpful but well meaning mother is a good actress but a strange choice - how could she have such a drop dead gorgeous daughter? Keanu Reeves - ever since that rom com with Diane Keaton it seems okay to cast him as a doctor. The dude speak is kind of hilarious. The story has a good balance of humor and drama with well written dialog. Liked the date in the Chinese restaurant. The family therapy session was quite funny too. Also the part about the Holocaust Museum. The characters are interesting and not clichéd. Liked the fact that she got along with her stepmother who cared for her more than her father. Her rapport with the love interest is quite refreshing - not clichéd. Worth watching",To the Bone
1,Hellmant,"Deals with a serious health issue, that I don't fully understand, but I still can relate to it.",8,8 November 2017,"'TO THE BONE': Four Stars (Out of Five) The new drama released by Netflix, through their streaming site, about a woman battling anorexia. It stars Lily Collins, Keanu Reeves, Alex Sharp, Carrie Preston, Lili Taylor and Liana Liberato. The film was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Marti Noxon, and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a well made, and pretty involving film as well.Ellen (Collins) is a 20-year-old suffering from severe anorexia. She's also an aspiring artist, and a college dropout, who has failed to make any progress (with her severe illness) at the recent inpatient program she attended. Ellen moves back in with her stepmother Susan (Preston), her younger half-sister Kelly (Liberato), and a father who's never home. Susan insists that Ellen sees a specialist, named Dr. William Beckham (Reeves), and that she joins his inpatient program. Ellen reluctantly agrees to her stepmother's plan, after Kelly convinces her to do so. Once there she meets a very unique group of people, with similar health issues, that she also slowly bonds with.The movie is disturbing. It deals with a serious health issue, that I don't fully understand, but I still can relate to it. So I also found the characters to be very relatable too, because of this, and despite their obvious flaws, I also found them to be likable and inspiring (in some ways) as well. Collins gives a great performance in the lead, and I think Noxon proves herself to be a talented filmmaker to watch for. I wanted just a little bit more from the film's climax, but it's still a somewhat moving and important movie in my opinion.",To the Bone
2,FeastMode,my notes,1,24 July 2019,"Interesting topic. but not my kind of movie at all. it's not bad, i just hate it and could barely get through it, even with watching most of the movie on fast speed. i watched this almost completely blind, the only thing i knew of the movie was the chris stuckmann youtube thumbnail which was a picture of the girl all skinny and zomblie-like. made me think it was a horror movie lol smh (1 viewing)",To the Bone
3,851222,Not bad movie,7,1 October 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""To the Bone"" (2017) is a pretty good movie that deals with people suffering from anorexia. Yet it doesn't go very deep on that subject matter, and that is pretty shame. Acting was good by all involved, and although Keanu Reeves does not remind of doctor by any means in here, he is always a joy simply watch - he that screen presence. Overall, ""To the Bone"" is a pretty good drama which at running time 1 h 40 min drags here and there but its a pretty involving movie to recommend it to see it on some boring evening.",To the Bone
4,Reno-Rangan,To whom 'Bon Appetit' is a sin!,6,24 January 2018,"Another writer, producer turned director. It was her first feature film and she was not bad. The Netflix producing lots of formats like shows, stand-ups, but I'm more interested in in films which they haven't tapped that greatly, yet. I've seen almost all of their films, and I'm quite happy, but in a few occasions, disappointed. This is surely not a disappointment, yet a slight let down.No doubt that it is a wonderful story with a wonderful cast. But did they narrated it properly! I think somewhere, something's not right. One of thing were the sentiments, that made me like it. Otherwise, I would have considered it a below average.A girl with anorexia is further failing to see any success. Her family is so worried, particularly her half sister and stepmother. Could be the family history that affected her to she end up like that. So it explored all sides, giving reasons. With a new programme beginning, a new hope was expected and how this time she ends were revealed with an emotional conclusion.A film with a story like this should have been an Oscar product, especially to see Lily Collins getting the best actress nod. Because her dedication was awesome. But sad to see it got wasted, I mean not being awards' favourite flick. She said it was a very personal film for her. But I thing for me as well for the same reason of hers.A good title, a good poster. Everybody performed well, besides Collins. I know still majority would love it or already loved it, but there are a few like me not that satisfied. Though I won't say it is completely a bad film. That does not stop me from suggesting it to others. Forget the guys like me, as the days to come, I hope it gets its due. Even I to change my stance!6/10",To the Bone
5,Floated2,Serious realistic drama,7,4 October 2019,To the Bone is a Netflix film about seemingly a serious illness in eating disorders. This film is quite well acted by lead Lily Collins as she carries the film. The subject matter and storyline is quite predictable but realistic in tone. Somewhat resembling other films such as Side Effects and It's Kind of a Funny Story.To the Bone is at times a touch watch but sends a strong and serious message. At times it shifts tones from serious and drama to more light hearted comedy but in the end does a well job.,To the Bone
6,jtindahouse,"Powerful, funny and heartbreakingly realistic",9,24 December 2018,"'To the Bone' is a film that if you don't prepare for it properly can take you quite off guard and hit you hard. I've never known (at least to my knowledge) anyone in real life who has suffered from an eating disorder, so to see it portrayed so astutely and brutally on screen really caught me on the hop. How a film can be made so realistically and also be made with such high quality in every other aspect is quite unbelievable. This is an incredible film that deserves a lot more recognition than it is seemingly getting.I expected the film to be more focused on the unconventional doctor and his miraculous ways of ultimately healing the lead character. Instead he actually has very little screen time and what he does have holds little impact on the outcome of the story. Instead the film focuses more on the fact that you need to heal yourself and that the buck ultimately stops with you.The acting in the film is incredible. Lily Collins in the lead role blew me away. The commitment she showed to the role was one thing, but man can she act her butt off too. The chemistry she and Alex Sharp found was of the highest quality. Keanu Reeves, while in a very different type of performance, also played a key role. He was an immensely reassuring presence to have on screen and his humour worked perfectly for the film.'To the Bone' finds a perfect balance between drama, comedy (this film is seriously funny at times), inspiration and heart-break. It is masterfully put together and the finished product isn't far short of a masterpiece. Exquisite dialogue is just the icing on the cake. I can't recommend this film highly enough. Please see it, you'll be stoked you did.",To the Bone
7,ks-60500,Vivid real,7,15 August 2020,"It's educational of this film but not in a serous or boring way. The makeup and body figure so scary and really make me uncomfortable. It's foreseeable on the storyline but it's just touching and let me know ""you are not alone, life is beautiful"".",To the Bone
8,valleyjohn,Coulod have been edgier but a good film anyway.,7,13 April 2018,"As far as i am aware I have never knowingly met anyone who suffers from Anorexia Nervosa . The only reference that springs to mind is a Louis Theroux documentary i recently watched called Talking to Anorexia where he followed a group of patients in North London clinic. The main thing that struck me about all the girls he interviewed is that it was unlikely that they were ever going to lead a normal life again and most would never get better . To The Bone highlights this well.This is the story of Ellen , a young anorexic who has spent the better part of her teenage years being shepherded through various recovery programs, only to find herself several pounds lighter every time. Determined to find a solution, her dysfunctional family agrees to send her to a group home for youths who are also suffering with their own problems.This isn't the most hard hitting of films considering the subject matter. For the most part , the story is told in a light hearted manner and with humour. Lily Collins is extremely good in the lead roll and the fact that she had to lose so much weight to play the part is impressive. British actor, Alex Sharp is also very good as the love interest but there is a dark side to this movie. No , not the mental illness that Ellen is suffering but the fact that they cast "" Mr Wooden"" Keanu Reeves in the roll as the doctor. It's one of the worst bit's of miss casting I've seen in a while. 
Overall it's not a bad film I just feel at times it could have been a little more edgier.",To the Bone
9,fmwongmd,Dire,6,15 July 2020,A telling portrayal of the terrible toll taken by eating disorders and difficult it is to treat them.,To the Bone
10,juanmuscle,I got a chance to watch this on Netflix,10,9 October 2018,"They were promoting on the bigger blob thing on there, so I checked it out on here first , that is IMDB, and some creep left a horrible review but I decided regardless to go with it, and golly what can I say, it was a delightful. I am very happy to see Keanu doing somethings like this, he was cool! Too bad he couldn't just give the patients a pill to see how good life could be and if you take the other pill you see how bad life can be like dead. Well I thought the characters were neat, wish it was a little bit longer to experience them more, I could see this being a show, I really could and I think it would be cool! After I watched it, I checked the writer/director of this gem on here and it turns out she has created a lot of TV shows, so perhaps this might? or could have been cause all the tools are there, interesting characters, great writing, and nice acting... The story line is not something you get very often which is nice, get to experience something new and learn. It definitely would have been really nice to see how her and everyone's life turned out. But what we got was good , it was like taking a bite from a really awesome cookie crunch bar thing and it tastes the best ever of anything but only getting one bite, kinda wishing I could eat the whole thing! lol... great film.",To the Bone
11,Alexander_Blanchett,The rise of Lily Collins,8,5 August 2017,"Good film. Very important topic which was realistically portrayed and performed. Lily Collins is slowly turning into a very good and charismatic actress. This marks by far her finest performance to date and makes me hungry (no pun intended) for more of her work in the future. It was a performance that reminded me on Rooney Mara and I guess that is a big compliment. Also Lili Taylor turns into a fantastic small performance. She rally needs to work more again! Terrific and scene stealing moments. Keanu Reeves also has some good moments in his short role. Ales Sharp gives the best male performance here. Also touching and emotional character. This is what the film mostly lives for, its characters and because you care for them from the first to the last minute. I also loved how they were able to bring great comedy elements to a very dramatic and serious topic - and effectively so. It worked and did not ridicule the topic. Also the choice of soundtrack was excellent and the film had some really great shots, so I applaud the cinematography as well.",To the Bone
12,SquigglyCrunch,A Fantastic Lead Performance Weighed Down by Poop,2,25 July 2017,"To The Bone follows a young woman with anorexia who decides to join a support home where an unconventional doctor attempts to heal her and others. Lily Collins shows herself to be quite the actress in this movie. She brings a lot to her character, and you can tell that there's a huge amount of depth to her just by the subtleties of her performance and the way she delivers her lines. Not only that, but she literally starved herself for the role. Now that's dedication, especially for a Netflix movie. Also, the disorder itself is pretty well portrayed. All the characters' little things they do to ensure that they stay thin and the way they talk about it is all very interesting. Being a psychology person myself, I found a lot of enjoyment out of that. Sadly, the rest of the movie is awful. For the first half of the movie, Keanu Reeves (who plays the doctor) is constantly out of breath, which is really distracting. It's like the guy's been running laps between each scene he's in, and even when he gets over that he's still not a good actor. There's a reason he doesn't do drama, it's because he can't. The characters themselves have pretty good chemistry, and there is a strong sense of community among them, but individually they're all pretty uninteresting. The character of Luke is a standout in that he's just the worst. He's British and he's super outgoing. Sure, that sounds like fun, but he's outgoing to the point where it's unrealistic. There's a scene where he interrupts someone just to break out into song. And that's it. He just starts singing. There's no reason for it, it has no relevance. He sings the same line later too. But it's not like it supposed to be as a joke either, because he's actually a good singer. So it ends up being this completely out-of-place, awkward scene that does nothing. Despite how well written Collins' character is, everyone else is awful. Their dialogue is uninteresting and often cringe-inducing. None of them seem real in the slightest. Despite the fact that I can tell that the movie is trying to be unconventional in it's storytelling, it really doesn't work. The way it's shot, the music, the way the music is used, everything is horribly conventional. There's nothing special about how this movie is made. There were a couple of defining scenes that really forced this movie down a couple rungs. The first of which takes place in a room where rain falls. It's a scene where a generic song plays over top of it and the song sings about what is going on in the scene. Considering how out of place the scene is, I expect that it was built completely around the song. The second scene is an 'emotional' scene between the main character and her mother. Considering there's no development of their relationship to begin with, it was hard to not only enjoy and embrace the impact of the scene, but it was hard not to laugh. It was so absurd, and I'm sure that if the characters had an on screen relationship it could've worked, but without that it was comedy gold. It was like an SNL skit or something. The third of which was some stupid Inception-ish stuff, where Collins' character has a dream within a dream. She dreams that she dreams about her future. I don't know why she couldn't just dream about her future instead. Would've made it less confusing. Overall To The Bone is awful. There's so much terrible stuff in this movie, and yet somehow I still find myself torn between recommending it and not. Lily Collins is fantastic, and the disorder itself is well portrayed, but the rest of the movie is putrid trash. If you're still interested in it, I'd watch it simply for Collins' performance. In the end, however, I don't think I would recommend this movie.",To the Bone
13,mike-c-b,Everyone's a gleeful egomaniac,1,7 May 2019,"All the characters, apart from Keanu Reaves, are shallow infighting egomaniacs.The mother is so insensitive she offers her daughter with anorexia a cake in the shape of a hamburger... the correct reaction is to internally scream that your family doesn't understand you and just wants to hurt you more and more... the actual reaction in the film was a gleeful shrug... typical of 5c gleeful family sitcom infighting.Not too far from Modern Family but with an ""anorexia twist""... as if they're going for the most offensive portrayal possible.",To the Bone
14,mr_bickle_the_pickle,An Important subject matter that is handled with care,7,24 July 2017,"Eating Disorders is a tough subject and you can tell that this subject matter is handled with care in this movie. It doesn't try and glamourize the lifestyle. And writer/director Marti Noxon doesn't shy away from showing you all aspects of what an eating disorder is. Don't expect a Disney channel episode where a girl gets told shes fat by some mean girl. Barely eats for a week. Has one fainting spell and then gets told how beautiful she is and doesn't have to change and everything is rainbow and sunshine again. No, this film actually and more accurately gives you a depiction of how much of a COMPULSION this is. And not even out of a desire to look skinny, but out of a need to have control. Or as a way to numb their feelings. And Marti also goes out of her way to show all these different aspects of eating disorders. I think a lot of people just think its as simple as just not eating food. They don't know think about the constant working out, the calorie counting, hiding barf etc. Lily Collin's character Ellen, puts her hand around her arm several times to make sure its not getting too big. Just little things like that are sprinkled in. And I also appreciated that there was a male patient receiving treatment. You don't see stories of eating disorders with a male perspective too often in media.One of the things I didn't care for though was the love story. Not only did I not think it was an important aspect for a story about a young woman's journey into getting better. But he was so pushy. I felt their whole relationship was kind of toxic. And in a way, that makes a bit of sense. He is also in recovery and without knowing if he'll be able to go back to dancing, that he would latch onto something else so quickly. He was in a way using her as a crutch, but it never gets properly addressed. And while I understand and agree with some of the doctors methods, I also was quite frustrated with him most of time. Like there's a scene where they are a family therapy session. And it goes off the rails because the parents start to argue over crap that has nothing to do with Ellen. And the doctor later admits to Ellen what a mess it was. But I was sitting there like, why did he let them bicker in the first place then? Overall though it was a well made film and I did get teary eyed a few times. The acting was quite good, but nothing stood out to me in particular.",To the Bone
15,L_Copa,Good but not shocking enough,7,24 April 2020,"Lily Collins is a great actor and she gave more than enough for this role. She truly transformed her body and mind to show us how anorexia, depression and other mental illnesses , affect us. I believe she succeed, just not shockingly enough. I wanted it to be a little bit more extreme, darker, more dramatic. To deliver a powerful message while looking at both sides.. Keanu Reeves was a great addition to the casting. Made the movie viewer friendly and entertaining as always. Totally recommended.",To the Bone
16,nkishudak,This movie needs more attention,10,4 August 2020,"And many reviewers here needs education. The movie is not about anorexia. Doctor B treats young people with eating disorders. The background of any types of eating disorders is mental and starts in childhood. This movie is focusing on the personal backgrounds, not the nature of their disorders. You must understand this and look at this movie that way. As a professional clinical nutritionist I must say; it is a very raw and true to the real problems. Especially when they talk about the magazines, than you hear more about social media and what happened to her follower,etc.
a realistic, great movie.
If you look at this movie in details you'll see:
90% female characters, the only male ones are Dr B and Lucas. We never see Ellen's farther. He is always absent. That relationship has a huge impact on her relationship with men.They barely talk about their relationship with foods. Very important to listen how many times she says; I don't even know why am I doing this. All psychological issues aren't visible by the person who's suffering from them.I could write many other things, but the point is to look at this film this way. I wish more young people would watch it.",To the Bone
17,ReganRebecca,Mediocre,6,15 July 2017,"Even before it was released to general audiences the think pieces started coming out about Marti Noxon's directorial debut To the Bone. So many think pieces argued over whether the movie had a right to exist and the potential triggers it might have for anyone currently suffering through an eating disorder (and warning, despite Noxon's claim that she was careful not to include anything that might trigger someone with an eating disorder the film does have a few moments that feel gratuitous). Unfortunately, on every level, it's just not a very good film. Lily Collins plays Ellen, a 20 year old wise-cracking artist with a dark sense of humour who happens to be anorexic. We first meet her as she is coming out of her latest inpatient program weighing even less than she did when she came in. Appalled, Ellen's stepmother pulls some strings and manages to get her to see Dr. Beckham whose unconventional methods are supposed to cure Ellen. He insists on yet another inpatient program which Ellen initially tries to resist, only to succumb when her younger sister pleads with her to go. The problem is this movie isn't as interesting as it thinks it is. Anorexia is a serious subject worthy of study in fiction and in film, but even though writer/director Noxon and star Lily Collins are both in recovery from the disease their approach feels as clichéd as your average TV movie. Everything from the way that Ellen wears layered dark clothes and makes sarcastic ""witty"" comments that are supposed to show how great she is and wise beyond her years, to the fact that Beckham's unconventional methods seem to be the pretty conventional method of showing off things of beauty, engaging in therapy and not talking down to his patient are incredibly cringe worthy. The frustrating thing is that there are some interesting moments in the film, like how the supposedly happy go lucky model recovery patient Luke turns out to have a bit of a dark side, but even this is barely covered. Collins is great and rises far above the material, but it's unfortunate that this passion project, which does take a couple of interesting turns, seems more committed to staying with the paint by numbers typical approach than in offering us anything truly unusual.",To the Bone
18,mycannonball,Decent but could have had more depth,6,24 April 2018,"This was a decent film and I think it's a very difficult subject matter to try to cover in a 90 minute film. I think that any one person's experience with an eating disorder (or addiction or mental health issue) is unique to that one person. That said, I felt like the film lacked depth in that the characters mostly all felt like stereotypical walking diagnoses. I find psychology very interesting and I consider myself a very compassionate person, but it was hard to muster sympathy for the characters at times. Their eating disorders were almost presented as phases of being a bratty millennial, which is not how I view eating disorders at all. Now here's the weird thing. I don't think that was the filmmaker's intention at all. I think this was meant to be a deep exploration of the issue.Ultimately, the movie felt short for me in characterization and the pacing was a bit slow, but I did still find it interesting in that it's a story that isn't always told and it's always nice to see different points of views on mental health subjects. I think it's a brave subject matter to tackle and I commend the filmmakers for that. I wish I could give it higher than a 6.",To the Bone
19,barbagvido,One of the most gut-puching and depressing movies of the year,8,12 December 2017,"To the Bone is a movie about this anorexic young woman played by Lily Collins and her struggles to get through her eating disorder in this home for rehab. On trailers it even looked a bit sweet and hopeful, but as expected from its subject, this is one sad, sad movie.First of all, the acting is great. Lily Collins is better than ever, she kills this role. Everyone did a great job, but she just carries this movie so strongly. The direction is okay. Not remarkable, but okay. Script has some really nice stuff, but the plot itself is a bit problematic because at some point it jusr stops and doesn't really go anywhere for a while. That killed this movie a bit for me. The emotion is there, but it gets a little sleazy so I ended up really wanting it to end, but partly because it was such a torture in a good way. So, when it comes to translating emotion it worked perfectly (there are especially two heart-wrenching scenes in the third act that will break your heart and might make some cry). I don't know what these experiences usually are like, but I heard ot was brought well.Basically, it can get a bit too slow at times, but other than that it's a really emotional experience. Not a pleasant one, but well done.",To the Bone
20,mochteam,What is the point of this movie?,3,19 July 2017,"Other than Keanu Reeves in this movie I can't see a reason to watch it. It's truly a ""modern"" type of film with the abundance of gay characters and the 20 going on 40 attitudes of the kids in the film along with Keanu Reeves playing the cool Mary Poppins like Doctor.Ah who am I kidding this film is a waste of time. It tries to make Anorexia look like an actual illness instead of the mental disorder that it is. Physically healthy people willing to starve themselves to death because of a mental problem they're having. One even to the point where even starving an unborn child is some sort of comical casual dinner conversation.The movie overall is strange and it didn't make me feel sympathetic for people with the mental issue of eating problems it just made them seem self harming and caring little about the people their activities effect.Can't say that Anorexia a ""1st world problem"" is something that makes an interesting movie subject because this movie wasn't interesting at all.You can make a movie about Cancer, Alcoholism, Drug Abuse, Aids etc. etc. and it can be a pretty impacting and engaging film. The height of this movie is watching people spit up their food and show skin and bones.This movie is exactly the type of modern day movie you'd expect it to be. Making people with a severe mental illness thinking that their problems aren't caused by them and that they're beating something. You beat cancer, you beat alcoholism, you beat drug addiction,heck you beat the flu... you don't beat Anorexia it's not a virus or a drug addiction to overcome it's a mental problem for psychiatrists to dissect and help people suffering from the mental condition find what's causing them to choose anorexia as a way to self punish themselves by literally starving themselves to death.This film is like making a quirky movie about people cut themselves and making it seem like it's some ""trendy disease to beat"" by showing people art and having them change their name.

21,writenamehere,Psychopathic,1,10 June 2020,"The first thing this movie offers is a trigger warning as an attempt to suggest what will follow is true, and sympathetic. While the initial description of symptoms may be close to the truth, the sympathy is not.In classic sadist style, the only reason they use a trigger warning is to attempt to get emotionally closer to the target, so they can stick the knife in with their ""solutions"". This film deliberately sets out to hurt people from a distance, for the sake of not upsetting the politics of small minded voyeurs. Cowardice, of the highest form.If you suffer from this disease, yeah sure, you'll see stuff you might relate to, but you'll have heard it all before, and not in a good way.

The relationship between the sisters was a highlight and acted very well by both roles .Knowing several people with eating disorders ... including a cousin the thought process /inexplicability of the not wanting to eat was really well represented .As many of the other reviews say.. some of the treatment details were a little wacky and unrealistic ..Good to watch .

29,fawn_jane,Touching,6,21 July 2017,"A touching movie about a young girl struggling with life, faced with familiar, crushing, yet mundane issues everyone has to deal with like dysfunctional families, social pressures, actions having unintended consequences, etc.I think too many reviewers here take it too seriously though. It's a movie, you can't really expect it to portray illness exactly the way you think is ""correct"" and ""realistic"".The tagline for the movie is not really accurate... the doctor giving her treatment isn't really a big part of the movie, and the way he treats his patients is not particularly unconventional. I was expecting some Patch Adams stuff but it's was typical Keanu Reeves with his wooden acting. It fit his character, but still, he didn't even appear in the movie that often.The standout performance of the movie though is Alex Sharp as Luke. He should be a Hollywood star, but I guess he's too busy being a Broadway star and winning Tony Awards. He's great, like a young Tim Curry.The movie is engaging enough, but then at the end it just sort of fizzles out, with no great denouement.

30,CutUncut2021,Serious material gets semi-serious treatment,6,24 February 2021,"The very middle-class (self-appointed) adults in this movie like to pride themselves on awareness and self-knowledge (after a lifetime of privileged access to learning), but then freak out when ""kids"" find ways of self-governing and independence, freedom from all the trite platitudes ""It'll be okay"", ""You're gonna make it"" and so on, ad infinitum. The film opens with an alert about ""conditions"" ahead, but fails to warn that all young people face conditions, irrespective of eating disorders. Life itself is a bully, the sod who trips you up, gives you a black eye, spits in your porridge, superglues your locker. Adulthood likewise is a myth, an obfuscation of the failure to mature. Adults don't have the courage to admit ""No, it will not be okay, it will be all uphill."" Real help will be rare in coming, and most times too late. So while independence and self-determination are touted as values for youngsters to seek, it is often the supposed adults that shackle youth's urges to break out. As the then-young singer Cat Stevens so aptly stated: ""From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen."" Tackling a subject that presumably touches the writer/director Marti Noxon from personal experience, the resulting screenplay is hampered by pseudo-romantic distractions (despite the two young actors' immense talents), and not least by the wooden Keanu Reeves (why he's still onscreen is a mystery). Importantly, many reviewers came to this movie with their own experiences of the subject-matter (including distraught mothers), and it is good to read their comments on how it was handled; some were sympathetic, many were outraged. Without doubting Noxon's sincerity, the situation is far worse than she depicts. We look forward to her next outing as director/writer.",To the Bone
31,vesil_vesalier,"Interesting view, powerful message, but...",7,30 October 2018,"This one's tricky.It has beautiful shots, great acting, charming potential. It has humor. It has frightening appearances of semi-well known actors thin as paper to pull off their roles. I'm impressed with Lily Collins' acting. I'm impressed with the message that the movie is trying to pull off.So what's the tricky part, you ask?There is way too much hinted at that never gets resolution. Some of the house-members get nothing for story. Some of their behaviors never get explanation. Expulsions are hinted at, but never resolved.What we have here is that tricky realm of trying to make a movie without beating the audience over the head with a message, and that's just plain hard to do. It's a tightrope walk, and should you veer too far over one side (or the other), you're going down.This is okay if your focus is only on Ellen's story, while you stop caring about the rest of them, but... They bring them too close to Ellen and too close to the nature of what they are trying to combat to simply disregard them later on, which is where you run into trouble with ""message movies"".I always think of the tightrope walk that was Norman Jewison's ...And Justice For All, starring Al Pacino. Talk about being beaten over the head with a message... and yet Jewison still managed to make at least an enjoyable story about it.But it wasn't Rollerball. It didn't have a driving theme throughout the movie that used its message only as backdrop, while it pushed Jonathan E and his quest to find a way to keep playing the game he loved, even while everything and everyone was trying to push him out. There, the message was behind the story, and we still got it.Here, the message drives the story, and that doesn't nearly work as well.I will say this, that it does bring to light a lot about eating disorders and the way the world looks at eating disorders, and there certainly is a lot here that works well at trying to understand how difficult it is to heal from such a thing.I only wish there was a better movie, behind it all.",To the Bone
32,adam-may-bower,"Unlikable, yet Realistic",6,2 June 2018,"'To The Bone' may be a realistic insight into eating disorders, but the film fails to be resonating due to its unlikable characters and overall angsty tone. With both the director Marti Noxon and leading actress Lily Collins struggling with eating disorders themselves, this film definitely had potential to be moving and inspiring. While it was an extremely realistic portrayal of the eating disorder, with credit to a harrowing performance by Lily Collins, this film never really reaches its probable greatness. The majority of the characters in this are unlikable and undeveloped. It feels like the writers based all of their characters off the angsty teenagers of Tumblr, and never really gave their characters any depth. This results in a myriad of cliched and boring characters that you never really get attached to, resulting in the film being quite eye-roll worthy. Despite this negativity, there are still some good aspects of this film such as the brilliant leading performance by Lily Collins, who is very convincing in her role. The climax of this film is quite emotional and somewhat impactful. Although it never reached its potential, it still had tugged on a few heartstrings and brought great awareness to the important issue of eating disorders. However, it never really gave a solution.",To the Bone
33,smetin,Close to the real thing,8,14 July 2017,"When I heard about this movie I was sceptical. I am a male who has suffered from Anorexia since I was 14 (I am 25 now) and have been in 2 inpatient units during this time. I have gone from a weight that literally caused my heart to stop to one that is normal according to society and have recently graduated to become a doctor. To The Bone starts off with an all too familiar look into the life of someone with an eating disorder in an inpatient unit. Once she is 'let loose' into the world she is clearly no where close to recovery. We get some degree of insight into her life struggling with her condition. Lily Collins is perfectly suited to this role given her eating disorder history. I am slightly concerned that this role may have set something off in her mind to trigger a relapse (if not now, then in the future), but as long as she has been able to cope I am more at ease. The attention to detail into her character's daily life is incredible. From being able to recite calories in foods to the countless hours spent doing sit-ups in her room, I was amazed as to how accurate they wanted this movie to be. In my eyes, it was in no way an exaggeration and could be considered an under- representation as to the daily life of someone with an eating disorder.As the story progresses the tone becomes a lot more serious. It makes it quite hard to watch at times, because you do feel concerned for the well being of the main character and her family. It certainly made me emotional at times because it re- surfaced memories of things I put me and my family through. Again, this just highlights how eerily accurate the film portrays the condition. I could literally put names of people I met during recovery to the faces of the characters (patients, doctors, nurses and family members included). Aside from being concerned as to the well being of Lily Collins in this role, the other problem I had going into watching this movie was that it may glamorise eating disorders. However, after the first 10 minutes of watching it I knew this was not the case. It felt a lot more like seeing the world through a real anorexic's eyes. The other obvious problem I had was that this may be potentially 'triggering' for people with eating disorders. I still have this reservation, however I cannot conceive any way a film like this could not have been triggering. Every person experiences an eating disorder differently and have their own personal triggers. Anything in this film could have been triggering for different reasons. What I know is that those without the condition will receive an invaluable insight into the life of someone with an eating disorder. In a world where awareness for such disorders is certainly on the up, many people still think eating disorders are a 'life choice' and that sufferers should just eat. i hope this film makes people realise the daily struggles of sufferers and that it offers sufferers ambition to recover.",To the Bone
34,MaxHaydon1994,Shocking but Necessary,7,18 July 2017,"It would perhaps sound a little cliché to say this film opened my eyes to the affect eating disorders have on people's lives. But it would be 100% true.since watching this film I have seen various articles which spoke about a petition to have the film removed online. Some people obviously feel very strongly that people with eating disorders might be affected in a negative way by this film. However I think it's completely nonsensical to say this film could have a negative impact. It deals with real life issues and show's the very best of humanity and our ability to overcome the worst that life can throw at us.At the core of this film is a beautiful message that will not only strike a cord with anyone who has suffered from an eating disorder. But almost anyone who has suffered from depression or mental health problem.I was already a fan of the Netflix original series and films before watching this particular film. However I'd say the importance of this film and the way in which the film was made has made me so excited for any future projects along the same lines.Despite having nothing bad to say about this film. I will only be rating it 7/10. This is mainly because it's not a film you need to watch twice or certainly in my case. The shock of the film is the main appeal so the first watch and the first watch only that matter. If I had to sell this film to someone in a few words I would say it's shocking...but necessary, a real eye opener and educational to anyone looking to learn about eating disorders",To the Bone
35,ChrisKleinFangirl,Horrible,3,14 January 2018,"Disappointed does not even begin to cover how I felt about To The Bone. Promoting itself as a one-of-a-kind ""made by people with eating disorders"" film, I was excited to see a fictional works regarding anorexia that could still be relate able and quirky to it's intended audience.
 Instead, what I encountered was a surface-scratch of the hardships of anorexia done up as a pretentious whiny teenage rom com.Lily Collins did a great job acting as a rebellious, eyeliner wearing, smoking, tumblr user, theirs no denying she is a great actress who we hope to see more from, but the filmmakers did no favours at all by making possibly the worst stereotype possible, not only is it harmful, it's also incredibly lazy, their was virtually no character development for the protagonist.
 But the worst part was Ellen entering the inpatient unit, I don't know what fantasyland the filmmakers got their facts from but damn, I dare anyone to find somewhere like this. For a start, each patient has a different disorder, Kendra is an overweight binge eater (also black and a lesbian, just to tick those boxes), Pearl is an anorexic ""tubed"" patient, Theirs also a pregnant bulimic (also jewish just to tick that box) , But the worst character in this whole shambles is Luke. I don't know what purpose this irritating, unrealistic , toe-curling cringey boy serves to the plot, yet for some unknown reason he gets alot of screen time. We don't learn alot about the mysterious Luke, is he gay? is he bi? why does he insist of everybody else eating? why is he such a knob to everyone? does he even have an eating disorder? But knowing he's a male ballet-dancer from London just ticks more boxes I guess.
 Throughout her stay in the hospital, she dosen't get better but Dr.Hippyshit Reeves encourages her to change her name to ""Eli"" which is supposedly supposed to serve some significance to the plot. Later on he takes the ""rexies"" (dont get me started on that one) to an art installment and tells them all that life is beautiful *cue montage of english guy ballet dancing in the faux rain* . How nice, I'm sure that would make a great difference to an anorexics life.
 Shortly after he tells the patients to say ""fuck you"" to all the voices in their head. Wow, real groundbreaking stuff. It is implied earlier in the movie that he has a long waiting list of families desperate for his help, who knew faux rain could make such a difference, hey?
 None of the patients get any better, the bulimic girl loses her baby, another is storing sick under her bed and using laxatives and Ellen, sorry, Eli is thinner than ever, she decides to run away to her mothers house (also a lesbian, also i-polar tick tick) After some weird flashing back and forward between heaven scenes, Eli ends up going back to the unit.
Nothing in this film happens for any reason, It's unrealistic, poorly acted and full of lot holes. Nothing was ever said about the realities of living with an eating disorder, just lots of jokes ie;""suck my skinny balls"" and even Eli laughing about spitting food out. I could rant and ramble about this forever, but the bottom line is. This is not anorexia, this is a hipster artsy joke.Some interesting points where raised here but go and watch a documentary or read a book or something, save this for 14year old tumblr users",To the Bone

38,TreasureHunterGirl,"Failed to get ""to the bone""",5,13 May 2019,"This was a strange movie. I'm not sure what was trying to be conveyed. Funnily enough, I watched it because I thought it would be a well told story with some real substance to it and I was sick of the stupid teen romances Netflix kept telling me were dramas. I guess I just can't escape them.
Anyway, the premise of the movie sounded good, and I feel like it was a great opportunity to show the realities of eating disorders. It really didn't take that opportunity. I didn't know a lot about them before watching this and I thought I might learn something. I still don't know much about them though. The warning at the start about some scenes being realistic and intense made me think they weren't going to shy away from all the awful and heartbreaking details of eating disorders. I was wrong again. Instead it just showed all these people suffering from a very severe mental illness as 2D stereotypes.
As for Ellen's journey. What journey? The movie started in the middle of it and finished before a conclusion. I presume getting over an eating disorder would be a long, tough battle. But apparently you just need to go out into the desert and pass out, have a spiritual awakening and decide that everything is going to be fine. If only everything were that easy.
I wouldn't say the acting was bad, but once again Lily Collins has failed to be engaging. I don't know what it is about her. I can't seem to care about or feel for her characters. I don't think it's poor acting, but it could be poor direction which is unfortunate for her.
The only one worth watching was Keanu Reeves though his character didn't really do too much either.
I don't know, I can't put my finger on what exactly was wrong with this movie. It was boring. It's like the filmmakers didn't have a clear vision. What were they trying to say? They had the opportunity to get right ""to the bone""

Here's the hing... This story was done really well. The acting on Lily's behalf was remarkable. 
Eating disorders are a real thing. Bringing any disorder into the line light is a challenge, because it forces us to pay attention to it. As a society full of beautiful people we really do need to be there for each other in times of need, and not to judge. You never know what someone is going through. With that being said, I did like the film. I won't say I enjoyed it due to the subject matter, but it was done very respectively and did give some great insight into the lives of those affected. 
I was with it through til the end, but I couldn't give it more than 7 stars for that exact reason. I need to know how it ended. They left us hanging with so many questions! I desperately wanted to know how things turned out for everyone.

I also read that she lost more than 20 pounds to play the role of the anorexic lead character, Ellen. If this is true, I am more than appalled and outraged. This is a very sensitive topic for many people and I deeply relate having had a mother who suffered from anorexia and ultimately died from complications from the condition.Again, if what I have read is true, with all the special effects make-up available I find it more than appalling that this actress lost over 20 pounds to play this role. Regardless of whether she used a nutritionist (as indicated in several articles) or not, this is more than irresponsible and reprehensible. It would be like giving a recovering alcoholic or drug addict a role and suggest they actually get intoxicated on set.

This movie didn't shy away from reality, it shows the sickness exactly how it is. It doesn't glorify it. The journey is shown to be tough, we don't get an answer as to why Eli is doing what she's doing. Eli's family tells us what it is to watch someone slowly get closer to death, by choice. At the end, the birth mother accepts her death if that really is what she wants. And we get an epiphany, she opens her eyes to see what she has become, who she's pushed away.

Was it glamorised? Not really, but it was made to look a bit like a life choice that wasn't really all that awful, certainly for our smart- talking heroine.There was something terribly detached about it.

In my early twenties I didn't deal with it appropriately only to end up working for a group of wellness clinics... the biggest one for eating disorders. From here onward you can guess I had a massive anorexic/bulimic relapse (in my late 20's), and I went through my companies own in patient unit and several others... In my early 30's I finally made the leap, quit my triggering job and took a year off to heal. I did CBT (group therapy), shrink, psycho therapy, dietitian/nutritionist, etc etc. I am now I'm my mid 30's and I am FINALLY OK with myself, kinder to myself and able to accept myself as I am and enjoy food again. Why did I write this entire cathartic blurb? Because this movie is INCREDIBLY accurate and well made! Now only does it pretty much mirror my own relationship with myself and others, I really identified with the defiant and guarded girl Lily Collins portrayed! I literally broke down in tears at the mother/daughter breastfeeding scene... it made me think of my own issues with my mother and her inability to both breastfeed and connect with me. At my stage of healing I did not find it triggering, but that's not to say that those who are actively struggling with their own wellness might not benefit from watching it. All I can say is that the acting was spot on, as was the the secrecy,tortured, shameful and painful nature of eating disorders... during mine I did it all; starvation, binging, purging, cutting, overdosing, laxatives, diuretics, hiding food/puke/stool, you name it!

YES. is this a great movie? i don't think so. Let's start with the acting. well, i'm going to give me praise to lily collins. this is definitely a better performance from her. It showed how much she actually cares about this character and film. Keanu Reeves' performance is weak and at times forced. other supporting actors are doing a pretty good job. even they didn't really develop well, which brings out my main problem to this movie, development. characters which are far more interesting to know is drawn out, by you can guess it- cheap subplot romance.i do expect a romance from this film when i watched the trailers. but i didn't think it's going to take much time that it drowns out the actual story i'm expecting. the first half of the movie, when the romance doesn't got involved, i'm pretty much in love. it portrays how much our main character is struggling. but after the whole romance got involved, it became unbalanced. those time could be used for actual things to make us feel more about the main character, but it dumbly got drowned out and only slipped by a line or two. i know that too much flashback is a pain, but seeing how this movie focuses on her struggle and journey, could you please at least show us a thing or two that make her struggling? at least, the ending makes it all up, it has some great emotional moments, that scene with her biological mother is somehow works out pretty well.all and all, it's still a decent movie. and by this, i wish there are more movies about the topic.",To the Bone

Not so much because of the realism or dark extents that this film is not afraid to go to, but the acting. This movie made me think more than most movies do and I am not one that has a lot of knowledge on anorexia nervosa. What this movie did do, though, is force me to understand how the main character thinks in regard to food and that is the biggest compliment you can give this type of movie. Keanu Reeves was also a fantastic casting choice for the doctor, and was also really good.There is one scene in particular towards the end which on the surface seems like a risky scene to incorporate into a movie like this, but it paid off tremendously and this ended up being one of the most emotional and moving scenes I have seen this year, and this movie is worth seeing just for that scene.The only downside I can think of to this movie is the writing for some of the supporting characters such as Alex Sharp, which despite his fantastic acting, will be a character that may come across negatively to some people. Another problem I had was how the last few scenes of the movie were handled, but that mostly comes down to opinion and not fact.Overall, this movie is much more moving and emotional than any other movie I have seen this year and deserves all the praise and recognition it can get, despite the fact that this movie will not click for some people.",To the Bone

Keanu is about the best looking doctor I ever saw but he does not overwhelm the cast with his degree of celebrity, although I have often wondered how he magically manages to do that in his smaller roles. This is clearly Lily Collins movie but I will say that Lili Taylor's scenes are very touching and one in particular had me believing and teary which I did not expect. Depending on a given viewers degree of emotional connection to the subject matter there will be fallout. Can't be helped with such a real portrayal of this confusing illness and the exploration of how it happens and how it is overcome. A nice addition to the Keanu Reeves filmography with skillful portrayals from all the actors that are often comedic and isn't that how real life often turns out?",To the Bone

Eating, munching, swallowing all those are normal actions for us to live, but for them it is something close to hell or disgust. However, this movie depicts the patients struggles and pains for dealing with anorexia, so that the viewers can empathize with them. Overall it was a good movie, except for two parts. First is the drawing that the main character has drawn. In the movie they only explain that the drawing she uploaded on Tumblr made a girl cut her wrist and die. But it did show us what really happened. I wanted to see the drawing that lead to this circumstance. What affected the girl to want to commit suicide? The second part is the ending. I could see the main character managed to face her disease, but it did not show us the result. Was she able to overcome anorexia or has she still suffered?

66,angemichelled,If only I had met a doctor more like this. ..,7,17 July 2017,"I wanted to review this movie since it hits close to home. I have battled anorexia since I was 13. I think the movie was good about showing what it is like minus the family stuff. ..obviously that is for each individual. I also did not have my period for a long time and overly exercised even if I saw white spots. The only reason I went to a doctor at 15 is because after a couple years of me ""embarassing"" my mother in front of the church or her teachers at school, people kept asking why she wouldn't do anything (and she cares what strangers think) . She finally took me to a psychologist and lo and behold that lady had anorexia when she was younger and basically gave me death stares. ..& said almost all of the things in the movie that they tell her in the beginning like ""just eat"" , ""your organs are going to fail"", threatening a tube in my nose etc. It was almost like a newly sober person that suddenly despises anyone who uses and needs them to be on their level OR else. That was my experience with that psychologist. And the things I mentioned they tell you. ..That is like telling a smoker not to smoke. If it was that easy, no one would smoke or have anorexia for years. Needless to say, I did not see her for long then I saw a couple people (psychiatrists) after that but never for very long. Anyway, if I had had a doctor that got it more like Keanu or a program like that then maybe I would have gotten better sooner, especially with him not being interested in the family or food talk like most. One thing that did bug me is how many chances she got. .I get some people's families might could do that but kind of not unrealistic for a lot. Anyone who does not have an eating disorder, I do not think this movie glorifies eating disorders. It might stir up OLD feelings, but if you are over it enough, you can be objective and empathetic. Even if you are in the depths of an eating disorder, you are just going to be like yup, yup...that is how it is even though it really does not go too far into the overthinking since it more about the girl's journey. I do not think it would trigger anyone more unless they are younger like 13 to 18 because I use to get more ideas from documentaries, books, and movies about anorexia to be honest.

71,gillionlaura,Is it really reflecting the reality of anorexia?,6,18 February 2020,"I thought the movie was okay, there were some heartfelt elements lacking nevertheless, my main concern with this movie is that it's highly triggering for a lot of people who've had or have eating disorders. I say this as someone who has been dealing with an eating disorder, who watched this film hoping for a realisation but instead got triggered as well as read other people who deal with ED's share the same sentiments as me about this movie. Reason for this is simple, as said before, the movie lacked heartfelt elements and showcased more how someone with body dysmorphia implements twisted ways to lose weight rather than how this person realistically suffers through this & how it deeply impacts their relationships with their loved ones as well as their own physical and mental health. The movie had ""moments"" of these but overall I feel the movie failed at the latter and thus brought the unintended effect of triggering people with a history of ED's.People need to remember that having such an illness causes one to constantly compare themselves to ""thin"" people, eagerly looking at this person's lifestyle and trying to mimic it so that one can look like that person. Thus, for a healthy person watching To The Bone was ""educational"" but for someone with an ED it was unintentionally a source of information on how to implement toxic eating & exercise habits. I feel in future people really need to be more cautious when creating films around ED's and people need to have a more holistic approach when focusing on how having an ED drains every inch of happiness out of you.",To the Bone
72,valentino-peluso,Best Film Netflix Made,9,22 July 2017,"Before this film I had read critics but I decided to give it a chance. I myself have never struggled with eating disorders but several other mental issues that have a connection to the characters in this film as well.This was a very bold film, it's almost like it knew it was going to create mixed feelings but didn't take that into any consideration. That and the fact that some of the actors and behind the scenes workers had previously dealt with eating disorders made this film already a masterpiece. It gave a certain emotion and devotion that could've never been given by an actor trying to guess how it must feel like. Equally as in a film centering transgenders played by actual transgender actors. Lily Collins went from a main stream Hollywood pretty girl, to an independent vulnerable actor. She put herself into this role in many ways and personally I thought it was magnificent. She broke loose from her past and her acting skills are unrecognizably good in this film yet still very natural. Many people criticized how she portrayed this character very typical and almost cliché, I think in this case it's realism. No depressed boy or girl with an eating disorder would be crying all the time, or be overly happy and kind trying to mask things. She is sarcastic, and sort off bad-ass because she doesn't like herself and has no care for life or the world at all. They created a perfect mix to show the impact of mental illnesses and the darkness following, without doing much effort to make people understand how it feels like, I think the people who know can relate to this film in some ways. Yet I didn't see it as very triggering to people with mental illnesses because it wasn't romanticized.

I gave it 5 stars for the honest attempt (the filmmaker's intentions were good). I've worked at an eating disorder non-profit, so I can say things with some authenticity. The one thing I thought was done well in this film was its portrayal of the difficulties in convincing people of the necessity for treatment. And it did portray the issue of the extensive failures of inpatient treatment. IE: it often fails. Films about ED often are sensational...they are always portraying inpatient treatment. And the sufferers are always portrayed as victims, those poor girls who are destroyed by society's obsession with thinness. Frankly, there's more to it than that. And the cast was relatively, monocultural, which is becoming less common each day. And society's neurotic relationship with food and thinness are only one part of the makeup of ED, as well as family issues. Many ED sufferers do not come from broken families. Plus, this is really just a cheesy movie. And Keanu Reeves was a bad choice for this movie. He is the exact opposite of what characterizes a successful provider of ED treatment. Tough love doesn't work generally...I feel like the filmmaker should have taken this into account. But, again, thanks for trying.",To the Bone

I liked Eli's interaction and interest with the other patients in comparison to how she was with the patients in the first clinic. I actually like the fact the focus wasn't on Eli and Luke's relationship developing and instead it was on Eli's journey. The audience got to see her journey until she literally got to breaking point to decide whether or not to live. The best line out of this was basically when the Doctor told her to grow a pair (sounds blunt and insensitive, but that resonated). Well done on a refreshing take on a very serious problem.

My only thing is i think it would have been better in a series, because then you can really get into the disease. Some people complain about the movie being superficial, i think it may be better as i series. But then again, it would be much harder for Lily Collins to play the role, and not get a re-laps herself.

79,faithannholloway,A believable tale of a complex disease,7,30 July 2017,"The story follows a young artist named Ellen (Lily Collins) and her longstanding battle with anorexia. Her dysfunctional family dynamics lead her to live in a group home led by an unconventional young doctor (Keanu Reeves). The people she meets - including a quirky love interest - could be the final push she needs to accept recovering. The film came under a lot of heat during its release with critics claiming that it glamorised eating disorders towards a young, impressionable audience.  Casting Lily Collins as our protagonist could obviously have its repercussions, she is an unquestionable beauty with her high cheekbones and perfectly sculpted brows serving as distractions from her wilted and bruised frame in the film. The rest of the cast is distracting too - each coated with their own quirks and endearments, it's easy to forget that this is really just a house full of sick, dying young people who are suffering from a harrowing habit of self-deprivation.But I believe Noxon had good intentions at heart when she created To The Bone, considering it was based on her own story of recovery. The details of Collins character are impeccable, from the bruises on her spine to her ability to recite calorie numbers by heart. Just like any film based on a controversial subject, audiences will pick and choose what they deem appropriate and that seems to be the case here. Ellen's life-is-actually-good epiphany is so closely entangled with her eating disorder that I can understand the critics perspective. Ellen shows all the common characteristics of overly skinny celebrities or fashion icons; oversized sunglasses, black clothes, kohl eyeliner, smoking cigarettes... For young audiences, this kind of romanticism sugar coats the realities of what really happens to the body during starvation - losing your hair, susceptibility to the cold and becoming infertile. There's no denying that it has some flaws. It's weirdly indulgent at times (a group dance scene in the rain, seriously?) and I still find it slightly jarring to hear Tumblr actually said aloud. Also don't even get me started on the teepee scene (watch and you'll know what I mean).  But even then, it still wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I personally find the criticism a bit overdone. The argument that watching To The Bone would trigger a relapse for recoverers is a tricky one. A quick look at IMDb for 'anorexia films' and 114 titles appear. Its clear audiences have no shortage of disordered eating films to pick from (BINGE by Angela Gulner is a recent favourite of mine). Therefore, this film is inherently no worse than any other film that portrays and arguably glamorizes a disease. With the plethora of gory and dark material on the internet, all a sufferer would need to do is perform a quick Google search to find a muse just like Ellen. Claiming media has such a direct and dramatic effect disregards the complexities of such a disease. It's the same old song and dance from video games right? Not everyone who plays violent video games shows violent behaviour, some do certainly, but it probably is more of a sign of their own susceptibility to violent behaviour than anything else. In summary, To The Bone is far more watchable than its critics would let you believe. It's incredibly funny at times, dry, harrowing and important to get this kind of conversation going. Collins did a fantastic job fully immersing herself into this role and let's face it, it's nice to know Keanu Reeves is still around. You can be the judge for yourself.",To the Bone

The difference between something like this and 13 reasons why, is that I can suspend my disbelief for 13 reasons why, and then feel engaged in character drama. With this movie, even suspending my disbelief, it couldn't make up for awful writing, stereotypical characters, and a plot line that is literally nonexistent. Its like a a D rated version of Girl, Interrupted. And I loved that movie. 6/10 for no plot line, predictable characters, cringe dialogue, damn near grazing over the topic of the movie itself- ANOREXIA, making it seem normal. Its not normal. It literally takes over peoples lives like, every second of the day you're thinking of what you are or didn't eat or how to burn more calories. Ellen/Eli spits her food out and its almost a gag, she does sit ups by her bed and it seems like regular exercise, she runs to a restaurant and once again, it's made into a joke.

There are two characters who suffer from eating disorders who aren't a skinny white girl out of six characters, one of them being a plus sized black woman and the other being a skinny white man. They present Ellen's treatment of pushing her to the brink of death as the only correct way to treat her.

90,con_bus,Terrible recovery model,3,30 August 2018,"The central message of this movie is that people with eating disorders will get better when they decide to get better and that letting them hit ""rock bottom"" will help them get to the point at which they will decide to get better. Lets unpack that. If just wanting a thing badly enough would give people the will power and skills to be able to accomplish their goals, would any of us be over weight, addicted, jobless, or homeless? If hitting rock bottom was a great catalyst for recovery, wouldn't addicts who have been treated with Narcan always recover? They are on death's door, isn't that rock bottom? Wouldn't people who have lost a child to the foster care system always recover? The truth is that hitting rock bottom has nothing to do with gaining the skills needed to recover. It is true that on any curve there is a lowest point before the trajectory starts an upward path, but the depth of the lowest point has no relation to whether the upward trajectory will ultimately be successful. Correlation is not causation. In this review I've typed a lot about addiction recovery, but I also have personal knowledge of eating disorder recovery. The premise in this movie that the parents are unhelpful and should therefore not be included in the recovery process is flawed. If parents and children have trouble relating, a skilled counselor can help train them how to be emotionally supportive of each other. The premise that eating disorder patients should be given the freedom to eat whatever they want is flawed. A person with disordered eating needs to learn to accept a healthy diet by facing and dealing with the emotions that arise from healthy eating. Eating nothing but peanut butter or nothing but vegetables will not help a person face their fears or learn to handle their emotions. Allowing a patient to continue to lose weight because they haven't decided they are ready to eat is flawed because a starving brain is not capable of making good decisions. This recovery center seems to believe that there is a magic number on the scale below which a person's health is in danger of the often fatal effects of starvation. There is no such magic number. Humans are unique and one person may have a stronger heart than another, while a third may have problems with lack of electrolytes from a starvation diet. People as thin as the people in this movie are in medical danger. 10-20% of people with anorexia ultimately die from it. I have seen a teenager who was not nearly as thin as the people in this movie who had a resting heart rate of 39 because her starvation diet did not provide enough calories for heart to beat faster. After she spent one day in the hospital with 3 meals, her heart rate was back up to normal (she still had a long road to recovery learning to eat enough food when not in a hospital with the threat of imminent death looming). I didn't see any examples in the movie of how a teen or young adult could better cope with the societal pressures to be thin and I don't see anything that person with an eating disorder or the loved one of a person with an eating disorder would gain from watching this movie.",To the Bone

98,iavery,Proved me wrong - rather beautiful film.,7,22 July 2017,"I was certainly sceptical about this movie before watching it for the first time. Having personally suffered from anorexia, I anticipated that the new Netflix original would misrepresent what it is truly like to be entrenched in the world of your own eating disorder. I was partially fearful that with the beautiful Lily Collins playing the focal role of Ellen, that the film might romanticise the extremities of such a fatal mental illness and send the wrong kind of messages to the diverse range of Netflix account holders much like '13 reasons why' managed to do. However, having personally worked so hard towards recovery, my main concern with regards to the movie was its potential trigger factor. I was so wary of watching the film because I know how to push my own buttons; I have been on and off battling with disordered eating for long enough to know that if I am having a bad day, or experiencing something totally out of my control, one can be easily influenced to restrict, and over-exercise. I did not want myself and other past sufferers, nor any impressionable viewers, to hop on some totally dysfunctional bandwagon of anorexia's practical 'tips and tricks' into losing a vast amount of weight in a short time frame, then use it to justify some sort of deep routed emotional battle. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised. What won me over was the films focus on the sufferance of anorexia rather than how Ellen became ill or even why. The stigma that society has associated with anorexia in recent years must be abolished, thus I was pleased to not have had to sit through a an hour and 47 minutes of a pretty thin girl looking at prettier and thinner runway models etc. One of the greatest misconceptions of anorexia is that the illness stems from a persons desire to be thin – this is entirely subjective and often incorrect. Each person suffers in a different way, looks different, weighs different, and most importantly, has become ill as a result of a variety of reasons that are usually (and unknowingly) far more deep routed than a 'strive for thinness'. It is for this reason that I saw the film from an empathetic stance rather than an embittered and distasteful one. I was pleased to see that the place of Ellen's treatment housed patients suffering from an array of eating disorders such as bulimia and a binge eating disorder rather than just anorexia; an eating disorder is a mental illness, just because you may weigh more than someone else for example, does not make you as a patient any less sick than the next sufferer: you are allowed to hurt and you are allowed to connect and relate to another character in the film besides Ellen. The casting of a male patient in the home also caused me to sigh with relief: another huge misconception of eating disorders by society today is that this is merely a 'young girls' issue. I adored Luke's character and I think that any viewers who have been through similar traumas would easily warm to a lot of the characters, particularly Dr Beckham's patients. As result of this, I would rate 'To The Bone' as educational, not triggering, but nevertheless emotional (my eyes were leaking throughout the majority of the 107 minute run time). This movie was always going to be difficult for me to watch as I only stopped being treated for my eating disorder less than a year ago. During treatment and even after it I've relapsed several times and my friends and family have always been of great support, but if I had told my Mum I was going to sit down and watch one of the first films that actually focuses on the life of an anorexic girl, by myself, her alarm bells would have rung and she would immediately look for changes in my behaviour – she worries more than any Mother ever needs to as a result of the turmoil I have put her and my family through over the last three years. However, both the casting and characterisation of Ellen's dysfunctional family life, beautifully (and comically) represented the effect anorexia has on the loved ones of the patient and thus I would recommend any individual who has been or is currently affected by someone else's eating disorder to watch this film – it will allow you to empathise with characters such as Ellen's Stepmother, Mother, and half sister, but it might also teach you how to tolerate, comfort and help the individual so close to you that is unfortunately suffering from an eating disorder. Overall, given that this is the first film I have watched where the plot line is centred around the suffering, and effects of an eating disorder, Marti Noxon has touched on all I had hoped him to whilst evoking emotion and simultaneously educating a wide range of viewers.",To the Bone
99,moggsheila,One thing that stood out for me;,8,26 July 2017,"One thing I really admired about this movie was that (from what I recall) they don't ever say exactly how much Eli weighs during the scale scenes, you just see the reaction of herself and the nurse. I like that there was no number, which might spike controversy in people saying that others would try to ""catch up"" to her weight loss.",To the Bone
100,manu_chi,eating disorder treatment fantasy land,4,14 July 2017,"-SPOILERS- don't read if you didn't see it.I was really excited for this film but lets be real... this is a total disrespect to people who work trying to help those with eating disorders. The place were she goes for treatment is a fantasy land; Lets face it.-90% of the time, they are unsupervised, so they can work out, puke or have a mental break down who is handle by the other patients - Patients can eat whatever they want...even NOT eat at all. Everyone knows that this places has always schedule eating menus for every patient needs. The girl overweight with bulimia is only seen eating peanut butter?! Great way to make you healthy. - One patient hides a vomit bag under the bed and no one smells it or the nurses don't find out cause, apparently, no one searches the rooms from time to time. - The mother says: I accept if you wanna die. And this is not discussed on the movie as the worst possible thing to say to a person in the kind of the situation the protagonist is living. -Basically they are there earning points, cause that is the whole reason they eat, not to get better at all...this points allows then to go outside alone and buy laxity's for example. - Of course, and if you want you can just leave without even a call to the parents from the doctors. Cause its just so normal to leave without your doctors consent if you are in a treatment facility.Really the worst movie i ever saw on the subject. The performances are good, but not worth it. And they made a huge marketing about how it was a real portrait of eating disorders. Sorry, but saying the f word to the voice in your head is not enough folks.---- Feels like i needed to give a response since i was being attack on the account that i may not have suffer from ED myself..First of all, the movie portrait both the eating disorder as a whole in a person life as the eating disorder inside the facility environment...so if someone wants to criticize the movie there is no problem in focus in one of those topics. Second, i have never said i worked in a treatment facility at any point of my review. However, if its so important to accepted the critics of others i have no shame in saying that yes, i suffered myself from ED in the past and yes, i was once in a treatment facility and have also watched many documentaries and TV shows on the subject. (since we all know, we can get a bit obssessive.) So, in my opinion, this movie, as unconventional as the doctor my say he is, does not show decent and real work that happen in those kind of places.I can also tell you my opinion on the rest of the story. Does ED people puke, do exercises unhealthily, count calories, have different ages, races and weights? yes. Do they suffer with mental struggles as if they cant control the illness and others? yes.Now...the doctor does ONE session with the family and decides it is pointless? Too unconventional...for me. Freedom of speech, sure! Just don't think they should have made such a marketing saying a lot of people with ED past or ED knowledge were involve in the movie so they could make a work that shows the real deal, and give voice to these people. Cause for me, if a person with ED watch this and thinks there is a place where they can go and eat or not eat at their on decision, do exercises without supervision, go to the bathroom at night alone and puke, not have to deal with family session (wich are hard but so necessary)...so this for me does not help this person at all. No matter how lily Collins face looks all proud ""i got back to treatment because I wanted to"" at the end. For me she is just walking into a toxic treatment all over again.",To the Bone

102,reflectandthink1,"A girl who encounters and deals with the struggle of having anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder.",4,14 July 2017,"I was deeply disturbed while watching this movie. I suffered from severe anorexia nervosa, and I started watching this to see if they are really spreading the message of how horrible this disease is, but I was disappointed to see that this movie does not entirely depict what having an eating disorder is truly like. It is dark and scary. It is about having to be in control of your calories to a obsessive degree. It is when you are so self-conscious and have such a low self-esteem that you have to go to bed starving because if not you will gain weight, get fat,be ugly, and no one will really want you. I was to the bone. It is not glamorous. It is stressful and addictive and unhealthy. You are literally killing yourself, thinking you are become more beautiful while actually you are slowly but surely bringing your body more into starvation mode as your bones protrude sickly. Nothing funny about it. At all. Also, many people going through this don't really know what they are doing to themselves. I didn't. And trust me, it makes it worse if people around you are getting frustrated and judgy of what you are doing- you just end up feeling worse about yourself. You need love and encouragement. This movie doesn't show this truth. If you know someone with an eating disorder, tell them that this is not healthy for their body and that beautiful is strong, healthy, and happy. Tell them they are enough no matter what, that God has a bright future for them, and that they are not alone. That no matter what they see in the mirror, being fit and healthy matters SO much more than looks. And finally, that they are overcomers. They CAN do it. This disease doesn't own them, and they will defeat any doubts about themselves that they encounter. They are SO priceless, strong, and valuable.",To the Bone

I'm hoping for a sequel as many questions were left unanswered.Overall, it was a brilliant movie and I would recommend it :)",To the Bone
104,brierstephanie,"Realistic, emotional",10,21 July 2017,"I started watching the film slightly sceptical, as shows and films based on mental health *cough*13 Reasons why*cough* have a habit of romanticising the illness, despite still being good. To the Bone is the first film I have seen that truly captures eating disorders. It also has a realistic representation of cast, mostly young women, but also a male, and PoCs (which are for some reason pushed aside in most MH films). I believe a film like this had to be made, it shows people suffering with eating disorders the reality of it, and educates people who are oblivious, whilst not being too brutal as to trigger or scare viewers. As a previous long term sufferer of anorexia it hit home to see a film I could relate to so well, all the habits shown and the caloric memory, the feeling that the world was going to end if you took a bite of toast, and how it felt like climbing a mountain, were things I used to do and feel. The fact that a lot of the cast and crew have experience with EDs gives a realistic insight into the consuming, terrible, and deadly world it is.My only complaint is that perhaps the film is not brutal enough, though factual, a lot of the realities are still somewhat softened. EDs are something a lot of people are lacking proper education in just how horrific they are. But I understand the movie was supposed to pull heart strings, not truamatise. Its a truly emotional film, it makes me thankful how far I have come in my recovery and urges me to never fall back. More movies like this need to be made.",To the Bone
105,jjilstew,Mom of an adult child battling anorexia nervosa,4,23 July 2017,"I've been struggling to get through this film as I can see my daughter's pain. But the scene where the mom is bottle feeding her grown daughter is too much! My child never wanted that as a newborn. I had to feed her and lay her in a bouncy seat. My love as a mom was never the thing missing. My daughter still calls me an awesome, loving mother and yet she feels such pain that I can't help her with. I can't recommend this movie to my child or people that love and support her and believe me - I'd love to be able to show family something that helps them not see my daughter as a problem but with a hurt she can't explain. When my daughter spent a month in the hospital for re-feeding and therapy, I was the one to be there, spend the night with her. It wasn't other family or friends",To the Bone
106,gelena_gates,I would like to strongly discourage people from watching this film!,1,28 August 2017,"What a perfectly unsatisfying film!!! How extremely very unlikely is it to find a couple of young adults, suffering from eating disorders (these were not specified in the film), enjoying each other's company in an oriental restaurant, whilst spitting bits of chewed up food into a tissue and guzzling beer?! As far as my understanding of the eating disorders goes, not very likely...Also, from the point of human physiology, someone who is malnourished / starved to the point where their life is in imminent danger, is likely to experience issues with cognition (thinking) and communication. It is therefore extremely unlikely, that a group of people with acute eating disorders, would be interacting casually and animatedly (especially during meal times, when preoccupation with calorie counting and negative self talk take over).Overall a very poor and extremely disappointing portrayal of a very complex issue, and equally poor acting.P.S.: I have given the film 1 star, as it did touch upon a couple of weight loss 'tricks', also the make up artists did a good job.",To the Bone
