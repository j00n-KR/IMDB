0,SnoopyStyle,sweet,8,20 December 2020,"Hina is literally sunshine. She walks through a rooftop portal and becomes the Sunshine Girl. She prays to bring sunshine to a rain-soaked Tokyo. Hodaka is a new arrival in the city. He rescues Hina from a street thug forcing her to work in a club. In order to make some money, they advertise sunshine for pay.It's an animated Japanese fantasy romance. It's very sweet. That's my one word review. The fantasy element with the animation is very beautiful. It has a bit of comedy. It is certainly in line with a few of these Japanese animated fantasy coming-of-age romance in the real world.",Weathering with You
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Not Shinkai's best, but still a pretty good watch overall",6,1 August 2020,"""Tenki no ko"" is a co-production between Japan and China and the latter's involvement surprised me a bit here. The key language is Japanese of course. The big name attached to this project is Makoto Shinkai and in my opinion he is one of the country's finest filmmakers these days and certainly not only when it comes to animation (here he may be the number one in fact). And good news is he is still under 50 years old, so he can very well have another 25 years in the industry or even more and there will be a lot more amazing stuff in store from him for us to appreciate. Now I came across this 110-minute movie a long time ago, way before its release in fact and I got quite curious there already. The main reason for that is that I saw ""Your Name"" a couple years ago without knowing anything pretty much about Shinkai and was blown away by the beauty of that movie. I also hope I can catch some of his older stuff in the future on the big screen. I am positive there will be retrospectives or at least anime weeks during which his achievements from the past are shown once again. I will be there 100%.Now, this one here is not on the same level as ""Your Name"", but that is really only because of how amazing the latter is. ""Tenki no ko"" or ""Weathering with You"" is not a weak film by any definition. There was not a single moment when I considered giving the outcome here a thumbs-down. On the contrary, it is pretty beautiful. It's almost always true with anime these days, especially with crafted artists like Shinkai, but we still should not take that for granted. Examples for stunning scenes are the early depiction of Tokyo, basically everything involving the weather changes and the glorious reunion(s) towards the end. A film that is on a technical level as high as it gets. Good to see that awards bodies agreed and gave this one some recognition, especially the Annie Awards, the Animation Oscars if you want to call them that. At the Oscars it did not get in, but I think it made the shortlist, which is also always a success for foreign movie. Not entirely sure about that though right now. And too lazy to check. By the way, it was also Japan's official submission for the foreign language category wasn't it? Sadly, there it was ignored, but still a very inspired decision to pick an animated film for that. Sadly, the Academy Awards did not agree in a year where another Asian country dominated the show, even winning Best Picture, one that is in my opinion not superior to this one here, but then again it is really completely impossible to compare these two films I assume with how different they are from every perspective.Okay, back to this one here: I will quickly summarize the key story. We have a 16-year-old teenager who is saved by a man I think when falling from a ship or so. The man gives him his card and not much later, even after initial doubts, he goes to visit his savior and begins working for him as a writer. At the same time, he meets a girl who is slightly older (than him) or is she really? This girl has the power to change the weather, which is the key plot and idea here. However, as we find out later on, it seems that the more often she changes the weather, the more she vanishes and may be gone entirely at the end. Still, this created the key question in terms of logical sense for me: Why does she do it? If making moeny is the only reason (together with the boy), then it is pretty absurd. However, she can be seen as an ultimately innocent creature somehow sacrificing her innocence (and life) to please others when they make these orders for beautiful weather. I remember one shot in particular when we see her stand a bit away from the masses and do what she does best with her gift and it is a really breathtakingly beautiful shot. Or of course the scene when she is topless, again in the most innocent sense, because somehow she is or, at that point, has already become a creature of light. If you have seen ""Your Name"", then you will not be surprised at all about the comedy approach Shinkai took here. A great deal of it is linked to romance or sexual references, for example the female protagonist saying she is in love and the male protagonist's reaction to that before she explains what she is in love with. Not who, sorry mate! I feel your pain.Also there are many jokes about the male protagonist allegedly staring at female character's boobs. Well, cleavage really. Anime has an erotic component for many people with how female characters are depicted in particular and I quite like the approach Shinkai seems to take with his works how he uses that attraction and, at the same, time pokes fun at all that. It is not offensive. The reactions by the boy when he is accused of doing so (what the audience did perhaps too, at least straight males and I am not gonna exclude myself there) are hilarious too because of how over the top they are with him acting as if he is completely innocent, which he most likely is not, but then again, it is difficult to watch elsewhere honestly. Even the younger characters get stories about that with the weather girl's little brother and how he already seems to be a bit of a womanizer and gives tips to our hero, who is clearly less experienced. At 16 definitely not a shame though. And also the grown-up dude I mentioned earlier and the idea that his niece is his affair was pretty funny too. By the way, this man has perhaps the most shades from everybody here. He is a good guy, saves the teen's life early on (like I stated) and also helps him, even with a gun pointed at him (interesting connection to their first meeting in terms of life and death), get away in the end from the cops in order to run to her. He may still be a bit ruthless financially with what he pays (or doesn't pay) his new employee as we find out in a scene with two characters in the car. And the female who finds out about the sum is outraged. And that was also funny with how over the top she goes. This approach at comedy (characters reacting in really over-the-top ways, also visually with effects) is one you frequently find in anime and I like it. Especially when it is so well done as it is here. It still feels like a realistic movie and there are, even if it is fantasy at its core, many aspects from the ""normal world"". Just take the cops. The guns. Some of the (not too graphic) violence. By the way, are there really internet cafés in Tokyo where you can take a shower for a few bucks? For real? Please tell me, Japanese friends, when you read this. My email address is in my profile.So, also away from these matters of the heart, it is an interesting and very entertaining film. I personally found the first reunion of the two main characters (Hodaka and Japanese weather girl Hina) more beautiful than the second, but that is of course entirely subjective. Maybe you'll like the other more. I guess many will because that one is true closure. Of course, there is also music in these scenes that is really loud and feels spectacular. It's good. I would have been perfectly fine with this movie getting the Oscar nomination, no matter in which category, preferrably in both, but the fact that it did not, does not make it an inferior film. My suggestion is to give it a watch unless you despise the genre, but honestly, then you would not be here and also you would not have read my review until this point. Probably you have seen It already and I hope you liked it as much as I did. It deserves the accolades, no surprise high-profile American actors were hired to do the voices for the international version. I watched the Japanese original though (with German subtitles) and, even if I do not speak Japanese, I think they did a good job judging from the sounds and intonation of their voices. So, in short, there is probably not a single production value with which you can see anything other than professionals at work. Check it out. I am really glad I got to see this on the big screen after I had almost no hope anymore I could because this film premiered a long time ago here in Germany already I think and was not shown in too many theaters in general. Their loss. Don't let it be yours.",Weathering with You
2,CinemaSerf,Gloriously stylish modern day fairy tale,7,30 January 2020,"This is a wonderfully illustrated and scored example of a man's vivid and creative imagination carefully crafted onto film. The story centres on a young boy (""Hodaka"") who befriends (""Hina"") in an exceptionally wet Tokyo. As the story develops, it transpires she has some ability to manipulate the weather but at a terrible cost to herself. Together with her younger brother they have a series of adventures as they try to make some money from her skill and to bring happiness as the relentless rain has a naturally demoralising effect on their fellow citizens. It is certainly too long - at times towards the end, the story drags a little - but the soundtrack is great; no great rousing shouty power-ballads and the animation is beautifully detailed with delightful hues and shades. Makoto Shinkai doesn't quite reach the heights of 'Your Name"" with this, but there really isn't that much in it. Needs a big screen, if you can, to do the character animation justice.",Weathering with You
3,cherold,slight story powered by stunning water animation,8,28 September 2020,"I can't help but suspect that writer/director Makoto Shinkai did make this movie because he thought he had an interesting story but simply because he wanted to play with rain animations.I'm okay with that. The animation is stunning, and no one is quite so good as taking something as simple as drops in a puddle and creating a gorgeous symphony as Shinkai.All the same, a story would have been nice and there really isn't much of one here, nor does what exists make any particular sense. But the characters are charming, the movie is funny and touching, and while it's no ""Your Name"" it is Shinkai's third best film (Garden of Words is 2nd).Well worth watching.",Weathering with You
4,Irishchatter,Really loved the animation but the major disappointment was that there's not a better story involved,4,25 May 2020,"Honestly I'm so disappointed with this anime that it didn't have an indept story like ""Your Name"". Yeah we know it's about a girl who changes the weather and a 16 year old lad ran away from home to live in Tokyo. That was it...The animation was absolutely gorgeous like I don't understand why they didn't add a good story to the film seriously?!?!",Weathering with You
5,westsideschl,Flat & Stilted,3,18 October 2020,"Storyline: A Sunshine girl parts the clouds, and stops the rain by praying. Sure!, and did we fail middle school science.
Theme: You can only be happy if it's blue sky & sunny while depressed if it's raining. Wrong, I think you can find joy in whatever the weather.Yes, it was very popular in Tokyo (the setting, of course). Like most animé there's heavy reliance on small budgets, e.g. hand drawn with limited time; limited moving pieces; where Disney would take 48 frames, Japanese anime would take 5 frames; saved costs by recycling stock sequences w/different backdrops; strong storylines means movement can be minimal. Result: Keeping costs at 1/5 of other animations.On the positive side they actually have a few background objects moving, especially in one short series where plants & clouds move, unlike most animé with just the foreground central character moving. This film's best animations were raindrops, although once you render one you just have to repeat multiple times. Backdrop city & dwellings were highly detailed but still flat 2-D. Skin & hair, solid no detail or movement, (contrasted with the recent ""The Lion King"" or ""His Dark Materials""). Office lights in Tokyo buildings did not turn on/off; plants & clouds don't move.
Unfortunately viewers in Japan are conditioned to this cheap artificiality.",Weathering with You
6,UniqueParticle,Masterful anime film,10,16 January 2020,"One of the best experiences I ever had! So glad I got to see in the theater today. The soundtrack is incredible, the sounds are ambient, story is spectacularly immersive and beautiful! A truly heartwarming film about unorthodox weather, romance and a bit of suspense. I love everything about Weathering with you, I was captivated throughout although I barely watch anime now I wanna see more. I wanna own the movie when available; well worth the 17 dollars. Also my 750th review!",Weathering with You
7,briancham1994,Overly sentimental,4,6 August 2020,"Maybe if I were still twelve years old, I would like this film. I thought Your Name was too sentimental and this film just follows in the same vein. The visuals of this film are gorgeous but the story is a mess. There are too many characters with their own subplots, the romance is contrived, the protagonist's obsession is selfish (he drowns Tokyo!), there is little resolution, the plot is predictable and the characters seem very nonchalant about real supernatural powers proven on TV. There were good moments with a lot of potential, and I really wanted to liked this film, but I felt alienated. The overabundance of cheesy pop music, product placement, anime teen romance clichés and glamourisation of modern teen culture made it seem hollow, commercial and pandering to the young audiences.",Weathering with You

10,Vartiainen,"A stupidly beautiful anime film about weather, friends and struggle",7,14 July 2020,"Makoto Shinkai's newest film has the unenviable task of measuring up to his surprise hit, Your Name. And while many will probably hope that this film had been a bit more separated from that, it has to be kept in mind that this film was at the very least in the planning stages when Your Name became a worldwide phenomenon.Weathering with You is a film about Hodaka Morishima (voice by Kotaro Daigo), a high school student who runs away from home to live in Tokyo where he meets plenty of colourful personalities. One of them being Hina Amano (Nana Mori), a fellow student who happens to have a talent for affecting the weather with her prayers. Hodaka quickly realizes the money-making opportunities in this and the two of them strike up a business. But what is the source of Hina's abilities?First of all, the film is crazy beautiful. Like, it's kind of distracting how good it looks. The backgrounds especially are a sight to behold. Clearly animated, but almost more detailed than real life, in a strange way. The character animation is not quite as flawless, especially in comparison, but it's objectively quite fine and fluid.And of course there's the weather animation, which is a particular key characteristic of Shinkai's films. The dude animates weather and sky the same way Hayao Miyazaki animates food.So the characters are interesting and the animation works. Unfortunately, the story is a tad lackluster. It's still enjoyable, but it misses that gut-wrenching intensity of Your Name. Likewise the romance between Hodaka and Hina just isn't what it could be.Although I greatly enjoyed Nagi (Sakura Kiryu), Hina's younger brother, and his harem of young girls. Dude was adorable.Weathering with You is a great film when viewed objectively. In comparison to Your Name it leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't think that should be held against it.",Weathering with You
11,lisafordeay,Very good anime,8,3 February 2021,"Weathering With You is a 2019 romantic fantasy anime and tells the story of a young boy named Hodaka a runaway who travels to Tokyo and meets a young girl named Hina who can control the weather. But will there be a sacrifice involved?The animation is stunning,the charcthers are likeable along with the score. There was one scene that got me teary eyed towards the end.There is 2 versions of this film too. One is in English while the other is in Japanese(the version I saw today).If you love Studio Ghilbi styled movies then check it out.",Weathering with You

13,tadpole-596-918256,"The theater in which I saw this animated feature ran it as a ""PSA"" . . .",8,11 February 2020,". . . (or Public Service Announcement), with the original Japanese dialog subtitled in English (despite the most recent U.S. census report showing that not a single resident of this multiplex's densely populated 36-square-mile enclave reports themselves as being of Asian descent, while 98.9% self-identify with Kobe's group). How, then, can WEATHERING WITH YOU be regarded as a PSA, one might query. Simple. The content of this movie indicates that with its history of being a nuclear dumping zone and a nuke reactor melt-down site, as well as serving as a magnet for tsunamis and earthquakes, Japan is figuratively underwater already, and will become literally more so as Global Warming results in sky-rocketing sea level rise and unprecedented rains surpassing even the Deluge experienced by Noah. The final scenes of WEATHERING WITH YOU suggest that Tokyo is a Dead City Walking, and soon Japan will not have enough living residents to bury its deceased population. Therefore, any day now a lucrative job market will open up for hardy outsiders fluent in Japanese. What better recruiting tool could be brought to bear than the un-dubbed version WEATHERING WITH YOU, accompanied by English subtitles? So pack up your shovels, because soon all of those cancelled flights connecting America's inner cities to pestilent China can be profitably redirected to Japan!",Weathering with You

Look I will freely admit while Your Name is a good movie but honestly, it's not that great to what others think.The plot for this anime actually made more sense and somewhat reached out to me a lot more.The chemistry between Hina and Honoka was actually there in contrast to Taki and Mitsuha (although I was happy that they meet each other in the end.) at least they have actual screen time which your name lacked. Not to mention the characters were more likeable.Overall I really recommend this film.",Weathering with You

21,phanthinga,Another fantastic anime from Makoto Shinkai,9,3 September 2019,"Your Name (2016) directed by Makoto Shinkai an absolute masterpiece of animation and sound design emotionally destroyed me and probably any anime fan in general at that time so to finally able to watch his latest project Weathering with You (2019) yesterday despite the bad weather in my country I gotta say it quite a memorable cinema experience. Weathering With You while no doubt is a masterwork of animation from the beautiful background to the quirky character and the soundtrack definitely will be on my playlist in the future but when it comes to the star-crossed lover's story with supernatural element it overlaps so much with Your Name in term of storywise that I got a hard time to focus on Weathering With You without comparing it scene to scene with Your Name in my head and that a real shame because I really want to remember the anime as its own thing, not Your Name 2.0. Granted, because Your Name is my first exposure to the director Makoto Shinkai so please take my review with a grain of salt and see the anime for yourself",Weathering with You
22,RforFilm,The sun shines bright on this anime. Weathering with You is a magical urban story that should please a lot of people,8,21 January 2020,"As people, even with the new technology we've discovered, we're still controlled by the weather. The Earth has been consistently been shaped and molded by the weather for billions of years and will continue to do so after people are gone. Getting back to now, we tend to take for granted how much we've had to plan everything around extreme heat, rain, snow, or even the devastation of fires and tornados. It affects communications and transport. It can throw events inside or even cancel them if things are bad enough. As humans, our whole lives have to work around the weather.
Living in Southern California, I'm used to consistent sunshine and the heat that comes with it. Most of the year its great, but during the summer, my whole way of life adapts to the indoors to avoid the over one hundred degree heat. I'm also lucky to be away from areas that have constant rain and humidity. Let's say science had found a way to make whatever whether we'd want, would you use it? I'd bet a lot of money that you would. The story of a girl who can bring the sun is mixed in with a love story in the new anime Weathering with You.
Young Hodaka Morishima is a teenage runaway to goes to a rainy Tokyo looking for meaning and purpose. He's saved from falling off the boat by a man Keisuke Suga who tells the boy to come to him for help if needed. Hodaka unsuccessfully tries to make it on his own before he goes to Keisuke and gets a job at his publishing company. Hokaka also meets a college girl Natsumi who he assumes is Keisuke's mistress. Together, they all write articles about urban legends and conspiracy theories for a tabloid paper.
While out on an assignment, he finds a teenage girl Hina and helps her escape a club trying to hire her. They make it to an abandoned building where she reveals she can bring the sunshine for brief periods after praying. The two realize that they could turn her magical skill into a business and help Tokyo with the greater then usual rainfall. Hodaka also uncovers that she is something called a ""weather maiden"" who, according to legend, can bring the weather. The two go about their business as Hodaka continues to write about her. But what happens when Hina uses up her time and what happens to Tokyo?
Weathering with You is the highly anticipated follow up to the masterpiece of Your Name, which was directed by Makoto Shinkai. Honestly, this is another great movie that builds on what made Your Name incredible...perhaps a little too closely. It's a different story and a different kind of magic the characters face, but when you think about the plot points and how the love story plays out, it's similar to Your Name. those that haven't seen Your Name aren't going to notice, but it was a little distracting for me.
I can't say the ruins everything because everything else is really good. I'll start by admiring how beautiful this movie is to look at. Anime is known for amplifying the hand drawn style, but this is something that really hypnotizes you and takes you into this Tokyo. As with Your Name, locations are beautiful, the weather is beautiful, and even the food is beautiful (including what has to be the best-looking Big Mac I've seen from a McDonalds). Almost any frame could be put on a matte and probably be called a masterpiece.
The story may be hitting some beats of Weathering with You, but I still liked it. I think it's because they try to main the main characters different in Weathering with You. Hina is very likable as a girl who herself doesn't understand her powers. Though his teenage angst got a little annoying, you could still get behind Hodaka as a lot of kids who want to see the world would want to. The biggest difference is that their relationship affects a lot more people...and I mean the population of Tokyo. Much of where the future of the rain and city goes depends on the relationship of our heroes.I'll give this eight anime McDonalds out of ten. While it's not as good as Your Name, that's like saying is off by a few points rather then a level. Keep in mind I saw the English dub, though I expect the Japanese language movie to be just as good. Anime fans will love this, and perhaps some of the mainstream crowd if their open to it. The sun shines on this movie.",Weathering with You
23,ghostfiendghost,Shinkai does it again!,9,17 January 2020,"Saw this film at the preview screening Fanthom event. This film was a great follow up to the massive hit Your Name and I think does a great job of showing that Ghibli and Miyazaki aren't the only names to look into when it comes to Japanese animation. RADWIMPS is great again providing the soundtrack which is honestly one of my favorites of the decade for a film. Safe to say I'll be buying a Blu-ray of this when it releases here in North America.Rant Time!
Btw anybody that says this film is straight up an anti climate change movie needs to think for a sec.
One, this film is obviously fictional considering uh There Are No Sunshine Girls People!
Two, this is a film inspired by climate change and weather. It infers to people what can happen if we let the world go crazy like it is. the weather throughout is creating a miserable environment for the people of Tokyo so it makes you wonder if that what we want to live with.
Three, its a romance fictional movie obviously not sending a message about climate change focus on the films story and film-making not your agenda.",Weathering with You
24,kjproulx,A Wonderful Story From Beginning to End,9,16 January 2020,"Being someone who watches many movies and television shows, Anime films and shows are things that I just never got around to watching much. After watching my first few shows back in 2012, I began to love them. Still, I don't watch nearly as many as I would like, but I do seek out the highly talked about ones. When Your Name hit theatres back in 2016, I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it and I was eagerly awaiting director Makoto Shinkai's next project. Weathering with You is his latest work and although I haven't seen most of his filmography, this may be his finest work yet.Weathering with You follows young Morishima Hodaka runs away from home and finds himself in Tokyo, Japan. Meeting young Amano Hina, they form a friendship that grows stronger and stronger as he realizes she is known as a ""Sunshine Girl"" and can control the weather. Tokyo, on the verge of flooding, is not benefitted by the fact that she has chosen to use these powers to clear the skies for money, but also to make people happy. Learning some brutal truths about what her powers lie in store for her, this film takes a turn that feels very much earned by the end.I'm a sucker for a good fantasy film and although you do have to suspend your disbelief in order to believe abilities like this exist (since there's no real explanation as to why she has these powers, to begin with), I found myself incredibly engaged from start to finish. It's the simple moments like when the core characters would be fleeing from the law and settling down to enjoy each other's company that really stood out to me. Yes, the fantastical elements are very much present and are obviously where the movie ends up, but it has a lot more going for it than just that.If I had to complain about something though, I would have to admit that there were two occasions where songs took me out of the movie. Not to rip on composer Radwimps, because his work here is absolutely wonderful, but the songs themselves were a little overbearing in a few scenes that felt like they should've been slightly quieter and more intense. His score is absolutely stunning and I was swept up in it, but a couple of songs just felt slightly out of place to me. With that said, I really don't have any huge complaints about the film overall.In the end, Weathering with You is a film that sets up a fantasy storyline and follows through on it from start to finish. It has very likeable characters and I truly cared about each one of them by the time the credits began to roll. For being as grand as it is, I really just found myself appreciating the simpler moments. That's hard for a film to do when so many other things are going on. I loved watching this film and I would even call it one of the best films to hit theatres in 2019, even though it's only reaching certain countries now. Weathering with You is an absolute delight.",Weathering with You
25,Blue-Grotto,Sunshine Girl and Climate Change,9,19 September 2019,"The sky is unknown as the ocean. Human hearts are connected to it and mysterious powers flow from it. So when a teen girl passes through an ancient Shinto gate and says a prayer for her dying mother, she is favored by the spirit world and forces of nature, and gains an influence over the weather. She brings sunshine to those who need it. For a young runaway boy as well as the entire city of Tokyo suffering from climate change and unearthly long rains, this sunshine girl is a blessing. Yet the more light and good that she brings the more she changes and disconnects from her surroundings. It is up to her friends to help her back.Weathering With You includes some beautiful artwork characteristic of the genre; the sparkle of sunlight on the sea, reflected light on the surface of water, the play of wind, three dimensional fireworks and more. Makoto Shinkai-san who was at the North American premiere at the Toronto international film festival, said that the people who need anime the most are teens. The younger generation is his target audience here in this meditation on climate change and ancient spiritual power. His characters are not defined by their past and hopefully humanity will not be as well.

Written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, 5 Centimeters Per Second), it is yet another poignant story from the acclaimed anime artist that stands well above most other animated films of this era.In Tokyo, young high school student Hodaka Morishima attempts to find work and a place to live after running away from home. At the time, Japan is going through severe rain, halting the progress of many important events. After finding work at a small publishing company, Hodaka is tasked with researching urban legends around the local area, interviewing people who may have knowledge of such a subject. Eventually, Hodaka meets a mysterious girl named Hina, who to his surprise, has the amazing ability to control the weather by simply closing her eyes and praying. Intrigued by her powers, Hodaka decides to befriend Hina to understand her better as a person.Beautifully animated and touching, Weathering With You is guaranteed to provide just the right amount of entertainment for any fan of Makoto Shinkai's work. While it doesn't quite reach the level of cleverness as ""Your Name"", it still has enough originality to separate it from its predecessor and stand on its own without drawing too much comparison. The animation is simply gorgeous, easily on par with Studio Ghibli, perhaps even more so. The attention to detail on the raindrops and water is highly reminiscent of Shinkai's 2013 film ""The Garden Of Words"", another of his work that used rain as a plot device. The characters are likeable and well developed, particularly Hodaka and Hina. Every scene they were together I could always feel the growing friendship between the two. However, the one major gripe I had was that the story was highly predictable. By the time the third act has begun, it's very obvious how things are going to end. Aside from that, this anime film is certainly worth one's time. The version I watched was in Japanese with English subtitles, but I am interested in seeing a dubbed version when it is readily available.I rate it 8/10",Weathering with You
28,catpantry,surrendering to our 4 seasons,9,4 February 2020,Its been a long 311 month wrist grab (and pull). It started when someone walked next to a scare crow and saw it shivering. And without thinking the scare crow said: 'would it be possible for you to love a tiny sphere of air that longs through the ocean and accidentally bumps into a dolphin. And without thinking the person tattoos two exact shapes close together on their shoulder. The next thing that happened was a chopper flew so low that its air force sculpted the exact shape of a ford f-150 into some wide open grass plains. The helicopter pilot was rich. He smiled like Richard Hampton.,Weathering with You
29,garethcrook,Extraordinary!,9,6 February 2020,"Well for starters this might well be the most beautiful animation I've ever seen. A truly breathtaking piece of hyper-real art. It tells the fantastic story of Hodaka and Hina, as they meet in a rain soaked Tokyo. Hina is no ordinary girl though and can control the sun, banishing the rain from the city, momentarily making everyone happy. Every time she does though, she loses a little more of herself, destined to finally disappear and become part of the sky with which she's become connected. On realising this, Hodaka, a teenage runaway, does everything he can to hold on to the girl he's fallen in love with, but the earthly bounds of the society around him, make that anything but easy. It's a love story, but one woven with charming comedy, assorted characters and the real life grit of living on the breadline and being wanted by the authorities in a vast metropolitan city. The animation truly is something else, whether it's the rain, the jaw dropping aerial shots of the city or the stunning camera work, which would be heart-stopping if real, but is truly staggering when animated. A beautiful piece of extraordinary cinema.",Weathering with You

34,sirwillisiv,Beautifully animated and fairly engaging...,8,23 February 2020,"Weathering with You is like a modern day fairytale, telling the story of a teenage runaway in Tokyo who meets a mysterious girl who can control the weather. Beautifully animated and rich with atmosphere, Weathering with You is an engaging, character-driven and often funny laid back fantasy. The romance felt genuine, natural and well-paced; not sappy at all. However, the film doesn't really leave a bite; not much food for thought. It brings up interesting subtexts about human ingenuity and even dystopia, but kind of leaves them hanging for an obligatory upbeat and utterly predictable conclusion. Nonetheless, it's a visually stunning slice-of-life. One of the best looking anime films I've seen and with a fairly strong helping of riveting drama.",Weathering with You

36,Shostakovich343,Weathering with You,7,10 May 2020,"There is no shame in being a good director's third best film. That ""Weathering with You"" is not Makoto Shinkai's masterpiece doesn't make it a less competent and entertaining film. Among the director's works, I would rank it behind ""50 Centimetres per Second"" and his biggest hit, ""Your Name"".Since that is also his previous film, comparisons are inevitable, much to ""Weathering with You""'s detriment. It is not as structurally clean or emotionally resonant as its beloved predecessor. On the other hand, it doesn't feel like an exact copy-and-paste job either, which would have been worse. Yes, it is also about distanced lovers, but that goes for any Shinkai production. In fact, the lovers in question are not even distanced for most of the film. It only takes a while for them to find each other.We meet the boy, Hondaka, as he makes his way to Tokyo. He has fled his remote hometown in favour of the big city, but not considered the difficulties of finding employment or housing as a sixteen-year-old.Hondaka's first days in the city come as a big disappointment, then. To him, mind, not to us. You won't find Tokyo looking better anywhere else, including real life. Shinkai's blend of hand-drawn, computer-animated and rotoscoped animation is simply the best in the business. If ""Weathering with You"" is not his very most beautiful film (that remains ""The Garden of Words"") it will still be the best-looking animated film to come out all year.Hondaka is taken in by a man named Keisuke, who could have walked out of a modern day Dickens novel. He offers the boy some money in return for his services as reporter and lets him share his appartment floor. Since Hondaka is an underage runaway, the terms of employment do not exactly meet union standards -- you could well say he is being used by this man. No doubt Keisuke would be willing to kick him out if it suited his interest, and yet you sense he has a soft spot for the boy. Look no further for the film's best realised character.During his reporting work, Hondaka finally meets his girl, Hina, who incidentally has the ability to manipulate the weather. As they are both on their uppers (Keisuke pays 3,000 yen a month -- about a dime and a quarter), they set up a business to deliver sunshine on demand.I don't have to tell you that messing with the climate comes at a price. That is a predictable and rather heavy moral, and it's all for the good that Shinkai doesn't stress it too much. You can still read ""Weathering with You"" as a metaphor for climate change if you want, but the director is more concerned with the relationship between his leads, and that is where the film's heart lies.Alas, that is also the point where ""Weathering with You"" begins to rumble, mostly because of Hina. She is too archetypical an anime girl to be interesting. No, she isn't a Tsundere, but her role in this story is wholly instrumental to Hondaka's. She has to be there for him to be supported by, to fall in love with, and to save in her utter helplessness.I am not bothered by this on an ethical level. It's just that as a result of her shallow motivation Hina is a less compelling character. And that, in turn, drags down the romance as a whole. Compare this to ""Your Name"", whose lovers were placed in a more egalitarian position: Mitsuha leapt from the screen in ways that Hina simply cannot near.Hondaka, too, is a bit of a git at first; rather too innocent for the Dickensian life he enters. However, when he and Hina are separated in the final act, he reveals himself to be quite the monomaniac. The moment he gets his hands on a gun we begin to fear our protagonist more than the men obstructing his way to true love.Such are the aspects that elevate ""Weathering with You"", but they cannot hide that its core is a bit meagre. You will probably leave the film satisfied, but not touched.Never is this illustrated better than during one pivotal moment, when Hondaka and Hina fall from the sky while holding each other's hands -- an obvious hommage to Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"". That film turns my waterworks on like few others can, but ""Weathering with You"" left me dry overall -- no matter the amount of beautifully rendered clouds it features.",Weathering with You

The main characters Hodaka and Hina find a new love, in his quest of moving to Tokyo.The story is simple but its Skinkai's inspiration is not: climate change and global warming. It references Toyko's geological past, possibly future and dwells into Shinto life/death beliefs.The film features new songs by J-pop band, Radwimps. The animation of rain water is luxuriously done throughout the entire film by Shinkai's team, drawn from the defunct Ghibli Studios.Its obvious that the film shows Toyko's hyper-consumerist attitude it even displays US cultural influences luke McDonald's fast food.

41,Ladiloque,Half misstep,6,9 May 2020,"Shinkai's latest production ""Tenki no ko"" delivers just where the latest Japanese anime prodigy has accustomed us to: delicate bittersweet sentimentality, helpless nostalgic sadness, detailed entwined natural-artificial settings, the tragic beauty and frailty of life as experienced by innocent people.Unfortunately it also follows ""Kimi no na wa"" (2016) and his first full lenght ""Kumo no muko, yakusoku no basho"" (2004) - and possibly ""Hoshi o ou kodomo"" (2011) but my memory isn't quite sure - where I think it showed the possibly weakest aspects of the author's narrative style: coherent, engaging and believable complex plotlines. That is: as he tries to build complex plotlines, we end up getting something not really consistent or weak scenes and characters just to connect the dots in the story.And while the music-songs, the refined imagery, bits of Japanese culture, the clumsy cuteness and the funny moments always keep the bar high in terms of viewing pleasure, it feels like we are tricked into liking the movie. Though the translation might be partially responsible I think that the main problem lies elsewhere. And of course it doesn't have anything to do with the ""magic/sci-fi"" aspects of the stories: 90% of the best japanese animation include totally ""unrealistic stuff"" (for lack of a better term) yet we don't care a bit and we love it. It's about symbols and allegories, Japanese traditional beliefs and sometimes - the few times I find annoying but accept them nonetheless as poetic license - it's about Dantesque deus ex machina moments: the blinding, the inexplicable, the uncomprehensible. None of these - done wisely - ruin a story.Think instead to his shorts: by definition you can't build complex characters, circumstances or settings but this doesn't prevent them from being brillant. With just few touches Shinkai instills life to his fictional worlds and characters.
""Kanojo to kanojo no neko"" (both the 1999 version and the ""mini series"" version) is so original and touching yet the simplest thing ever: you could even think you've just been tricked someway... but no: it's just poetry.
Or the dramatic and powerful ""Hoshi no koe"" (2002). Which sci-fi can afford to last 20 minutes? Can you even introduce a world in such a short time? Yet it works, and the result is incredibly moving.Consider now his 2 ""shorter full lenght movies"" ""Byosoku 5 senchimetoru"" (2007) and ""Koto no ha no niwa"" (2013): both under 1 hour lenght.
If you try to summarize the plots you would feel dumb. And I guess Makoto felt like that when he first tried to offer them to some producers. Simplest story. No plot. Nothing ""relevant"" happens.
Yet they are IMHO his best productions.I won't indulge myself into deconstructing the motives, purposes and externalities of all those involved: I just acknowledge that the least monetizable formats end up being the best ones, while the more ""classic"" productions are a little disappointing.Anyways while I will look forward to watching any of Shinkai's future endevours I hope we will get less traditional storylines, car chases, cheap cuteness and teen-targeted stuff... and more intimate looks into the depths of the human condition.And to the casual viewer who has to decide if watching ""Tenki no ko-Weathering with you"" or not: don't! Find and watch ""Kimi no na wa-Your name"" (2016) or ""Koto no ha no niwa-The garden of words"" (2013) beforehand. They surely represent a better introduction to Shinkai's work.",Weathering with You
42,cappiethadog,Raintown,7,14 February 2020,"Eastern religion as a subset of science fiction is what ""Weathering With You"" has in common with ""Your Name"". In both films, a Shinto shrine gate acts as a portal to the metaphysical world. That is what makes filmmaker Makoto Shinkai an auteur. Where does god end and science begin? Or vice-versa? God can be proved empirically; ancient myths played out in the modern world where superstition melds into science. Since the filmmaker borrows heavily from ""Eternal of the Sunshine Mind"", both films, but ""Your Name"", in particular, the audience is forced to look at the Michael Gondry film(with a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman) in a new light; a spiritual one.Montauk on a weekday; it makes no sense, this sudden impulse to go there. Joel Barrish(Jim Carrey) is waiting for a train at the Long Island Railroad, his daily commute, with an inexplicable desire to play hooky from work. It's winter; it'll be snowing. The Hamptons are out of season; the lake will be frozen, and yet some internal voice, like a narrator, tells him that he show run towards the Montauk line as if his life depended on it. Clementine Krucynski(Kate Winslet), a blue-haired free-spirit, should be ringing up customers at Barnes and Noble, and yet finds herself draw to the same platform, flagging down, with tentative waves of her hand, a complete stranger who can't life his head long enough to return the friendly gesture with accompanying eye contact, despite being so afar. Joel utilizes both sides of the train station column to hide, but Clementine stymies his disappearing act, mimicking the same short steps it takes to face towards and away from the train track that leads to the Hamptons. They formally introduce themselves in the passenger car, intoxicated with the mystery of meeting somebody, these reunited lovers who found each other, beating impossible odds of this ever happening. Advancements in science made it possible for this woman, then the man, to erase the memories of falling in and out of love. But here they are. On another road to nowhere, they embark, again.Names are superfluous and arbitrary things. Both boy and girl pass each other on a staircase and know intuitively that they belong together. Mitsuha(Mone Shiraishi) will never know that she died when a meteor hit her small village in Itomori. Wormholes and Shinto rituals brought the girl back to life. Taki(Ryunosuke Kamiki) was in the right body, his own, back in Tokyo during the natural disaster that killed 500 Itomori residents three years ago. Around the same time, a girl he never met before, stood in front of him in a train car and said his name. Mitsuha leaves behind her kumihimo, a braided ribbon when unraveled, acts as a corded rope that connects the boy and girl across time and space. The wormhole is at the train station That's the key to their bodily time-sharing. As a girl, Taki discovers how science and religion are interconnected. It constitutes a musubi, an intertwining union. Mitsuha/Taki was the original musubi, a bodily coalescing made possible when god answered the small town girl's plea to be reborn as a handsome Tokyo boy. ""Your Name"", unintentional or not, suggests that Mayugoro, a Shinto deity, created the black hole that allows Mitsuha and Taki to bounce back and forth between a three-year time span, like a yoyo. Atheism would have given Mitsuha's death permanence, but Taki's spiritual side allows for the possibility of a rebirth, because he believes in kuchikamizake, a ritual alcohol, which the young girl's grandmother described as being half of Mitsuha. He drinks the sake, made from masticated rice that Mitsuha spit back into a small urn for fermentation, a traditional Shinto ceremony. An amalgamation of faith and quantum physics propels the culminating switch, which allows for Taki, as Mitsuha, to evacuate the townsfolk from the Tiamat Comet's destructive pathway.There it is again; the Shinto shrine gate, this time placed on the roof of a tenement building, in ""Weathering With You"", the follow-up to ""Your Name"", released two years earlier. Hina Amano(Nana Mori) walks through a red gate, just like her Itomori-born predecessor, and finds herself transported into a multiverse ocean that extends vertically from ground to sky. Hodaka Morishima(Kotaro Daigo), an island boy, defeated by the high cost of Tokyo living, first meets Hina at McDonald's as a loitering customer who accepts the free Big Mac with gratitude. By hanging out, platonically, as brother and sister, Hodaka discovers the girl's ability to change the weather through prayer. The sun comes out, albeit for a little while; a temporary reprieve from the constant downpour that threatens to flood Tokyo, an elemental dystopia. The journalist-turned-entrepreneur suggests to Hina that they start an online business, advertising her as the ""Sunshine Girl"", in which they charge people money for a little unobstructed daylight. Hodaka's former employers, Kei(Shun Oguri), the owner of a small publishing company that specializes in the supernatural, and Natsumi(Tsubasa Honda), his niece and assistant, meanwhile, are on assignment, interviewing a Shinto priest about the inordinate amount of rain that threatens to put Japan underwater. Like ""Your Name"", science and religion are sutured together. The subject of climate change is never broached. ""The weather changes on a whim, regardless of human needs,"" or to state it more plainly, the old man believes that the never-ending torrential rains were predestined, indicative of mankind's limited time on earth. It's an apolitical war on science; a war not driven by the notion that this monotonous storm isn't being cultivated by a capitalist's relationship with fossil fuels. ""Fixing the weather is the weather maiden's job."" he insists. As foretold by the Shinto priest, Hina dies, giving up her life for the greater good. Her heart stops. The rain stops. The sun, once again, makes regular appearances. Japanese civilization is granted an extended stay without worry of turning into the Atlantis. Hodaka, though, coming from a more traditional, less westernized area of Japan, has other ideas. Since Hina is a Shinto deity, he favors the girl over Tokyo's population, because according to doctrine, only the emperor and his descendants were created in God's image, whereas Christians believe that all of humankind was. Depending on who you are, Hodaka could either be the hero or villain. The thunderstruck boy, full of romantic and spiritual love, goes through the same Shinto shrine gate, a portal to the sky, and retrieves the human sacrifice, which undoes Hina's environmental work, dooming Tokyo to a metropolis with no future. ""Pray for yourself,"" he tells Hina, adding: ""I care more about you than some blue sky."" One woman shouldn't have to pay the price for the hubris of man.Are Joel and Clementine reincarnated? In a metaphorical sense, they are. Lacuna Inc., the memory erasure company run by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson), is in the killing business. To Joel, the woman he meets on the train to Montauk is neither a new nor old lover, but closer in spirit to some lover from a past life, the life he remembers in dreams. Makoto Shinkai turns ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" Japanese. In ""Weathering With You"", Kei doesn't remember the day it started to rain again. Science puts a stop to the magical thinking of his past. Kei can't carry the burden of his actions. He helped Hodaka elude police capture, aiding and abetting his former employee's successful attempt to mitigate eternal rain with sunshine.",Weathering with You
43,ccamp89,Solid 1.5 // Frankenstein,3,18 January 2020,"I wasn't as head-over-heels for Shinkai's last film, Your Name, as everyone else seemed to be, but I still enjoyed its unabashed, cosmic take on teen romance. It was a bit melodramatic for my taste, but it had an undeniable charm and a pure-hearted intent that was hard to resist. Given the fact that it went on to become the highest-grossing anime of all time in Japan, I guess you can't blame the guy for trying to capture the same magic with his follow up. But sadly, Weathering with You is such a transparent rehashing that it feels like a parody of itself. It takes all of the same elements - teen love, fate, fantastical realism, coming of age, melodrama, natural wonder - and remixes it into a frankenstein version of Your Name without any of the finesse or charm. The main characters here can be boiled down to ""boy who ran away from home"" and ""girl who lost her mom."" In two hours, we learn absolutely nothing about these individuals or their families. Instead, we're treated to ridiculously overblown setpieces soundtracked by overbearing pop-rock tunes which fall eye-rollingly flat given that no time at all is spent investing us in these characters. The first half isn't awful and does a serviceable job of setting a tone, but the third act is an absolute train wreck full of clashing tones, poorly-executed action sequences, sloppy writing, and ridiculous plot contrivances. The writing is a problem for much of the film as well with clunky exposition and extremely on-the-nose dialogue in which the characters gratingly explain the movie to you. I have to say, I'm a bit baffled at the positive reception for this. Even if you loved Your Name, I wouldn't recommend it.Solid 1.5/5",Weathering with You
44,valen060,Shinkai Dazzles. Rain Foresees What Tomorrow May Bring,9,18 January 2020,"I have plenty to say about this film, so I'll start with this: Director Makoto Shinkai has definitely released a slew of amazing film projects in the last decade (5 Centimeters Per Second, The Garden of Words, Your Name).His latest work Weathering With You (Tenki no Ko) is something that is both visually crafted and unique characters that have really caught my attention. With its amazing cityscapes and the contrast of the rain - a recurring theme in some of Shinkai's work - is something that encompasses these characters all around. The inclusion of a few real-life companies in the background also adds to the realism.The story goes about a high school student named Hodaka, who is a runaway from his home island, stumbles upon a young girl named Hina in Tokyo who has the ability to control the weather. Curious, they get to know one another overtime, but things dramatically shift to more pressing matters in their personal lives and the circumstance surrounding her abilities.'Weathering With You' has proven to be an anime film that doesn't surpass Shinkai's 2016 phenomenal hit 'Your Name' in terms of popularity or high recognition in any way, but is merely trying to capture that same essence and becoming unique in its own right. Like 'Your Name,' it focuses on themes of a fantasy nature woven together with a dramatic blend of heartwarming and captivating moments. The involvement of familiar celebrity names like Alison Brie and Lee Pace in the English dub voice cast is an interesting choice since this practice is done usually with Studio Ghibli's movies for its American audiences. Nevertheless, it's nice to see non-anime voice actors actually take part in Shinkai's work, which in my opinion is unheard of. I, especially enjoyed the music provided by the return of J-rock band RADWIMPS. As before, their songs play out well and makes the story feel more immersive and spellbound. Shinkai has really made it up to the ranks of other notable animation directors outside Japan, including his recognition at the Annie Awards. I congratulate him.The scenario is somewhat familiar, but it's still unforgettable to my eyes and ears. Though it wouldn't be fair to compare this movie to its predecessor, I will say that it finds its own path and resolution. There were tense moments as well that build between the two main characters Hodaka and Hina. I liked that as much as I did with previous lead characters Taki and Mitsuha. I was already at the edge of my seat with my curiosity growing and my mind left in wonder.Moral: In the blink of an eye, rain leaves that sense of wonder of what truly lies beyond our daily lives.The climax sure left me with a smile on my face. I recommend it.",Weathering with You
45,itsactuallyamanda,Weathering With Beauty and Perfection.,9,21 January 2020,"Weathering With You was a film that I only knew such little things about but I will admit, I myself do enjoy foreign films and I was very excited that this film from Japan and created by the always incredible Shinkai Makoto was arriving in the United States. So heading into this, I had very high expectations for this film and they did not disappoint at all.Weathering With You was a film that captured the essence and power of falling in love through an adventure-drama-fantasy film that left your heart feeling warm every second and at some points, made me cry with awe because it was just that amazing. But it wasn't only the story that made this film remarkable: the actors, the visual effects mixed in with an magical soundtrack made Weathering With You a film that uses real world examples (a country with constant disasters) and turns in into a film that if you ask me, should receive every single award in animation possible and is one that leave you feeling happy and give you an heartwarming feeling even after the film is over.I won't spoil too much here so all of you can go see the movie for yourself but I will say overall is thank you to GKIDS and Shinkai Makoto for bringing us an film that not only leaves us with many emotions but a film that we can watch for years and years to come and we will still feel all the emotions and love of the characters even after seeing it time and time again.",Weathering with You
46,MovieWarfare,"Too similar to ""Your Name"" but still narratively engaging",8,16 December 2020,"After watching the amazing Japanese animation movie ""Your Name"", I've wanted to watch director Makoto Shinkai's next work. The premise is simple and it's about ""A boy runs away to Tokyo and befriends a girl who appears to be able to manipulate the weather"". So is the movie another hit from the director or a flop?Let's get obvious out the way but the animation and art style is still absolutely gorgeous. There are so many shots in this movie that are visually stunning and is done with meticulous detail. The animation team somehow made the rain looks dazzling in different ways, sometimes foreboding and sometimes elegant, it's quite exceptional. There are a lot more supernatural elements in this movie compared to ""Your Name"" and these elements are magnificent to look at. Radwimps returns to do the music and it is still phenomenal here as well and the director utilises these Jpop songs at the right time and they hit the right notes.The characters are all great as well. The main leads are Hodaka who is a 16-year-old boy that ran away from home and moved to Tokyo, Hina who is a girl who takes part-time jobs to support her family after her mother's death and can control the weather. They meet each other by coincidence but end up tangled in each other lives. They are both lovable characters and the chemistry between each other is strong which leads to the strongest moments in the movie. I enjoyed watching both of them and following alongside them. The supporting characters are also great and also a lot more relevant and developed compared to ""Your Name"" making them stand out more. They are all distinct with their quirks and their struggles making them more memorable.So everything good in ""Your Name"" is good here but is the story still good? Yes, it is. There is a profound mystery ongoing throughout the movie about the constant rain happening in Tokyo, the weird ""fish jelly water"" floating around and Hina's weather power. However, the emotional core of the movie is the relationship between Hodaka and Hina which is what keeps the audience so engaged with the story. There are some very dramatic and heartwarming moments throughout that are genuinely touching. Additionally, the use of Japanese rituals and Shinto beliefs gives the movie it's own flavor that will set it apart from American romance movies.So is the movie masterpiece? Unfortunately, no as the biggest flaw of this movie is that it feels too similar to ""Your Name"" and not as good. It's difficult to not compare it to ""Your Name"" when that was his last movie before this. Weathering with You follows too many similar beats to that of ""Your Name"" with how similar the acts and structure are. It doesn't help that the movie also a romance movie and also has the same Jpop band singing within the movie. It probably would have been better if this movie was something completely different as people can't avoid comparing it to the masterpiece ""Your Name"".The movie also has some pacing issues as I feel it drags at times which is most prominent in the middle act. The movie could have cut around 5 to 10 minutes worth of stuff to improve the pacing so it feels more cohesive. It also uses a lot of cliches and cheesiness that are seen in romance movies especially in the final act which make the movie feel not as unique. Furthermore, there are a lot of plot threads still dangling that I feel should be answered such as why Hodaka ran away from home?, how Hina got her own house despite being young or why she has weather manipulation powers? and did Natsumi (a supporting character) get a job or not? It's weird to mention Natsumi is going through countless job interviews but failing and show it, only to not even bother to resolve it. Likewise, it's weird they don't elaborate much on the backstory of the main leads.Overall, it's a good movie but it just feels too similar to ""Your Name"". An interesting tidbit I've found about Makoto is that he wasn't exactly fond of the massive hype of ""Your Name"" as it made it difficult for him to live up to that hype for the next movie. Sadly, what he feared happened. I think it would've been better if Makoto did something a bit more drastically different and then comparing it wouldn't be so problematic. However, Weathering with You is still a visual glory with a narratively engaging story and likeable characters. Despite the lack of backstory for our main leads, we the audience will still have no trouble in rooting for them and wanting them to be together. It may not be as good as ""Your Name"" but it still went down a storm with me and I believe it would for you as well.",Weathering with You

Many people have declared it as below 'Your Name', well I think they expect too much from a guy who produced one of the best anime movie in history before. Nevertheless, 'Weathering with You' still works by using Shinkai's previous project: Blending the mundane modernity of human life with a magical touch of local myth, using the spiritful life perspective of a couple of teenagers, with their rebel behavior, their separation, and reunion in the very end of the movie. So yeah, it's a happy ending! Horayy!!!",Weathering with You

Soon, he meets Hina, who has an ability to control the weather. Taking the advantage, they both started doing business on this and continued until they realise that Hina's ability comes with a heavy price.Firstly, I feel like saying that the theme and the storyline are 'not' similar to 'Kimi No wa.' But the way the story progresses or the pattern you see will surely remind you of Kimi no Nawa and might make you feel Deja vu. In Kimi no Nawa, the main characters were separated by time, while in this one, they are separated due to weather. The ending was very satisfying and was brilliantly executed. The song Grand Escape was used at a very right moment. It manages to touch us or make us feel for the characters.The animation, the visualization and the soundtrack are even better than Kimi no Nawa. That may be because Tenki no ko is a more recent one. But if you have watched Kimi No Nawa, then you shouldn't miss this one.",Weathering with You

The cast in this movie is amazing everyone in this movie gives it there all yes I only saw the English dub version but the English cast and I'm sure the Japanese voice cast gave it there all to but man was the cast in this movie great.

Also the product placement was really distracting for me. Felt like a McDonalds commercial for a little while there. While there should be some signs for companies, etc (it is Tokyo after all) but they were just so prominent and distracting for me.

71,LansTaylor,I enjoyed it more than Your Name,8,23 June 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film more than 'Your Name' and I really liked 'Your Name'.
First off, the animation was incredibly done. The lighting and the water was very realistic and beautiful. The ocean in the sky was unique and aesthetically pleasing.
I read somewhere that the director, Makoto Shinkai, mentioned that this film is about climate change and how it effects Tokyo. I can see that but, I'm not sure what other deeper meaning he was going for? Was he also underlining that this was terrorist caused? In a few scenes we see on the LED board that there are terror attacks but I'm uncertain if it was cut for time. There could be an directors cut version that's a lot darker but who knows.
I had a feeling that 'Weathering with You' was gonna be in the same universe as 'Your Name' and that question got answered pretty early on in the movie because we get a cameo of the two main characters from 'Your Name'.
My favorite scene was when they were in the hotel. They seemed so relieve to have a place to stay for the night because they had previously been on the streets in the pouring and freezing rain. They seem so happy eating and singing karaoke together; it was cute.
Overall, I enjoyed this a little better than 'Your Name' but I feel like this will get unfairly compared to it's predecessor. If this had come out before 'Your Name', I think that it would've been better received.Also, that is the most perfect and deliciously looking Big Mac I have ever seen.",Weathering with You

I really loved the way he delivered the exposition scenes in the movie, it was really smart the way he did it and it was required because i don't think many people know about Weathering controlling Japanese mythology, even I didn't knew about it. The movie is very different and there is one thing I really loved about this movie is it makes feel that you are in that weather. When there was a sunshine, even though I watched this movie at night, it felt like i am watching it in a day.Actually, it was overall a good movie I think!

Perhaps because of the pressure of reality, I have long lost the courage to abandon all for love, all day long by the pressure of reality forced out of breath, but my heart is still envy those teenagers for love regardless of their own.
Perhaps in reality I can no longer achieve, can only in the movie, put their own into the teenager, let him go to replace his crazy.

Makoto Shinkai manages to make me interested in ancient stories that normally would make me want to sleep on my feet. Him, he manages to take me by the heart with a very beautiful love story and more in depth than in his previous film, it must be admitted! The director is comfortable with the subject of love, we feel that it is something that particularly touches him and that he wants to share it.
There is something really cool about the film as well: the realism. In addition to the realistic and very successful animation, even though it deals with topics that would be impossible in reality, it fits perfectly with the very down to earth atmosphere that the film set up.

I don't remember me this excited to watch a movie. We Indians never thought we could experience an anime in theaters until now, as you heard #indiananimemoment #indiawantsanime etc petitions to release anime in our country all those are paid off, thanks to PVR and Vkaao for releasing this movie in India and thanks to Makoto Shinkai for not disappointing a single bit and making our first anime experience such a blast.Like all films from Makoto Shinkai, the screenplay is not an easy one it has to say something behind it in this case about climate change, and what we are facing with current changing weather and disasters, especially for Japan people, understand more than others, really thought-provoking script in the grounded fantasy with the amazing coming of age elements, innocent romantic story and wonderful comedy. Two hours the movie never felt slowed down or rushed, no pacing issues, but in the third act, I wished just more depth to it.The film is gorgeously animated, the powerful visual is easily highlight of the movie. Every single frame is gorgeous especially sunshine scenes for me, rain scenes and whether manipulating or magic scenes really breathtaking we can see the production and work of all artists not wasted a single bit.Like previous work RADWIMPS for Your name, they did beautiful work in this one also, songs and musical score added weight to scenes emotionally, anticipation, entertainment and so in every wayIt has really memorable characters both protagonists finding there a place in the world learning to live individual life and falling for each other, other characters like his senpai and other female role have steals funny scenes. And when guest roles appeared in the movie, the whole theater was screaming!Verdict - Take my word and watch it surely you will enjoy and if you are Indian Otaku please support and watch in theatres.

92,300Megahertz,Not what it should have been,6,30 September 2020,"I don't know why this movie gets constantly compared to Your Name, if not for its creator, because these movies are nothing alike. Just wanted to get this out right away.Also it is often said that the peculiar weather phenomena depicted in this movie were some insinuation to climate change. Though some characters seem to confirm that with their remarks, it doesn't quite fit the narrative in which the weather can be fixed at will by a single person. If it is an insinuation, it isn't a particularly good one.These phenomena are never really explained. They are merely a weak plot device. And since the show focuses entirely upon Tokyo, the viewer is left wondering what the state of the rest of the world is (for example the home town of Hodoka).The protagonist Hodoka runs away from home. This is never explained in detail, making it very difficult to identify with the protagonist or at least feel sympathy for him. It's awfully contrived, and Hodoka acts mostly without any forethought. Bad start.Still, with the help of irresponsible strangers and by avoiding the police, he makes his way in Tokyo; and by a series of extraordinary coincidences, he meets Hina. Her background is just as bland as his and their relationship doesn't go very deep.On that note: There are no interesting characters in this movie. They are all one dimensional with one line of history. That's just wasted potential.In Your Name, fate was the enemy; here it is the police, apparently. The chase scenes, violence against police officers, and resistance are completely inadequate. But they needed that to create drama; in opposite to Your Name where drama comes natural. The solution of what stands between them (Hodoka and Hina), the clearing of the final obstacle, is way to simple and unsatisfying. Obviously I wouldn't like to spoiler, but I was left with: ""What? It's that simple? That's all he had to do? Why then even bother going through all this trouble?""Like I said: this movie is nothing like Your Name, but I wished it were.",Weathering with You

Those who knew had a hard time not being annoyed by the glaring similitudes. But I prefer seeing it like an attempt to rework its flaws:THE ANIMATION AND MUSIC ARE STILL TOP-NOTCH. I'll rewatch this movie with pleasure just for the soundtrack.the supernatural, which was yanking the plot whichever way every five minutes in Your Name, here takes a backseat to the story. This means the story has some time to breathe and expand, yay!the characters are better defined here! (with the exception of Keisuke Suga, the hero's boss, who switches sides more often that a weathervane in a storm. I guess he was supposed to be ambiguous, but he comes off as inconsistent)the romance is believable. We see the boy and the girl interact and their relationaship grow.Still, the plot feels like it's written by a 5 years-old. It's overly dramatic, in your face to the point of manipulative, but at the same time clumsy, with a weird reliance on a gun (!) as a plot device that's frankly off-putting.All in all, an improvement on Your Name.

This was still a very very enjoyable movie, I just wish they took all the real life political stuff out of it just like Your Name did. Environmental awareness, sure, gun violence, no, it is too sad to even think about. I wanted an escape from reality, not being constantly reminded of it.

They try to earn by solving the problems various sort of people have with the girl's magic power that can change the weather as she wishes.Then a weather disaster demands her life as a scapegoat like ancient traditions, however, so the boy absconds with her family to rescue her in exchange for the semipermanent flood in Tokyo.This film is thus classified as the so-called ""world-type"" category, in which even powerless underages are able to alter the world destiny. Contrast to Ghibli-related masterpiece works, Kiki's Delivery Service, Lupin the third, and Castle in the Sky are roughly corresponding to the first, middle, last part of this film, respectively. (I'm not sure if these films affected or not though.)Probable due to the experience of the coronavirus pandemic, I don't feel odd the sinking consequence of Tokyo and the last impressive message ""this world is originally insane"".Hence, this film can be recommended the people who have a strong interest in the current Tokyo. Visual narratives of sky views are also nice.",Weathering with You

The message delivered was strong, which in the end inspired the likes of teenagers to do what they think is right. The songs for this movie were all on point and the artwork of Shinkai senpai is as stunning as ever. The characters in this movie were all played to perfection, with some easter eggs from previous movies as well, remember to go search for them!

But this time the scenarios is a little bit superficial and the ending is obviously abrupt. In this regard I think Weathering with you doesn't reach the level of Your Name in 2016, which combines pictures, soundtracks and, last but not least, connotations, much better. The difference just shows us how important a good script is for an excellent animation. So is this a good anime worth watching? Certainly yes! Is this perfect? Obviously it could be much better.

109,Johnjronald-571-398268,"A for Effort, C+ in overall execution",7,17 January 2020,"Watched this film last night and while it is indeed visually stunning, I do think this is one of Shinkai's weaker films. It's better than Children Who Chase Lost Voices but not much else. The film commits the sin of telling rather than showing Hodaka's motivations for fleeing his island home--he felt stifled there, or something. We just have to take his word for it because we don't get flashbacks to judge this independently for ourselves. The narrative feels incoherent...is this a delinquent with a heart of gold story? A modern magical girl tale? It's hard to tell. I can't not compare it with other films by different auteurs...as far as the theme of Weird Weather, I feel like Penguin Highway is superior to this film. As far as the emotional connection to the characters...even the flawed film Fireworks (Hanabi) from 2017 does this better--I cared more. Your Name is Shinkai's crowning achievement to date, so perhaps it's asking too much for him to keep knocking it out of the park every time. I appreciate the clear effort he put into this film and the (somewhat) muddled message about climate change (again, see the anime series Shangri-La for a more direct treatment of this theme)....but it just didn't quite land for me. I appreciate that Shinkai once again allowed himself to have an arguably ""happy"" ending (many of his early works serve up bittersweet disappointment & regret)...though of course it we are to believe the magical narrative Hodaka basically condemns the rest of Tokyo to worsening climate by stealing away the magical sun priestess from heaven and the (invisible) gods will have their apparent revenge! Or else Hina and Hodaka had a really bad drug trip and boy doesn't climate change stink for everyone because adults can't get their collective shizz together to do anything about it. It seems to be one or the other, hard to see how it'd be both--but that's the muddled answer Shinkai seems to be teasing us with with a playful shrug & smile....the movie is definitely worth seeing but if you had to pick this or Your Name to watch for the first time, definitely pick Your Name.",Weathering with You

111,porkchopsnbutter,It's okay.,6,28 January 2021,This movie is incredibly beautiful. Tokyo looks like an animated photograph. My only animation is it's obvious when some scenes were rendered as 3D models. I don't like noticing 3D animation in my 2d anime. Other than that there's not much to say about it. It's okay. It's about as impactful as a 2-parter Voyager episode. It's a story worth telling with slightly higher budget and McDonald's ad cost than the average 30 minute episode.,Weathering with You

It will be very hard to produce a movie that will be up par with the expectations.In that criteria, I have rated this movie as good. It has its own character of melodrama and deep connection. The message of the movie about environmental conditions has been depicted.Although, violence can be found in some scenes. It can be attributed by reason of the characters age - teenage years. I find it a positive aspect of this movie - being so sincere and honest.If you are an anime fan, don't hesitate. This movie will make you feel the deepest emotions an anime can give.

That much is certain.I found it lacking in a weird way however... and it was when I watched ""Your Name"" that I finally was able to articulate what it was that just didn't work for me: the film has so much going on that it is often times difficult to see the forest for the trees. Sometimes the best stories are the ones that use what generous time they have to focus on a few key things and how those things live in the world that is created.Weathering With You has... well, a lot going on. I was charmed, and really did enjoy the plot, but I think if it had enough time to breathe it would have been a much more powerful film.

128,oyesusanne,Big Mac with You,7,21 January 2020,"It's raining a lot in Tokyo, day and night, and it's pretty cold, even though it's summer. Thrown into this uncomfortable world is the main character Hodaka, who ran away from his small island home to an independent life in the city. Tokyo turns out to be a very unwelcoming place for him, but he does find some help in Keisuke, a middle-aged guy without a good grasp on his life, and Hina, a girl that claims she can change the weather.The story that unfolds is not the strong point of the movie. There are too many strands and motives that don't really go anywhere, don't make too much sense or are just left unresolved.
Visually the movie left me very impressed. Makoto Shinkai movies are known to look great, but this one in particular presents a very honest, realistic depiction of Tokyo's urban beauty without relying on old visual cliches like neon lights or temples.
I'm strongly swayed by having seen what I like to see, but nevertheless I do recommend this movie, it's a good time despite its weaknesses.I wanna say a few more things about the climate change/natural disaster aspect of this movie. Even though none of these things are really directly mentioned, the intention is about as subtle as a punch in the face, especially for audiences in Japan, which has suffered several devastating typhoons and floods in the last years (and sadly fitting - again just two months after this movie was released). What is kinda left open to interpretation is the message (ending spoiler): We will not be saved by supernatural powers or egoism? Or should we accept our fate and try to adapt? Surely the drastic ending should be seen as a warning though, despite how happy everyone seems to be?",Weathering with You
129,dvdn-23120,Never let the rain stop. Let it flood.,10,22 August 2019,"(Context before this starts: I live in Australia and this movie was released in select theaters on the 22nd of August)I have been a fan of Makoto Shinkai since I watched his movie 'Your Name' in 2017, it being my favourite movie of all time. A timeless movie about determination and love, an atypical romance where lovers are obstructed to be with each other through time and space. Emotional, riveting, dramatic, intense and incredibly entertaining throughout. And one of the greatest worries for this film was that it would be too similar to Your Name. that it would be boring and unappealing.Weathering with You is not Your Name.We open to rain, a recurring happening in this movie, in Tokyo. The camera moves backwards through a window and we see a girl staring out. We then see she is inside a room of a hospital with a patient on life support in bed. This immediately sets the tone for the entire film, and the difference between Your Name. and Weathering with You. This film shows the viewer straight away that this film is not a happy film like Your Name. Where Your Name. has tragedy and death, Shinkai focuses more on the relationship between Taki and Mitsuha. It shows how their love will bring them together with themes of determination, culture and strength of mind. Weathering with You is somewhat cynical towards life. It shows the gritty parts of Tokyo with police brutality, underage prostitution and homelessness. The film is dark and morbid for most of the run-time, but breaks up the intense scenes with comedy or more hopeful moments.The direction from Shinkai is breathtaking and complements the art style beautifully. It works in symphony with the character and landscaping designs that you lose yourself in the film, starring in awe at what you see. I saw this film with my brother and no kidding there was a scene where our jaws dropped and we stared at each other before taking out our phones to screen shot it. The movie has multiple lingering shots on beautiful pieces which is just Shinkai saying ""I know you wanna see this, so I'mma just let this shot stay there for a couple more seconds..."" which I don't object to. The film knows it's gorgeous and it even improves its art style from Shinkai's previous works. This comes from mainly one thing. The rain. This has to have the best rain I have ever seen. Each individual rain droplet is painstakingly drawn with low fog on very surface, and the audio design of the rain on walls and glass in a surround sound theatre was incredible. It was very realistic and made me shiver on multiple occasions.This film, as I said, is different from Your Name. Aside from a recurring gag in that film, the movie is family friendly, little kids can watch and enjoy it as much as adults. Violence is only implied and no one is ever shown in pain. Language is tame and has one mild swear word, a few characters drink alcohol and one character smokes. There is around one intense/frightening scene with the meteor rush, and maybe you could count Taki's time trip as intense, but that's about it. Weathering With You is a contrasting film. This movie also has a recurring gag similar to Your Name. but it is called out and dealt with less seriously. This type of content is looked at more seriously, with women saying they have to sell their bodies to pay rent. This shows problems going on in current Tokyo where women are objectified by men and are used in terrible ways, especially for under-aged girls. There is infrequent but intense violence. Characters are beaten, shot at, slapped, tackled, one character sacrifices their life. Violence is not glorified, and the aftermath of shooting a gun has a character shocked and shaking in fear over what he had just done. A singular swear word relating to male cow defecation is said a few times by different characters and a light swear about someone without married parents said multiple times. A character is passed out with stubbed cigarettes next to him as he is riddled with guilt, and the same character is dealing with a nicotine addiction that he overcomes by the end of the film. This film has a many intense/frightening scenes, with the surprising chase through the flooding streets, characters coming to terms that if they want to be happy then one of them has to die and a long section where Hodaka is searching for the disappeared Hina where he breaks out of police custody, rides a motorcycle while avoiding police vehicles, then encounters his mentor whom attacks him and he pulls a gun on, police come in threatening to kill Hodaka when all his friends come in and stop the people trying to capture him so that he can see Hina for one last time, among others. In Australia, Weathering with You has received the age rating of PG which is recommended for children over the age of 12, but I believe that for the usage of quiet intense violence, difficult themes, some profanity, mild drug use and intense scenes, it deserves the rating of M for mature. Do not be fooled and allow little kids to watch this film, it is a mature film that is not suitable for younger people.Overall, Weathering with You is, in my opinion, another masterpiece from the visionary Makoto Shinkai. Realised, flawed characters written expertly, stunning art design and direction, surprisingly dark and intense themes and scenes, emotional moments, gripping action and a satisfying and beautiful ending. This film is easily the best movie that has come out this year by far, and I say that this movie is perfect.",Weathering with You
130,d_syboy,Not quite my tempo,3,29 May 2020,"It's great that there is diversity in personalities; in that people like it, and others don't.
I have many art friends that like his films, but I don't. And that's fine. If anything, society needs even more diversity.The music feels like it was winged, isn't truly mastered for the best music. The film style focus on it's sound effects and visual aesthetics, which doesn't even compare to ghibli's sound design or miyazaki flow/storyboards/directing. The characters live a life of having almost unrealistic expectations when it comes to romances. (Watch Comet (2014)) Not to mention uninteresting or cheap dialogueThe quality of animation isn't that much different from higher end anime episodes + inconsistency. The eyes aren't drawn very well and are inconsistent.
It is overrated in a way that many other great films are missed out from being given a spotlight to be watched instead; films that may become hidden gems. Perhaps the spot light effect is just from the lack of Ghibli films (imagine if there was a new Ghibli film every year or 2...)Want to see a great animation film you don't know of?

138,askarzhanaliev,"Good, but not best Shinkai movie",7,31 May 2020,"As always, Makoto Shinkai delivers in terms of animation, visuals, like shots of the city and weather, as well as great direction decisions. The art style is something that is not worth mentioning, since if you come to see Shinkai's movie, its always beautiful. I also do not find it similar to Your Name, although the themes of love, friendship and sacrifice are discussed in both movies, it is totally independent story.However, Weathering With you have not been an emotional roller-coaster as opposed to Your Name or even Garden of Words. I could not truly feel the same attachment to characters as in his last movie, and the comparison is inevitable. For this reason it is nowhere near to Your Name, but is still a very gorgeous animation.If you have never seen a Japanese animation or Makoto Shinkai's works, you would definitely love this one, but if you did, it would turn out a kind of disappointment.

I'll start with the animation and visualization in this anime, it's better than ""your name"", and it captures the metropolitan culture of tokyo's Japanese people very well, though i miss the depiction of japan traditional culture and rural area in this movie. About the music, they have similar aura with ""your name"", moving moments in the movie are captured brilliantly with the music. Storywise though, ""your name"" was a better love story than this movie, and ""your name"" made more sense than this movie.

Also, the non-descript Radwimps' music makes yet another useless appearance. Those guys are the Nickleback of Japan.I like this a lot with the above reservations. Anyone who watches an American remake of this should be shunned and lose all his or her friends.

152,lock2002,Disappointing for a Shinkai film,7,19 July 2019,"Now, don't get me wrong. It is still a good enough film to enjoy and a lot of people might even find this one great.But if you have high expectations after Shinkai's other works, especially the recent ""Your Name"", most likely you'll be disappointed.
I don't want to spoil anything, so this'll be as spoiler free and as short as possible.The visuals are gorgeous as always and the music is good too. But the characters and the story just felt boring and uninspired.
It felt like Shinkai didn't come up with anything really good or original and just did a formula rehash of ""Your Name"".
We have the same combination of boy and girl that have their issues and want to be together but are being torn apart throughout the movie because of *spoilers*. Then there are some fantastical elements and the same pop band performing rather repetitive songs if compared to their stellar song for ""Your Name"".
The songs for this film felt like Avril Lavigne or Nickelback, kinda good but unoriginal and they all sound the same.It felt like Shinkai was trying too hard to live up to his masterpiece, which I have no doubt is a terrible pressure for an artist, but once it's out there and you've outdone yourself, that's how it is.The ending was the worst part for me. Nothing gets solved, nothing gets explained.
While that can be a good thing, leaving the end and what follows up open to the viewers imagination, this ending wasn't anything like that. It just leaves you sitting there thinking what the hell?Another thing I really found cringy was the unnecessary and obviously forced depiction of japanese traditional and current day/pop culture.
I don't know who this is supposed to cater to (Anime/Japan fans? Japanese otaku? Viewers that want to be proud of their country?), but there were some scenes that just didn't make sense or had no reason to exist in terms of story or character development.
In one scene the female protagonist wears a kimono just because, then you get a shot of a sakura tree, the characters eating cup ramen from Nisshin as well as other japanese junk food saying how delicious it is, they're showing a love hotel, them watching fireworks, doing a little bit of Karaoke, the list goes on and on.
It felt pushed and unnatural like a commercial for Japan.
That takeaway might just be me being overly critical, but you can show japanese culture (traditional and modern) without forcing it. It needs to fit the narrative and the characters, like the scene fairly in the beginning where the male protagonist crashes at a manga café for a while to save money, otherwise it will just feel weird.
If I want to watch some random boring ""Cool Japan"" slice of life moe stuff, I can pick any tv anime that is out there and don't have to go to IMAX.In the end ""Tenki no Ko"" is still a good movie by normal standards but by Shinkai's standards and the new high he set with ""Your name"", this one is just average.
I'd like to give it 6 points from a Shinkai perspective but that wouldn't be fair.
Thus all in all, setting aside my strong personal emotions, this movie is still a strong 7 in my opinion for the general viewer.If there's a film festival near you that's showing this or other 2019 anime films or if you're in Japan and understand Japanese and you want to go to the cinema to watch an anime movie, I'd rather recommend ""Ride your wave"" by Yuasa Masaaki.
That movie was better in so many ways.
It's difficult to compare movies, of course, but because these two have similar themes like love, loss, water (I know xD), mixed with a fantastical element, I think a comparison is applicable.
Also, that movie made me cry which doesn't happen often. 😉
Or you can just watch both if you get the chance.
But don't watch ""Kaiju no ko"", that movie's second half made me want to get up and leave.What is up with all these water themed anime movies this year anyway?
""Lu over the wall"" last year already reminded me of Ponyo, but apparently that was just a taste of what was to come this year.
I mean, did they all write off of each other?
Were they stuck in the same taifun together?
Do they all love Ponyo?
Did they lose someone to water?
I don't know what's going on but this year's theme in japanese summer anime movies seems to be ""Be water my friend."" 😜",Weathering with You

156,midorixo,"beautiful, endless rain",8,19 January 2020,"Honestly, who translates these movie titles? what is 'weathering?' humph!
i watched the subtitled version, and the animation was equally as gorgeous as 'kimi no na wa.' there was an interview with shinkai after the preview screening where he explained the difficulty in animating rain: tracing the path of each drop, accounting for refraction, and having to draw things twice - the actual person or object as well as its reflection.
the musical score is once again the result of close collaboration with radwimps. sometimes scenes were animated AFTER the songs were received, which seemed unusual.
the story of 'tenki no ko' (child of weather) is closely tied to japanese people's relationship with the four seasons. there are folkloric elements that are hard to convey, but it's a visually gorgeous film.",Weathering with You
157,solahuddeen,Shinkai's departure from his wheelhouse.,8,11 September 2019,"Tenki No Ko has a very linear structure which if compared to its predecessor Kimi No Na Wa, will be seen as a much smaller, less grandiose of a film. But that is not a point to discredit this breathtaking piece of work as the writing and execution of that straightforward narrative is ever so excellent. I don't think a synopsis of the story would add much to my review here, so i'll just get to the gist of what this film makes me feel.This film is quite the departure from Shinkai's usual over-the-top romance. If you have seen this film, you might think we're not watching the same movie LOL. The reason i think as such is because this film moves past the common theme of individual longing which is evergreen in past Shinkai's films. This is the first film where the characters are faced with actual consequences for their actions that are done out of love. I find this growth to reflect Shinkai's own growth as a filmmaker who might just have grown out of the angsty romantic era of his own. The characters in this film are depicted to be very mature and independent for their age which can be seen in the 2 main characters and a side character as well. The film does even more with these characters through some adorable bonding scenes which to me, puts familial values instead of romance at the forefront. The common theme of family is also echoed by the side characters who adult viewers might find more relatable which is rarely the case in Shinkai's past works. This further cements the fact that Shinkai is entering a new era of filmmaking and I'm more than happy to wait for more of his projects.",Weathering with You

I was stunned by looking at all those beautiful animations. Really you can't do the same with live action. The CG used in fireworks citywide scene was particularly amazing. Animation and music in this movie were perfect.
Although I couldn't stop and compare it with other Makoto Shinkai films. Although this film is good but it is not Your Name or 5 cm per Second. You can certainly enjoy the film, it is packed with comedic and thrilling scenes.

164,gtacollectoryt,Great but not better than Kimi No Nawa (lots of spoilers),8,17 August 2019,"Kimi no nawa in my mind is a solid 9, and weathering with you is a solid 8, its still great but there are some things which irritates me and makes me just go ""why... just... WHY???"" , some HUGE spoilers are ahead though ill be as vague as i canThe Story (huge spoilers) :its good i tell you, the simplest backstory i can give is that the main character story are similar, trying very hard to live & survive in tokyobut there is a huge, i mean HUUGE foreshadowing early on, and somewhere in the middle, there is another foreshadowing/explanation which IMO kills the element of surprise/twist, when the characters met for the second time she didnt hide her skill, she just shows it to him & he understands because of the huge foreshadowing early on.
moving on to the next bit
because of what both of them did, some stuff happens and after she was told by another character about something then she told him that ""something"" is happening to herreaching the climax of the story, he confesses to her, she ask his wish, she granted his wish but he changes his mind and blame himself for that ""wish"" and try to ""turn things back as it were""oh also i should mention that this movie plays a lot with morals during the climax, and its that bit which plays with your emotionArt/Animation
its very good and there are lots of attention to detail
but still, because the setting is on a capital city, there is not much creative freedom before it doesnt look like a capital city, unlike your name, which has more freedom because countryside, and the setting/weather, (i know right, very obvious),most of the time its gloomy and rainy but it fits the theme for most part of the movie (again obvious)one thing i hate the most is the cut to black with a ""long"" interval, because it tends to switch a scene which is bright AF without any fading, its blindingsound/soundtrack:
i like it, but then again its personal opinion by this point, it fits the ""gloomy&rainy"" style of the movie but your name OST is better & more memorable IMO, sound design in pretty much excellent as i cant really see a flaw in it, like the visuals, there are lots of attention to detailfinal thoughts:
its a solid movie, the ending is pretty much a clear happy ending romance wise but a huge ""ummm"" for the consequences to get that happy ending and its kinda depressing but the side characters tries to convice the protagonist that ""the world is a crazy place"" and not their faulti kinda like this ending, its clear, not indecisive like your name,the shots of the city near the ending is a possible worst case scenario of what could happen if we just keep doing what we are doing and do nothing to try to change the global climate",Weathering with You
165,jloricav,A masterpiece.,9,3 September 2019,"Seeing the trailer for the first time, I felt like I was being played. I felt that this was going to take advantage of the hype that surrounded Makoto Shinkai from his last movie, Your Name (Kimi no Nawa). If so, then that would have been a scummy move on his part. I am glad that it did not come to that.Coming to the theatre, I had mixed feelings about even considering to watch this movie. The excitement for it clouded this movie like the rain in the movie. It hasn't been easy, since I wanted to watch it alone and out of biases for it.And actually watching it. Watching this movie has been a really tearful experience. Makoto Shinkai has changed the art of animation forever, and this movie has taken animated Japanese movies, or better known as anime movies, to a new set of levels that anime will have to capitalize on. The sound editing had been really, really topnotch in this movie. It actually felt like it had been dragging me into their world, and the soundtrack by Radwimps, ""Shukusai"", is really emotional, and that hasn't been easy for films to force tears out of my eyes. It made me feel like a child again.All in all, Weathering With You itself is flawless, with stunning imagery, a compelling plot, and topnotch editing.

I hesitate to call this ""bad,"" but the story is...rather average. I think I noticed this mostly because this is the same studio that made ""Your Name"", which had a complicated and interesting plot. In comparison the plot to ""Weathering with You"" is rather predictable and nowhere near as emotionally impactful as ""Your Name"". The plot isn't bad in ""Weathering with You"" so much as it's nothing special, and it doesn't feel like it measures up to the rest of the good elements about this movie.Overall, I'd heartily recommend watching this.

In fact, I appreciate the somewhat more linear story.But, Makoto Shinkai please please show some integrity, respect for your audience and love for your own creation and do.not.license.this.to.Hollywood.Please do not let them 'remake' it.Hollywood remakes of Japanese animation are unneeded, tacky, embarrassing, basically a rip off of the audience and so pathetic I cringe.

There is love, loss, regret, and most importantly an abundance of patience displayed throughout the movie. No one is perfect, and Shinkai makes sure to highlight this.

Makoto Shinkai You're Best Anime Director",Weathering with You
180,keaglez,"Enjoyable, weaker than Your Name but still a strong Makoto Shinkai film",9,25 August 2019,"The animation of this film is nothing short of amazing. Makoto Shinkai has proven himself again that he can produce the best animation in the industry. Aside of Ghibli (that currently producing the last Hayao Miyazaki film), only Studio Chizu (Mamoru Hosoda directed film) in my mind that can produce such high quality animation. Studio Ponoc is another notable studio that can produce Ghibli-esque animation, but their former-Ghibli director, Hiromasa Yonebayashi, still wasn't able to direct a hit since his time on Ghibli with Arrietty.Tokyo scenery has been a staple in Shinkai works, but this time, he made it rains, every single day. A high quality rain drops and water animation is then inevitable, which Shinkai deliver really well. This is a quality as good, if not better, than Ghibli's Ponyo. Every single drop of water is amazing to look at. Background animation is still as amazing as ever with Shinkai, but since his last hit, Your Name, his character animation is also now as good. I still enjoyed Ghibli and Mamoru Hosoda character better though, but Shinkai's are very close behind now.The signature of Shinkai works are the emotion, the heavy emotion like being afraid of losing someone, is still here. But unlike Your Name, there isn't such a mindblowing twist happening, so don't expect one. Still, the build up and the climax is pretty much great.For me, Shinkai really excel at making realistic story, but not as good at making fantasy. When the last time he made fully fantasy film (Children Who Chase Lost Voices), I found it to be lackluster. However, Shinkai found the perfect formula with Your Name, still realistic but with a bit of fantasy mixed-in. It's evident that Shinkai want to repeat the same formula here, but this time the fantasy part is even a bit heavier. This, ultimately, became the weaker part of the film.The fantasy part of Weathering with You take a center part of the story, but unfortunately it's also not explained that well. All we know is a bit of urban story, from fortune teller and old people, which other people take as a joke. By the end of the film, it's still pretty much a mystery and we still don't know much about it, why it happens, what is the watery things and more. The film really only focus on the interaction between the two protagonist, it's always the Shinkai strength here, no doubt, but when the mystery is also this important, I feel that part isn't concluded well.I still very much enjoy Weathering with You though. This isn't better than Your Name, it's actually weaker, but still really good. I ended up watching this twice now, and surprisingly I was able to enjoy it as much the second time around, the funny part still get me to smile and I still feel the emotion of the character.Also it's quite fun to see a fully filled theatre for anime film. Besides of festival or special screening, this is a rare sight for anime film and I'm glad this film got the recognition it deserved. Another fun fact is that this film was set in the same universe as Your Name, with Taki and Mitsuha both appeared as cameo. So maybe the biggest question is now, will we see a Makoto Shinkai universe going forward? If that is the plan, we might finally be able to see why such weird events keep happening in this universe and I'd love to see it. :)",Weathering with You

Instead of just ""we are switching bodies and now I love you"", this story has a way more well-developed and grounded love story.A lot of people really don't like the gun. However, I really liked the mere existence of it. It upped the stakes of everything, and during the scenes where Hodaka uses the gun, you can feel how conflicted and confused he is. Heck, the camera angle also change to his line of sight when it is used to aim. Did it have to be a gun? Not necessarily. Could it not exist? Definitely no. He was desperate, dug himself into a hole that he cannot come out of, chooses to keep the gun due to this desperation and fires it out of desperation. That's a big reason for him to keep, use and drop the gun. These are all choices made out of desperation by Hodaka which resulted in devastating results. The gun didn't need a reason to exist, it exists because it's a symbol of what being overly desperation could result it. Though I'd agree if it was more organic, it would have been absolutely perfect.I realise I already have way too much to talk about before I even talk about the audience-dividing and debatable ending. Shinkai admits he was challenging his viewers, ""What would you do?"" The ending is somehow open ended yet the plot ends there for people who are watching this movie as pure entertainment. It's incredible to appeal to two different types of audiences that well.The general consensus I see is most people connect with this story very well, especially the Japanese who are repeatedly fighting severe natural disasters. However, this connection seems to be as strong in not just Japan, but Hong Kong. I'm from HK and this movie is the literal reflection of everything in our society. Desperation, the possible future, the violent conflicts, it's pin-point accurate. Shinkai tells us that ""This world was already messed up, so do whatever you feel is right!"" This and the lyrics of ""We'll Be Alright"" are literally imprinted into my brain. This is why I'm afraid when global audiences watch this after seeing all of these good reviews, they might be a bit let down because of this lack of emotional connection on the get-go.The amount of enjoyment you will get our of this depends on how much you like to think and how much can you relate to the environment in the movie. Watching it for pure entertainment will make you lose 90% of the enjoyment of the movie.",Weathering with You

When watching Weather with you from start to finish, watching as I sat alone in the cinema wondering why it wasn't filled to the brim with people. The animation far surpasses Your Name, the voice acting brought out all the emotions the characters were meant to fell during the movie, the ending satisfied every desire I wished for.
Hodaka Morishima voiced by Kotaro Daigo is one of the two main characters he was a perfect representation of the voice acting shown in the movie, proving that an animated film can bring all emotions to life. Hina Amano voiced by Nana Mori was the other main character, I couldn't ask for a better lead girl, every scene she was in never felt repetitive always felt like a new emotion was being used.The anime's animation was perfect every anime I have watched until now doesn't come close (except for Your Name) to the level of animation in the movie. With the main animation being rain they made it look so good. Another stunning part of the animation was the environment the movie took place in (the city.) The buildings all looked like what you would see if you went to Tokyo yourself.Shinkai wanted to make a masterpiece. Well, he finally made one.",Weathering with You

The plot still runs smoothly, and has a nice flow to it. But when it comes to comparing to Kimi No Na Wa, director Shinkai's last movie... This movie doesn't quite add up to the qualities that Kimi has. The plot is less complex compared to Kimi, because it only happens in one timeline. The emotional impact is also felt less. The story still has a hidden message about extreme weather, but I still can't spoil too much, so here's the conclusion:
Just don't expect you are watching another Kimi No Na Wa movie. So think as it were a teenage love story. Still a great tho.",Weathering with You

The content is easy to predict, the main story is about the climate change. Furthermore, the movie has the cameo of two main characters in Kimi no nawa, it seems like this movie is telling us the after story of Kimi no nawa. The only thing i impress in this movie is the closing ending that makes viewers sastify. The animation 11/10, the animation of Shinkai's anime always impress viewers, it' smooth, great art, it's something that more than the word beatiful. And finally the music, it's great, but it's not good as the music of Kimi no nawa. I love the ending song 'Grand escape'",Weathering with You

Every inch of its art is detailed, the visuals and graphics are stunning, the voice actors did a good job, the sounds (especially the rain sounds) are well-done, plus the soundtracks that adds more excitement and feelings when played in a specific scenes, and of course, the story itself is outstanding. the plot is well-constructed and its concept is unique and refreshing. at last! the characters, hina and hadoko would be my favorites. they both did sacrificing for each other, that is why i love the both of them. your name and weathering with you have different concept, so, in my opinion: i can't compare these both masterpieces.this is one of my favorite films.",Weathering with You

However, weathering with you is no slouch either! The execution of the movie was breath-taking, with creative methods being implemented to portray the plot. The animation quality the movie boasts is a huge bonus too. Wouldn't mind watching it the second time. However, it has its flaws too. I feel as though the plot hinders the movie as the film logic is rather inconsistent and it has led me to believe that the story did not progress as smooth as much I would hope for. Adding the fact that the film lacks character development. Moreover, the ending raises unresolved questions too. Such as:*spoilers*1. There was a glimpse moment in the end where Hina meets Hodaka, but Hina is seen praying while the horizon displays a feint light. As a viewer, I'm quite puzzled whether Hina's powers were stripped off or not?
2. The future of Tokyo has no closure towards the endimo, I really wanted more for the ending, to see them two reunited and embracing more. But oh well. You won't regret watching this movie.",Weathering with You
204,batnator,Another stunning and mesmerizing work from Shinkai.,9,11 November 2019,"To tell how well Makoto Shinkai's Weathering With You lives to all the expectations of the phenomenal Your Name is not the right way of looking at the film - for what we are getting here is a masterpiece of its own. Complete with mesmerizing art-style and animation, a brilliant musical score, and a teenage love story which works so well, thanks to the skill full blend of crude grounds of reality with magnificent vistas of imagination - this film stands firmly as a gem of its own kind.Firstly, thanks to the numerous otakus, who helped in signing the petition to release this film in India - for truly the art of anime has many devoted followers here. And for us Indians, it was a moment of extreme joy when all our prayers payed heed in compelling the show-right owners to release this film in various cities across the country from 11 October - distributed by Vkaoo. The funny thing is that I was never an otaku or a strict follower of anime; even I can easily count the number of anime's I've followed entirely in recent memory - and the numbers are pretty small. However, watching Your Name was a turning point - the artwork, music and especially the story was so brilliant and heart-touching, that to this day the memories of the film makes me emotional. That made me open to anime-movies at large and Shinkai's work in particular.
Talking about the movie itself, it really lives to the expectations, to be precise. The skill of the Director in discussing a topic such as changing climatic conditions in Japan in the seamlessly stunning concept of a Sunshine Girl who is able to manipulate weather and potentially cease the incessant rains which are flooding the lanes of Tokyo - while humanizing the whole plot by a heart-warming teenage love story between high-school runaway Hodaka Morishima and the orphan, Sunshine girl Hina Amano is beyond praise. While there are plenty moments of real good humor sprinkled throughout the film - the film covers some dark aspects of life. The psychology of Hodaka's leaving his family and native town to find space in the seemingly larger world of Tokyo layers on some really serious topics of depression and suffocation that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the teenagers of our society - and the potential missteps they take which seldom lead to a most unfortunate, dark future. That being said, the film in specific leans on the interaction between the two teens - and how their relation develops while the pair earn money, praise and some unwanted attention in the job of clearing the weather by Hina's powers on demand. The main supporting cast too has its good share in the film. Their character development is also clearly well worked upon, for they play a key role in shaping the world and carrying the plot naturally. Speaking of which, the film has references of previous Shinkai films. To how much extent? That, perhaps I won't like to spoil ... but fans who will see those parts will definitely be awestruck for a moment - like I was. The voice actors for the film have given really commendable performances - particularly the voice actor for Hina, Nana Mori. Japanese rock band Radwimps returns to provide a sensational soundtrack for the film, along with 5 songs. Each of them was a joy to hear, and like Your Name before, was wisely utilized - keeping in mind the actual mood of the film and its characters at the moment - intensifying the strong emotions of a particular moment - rather than intervening in the actual story-telling. The artworks we've seen in any Shinkai film till date has been far excelled in this rendition of a rain-flooded, modern city of Tokyo. There is a subtle balance of hand-drawn artwork and CG effects in providing the perfect rendition to the world, the characters and the weather. Add to this the creative genius of Shinkai's masterful storytelling and the seemingly perfect music and songs by Radwimps and you get something that really can't be expressed in mere words. And this is where the film is the strongest - producing an extremely powerful outburst of emotions in the viewer by the juxtaposition of brilliant art design, touching music score and immersive story moments.
So, in conclusion, the anime community is getting another excellent work from Shinkai to dive into and enjoy. However, the brilliance of the film can't be merely taught to someone who has never been in to anime movies - in any number of after-thoughts and reviews - and only can be perceived when one actually sees the film. For the strong sense of emotion the movie offers to give is what makes this movie special - for creating those exquisite, escapist moments and making you believe in it - in its capability to absolve you in the movie and to make you laugh, frown, smile and cry. That is the power of any Makoto Shinkai film, which is again at display here - the power to gift some truly emotional moments which you'll carry on forever - which elevates the movie from the generic tag-line of being a ""mere anime movie"" which caters to only one particular kind of ""stereotypic audience"" and no one else. So I humbly request all non-anime followers too - once, just once suspend your disbelief about these kinds of movies and watch it with an impartial mind - and then you will realize that not everything is what it merely looks like. For it's a film to not to see, but to feel - an Art for Art's Sake - nothing more, nothing less.",Weathering with You
205,shirobaigg,A summary of the movie without ending spoilers,9,21 November 2019,"This movie brings back the feeling of the story of a romance that the previous firm 'Your Name' gave me, but the plot is different. Both movies having the same director and the style remain at teenage lovers, how and what they have to overcome the hardships they face together in order to be together in the end, but the world is fill with supernatural phenomenon and sometime leads to sacrifice taken in order to see the other half. The most heart toughing word he say to the girl is ""I'll choose you over any blue sky"", indicating that the boy is willing to sacrifice the world just to be with the girl.
Its starts with a girl in a hospital sitting beside women on a bed. During the time there was heavy rain, but there are a ray of small focus sunshine on a rooftop and the girl left the hospital and ran to the rooftop and found a shrine. She pray as she cross the shrine and the rain stop and sunshine appear. But something happen, she felt that she's floating in the sky, transparent flying fish is beside her but she is not sure where she is.
Next, we see Hodaka Morishima, a high school student ran away from home to visit the city of Tokyo. While travelling there, he almost fell off the ferry but he is saved by a man-call Keisuke Sago who gave Hodaka a name card and offer him if he needs help, just contact him. He ended up calling him after failing to find a job due to Japan's law against underage workers. This is where he meets Natsumi Sago, Keisuke's niece who he is mistaken for a mistress.
During the period where Hodaka was job hunting, he met a kind young girl who works at a McDonalds who treat him to dinner, he remembers the warm kindness given by the girl. One day, Hodaka encounters the girl intimidated into working at a sketchy club and rescues her. They had some arguments but end up being friends, her name is Hina Amano. She showed her powers to turn the weather to sunshine and he realises that she's the 100% sunshine girl.
They came up with a plan to provide sunshine with the cost of some money to make a living as Hina is an orphan and Hodaka is a runaway. They heard the pleased of the people and brought sunshine all around Tokyo that brought smiles for the people. But her power comes is a great consequence that was foretold that if the sunshine girl; which in this case Hina, uses her power too much, she will disappear from this world.
One day, Hina was being interrogated by a police officer in the search of Hodaka due to him possessing an item that is being searched by the police as well as his parents filling a missing notice to find him. They also stat they are minor without adult supervision, therefore they will be taken away by a social worker. They do not what that life therefore three of them ran away.
After many close calls from the police, they settle in a hotel to spend the night but something tragic happens to Hina. But during the time Hodaka has noticed, the police has raided the hotel and capture Hodaka into custody but he manages to escape and rescue Hina with the help of Keisuke, Natsumi and Hina's younger brother.The movie does not relate much about the life of Keisuke, on why he chooses to take in Hodaka during his time of need and why he decided to convince him to not keep running away from the police. What was he thinking during the visit of the police officer, why he shed a tear and what was the thing trigger him to go against the law and aid Hodaka? We can see that Hodaka reminds Keisuke of himself in a way as said by his niece Natsumi, and I can see that Hodaka words of wanting to see Hina one last time were the changing point that reminds Keisuke wanting to see his wife for one last time as well. He ran away to Tokyo when he was a teen and found the love of his live in Tokyo.
We can see that the necklace on Hina neck is the bracelet which her mom wore during the opening scene, this can mean that she has taken up the role of being the mother of the household to make a living to support her and her brother. She faked her age and resume to get a job and even went as far as being an escort to make a living. She only mentions her mother once in the movie, and it was during her last job with Hodaka before they decide to take a break.
It is known that Japanese Animation always likes to relate their character names with the characterises of them. If not mistaken, Hina means sun or day with (hi) means sun or light, (na) means green or tea. Not to mention the translation of the Japanese movie name means ""The Weather's Child"", indicating that Hina is the child that the weather has given birth and the child is Hina during the time she walks across the shrine. Hodaka means Sail and height, he did run away from home by sailing in a ship to reach great heights in his life. There is more meaning in their names but this is the important factors on what the director choices the name for the characters.
Overall I find this movie to have a good flow with a character relating the scene before and everything links up piece by piece as well get into the movie. We can relative what is going on in the firm to our everyday life, wanting to escape the boring life we have and exploring the beautiful world around us. Even with all the supernatural things happening in the movie. Would recommend people who like high school romance and into the culture of Japan as well as their mythology.",Weathering with You

I was beyond pleasantly surprised to see that this movie not only reached my expectations but went far beyond them. The plot, the characters, the musical score, the gorgeous visuals, the thematics of the movie, all of these made it the best movie I've watched in theaters in a very, very long time.
As far as coming of age stories go, this one has them all beat. Without spoiling anything, I found that the movie managed to capture a delicate balance of being grounded in reality while also keeping a profound connection with the fantastical, commenting on the romanticized views we have on love, society, and sacrifice as a whole, and contrasting them with a harsh, yet thoroughly enjoyable world.

I can definitely see why people prefer the other movie and I can see how they are similar, but I enjoyed the very beautiful, youthful plot, and somehow found more enjoyment in this movie.

213,vincentvidalberthaud,A great work with many messages between each of its layers,9,21 June 2020,"A solid 8/10, even 9/10. This movie falls short behind Your Name regarding the quality of the scenario and how - of course considering this movie's laws of physics, supernatural etc - realistic it is regarding its own logic (think of it as like how normal it is for a Kamehameha to exist in DB, well in this movie even though there is supernatural stuff etc, some things feel forced or aren't logical). It also has a few more ""unnecessary childhish parts"" (but that's my opinion, some people probably love them and I'm perfectly fine with that).However it really stands above Your Name in terms of the messages it conveys to the spectator. I still need to get my hand around them because there are a lot of them in this movie and they are a lot more complex that what we'd think at first glance. A theme that has a lot of fame nowadays in Japanese movies is the critique of today's Japan, and this movie is no exception (I am not saying it is a bad thing). That critique is divided in dozens and dozens of smaller critiques in this movie, each being unique and questioning a particular thing on its own regarding society, especially the Japanese one. And like I said there is a lot more than just a critique of society (there are a lot of reflexions on love, parental relationships, Japan's moral codes which as we can see can be clearly outdated and yet still in use, etc).I am sure that with a second watch, even a lot more stuff can be understood, grasped. And it can be crucial for anyone because from just watching it, even a young adult like me learned a lot of new things, values. So don't feel lazy to go for a second watch if you liked it, and write down what you think you learned from it. There are seriously life lessons in this.As always, well done to Makoto Shinkai and all the incredible team of artists, technicians and others who worked with him.",Weathering with You

This is my favorite anime movie which says a lot because I've seen some of the other favorite such as Your Name and A Silent Voice. Which I would both put around the same area. I watched this movie with 2 friends of mine and one of them was being annoying the entire movie and I somehow still enjoyed this work of art. Out of 250+ anime, this made it to my top 10.",Weathering with You
226,sgod-37200,Must watch it,10,26 August 2021,This movie is little bit emotional and some parts funny too.I like this movie must watch it ❤❤,Weathering with You
227,SubShin,I had higher hopes from a Shinkai film,5,7 July 2020,"After a masterpiece such as Your Name and other beautiful works of Shinkai, I had high expectations of Weathering with you. At least in my country, the movie was hyped a lot and was aired in the biggest IMAX cinemas pushing out Hollywood movies in favour of Weathering With You. I was happy to see that mainstream cinemas was starting to open up for anime, however what a disappointment Weathering with You was. Such a shame with such a huge opportunity to make anime more mainstream, possibly making way for other anime artists to get into the big screens, and make anime an adult experience and not just reserved for kids and family.Animation and graphics, backgrounds and the whole graphical aspect of the movie is without a doubt some of the most beautiful in the industry. Nothing to critique here. However the story, oh Lord what a mess.What I love about Shinkai's other works is how humane the characters are, how they react like real people like you and me. I like how you can identify with them and I love Shinkais common themes of distance, longing, loneliness and love which we all can identify with more or less. In Weathering with you however, there is absolutely nothing you can identify yourself with. The characters are 2D, no real depth. No thinking that it's pretty weird that a girl is connected to the weather. It's all normal? In Your Name the characters freaked out, we understood what happened was very weird and unreal... In Weathering with you, everyone sortof just accepts, which would never happen in real life.And I guess that is the problem with Shinkais Weathering With You - he moved into the fantasy genre which is very saturated already in the Anime industry, especially with Miasaki. Shinkai's other works, while still touching fantasy, it was still somehow kept ""real"" to not lose touch with reality, like Miasaki can do in his movies. Weathering with you lost completely touch with reality. In some way it reminded me a lot of Children who Chase Lost Voices.Shinkai has always been my absolute favorite anime creator. I hope he won't go deeper into the fantasy genre with his next works and come back to reality and creating stories and characters which touches us and we can relate to, something he's an absolute master at. But, sadly, not in Weathering With You. Not a tear was shed, which is unusual for a Shinkai film. We want to be moved and touched, it just didn't happen.It can be watched for the beautiful animation, but I wouldn't waste money to see it in the cinemas. Wait for it to get on Netflix or other streaming platform and watch it a rainy afternoon.",Weathering with You
228,indrek-7,"Beautiful artwork, weak story",5,22 December 2019,"Pros:
Visuals are really beautifulFirst half of the movie is captivatingCons:
end is confusing and dragging out too long.voice acting is often over the top, doesn't feel natural. Not uncommon to Japanese movies.",Weathering with You
229,red_yankeez,Got a goosebumps,10,25 August 2019,"As a fan of makoto shinkai's movie, this one you should consider to watch it on a big screen and you wont regret it. The music and the animation are one of the main ingredients that can be enjoyed for the rest of the movie. The plot? It depend on your taste, me personally like ""kimi no nawa"" more than weathering W U. But trust me, i dont wanna say much here. Just go watch it while its still on the theatre, and you can thank me later.",Weathering with You
230,darkchronicle_94,Loved it,10,29 September 2019,"Amazing songs, story and animation! Goosebumps are over me when playing all the amazing songs, I just cannot get over it after watching it, the feeling is still there even after 1 day. Going to watch it again!",Weathering with You

Never thought this much people will come to watch an anime movie and they were not wannabes or 1st time anime watchers who were just AWESTRUCK WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL AND FANTASTIC VISUALS.They know the importance of the techniques, technology,small details and hard work the people put in to make THIS MASTERPIECE.",Weathering with You

237,Pattykane,This movie touched me,10,14 January 2021,"I made an account just to comment on this movie. I was a huge fan of Your Name. I loved it, but I may very well love Weathering with You even more. The story between the two main characters was heartwarming to say the least and the rest of the cast is so genuine and likeable. I can't guarantee you'll like this more or as much as Your Name the same way I did. But I think any fan of that movie, and any casual anime fans as well will appreciate the amazing story, animation, and characters.",Weathering with You
238,mysablearab,I adored it.,10,23 February 2020,"I was introduced to anime and manga via my college-aged daughter. It was something she was interested in, so I went with her to see Weathering. It was the most beautiful pieces of animated cinema I've ever seen. I'm not usually one who watch a movie dozens of times....but I would gladly watch this again and again.",Weathering with You
239,mrmupikpl,Possible competitor for Your Name?,10,23 July 2019,"The relations between are very similar; art style, sounds and visuals etc, some say it is a continuation but you shouldn't see it that way. Shinkai felt as though Your Name wasn't a finished masterpiece yet it was too late to change anything, although being a hit of 2016. Given the time needed/wanted, Weathering with you is a different story of its own kind and deserves to be so, watching through comparing it to other titles from Shinkai or A Silent Voice is a mistake from the viewer. Give the film a shot and be in for a surprise!",Weathering with You
240,heylondon,A beautiful tale of what it's like to be in love,10,22 January 2020,"I loved this movie because to me it's a beautiful metaphorical tale of what it's like to be in love.It can start off with a simple, kind gesture-and before you know it, you're spiraling into a world of mystery. Love is something we grow up hearing about, but nothing can prepare you for its arrival. It's like a beautiful sunrise, starting off with blushing reds and warmth, slowly enveloping you until you're helplessly soaked in sunlight.When you're in love, you find a new sun to revolve around, and as much as you can, you want to bask in its light. As you unravel as much as you can about each others' pasts, futures, and destinies, all of the unknowable and unexplained can be daunting. But along the way, you learn that you don't need the answers to everything, the present and your feelings can be enough.The world around you seems to change and it's not something that's easy to explain. Like trying to convince someone that she's the reason the sun shines, words don't seem vibrant or intimate enough to describe the experience itself.With time, your relationship evolves to a point where many other relationships have ended. You're asked to commit and to sacrifice. To leap into the unknown. To give up what you have for an unsure future. Logic only points away, but the heart pushes on. You offer up your fears and doubts because you trust that person to be your sunshine, even if it rains for the rest of your life. Even though they have the power to break your heart, you fearlessly leave it in their hands. You defy destiny and deny countless futures for one together. It's scary and worldchanging, but it's beautiful and it's worth it all.When the world floods and the rains keep pouring, you know that all will be well, because she'll be there, weathering all of it with you.",Weathering with You
241,snah_13,An amazing animation... with nothing at stake,6,18 January 2020,"First the good parts. Amazing animation and great detail of Tokyo. I have lived in Tokyo for 7 months and I felt like I could really recognize the locations. The music was great and it made me feel strong emotions...
but with that said I think that without the music I wouldn't have felt anything really. The story is very thin and simple and nothing really seems to be at stake. No real antagonist, no real problem to solve and honestly I didn't get to really connect with the characters so the relations seemed over the top and very forced.I really left the theatre with an ambiguous feeling seeing that there where so many great elements in this animation, but it really lacked a proper storyline or plot and therefore it seemed too long and forced.",Weathering with You
242,mathiasseier,beautiful new animation movie,9,14 July 2020,"Would give it 8,7 not because it isn't good enough but the only reason for not giving it 10 or at least a little higher is that there is a lot of CGI compared to some of the older japanese og korean animation movies.
other than that nothing much bust is a must watch if your in love with Asian animation series and movies.",Weathering with You
243,ayama-42196,Great,8,11 August 2019,"I got goosebumps most of the time by music, pictures, the way to draw rain and tears were beautiful.
Some funny scenes, and also I almost cried when Hodaka met Hina over the clouds after Hodaka sorrowed Hina's lost.
I was surprised when Hodaka bought a ring to Hina's birthday. They are matured even they are teenager. Or am I too childish?haha I guess teenagers theses days are like that. I hope not.I really want to see how Tokyo would be, like when heavy rain came to Tokyo enough to cover bridges and some areas. I cannot imagine.",Weathering with You
244,chenyuanyuan-34199,A thought-provoking movie,10,5 August 2019,"Living in a country that are constantly hit by all kinds of disasters, Japanese people are more sensitive to natural disaster related topics than most other countries. Shinkai Makoto aptly captured this sentiment and made this heartfelt movie. Blue sky (aozora) is what everyone's heart desires when it kept raining and raining in Tokyo. However, there is a price to pay to get the sunshine back ...
Now with global warming getting increasing worse, people all over the world are dealing with all kinds of unusual weathers. This movie thus does not resonate with the Japanese, but also with me as an American. There is a strong message there, and the ending is ... I cannot spoil too much here. In any case, don't just take it as a teenager love story.
And needless to say, Shinkai Makoto's graphics is as breathtaking as ever. I like the songs as well.
I am glad that we can see it in American movie theaters next year. Thank you GKIDS!",Weathering with You
245,fabrizio-20907,One of a kind,8,18 January 2021,"""Weathering with you"" was truly charming and inspiring. I grew up in Germany. A country which is known as grey, rainy and dead. So I could relate a lot to this movie. It feels like the sky and it's atmosphere is connected to the body's spirit. And this movie showed it.
Great music
Nice animation
Nice characters
Very very nice dialogues and nice quotes
+ the German voice actors are casted perfectly.",Weathering with You

247,andrewgonzalez-86937,its a metaphor!!,10,22 June 2020,"Seriously, I understand if the movie was too wishy-washy for some people, i get it, But it is a metaphor For maturing or growing up like the book ""the catcher in the Rye."" It's so painfully obvious in fact, That they include two Scenes Where they flash the book itself That the boy is reading At the very beginning Of the movie. Yes it was only in frame for approximately four or so seconds, But with the two back-to-back shots they showed of it, It was basically eight seconds of ""hey-look-this-is-the-theme-of-the-movie-its-almost-like-it-was-deliberatley-placed-there-for-a-reason-hmmmmmmmm"". I'm only passionate about this movie because It only made me cry three times every time I watch it, Yeah I know, A measly Three every time I watch it. And for those people where it literally fly past their head what the purpose of the movie was, The idea behind praying is that you wish with all your heart that this will happen or that will happen, And that truly selfless people Well wish for other peoples wishes, Or truly malicious people Would Amplify anger and resentment. if My two cents matter at all, Is that I wish this movie Gets the recognition that it deserves just like ""the catcher in the rye.""",Weathering with You
