0,Leofwine_draca,Creepy doll movie is pretty effective at what it does,6,24 December 2016,"THE BOY is another example of the creepy/subtle/old-fashioned 'ghost story' genre that is now back in vogue with the likes of THE CONJURING, SINISTER, and the INSIDIOUS movies. These go back-to-basics in their approach, eschewing gore effects for more old-fashioned jump scares and general foreboding and creepiness. I find them slightly overrated - the older classics of the genre such as THE UNINVITED and THE HAUNTING are by default much better - but THE BOY is one of the better ones of recent years.It helps that the story is fresh and simple. The photography is good, with Canadian standing in well for olde England. WALKING DEAD star Lauren Cohan brings her typical understated professionalism to the part of a nanny employed to look after the son of an elderly couple who discovers that the son is in fact a life size doll. Yes, it's creepy doll time again, and while I didn't find the doll in the least bit scary here, at least it looks suitably effective.The setting is a decent one and Cohan keeps you watching without going over the top. Some of the roles, such as Rupert Evans playing the random love interest, are pretty clichéd. THE BOY is notable for featuring a massive plot twist at the climax which turns the whole story on its head, but I didn't mind it too much; it's not how I would have seen things play out had I written the thing, but it's done quite effectively here.",The Boy
1,SnoopyStyle,nice little horror,7,4 February 2018,Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) takes a job as a nanny in a remote english country mansion. She is surprised when the elderly Heelshires reveal the boy to be a life size porcelain doll. She needs the money while avoiding her possessive boyfriend. She decides to take the job. She is left alone with the doll when the couple leaves for their vacation. Caretaker Malcolm (Rupert Evans) occasionally visits and he tells her that the couple had lost their son Brahms some 20 years earlier.It's a nice little ghost story for the first hour. It's a bit of a throwback until the movie turns into an action thriller. This is a small horror but it's effective. Cohan does a nice turn into believing the supernatural. It's all very nice and easy old fashion indie horror.,The Boy
2,claudio_carvalho,Surprisingly Good,7,9 October 2018,"After the traumatic separation of her boyfriend Cole (Ben Robson), the American Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) flees to London. She is hired by Mrs. Heelshire (Diana Hardcastle) and Mr. Heelshire (Jim Norton) to be the nanny of their beloved son Brahms. Greta travels to an old and isolated manor in the countryside and is welcomed by the old couple. She receives rules to be followed and when she is introduced to Brahms, she realizes that he is a doll. Soon Mr. And Mrs. Heelshire travel on vacation and Greta befriends the delivery boy Malcolm (Rupert Evans). When she decides to give no attention to the doll, weird things happen and Greta believes there is a spirit trapped in the doll. Is she losing her sanity?""The Boy"" is a good surprise of the horror genre. The Brazilian title induces the viewer to believe that ""The Boy"" would be a rip-off Chucky, but it is not. Despite the flawed story that does not explains how the eight year-boy Brahms has survived and grow-up alone, the film entertains. Last but not the least, it is always great to see Lauren ""Maggie"" Cohan on the screen. My vote is seven.Title (Brail): ""Boneco do Mal"" (""Doll of Evil"")",The Boy
3,nogodnomasters,Why aren't you following the rules?,7,18 December 2017,"Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) is hired to care for Brahms at the Heelshire estate. She is surprised to discover Brahams is a doll. The Heelshires go on a holiday and leave Great by herself to take of said doll with a strict set of rules. Greta violates the rules and to her surprise the doll rebels as things and the doll don't stay where they were placed. Being overpaid, Greta develops a relationship with the doll. Malcolm (Rupert Evans) stops by to deliver the groceries and we discover Greta is leaving a bad relationship.The film had that same eerie factor of a doll moving that we, the audience has come to expect from Chucky to Robert to Puppetmaster to Annabelle. In that regard only Greta was surprised when the doll moved from one place to another. For much of the film, we were subjected to the been there, done that feeling. It wasn't until the last 10-12 minutes that the film grew and I started to love it.Makes for a good rental.Guide: Not much swearing. No sex or nudity.",The Boy
4,kosmasp,Oh boy,6,21 June 2016,"Or some boys never grow up. Which some would argue might have to do with the fact, that they aren't really boys in the common sense. But whatever you think of puppet horror movies, this has some things going for it. And it's far better than the Conjuring spin off (Annabelle), though that is not a tough task to be honest.We have beautiful leads (in the male and female department) and a very strange doll. A doll that seems to have a life of its own. Or does it? Well that is what we're here to find out. Of course someone could have warned the sitter about the situation, but where would the fun have been in her discovering on her own and laughing at the ""parents"" of said child? Exactly! Other than that we do have a suspenseful story that is being told, while not overly graphic. It received a 12-rating in Germany, which I think does apply well",The Boy
5,Sleepin_Dragon,You wonder if you're going mad or she is.,9,24 October 2017,"When an American nanny arrives in a British country home, she discovers she's paid to look after a doll.I am so surprised to see the relatively low score and number of negative reviews, I was really impressed by this movie, it was original, intelligent and kept me wondering through to the end. I can see why some would dislike it, those perhaps that were expecting a Chucky style film. In fact this film is a cleverly conceived, well crafted thriller. I appreciate some bits are far fetched, such as the ex boyfriend's arrival, and of course the conclusion, but as for being watchable I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second for fear of missing something.Well acted by all, this is a film I will definitely watch again. 9/10",The Boy

7,BA_Harrison,Variations on a theme.,6,2 October 2017,"American nanny Greta Evans (Lauren Cohen) travels to England to begin a new job looking after Brahms, the son of well-to-do couple Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle). Greta is shocked when it is revealed that Brahms is actually a life-size doll that the Heelshire's treat as though it were a real boy. When the bemused nanny is left alone with Brahms for a week while his 'parents' take a break, a series of bizarre events lead Greta to believe that the doll might actually be alive after all.For the most part, The Boy is a predictable but very effective chiller, the well-worn creepy doll motif resulting in some well crafted scares and lots of atmosphere, the viewer left just as confused about events as Greta. Are the happenings at the Heelshire house of a supernatural nature, or is there a more logical answer? After the steady build up by director William Brent Bell, one longs for a satisfying resolution—something really clever to take the audience by surprise—which makes it all the more disappointing when the truth is finally revealed. I'm not going to spoil it for you by writing what it is, suffice to say that the ending doesn't live up to all that has gone before.***Possible spoiler*** By complete coincidence, I viewed The Boy immediately after watching cult oddity Bad Ronald, with which it shares one big similarity.",The Boy
8,paul_haakonsen,It had lots of potential at least...,5,17 June 2018,"I found this movie on Netflix, read the synopsis and found it to sound interesting and appealing, so I decided to give it a go. Now, I do watch and like ""The Walking Dead"" quite a lot, but I just wasn't particularly thrilled that it was Lauren Cohan that was in the lead role, because she is not a particularly good actress in my opinion.""The Boy"" sure did have a good story, right up until the reveal of what is really going on. The movie was genuinely creepy up to that point. But then when it was revealed what was going on, it just all crashed hard and loudly.Good performances from a very small cast, so there was a lot of weight on the actors and actresses. The movie had a fairly good cast all round, and I must admit that Lauren Cohan actually stepped up here and had a more convincing portrayal of emotions and character here than she does in ""The Walking Dead"".The movie really had potential to become something unique, and it was well on the way, but then the entire house of cards just collapsed faster than you could blink.",The Boy
9,Quinoa1984,quite possibly the most absurd twist that I've ever come across,5,12 February 2016,"I'd like to start off by saying despite the 5 out of 10 rating, I do recommend this movie, for reasons that will be made clear if you decide to read this before seeing the movie...For the first, I'd say, 75 minutes of The Boy, you think you know (or at least I did) where the filmmakers are taking you... sort of. It seems like a kind of mashing together of the sort of English rural-secluded countryside of an older horror film like The Innocents (and that's to the movie's credit), and the 'doll is here and what is it *doing*) of Child's Play. I'm sure there were some other influences for this work - one of which I didn't know about until I was told of it much later on social media - but this starts off as a kind of batty (in a good way) horror story about an older couple who leave a woman (Lauren Cohan) in charge of taking care of Broms: a little 8 year old boy who happens to also be a doll. And nevermind that he's a doll - he'll need lots of comfort and caring to, such as reading to Broms and making sure its tucked in at night and fed and played classical music and what the hell is going on here?!This has an intriguing premise and I was kind of surprised by the quality of the filmmaking (at least for a January movie, when in recent memory you get schlock like The Devil Inside or even boring dreck like The Forest from the start of January), and the director and cinematographer and editor all pay attention to pacing and setting the mood and not really relying too heavily on jump scares, which are the death of horror cinema. There are a couple, but it's not the name of the game - it's more about 'where is Broms now, what is he doing, or what will Greta do next with this thing, and is it all in her mind?' It turns out the latter isn't true, and it seems like you can figure the movie out pretty easily... And then the filmmakers do something that is absolutely bat-s*** insane and turn everything on its head in the dumbest way imaginable. As it turns out (and this why I clicked 'spoiler' at the top), the movie really takes a lot of inspiration from a *1970's TV movie* called Bad Ronald (unseen by me, nothing to do with McDonald's fyi), which has the plot description of a perverted teenage boy who lives in the walls of a house after being left behind by his parents (who die) finds new people move in. Um... OK, that may work for that movie, but in the case of The Boy, the reveal of who Broms really is, makes for the craziest logic that I've ever come across for a mainstream horror movie - it combats The Village if you can believe it - and yet it doesn't really earn the brainpower to go back and think 'wait, how does that connect to this and that and... damn it.'It suddenly turns what's been a not great (there's one story hole with mail that I won't get into here) but interesting horror movie with a solid lead in Cohan into a nightmare. I don't mean that in any positive sense! In the last several minutes it turns into some later-period Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers flick, as Broms - the *real* Broms - has super-human strength despite living IN THE WALLS OF HIS HOUSE and still wears a Broms-doll mask over a hipster beard. It's so insane that you can't turn away, despite the jaw dropping past the floor and down the aisles to the bottom of the theater.",The Boy
10,BandSAboutMovies,Stay with this!,8,20 June 2019,"There's a moment early on in The Boy where you're either going to think it's the dumbest movie you've ever seen or completely brilliant. I err on the side of the latter, loving the audaciousness that demands that you believe that a porcelain doll could be alive. Director William Brent Bell brings you along for a great ride, keeping you wondering until the end who is really crazy here.Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan, Maggie from TV's The Walking Dead) has come to the UK from Montana to work for an elderly couple named the Heelshires. Thinking she'll be watching over a child in her role as a nanny, Greta is shocked that her charge is really a porcelain boy named Brahms.This is the point where you might want to give up on this film. I urge you to stick with it, as it gets really good from here on out.It turns out that Brahms has rejected many sitters, so Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire closes the doors to a room and begin speaking to him, asking if he approves of Greta. Now comes the time when they must instruct her on all the rules of caring for their child, which include always reading to Brahms in a loud and clear voice, playing his music loudly and always putting his food in the fridge if he doesn't finish it. Also: remember to keep setting and changing the rat traps outside so they don't get into the walls of the estate.Of course, Greta ignores these rules and does her own thing. While on the phone with her sister, she learns that her abusive ex - who she left the country to escape - has been looking for her. She also falls for Malcolm (Rupert Evans, who was on Charmed and is now on The Man In the High Castle), a grocery deliveryman.That's how she learns that when the real Brahms was eight - twenty years ago - he died in a fire. The real boy was also incredibly odd, which seems to be why strange things happen in the house: locked doors, stolen clothes and strange noises like the crying of a child. Even more frightening is that the doll is able to move between rooms on its own.Greta comes to believe that the spirit of the dead child is inside the doll, so she begins to take the rules seriously. This freaks out Malcolm, who relates a story that Brahms may have killed a young girl, but before the police could get involved, he died in the house fire. He warns her not to stay in the house, but she reveals that she had a miscarriage when her ex beat her, so she feels that caring for Brahms is her chance to atone.Do you think this film is crazy yet? It gets even more bonkers, because the Heelshires - happy that they've finally found someone worthy of their son - write a goodbye letter before drowning themselves.Of course, her ex-lover finds her and smashes the doll. But that only means that this film unlocks the next level of insanity because Brahms has been alive all along, living inside the walls, his ruined face covered with a mask that resembles the doll. The letter from his parents reveals that Greta is to be his mate. Can she escape? Will anyone survive? And how the hell are they going to top this in the sequel?Originally called In a Dark Place and starring Jane Levy (Evil Dead and Don't Breathe) before the switch to the title of The Boy and recasting the lead.I recommend this one, as long as you keep an open mind and accept that its ridiculous premise will lead to some major scares later.",The Boy
11,Coventry,"You have been a bad doll, um Boy, Brahms!",6,26 February 2018,"In all fairness, using dolls (porcelain dolls, mannequins, ventriloquist dummies, ...) in horror movies is almost like a quick win. What I mean by that is that dolls already look scary and menacing from themselves, and if you then film them from certain angles or play around with lighting effects and add a creepy musical score, it's as good as guaranteed that people will refer to it as ""truly terrifying"" or ""scary as hell"". Finding a good and solid story that connects with the dolls is what's proving difficult in most cases! I must have been in a generous mood when watching ""The Boy"", because I dug the story and even tolerated the many clichés, stereotypes, abrupt plot twists and grotesque finale. Greta, a young American woman, travels through the rural British countryside on her way to start an au-pair/nanny assignment she accepted. She arrives at a spooky old mansion and learns that her employers are bizarre elderly folks, but that's the least of her concerns! Greta must babysit an eerie porcelain doll, named Brahms, while its ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" go on holiday to the English coast for the very first time in their lives! Assuming the old folks are crazy and she's making easy money, Greta naturally ignores Brahms at first and disregards the strict list of rules she received, but via a few strange occurrences she quickly becomes convinced that the doll is alive and begins to take good care of him. Admittedly Brahms is a creepy little fella! The idea of a posh and bratty English lad reincarnated in a large porcelain doll is unsettling, and director William Brent Bell mounts the atmosphere and tension quite professionally, through a steadily slow pacing, good use of the old house filming location, hinting at the tragic events that overcame the real boy Brahms and the wise decision never to animate the doll or make it move individually. Certain story aspects are dreadful, like the clichéd appearance of the ""bad boyfriend"" for instance, but I reckon also inevitable to insert at least a minimum of body count. In other user-comments, I read that most people severely dislike the plot-twist that occurs in the third act of the film, but yours truly actually appreciates the rather brute change in tone & pacing. The twist makes sense from a narrative point of view, considering what we previously found out about what happened to Brahms and his parents, and at least it provides the film with a good dose of more than welcome action and speed. Lauren Cohen gives away an exceptionally good performance; - even one of the best I've seen in horror films from actresses of her generation. The Brahms-doll looks creepy, but as mentioned at the beginning of the review, I don't really consider that to be a great achievement. The dolls & puppets in movies like ""Poltergeist"", ""Annabelle"", ""Robert/The Curse of Robert the Doll"" and ""The Fear"" looked scary as well, but the stories sucked.",The Boy
12,michaelRokeefe,Babysitting meets eerie pretense.,8,13 July 2016,"A young American woman Greta (Lauren Cohan) travels to the remote estate of a prosperous British couple (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) to become the nanny for the Heelshire family's 8-year-old boy. Greta discovers that the ""boy"" she is to look after is actually a life-sized doll named Brahms. The couple leave a strict list of rules to be used in taking care of the doll, that is being treated as their real son that died 20 years ago. Greta will have nightmares as she interprets events proving the doll to be a real flesh-and-blood boy.This eerie tale builds slowly, but erupts frantically. A better than you thought chiller. This mildly disturbing film was filmed in British Columbia, Canada and has the proper atmosphere for suspense. Also in the cast: Rupert Evans, Ben Robson and Lily Pater. Brahms is played by James Russell.",The Boy

14,utgard14,Just another haunted doll movie? Not quite...,5,8 May 2016,"Lauren Cohan plays an American woman who travels to the UK to take a job as a nanny, only to find out the child she's supposed to be taking care of is actually a doll. She's also trying to escape an abusive relationship, which figures into the plot late in the movie in a really unbelievable way. Honestly, a lot of this movie's plot is unbelievable but you stick with it because Cohan is likable and you are dying to know what the deal is with the doll. When the truth is finally revealed, you'll likely find yourself laughing instead of being afraid. It's an entertaining enough movie of its kind, by-the-numbers up until the ridiculous twist. But the twist being ridiculous at least gives you something to remember the movie for. Otherwise it's kind of forgettable.",The Boy
15,oscaralbert,People fear sharks because the latter seldom sleep . . .,8,26 January 2016,". . . and dolls are frightful entities for the same reason. Apparently Greta's mom never taught her NOT to strip down in front of a boy doll, and the consequences of her wanton disregard for the niceties of proper decorum Young Ladies Must Know bring havoc to the Hillshire Home in THE BOY. Honestly, what American Girl would conduct her first tryst in plain sight of her Ken Doll?! But Greta is from Montana, where the sheep ranchers don't have time to teach their daughters the Facts of Life, as the TV police drama CSI: NEW YORK taught us a few years back. The bottom line is that NO amount of tax-free cash should be enough to entice a Proper U.S. Female to ""humor"" a demanding male plaything, no matter how much ""in control"" of her situation she thinks she is. Kow-towing to a tyrannical toy amounts to the first step on the Trail to Insanity--or worse.

Meandering and familiar thriller involving a haunted doll with beguiling Cohan as a hired nanny of sorts for an elderly eccentric couple's 'child' - a boy in the form of a spooky doll. Cohan's mix of intrigue and innocence makes her character full-fledged (as well as an expected back story as to why she continues to stay in her new situation). A few new slants in the script by Stacy Menear and able direction by William Brent Bell keeps the fairly predictable plot chugging along with some nice twists and John Willett's impeccable production design conveys the eerie atmosphere intact perfectly so.",The Boy
17,anaconda-40658,"Boy, Did This Suck!",3,3 February 2016,"The Boy (2016): Dir: William Brent Bell / Cast: Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, Jim Norton, Diana Hardcastle, Ben Robson: Nothing is as painful as the loss of a child. In this film we have an elderly couple who take it a tad further with the loss of brains. Lauren Cohan of Walking Dead fame stars as Greta. She arrives at this castle of a place owned by this elderly couple. She is escaping an abusive relationship that we are mainly told about through phone conversations. Anyway, her task is to babysit this doll while this looney couple go off and pond jump. She ignores all the rules because she sees taking care and treating this doll as a real boy to be about as idiotic as those instructing her to do it. As predicted strange things go bump in the night that point straight at this doll but the real kicker is a third act that makes little sense. William Brent Bell previously directed such crap as Stay Alive and Devil Inside. Here he has a cool big house to show off. Cohan holds her own as this woman who is slowly losing her mind. Other characters are about as lively as the zombies she slashes in her series. Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle are given the thankless task of portraying this senile couple who cannot tell reality from fantasy. Rupert Evans plays the guy who brings the groceries and attempts to get into Greta's pants. Ben Robson plays her abusive ex who conveniently shows up and gets his ass handed to him by a doll (more or less). Well made but incredibly difficult to take seriously as a horror film because it should be accompanied by a laugh track to back up the ridiculous premise. Score: 3 ½ / 10",The Boy
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Somewhat decent effort when it matters,6,2 October 2017,"Arriving at a lonely English mansion, an American nanny tasked with caring for an elderly couples' life-size wooden doll comes to believe that he might be alive and tormenting her in the house, forcing her to come to terms with the deadly secret of the house.This one wasn't all that impressive overall. Like the vast majority of more modern horror films, the fact that the film is so tame and obviously based on appealing to a mass audience. The fact that it tries so hard to ensure that there's something to ensure no sexuality or even violence in the situation as there's plenty of situations that can allow for something to happen yet the self- imposed censorship here with its tame atmosphere is the biggest issue. Obviously, this is an issue for the scenes of her walking around in a towel but the large brawl at the finale really should've gone further with its violence than what happens here and it comes off even more so due to the lack of action until then where it doesn't have the chance to provide that. That is another problem here where it tends to spend so long on her behavior around the doll and what's in her head about the situation to the point of not really feeling like a horror film for large portions of time. Going through the motions with her normal tendencies towards the doll and all the duties that entails on the mansion grounds that takes up a large part of the first half here is not only not all that well- designed for scares but seems rather bland all that more obvious based on the actions beforehand, which all really holds this one down. There are a few areas that do work rather well here, mainly in the rather intriguing atmosphere built up here about what the stunning and somewhat creepy house here where it's Gothic layout and build certainly add a great deal to the possibility of the doll being alive. The scenes of them interacting as she goes against the rules which causes her to believe it's following her make for quite an atmospheric start to this one, and although it doesn't do much horror-based action it allows for a solid build-up to the finale which is where this one really shines. Once the boyfriend shows up and gets involved, the true twist of the film is revealed and sets this off on a solid, action-packed path with a solid series of chasing around the house which gives this some incredibly tense and thrilling confrontations in this section to end it on a high note. These here are what help this one overcome the flaws in the first half.Rated PG-13: Mild Violence and Language.",The Boy
19,FlashCallahan,Stop staring at me Brahms.......,3,1 May 2016,"Greta takes a job as a nanny for a young boy in an old fashion murky English village.Upon her arrival, she discovers that the child is actually a porcelain doll that the parents have been using as a coping mechanism since the death of their son two decades earlier.After the initial shock wears off, Greta decides to stay and work for the couple, but when she breaks a few strictly enforced rules of their ""son's"" care, she begins to suspect the toy may not be a doll at all.....If you've ever been one of those people who are scared of ventriloquist dummies, and the Anthony Hopkins starrer 'magic', you may be one of the few people who find this film a tad on the scary side.For everybody else, it's just another run of the mill quiet....quiet....quiet....bang!! film that has jumped on the Blumhouse bandwagon knowing that you don't have to show much gore to be scary, just crank that volume up, and watch the crowd jump.So we spend three quarters of the film with the nanny finding the doll in slightly different positions than before, and hearing some banging also.There is a sub-plot involving a grocery lad who may or may not be as he seems, but that soon gets forgotten about when Greta's estranged boyfriend has appeared to have stumbled from the Point Break set and act all gnarly for the final scenes.And those final scenes are just a cop out that take away any other relevant key scenes that have been part of the narrative.It's not an involving film, performances are a little stunted, and it's about as scary as finding some mouldy bread.",The Boy
20,trashgang,slow mover but not boring at all,6,18 April 2016,"Not your typical horror flick full with gore or red stuff let's even say some ghostly things. This is just a flick, like Annabelle (2014), about a doll.I can't really tell what it's all about but Greta (Lauren Cohan) appears as a nanny just to be surprised that she has to watch a doll. In the beginning nothing goes wrong but slowly she doesn't know if she's going mad or things are wrong with the doll. The acting is above mediocre and luckily for that because it's a slow mover. It wasn't that bad after all and it was great to see Lauren (Maggie from the Walking Dead) doing well. Not every geek will love this flick due it being low on everything but I must admit that it didn't bore me at all, you just want to know what's wrong with the doll.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Boy

When the child's keeper is left alone with the doll strange occurrences happen. The first two thirds of ""The Boy"" is a creepy ghost story. The two developmental characters push The Boy's story-line from a creepy ghost story into a Texas Chainsaw Massacre story twist. The rules were broken with the doll. I never saw the plot twist coming, and I usually do. A suspenseful last 20 minutes. Well acted, written, and crafted by the director.

22,deloudelouvain,Another weird doll movie,6,5 April 2017,"I don't know what it is that some people are afraid of when they see a doll, a mime or a clown but to me it has absolutely no effect. Certainly not a doll, how creepy it might look. My wife on the other hand is terrified by those things. So it was quite funny to see her scared while watching The Boy. The movie itself isn't bad and I guess people that are afraid for the obvious things mentioned before might score it a bit higher. For me it was just entertaining but I never had the horror feeling like I have whilst watching other movies in this genre. The cast isn't bad, the story is a bit weird but not bad, even though I could have had a bit more information at the end. To me it could all have been more bloody to make it more interesting but it's still an okay movie to watch once.",The Boy
23,KineticSeoul,It's a watchable horror flick,6,20 June 2016,"This movie is a slow-burn of a movie, especially for viewers that have seen a lot of horror movies. It just had all the similar formulaic creepy horror elements. If you have seen a movie about a creepy doll than you have practically seen everything in this except it's done in a slightly art-house manner. That is until the third act where the twist hits, which I gotta say I did not see coming. Now the actions of the female lead doesn't make much sense. ""Hmm creepy old people living in a creepy house with a creepy boy doll...Yeah let's stick around a bit and stay alone at night. Oh I think I saw the doll move and creepy things start up around the house. Hmm I guess I will stick around a bit longer"". You see where I am going with this, but they needed a plot device and the plot device being a woman doing things that doesn't make much sense at all. As a matter of fact just about everything about this movie just came off really far-fetched. But again this is a horror movie after all. Although there are horror movies that actually stands out this just isn't one of them. It's however a slow-burn of a movie but I still found it watchable. I thought the cinematography and few details were well done.6.5/10",The Boy
24,Hellmant,"I look forward to seeing a sequel, or two.",7,25 July 2016,"'THE BOY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A psychological horror flick; about a young woman that takes a new job as a nanny, only to discover that the child she's supposed to watch is a porcelain doll. The doll may or may not be a living boy, that haunts her. The film was directed by William Brent Bell (who also helmed 'THE DEVIL INSIDE'), and it was written by Stacey Menear. The movie stars Lauren Cohen and Rupert Evans. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has been mildly successful at the Box Office. I enjoyed it. A young woman, named Greta (Cohen), has been involved in an abusive relationship (in Montana). She takes a job as a nanny, in the United Kingdom, to get away. Upon meeting the boy though, she learns he's actually a porcelain doll. Apparently the couple she's working for, believe the doll is their son. When she's left home alone with the doll, mysterious things begin happening. The film is somewhat simple, and there's not a lot of action in it (or gore), but it is creepy (and even somewhat scary). I like the idea for the movie, and I think the filmmakers did a pretty good job bringing the story to life. I even look forward to seeing a sequel, or two, which the film is obviously set up for. I'd definitely recommend it to horror fans (at the very least).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",The Boy

I thought it was a pretty great twist but could have been executed better. For example, after the reveal I thought about it and put it all together. But then after he attacks her, they explain it and show how it makes sense, after I had already figured all that out.

Finding herself trapped in this perplexing situation, Greta learns from Malcolm (Rupert Evans) that Brahms is the physical manifestation of their real son who apparently died many years ago. But the truth is far more sinister than she could have imagined...The premise of an inanimate object, a seemingly harmless, dispensable item, that has no physical life, but does more harm than one can imagine, has been covered before, in films such as Magic and Child's Play, and it still holds some creepy potential. Sadly, The Boy, while too well made to be a complete failure, still has too many noticeable flaws that really stop it from being the sum of its parts.Director William Brent Bell manages to establish a fairly spooky atmosphere in the first half, and there is a genuine air of mystery to behind what's going on. Unfortunately, when we first enter Greta's predicament, we share her reaction and you feel more like laughing at the absurdity of it than being freaked out. Despite being generally well done, it fails to really all come together and produce an effective whole.The Boy isn't beyond redemption, but needs to be sent to his room for a bit to think about what he's done. **",The Boy
27,ThomasDrufke,Unnerving Pleasant Surprise for Horror,6,24 January 2016,"Perhaps revival is a strong word, but I really enjoyed watching The Boy. My expectations for horror films have significantly lowered especially after seeing the criminally clichéd The Forest earlier this year. The Boy is pretty generic and clichéd by its premise ""a girl, running from her past, is asked to babysit a boy, or a doll rather, and is left alone for weeks by herself in an old mansion that is extremely secluded from other homes."" Just by reading that I get the feeling a film like this would be filled with jump scares and unoriginal and boring characters. While the film does have its fair share of silly moments, its a refreshingly entertaining installment for the Horror genre.The Boy stars Lauren Cohan, from Walking Dead fame, who plays Greta. For the most part, the film is shrouded in mystery. The strong suits of the film lie in its secrecy. Much like The Forest a few weeks back, the build up to the reveal of the film is probably better than the actual reveal itself, though the ending is pretty great. With that said, as Greta learns to somehow grapple with the fact that she's babysitting a doll who closely resembles a boy who used to live in the house, the film grows weaker and weaker. The horror of the film takes a big rain check for the middle 30 minutes of the film.Dolls usually scare people for various reasons, and this doll is no different. The whole time you're guessing how and why the doll is doing the things that its doing and there were plenty of stupid ways to go about revealing that. The film does a good job at covering the reveal with multiple other clichéd possibilities that we all (including myself) believed it would be, thankfully the director went in a different direction. So in all, The Boy was a solid experience at the theater. Its not going to keep you awake at night like great horrors do, but I don't think it will disappoint either. I'm really glad to see someone from a prominent television show make a good transition and show promise for a future film career, well done Lauren Cohan.+Cohan holds her own+Creepy, unnerving moments+Jump scares are timely-Middle half takes a turn for the worse-Build up is probably better than the reveal6.7/10",The Boy

From the beginning when Mr. Heelshire tells Greta things are not what they seem and saying Brahms is there, you know there is more to the story than Brahms died in the fire. And it's pretty easy to guess when its obvious Greta is not alone in the house. Having the ex Cole arrive out of no where, just makes the plot ridiculous. How could he have gotten there so fast and found the right place.

However, we didn't realise that it turned out, he was stalking Greta at what she was doing to him and that we found out he was a serial killer all along! Man, you would really feel sorry for his parents. Crikey, it was so heartbreaking that they committed suicide together by drowning on a lake. I wish the movie concentrated on them too because I wanted to see if their bodies were found. I suppose they didn't bother to add more scenes, it would've been better but I think, the movie was more upsetting enough like.You would never look at dolls again seriously.

34,ironhorse_iv,"This mediocre dummy had potential at greatness, but end up being kinda dumb.",6,8 February 2016,"Originally titled 'In a dark place' and previously known as 'The Inhabitant', 2016's 'The Boy' is an surprisingly step up, for director William Brent Bell, considering his last widely released film was the universally loathed, 2012's The Devil Inside. Most general consensus see the American psychological horror movie as decent at best, however, for me, I saw it as below average. Yes, I like how the film is focusing less on cheap jump scares and more on the story, however, this Gothic horror is nowhere near watchable. First off, the dreadful story reads like a script going through a lot of studio interference. First off, the title for this movie is way too broad. There has been, way too many movies titled 'The Boy' in recent years. I don't know, why the studio thought the title 'the boy' would be better. It's clear, in how this movie flows, that the original story was written, sometime in the year 2011/2012. It match well, with 'The Inhabitant' title, however the studio change it, when the 2014's horror film, 'Annabelle' became a hit. Not only, did they forgot to change or update a lot of the 2011 original story, but there are plenty of parts, in this movie, that seems like they stole from the 'Annabelle' horror concept. If it wasn't that film, then it had to be from another 2014's film, call 'Housebound'. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, I'm glad, the movie had a quick pace. I just didn't like, how the movie move in a very incoherency way. It really didn't match the tone. Very odd character behavior comes and goes with the main character. Written by Stacey Menear, the movie tells the story of Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan), an American woman on the run from her abusive ex-lover, Cole (Ben Robson). She winds up in England and accepts a job as a nanny for an eccentric old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton & Diana Hardcastle). But the interview are apparently turn out, a lot creepier than it seems; for it turns out that Greta won't actually be taking care of a real boy, but rather a porcelain doll who represents Brahms, the couple's long deceased son. Rather than reject the job, Greta is grateful for the safe haven, the mansion provides, and the enjoyment, she gets from the flirtations of Malcolm (Rupert Evans), the local grocery boy. Unfortunately, the spirit of Brahms think otherwise of her visit. Her recent actions has violating a sacred series of strict rules of his, and now a series of disturbing and inexplicable supernatural events has come to make Greta's life, into a living hell. At least, whatever, a low-budget PG-13 rating can muster as scares, such as loud noises, and really pitch black scenes; which in my opinion, fails to scare me. The movie is so dark that you can barely see anything. The loud noises sounds very clichés and recycled. The movie is not overly gory, but characters do die. Not only that, but some of the supporting characters like Malcolm seem useless. Honestly, besides, playing Greta's love-interesting, there is barely any reason to keep him, around. I really, maybe, he would have a bigger part, toward the end. You know, be related to the twist. Sadly, he isn't. Even, Brahms himself, doesn't seem as scary as the film makes it out to be. I thought, the twist toward the end with him, didn't make much sense. After all, it's hard to believe, that movie thought, 1974's 'Bad Ronald' and 1989's 'Hider in the House' was a clever way to end the film. I also didn't like how much of a man-child, the movie makes Brahms is. Are we really suppose, to take Greta ordering Brahms to go to sleep, serious? This is the high level of nonsense. Remind me of the killer mistaking his victim for his mother scene from '1981's Friday the 13th Part 2'. Trust me, when I say this, I was really dumb. Another thing, that kinda bug me, is how Laura Cohan is playing an American nanny. I really don't see her as that type of a character. Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress, but I really don't see any sense of 'motherhood' with her performance, here. Also, doesn't it seem a bit odd, for her to want to take care of somebody else kid, after the recent miscarriage of her own!? I just, don't buy it. However, I was really hoping the movie would go, 1992's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, with this sub-plot. Sadly, in my opinion, the miscarriage subplot comes in and out of the film, way too often. I don't know, if she wants to be a mother or not, with her, trying to screw the grocery boy. Also, why is Laura Cohan still doing her American accent rather than her normal British sounding voice? I know, she's an American playing an American, but she does hold a British citizenship as well. Wouldn't her normal English voice, sound a lot better, here since the settlings is in England?! The reason, why I say this, is because I just don't buy the fact; that this American is flying all the way to England from Montana for a job that she doesn't know, anything about. It makes no sense. It make more sense, if she was British. Overall: This movie was very disappointing. If you want to see it. Its might be alright for you. However, this isn't a movie, I'm willing to rewatch, anytime soon.",The Boy
35,Reno-Rangan,When a nanny meets a boy who is a weird toy.,6,14 May 2016,"So this is the other 'The Boy'. The last year film was a thriller- drama, but this is a horror-mystery. It feels like watching a classic horror film, especially because of the English atmosphere and the house where it was shot. A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth. The dark secret comes out and that's the film.A limited cast film. The suspense was the key to the story narrating successfully. So I expected a big twist at the end, but it was a decent one and the overall film was just above average. The atmosphere was creepy, and then it weakened as the development was decelerated going to the second and the final act. Until the twist, it was good and after that a bit disappointing. Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple. Good film to watch for once, but like the most of the horror films, it's fallen short to get my thumbs up.6/10",The Boy

It seems as of late that a trend has circulated, particularly in horror thrillers, for unnecessary plot twists. The Boy unfortunately succumbs to that fatal error. Essentially, an American girl moves to England for her new job as a nanny. Unbeknown to her, she is caring a doll that the parents believe is their real son Brahms. She must follows the rules precisely because if she doesn't...well, little Brahms may not be happy. What an interesting plot this was! Not entirely original, but creepy films about creepy dolls being creepy are so damn infrequent these days that it actually felt refreshing. The first two acts were splendid. Plenty of dark lighting to create the moody atmosphere as our protagonist wanders around a humongous mansion...alone. Very well paced, slowly placing breadcrumbs to feed our minds with intrigue. Is the doll possessed? Is the doll actually a real boy? Why on earth is it made out of ceramics!? These people need to shop in IKEA. Plastic is the way forward. Anyway, all was going so well and then...we enter the third act. Why oh why oh why did they think the twist was a good idea? We've now changed sub-genres from the supernatural to...well I can't say without spoiling it but if you watch it, you'll know what I mean. All the mystery, the intrigue, the damn captivation...gone. Instantly. Diminished like it was someone picking gum off of their shoe. Look, I can see why they did it, and theoretically, in a far-fetched way, plausible. But no, no, noooo. Didn't work for me I'm afraid. The acting was serviceable though, I mean Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans were good. Although, there is no way she could've wrapped a towel round her and walk up steep ladders into the attic, be trapped there all night, come down and STILL have that towel wrapped. I smell lies.

42,jtindahouse,A decent attempt at a tired genre,6,7 April 2016,"I remember when the original 'Child's Play' came out, the filmmakers wanted to leave some mystery around whether or not the doll was the one causing all the trouble or whether it was the little boy. In hindsight, while the idea had merit, it made the film less effective and left us with a big chunk of the film having very little actual horror. 'The Boy' tries to create a similar mystery. We never actually see this doll move and yet it is strongly implied that it is moving off camera. Of course any astute audience member will be very suspicious of the way the film is trying to portray this to them, and rightly so. The film actually has almost the exact same twist as a recent New Zealand film 'Housebound'. The twist leads to a tense last 10 or so minutes but was it enough to justify all the build up?I often think when I see a dream sequence in a horror film used to generate scares it's a sign of a weak story. 'The Boy' has more than one and this is simply not acceptable. The mystery element of the film however is the best thing it has going for it. I didn't believe the doll was really coming alive but I couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly was going on. Even though I'd already seen the twist before in a separate film, I still felt it worked effectively here. There's not a lot of life left in the doll horror genre it must be said but if there was any this is probably the way to go about bringing it to life (so to speak).",The Boy

As far as it's spooky factor goes, I would say it's not as good as the Chucky movies but it is better than the ones about that Annabelle doll. Lauren plays an American that is hired to be a nanny for an English couple, Jim and Diana. The money is good and Lauren has personal reasons to get away from the states for awhile-someone is looking for her. The only hitch is that the English couple seem to be a little twitched in the head because their son, that needs taking care of, is a life-sized doll. It seems that the little boy, Brahms, died when he was 8 years old and his parents replaced him with a doll that looks like Brahms did, as an 8 year old. Now, 20 years later, Jim and Diana are going on a little vacation and so they leave a list of do's and don'ts for Lauren about how to handle Brahms-I guess he got his name from his love of classical music, you know, the Brahms Lullaby. Jim and Diana tell Lauren to follow the rules closely or there might be consequences. Of course, she doesn't and there are. Rupert is the local grocery delivery man that helps fill in information to Lauren about Brahms' past. He also wants to get to know her a little better, if you know what I mean. When the 'consequences' start to kick in-mysterious things start happening -the question is, is Brahms a ghost, an evil spirit, or maybe something even worse. It's not a bad movie but it could have been a little better. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.

48,parry_na,Recommended.,8,21 June 2018,"'The Boy' suffers from 'how American writers think English people speak', I'll get that out of the way first. For example, the grocery boy Malcolm (Rupert Evans) says things like ""I'm considered quite charming in this country."" Evans is encouraged to use a well-spoken but entirely region-free accent throughout. It's not a huge issue, and UK films are not always accurate in their representation of US characters either. If you can get past that - and there are far worse examples out there - then there is much to enjoy with this.Miss Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan), an American Nanny, travels to a gothic mansion to tend to the needs of an elderly couple's young son Brahms. It is difficult to escape the central storyline in the publicity - the fact that Brahms is a doll initially filled me with reservations. Could such a realisation be taken seriously? Andrew Jones' series of low-budget projects involving Robert the Doll is good, for example, but suffers a little when the prop figure is required to move.There was little need to worry: this is a cracker: restrainedly directed by William Brent Bell at least initially, and written in the same way. Greta is just as incredulous as to the notion of a living doll as the most cynical audience member, and yet when she has reason to be convinced if the reality of its existence, we are too. Brahms is a ghostly looking, handsome doll, sometimes very life-like and often lifeless, as necessary.Greta's willingness to care for Brahms is reasoned by a miscarriage she suffered at the hands of an abusive relationship with a character called Cole (Ben Robson). Cole suddenly turns up at the house demanding Greta returns home with him. He is, of course, exactly the kind of overbearing bully we want him to be - and then we can begin the business of desperately wanting some punishment for him. This is when the pace moves from slow-burning build-up to pure horror. When the resultant manifestation of Brahms reveals itself, the fragile build-up takes a step back in favour of Jason/Michael Myers territory; whilst this doesn't carry the same kind of emotional weight we've enjoyed so far, it is still effective. The finale explains things away and makes sense of it all, but there is a slight disappointment that the spell has been punctured with reality. As a whole, though 'The Boy' works beautifully, far better than I expected it to.",The Boy
49,GiraffeDoor,Bit of a dud but it improved on Anabelle.,5,3 August 2019,Although I sort of liked the first minute twist this was a meandering and flaccid attempt at a chiller with many bad habits and very annoying characters.Twice they do a dream fake out jump scare. It's that level of conscientious about respecting its audience.The cinematography and the atmospheric old mansion is wasted on this movie.I didn't find the final section as predictable as everyone seems to and I though it redeemed the picture partially.,The Boy

There are few jump scares used in the movie and are effective. The movie is not a clichéd pattern like Chucky or Annabelle where the doll is possessed and some priests will come and solve all the problem, but here the doll seems to be friendly. This is something unique and I liked about this movie.Acting is decent and Lauren Cohan did a tremendous job and had got a superb support from the supporting cast. Screenplay of the movie is slow but engaging and will keep you glued to the screen, climax of the movie is shocking with an unpredictable twist.There is an unanswered questions that why did the parents of the child committed suicide? Apart from this unanswered question the movie is decently engaging and will keep you glued throughout the end. A must watch.",The Boy
52,a_baron,The Boy,9,25 May 2016,"For a film with only seven characters - including a voice on the other end of the telephone - and basically one location, ""The Boy"" packs a punch. Greta is a young American woman who has applied and been accepted for the post of a nanny at a mansion in the English countryside at an extortionate salary. When she meets the parents though, she has a surprise. The mother is well passed child-bearing age, because their son Brahms died two decades ago, and Greta has been hired as nanny to a doll. She does her best to hide her surprise, and gets the impression the man of the house is humouring his wife. Greta takes the post promising faithfully to stick to the routine she has been given while they go off on holiday. But is she really going to nanny a doll? The parents' holiday is not all it appears, because they have no intention of returning ever; filling their pockets with rocks, they walk into a watery death. Meanwhile, strange things are happening in the house. Are we going to see the oh so predictable devil doll chasing her knife in hand? Not quite, Greta is a young woman with issues; unfortunately, one of those issues turns up at the house and attempts to persuade her to return home with him. By this time though, she has already convinced herself that because of her other issue, Brahms has ""chosen"" her. What happens next is reminiscent of another low budget film - one from New Zealand - but to elaborate on that would be to give the game away. Suffice it to say if you can forgive the nightmare sequences and the heavy poetic licence needed to bridge the credibility gap, this is one psychological thriller you won't be sorry you watched to the end.",The Boy
53,davispittman,A surprisingly great movie,9,31 January 2016,"I thought the boy was just going to be another one of those run of the mill cheesy horror films, but I was terribly mistaken. This movie actually is very scary and über creepy in many many scenes. The film was acted, and well casted too, all the actors really did fit their respective roles. And I was very happy that the jump scares weren't too over done or cheesy, they actually were pretty effective. The plot is so intriguing and well put together. The Boy really does pull the viewer in and makes you want more. This movie might not look like much from the previews or the commercials on television, but trust me, it's much more than you think. This movie is a really fun time for horror/psychological thriller fans. The script is also pretty well written, and the dialogue isn't cheesy or anything, like in some horror flicks. This movie is definitely worth a watch! I 100% recommend The Boy to everyone that is old enough to see it, and loves frightening thrillers. I also liked hoe they cut right to the chase, the very first scene is her arriving at the house to babysit, the filmmakers do not waste any time whatsoever. Sometimes that doesn't work, but for this one it did. 9/10 for The Boy. There's also a bit of a twist ending here, but I'm not telling.",The Boy
54,myriamlenys,always study parents and child carefully BEFORE accepting a job as a nanny,6,11 December 2018,"I thought that ""The Boy"" relied a bit too much on jump scares and tropes to be fully convincing. It was also too long : at least a quarter of an hour could have been cut without damage to the story, intrigue or mood. Still, it succeeded in creating a spooky atmosphere. (Congratulations to the persons who created and filmed that doll - it was seriously unnerving.)The movie also had some pretty unnerving things to say about people who have developed a hole in their self-esteem, for instance as a result of mistreatment or neglect, and try to fill the void through excessive and unreasoning devotion. Here you've got a young woman who, at some moment, throws herself body and soul in the care for a child/doll, but many readers will be able to quote other examples from real life. Many Roman-Catholic churches, for instance, are haunted by a lonely old lady who waters the plants (nice), who cleans and polishes and adorns the statue of a patron saint (still nice) and who is ready to go medieval on every impious soul daring to cough or sneeze within a thirty-feet radius of that particular statue (call the police).If you like tales about (possibly) supernatural dolls, I can recommend ""The Dressmaker's Doll"" by Agatha Christie, which has a nicely restrained British feel. This, in my humble opinion, is one of the best short horror stories written during the twentieth century.",The Boy
55,aidanratesmovies,"Not Bad, A Fun little Creepy flick",8,25 September 2020,"Although The Boy is a bit predictable at times, it has plenty of twists and entertaining moments to spare, even with more than a few flaws up its sleeve. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an enjoyable little horror romp, that is luckily very unique and original- rather than a copy off of the so many other doll horror movies we still see today. It has its formulaic moments throughout, even some eye-roll worthy ones as well, but luckily the film is able to pull together with a more than entertaining story to follow- and some wonderfully creepy antics. The performance from the lead isn't anything too special, really just a pretty face to cast in the lead horror role. However, Rupert Evans does give a rather good performance in his role as Malcolm, as well as Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle as Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire, although they are hardly in the film as much in comparison. In the end, The Boy is about as good as you would expect it to be, without ever being exactly what you expected. It's an odd, enjoyable, and rather fun little creepy film, and though it is far from perfect- I wouldn't mind catching it again sometime.

Of course then it starts to immediately jump into lame horror movie tropes.This is a frustrating movie for me. An interesting concept lost in a mess of tedium and cliches.

59,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Has this been sitting on the shelf since 2011?,5,3 February 2016,"Mediocre suspense/ supernatural/ Horror (the film cannot decide which it wants to be) has a bit of atmosphere in the ""Very lovely, very weird, large house"", as a pretty girl is hired by an elderly couple, to be the caretaker of their weird doll. In addition to the elegantly creepy setting, lead girl Lauren Cohan is pretty and can act, and the entire small cast does well, but the material doesn't consistently work, unsure if it wants to be a psychological thriller (is she just going crazy and imagining everything? How else can the doll move its own head while she is looking at it?) or a supernatural haunting (how else can the doll move its own head while she is looking at it?) or a slasher flick (as fully grown Brahms is revealed to have been living in the walls of the house for "" 20 years "").Confusingly, the story says Brahms died in 1991, which it says, again, was "" 20 years ago "", dating this film to 2011, which makes me think that was when this was written but the date was never changed, or this was filmed in 2011 and sat unreleased until 2016.The subplot with her stalker ex-boyfriend seems needless, possibly added at last minute to stretch out the runtime, before the climax goes off into The People Under The Stairs/ Friday the 13th Part 2 hybrid territory. Maybe without this subplot, and with a bit of editing, this could have worked better as a short story in a Tales From The Crypt- like anthology?Why did this elderly couple want to give this girl, or anyone at all, sacrifice to Brahms? Then commit suicide? Was this girl supposed to take care of him for the rest of her life, and if so, why her? And why on Earth does this film have a 3rd assistant director (who usually would handle extras in a large crowd scene?)Maybe I'm just over analysing here. Turn off your mind, and this might be a decent watch at a matinée, because the film has some good individual components, but it doesn't add up to as much as it could. Finally, I'm quite happy it didn't resort to the generic, predictable jump scare for the final second shot.",The Boy

Surely their inner demons will reveal themselves in a devilish unravelling of some dreadful secret? At one point I was hoping the doll would reflect the heroine's insanity, then hoping the doll would go all Asian horror. But no - it collapses back into its IKEA box with a tired, old twist to reassure its white-bread target audience.The lead actress is very good, and she could have carried a much more pervy role - you can feel her holding back. The hero is entirely unconvincing, but I think that's to do with the American-Brit mish-mash.Photography and direction are pretty good. Music is constantly on, telling us how to feel.Overall, when you deal in clichés you need to weird it up. Mediocre attempt.",The Boy
61,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Highly entertaining but fundamentally uneven and flawed, ""The Boy"" is a mish-mash of ideas that are fun to watch, but don't quite come together...",6,6 February 2016,"You ever watch a film, and at a certain point, you get the feeling that the final product is obviously a heavily edited (if not outright- butchered) re-working and simplification of an otherwise great idea? Like a studio-suit-type got their hands on a really cool and original script that defied convention... but then that same studio- suit got cold feet, and had a legion of ghost- writers re-work it into something more generic and ""audience friendly""?Yup. That's the feeling I got watching ""The Boy.""Don't get me wrong, there's still fun to be had. And despite its rather obvious faults, I was thoroughly entertained and had a good time. It's just... so obviously a great concept that feels like it's been tampered with by studio committees and producer interference to dumb it down to certain level that can only be described as ""lowest common denominator."" At times I could even swear that the film feels like it was the product of two or three different scripts that were haphazardly mushed together in a last- ditch effort to try and make it more of a broadly-appealing (aka ""generic"") thriller than a unique spine- tingler.The film follows Greta (the adorable Lauren Cohan), an American woman who has been hired to act as nanny for a prim and proper older couple's child overseas in the UK. However, Greta is taken aback after learning that the ""boy"" is actually a child-sized doll that is treated by his ""parents"" as if he was a real, living being. He's fed and taught lessons and kissed goodnight... a routine Greta is informed she must definitely follow. But when she begins to stray and ignore the rules set for her, strange things begin to happen, and it becomes all too clear that the doll might just be more ""real"" and ""alive"" than she could have imagined.The film works for the most part mainly due to the charm of the two lead cast-members, and for the well-executed visual storytelling.Cohan is a lot of fun as our lead, and she's a great choice for the role of Greta... she's able to convey her initial annoyance over her situation, the paranoia of her character as the story progresses, and even has a lot of really good pathos due to her fairly good development and backstory. And co-star Rupert Evans (probably best known for his roles in the delightful ""Hellboy"" and the underrated ""The Canal"") is charming as can be as Malcolm, a local grocery man who delivers food to the home and develops feelings for Greta as the story progresses. They're the main focus for much of the running time of the film, and they're both perfect in their roles, creating a lot of care from the audience.Director William Brent Bell also does a wonderful job in his visual storytelling, and he elevates the material. I honestly haven't been a fan of his work in the past... ""Stay Alive"" was a lazy and very condescending attempt to cash-in on the growing popularity of video-games over the last 20 years. And ""The Devil Inside"" was a terrible mis-judgement, with its infamous final act still viewed as a low- point in the world of horror. But here, Bell is actually able to get a lot of great work done, and show he does have the chops to make a good creep-fest if he really puts his mind to it. He revels in the atmospheric visuals of the old, enormous house and nearby woods. He glides the camera organically in slow, lingering shots that are a breath of fresh-air compared to the lousy ""shaky cam"" nonsense polluting other horror flicks. And he even for the most part strays away from relying too much on loud jumps and noises. I particularly admired a wonderful sequence where Greta tries to demonstrate to Malcolm that the doll can move on its own... great stuff there.It's just a shame that the film is dragged down so badly due to its issues with the script and storyline. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised that if at one point in development, the film was more of a psychological drama about an emotionally damaged person forging a deep connection with an inanimate doll... because this film's best moments- and indeed the moments that feel the most complete and developed- are the sequences where Greta begins to learn about what's happening and become more and more attached to the idea that the doll just might be alive. It's wonderful in certain scenes, and it feels disturbing in all the right ways. But then other sequences contradict this... particularly the scenes that play more as straight-forward horror. They feel like scenes out of a different film. And without spoiling it, the final act feels like it comes out of left-field in a very inorganic way... almost as if the climax from a completely different script was tacked-on and retro-fitted to feature the characters from this film. It almost gave me whiplash to see how much it changed in the third act.If they had just ran with the idea of a woman in a house being forced to take care of a creepy doll like a real child, and explored the ideas of isolation and paranoia associated with the situation... it could've been a great film. (Almost a ""horror version"" of the wonderful indie flick ""Lars and the Real Girl."") But the tacked-on scenes added to manufacture generic haunted-house thrills diminishes the impact... as does the frankly bizarre climax.Still, the performances and atmospheric direction make it worth seeing for fans of horror, and I would by lying if I said I didn't get a kick out of it.I give ""The Boy"" a slightly-above-average 6 out of 10. It doesn't quite come together 100%, but it's definitely a fun time.",The Boy
62,quincytheodore,"""The Boy"" benefits from atmospheric visual, hissing audio and twisting narrative to make it more alive",7,27 January 2016,"There's an appeal on how the movie creates an expectation to what kind of horror it may present, then turns it around with playful change in direction. It might not be all too shocking or innovative, yet the clever shift coupled with nice backdrop of quaint village setting serve as a nice foray into mystery thriller. It does however, possesses occasional conflicting tones that might undermine the tension from its enigmatic theme.Greta (Lauren Cohen) is offered a job on rural English and it comes as a surprise to her that the job entailed is much stranger than she previously thought. While this might seem like a deal-breaker, the money is good enough to make her stick around. After a short moment there she finds strange occurrences happening to her, some of which are alarmingly eerie.The movie is at its best when it provides a mysterious vibe. It makes audience wonder whether this is a supernatural haunting, a psychological breakdown or sinister curse. The visual for ""The Boy"" itself is ominously creepy while the audio plays a good role in creating the suspense. It's often the visual and audio clues that create a lingering sense of curiosity, perhaps even more effective than some of its actual scares.Its flaws reside on the tired occurrences of ""Is it a dream?"" gimmick, which accompanied by a couple of lackluster jump scares. This is also a movie with a small cast, while the actors perform appropriately for most parts, there are some moments where the change of tone seems too jarring and might even ruin the immersion.A few hiccups from the jolting pace aside, ""The Boy"" has assortments of amusing tricks and mysteriously creepy production to play with delightful horror.",The Boy

There's no such excuse here. The film rubs everybody's face in the creepy, from the off.So why did she stay?? Her internal monologue should have been as follows:""I don't care how much I need the money; the lady of the house just told me that she thinks a DOLL moved my shoes... I don't need this lunacy...

Greta saved the grocery guy after stabbing the real Brahm when he insisted on a kiss and became even creepier. They drove away and the guy brought the pieces of the doll together.

After a few minutes of setting up the movie, you become riveted to the screen and are eager to hear every word because you don't want to miss out on what is going on and what is about to go on. The plot and story allows you to focus because the premise is solid. It's about the doll and that is enough to make the audience susceptible to the whole concept as it unravels at a nice pace with some good goose-bumping thrown in.

Mr. & Mrs. Heelshire tell Greta that, Brahms is very particular about certain things & has a specific set of rules. These rules have to be compulsorily followed.

However, when she carelessly avoids following the rules bizarre things start to happen in the house. After a couple of unexplained events, Greta slowly starts believing that, Brahms might actually be real. The Boy is a great film! The atmosphere created by director William Brent Bell is ominous & sets the tone for a really unnerving experience. However, the film doesn't deliver what it promises at the start. There are several creepy set pieces in the movie but, none of the scenes in the film are terrifying. The jump scares in the film are so obvious that, the viewer can see them coming from a mile away. Despite all these minor flaws, The Boy is my favorite movie revolving around a possessed doll. It is way better than Annabelle(2014), which is the other most recent movie in this genre. The highlight of the movie is, the mind blowing plot twist in the end. Lauren Cohan is spectacular as Greta Evans. Cohan masterfully depicts Greta's growing vulnerability & desperation throughout the film. Rupert Evans is brilliant as Malcolm.

In other words, when you're doing things that other people would call ""crazy"", at what point do you move from ""eccentric"", or even ""weird"", to genuinely, certifiably using the clinical term ""bat-sh** crazy""? These are some of the questions you'll be asking about more than one character in the horror thriller ""The Boy"" (PG-13, 1:37). But you'll soon find out that insanity is only one possible explanation for the unusual behavior of various characters and the many strange happenings throughout this very entertaining film.Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) is a young Montana woman (around 30) who is restarting her life. To escape an abusive relationship with her former boyfriend, Cole (Ben Robson), she doesn't just leave him – she leaves the country. Greta gets hired as a nanny (a job she's never done before) by the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle), an eccentric older couple living in a big, isolated house in the English countryside. Unusual stuff, but things definitely move to weird-slash-creepy when Greta first sets eyes on her young charge. The ""boy"" that Greta is supposed to care for turns out to be a marionette-like porcelain doll. Greta thinks it's all a joke, but the Heelshires aren't laughing. They lost their son, Brahms (Jett Klyne), in a house fire on the boy's 8th birthday. They coped with their loss by starting to care for a doll which looks like their son and is about the size of an 8-year-old boy. They've been calling this doll ""Brahms"" and treating him like a real boy for about 20 years. Now, it's Greta's turn.After giving Greta detailed instructions regarding Brahms' care and leaving her with a clipboard containing a list of ten rules (and whispering a cryptic ""I'm very sorry"" as they head out the door), the Heelshires drive away for their first vacation in ""a very long time."" Greta is now alone with Brahms in that big wireless-less house. Her only contacts with the outside world are her friend, Sandy (Stephanie Lemelin), whom Greta calls regularly from an old rotary-dial phone, and Malcolm (Rupert Evans), the handsome young local man who delivers groceries and brings mail to the house about once a week.At first, Greta treats the doll as most of us would, tossing it aside and ignoring it. But the longer Greta ignores that list, the more strange things begin to happen in that house. Her clothes disappear. She gets locked in the attic. She finds a mess in Brahms' bedroom. She starts to hear noises and see shadows. Greta is creeped out and begins having scary nightmares about Brahms. Then, the doll starts showing up in places other than where Greta left him. When she calls Malcolm over to witness all this, and he sees that Greta is now treating the doll as if he's real, Malcolm starts to treat her as if she's bat-sh** crazy.""The Boy"" is very well-directed and pretty original. William Brent Bell (who also helmed 2012's ""The Devil Inside"") masters the slow build, making us wonder throughout the film who's crazy and who's not, as he gives us a few good gotcha-type scares along the way. His cast is better than in many horror flicks and they keep us interested during the times that not much happens. Stacey Menear's script keeps us guessing and then brings everything together in a mind-blowing twist that few will see coming and which shocks, without resorting to cheap tricks. This film skillfully blends some elements of earlier horror movies like ""The Shining"" (1980), ""Child's Play"" (1988) and ""The Others"" (2001), but has a fresh and even more modern feel to it. All aspects of this fun and exciting horror thriller are on target – from its creativity, to more technical aspects, such as its set, camera work, visuals and editing. Missing this movie, or letting anyone tell you the ending before you see it for yourself, would be kinda crazy. ""A""",The Boy
77,swilliky,More awful January horror films!,3,23 January 2016,"Continuing on the awful January horror movie tradition, The Boy takes on the haunted doll sub- genre of horror and stars The Walking Dead's Lauren Cohan as an American nanny hired by a deranged older couple to care for their son. The son just happens to be a doll and though at first Cohan's character Greta finds this odd, she still signs on for the job desperate to hide away and earn the excessive amount of money she will be paid.The Boy contributes to more awful horror movies. I'm not sure how this movie was produces, it seemed like such an awful idea in the first place. I'm such a sucker for these earlier year horror flicks though and find small enjoyment in the slow build. There were a few clever jump out scares and the mysterious grocery boy played by Rupert Evans, whose performance in the first Hellboy is one of my favorite in a superhero movie, kept me guessing up to the final third of the movie.

78,ghostfiendghost,a decent horror movie but not for me,4,6 February 2019,"You know this movie works better than the strangers because of a couple of reasons
The first is things do actually happen in this film and it has a story and a decent twist.
But overall the film is still slow, some weird editing choices and has some frustrating moments
works for some people but maybe not all",The Boy
79,tonypeacock-1,Cliched horror in the loosest sense!,7,18 August 2018,"I class this as a 'horror' in the loosest sense in terms of its low age classification that seems all the more frequent these days.
It follows most of the key conventions of the horror film genre. Style, score, lighting and editing wise.
The film has a mildly interesting premise as Greta (Lauren Cohen) begins the film as an American who takes a job as a nanny for an aristocratic English couple. An oddball couple who don't actually have an 8 year old boy, but a life-sized porcelain doll.
Is the doll alive. Greta begins to think so.
Let's disect the film in detail:
1. The journey.
Well Greta comes from America and moves to an isolated home in rural England.
Not any old home. It is the classic haunted, dark, gothic mansion!
2. The ominous atmosphere.
The English couple seem uninviting and have a set of strict rules for Greta to follow when looking after the doll, Brahms.
3. The scary place. As already alluded to the house/mansion is dark, gothic and haunted looking.
Evil literally seeps from the walls!
4. Traditional horror scenes include a search in the attic ala The Exorcist.
5. Jumpscares. Several. Hands coming out of paintings etc.
6. Brahms as a doll is the 'monster' meant to amplify the surprise and terror.
Like a childhood toy?
7. An older Brahms has make up and looks akin to Michael Myers in Halloween.
8. The Final Girl. Well Greta is there right to the end.
9. A savant like character, Malcolm played by Rupert Evans knows some history of the English family and the doll set up.
10. Without revealing to much a classic sequel hook at the end. Added in case the film was a success to allow a sequel. I don't think a Boy 2 exists!
Relies on copying classic horror films to much with a distinctly B movie feel.",The Boy
80,Seth_Rogue_One,Not too shabby,8,29 April 2016,"I watch a lot of horrors, I've rated about 800 so far (and probably seen about 300 more at the very least).And although this is not one of the better horrors I've seen I'd say it's still definitely above average.It's a mystery so I can't really talk too much about the movie without hinting at spoilers and such so I'll keep that to a minimum.It's basically a creepy doll movie but not overly silly made like for instance 'DEAD SILENCE (2007)' or a slasher-doll movie like the Chucky- movies it takes it's time to develop and keeps the mystery going for quite some time, which makes it feel a bit like a psychological thriller and keeps us wondering what's going on and what's next.Lauren Cohan who plays Maggie in the TV-series 'The Walking Dead' handles the lead well, and the cinematography is stunning.So yeah if you're looking for a new horror movie to watch this is a valid choice.",The Boy
81,vampire_hounddog,An at times genuinely creepy film that turns into a more standard slasher in the second half,5,19 October 2020,"Escaping from an abusive relationship in the US, Greta (Lauren Cohan) takes on the job of nanny at an English country mansion. The parents (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) are about to go on vacation and leave the nanny in charge of their son who turns out to be a porcelain ventroliquist like dummy. Once she has overcome the shock and was not a joke, when she ignores the strict rules she notices things go bump in the night and her clothes begin to disappear.A good ol' classic gothic oddity horror that sometimes has a genuine sense of frisson which outshines some ropey acting and dialogue. The second half of the film totally shifts gear into an almost different film, becoming a little more like a stalk and slash horror. It was followed by another sequel, BRAHMS: THE BOY II in 2020 and again changed direction. Filmed in Canada.",The Boy
82,Hayden-86055,"Moderately creative thriller, if a bit dull",5,29 December 2020,"The Boy is a pretty decent film, it's obviously had a lot of creative thinking behind it and it's a huge shame it never really rises above curious mediocrity. The actual acting is fairly reasonable, especially from Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans. Plot wise is where it gains the most points for being original and interesting, but also loses some due to the slow development of the plot and overall lack of exciting moments, which is a shame as tension is built up well.The cinematography is good in places and the house is suitably dark, the actual doll is extremely creepy and very well made. It's just a shame we don't altogether see the doll in full action and in my opinion the ending wasn't as well done as I'd hoped for. It all gets a bit weird.5/10: Very creative but overall a bit boring",The Boy

It was very atmospheric and slow burning. I had no trouble being engaged and wanting to know what happened next. There were only one or two jump scares as well, with the film mostly relying on sheer creepiness and weirdness.Lauren Cohan propelled the film along single-handedly. Was my first time seeing her and I'll be sure to keep an eye out for more of her stuff in future. It's just a shame the was no pay-off for the audience who persisted with the slow-burn. The final act was ridiculous, unimaginative and squandered what potential it had built early on.Ultimately turned out to be quite a forgettable horror film.

Anybody remember Who Shot JR?This ""movie"" is one of the dumbest I've seen. I'm not going to list all the convoluted contrived setup of how Mag got to babysit this doll that its aging parents treat as a real boy, or all the garbage that follows. Please click 1 star reviews and you can read all the reviews detailing the stupidity that it is.All of a sudden Mike Myers makes an appearance, gets stabbed and keeps going. Wow, that's new, not. Mag is a good looking woman and she's a decent actress. But not a great actress. Check out Elizabeth Olsen in Silent House for portrayal of terror. If you're honest you will agree Olsen blows away Mag. In fact, I'll go further and say Mag should give up acting after seeing Olsen's performance.This movie is boring. Mag portrays her character as not very smart, or likeable. She throws the doll. Not thinking that maybe she'll break this precious doll she's entrusted to care for. She drinks wine all day, bored and passing out. 30 something loser babysitting a doll. Then we get Mr. Bad Guy X-Boyfriend. This is movie is a boring joke. What a shame. Another example of pollution.

92,dfa120374,Good But Could Have Been Better,6,14 August 2017,"Joining the likes of Chuckie and Annabelle is Brahms, a life-sized porcelain doll who figures prominently in this creepy horror film.Greta, a young woman who's taken a job as a nanny to an eight-year-old boy in a mansion in a remote part of English countryside has taken the assignment to escape romantic troubles. She's more than a little surprised, though, to discover that her new charge is actually a doll. He's the stand-in for the son of the dotty elderly couple the Heelshires, whose real son was killed in a fire 25 years earlier.Departing for their first holiday in decades, they leave Greta with a list of instructions for Brahms' care, including never covering his face and kissing him before he goes to bed. Initially put off by the situation's craziness, Greta soon settles into the mansion and in between handling unappealing assignments such as emptying rat traps, she periodically enjoys the company of Malcolm, the charming grocery deliveryman who shamelessly flirts with her.You can probably guess what happens next.Brahms seems to have a life of his own, mysteriously throwing off the blanket covering him, shifting positions and even moving from room to room. Greta at first puts this down to her imagination, but the more it happens, the more she suspects something is wrong. She even manages to persuade Malcolm that the doll is possessed by the spirit of the dead boy. At first things go smoothly, with Greta cooing over Brahms, but the unexpected arrival of her former boyfriend Cole, results in all hell breaking loose.The film generally succeeds in creating an eerie atmosphere, filling the screen with extended close-ups of sinister-looking toys, mounted animal heads and various architectural details of the house's nooks and crannies. However, with it only being a PG-13 there's a limitation on how creepy the movie can be which is a let down, BUT it's still a very watchable horror yarn.",The Boy
93,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,24 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""The Boy"" is a refreshing twist on the creepy doll story with a clever plot and surprising ending. I've always enjoyed a good evil doll movie and expected this one to fit the mold - but what I got was a fun change of turn. A much needed movie experience in a large array of cookie cutter films.The film starts out with a young Montana girl heading to the UK as the new nanny for the Heelshires, an older couple with a special child. A boy named Brahms. She readily accepts the job trying to escape the clutches of her abusive boyfriend and a sordid past. When she arrives, she finds that Brahms is nothing more than a porcelain doll. At first, she thinks it's a joke. But seeing the seriousness of the situation, she slowly begins to realize that there is a reason behind it all. And it's not what you think. Soon, she finds herself running from anything more dangerous that even her boyfriend could be.Having seen tons of thriller/horror movies that involved a doll that appears to be able to move around on its own, watch people, and do things that they shouldn't be able to do, I settled in expecting to receive pretty much the same kind of formula. Not to be so. This movie was a nice surprise. The pacing was excellent, not lagging too long in any area, keeping the story and suspense moving straight forward until it's climactic finish. The acting was pretty good, the cinematography good as well.I highly recommend ""The Boy"". It's a sleeper hit and one to be seen more than once.

95,nitzanhavoc,Not what you might think it to be - for better or for worse.,7,16 June 2016,"It is somewhat difficult for me to explain my viewing experience of this film, and in no way do I mean to sound condescending of uppity, so kindly bear with me... Usually, after years of ""experience"" with a certain hobby, one is able to differentiate objective criticism from lack of personal satisfaction. For me, The Boy is a perfect example, so I'll make sure to separate my personal opinions from what I perceive to be the makings of a fine Horror film.I've always been a big fan of the Supernatural sub-genre, with a special liking to films portraying evil dolls (films like Dead Silence or Annabelle, NOT Chucky). After watching the trailer for The Boy several months ago, I've been eagerly anticipating its release. As presented in the teasers, the story is original and well told (hats off to screenwriter Stacey Menear), and the jump-scares (while still cheap) are sufficiently few and well made to add the occasional scare without damaging the experience. Music and cinematography are great, as is the acting (especially supporting actors Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle as Mr. and Mrs. Hillshire).Now for my problem... the plot twist is smart, surprising and in no way predictable (although some of you might have guessed it from the start, I personally was impressed). It adds a stroke of genius creativity and originality to an otherwise all too known pattern of a film. I just didn't like it... it felt too original, like trying to reinvent the wheel when the wheel works just fine. Objectively - great twist, great ending! In my opinion? A let down.All in all, the eerie sense of suspense and fear is maintained throughout the entire film, and I would definitely recommend it to other ""supernatural dolls"" fans. However, personally, I couldn't help but feeling it was ultimately a let-down, and I wouldn't watch it again.",The Boy

I had seen something similar before--the god-awful ""Robert the Doll,""- - and I did not know whether or not this would be in the same vein as that train wreck was. I was pleasantly surprised.Greta, an American nanny, goes to London to escape her abusive boyfriend/stalker. She thinks she has taken a job to watch over a very young boy. She is immediately befriended by the local grocery delivery person, Malcolm.As soon as she arrives, weird things start to happen and one of those ""things"" includes who she will be taking care of. When she meets Brahms, she is shocked to say the least because he is a life size doll. She is given a strict set of rules and a schedule that must be met every day. These rules include waking Brahms precisely at 7:00 a.m., changing his clothes, listening to at least three hours of music, reading him poetry, and tucking him into bed. Once Brahms' parents leave for holiday, things really begin to ratchet up in the old estate.""The Boy"" will not win any awards for being great cinema. However, it is leaps and bounds better than some other movies I've recently seen.

105,dommercaldi,"Fairly Standard, Fairly Forgettable",5,16 May 2021,"Pros:
1. The lingering steady shots on the Brahms doll help to increase the horror by giving the impression that he is always watching and listening.2. Cole (Ben Robson) is on the end of an incredibly violent and satisfying death.3. There are really good performances by Lauren Cohan (Greta Evans), and particularly James Russell (Brahms Heelshire) who delivers a terrific physical performance that is simultaneously manic, predatory and powerful, but also meek and immature when it needs to be.4. The transition from supernatural to an inversed home-invasion/ serial killer horror is extremely smooth.Cons:
1. The audio at times sounds as if it was recorded in a studio post-production.2. Some of the camera-shots are quite clearly added to force horror into moments that don't need it and they fail miserably.3. The score is massively overplayed thus it does a better job at killing the tension than enhancing it.4. Most of the jump-scares not only fail to scare, they also deflate the tension and suspense obnoxiously.5. Somehow Brahms Heelshire manages to survive a would-be fatal stabbing to the heart to set up a pointless sequel.6. It's never explained how Brahms Heelshire can move around the house as quickly and quietly as he does. The movie additionally never explains why Brahms Heelshire hid himself away for 20 years, or why Mr. And Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) never sought out help when Brahms Heelshire was still a kid.",The Boy

When I first watched the film I loved the overall eerie tone of the film, a gorgeous gothic filming location and Lauren Cohan is a likeable actress playing the lead role. I personally loved the ending of the film, I feel like it just stepped up the films intensity for the final moments. The sequel however I can't say the same for.",The Boy
108,TheRedDeath30,A Mediocre Movie Made Worse by Ridiculous Twist,5,24 July 2016,"SPOILERS WILL ABOUND HERE. TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM PLEASEThis movie combines all of the worst aspects of what is wrong with horror and Hollywood writing, in general, in 2016. It's a mediocre, unoriginal and bland thriller that relies on generic jump scares to create most of its' tension. After, at the least, maintaining a clear narrative the movie unleashes on of the most ridiculous twist endings since HIGH TENSION.Lauren Cohen stars in this movie from Universal (that signifies how far they have fallen from their glory years of horror). She is an American girl who has moved to England to escape some dark moments in her life and take a job as a nanny. Only this is no ordinary nanny job, she is to watch a doll. As if that wasn't bizarre enough, the ""parents"" of this doll have a laundry list of very particular rules for the nanny to follow. Almost immediately, they leave her alone with the doll. Of course, like most of us would do, she doesn't take these duties seriously at first, ignoring the doll and going on about her life isolated in this country home. Then, things start to go weird, as items disappear and finally she is trapped overnight in an attic.After these events, our heroine starts to take the doll seriously and realize that there is a spirit in the house who demands care of the doll or will unleash devilish tricks on her. Most of us have an innate unsettled feeling with dolls and mannequins and the movie does a good job of playing with this fear. There are some genuinely creepy scenes where the doll will unnerve even the most jaded horror fan. Unfortunately, the movie falls down generic Hollywood horror traps far too often, though, as almost every real ""scare"" in this movie is the most boring of boring types -- the jump scare. Yes, the music ratchets up, the mood intensifies and the camera zooms in slowly only for something to jump out at us with a loud noise, accompanied by jarring music. It's such lazy film making.Lauren Cohen doesn't help much here, either. She's a pretty face that most know from THE WALKING DEAD, but even as an ardent fan of that show, I found her to be a generic actress there. Try as the show might to make Maggie interesting, Cohen just brings no real emotion to the role. Here, it's much the same. She's the pretty girl next door and that's about it. It's hard to feel much for her because the actress has done nothing to bring sympathy to the role.Still, all things considered, for the first 75 minutes or so the movie has done an average job of presenting an, at least, entertaining (if unmemorable) thriller, then we get to the twist. Hollywood seems to have a fascination with the twist and I think that horror falls into this trap the worst. This is the most horrid kind of twist. Look at a classic twist like THE SIXTH SENSE. The viewer can go back and re- watch the film and there is ample evidence everywhere that the viewer could have seen this coming. The twist does something to support the previous narrative and make it all the more impactful. Too many amateur writers seem to feel it is okay to just pull the rug out from under the viewer and say ""Aha, I got you"". No, you didn't ""get"" anyone with this ending. You spent all of this time building a tense mood around a spirit who may be possessing this doll, then soiled all over it. There are so many things the writer could have done intelligently with that premise, but the real threat is much more generic. What was the point of having a doll in the first place? Why all the rules? Why the doll? Why bother? You could have done a ghost story and left out the twist. You could have done a creepy mystery guy movie and left out the doll. By combining these, you've only created something ludicrous. It's tempting for a writer because an unintelligent viewer will typically confuse an out of nowhere twist with good writing, but this just isn't the case. A twist means nothing if you didn't support it along the way, build towards it and use it to bring meaning to what has come before. Otherwise, all you've done is left one narrative unfinished and tacked on a different story at the end.",The Boy
109,SyoKennex,"Thrilling, Chilling and all round brilliant",8,21 September 2017,"The Boy is a thriller-horror movie that was released in 2015; a young American nanny travels to England to escape her past and babysit a young couple's son whilst they go on holiday - only for the son to be a doll. Predictably, the doll begins to do creepy things when she doesn't adhere to the strict rules that she is meant to. The editing in this film is extremely well done and seriously helps to build up an atmosphere, and countless times I had goosebumps crawling up my arms. Continuing on from the usual paranormal activity, that isn't really original in the doll horror genre, everything gets turned on it's head when the plot is twisted, and the film becomes even more terrifying, just for the more realist aspect of it. Lauren Cohan did absolutely amazing acting in this movie; there is no doubting she was one of the best choices for this role, and the film just wouldn't be the same without her carrying it. Although I have no idea how she kept her cool, having to act most of the scenes with a doll - I would have been in hysterics most of filming.The Boy was absolutely chilling, and I would recommend this to any horror lover.",The Boy

Guess I was expecting the actual doll to be alive and creepy, but it was pretty cool to discover that the movie didn't rely on that kind of cliche stupidities, but gave us a living, breathing villain instead. I think Brams started to love her and just didn't want to be left alone again, but he was really creepy at the same time, which is why he never quite got his wish. It's a little sad, I feel a tidbit bad for him because he doesn't seem utterly evil at all. Just a man with some crazy dangerous, deep issues.",The Boy
111,FallenEye,"The Boy, Toy.",7,30 October 2021,"The Boy I feel did a rather decent job at trying to provide a fresh approach to the whole ""haunted house"" old chestnut. I do however, also feel that a specific twist in the story, though it provides a pretty well constructed surprise, may not go down so well with avid horror fans, because it is a twist that to very large extent, jeopardizes the horror element at perhaps its most critical point, which also admittedly sacrifices potentially great scares, but, that is the cost the movie paid for choosing a more fresh take over a more cliché retake, and I believe it did it pretty well.Lauren Cohan performed her role satisfactorily, and the story cloaked itself with some competently crafted creativity. The cinematography was first-rate and the directing was overall, good.It may have had some points here and there where it flatlined just a little bit, as well as another point where it may have given away a rather important piece of the story maybe a bit too early, but The Boy once all is said and done, was a well made horror flick, that fared pretty well at trading cheap scares for a fresh lens, though that also risked the possibility of even greater scares to go with some great scares it already had.7/10.",The Boy
112,MikesIDhasbeentaken,"Flawed, but great idea",6,2 September 2016,"Anyone watching the trailer and liking the look of this should watch it. Yes it goes a bit off course towards the end, but it had to go somewhere. And unless it was going to be another childs play it had to be different. I think most would agree the first hour is better than the second, the tension, suspense and mystery is what your watching this for so it'll always lead to disappointment when the reveal isn't as clever as you wished, and more annoyingly leads to another hour of the move which is different to the one you wanted to watch.It's still worth a watch",The Boy
113,FelipeCarrillo,""" Never Leave Him Alone """,5,7 February 2016,"""The Boy"" lies before a striking premise. ""The Boy"" is composed of a doll for nothing frightening, a house scary old and an unbalanced performance by Lauren Cohan (Maggie, ""The Walking Dead""). Director William Brent Bell offers few moments of horror to satisfy fans of the genre, but the majority of the tension of the film is based on jump-scares and frights common in the world of horror, making us question Could not have been better with a development more coherent? Lauren Cohan is ""Greta"" a young American teenager who escapes from a tortuous relationship and takes a baby-sitting job in a village far away from society and looking gloomy, as soon as she accepts the job, should already know that Brahms should receive a kiss goodnight and must take care not to break or a single rule. After the explanations and others. Greta attempts to understand parents, and with the exception of Malcolm (Rupert Evans), she starts a single transition with the strange doll, where at the end unusually understands and follows the game in a natural and comprehensive way. This installment, is apparently a prospect of lean mixture between the so scary ""Annabelle"" (in matters of the doll) and the 2006 film ""When a Stranger Calls"" (in matters of work babysitting), we often see references of not only these two tapes, also from his previous project ""The Devil Inside"". From there, the film takes a couple of unnecessary turns and for fans of the horror the end despite breaking schemes of the genre, it is stupid and irrational, wasting the few merits as until then had managed to raise. But considering its classification PG -13 and what it could offer us, we all knew that this was not going to make the best horror film of the year but could reach the label "" The Best and Original Horror Film of 2016 , to the date"". Cohan performance is uneven, the first hour is tortuous and tense and fails her fully know what happens , unfortunately like all horror movies today , the real excitement starts in the last half hour where the film takes a turn I look that even innovative and irreproachable, also feels like a disappointment.",The Boy

I often find the quality poor, and the story line thin and weak in recent horror films that are made. Therefore, this film a welcome positive surprise. I'll make this review short and of course not reveal any of the action. If you like to sit down with popcorn on the sofa and watch horror movie, then you can safely rent this movie. It is well made. And the casting is very good.The film is pretty scary, and will give you some shocks under viewing.

Excellent movie choice a late night, in other words.",The Boy
115,PetarNeo,Horror or something else?,5,10 November 2016,"From the start it seemed like a very good and potentially great plot for the movie that represents itself as a horror movie but then as the ending is coming movie just turned to a different path and failed in every way. As you get to know everything and everybody movie starts with couple of good scares and some mystery and it's obvious that Greta played by Lauren is scared but then realizes that boy really is ""alive"". It starts to get more and more tense as she tries to do something with Malcom but then it just fells apart as Cole her husband arrives at the house. It becomes a boring movie with guy that obviously isn't fit to be anybody husband bullies Greta and eventually creeps out with income of destroying the doll. Then it all fell apart as you realize real Brahms is alive and well groomed man that is now chasing everybody wishing to kill them because of some reason. Movie just switched pace from slow to super speed and it was horrible as guy kills Cole, beats to death Malcom and when Greta returns acts like he listens to her. It had potential to be a great and interesting horror movie with very good acting and pace but then it just shifted to simple chase scenes. Only thing in whole movie that it managed to do is trick you with knowledge that Brahms is dead. Not quite sure what the movie was about at the end, was it a horror that wasn't horror or was it a tale of a Brahms that isn't tale of a Brahms. 1.5/4",The Boy

117,kingofdanerds,Had low expectations for this film,4,30 October 2020,"During the COVID 19 pandemic, many people are using streaming services such as Netflix to watch movies since the theaters are all closed. I took to Netflix and decided to watch 2016's The Boy. I somewhat remember seeing the trailer for this film and had low expectations for this film. I just saw it as another haunted doll movie much like the Annabelle movies (of which I have only seen the first film). The film itself was directed by William Brent Bell who apparently from what I have heard, directed films that were pieces of crap and people who really hated those early films have said The Boy is one of the better ones. The film stars Lauren Cohan who is most well known for her role in The Walking Dead. The film itself did alright at the box office and critics and audiences were not entirely impressed with the film. But there are people out there that actually praise this film (not too highly though).We meet Greta who has been hired as a nanny by an elderly couple. A nanny to who you may ask? A doll named Brahms. Apparently the doll is a way for the elderly couple to grief over the death of their son who died 20 years before. When the elderly couple leaves, Greta is left alone. Or is she????????Well, I had low expectations going into this film and.........that is about it. This film when it gets to a certain point, could really go anywhere in terms of story. I went into this film thinking that I was going to be watching one type of film and it ended up being a different type of film altogether and I can't really explain much more without giving out any spoilers. But lets hust say that I was not a huge fan of what the film ended up being. Sure, I came into this film thinking it was going to be one type of film with that type of film being unoriginal. The film ended up being a type of film that with the previous elements already in the film, just made me scratch my head. There is a bit in the middle of the film where it makes it feel like another type of film which is the type that I was a bigger fan of and would have liked to see that part be used for the rest of the film. I was more invested in the middle of the film than in the beginning or end. (Hopefully all of that makes sense. Just try to keep in mind that I am trying to write a spoiler free review and this film is fairly hard to write a spoiler free review of). Plus, I do not understand how a sequel could be successfully made (and a sequel was made but sucked). The film is one of those PG-13 horror films that are not in the least bit scary. There are two instances where I actually was scared but was largely dissappointed by them being one of those dream sequence fakeout scenes. The acting overall is largely mediocre with Lauren Cohan giving a decent performance. Another thing is that I found myself having a hard time listening to the dialouge in this film. I turned my TV up to a serviceable volume for what I usually watch and I still had a hard time listening and I am very convinced that it is the movies problem because everything else in the film is of normal volume. So, I most likely missed out on some key details in conversations that occured so it is no wonder I had scratched my head for a few instances (but not for the ending though). The one thing that I think this film does fairly well is developing an atmosphere. If you take a look of the house that this film takes place in, it looks like a place that would be haunted. It is a dark, stone building. No flowers to decorate it or anything. The inside is old and a little creepy as well. Even the doll can be said to be fairly creepy at times as well.I honestly had low expectations for this film and that is pretty much what I got for the most part. The Boy could have went anywhere in terms of story and ended up having the film switch from one type of story over to another (and more) silly type of film. It does have nice atmosphere and I will give it that. It might not have been my type of film, but I suppose someone out there would enjoy this film.",The Boy
118,scb_coldsteel,Swing and a miss....,5,1 October 2018,"I always appreciate exploring movies I have not seen before. So I finished the movie The Boy on Netflix. I remember the movie from a few years ago, but never got around to watching it. The premise of the movie starts out fairly typical horror. A young women with a troubled past seeks to get away from it all by taking a job as a nanny in a remote mansion. As it turns out she is hired on to watch over a ceramic doll and from there the creepy stuff starts coming.I wasn't looking forward to this movie as I'm kind of tired of the Demonic doll cliche. It's been done so many times there is nothing new that can be brought to the table. Unfortunately this movie relies heavily on horror film cliches and tropes that are just tired.Character motivation is important to craft a believable film but it seemed the main character's actions in this movie were all over the place. Near midway through the film her actions didn't really feel real and were there just to keep the plot rolling.This movie does put a twist on the demonic doll aspect near the end of the movie that for me tried too hard to wow. It was supposed to be a grand twist no one saw coming, but felt more like Shyamalan in the Village.As far as actually horror elements the movie really provided fairly typical horror cliche moments. It was creepy constantly seeing the doll, but the movie never really captured a atmosphere that worked to intensify fear.It was not a bad movie, but it just didn't do anything to wow either. I liked that they tried to try something new, but the execution left something to be desired for. Horror has had it rough for a decade because of subpar films recycling cliches so I'm a bit rough on the genre. Overall the movie was a 5 out of 10.",The Boy
119,datorsiers2,"Interesting premise, lack luster execution",6,28 October 2017,"First of all, i would like to point out the writer didn't even know where the story was going when he started writing the script for this film, hence we have all these plot holes and movie ruining story lines appearing here.Apart from having plot holes and the story going rapidly downhill at the end the first 1 hour of the already short runtime created a strange, but somewhat suspenseful atmosphere and it for a brief moment it looked like it was going to unfold in an awesome movie with a great plot twist or just an action packed thrilling ending, instead we got presented with the dumbest plot hole i thought of and the movie ends without much real action. Throughout the film you will make see 3 jump scares at best, so do not watch this movie for the horror of it, there is none. At least the premises the movie was shot at looked gorgeous, that played a great impact into setting the mood in the first half of the movie, which of course only lead the an unpleasant ending.Maybe some people will see this film and think it is awesome, i can not judge everyones taste, but it simply is a mediocre horror film, that will be forgotten and there is nothing special about it.",The Boy

So of course I haven't seen many horror films in my time but I really enjoyed this one.The plot at the start is very simple, an American nanny goes to England to babysit. When she gets there she realises that she is in fact going to be taking care of a doll instead of a human. The parents go off and leave a set of rules for her to follow but she of course thinks this is silly, after all it's just a doll...or so it would seem.Although the film does rely on a few jump scares, I found the atmosphere the film creates was terrific, and basic things happening seemed to ramp up the tension. At first I was suspicious of a few of the secondary characters involved in the film but as we got towards the end of the film, the reveal of who/what The Boy really is was a shocking twist which in my opinion worked very well.The Walking Dead's Lauren Cohan gives a good performance in the lead role (the first film I've ever seen her in) and The Boy is just creepy and put me on edge.Overall I found it to be a good film with a good horror atmosphere which doesn't rely on the usual slash and gore. I would class it as more of a thriller. Better than expected and would recommend.",The Boy

It eschews jump scares (outside of two terrible dream sequences) and follows its own humdrum rhythm. I want to commend it for that but it never delivers much more and the story never makes much sense.The ending avoids the typical expectations here, and while there are mentions of a ripoff of Housebound in some reviews, this isn't really valid here. If this had gone the supernatural route it would have been just like a zillion other films. Damned if you do, damned if you don't; everything has been done.

Little does she know the wealthy owners of the grand house she'll be staying in have a doll as a son, with many rules that must be followed to keep the boy happy. Seems easy enough, until she deviates from the set guidelines, and spooky things start to happen...The Boy typically goes through the motions as you await answers and, unfortunately, the sequences the trailer gets you hyped for can't make up for the mess that comes later. Manipulative scare tactics through camera work and audio are abound in this wannabe horror; more than likely to elicit groans than chills except for the most undemanding of horror film-goers. There are many poor attempts to get you hooked, which is down to lazy writing with a premise seemingly ripe for atmospheric chills.Then it botches its finale. A simple, supernatural ending would have sufficed, but instead the scripts pretentious beats overwhelmingly take over in the final act with an unconvincing twist/explanation that erases everything that held promise in the occasionally creepy outset. The horror movie trope of what's left unseen is more scary is ironically undermined here, where the opposite may have been a more worthy way to instil some dread.

Of course, it's an interesting story, but at the same time it isn't the best of horror films and it isn't the worst either. In this day and age it's probably difficult to come up with something different and odd in the genre of horror. This is where ""The Boy"" succeeded. ""The Boy"" was almost like two different types of horror films rolled into one. You have the haunted doll story plus a little bit of the American slasher story combined in the same story. With the haunted doll side of this film it is a bit creepy, and that's really what makes the film what it is, now the slasher side of it could have been a bit more graphic but it probably wasn't what the writers wanted the film to be remembered for.

The idea itself is just completely stupid, and the theater were thinking ""WTF"" when I saw it. But it actually is wonderfully filmed and wonderfully told that eventually by the end it all makes sense. The acting was okay. Lauren Cohan was the best thing about it. She made this bizarre story really realistic. The direction was good, the style of the whole movie was well portrayed. The cinematography was surprisingly good.The movie is a huge combination of others films such as ""Child's Play"" and ""When A Stranger Calls."" Strangely enough it is a weird combination, but it does work. The whole story starts out to give us the supernatural vibe...the doll moving...hearing voices and movement etc. It's all good, but the problem is...with this movie it gets old and boring rather quickly. That's where the main problem lies, it's the pace of the film. It all makes up for it by the end when the twist is revealed and it turns into a slasher flick. But, in the end, I just felt like it was rushed. It ended too fast. It's like they couldn't be bothered giving us more action for another 10 mins or so. Which is quite a disappointment.All in all...The Autistic Reviewers give this movie 3/5 stars. 6/10. It is acceptable and unique, but we felt it was a hugely missed opportunity.

129,danielharden,Pervy Porcelin Doll,4,31 March 2016,"The Boy is about a creepy ass doll that is treated like a person, and who Walking Dead star, Lauren Cohen is tasked with nannying in a equally creepy ass house.First off, the film isn't scary, and this is coming from someone who is very easily scared (if you exclude the doll giving Greta a peanut butter sandwich scene God Damn!). This film most certainly won't follow you out the movie theatre. You can see that the filmmakers really tried to build suspense and tension albeit through conventional means like; a spooky house, corridor wondering at night, dream sequences, china dolls and a few jump scares littered throughout. But, although an attempt was made, the result has little impact bar a few expected reflexes.The Boy is unfortunately one of those horror movies that contains; poorly shot scenes (yes I'm talking about the parents suicide), plot holes, hundreds of unanswered questions originated due to poor logic and also, unintentionally hilarious moments.I must say that Brahms is one pervy china doll. Literally for the majority of the film all this doll does is steal Lauren Cohen's clothes and just stare at her in general including during sexy time. To be honest it is clear that the reason she was chosen as the nanny was because of Brahms sexual attraction towards her, but to me, a perverted doll with the hots for his nanny is simply laughable.I have to bring up the parents suicide scene because I could not stop questioning and laughing at it due to its visuals and logic. Firstly the couple pick up a rather large pebble, about the size of their hand. Why? Was the pebble ""so heavy"" that it drowned them? Maybe if they took a dozen plus (of the same size or bigger) then put them in their pockets, THEN I may believe it... But no. One pebble equals drowning. And if that wasn't hilarious enough then the fact there isn't a shot of the two with their heads underwater is also baffling. Allow me to elaborate. The couple look like they went for a good ol' swim and then suddenly, jump cut, they disappeared, although I understood what the filmmakers where going for it could have been made much clearer and did not have to look so darn goofy.The ending. The ending to The Boy is aimed to be ambiguous, but probably not to the degree I found it so. So the big reveal of the film is that Brahms never died and was hiding in the walls of the house, moving the doll for 20 years... Why has he been in the walls for 20 years? I can understand initially to hide from the police due to killing that girl but 20 YEARS!? He could've surely come out years ago couldn't he? Also the final shot of the film is probably the most confusing shot in the entire film. The doll is put back together again by someone hidden from the camera (most likely undead human Brahms)... But why? Who is going to come to this house anymore? The parents are dead, the nanny and grocery man are long gone so who? And don't even get me started on the ""HE'S STILL ALIVE"" implication here.Overall the Boy is a not so scary horror movie that, to be honest, has one or two moments I must confess, but for the most part is heavily flawed with; plot holes, formulaic scares, unintentional Hilarity, lack of explanation in its logic etc. It's meh, but if you like horror films then maybe check it out, or not, up to you but it just isn't for me.",The Boy

The only thing I knew about this movie is that it's a horror movie and involves a creepy doll.My expectations weren't high at all so I wasn't disappointed, but I didn't love it either. It was entertaining, but there was only one scary scene in a movie and the rest wasn't scary at all. But the third act was pretty intense. Intense, but not scary. The movie ends up being more of a thriller, than a horror. And not even the jumpscares made me jump. I just sat there motionless. For the first half, the plot isn't going anywhere and most of the ""scary"" scenes were just the main character's nightmares. Then the plot finally starts to move in the second half and it gets really intense when the movie comes to it's third act. There is a plot twist at the end, but I was expecting it from the very beginning. I didn't expect what will happen, but I knew there was going to be a plot twist at the end. It just felt like it. And it's pretty cool when you're watching it, but when you think about it you realize that it's kinda dumb and a lot of stuff is left unexplained. But the villain of this movie, Brahms, is awesome. Especially in the last 15 minutes, those who saw the movie will know why. And I think if this gets a sequel (I hope it doesn't turn out to be a joke like the most horror sequels), Brahms could become a new horror icon. Kinda like Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger... Too bad the writers didn't think a little about the plot twist.But if you are going to watch this movie for entertainment, you'll be pleased. It's nothing special, but you won't feel like you wasted 90 minutes of your life for nothing.",The Boy
132,MUFCOK,"Just as you would expect, it had next to no real scares and plenty of Hollywood clichés.",6,12 May 2016,"It could be that the quality is getting worse or it could be down to the fact that I have seen so many over the years, but Mainstream, Hollywood horror movies just don't seem to give me any real scares anymore. This however doesn't stop me actively looking out for and watching them as they are released, there is something I find satisfying about watching horror movies at night, irrelevant of their quality. I saw the promos for The Boy late last year; it was a January release which by recent history would put it in the category of rubbish. However that didn't stop me watching this and I was secretly quite looking forward to it!The plot is different, yet basic: A wealthy, elderly English couple hire a young, attractive American live-in Nanny to look after their son. Their son however isn't a boy, he is a doll. The couple talk about, talk to and generally treat the doll as if he were a living boy. Of course the Nanny finds this peculiar but cautiously goes along with it as they are paying her well. As you would expect, things start to happen once the couple leave to go on a trip and leave the Nanny home alone in this huge house with the only the doll for company. Now, if there is one thing Hollywood Horror movies have taught us over the years, it's that we are to expect clichéd jump scares. These aren't scary but they do make you jump, it's only natural for them to do so. The Boy did contain jump scares but I really didn't think they were that well done, I don't remember a scene where I actually jumped or was taken by any real surprise. If there is anything worse than jump scares, its attempted jump scares which fail! The film does however focus heavily on building suspense, each scene adds to this. A big positive I would give this movie is that it didn't reveal anything early on that would have ruined the suspense. Of course we know that the doll won't be as it seems, it's a horror film, nothing is ever as it seems but they did work at it to ensure that we are kept guessing well into the final third of the movie.The plot twist was unexpected, as the film built I had another theory of what was going to happen and I was way off the mark. I'm not saying that the twist is ground-breaking, I'm sure plenty of people did see it coming but I was expecting something else completely. After the final scenes I was able to think back to early scenes and realise why certain things were said and done, this added a little bit more depth to the story and a few things did link up nicely.The acting and script was what you would expect from a movie of this genre, it was all passable enough with nothing that stands out as impressive. The sets, props and filming locations were all well done and added to the atmosphere and realism successfully.Overall, The Boy was average but ultimately offered very few scares for me and I found the twist to be a little underwhelming, even if it was unexpected. I watched this on a rainy night after a few beers and it was a decent enough way of passing 90 minutes or so.6/10",The Boy
133,djangozelf-12351,Oh boy...this is not a horror and not a good thriller.,3,11 May 2016,"I had some hope for this one bit it's just another use of the horror genre to fool the audience.The whole set up with the doll was boring and all the rules seem to be filler to make this part longer. The elderly couple takes a third of the movie to explain the whole story and then leave and in that time there gets a bit of mystery added to the story.Another third the girl is alone in the house and the mystery of the ""moving by itself when it's not seen""doll becomes more clear.The big reveal is stupid about someone living between the walls(people under the stairs)and moves the doll around. When you see this guy you're wandering how he stayed so quiet all the time.So that's the last third of the movie and is also the point I thought about stopping with watching this movie. I finished it anyway maybe it would have an intense chase scene but they even couldn't give me that.Conclusion,I don't like movies like this,I like the actress in ""the walking dead""but this a bad choice as a start on the big screen.I still think she can do better but than in a different genre or even a better horror story.Also,was I the only person not getting, why he was moving the doll around?I recommend this for some people,the production value isn't bad and maybe you like PG horror/thriller than it will work well for you. If you're a horror fan like me you probably will not like it.A misleading movie.Horror-ish?LOL(with a Chuckie chuckle)",The Boy

I made myself get up to go see this film. Funny, there was no advertisement or nothing in the papers, reviews and all about his film, but it just sounded weird as I reviewed the site of the cinema I went to. Without knowing what to fully expect, I went with a female friend who very hesitantly was dragged to go see this film. We saw this around midnight. Now keep in mind, she did not want to be there and I was tired as hell. I kid you not. This film is very atmospheric and is scared the living sh** out of me. Of course any film with a doll starring in it, specially a scary doll will have that effect on me, and if its well done well... lets just say I lost my bucket of popcorn watching this film. Is was scary all the way to the end. I must, however, say i would not have chosen the ending it did, but I get it. Anyhow, don't want to spoil it, there isn't much else to say. You have to see for yourself to experience the fright. Not sure about you, but I hate when people tell me about horror films. All i need to know is that its good. So go out there and be scared cause this one is nightmare inducing.",The Boy

138,hoxjennifer,An intense thriller,8,30 December 2016,"This is a very well executed psychological thriller, with a little plot twist at the end that you might not suspect. The plot really did not disappoint. The acting was great, characters were well developed and genuinely likable. Although one goof was that the house is not typical of an English countryside manor, the atmosphere actually went very well with the movie. There is an excellent mood that is set, more reminiscent of American 18th century horror, but it nonetheless works.As I alluded to before, this film is less horror and more psychological thriller. It works much better in the latter category, so if you're expecting to a good horror, this might disappoint. But as a thriller, ""The Boy"" is excellent.",The Boy
139,tiskec,Debatable Twist,6,7 November 2016,"I thought this movie did an excellent job with the creepy scares. You get a sincere feeling like this doll that these old people have is one weird doll. It's hard to explain. Even I'd think it was haunted if I seen the thing. I wouldn't even let it in the house. Porcelain dolls like that just give me the eeby-jeebies. If I seen anyone taking care of it like a child, I would've stopped, turned right back around, and left. Simple. I would automatically think those people are nuts. If they think the doll has this boy's spirit, what do they think of me? I would've been outta that house in a jiffy. The actors did a really good job implementing the creepy jive that the owners of the house put off. What weirdos hey? Eeee! The all around acting wasn't bad at all. Even the facial expressions were legit. Now, the twist could be taken as either good or bad. To some, it maybe good, because it kind of fools you into thinking it's a supernatural movie and the doll is haunted. To others, they may think that the twist was great, because it wasn't they had expected from the film. To me, I wasn't a big fan of the twist. I had been seeking a supernatural film to watch at the time, and I came to find out that my expectations were let down. This is one of those movies that you either like, or you don't. Everything was pretty good as far as talent in the film. Nothing was really at the ""bad"" level, like the acting or anything else. It's going to be the story-line's twist that dictates what type of viewers will enjoy this film or not. I would actually recommend this as a ""creepy-scare"" movie, to those who enjoy them.",The Boy
140,wrightiswright,Oh Boy...,4,1 May 2016,"The Boy is a really, really stupid so-called horror flick which starts off with an intriguing premise, before mining every cliché possible out of the old left-alone-in-a-spooky-house scenario and finally sputtering out with a completely formula ending.With only five cast members, you'd think they'd at least give each one an original personality, but sadly no. You have the woman in peril running away from a tragic past, the grocery boy who happens to be a bit of a hunk, the possessive ex with a fierce looking beard and 'tache, and the old couple with something to hide. Boring, boring, boring.I don't care how low your budget is Mr Director, I'm sure you can do a lot better than this. Moving things between shots, and strange noises in the background does not a creepy flick make. I ended up not caring about any of these characters, not frightened in the slightest and checking my phone during the l-o-n-g drawn out scenes. But hey, nice carving job on Ken.",The Boy
141,tstudstrup,Pretty dumb and predictable,1,21 September 2016,"I had such high expectations for this as I'm a sucker for horror-movies with creepy dolls. But what a complete load of crap this is.First of all: when a woman comes to a house and discovers the boy she's suppose to be a nanny for is really just a doll and the dolls parents appear insane, the woman should just leave.Second of all: when said woman finds out the doll could be alive, she should get the hell out of the house and never come back.thirdly: when the same woman discovers the doll is alive, she should not stay in the house and nuture it like a real boy. And act as crazy as the boys parents. She should act like a normal person and get the hell outta there.fourth: instead of sacrificing women hired as nannies for their boy, why the hell didn't the parents get help in the local town when they found out their boy never died in the fire? fifth: why didn't the boy (really a grown man) reveal himself to the woman when he was finally completely alone with her? As hot as Lauren Cohan is it's hard to believe that they would hire a 34 year old woman as a nanny for their boy instead of a woman in her early twenties.The whole idea that she connects with the boy/mans parents because she lost her own baby in miscarriage is retarded.And why is her abusive ex: Cole, not in prison for beating her so she lost her baby? This movie might have been scarier had it been rated R. The little violence there is, is bloodless and completely unconvincing.",The Boy
142,Oberrated,Shockingly good for a Hollywood horror,7,21 April 2016,"So, as many of my closest acquaintances know, the horror genre is a very sensitive subject to me when it comes to what I like and what I do not like. As most horror films have come within years, I have not been a fan of very many especially one of my recent views, 'The Forest'. 'The Boy' however, get ready for it impressed and shocked me. I am a huge fan of 'The Boy'. I found the scare moments not that bad, I even fell for one jump scare but even beyond the scare moments, I felt creeped out at some of the moments presented by this film. Even after a certain point, I found myself unable to close my mouth because the film made my jaw drop in shock as some of the very eerie moments started to unravel and I lost myself in what was happening. By the end of the film I was overall shocked and appreciative of the story and how everything played out. So yes people, I am a fan of this horror flick. I would advise people to go out and check this one out, it is great for date night, it is great in regards to story and eerie horror elements, overall, it was a pretty damn great film.",The Boy

Yes there is minor investigations by Greta but it's just bare minimum investigations. It's set in a most apt ye old house and does feel very atmospheric at times.There are some cheap jump scares but i was totally sucked in to the story of this movie.

144,Mikelikesnotlikes,Creepy but under-developed,6,5 September 2017,"I will admit I was totally sucked into watching this film because I saw Lauren Cohen in the trailer. She was attractive in THE WALKING DEAD but we only ever got to see her dirty and without makeup. In THE BOY she is quite stunning and a very good actor which helps as well.The film THE BOY started off quite effectively. Remote location, weird employers, and a passably believable explanation for the doll. When the old couple leaves for a 'holiday' it's understandable that Greta would put the doll aside and do her own thing. But then the 'antics' start.I found Greta's reactions to the initial pranks be totally unrealistic. Surely your first thoughts would not be that the doll was alive! If I started finding my stuff disappearing and appearing in other places, I'd be searching for a human perpetrator.But Greta manages to become a true believer of the haunted doll in a few minutes flat. I may even have been forgiven this but she manages to make Malcolm, (the horny delivery man), a true believer in a few minutes as well. It felt like a rushed script and came across as surreal and unnatural.The old boyfriend turning up was a waste of screen time. The twist of Brahm's reality was bizarre and unsupported by a coherent back- story.Here's what I think happened. The writer/s made an unnecessary mess of the plot, the director tried to include all of the ideas only to have the producer cut and paste it together badly.Only worth watching to admire Lauren's talent.",The Boy

There's a great mystery with the doll sometimes but it sounds obvious where they are going since there's no ghost or doll that moves... To me The Boy is a disappointment, i like the main actress and that was about it... the scares are rare and not really effectives. i was bored a little, still the end is kinda cool... it seems like it's what people did not like, and it's what i like... wait for the DVD or blu-ray or better on TV for free because i'm glad i just spent 5 pennys to see this... at the regular price of 12,50$ i would have been rubbed.",The Boy

149,samgiannn,The Boy (2016),6,23 January 2016,"Not since last year's generic exorcism flick The Vatican Tapes have I had such low expectations for a movie. Its January release date, unflattering trailer, and awful director (William Brent Bell, director of The Devil Inside and Stay Alive) seemed to be a recipe for disaster. Maybe it's because my expectations were so low, but The Boy is actually a halfway-decent January thriller. The Boy is about an American woman, Greta, who becomes a nanny for a boy named Brahms whose parents will be away for a few months. What Greta comes to find out is that Brahms is actually a life-sized porcelain doll that is used to replace the real Brahms who died in a fire when he was 8. A list of rules is created for Greta to follow, and increasingly disturbing events start happening when she does not follow those rules. The enormous manor that she resides in calls to mind the mansion from The Innocents, creating an interesting setting for the film. As the film progresses, Greta does begin following the rules and treats the doll like a real boy, and it is pretty creepy seeing how the doll can mentally control her in that way. The plot itself is rather thing, specifically during the second act. There is an abusive husband sub-plot thrown into the film like last year's disappointing Sinister 2, but instead of being ridiculously over- the-top like that movie, the side plot actually does serve some relevance in The Boy and is believable enough. It provides a reason for why Greta becomes so attached to Brahms. The big twist at the end will divide viewers, but I thought it served the rest of the movie well. It is revealed that Brahms actually survived the fire and has been living in the walls ever since the incident, and the parents committed suicide and left Greta for Brahms. The fact that he's always in the walls listening and watching everything creates a creepy atmosphere. The Boy certainly won't blow anyone's minds, but it is a decent thriller that should give you an excuse to go out to the cinema in January.",The Boy

Then again, if they did, I guess there wouldn't be much of a movie. The Boy tries to be a haunted house movie, and a killer doll movie at the same time, and I think this is its greatest pitfall. If it had chosen one or the other, it could have been so much better than the final product turned out to be. This movie relies too heavily on jump scares, therefore not making it a truly horrifying movie. You know the kind. Things suddenly slam shut, something's standing behind someone when it wasn't two seconds ago, are they dreaming or not moments, etc. I give this movie credit for trying to be scary, but it falls flat.

155,RLTerry1,"Boy, that was scary!",5,1 February 2016,"Quite possibly among the scariest movies in recent years; that is until The Boy drops the ball in the last few minutes of the movie. Within the first few minutes of the film, there is already an overwhelming sense of dread and an anticipation of what horror lies in store for our protagonist. This is one of the films where the plot was nearly perfect and even scarily close to real horrific circumstances. Quite interestingly and uncharacteristic of this sub genre of horror, the previews do not give away all the scares nor do they lend to revealing the shocking turning point during the climax of the story. In many ways, the plot is a tribute to a more classic way of building a horror movie and I can appreciate the effort to channel the Master of Suspense.The Boy is about an American nanny who takes a unique position with an old-money family in the British countryside to look after the couple's son while they are on a long awaited holiday. Upon meeting the child, Greta (Lauren Cohan) is perplexed as to why mom and dad are treating a porcelain doll as if he was their son. According to the parents, the doll IS their son and Greta must follow a strict set of instructions in order to satisfy the needs of Brahms (the boy). Worried she will be alone in this mansion with only the doll for company, Greta meets the attractive local grocery delivery man Malcolm (Rupert Evans) who informs Greta of the history of Brahms and his parents. Thinking that Brahms is merely a doll with obsessed parents, it isn't long before Greta begins to feel that something is quite wrong after hearing voices and the doll mysteriously moving from place to place. Join Greta and Malcolm as they come too close to a long-kept secret with a devastating history.Despite being a January horror movie, The Boy had my attention and respect for a job well done until the end. Often horror movies may not provide us with the ending that we anticipated or were prepared for, but this film really took a turn for the worse when it played out in the manner in which it did. What I find remarkable about this modern old-school tale is the instant feeling of dread or fear of the unknown from the very beginning. From the dialog to the characters, each element of the story helps to continue to reinforce the ominous presence that Greta feels in the house. Unfortunately, there are just way too many unexplained, underdeveloped, and unanswered questions by the end of the movie to give the film the credit that it would have received otherwise. It is possible that the studio is setting up the audience for a prequel or a sequel, but usually these January movies do not see future installments.I really enjoyed the old-school pacing and feel of the movie, and if you also enjoy truly macabre suspense movies, then you will enjoy it for the most part (until the disappointing end). There was also a Hitchcockian air about the film; although Hitch would have directed a much better (or simply bizarre) ending and provided us with far fewer unexplained plot points. The film is definitely one that is very much enjoyed in a group setting, as is the case for horror in general. So, if you don't have anything else planned to see this weekend, grab a few friends and head out to see what The Boy has in store for you.",The Boy

157,kimheniadis,"Done very well, final reveal not shocking, but still good.",7,21 May 2016,"Going into this film I wasn't sure what to expect since the advertising for it was vague. The movie does a great job keeping you guessing. Is the doll actually alive, or perhaps an evil spirit is possessing the doll, or my personal favorite, the main character is just going crazy.The house itself plays a character in the film, besides the gorgeous architectural detail, it's huge and creepy. It lends itself nicely to the question as to what's going on. Will Greta find details in the attic, or perhaps the burnt part of the house where the son died. Or did she get herself into a Scooby-Doo situation, and the house is filled with secret passages.The parents of Brahms are great characters too, although we don't see much of them because they leave on vacation shortly after Greta gets there. The mom seems completely crazy, and the father just seems resigned that this is his life. Greta should have known something was up when a mom who is so dedicated to her son to just leave him with an almost stranger. But Greta has issues of her own, and is glad she can just hide out, without having to do much. Greta's issue comes into play later on, and only adds to the wonderful build-up of tension in this film.At first I was going to give this film four stars, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I really did like it. There were jump scares that were done very well, the actors were very talented, the tension and music was used wonderfully, and the final reveal (while not shocking), was good.",The Boy

160,tlooknbill,"Odd, suspenseful, creepy and a bit disturbing, but thoroughly entertaining.",9,25 January 2016,"I give it an 9 stars because the end kind of sets it up for a sequel, but hey, the rest of ""The Boy"" is beautifully stylized and paced similar to the spooky, suspenseful and disturbing '60's British made thrillers like Betty Davis' ""The Nanny""and Debra Kerr's ""The Innocents"" only with an added surprise ending and faster pace.From the trailer this movie is not what you think it is and not one of your run of the mill ""Child's Play"" Chucky doll revenge type '80's flicks. I sort of knew this going in just from the fact smart actors such as Lauren Cohan rarely make bad decisions on movie choices such as this and by god she makes it all believable just as she does in ""Walking Dead"".This is a very maturely written, photographed and acted movie reminding me of a really good Twilight Zone episode that gradually unfolds revealing the layers of mystery in this case on the reasons for why an elderly couple would be caring for a life size boy doll which is disturbing on its own right from the get go.There'll be more questions than answers as the movie progresses where the end will allow the viewer to fill in the blanks with an implied causality from connecting the dots looking back which is the best way to write a movie and view it. Don't explain everything. The audience has a better imagination and intellect.This will probably be a classic as time goes on as I believe ""The Orphan"" both odd and unique thrillers.",The Boy

The premise is creepy and immediately hooks you. The ending is fantastic. Some reviewers are complaining, but you can't expect a film to be 100% realistic. IMO the plot made enough sense and worked well. There is no horror film that mirrors real life exactly. Overall, NOT what you expect, but in a good way!",The Boy
162,iamianiman,Better than Annabelle but still...,3,22 January 2016,"one of the worst horror movies out there.If you liked Annabelle, I can guarantee that you will like this movie. But if it's the other way around, don't waste your 90 minutes to watch this movie unless if it's for that hottie woman in The Walking Dead.The first 10 minutes was pretty engaging but nevertheless, it just went down the hill just until the climax scene appeared.The final scene came back with a good plot twist. It's totally different from Chucky or Annabelle. You may find some definite clues to puzzle the twist, but at the end, you will find the shocking truth behind the curtains.Let's just skip to the jump scare parts, all I can say is that throughout the whole movie, there were only about 6 cheap, cringe- worthy jump scares.The best part was not the movie itself, but in the cinema that I rarely experienced before. Saw it with my friends, we got bored until we made laughs off that movie, we would laugh on almost every scene. Note that the cinema was packed of only 25+ people. If you want to have a good laugh, watch it at midnight or go to a remote cinema with your boisterous members and you will feel the joy of happiness.",The Boy
163,ryanmark-57919,I was Hoping for More but Still Enjoyable,6,26 January 2016,"I was really looking forward to this movie after those surprisingly creepy trailers but the actual film didn't scare me as much as I thought it would. To be fair, it's difficult to actually frighten people but there's something about this movie that just felt disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and everything but it felt like more could have been done with the whole idea. I also have to admit, the ending left me a bit lukewarm. That being said, it was still entertaining enough and I thought the director, William Brent Bell, did a decent enough job. Let's talk about the story.Greta (Lauren Cohan) has just moved to the UK for a nanny job that pays surprisingly well and is located in a secluded and spooky mansion in the middle of nowhere (it is a horror movie after all). Things get weird fast when it's revealed that the child she's supposed to look after is a porcelain doll named Brahms. This is all a bit freaky but Greta agrees to watch over Brahms while his parents are out of town since the job seems easy enough and the pay is pretty good. Unfortunately, things start to get even stranger and Greta soon suspects that there's more to this doll than meets the eye.I don't have any complaints about the acting in the film. Cohan does a great job as a tough but scared young woman stuck in a situation she doesn't fully comprehend. She probably has enough practice from her work on The Walking Dead. I also enjoyed Rupert Evans as the likable and sort of desperate Malcolm. He definitely helps to add a little levity to the whole thing. I even really liked the creepy old couple played by Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle. There are a few more people in the film but this is honestly the bulk of the cast right here. Cohan basically carries this movie for the most part.The mansion is a little spooky and the area is decently secluded but it never really feels like Greta is alone at all. Obviously we suspect the doll is doing some weird stuff behind the scenes but the mansion is in pristine condition which makes it feel like housekeepers shouldn't be too far away at any given time. Everything is shot well but it just doesn't feel like she's that secluded and in turn it feels a lot less dangerous in the house. Maybe the frequent visits from Malcolm make it feel like she's not that far from help and in turn it doesn't come off frightening to me.I'm going to get into spoiler territory pretty heavy in the next paragraph so be warned before you keep reading. I thought the film was decent for the most part but I really didn't like the ending to the movie. Basically, it turns out Brahms has been living in the walls of the mansion and is responsible for all the weird stuff that has been happening throughout the story. The reveal of Brahms was pretty freaky right at first but then the whole tone of the film changes as Brahms suddenly becomes a slasher villain. I swear this guy just reminded me of a more chatty version of Michael Myers. I mean the guy is huge and able to dish out and take some punishment and wears a creepy mask while he chases people. The situation would be frightening but it's been done so many times before. Whether it was a doll or the actual Brahms, the movie just wasn't very scary and felt a bit cliché to me. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the movie for what it was but I guess I expected something different after the trailers.I honestly thought this film would be a lot scarier than it was and I think that may have soured me a little bit on the movie but I still found it to be enjoyable. It's nowhere near the best horror film out there but it's worth a watch if nothing else is on. I think some of the fans of the genre might want to check it out for a different take on a tried and true formula but otherwise I'd recommend something else.",The Boy
164,jjenk911,Everything You Think You Know Gets Thrown Out the Window,7,25 July 2020,To make a review short and simple: most of the movie plays out as a lifelike doll that appears to be alive. About the 10-15 minutes turns about to Brahms was alive the entire time. He killed a girl during his birthday party. So the parents make up a story that Brahms died in a fire to cover up what their son did. It's a slow burn ghost story that turns into something much different. Stay with it.,The Boy
165,hnhnyc,Should've been titled WTF. Positive reviews scarier than movie.,1,12 October 2017,"I'm moved to write this review, though it'll probably get lost in a sea of others, because everyone's claim of a ""crazy twist"" is what drew me to it. I love twists. Sadly, the twist here is that the ending was such a deflated balloon of crap that I almost turned it off and I didn't. The twist is that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and didn't keep my eyes on the runtime. The twist is that I have more patience than I thought I did. Surprise!The only way other folks could possibly claim that this movie had a twist at the end is if they were tripping on something strong at the time AND thought they were either watching a drama or romantic comedy. Then, maybe, the nonsense that transpires would be surprising. It is not scary. It's not disturbing. It's not creepy. It doesn't build tension over time. Nobody's actions ever ultimately make sense unless you do a ton of digging through the review boards to try to find answers, and even then, it's admittedly full of holes. The really sad thing is it has me longing for the stupid decisions people make in scary movies that DO lead to some sort of fright, even if it's a cheap jump scare. It's not even just that the ending disappoints, it's an entire premise that sort of makes us feel like jerks for sticking around for the whole thing.What everyone has said about plot holes, both within the world of the movie and the real world, is spot on. What they have said about missed potential to portray this differently and under another genre is also a good call. I watched one doll movie over the last few months that really got me, and a couple that focused more on an entity around the doll that were decent. Guys, skip this one. Read the reviews with the spoilers and save yourself an hour, then spend that hour doing something more exciting than watching this film, like watering your freaking plants.",The Boy

167,JontheLobsterLover,"A smooth suspenseful ride, then a sharp turn downhill",7,22 January 2016,"The Boy started off pretty decent. It was a slow out of the gates for sure, but the suspense was definitely there, and it was really great at keeping you guessing: Is the boy alive? Is he haunted? Is everyone just psycho? As the movie progressed it got better. I was on the edge of my seat, and then it took a sudden turn in a direction I was really hoping they wouldn't go. I don't think the idea for the twist at the end is awful. However, I do think that the movie would have been better if they went an alternate route. The slasher way they went just didn't mesh well with the rest of the movie. The acting was pretty much a bell curve, and I base this on three of the characters. The guy who plays Cole, the violent, obsessive, ex- boyfriend did a lousy job. Even at playing a jerk, he sucked. The woman playing Greta was for the most part, decent. She had really high moments. She also very much had her low moments. The man playing Malcolm was amazing, in my opinion. Probably the one truly believable actor in the whole movie.A decent movie overall.",The Boy

A possessed doll, yeah thats pretty unoriginal but that twist, I'm usually good at seeing them coming and i didn't see that. And i don't think many others did either (no matter what they claim)Reminds me of a movie called Bad Ronald that I saw when I was young.

171,pendenquejohn,Started well and then fell flat...,4,28 December 2016,"I appreciate horror movies and I initially thought this one had potential. Well, it started quite well, though with the usual suspect moving to a new place that reveals itself to be haunted with some kind of unlimited spirit.However, build up took a lot time before we got some decent action. One has to admit that the overall thing was kind of slow which makes it kind of annoying at times and can probably bring a lot of people to quit.Thank God Lauren Cohan's aggressive boyfriend came in at some time to put a little bit of spice in the story when he was just an abstract element. From that specific moment, the movie did gain a little bit more interest.I did find that there were some ""scary"" parts due to the way the movie plays with the spectator's psychology. There are a lots of suggestions that kept you guessing, well, much as expected with a ""horror"" movie but unfortunately, some of this was kind of killed later on. During the movie, I started really having doubts on Rupert Evans, something which gave the feeling that I did not really know where this whole thing was going. I would probably qualify that as a strong point.Indeed, it also played against me because I was kind of deceived that ""The boy"" finally was not some sort of ghost intervention reincarnated through a dull (well, I know this subject had been touched so many times but I guess that's what I was expecting). Instead, it was a grown man acting like an idiotic ""child"" (or whatever that was). It was reminiscent of ""Jason"" or anyways there was some kind of inspiration from that going on there but it was much less impressive. From a pure logical stance, I fail to see any connection whatsoever between the porcelain dull and that grown man. Anyways, through all of this, we do discover that finally this whole haunted thing was just a complete farce.Something to note that did not make much sense concerning the suicidal of ""The Boy's"" parents. Movies like these are always quite fundamentally annoying. So the girl has the opportunity to escape and save her life but decides to come back for some reason -; well, we do know why and for sole purpose of doing that romance-thing.On the acting itself, I'm not totally convinced by Lauren Cohan's skills in the action skills. I did find her a bit limited and unfortunately for her, a good share of the emotions she tried to convey were a little bit forced. She sometimes shifted from a state to another in way to unconventional ways for it to be true especially when she was portrayed as a stable person looking for some sort of balance in her life.I would not qualify the movie as bad, it is actually quite good and decently produced. I've seen much worse movies but it's certainly not a chef d'oeuvre. I'd say this one is specific for those who are not into horror stuff but still want to explore some of that universe without getting out of their comfort zones. If you are fan of the genre, then you might probably consider this as a semi-flop.I personally rate this as equally as ""Mechanic"", which I saw recently. Not bad but not extraordinarily great.",The Boy

A fairly well directed movie with nice photography, a good score, and a nice lead performance. It has an interesting and weird premise and it moves along at a steady clip and I rather enjoyed myself during its ninety-something minutes. I could have lived without the jump scare dream cliche - once, maybe, but twice, never. I've seen so much lousy junk lately, and yes that includes the dopey super-hero movies - this one's a masterpiece compared to that idiocy - that whenever I see something that's at least competently done, I'm happy.

The second the score began at the beginning of the film, I was loving it. Awesome creepy music. The lead actress from 'The Walking Dead' is amazing and plays the part perfectly, I think we'll be seeing a lot of her in the future. The whole movie you will spend trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I felt that the mid section of the movie starts to fall a little flat but that only makes the twist even more brilliant.

178,MikeWright75,One of the better creepy doll movies,10,17 August 2018,"I'm a fan of creepy doll movies but only when they're done well. And done well creepy doll movies are pretty thin on the ground. The Boy gets it right at deeper psychological levels because even though you know from the get go that being employed as a nanny to a life sized boy doll would have most women running for the hills, there's something tragic and poignant about the elderly couple who dote so lovingly over the angelic looking porcelain ""Brahms"" The newly employed Greta has her own problems, having lost a baby herself, so after the initial scorn of pandering to Brahm's every whim,, and when seemingly supernatural happenings occur around the doll, she strikes up a Freudian rapport with her charge and starts to really care for it. Now, this is what I have a real problem with as Greta is a fairly well balanced, strong female escaping to England to get away from her nasty violent ex boyfriend. There's not enough emotional damage in this character to warrant her connection with the doll. She's not needy enough, or fragile enough. The real show stopper is when the real Brahms, the adult Brahms, reveals himself by oozing out of a mirror in one of the creepiest reveals in movies. I didn't see it coming.The real Brahams might have been better portrayed as a podgy, flabby mewling adult baby with pallid skin and bald as a mushroom. Instead we have a tall, slim, hairy chested hottie who, in spite of the dirty vest, doll mask and Rigsby cardy, has already set the internet alight with blogs about his sex appeal. Whether this is intentional or not on the part of the director, I don't know. But I guess it makes the character all the more fascinating and it would have been interesting for him to have had more screen time and more in depth scrutiny of his psychology. Instead, the end of the movie falls into the generic slasher comes a cropper but doesn't die category, leaving it wide open to a sequel that probably won't happen. And that's a shame because had there been more to the murderous Brahms than his psycho temper this might have been possible.It would have had more impact if the script had revolved more around the psychologically damaged element of Greta and Brahms. A kind of twisted love story that worked so well in the 1960's movie, The Haunting. Instead the final denouement is a bog standard plot device.A good movie though and decent performances from the leads. James Russell has the difficult job of portraying Brahms, with most of the acting in the eyes. If you watch closely he doesn't blink once, but still manages to exude a child like vulnerability even at his most murderous.",The Boy

180,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,I Lost A Couple Brain Cells,3,23 January 2016,"The Boy is directed by William Brent Bell and written by Stacey Menear. It stars Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, and James Russell.An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll. After violating a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive.I truly loved The Boy. This was one of the funniest and most original movies I have ever seen. From the the psychotic doll that wouldn't scare a 2 year old to zero gravitational towel to a fridge that is seemingly two dimensional, this movie had my friends and me cracking up. I then looked at the IMDb page and saw the tags ""Horror, Thriller."" How?I find it a bit too easy to just rip apart a movie this inept, therefore I find it necessary confess that The Boy isn't the worst horror movie in recent memory to pop out of January, and does feature some strong points even if these points can only be found out by digging around in miles and miles of horror movie excretion. Most of these strong points are thanks to director, William Brent Bell's moderately entertaining choices. Choosing to minimize the amount we see the ""doll"" he manages to create an amiable albeit completely unremarkable psychological thriller that revolves around paranoia. With that said, he fails to scare the audience as he relies way too heavily on jump scares to create urgency and tension. Though Bell is horribly devoted, his passion can't even come close to compensate for this movies lurid and wholly irritating script and characters.From the first time our squeaky and overly polished protagonist opens her mouth and the resulting slow motion sequence, I was sure I was in for something. The resulting 90 minutes of utter hilarity was mostly attributed to the shockingly dreadful script that featured incoherency in tone, character development, and plot. Uninspired and lacking any real motive, writer Stacey Menear weaves together a yarn that is irrevocably ludicrous. One of my largest issues with The Boy's script, laid in the incredibly jumbled tone which made it impossible for the actors and audience to decipher the seriousness behind pivotal scenes. Menear also struggles with character development. Unable to forge a dramatic core that's truly compelling, Menear resorts to juvenile character building techniques.Perhaps my largest gripe with The Boy stems from the fact that this movie could have been compelling. Though filled to the brim with cliché galore, at the 45 minute mark a character realization takes place that seemed out of place, by that I mean out of formula. For the next fifteen minutes we, the audience, were treated to some original twists that really worked. This new found focus was instantly broken with an ending ""twist"" so incredibly generic and stupid that turned what ever progress this movie made null and void, and thoroughly illogical. What a shame.The Boy's director and cast admirably attempt to showcase their talent but are ultimately let down by an incoherent and unoriginal script. The Boy gets a D+ or a 3/10.",The Boy

Director William Brent Bell does a great job creating a creepy atmosphere. The problems in the film lie with the script. The dialogue in the film is very subdued, and there are no truly memorable lines.

The main character's evolution is one example of why I found the movie unappealing. There was no cohesion.The story starts with a quirky couple about to leave, supposedly on vacation, so they hire a nanny to take care of their son, who turns out to be a doll. There is a list of tasks she must perform with the doll everyday or bad things will happen. At least that's what the trailed led me to believe.For me, the highlight of the movie was precisely watching that couple and how each handled the doll. The entire set was lovely as well, both the house and the few surroundings we get to see.Even though the film had its moments, there isn't nearly as much suspense as I had hoped. Or rather, it felt like all the suspense's resolution was saved till the end, in a sequence that came across as jumbled and nonsensical.SPOILER: First of all, why would that ridiculous list matter? I found no connection to the way the plot developed at all. Seems to me like things were bound to go bat crazy at any point, list following or otherwise. Also, if Brahms was really an adult, how come she heard a kid's voice every now and then? Calling her name, so it couldn't be a recording from the past. And finally, was there anything supernatural about the guy at all? The mask was all sparkly and he seemed inhumanely strong but the story seems to point towards him living locked up his whole life in the walls of the house. The supernatural strength doesn't really make much sense, does it? END SPOILERIf I am going to wait that long to have resolution, it better make me drop my jaw. It didn't. Not even close.I just cannot recommend this one.",The Boy

191,jezfernandez,Grows on you,7,6 August 2016,"I watched this a few nights ago and quite enjoyed it. However, I felt the twist robbed the film of its initial edge. With further reflection, it's actually a rather clever plot that works well.Brahms himself is a nicely designed prop - innocent and malevolent in equal measure, though he remains an inanimate doll throughout. Cohan's performance is solid, though I felt the script could have explored the theme of isolation and paranoia a little more.Overall, this is a welcome addition to the haunted house/creepy doll genre and packs a coherent twist by the end. Creepy and thought-provoking - well worth a look.",The Boy
192,erolsabadosh,Not very good,4,6 April 2016,"The Boy is a story about an American babysitter who takes a job in England for an old couple with a son who turns out to actually be a doll. Or is he? As strange things begin to happen in the house our heroine, played by Lauren Cohan, starts to believe that the doll may have a life of its own.The film attempts to create an atmosphere of suspense but frankly I found it far more funny than scary. If you want to watch something so stupid that it makes you laugh then this could be a fun way to pass the time but after laughing at the first hour of the film I fell asleep as it just didn't hold my attention until the end. If you want an entertaining evil doll horror watch Chuckie, or even Anabelle.

194,mr_waterfall,Real review of The Boy,1,18 December 2016,"I am a big fan of anything evil dolls or creepy dummies. Even if like them the best and they can have different ideas to them. I rented The Boy at Family Video i was gonna go see it with my mom. But didn't have the money at the time to see it. Well here is a real review of The Boy.Again they can have different ideas to a Dummy or Doll movie and make it good and different, this movie ""Nope."" Here you got a good buildup to a great movie, the Doll showing up in spots you think its a live Ya!!!! But, Wait there's more! Nope, What you got here is a half the movie build to a nothing. Its just the boy really older and he killed his friend, because hes some Michael Myers form of a kid, that is looney. His parents protect him hide him in some wall, and place the doll around to have the life he wished he had, which means The Boy and everything spooky or cool about it is all just some lame, i wish i had this life mentality.Total Let down, if people like this thats fine, to each their own. But to me just put a sticker on it saying The Boy the whole evil doll thing is just some looney killer kid that grown up and wants someone to have his is mommy, to me it looked more like a cartoon goofiness after it was revealed of this kid killer in wall thing, to me anyway just seemed like cheap, and a BIG let down, but to each their own, if love this. TO me i want some killer doll or have some unique thing other than a regular down being plaacd around the house just because some looney kid grew up and wants to have a family he cant have since hes a murderer. I mean i hate it my family i told said that is Cheap! I said i know. Lame. Very very Lame.",The Boy

196,sukanya-samy,More dolls! Ugghh.,4,28 October 2016,"Note – No spoilers, so read on. First reviewed on broth of blogs.The toughest thing for a parent is to see their child die before them – Anonymous.The PlotThe Boy (2016) gives a whole different meaning to the sentence above. It is about the Heelshires, an old English couple living in a big house in the middle of nowhere (it could be countryside New York if not for the accents). They hire a nanny, Greta Evans (played by Lauren Cohen of The Walking Dead fame) to look after their small boy, Brahms. But what do you know? Brahms is not a boy at all, it is a life size doll.The story proceeds thereon where Greta plays along because she has moved to a whole different continent to escape her abusive boyfriend/father of her dead child. The Heelshires leave for a vacation with a cryptic 'I am sorry' from the Mrs. There are rules to look after the doll and they warn her not to break them.But considering the boy is a doll and Greta is alone, she prefers to NOT follow the rules to look after him which includes kiss him goodnight. Mysterious things start happening then on and Greta is absolutely certain that the doll is alive or possessed by the real Brahms who died in a fire as a child. In comes Malcolm (Rupert Evans) and they discover the truth about Brahms, the boy/the doll/the spirit – whatever you want to call it. On the other hand, the Heelshires take a dip in the pond with stones in their pockets which screams SUICIDE.More dolls anyone?Now, there are lots of movies that have been made on dolls (Chucky series, Dead Silence, more recently Annabelle) and I can't for the love of the world understand why anybody would have a life size doll in their house. But this story at-least has an explanation. The Heelshires, not being able to cope with their son's death, actually believe that the doll which looks like him, is their son – they are half mad with grief. But that is not the whole truth.And thenThe rest of the movie is complete nonsense. The third act will leave you puzzled and when you try to piece together the puzzle at the end, you would realize that the end was just plain stupid. The crew should have continued on 'the doll is possessed' track. Having said that, the setting is good, there are no crazy jump scenes and are actual ones where the mood and the sounds go together well and Cohen and Evans do a good job of what they have been given.The Boy is a horror turned to humorous turned to 'what the hell happened here' kinda movie.

I rated this movie with an eight because honestly I didn't really see much wrong with the film. The character development was mostly good, the story developed to be much better than I expected, the acting, editing, lighting, sound, everything was just better than I figured.The film does start off a bit slow for about the first twenty minutes or so but it picks up and runs faster and gets far more intense and entertaining. The end of the film is great as well. I can't say weather it's really a horror film because it felt more like a thriller than anything.

This film keeps you on the edge of your seat and always make you wonder what's going to happen next. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is tired of the same old cliché horror movies.

200,meganmarie-19902,Reminisces 60's Classics,7,16 November 2018,"As horror fans, we cannot lie that over the past few years, horror films have become somewhat mundane, to the fact that we are immune to creepy dolls, a scary house and babysitters. The Boy has each of those elements, but it is produced in such a way that it keeps its originality and even pays homage to the 60s British thrillers. Greta has fled to Britain from America to escape her abusive boyfriend. Whilst in the beautiful British countryside, Greta has landed a nannying role for a wealthy couple to help look after their son Brahms. When Greta arrives, not only is the mansion in the middle of nowhere, Brahms is in actual fact a porcelain doll. As the couple leaves to go on holiday, Greta is left with strict instruction on how to care for Brahms. However, failure to follow the rules has led our young American to receive a threatening phone call and unexplainable supernatural activity around the house. Is Brahms really just an innocent doll or is Greta losing her mind?......

201,fatref350,It's Scary (that anyone would think this is a good movie!),1,16 May 2016,"Words can't describe how awful this movie was...but I'll try. First off, there was nothing original about the plot, except the last 15 minutes when we find out that Brahms is not a spirit. He is actually a burned, maniacal man-child living in the walls, killing young girls and dictating the rules of the house. The doll was creepy, yes, but not at all scary. There was no sense of suspense, danger, fear, or ""Oh God, what's gonna happen next?"" The acting was very sub-par; cardboard cutouts reading ridiculous dialog. The sets, music and camera work were not at all ominous. Oh, you want clichés? How about a girl in the shower being stalked? A rainy night? A shadow on the wall? A telephone that keeps ringing and no one is there? Getting locked in the attic? Creeping around at night with a candle while in a house that has electricity and plenty of light switches?

There were a few loud noise jump scares here and there but if you're like me and you don't find dolls that scary this movie will be low on the fear factor. I know most horror movie characters make bad decisions but the ones in this movie are particularly bad! The mean ex boyfriend was badly acted and honestly, asking a ""possessed"" doll to take care of him for you?? That was one of the decisions that put me over the edge. I at least will sleep soundly at night, having no worries about little dolls coming to get me. Honestly, what's the worry? Just yeet him across the room and gtf out of there.

206,FJWWindsor,A Bit of a Let-Down,5,17 August 2017,"The Boy is an entertaining movie for about 3/4 of its length, presenting the viewer with an atmospheric creepiness reminiscent of 1978's MAGIC or the Annabelle/Conjuring series. William Brent Bell did it right by commissioning a premium quality doll, almost lifelike in its presentation. He furthers the unease by posing the doll in unique sets and shots that stay with you (for example, who can forget the boy perched on the edge of his bed, looking out into the hallway?. Or sitting in the fancy upholstered chair? Or at the kitchen table?)However, the movie eventually falls into trite and predictable mechanisms. And once they start, they pile up. The new love interest. The sudden appearance of the abusive boyfriend. And, of course, the emergence of the boy who never really died, and the subsequent chase through a darkened house.How was this predictable? The film makers virtually hit you over the head with it, stressing two or three times that The Boy was eight years old when he died twenty years ago. It's almost as if they're telling the viewer to ""do the math"", so that when the boy appears as a sheltered adult, it's actually anti-climactic. Still, I gave it five stars for its technique early in the film. I suppose any other ending would have been just as trite. There's only so much you can do with a ""doll"" film.",The Boy
207,Duchino,"In the 'Creepy Doll' category: nothing great, but sufficiently entertaining",6,12 April 2016,"Lauren Cohan is a hottie, first of all. She's famous as 'Maggie' in ""The Walking Dead"" and it's a pleasure to see her in a full feature that doesn't completely suck. As a horror it ain't much, since it's more of the usual, but it does measure its movements to not be as corny as many other genre examples. As a creepy thriller it's not that bad, but it'll just scare impressionable viewers. The way the story turns, in the end, is half predictable and not too lazy, but still nothing original or effectively haunting. For a way better watch, I strongly suggest ""The Orphanage"" (2007) which is a much better story and has everything this does not.",The Boy
208,shreeree,She deserved whatever...,6,16 April 2016,"I figure the chose to make Greta American for the film because of our bad reputation of ""rudeness and disrespect of others property"" when we travel abroad (such as signing your name on historical monuments or landscape). Unfortunately,there have been enough truth to make the stereotypical behavior used often in crossover horror films used in all of them with American visiting characters.Maybe because I played with Barbies as a child and being an only child, I felt they were my friends so at first I felt angry at Greta's behavior. I'm still an adult collector because of the dolls importance to my childhood so it doesn't have to be important to anyone else but if for instance I pay you good money to keep my dolls house dusted everyday, you should do it even if you think it's stupid or turn down the job.For this reason I think Greta deserved to get spooked. The doll was real to these people and she should have respect that as if she was caring for a disabled child. At least in the beginning. It wasn't like she had to make it up as she went along. Just follow the rules until you realize they weren't coming back. Then get the hell out of there since you were paid enough for a ticket home or a hotel in town.Now considering what the parents had planned I didn't understand why they didn't just take ""The Doll"" with them instead of saddling an unsuspected person with the task.I was confused that is until the haunting movie I thought it was went from a great British Gothic horror film of a spiritual love between parents and a(deceased)child to a typical American Gore film which was disappointing. I think this is why so many hated it. However thought it was better than some horror films I've seen lately due to the atmosphere set from the beginning if they had followed through with the haunting and let it end with the ghost child choosing new parents it would have been way better, I think.",The Boy

He is just a very spoiled brat and has ""tantrums"" when something is not as he likes- for instance he begins blaring loud music when the nanny is about to have sex with the grocery delivery guy she has been vibing with.

Did we just become best friends? Yup! Just like Brahms and Greta, I mean who wouldn't befriend a life-sized doll who appears to have a spirit living inside of it? That always seems like a good idea. The movie started off s l o w l y but it did eventually find it's pace and plotline. Meet Brahms, the ""8 year old"" boy that Greta has traveled around the world to babysit. Let's face it, she's running from her ex back in the states and a desolate village in merry ole England is the perfect solution (or so she thinks). Brahms elderly parents introduce him to Greta and at this moment you can see her disbelief. He's a porcelain doll that is carried around like a real boy and is treated just as any 8 year old boy would be. So pretty much he's got the perks Pinocchio was never privy to!
This is when things turn dicey. Brahms starts moving ""on his own"" and making Greta peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

A young American woman takes a job as a nanny to an elderly couple's child in Britain. Only when she gets to their large, creepy mansion does she learn the ""boy"" is really a doll that the couple treats as if it is alive and their son. Much of what ensues after this is fairly predictable. We know the doll is going to end up doing creepy things, or at least we'll be led to believe this is the case. We also know there will be something more going on than what meets the eye. Lauren Cohan does a very good job, which is essential because she has to carry most of the movie. Many scenes are with her and the doll alone. Also, the setting and the doll itself do a great job of creating the mood. The film does well at holding the viewer's attention; however, once we see the final ""twist"" we understand that it was really the only reasonable explanation--although it is really not all that reasonable. There are a few scenes where the dialog and impact fall a little flat.

Not to say that this one is bad, but it's not flawless. I feel like the entirety of the movie would have been good if it continued with the ""possessed doll"" feel to it to the very end. The twist ending, while it makes sense, is kind of what killed this movie for me. I do give it a 7/10 for great acting, amazing cinematography, a fantastic script, and outstanding pacing. The twist did make the ending bad, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable to watch.If you liked this movie, I recommend a New Zealand movie that feels similar, but it's a dark comedy, called Housebound.",The Boy
219,tdevil9,A refreshing mish-mash,8,6 April 2016,"The Boy really shines as a standalone horror flick. However, it is not original. The script owes a debt to three (possibly 4) old horror films. Two that are successful brands and the other, not well known at all but underrated. There are several glaring holes such as people being able to enter a house that would normally have been locked. There is also an unexplained scene concerning the Parents that I won't describe, since this is supposed to be a spoiler free review. For the budget, it is certainly worth a watch, and the scares are far better quality that the average slasher flicks. The pacing of the film is just right and the conclusion was neither ambiguous nor cheesy. The acting was perfect for a horror film.",The Boy

Dolls are creepy and therefore a movie about a doll is supposed to be creepy and this movie nailed it. A lot of people complain about the ending, some say that they don't like how it wasn't actually the doll being possessed by a spirit, and I've even read some reviews from some.... Not very smart people.... Who somehow totally missed the fact that the man was the ""dead"" boy. He killed a little girl when he was 8. His parents were ashamed, hid him in the walls, and I believe they created doll to replace their ""odd"" boy. They locked the real guy up, never saw him, fed him through the walls, he had a bunch of holes he made over time that led to the inside of the house. The parents were scared of him too, so they made sure to comply with all his requests: loud music so he can hear it behind the walls. Living in isolation for 20 years behind the walls would obviously drive someone intensely mad, not to mention he was odd to start out with. Obsessive, creepy, weird. The doll was his creepy way of being loved and accepted by his parents, and as he hoped, by a woman. So he lived through the doll for 20 years. It's the story of an isolated family with a dark secret, an even more isolated and insane man who just wanted to be loved, and lived through the more lovable and accepted doll, and was murderous against anyone who rejected him. Creepy. And successful. Anyone who dislikes this movie probably wanted super scary, and it did have a couple scary moments, or they wanted poltergeist chuckie demon doll, which no offense, but that is silly. It makes it way more cool for it to not be paranormal but just a really f'ed up family in the middle of nowhere.",The Boy

223,SofiaParkJeon,It's great but there's something missing,7,26 September 2016,"***Major Spoilers ahead***I really liked this movie. Some of the scary scenes were really scary, there were a few jump scenes, the atmosphere was right for a good horror movie, the doll was a mix of sweet and scary and I loved the way that Greta holds the doll when she realizes it might be alive. The scene where the Greta's ex broke the doll was really good, I literally sat on the couch with my hands on my mouth, this was probably the best scene in the entire movie.The performances weren't great, by none of the actors but they weren't terrible either.That being said the plot holes are a bit too many. Many questions to be answered:Whhy did the parents hide Brahms behind the walls? - Why did Brahms kill the little girl (assuming it was him)? - Why did the parents made up a story about a doll that had rules, like ""goodnight kiss"" if the real Brahms was actually alive? Did he get excited by seeing people kissing the doll?Well, after all the movie was very entertaining, the twist was good and it's worth a watch.",The Boy
224,JamiroBontes,The Boy is an interesting movie for sure,5,12 March 2017,"Greta played by Lauren Cohan needs to babysit a doll from two older people. She thinks its a joke but as she finds out that the doll is maybe poss-est by a little boy who died years ago.The first act of this movie I toughed it was okay because they let you she what the doll does when you don't do what stands on the list that says how you should treat it. So I toughed it was alright.The second act I think is brilliant, she suddenly realizes that if you do what it wants it doesn't do anything scary. Greta sees the boy as her child and treats him like that. You see that she really starts to care about him. At this point I toughed that I was seeing a really brilliant 'horror' movie.The third act is what ruined this movie Greta's ex boyfriend with who she had problems with comes to the house and to make a long story short they get into a fight what leads to the ex boyfriend destroying the doll. You see the wall burst and a men climbs out of the wall he kills the ex boyfriend and Greta runs away. She sees that the boy was never a doll and lived in the walls she runs away keeping the man alive.I think the twist at the end was really weird and I don't understand why the writers did it like that. The Boy is an okay movie with an alright first act, a brilliant second act and a terrible third act.",The Boy
225,rachelflowers-03467,Strange yet entertaining,9,10 June 2020,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable. It wasn't hard to predict the ending and even though i predicted it, it was still a good ending. I also want to say that i like how original this script was. When i read the summary for this movie i assumed it would be a rip off of Chucky but it wasn't. There was some really good acting in this movie too. I very much admired how the leading lady was able to act very genuine in her role for this film. I am a die hard horror fanatic so when i say that this movie impressed me, that's saying a lot. There's not a huge amount of blood or teens being slaughtered mercilessly by some monster or twisted, mutated bodies laying everywhere, but it is very creepy and thrilling psycologically. Definitely recommend.",The Boy
226,kpentlanduk,Well above average and worth your time!,8,9 April 2016,This is a slow paced film but the Director does a great job engaging you. Greta takes on a nanny job in England - creepy old English mansion. Turns out she will be looking after a porcelain lifelike doll. Now firstly you question OK GET OUT OF THAT NUTTY CREEPY HOUSE! But.... the Direction and performances are so darned solid you believe this is possible. She NEEDS the job badly and is running away from a bad situation in America. So hell why not take the job and just go along with it. What is the worst that could happen?The Boy is slow paced to start but compelling enough.... the first few jump scares are OK but jump scares are old hat and nothing new.The plot borrows many ideas from different horror films which I shall not name as it would spoil the little twist to come.... more than just a little twist actually! Some reviewers say the twist is absurd but I found myself going along with the last 30 minute ride and thoroughly enjoying it. Not perfect but polished nicely enough for a horror fan to enjoy. Creepy doll creepy movie and good to see a solid performance from Lauren Cohen proving she really can act outside of The Walking Dead.,The Boy
227,bhamiltonesq,Creepy with an unexpected twist,8,14 June 2020,I thought this one was far better than ANNABELLE. Really solid storyline and the lead actress was great.

228,swifty77,The Walking Doll,8,21 June 2016,"I went into this film with low expectations and no idea of the premise and I came out having watched what I believe to be one of my favourite horror films of the decade. Of course the haunted doll idea has been done many times before, but this was different from the outset. Brahms seemed to actually be a harmless childlike presence with a bit of an attitude and it was nice to see Lauren Cohen's character, Greta, click on to that rather quickly giving us a few nice scenes with her playing happy families with Brahms and her new grocery guy boyfriend. The setup for the end of the film was inevitable and everything gets messed up when Greta's abusive ex-boyfriend finds out where she's staying. I will say no more other than this: I didn't expect that ending. Loved this movie",The Boy

It has some gaps, and some missing story elements. I read a couple of reviews, and people complained about things not being explained and impossible scenarios. But this move was super entertaining. I did not want to turn away, it kept me glued, and was fun. What else do you really want from a horror or mystery movie? It was original, and inventive, and the acting was good. Was it a perfect movie, no... but it was definitely worth watching, and if your on the fence about it, don't be, watch it. And i am picky.",The Boy
230,redrum-03370,Had potential but blew it,3,14 May 2017,"SPOILER WARNING - This review is pretty much going to be all spoilers, so if you haven't watched the film, you must stop reading now. Seriously, this is the last warning. You shouldn't still be reading at this point. So for those of you who saw the film, I appreciated some of the plot developments and had high hopes for the movie up until the point when grown up mask-wearing Brahms crawled out of the wall. For me, that was the moment where it seemed like the filmmaker brought in a new crew of writers who were unaware of anything that had been written up until that point. Sure, it was awesome seeing big ol' not-dead Brahms murder Cole, but aside from that the movie no longer makes sense. Consider this:1. First of all, if you see a big psycho killer bust out of a wall, wearing a scary as $hiznit mask, how long would it take you to reach the exit? Right. Me too. I would outrun a cheetah.2. Seeing a masked killer crawling out of the wall in and of itself would scare the hell out of Freddie Kruger, but if the killer proceeded to attack a dangerous, violent stalker, would your first reaction be put your life on the line to defend the stalker? NO! Did Malcolm and Greta forget that Cole is dangerous and would likely kill them if he hadn't been interrupted by this new development? This was their chance to get out of that house and get away from Cole, and yet they stay and fight. Ridiculous.3. Why did the lights dim and the walls shake when Cole broke the doll?4. Since Brahms didn't die in the fire, what was the purpose of the doll if it was not housing the spirit of Brahms? 5. If the old couple knew their son was alive, living up in the attic, why did they become so attached to the doll, treating it as though it were their son? 6. In the end, why is Brahms putting the doll back together? What's the point?7. Greta stabbed Brahms in the upper abdomen twice with a long screwdriver. Those are mortal wounds. I'm not a physician but if a person has any chance of surviving such a wound I believe they would need immediate skilled medical assistance at a state of the art facility. The film established that the house was in the middle of nowhere, so are we expected to believe that Brahms just ""got better""? What... he just bucked up and walked it off? Please.In summary, it was well acted, Greta was hot, and honestly, the old broad looked pretty sexy in her tight skirt. I definitely got some visceral oedipal vibes. Her psychosis and stern demeanor only added to her allure, and it's a shame they didn't explore this at all. Other than the sexy ladies, this flick was a loser.",The Boy
231,DannyDnB,Underwhelming.,3,23 November 2016,"This January horror release is about an American woman who gets the job of babysitting a young boy in England. Little does she know about the boys true nature.It stars Lauren Cohan (The Walking Dead) as the leading lady who is tormented by the boy. She actually does an okay job, it's nothing special but rather your run-of-the-mill damsel in distress. Unfortunately the character she plays isn't very interesting at all.I was actually fairly invested during the first quarter of the movie, but oh boy, does it go astray! There are things that happen that make no sense, things that are set up which don't even get explored further, and dialogue that pushes you further away from the experience. That is my main problem with this work. It is directionless.I mean, it is an incredibly similar story to that of a recent horror film also about a creepy doll (can you guess which movie that is?) and while it doesn't really copy the exact premise of that film, one does end up with a sense that the creators of this picture were merely jumping on the craze of scary dolls, without adding anything to that craze.The Boy is a completely underwhelming horror film that doesn't many scares whatsoever and borrows the premise of other haunted doll movie.",The Boy
232,SaarahN,Enjoyable,8,21 August 2016,"I watched this film during an impromptu sleepover. After having watched multiple trailers, this film piqued our interest. And for good reason, this film is crazy creepy. We meet a young woman, Gretta, who enlists herself to work as a babysitter for an elderly couple's son. Upon arriving, she meets Malcolm- the grocery boy/man. And eventually she meets the family- only to find that their son is actually a doll and they treat 'it' as a real person. Can you imagine? And her job, she decides is only too easy- there's nothing real to look after. No real person to feed, clothe- anything. Though the couple do expect her to fulfil a list of responsibilities: 'rules'. Does she?Of course not, why would she? There's no reason for it, right? Her responsibility is a doll. Ridiculous, but still an only too easy job. But is it really....? Just remember, everything is not what it seems. And maybe, it might be wise for Gretta to follow the rules- just maybe.While this film may not have been that horrifying, it was intriguing. I love anything with a twist, and I still have questions about it. After having a debate with heavily conflicted views regarding the little details of the film, with my buddies, we have concluded that this film may not always 'add up' and satisfy your curiosity. Nonetheless 'a fun, senseless, no right answer, built wholly on assumptions' debate after a film is worth everything.The four stars is only because I engaged in a long debate, and still have no answers! And because I was seeking a film that would give me nightmares, usually that's an easy feat for a film to accomplish- but not with this film. As much as a shame that was, the film was indeed enjoyable.",The Boy

From the trailer the movie definitely seemed interesting , and it being rated 6 i expected it to be pretty good , but after setting up a good environment for the first 30 min , the movie fails miserably in inducing any scares and this is given that i was watching it by myself around midnight. i almost felt cheated in the end when i was not scared at all for even a moment and i am not immune to horror , i recently watched IT follows and it was a fantastic horror movie. Even if you are someone who watches every single horror movie , u can skip over this one (even if u just wanna see Lauren Cohen, just watch walking dead lol) 3/10 for it being so disappointing and killing my hopes for a good scary time during Halloween, SHAME!It offers bare minimum scare thats why so many people are so happy with it coz it is the first movie that let them go to bed completely relaxed and yet they could claim that they saw ""horror"" movie",The Boy
238,timaenot,Bad plot holes,5,25 January 2017,"This is not a horror movie, rather a thriller. And the thriller is not good either, because the actors are more than mediocre and the plot has inexplicable holes. The 'clever' twist undoes the complete story we have been told before, and - all the worse - it is just improbable, because with this premise, you cannot explain why the parents of the 'boy' behave the way they do. There is no good reason for watching this movie, it is just an example of bad screenplay writing and acting. There are some beautiful views of the old English manor, the unsettling doll etc., but it all makes no sense in the end.

241,annrie_1,Another good horror film ruined by the ending,4,6 April 2016,"I am really starting to get tired of seeing brilliant trailers of films and praying to the horror god that finally Hollywood has made a film which has a brilliant beginning middle and end!!Unfortunately that isn't the case with this film! From the trailer you would think this film would be on par or similar to the The conjuring Anna belle but better, but guess what.... Its not..From the fake English setting the random plot line, this film just has disappointment all over it!The beginning starts off slow as with any good horror movie to draw you in and create suspense! The story of a couple who have lost their son and the spirit possessing a doll seems a good plot in theory and for the beginning and middle of the film this actually works. there are a lot of questions which are unanswered through out the film, like what happened to the previous nanny, and what caused the fire, but it something that can be dealt with because of other things going within the film...The film turns south when the American nannies ex psycho partner comes into the frame! it was like the writers had ran out of ideas and just tried to finish the film as quickly as possible! changing the film from a ghost possessed doll to an obsessed crazy person living in the walls which we didn't see coming at all ruined the entire plot of the film! It was like Annabelle meet Texas chainsaw massacre and for some reason it just didn't work as it was all shoved into a small 20 minute slot right at the end of the film! Maybe again if they had explain or shown us that something was a miss in the house then we could forgive there rush to get this film finished! But i don't know about the rest of you but i am really tired of watching horrors and wanting to genuinely be scared and then just ending up disappointed because they have made a good scary ghost horror movie and just explain ""aliens did it"" or just ended the film with no explanation what so ever! i mean this works sometimes on films, but not when the film actually needs an ending and conclusion and not just credits! i think Hollywood needs someone to tell them when the film needs a conclusion ending and not just a cut to the credits with no explanation! it works for some not for most! Verdict for this film - good but then i would switch off after an hour into it so you keep the suspense of the film in your head and are not ruined by the Hollywood rubbish after!",The Boy
242,woodcoinmagazine,The doll is idealistic... The grown boy is a mess.,6,6 May 2020,"Moodily filmed without a ton of exposition, THE BOY entrances viewers with a life-size doll embodying the spirit of a child who died years before-- his rich parents cling to memories and coddle the doll as if it were a real kid. Yes, Lauren Cohen as nanny does a fine job joking along with the job until it becomes obvious that either the doll walks and plays tricks, or the actual son is still alive and living in the walls of the parents' mansion. Spoiler alert: the latter turns out to be true. Enter a brutish ex-boyfriend and a nerdy grocery-getter and you're in for a predictable yet thrilling climax. What is interesting, is the doll embodies the essence of a true character-- the sweating hairy psycho who's been hiding within the mansion's walls terrorizing people is less a man than a plot device, without any backstory or personality. I guess a sequel is now available? Maybe it has flashbacks. to explain? The theme of this movie puts illusion ahead of facts. It also makes men look kinda sick after puberty.",The Boy

I could have been more satisfied if that twist in the end didn't happen and if producers would have come up with a better way to solve the mystery that is more appropriate and unexpected at the same time, not unexpectedly dull.. It is definitely mysterious, entertaining and worth watching. I would just prefer a supernatural ending as the environment of the movie suggests while keeping you await excited rather than discovering that it is a story of a psycho.Still, it is better than annabelle for me. Character development of the doll is much better than some of the movies ""human"" characters. There comes a time in the movie and you almost become sure that it is the time when little brahms would show signs of being alive in front of the audience. I can even radically say that the lead actor not lauren cohen.

The remaining portion goes out if its way to destroy the entire feel, mood, and plausibility that was initially setup.

248,Anrachman,Love it,10,12 June 2017,"I really love this movie! First I didn't hope too much on this movie since I got really disappointed on Annabelle (2014), but this movie turned out so good, above my expectation. This movie is about a woman (Greta) who force herself to take a job as a nanny in a remote area because she really needs the money. It turns out the boy who she needs to handle is a creepy boy doll. The boy's parents act and treat him like he is a real human boy. It made Greta confuse at the beginning but the couple succeed convincing Greta to work with them, and with all those strange rules. Then, the parents go to vacation, leaving Greta alone in the mansion with that creepy doll, and strange things start to happens. Greta is not allowed to leave the mansion, she try not to scared and bored. Her only humans to speak are her sister on the phone and a handsome grocery delivery man who only comes once a week.(Spoiler alert) In the earlier scenes, Greta heard sounds from behind the ceiling and walls, she thinks it's rats because Mr. Heelshire (the boy's father) told her before his vacation that there's many pests, especially rats in the mansion area. Then, it's occur to happen that Greta's belongings are lost or change place, I thought oh, it's that possessed boy doll who moves her belongings, just like other ghost movies, but when she heard a heavy foot steps every time she thinks the doll moves, I assumed maybe there's no boring ghost at all but a real human being who did those things, and it turned out yes, there's no ghost or supernatural things at all, the boy doll is just a simple ordinary doll, with the real killer guy is hiding behind their ceiling and walls for all the time! It's so creepy, and I love this kind of creepy. This movie will give you a good mystery atmosphere, and some surprising scenes too. This movie is very similar with When a Stranger Calls (1979 and 2006), and some of Alfred Hitchcock's, and other psychological thrillers. If you like those kinds of movies, you will like The Boy too.",The Boy

251,thpapasotiriou,Contradicting feelings,8,14 June 2020,"The movie's twist at the end brings you out of the comfort zone of scary movies in the sense that after getting you in the mood for a possessed doll gives a more realistic explanation. Therefore the first reaction is to trigger multiple questions which are not answered with rationalism....However, after a second thought I admit that it was a daring attempt for something different which provides you with an unexpected closure. Most of the movie was making a very well atmosphere for a scary movie where I have to give some extrapoints to videography and cinematics which didn't exaggerate. Acting was more than average and my opinion is that it's above the average of this kind of movies that are directed in the recent years.",The Boy

Incredible location for a horror film and a very interesting concept from a trailer that gives little away.

I found it highly entertaining and quite original by far one of the greatest horror movies of the past 20 years. Delighted to see a sequel coming out for this modern classic!

This is not a mystery, so no twist was expected, just a plain, simple, emotional creepy story about a dead boy's soul that has entered a lifelike doll! But then BAM, the twist hit me and knocked me cold. You may not like it but it's there to hit you when you least expect it For the different story and the least expected twist ever this is quite good.And I must say this is creepy little film where I found myself living in the scary home with the lead character.

The movie was not awful like other early year horror movie, and makes some good and some bad choices in its direction and storytelling.On the positive side, there is a creepy enough atmosphere in the movie and it does succeed to create genuine suspense. There are no false jump scares (meaning if there is a scare, it's from something that should actually elicit fear) and the acting is pretty good.However, there are a few negative points. The first are the dream sequences; there are two of them, and at this point dream sequences are pretty much always a gimmick, and add nothing to the film. It creates a false scare, which means that we can become desensitized to real scares in the rest of the movie. The ending (although a valiant effort at a cool twist) ends up making no sense when you think back on past events, and is incoherent.All in all, it was a enjoyable and was better than I thought it would have been.

Because of course they knew about that the real guy lived in the attic because first they closed the door in the begining to see what the ""doll"" if shes good as a caretaker then they write a letter to the son, write ""from mom and daddy""!.

Now, during the last thirty minutes right about the time Greta's ex-boyfriend shows up, the pace and suspense really picks up and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I also want to add without spoiling it, that it had a great twist that I did not see coming. Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie, better than the last couple of Horror flicks I have watched.

262,kristofen,Not Your Typical Thriller,9,23 January 2016,"Let's face it, dolls and poltergeists have been overdone in the past decades. It's always the same plot. However, it has NEVER been done like this. At first, it was a bit predictable. Nanny comes in, encounters creepy family, goes with the flow, experiences some disturbing shizz, still goes with the flow because continuity. There were some jumps that were nicely executed and it certainly kept the viewer interested. But movies like this usually head in one direction... This one, on the other hand, brought in something refreshing. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. There were very subtle hints, if any. Overall, it was above average yet unnerving. It wins a few points on creativity, so it's a 7.5. Rated it 9 to balance the score and encourage new opinions.",The Boy

265,harlemblues,Pretty Solid Horror Movie,8,5 February 2019,"I enjoyed this movie a lot and here are my reasons:
1) It leads you to believe there is some sort of mystical presence, a spirit or ghost, but it all turns out very much ""real"", which is my kind of horror movies since I don't believe in the supernatural
2) The plot is solid and the female protagonist gets her revenge against abusive and violent men
3) Usually, when in a movie a character feels a ""presence"", they never manage to have a witness, but this time Greta finds a complice in Malcom
4) I had predicted that Malcom died because that's how usually these movies end, with a dole survivor and no ""happy ending"", but he seems pretty much surviving the attack
5) The final twist is totaly unuspected and surprising. One must not think enough to put the pieces of the puzzle together and understand what actually happened that night of the murder of the little Emily and afterward.
6) there is a twist of the twist at the very end. We are left wondering whose old hands are to put the Bhrams' pieces together recomposing the doll. I suspect it was the mother. The father was depicted as the more rational of the two, so my guess is that the wife changes her mind and resurface from the water. I might have seen a ring on the hand, not sure, so would be curious to go back to the still image and compare with mother's hand.",The Boy

The first part of the film holds up well : The presentation of the doll , the two old obsessive fetish doll (interesting in the photograph doll shots ) ... but then falls style with mediocre horror sequences ( slow -fast room , noise ,jump- scare ... ) ... Then again it builds a nice atmosphere when Greta begins to think that the doll is alive ... but in the epilogue climax it is reduced to some killing ( with too little blood !! ) and a greeting ...If they had deepened the psychological aspect of the two old morbid that they forced the beautiful and fragile girl to look after the doll would be a great tragedy !",The Boy

And no logics. This is the first time I have seen a couple of people learn about a spirit in the house and are so happy to live by it. No reaction including an initial fear. And the actual story behind it, like some others feel proud of, is not worth of it. For the hype and scariness it started with, is boring in the next half",The Boy
272,jimmehford,"Not great, but not terrible either.",4,11 May 2016,"It tried something new. The ending gave me hope for the horror genre, but I wouldn't say that it's a good movie.The movie centers around character development, atmosphere, and a plot twist to make it's film stand out. The character of Greta is shown in the film to be a scared character who is trying to escape from her problems and is dealing with her own issues in an unhealthy manner. The film acknowledges this with exposition that is never in the face of the audience. The film doesn't try to force feed the audience with information just laid out on a silver platter.She develops more and more as a character as the film goes on, and is given that ultimate test in the ending where she must choose her decision on her own and face the consequences of her actions.I wish I could say more for the other characters, as everyone just seems bland, one dimensional, and forgettable. Malcolm is the pretty faced, charming neighbor. Cole is the abusive boyfriend. The couple is just strict and played off as weird. Greta is the only character that actually was well developed.The cinematography and lighting is beautiful. The set is well made and it really gives the movie a dark and creepy atmosphere. Which is a shame as the scares in the movie are predictable and minimal. The movie serves more as a drama or thriller for how the scares can be.The ending, without spoiling, threw me off and I had my jaw dropped in the theater. I did not expect this kind of twist and had a blast at the last few minutes of the movie.However, because of plot twists, it forces the audience to reflect on the entire film and see things through a different light since the movie shows you the truth. And frankly, nothing ends up making sense. A lot of situations feel as though they could have been avoided. Certain creepy elements ended up making no sense, such as wouldn't there have been more noise in such an empty and quiet house? This movie is not good by any means. The pros of the movie are enough for me to say that it was not ""terrible"", but it is then overwhelmed with the problems of the film.I'm giving it a four out of ten for at least trying something new. A plot twist that would make audiences have higher expectations for more horror films. Characters that don't seem so bland and one dimensional. It tried. That's the best I can give it.",The Boy
273,janerin-50685,Spoilers Ahead,3,17 July 2018,"Before I get too into the movie itself, I will say that I liked the opening credits, as they had a sort-of throwback affect to them since they were longer than credits usually are today. Is it really worth being gratful over? I dont know, maybe Im just desperate.
 Although this film has its problems, the second act did well in showing how the main character was manipulated into caring for the doll, and made for an interesting concept. However, the pay off is cut short once the audience is subjected to the neck-bearded man bursting out of the wall and his high-pitched cries of ""mommy"". On paper, the suprise ending may have done better, but after all the buildup the ending is rather disappointing. I cant bash the writers for trying something new with the haunted doll trope, but it definitly takes away from the atmosphere of the film. The ex-boyfriend subplot is only forgivable because of his controlling nature; the main character starts losing controll of her life and mental state after succumbing to the doll, and once her creepy ex shows up, she is almost unable to resist his demands for her to come back to the U.S. with him. But the moment he breaks the doll, the plot falls through and the tension is broken. Overall, the idea of a deranged child killer living in his parents basement, whille creepy in real life, doesnt work that well in The Boy. Maybe if the story had taken on a more Hardy Boys/Agatha Christie esc tone, or even as a Vincent Price esc melodrama thats not afriad to be a little campy, it may have done better, but of course its too late now.",The Boy

I'm not one for horrors, but I do like thrillers.The storylines is quite easy to follow, and keeps you intrigued as to what may happen. You do begin to see subtle signs, but as the movie progresses, my attention was kept on screen.The acting is fair, cast quite a basic list and although the storyline states rules need to be followed, it is pretty good at keeping you in suspense if ever one is broken.Worth a watch, it was a bit odd, but that made for better viewing for me.",The Boy
276,smithf2011,A raw review from a true horror fan who hate's movies with this kind of turn-out that was popular in the early 2000's,10,2 February 2016,"This movie, was amazing! The way the movie turned out ( the twist) was exactly how horror's from 2000 to maybe 2005 were like which was never my kind of taste (not going to give it away). Usually those movies really let me down, with the way those movies revealed the twist. But there was something about this one, that made me really enjoy the movie & the twist (which the way it turned out is usually not my kind of turn-around) with the way they revealed it, was vastly compelling and well done. Acting, story, cinematography, editing, sound design & the structure & use of movie running time was all well done. If you expect this to be a jump-scare horror you will be vastly disappointed. But it's amazing for what it was. It ends leaving you still with a chill though. A very rich mystery- suspense-horror with a few good jump scares, and some unpredictable moments. Keeps you on the edge of your seat from at least the first 20 minutes until the end. Right when you think the movie couldn't make your hair jump anymore, the last 25 minutes get's even more intense than expected. I am so sick of seeing viewers complaining about how we have way too much paranormal/possession movies over the last couple years; well here you go with the Boy. You get something a bit towards it...but not really. Go see it in theaters and enjoy. :) Very unexpected, original, keeps you on the edge of your seat. What more could you ask for?",The Boy
277,mrharrybond,This is really not as good as what it has been made out to be!!!!,3,21 March 2016,"I went into the movie, thinking it was going to be about a doll, something similar to Chucky or Annabelle but it's nothing like them. A lot of people are saying this is original, but it's not The Pact and Housebound are very similar to this. (Ending wise) A lot of the movie didn't make sense.. This is where a spoiler happens. She is given a doll to look after and he starts making you think it's a paranormal. Which it kinda makes you think, oh s**t there actually is a ghost in the doll.. But somethings don't really make sense. I'm now going to reveal the ending.. The boy isn't actually living in the doll but instead living in the house (so the doll actually had nothing to do with it) and he's a real life Adult. There's a scene where she wants to see the doll eat, to reach for his food. But he doesn't, she goes to the bin and the doll has moved, in that time frame no human can come out of a wall, pick up a doll and place it somewhere else, specially without making noise. The weird part is the ending, her ex boyfriend arrives the terrible one, at this point she thinks the ghost is still in the doll and this is the part of the film where you think they're going to tag team and kill the boyfriend together, she asks the doll to help her get rid of her ex boyfriend who is staying in the house and wants her to leave by tomorrow. So he does what she wishes. She asked for the help?! Anyway he paints blood on the wall saying ""Get Out"" then the scary ex boyfriend smashes the doll. Right now.. He is mad. This is where some of you may not of seen it coming, but the guy she thought was living in the doll comes out the wall.. Now obviously I would be scared as f**k. But one she asked for his help to get rid of him, two. Surely she should of been happy he get rid of her terrible ex boyfriend for her, He didn't want to kill any of them. He wanted to kill the ex for smashing the doll. I'm not saying they wouldn't be in shock and I just feel they should of explained more to him, what's happened. He was in a fire, his body was never found so what does that mean? There's a possibility he isn't dead. Certain things just don't link, like his parents killing themselves and so they give the nanny to him. But didn't his parents know before they went off to kill themselves, that she was meant to of been there for only a few months, so if none of that happened. When her months were up, did they just assumed she would stay.. If they really cared about there 'Boy' so much, why didn't they stay for a few nights before they went off and made sure she knew what she was doing.. I know I know it's just a movie. But sometimes these movie writers don't ever think? Oh that won't be ridiculous. It would of been more fun if the Doll was actually paranormal and the Nanny and Doll teamed up to try and kill the boyfriend. If you watched it.. The scenes before that were so strange. They build a relationship, but I don't understand, he nicked her clothes and necklace and he does something to prove he's 'paranormal' and she's best friends with him. Find out where that dress is.. Find out where your necklace is, like she is freaked out at first that he's paranormal then he gives her shoes back and she's happy with him and hugging him all around the house. If I knew a ghost was living in a doll, I wouldn't be okay with it. I wouldn't think it was a miracle. I would think this has never happened before and still be s**t scared and report it and get help. Don't waste your money to see this in cinema. This will be on Netflix soon.",The Boy
278,bryanprzy,Who Doesn't Like a Good Creepy Doll Flick?,5,10 February 2016,"Cohen stars as Greta, an American nanny hired by a wealthy English couple to watch their young boy Brahms while they are away on vacation. Things immediately take a turn when Greta arrives at the enormous, rural estate occupied only by an elderly couple and a super creepy porcelain doll they treat as if it were their son.Staying true to horror movie clichés, Brahms is dressed to the nines, has a wry smile and has a habit of wandering off when no one is looking. The elderly couple insist their son is alive and well as they hurry out the door and leave Greta alone in the house with strict rules not to leave Brahms alone and to always kiss him goodnight.The Walking Dead star Cohen carries the film, as she is the only character on screen for most of it. Despite her natural English accent and familiar Southern accent from Dead, she opts for a more Midwestern inflection. Cohen's Greta is the only American character in the film alongside Rupert Evans' Malcolm and the (mostly) silent Brahms. Bell has made a career out of directing horror. His flair for creating unsettling tension before action sequences have been apparent in his past films Stay Alive and The Devil Inside. Similarly, The Boy builds gradually throughout before the final reveal of what or who Brahms really is. If you've ever looked into a doll's gleaming porcelain eye and felt disquieted, then there is at least a few scares in this one for you.",The Boy

It's actually such an entertaining film and great for anyone who enjoys horror, and it's slightly alternative horror style is so good to watch. If you have seen the movie 'Don't Breathe' (the one about be blind veteran being robbed) then you will love this movie too. Throughout the film, you will be on the edge of your seat and it's an intense thriller/horror. Then the plot twist at the end is absolutely impeccably portrayed. I live in England myself, and so with the setting being in the English countryside, there was a sense of familiarity for me which I really liked. Great movie.",The Boy
281,imnosferatu,The Boy by I.M. Nosferatu -- A #Nosferreview,8,4 December 2019,"The Boy is noteworthy primarily because of actress Lauren Cohan. She definitely is on the rise to becoming the new Queen of Horror between this film and her portrayals of ""Maggie"" on The Walking Dead, ""Bela"" on Supernatural, and ""Rose"" on The Vampire Diaries. Yes, I can see her pushing that bloody tiara right off the head of Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis. (It'd also be great to see Curtis' entire head rolling right off her shoulders, but that's just me. That's how I roll. I know, gruesome - insert evil laugh.)The Boy is a British-Canadian film with a handful of characters. I find it rather twisted that Lauren has to use an American accent when cast in a role in her own country. Anyway, the plot is frightfully thin - an older couple, Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire, hires an American girl with a past, Greta Evans (Lauren), to be a nanny for their son, Brahms, while they go off on a long-overdue holiday. Aside from the fact that their boy is a dummy, something feels completely bizarro. And no, I'm not being politically incorrect here - the boy has ceramic head. He's better looking than Chucky and a far snappier dresser, but still resides somewhere deep in Creepsville. Indeed, Brahms seems to have a mind (and soul) of his own. Without saying a word, he ends up convincing gullible, vulnerable Greta that he is Boy9in fact alive after she's ignored both him and all the rules Mum and Pop have left for her. No more sipping wine in your nightie and talking on the phone to your bestie, Greta, you're getting paid to work! After a hairy stint in the attic, before you know it she's reading him his lessons, carrying him around like an infant, and even kissing him goodnight (I'd take one of those). Anyway, wow - who knew you could get the girl just by sitting there and looking so cute creepy and helpless - I personally have to resort to much greater lengths to get a girl, but that might entail rope or weapons or threats of fire and brimstone - but we won't go there, now will we? And then what the hell? Young stone-faced Brahms is so damn good, he goes on to convince Greta's new love interest and master grocery delivery boy, Malcolm (Rupert Evans), that he's a real boy, too. What are you? Stupid?Overall, the premise is SICK but the Mr. Hyde part of me says it could have been a really HORRIFIC movie if it hadn't jumped the shark midway through - but I'm not going to tell you how (the voices in my head say NO SPOILERS, damn them). Up until then it was creepy, unsettling, and rather thoughtful. I mean, it was almost as if Greta was becoming some sort of Stepford nanny. She'd spend all day reading to this Chucky clone and we had no idea why; was she spiraling into madness? Just my kind of girl! But after the plot twist? It was just meh. Predictable. A dime a dozen. And definitely not enough RED. What I need is a real SHARK ATTACK to get my world rocking.Then again my Dr. Jekyll side can appreciate a good peripeteia. After the movie shifts directions, the pace really moves and the characters get that blood coursing through their veins (still not the spewing and spouting RED I'd have wanted, but a guy can dream). The storyline transition took us from psychological thrills to horror chills, in a Jason-esque sort of way. Anyway, when my shrink was alive he'd tell me to just accept the things we can't change, so I guess this would be a good time to try. Too bad I can't ask him. Poor guy.As for the cast, Lauren was RIPPER SMOOTH as always in the role of the strong heroine - I'm a fan. Rupert Evans was pretty solid playing second banana to Lauren. Jim Norton as Mr. Heelshire and Diana Castle as Mrs. Heelshire are perfectly peculiar and entirely screwed up; and Ben Robson as Greta's ex, Cole, makes a great punk ass loser and abuser. But the real star? The ceramic kid - that is up until the final denouement when we learn the mystery to the dummy's existence. Then his acting falls to pieces.Depending upon where you look, The Boy is a film touted as ""mystery/thriller,"" ""psychological horror,"" and ""horror/mystery/thriller"" - it's obvious everyone can't seem to reach a collective decision. I guess I should have had lower expectations since the gods of Movieland didn't just give it the KRUGERIAN horror stamp of approval. So did I like it? Such is the dissociative personality that I am, I can't make up my mind just as the flick couldn't. My bad. You'll have to see it for yourself.",The Boy

Entertaining, smart, with pretty unexpected plot twists and characters created and performed in perfect accordance with the plot. Besides that, Lauren Cohan not only gives a great performance, but also looks prettiest and sexiest as ever.
I really don´t understand why the movie got only a 6. Probably people just didn´t like it because they didn´t see it coming; and humans, vain and petty as we are, hold grudges on everything that makes feel stupid.

It features a beautiful summer mansion, which is the highlight of this film's photographic appeal. Scare scenes are filmed without any modern special effects, but the movie; however, does display an atmosphere of reality and is quite convincing. The strength of the plot is grounded in stimulating an ""itching"" curiosity in the audience, which is magnificently expanded upon throughout the entire movie right up until the last scene. The bottom line is... if you have decided to give this movie a chance, then be prepared to watch it until it is completely over or your curiosity will likely morph into a hellish nagging question that is hooked onto the far recesses of your conscience and will likely drive you mad. In short, The Boy offers nothing special and is similar to several other old time horror flicks following a style reminiscent of that great story teller, Alfred Hitchcock.",The Boy

I didn't like the girl very much, I couldn't feel anything during the movie, get into the story, feel compassion with a character; nothing, it was like... emotionless. What feels strange is that I usually love this kind of things. Old castles, old and mysterious people not giving all the informations, old furniture and creepy dolls. It's usually one of my favorite things. I don't understand what happened with this one. I thought it was tasteless. Plus, the story-line appeared completely absurd and illogical to me.

Having just watched it, several things are running through my mind, but there a few thoughts that are a bit louder than the rest.Like WHOA. And DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. And THE HECK DID I JUST WATCH? But in a good way, you know? As you all know, Hazel is one brave puppy, but as there were several jump scares, she again left me to review the Boy alone. And as always, a movie that can scare our little dog earns four stars from her. But what about my score?First off: The good.If I had to sum up this movie is one little (OK, maybe not so little) word, it would have to be: Disconcerting. The taxidermy animals looming down at you is disconcerting. The dead creepy rats in the traps are creepy. The old creepy house is disconcerting. The old couple that live in the creepy house is disconcerting. And that creepy doll, with those creepy eyes, that creepily stare at you all the time throughout this creepy movie, is DISCONCERTING. The deliberate (but not obviously so) performance by the entire cast, the atmosphere, and the setting all bring you where you need to go. This movie does far more than guide your emotions – it outright toys with them, but that is to its betterment. For that, I have to give The Boy props. Many movies try this technique (especially horror movies) and do not pull it off, while this film does it effortlessly. All of it brings you to a very heated end, but never in a way that you expect.I don't mean the tropes because they are all conspicuously there. The dream sequence, the obligatory making out session that follows the obligatory shower scene, and the tense walk through the dark house, while it's storming outside, wrapped in a towel, holding a candle, in a big house in the middle of nowhere, with shoddy cell phone service. No, the tropes do not attempt to break any new ground. Instead, this movie uses them to its advantage, and the EVENTS that happen in this film can be described in any way but predictable.So my last point is more of a mixed bag. I would have liked to see less cheap jump scares and overused clichés, but as many twists and turns brought the movie to a very startling ending, I must say my cons for this movie are minor. Some viewers may find that there is too much build up for too little action, but the gorgeous cinematography and disconcerting atmosphere prove to be very entertaining in their own rights. For me, at least.All in all, this is definitely one to see. But the reveal, while very unexpected, lacks any defining moment of truth that some horror films make excellent use of. My original score for this horror flick was 3.5, but after comparing my score with Hazel, the adjusted score for the Boy is a solid 3.7.",The Boy

290,jeene23,A job well done until end,7,6 February 2016,"The Boy is about an American nanny who takes a unique position with an old-money family in the British countryside to look after the couple's son while they are on a long awaited holiday. Upon meeting the child, Greta (Lauren Cohan) is perplexed as to why mom and dad are treating a porcelain doll as if he was their son. According to the parents, the doll IS their son and Greta must follow a strict set of instructions in order to satisfy the needs of Brahms (the boy). Worried she will be alone in this mansion with only the doll for company, Greta meets the attractive local grocery delivery man Malcolm (Rupert Evans) who informs Greta of the history of Brahms and his parents. Thinking that Brahms is merely a doll with obsessed parents, it isn't long before Greta begins to feel that something is quite wrong after hearing voices and the doll mysteriously moving from place to place. Join Greta and Malcolm as they come too close to a long-kept secret with a devastating history.Despite being a January horror movie, The Boy had my attention and respect for a job well done until the end. Often horror movies may not provide us with the ending that we anticipated or were prepared for, but this film really took a turn for the worse when it played out in the manner in which it did. What I find remarkable about this modern old-school tale is the instant feeling of dread or fear of the unknown from the very beginning. From the dialog to the characters, each element of the story helps to continue to reinforce the ominous presence that Greta feels in the house. Unfortunately, there are just way too many unexplained, underdeveloped, and unanswered questions by the end of the movie to give the film the credit that it would have received otherwise. It is possible that the studio is setting up the audience for a prequel or a sequel, but usually these January movies do not see future installments.",The Boy

The English countryside always seems to make a haunting more realistic. Love it! Great picking with the two lead actor and actress. These days, casting has been horrible. It's rare to find a great horror movie with great casting.Hope that there will be a prequel or sequel. Either or, as long as the same leads are casted with the same actor and actress portray Malcom and Greta, respectively.Perhaps the sequel, would explain Brahms psychotic behavior. That would be interesting and how he had it in him, at the age of eight, to murder another child.",The Boy
292,nevaless,Obvious (spoilers),5,29 May 2016,"Well shot and scored however doesn't really deliver.Unfortunately the majority of the scares that this movie generates are within dream sequences. This is usually the tell of a movie that, within the conscious world of the movie itself, will bring minimal surprises. I had the story picked within 18 minutes which is where ALL of the key explanations are revealed.instructions that food was not to be wasted (he would have been eating them after they were disposed of in the trash bags), music was to be played loud (so he could hear it through the walls) as well as books being read loudly. That, along with the parents having a son that 'died' at the age of 8 and that he liked to play games.I spent the remainder of the movie waiting on the reveal which was done quite poorly.Unfortunately very obvious.",The Boy

I felt inclined after browsing through other's reviews saying how horrible this movie was. It was actually a lot better than I expected. I wasn't in a huge hurry to see it, but I'm happy I watched it. I haven't been a fan of many newer horror movies with the exception of It Follows, but I recommend watching this with an open mind. There's a twist that makes it worth while and I must admit, I didn't see it coming a mile away.

I'm enjoying the movie! All the creepy moment make my body shaking all times.Good jobs,Brahms!

My initial thoughts were that this movie would be yet another rip-off of the ""killer doll"" archetype popularized by ""Child's Play"" and it's sequels. Knowing a few names such as ""Lauren Cohan"" and ""Bear McCreary"" from the Walking Dead, my hopes were raised, yet realizing that Lauren Cohan, an English actress was playing an American immigrant visiting England, was a bit odd. My hopes were overall fulfilled as what began as a horror movie about a doll became a thriller about a burn-victim- turned-murderer. The movie takes an unexpected twist when Brahms, the main antagonist is revealed to be a loving person after all. A quite odd movie had a quite odd finish, but it overall delivered and I feel as though I got my money's worth.",The Boy

We've scrolled over 'The Boy' a few times, and thought nothing of it. We were starting to run out of horror movies to watch on NETFLIX so we decided to give 'The Boy' a shot. It did not disappoint. The movie has a nice build-up, and decent character development which is not typical of the horror genre. There are scene's that genuinely creep me out, and this doll is definitely scarier than Chucky.The reason I would not score this higher than a 6 is because I was still able to walk around in my dark house after the movie.

You assume once you've watched one you have seen them all.I went into this blind, thinking it as going to be some kind of Chucky mixed with Annabelle. Boy was a surprised at that twist!! I was very impressed with the casting, acting, plot/story.This movie delivers something different and all I can say is, watch it for the twist.The reason it is not a full 10 for me is that I wish some of loose ends had been tied up through out the film and at the end, but that didn't really deter from me enjoying the movie itself it just would have been nice if the writing had included those small plot holes.

I just love horror movies, I guess I am too desensitized from all the earlier horror movies of the past such as The Exorcist, The Shinning, The Ring and The Changeling. I don't think people from Hollywood can remember how to make a good scary film these days. The only good horror movies worth watch that are newer are Insidious, Sinister, and the Ring.

I liked the beginning with the parents, who were enjoyable to watch, very good actors. However, the execution of the story line, which starts off with potential, became dull, never quite bringing enough fear to make it worthwhile for me. The acting is not the issue, more the fact that you just don't SEE enough happening.. The location was good, nice big English home, middle of nowhere (of course). There is a twist near the end which I didn't see coming, but overall, I was bored and glad when it finished. I cannot see why it is generating so much interest and good ratings to be honest...",The Boy
307,elise-75075,"Unique, Astonishing and Truly Terrifying",8,9 April 2016,"I would give the film 'The Boy' 8 stars, the story of the film was well presented and a sort of psychological horror that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Although when you watch the trailer of the boy you get a completely different image of what the film is actually about, watching the trailer at first I thought that it was just about a possessed doll but the complete twist in the film is somewhat genius. This film has been presented as if it is a typical horror where the doll is possessed the characters solve the horror within the doll and they all live happily ever after stereotype but that is the complete opposite of this film. The surprising twist at the end is simply shocking and will really get you asking yourself rhetorical questions because what has happened is just so unexpected it is hard to know what to contemplate with this film. First impressions of this film most of the audience that I have spoken to have thought this film is similar to the horror 'Annabelle' which is about a creepy possessed doll; this is a complete contrast to the boy. The characters in this film are just so enticing and so diverse; all of the actors involved play their parts well and really bring the story alive.Around the middle of this film I found that it got a bit uninteresting, it was rather repetitive and when you are expecting something to happen it just doesn't. At this point I feel that there could have been more going on or it could have been a bit faster paced, I feel like that would have leaded me to give a higher rating of The Boy. As the film goes on you will find yourself with constant questions and confusion, some parts were slightly emotional but that soon changed when the next horrific scene came along making you sink in your seat.Overall I loved this film; the psychological effect of it really kept me going all the way to the end and left me wanting more. It was creepy, unique and the majority of the time I was watching it I felt as though I needed a pillow to hide behind. My heart was racing throughout waiting for the next action that would make my heart stop. It was truly fantastic and I look forward to watching it again and again because each time I watch The Boy it will never not be shocking to me.

The trailer definitely had me excited because it didn't seem like it was going to be a typical horror movie. It definitely was not typical. It was pretty good overall. The acting was really good. Usually in horror movies the acting is either way over the top, or just so annoying you start hating the characters halfway through. It had a few little scares here and there. They were usually subtle and left me wondering what is going on, which is what the movie was going for. I doubt here would be a sequel, which is probably a good thing. Too many horror movies go on way too long with unnecessary sequels. I can't say I plan to watch it again, but it was worth seeing.",The Boy

It is not an innovative movie, uses the same things already used in many other movies, which is not necessarily bad but the big problem with this movie is that what should make it scary is bad used and cheapened, disappointing the audience.There are somethings that don't make much sense, other things could be less explained, this is an scary movie if you explain too much you just turn off the magic, the audience is not dumb, the movie should not explain some things.

She acts convincingly here, and does well to bury her Maggie character enough for us to believe she is the girl in this film.This review contains spoilers, so please don't read on if you haven't seen the film.The film starts with Greta, a young woman starting a new job at a mansion house as a nanny for Brahms, an 8-year-old-boy. The child's parents are elderly which is a surprise. But the even bigger shock comes when the parents reveal the boy to be a life size doll. At first Greta thinks it's a joke, and treats it so until the parents leave the mansion house to 'go on holiday'. This is when things get weird. Greta starts believing the boy to be really alive. Or if not, that the doll is possessed with a spirit. Good, or evil???Here's the spoiler...Malcolm, the local guy who delivers the weekly shopping, SHOULD HAVE BEEN the real Brahms, and 'in with it' sort of speak. But he isn't. The reason why I say this is I found Malcolm incredibly creepy and his chat up lines to Greta, embarrassing. The fact he is the innocent party in this is such a wasted opportunity to make him guilty of something...as I said to be Brahms. I won't reveal the ending, but suffice to say I can understand why people are annoyed by it.I give it a solid 7/10. My only gripe, there wasn't more characters in it.",The Boy

The atmosphere is built up with a classic remote castle and a creepy family. Then you're made to believe there is a ghost in the house, and the movie would have been so much better if that had been the case, but in the end it's just some stupid parody of a Jason or Michael Meyers guy running around in a mask. The entire movie does not answer any of the questions that are built up and the writer seems confused about how to write an ending to a good horror movie, so they ended up with a disappointing murderer in the walls.

The other reviews have summed it up well - a girl alone in a huge house in the middle of nowhere ""looking after"" a doll - but the story does a lot to actually make you feel for the doll and shortly after the girl's ex arrives there are so many directions that the story can go in.Definitely a must-see and would highly recommend avoiding any spoilers before watching. **SPOILERS**It seems most people's issue with the film is the actual ending that was chosen, which to me was more refreshing and creepy than having a supernatural cause (would have been better, IMO, if Sinister had taken such an approach). Sure, it's not that realistic, unless you imagine that living in the walls was only when visitors were around and possibly the parent's doll-treatment as well, but in any case Brahms is described as ""odd"" by his father. One of the things that I found more problematic was that his face was actually badly scarred - you see this around 1.5 hours in, when part of his mask cracks after the ""good night"" scene. I had assumed that the parents faked the fire that Brahms ""died"" in, but suppose he could have started the fire himself and somehow burned his face in doing so...",The Boy

It's a forgone conclusion that the evil entity is going to win, and I am stuck as a witness to an hour and a half, or more, of people being stalked and tortured.So, why am I reviewing a horror film? Lauren Cohan.I'm a Walking Dead fan. Lauren Cohan portrays one of my favorite characters on the Walking Dead. The Walking Dead is on hiatus right now, and I think that Cohan is a pretty good actress, so . . .Since 'The Boy' is set in the United Kingdom I was expecting 'Child's Play' with actors with English accents. And for first half of the movie I get exactly what I expected: people abruptly appearing to give Greta (Lauren Cohan's character) and the audience a fright; the titled ""Boy"" seeming to move of its own volition.About the time that my mind is beginning to think of other things I could be doing other than watching the last half of 'The Boy' the movie takes a twist.The twist is one that I hadn't foreseen, but which given the back story of the characters in the film makes perfect sense. So I was intrigued enough to keep watching. And what followed was a very interesting plot twist, followed by, hands down, the creepiest, and most shocking movie ending that I have seen since the 'Silence of the Lambs.'As I began with, I am jaded when it comes to horror films, and 'The Boy' was kind of slow in the beginning, but it is a smartly written and directed movie that has some great twists and turns.",The Boy

322,thunderbird70,I wanted more from this film.,5,10 February 2016,"This is a film that promised so much and just couldn't deliver throughout the 97 minute film. While promising a somewhat predictable but always scary story line of a demonic living doll, ""The Boy"" just seems to leave you craving more. Lauren Cohan does a rather good job of portraying the character ""Greta Evans"" even though Greta's character is slightly underdeveloped, which is a surprise if you follow Lauren's ability to build her character on ""The Walking Dead"". You are never quite sure of Greta's full background as a character other than she is running from some unknown catastrophic event in her characters past, until close to the end of the film.The supporting cast does a mediocre job at supporting this small cast, while the story line slows to an uncontrollable bore fest during the middle of the film. The shining glory of ""The Boy"" is the fresh twist towards the end of the film, will leave that for you to find out.

323,YahiaShowgan,this movie is awful,1,30 April 2016,"this movie sucks so bad. don't watch it. leaves many unanswered questions, no ending at all and nothing makes sense! at the end we understand that Braham was living inside the walls the whole time, he was the one moving the doll every time it was unwatched and he had everything he needed inside.. he used the crawl spaces and other hidden places to get around and his parents kept him hidden for about years since he was wanted for questioning about the little girl Brahama killed. it looks like his parents were scared of him and kept feeding him and protecting him and in the end they couldn't take anymore and drowned themselves. the movie gives no explanation what so ever about why he killed the little girl when he was a child, why his parents kept hiding him, what was the doll all about and why it was needed, how did the house shake when the doll was broken and the lights went crazy, and how Braham was never seen every time the doll was moved and he did stuff inside the house",The Boy
324,intenselan-145-930862,They missed an opportunity to make this extraordinary!,7,4 June 2021,"****CAUTION: THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS****There was a point in the movie, at the Big Reveal, that this movie could have become something unique and masterful. They had great actors, a promising premise, and an actually believable story arc. But the screenwriter and director decided to make it a pedantic horror movie rather than explore Brahms' psyche or Greta's choices.I also like that they didn't make the doll demonic in and of itself. That trope has been done to death with Child's Play, Annabelle, and Monkey Shines. Instead, the mind of Brahms plus his parents and his backstory was very interesting or compelling.Gretas choice in calling out to Brahms for help, and then attacking him for doing just that made me upset. I was actually sympathetic for Brahms and believed that he was a victim of his parents abuse and pressure.I would have loved to have seen this as a redemption story for both Greta, whose own backstory left a hole in her heart that Brahms could ultimately fill, and for Brahms, who was both inwardly tortured and imprisoned by his parents who only loved him through his avatar- the doll.There was a movie back in the 80s called The Boy Who Could Fly whose relationship between the institutionalized boy and his caretaker/companion were similar to each other, and even when that Boy revealed his powers to her, she wanted to know him more. I would have loved to have seen that here instead of what happened.The true failure in this movie was her abusive ex that she spent the entire movie running and hiding from only to attempt to kill Brahms for attacking him in her defense when he found her and got abusive. What was the point?? That didn't fit at all in the movie!I haven't seen the sequel to this, but I understood that they rewrote him and the protagonists and everything from the ground up. What a complete waste of what could have been an incredible human condition story.If this was the fault of the studio stepping in and interfering, shame on them. If this is the screenwriter losing his nerve when it came time to explore the inner workings of the characters, then I lament for what this movie could have been. The Boy Who Could Fly touched more on depth but its ultimate shortcoming was that it was a Disney movie catered to per-teenagers and had to be tempered. This movie could have truly been great!Hopefully they'll make a new movie in afraid to explore a relationship like this!",The Boy

The acting was great....up until Cole's entrance. Then it became laughable. I thought he was English with an Irish lilt for the first few lines, then he tried some kind of broad northern American accent, and finally was so inconsistant that any of the tension created up until that point was lost and I was thrown out of the story and into wondering why in anyone's mind was this bloke a decent person to cast.

329,Lucifers-Left-Lung,The Boy is Very Anti-Climactic and Quite Disappointing,4,25 November 2016,"Can you say anticlimactic? I can.I won't lie, going into this movie, I didn't have high hopes. When I first saw the preview for it a few months ago, I wasn't impressed and thought it looked quite stupid. Unfortunately, I was right. But right before we started the movie, my sister told me that her friend said it was creepy, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.The beginning is slow and it annoyed me to the point that I considered shutting it off. But it eventually picked up. Sort of.There were a few 'jump scares'. One of them actually got me even though I knew it was coming (I work in a video store and see the previews over and over everyday). But two of the supposed scary parts weren't even real, they were just in her dreams. That bugged me.Then there's the fact that when she started actually taking care of the doll like it was a real boy, I was kind of confused about whether or not she was even acting. One minute, she's being all weird and junk, and the next minute she's back to herself. Was she acting? Or was it real? I guess I'll never know.And this is just freaking DUMB: the two old parents go out to the beach or whatever and pick up these (strangely) identical rocks – just one – put the thing in their pocket and walk out into the water. And magically sink. Because of one rock. They sink. One rock. One. Rock. Made them sink. One.Towards the end, when Captain Dingleberg smashes the doll, I actually regained my hope. Because there's suddenly something climbing out of the wall. Is it a demon? A monster? A spirit???? No, it's a — person. Wow. Gee whiz, guys. Way to go. Bravo, a freaking person. Hallelujah. For a second I thought it was actually going to be something interesting.Turns out, this boy had been hiding in the walls. Had a kitchen and a bed and everything. His house was bigger than mine and it was a freaking wall. Among his fanciness, he had a doll he'd made of Maggie – I mean, Greta – with her clothes and everything.And then – typical horror-murder-movie-style – he chased them and tried to kill them. Well, he actually wanted Maggie – Greta – to be hiswhat? I don't even know. Just to be his, I guess.

Even though I never heard of anyone who acted in this film, I think they did an amazing job delivering, and making the movie more intense and entertaining.

332,steven_padley,Surprisingly original,9,3 February 2016,"It's hard to take a movie about a ""haunted"" doll seriously after so many Child's Plays, and so many ripoffs (Annabelle was awful) This was my main apprehension about seeing The Boy, which I'll admit peaked my interest when it likely shouldn't have. I fell for the same trap recently with The Forrest and can't put into words how disappointing an experience that was. The Boy starts off slow, allowing you to take in just how odd the situation our protagonist finds herself in is. Once things do start to happen that are out of the ordinary they've very subtle, and I found the pacing kept me interested and anticipating what would happen next. One of the best aspects about the film is the eventual twist, which at no point did I even consider, and was pleasantly surprised by.As a fan of original concepts I can safely recommend The Boy, which puts a refreshing twist on a very dated concept.",The Boy
333,kareemhonish-46878,Discount Mila Kunis with Discount Brad Pitt with a fresh doll,3,2 April 2016,"First of all. This movie makes no sense. It starts out with fresh family with their fresh doll. At the beginning it's a melt spirit or something but then it turns out to be a fresh sorry hard with a fresh beard who's ripped despite eating nothing but scraps and never working out because he lives in a FRESH wall. Oh no i spoilt the movie but seriously who cares it is terrible. You know who this movie is for? You know your mum's fat friend.You know that friend has a fresh life doing nothing but looking after her kids and cheating on her husband. THAT woman. Yes her. They get scared at jump-scares and think they know what real horror is. If this film was printed on 70mm film i would get that film and wipe my a** with it. If you want to be a real human being go and watch Zootropolis or batman vs superman and stop cheating on your husband. Right ill go back to my review. The main girl in it is a bit dumb and fit like every single girl in a horror film. Her acting is so bad that when she enters the big mansion she says ""wow"" like 5 times. Honestly my cat is dead and is more alive than her. In conclusion ""The boy"" Should have never been created and they should have spent the money on advertising for Batman v Superman and Zootropolis. Listen for some people they make £6.50 an hour (Minimum wage)> A ticket is £7.50. Meaning for some of you, you'd HAVE to work MORE than an hour to pay for the ticket. Also since your a fat woman who cheats on her husband you're gonna want popcorn and drinks which is like £7. Meaning you'd have to work MORE than two hours to actually pay for this. I mean like 2hrs and 30 minutes. Which is as long as Batman V Superman. So basically if you see this movie you should die and don't worry i am already dead inside so it doesn't matter to me",The Boy
334,peterich-69001,Genre blending horror,9,11 August 2018,"I felt compelled to write my first review on here after seeing this film. There are some few low scores here that complain about how the story goes where you don't expect it to. Well, if it did, then surely it would just blend into every other ""doll"" film like Annabelle or Child's Play.
I personally loved it. The acting was believable. It wasn't over cooked or hammy. The characters took one another seriously rather than choosing not to believe what was going on. There were some decent back story elements.
What I also enjoyed was how creepy this film was. I had a few moments where the hairs stood up on my arms and neck. 
The twist...well I won't drop any spoilers but I believe this to be one of the very few horrors that has blended two horror sub-genres together and I found it really effective.
Turns the lights off, and enjoy!!",The Boy
335,cliveminecraft,There is a twist and then there is this.,6,16 February 2017,"The boy is a horror film that, once again, orbits around a doll that seems to be possessed. This type of tale has been played out in recent years but still manages to entertain a lot of horror fans out there.The boy goes in a slightly new direction with the ""doll genre."" Which is a welcome sight I'm sure. The boy focuses on a rich family in the UK that tragically lost their son in a fire 20 years before the film is set. On the same day as the tragedy a doll had appeared and the family believed it was their lost son. Our main character has taken on the task of watching the boy whilst the parents go on holiday. Interesting enough plot slightly different to the usual. The acting is good and contains a decent amount of character development, which is something you don't always see in horror movies. You don't have to wait to long before things start going bump in the night which, again, I feel is a welcome sight. The middle of the film is entertaining and contains some jump scares but the film mostly relies on the tense atmosphere and the viewers apprehension. The finale...leaves a lot to be desired I'm afraid to say. It appears that writers seem to have an obsession with twists, which isn't always a bad thing. However this writer decided to go a bit to far and seemingly sprints off in a different direction leaving the viewer disappointed and wondering what the hell just happened. To be honest I'm still trying to wrap my head around it as I'm writing this. We find out that the doll is not actually haunted but is being moved around by the real and very much alive son who has been living in the walls. Now we are shown that the walls are hollow and he has access to the entirety of the mansion. But, for me at least, it still leaves a lot of questions for example: How fast is he? There are several scenes where the doll moves in a matter of seconds yet we are given no sign of how a man could do that. Whats worse is that the notion of this ending wasn't even hinted at not in the slightest. It always disappoints me when an ending screws up the film when the writer/s decide to ""keep us on our toes."" In a ridiculous way that doesn't seem to match the story what-so-ever. However despite the finale I did still very much enjoy the bulk of the films content. I do still recommend watching this film if you have little else to watch or just simply bored.",The Boy

The plot started off as intriguing, babysitting a doll instead of a regular boy. The scenes was fine. The doll looked creepy. The atmosphere was ominous which i liked, the build up to the point where the dude finally broke the doll was good. The twist may have some controversy whether it's good or just plain bad. however, i can still go with the ending. Sure, you can say ""This dude, hiding for about 20 years, just wanted to secretly move a doll so that he can get some scare and attention from a woman? get real!"" Well, he is an odd ball, so yeah that explains it...not. Further explanations why he is acting like that may be needed in the movie, i think. his obsession over dolls came out of nowhere.It was a decent movie. worth watching for fun. 6.3/10",The Boy

The trailer will paint a different picture than what you will imagine this movie to be; however, for some movies, that is OK - just not for this movie. This one left me feeling ripped off. I cannot tell you how many times this movie made me start laughing over the absurd and non logical transitions of the characters' behaviors and the realizations that make you think - you've got to be kidding. I suppose if there are people liking this movie, there must be people as crazy as the characters in the movie. I went to see a horror movie but instead feel like I watched a drama or thriller that contained little to no real suspense. In a way, I'm embarrassed for the cast as this was just terrible.

If you read a few of the other IMDb reviews you may be confused about whether this film is a quality production, let alone if it is a ""good"" horror movie. I have some answers for you.Yes, there is no arguing against the quality in this horror movie. The production values are good, the actors are fine. The plot is superficially routine - is the doll alive?, and may turn off potential viewers before it is watched because the trailer and promos look so much like another 'evil doll' scary movie. It is actually very original and it may be extremely scary, depending on your own life experiences. If you have never had any real life scares from real people, and if you need heavy duty blood and guts to be satisfied with a horror movie you likely will be one of those who finds this movie slow and uninspired.

It draws you in and makes you feel like you are in the house with them. It may even cause you to doubt your own sanity at times. If you like a good, scary movie that plays like a Twilight Zone episode, this is the one for you.From the moment Greta arrives at the eerie mansion in the very beginning you'll find yourself trying to figure out why her new employers are so mysterious.

I was held interested until the very end and I can honestly say no modern horror movie has done that. I wasn't ""terrified"" or anything of that degree, but I was drawn into it with suspense and curiosity on how the story would unfold.
 It was set in a nice creepy environment and the cast makes you invested in their characters and you do have a certain sense of care for them. The ending wasn't quite what I was expecting but it was decent.... meaning nothing over the top or outlandish but I wished it ended differently. The ending wasn't bad to say the least, just not the way I would have ended it.

Still, a respectable opening-weekend gross is possible, given the current lack of similar product in the megapixel marketplace. Lauren Cohan of TV's ""The Walking Dead"" stars as Greta, an American who opts to get far away from an abusive boyfriend by traveling all the way to a distant corner of the British countryside. She winds up at a Gothic manor home near an isolated village, to interview for what she thinks will be the job of caring for an 8-year-old boy. How is this even in horror.

353,BradBeanHarper,"★★☆☆☆ - ""Second-hand genre banality.""",3,23 March 2016,"Greta is a young, American nanny, who has been employed by an elderly couple, Mr. & Mrs. Heelshire, to take care of their child, while they are on holiday, at their isolated English mansion; but the premise of William Brent Bell's (The Devil Inside, Stay Alive) new horror film, The Boy, is not entirely that straightforward. As the title rather conveniently suggests, Bell's fifth film centres around a boy, who goes by the name of Brahms. However, the Heelshire's failed to mention some vital information to Greta regarding Brahms before she eagerly signed up to work for them: he is a doll.""Hello, is anybody up there?"": One of Greta's opening lines, which ticks a box on any 'horror clichés list', The Boy unquestionably delivers a concoction of cheesiness. Almost immediately, after Greta leaves the taxi driven by a perverted cab driver who has a thing for her cleavage, we are launched into this crater of predictability and genre convention: A Gothic mansion ""in the middle of nowhere"", many shots of creepy toys, the dull woman in danger vs. otherness staying away from the border into perilous, ground-breaking territory; instead, sticking to the basics.After some exploring around the eerie house, Greta is introduced to the Heelshire's suave grocer, Malcolm, who can supposedly read peoples pasts by holding their chewing gum—grim. After reading Greta's gum, Malcolm predicts that she has had a troubled life. It is later revealed that Greta is escaping a violent relationship she had in the U.S., with a douche—or man—named Cole. Sensing some chemistry between both Malcolm and Greta, it is evident this shall not be the last time we see Malcolm nor hear his poncey English accent; the plot is all too familiar. Shortly after this encounter, we have the pleasure of meeting the Heelshire's. Both with voices which are the epitome of Downtown Abbey English (of course), Mrs. Heelshire is a blank but peculiar lady who—along with Mr. Heelshire—we only see for a short while. During this time, Mrs. Heelshire introduces Greta to their son, Brahms, who she discovers to be a bisque doll. The Heelshire's take care of Brahms as if he were a real young boy, using it as a decoy to sugar-coat the fact that the real Brahms was killed in a fire over 20 years ago. Greta handles the situation collectively, only letting a single giggle slip-out, presenting little resistance to the story of Brahms, which is both frustrating and questionable. Mrs. Heelshire goes through all the rules Greta needs to abide by while they are away on holiday, such as kissing Brahms goodnight and serving him food. It is not long before the Heelshire's leave Greta with Brahms, alone in the house (well it had to be done, didn't it?), naïve and defenceless (that too).By this point, the overarching thrill of this film has ferociously disintegrated into the ground: Jump scares have already made an appearance ten minutes after the film started, too early to construct any form of suspense. Also, we have already been introduced fully to the main spectacle of the show, Brahms, leaving us nothing but Greta's struggle to look after this child/doll and the story of why she left home to pursue her nanny career in Great Britain, which doesn't make a riveting viewing. For me, before watching a horror film, I have a buzz: A combination between excitement and fear of the unexpected, which couple together to form a hybrid emotion, otherwise known as the buzz. However, my buzz deflated a few scenes into The Boy due to its lack of suspense, leaving us nothing to anticipate, instead we watch a catalogue of second-hand genre banality.Greta originally does not treat Brahms like a human-being. After the Heelshire's leave, she begins by placing a blanket over his head, putting her feet up and nibbling on a sandwich while Brahms is collaborating an evil plan to kill Greta, or something along those lines. Strange supernaturalesque behaviour begins to kick off: The blanket on Brahms somehow has fallen on the ground when Greta returns, her necklace and dress is stolen while she showers (typical), loud noises are coming from the attic and Brahms starts appearing in different locations around the house. Greta then starts to believe that Brahms is alive, sharing this news with Malcom who, again, is another pushover who accepts this story.Performances in this film are solid—but how challenging can it be to act surprised and out of breath like Greta? Letting the side down, however, is Cole (Mark Robson), Greta's violent American ex, who could do with a few more years in drama school—if he did at all attend—as he embarks on an un-energised, naff performance. A Golden Raspberry nomination? Perhaps. Luckily, he isn't in the film for long and this didn't damage my overall opinion of the movie: its place in cinematic hell was already sealed firmly in the ground long before.Yet another one of William Brent Bell's horror films carries a dangerously thin screenplay, oozing with predictability in a joyless fashion. However, originality is not my principle disliking for this newest contemporary-genre trash; Bell does not understand the concept of suspense at all, which should be the load-bearing wall in this type of film, leaving the audience with an empty, jump-scare fest which focuses too much on Greta's past rather than building a tense atmosphere in the present. The aesthetic and style is correct, the setting is not at all uncommon but satisfactory, these are things that didn't cock-up. For Bell, horror clearly isn't his thing, perhaps an M. Night Shyamalan in the making? A good shout. I would recommend that he works on making a film in another genre, however I don't want him to obliterate yet another one. If this wasn't the tombstone of his film career, then prepare for more trash in the near but distant future I just hope this doesn't put you off horror, or the cinema, altogether.",The Boy

360,fgsarah,A decent horror movie,10,9 July 2016,"As an avid horror movie watcher and film major in college, I felt inclined to write a review over this movie. Typical horror movies have become so overrated and easy to predict that they are painful to watch. They will ether be really good and then have a sucky ending, or they will just become cheesy... This movie however doesn't fit the format for the regular horror genre. I thought at first ""this is about a doll, how can this movie not be cheesy?"", but the more I watched, the more and more I got sucked in. The movie does have somewhat of a basic story line, but you establish a connection with the main characters and it's easy to follow. It doesn't follow the format of horror movies IE: the jump scare rule of thirds, dark scenes, etc. You can actually see everything that's happening without any terrible dark scenes and poor lighting. I think ""The Boy"" is an all around good movie and a must see for horror movie fans! It has taken on a new twist and it took complete advantage of it! It had a wonderful twist mid movie and... THE END DIDN'T SUCK! The movie is creepy and has plenty of jump scares. It does its job of scaring you without a lot of special effects, blood, gore, etc. Horror movies today are such a disappoint and this one (at least for me) was not.

364,alanhanks,Poor,4,13 January 2017,This filmed had potential to be really good but the script was to conservative to test the boundaries.The look was incredible but that is not enough to make up for a poor script. It never knew what it wanted to be and that was the problem.It had a few cool scenes but ultimately leaves you wanting more.The cast were fine but I'm sure they were not satisfied with what they were given.I'm not sure why they went the direction they did for a dull overused ending but that's Hollywood these days.I'm a fan of good stories this was simply ludicrous at times borrowing from other films but with a poorer execution.,The Boy
365,getslim-23861,A good plot but could have been better,5,22 January 2016,"SPOILER ALERTIt has only one or two jump scares but manage to give a bit creepiness and keeps me guessing even though there are some parts were predictable. The house, the doll,bcreate a mystery to the movie.. There is some plot holes like some ofthe parents' decision has no logical explanation. The first 3 quarter of the movie is OK but the whole thing went down the hill towards the end as the twist was disappointing.. It kinda ruin the whole movie for me..... I was expecting for something else.. overall, it has a good plot but could have been executed better..",The Boy
366,ddemers-42271,Terrible waste of time,1,28 January 2016,"I do not want to spend much time giving this sad excuse for a movie a review however, I would like to encourage anyone thinking of seeing this ""horror /thriller"" to reconsider. Choose any other movie and do not waste your time or money on this atrocity. It lacks the following-originality, intensity, mystery, horror, gore etc. the ending is almost laughable...reminiscent of a CSI episode, which I am pretty sure is where the writer stole his idea for the ""twist ""at the end of the film. The only jolt I got during this entire movie happened close to the beginning and sadly failed to keep me interested throughout... continuously disappointing. It did not have a climatic point and some of the scenes were just completely stupid, lacking any logic. The acting wasn't horrible. The main problem came from a lack of excitement or intensity which made this movie a serious flop in my mind.Terrible terrible terrible, oh Maggie you Should stick to the walking dead!",The Boy
367,kellysumwailin,Makes me wanna start watching horror movies now,9,5 February 2016,"I don't get why this movie only has 6.4/10??? hands down one of the best horror/thriller movies out there. to start off, i'm not a fan of horror movies. i never watch em. i think they're such a waste of money and time.why pay money just to cover your eyes throughout the movie? oh boy, this movie totally changed my opinion on horror films. i was pretty much at the edge of my seat the entire time. so exhilarating. gotta admit, the beginning was a little slow and it's kinda predictable.but nearing the end, man it took such a turn. i love the plot twist!! this movie has quite a number of jump scares, and they do get to you, even to those 'immune' to the scares. from the reaction of the audience and myself, its safe to say no one really expected what happened nearing the end.Next, Lauren Cohan's acting is A*. she gets the emotions across and i could literally sense the fear in her eyes. basically all the actors and actresses did a great job. honestly if they acted poorly, i would give this movie a rating of 5/10 despite the fact that the ending was awesome. -1 point off because of the slow start to the show. but honestly it wasn't really that bad.'The boy' is my first horror movie after years of avoiding this genre, so you could say i am a 'newbie' to this genre and might find me easily scared of nothing, but do give this movie a shot even if you're emotionless person who isn't afraid of anything; it might just surprise you.",The Boy
368,albobayern,Great Movie 10/10,10,10 February 2016,"Very good film, recommended for anyone It keeps the suspense from beginning to end Great performance by Lauren Cohan. over all an excellent movie, with great character development, great acting, clever cinematography and stays away from the common horror cliché's, truly a film worth watching alone or with friends. the movie was so good I'll have to see it many times. The boy is not a common and current movie horror and I think many feel the same. Obviously the film is not perfect, but far superior to many others as Anabelle, for give an example. and maybe ""The Boy"" will be surpassed by other horror movies, but does not mean it will not be remembered. In conclusion, a movie too good",The Boy
369,peleska,The worst and the most boring movie ever,1,29 January 2017,"Here i am, just watching for some good movie to watch. And i run across this one in one of the topics on Facebook. God, who forced me too look this? 3AM, a lonely girl(me) and the movie that can't be less scary or more dumb. I am very disappointed. Trailer was good, the beginning was good. But the point of the story? Three year old kid wouldn't get scared! Gosh, Hollywood producers, get some imagination! A complete failure. Actors are miserable, Bram's story is incomplete,his character is so weak,Cole's character is lame, Malcolm is a pussy, and this main role, whatever her name is, has no enough emotions for this kind of situation. All in all, a complete mess. I thought that i will give it 2 votes because of the good camera angles and quality, but i changed my mind considering that it's 21st century and that quality should be conceivable. Do not waste your time!",The Boy
370,danjgrundy,Surprisingly good.,6,23 March 2016,"I went into this with no expectations of it being amazing but I'd seen the trailers and liked the idea behind it. Yes the whole ""living dolls"" thing has been done a number of times before but it still drew me in enough to want to see it.Without giving away too much of the plot it feels like a standard creepy horror outing for a while until things start to turn towards the end. Still the environment (creepy mansion, complete with tacky taxidermy dotted around) is well done giving a nice background into how the weird old couple live. Musical score was OK, though I don't remember anything jumping out at me.Overall for someone who doesn't normally go in for horror films, I'd recommend this to both fans of typical horror and those who don't usually partake.",The Boy
371,daviematin,Disappointed,4,15 April 2016,"The movie was OK, but the ending was disappointing. The movie overall was not very scary and the parts that were scary were ruined with the ending. The leading actress from the walking dead acted well but her character was the usual self obsessed type that you're supposed to feel sorry for. If you wanted a thriller fine but a Horror not really. The plot didn't make that much sense either with why the parents would do such a thing to begin with if they're only going to kill themselves anyway.Also the doll had a boys voice so Im not sure how anyone over the age of 14/15 would manage such a voice anyway (maybe a girl could). So overall I would say a poor horror but a good thriller.",The Boy
372,calinmalan,What was this ?,5,17 April 2016,"The beginning was good. It gets you in the movie's atmosphere, but overall the story is uninspired, with pretty much no suspense. The acting is not very good. And the ending is a LOAD OF NONSENSE. There was the potential for a very good ending, but they messed it up. After a guy breaks the creepy ceramic doll which the movie is centered around, an adult version of the doll is revealed and attacks the characters. This is executed awfully in every aspect. The twist isn't even funny. and The final fight isn't even of a supernatural nature. Some good parts still exist so I wouldn't discard the movie as a pile of garbage, but I would recommend it either.",The Boy
373,ilk005,A Real Horror Movie,7,30 January 2021,"You obviously scared whole movie.Atmosphere, ambiance,mystery and sudden things make you scared and wonder about the film. You think you watch some chicle and you can see what is gonna happen at the end of the movie. BUT no! not like you think or guess... Great and orginal movie.",The Boy
374,joanneadri,It was a good movie,7,6 May 2016,"I had the opportunity to watch it at cinema. Everybody scream. It had a good photography to make you believe the doll is alive. But also remembers me a lot of Deadline movie, overall its red dress, the past of the protagonist (the same story about a woman that suffered a lot abuse from his husband, she lost the baby and she try to forget her past by running away to a place that supposed to be in the middle of nothing in a house that is enough big to forget everything) But I have to say that I admire the fact that makes you believe is a cursed doll in the entire movie, but it isn't . it was a different perspective of the story of a killer",The Boy
375,maximumegg,Good potential; someone should edit it,6,11 November 2016,"I watched this with my boyfriend, and we had a few laughs and scares, but we had a great time up until the end. All the scenes before her ex came back were great. In fact, if this movie cut out any mentions of the ex beforehand and stopped right before he appeared, it would be so much better. In my opinion, a movie with a concept like this that just stops at the nanny and Brahms making peace with each other and acting as a normal family would be really funny, and would end the movie on an odd, yet feel-good note. But going in depth with all of the ""Brahms is actually a ghost girl, no wait! it's some random guy in the house!"" seemed incredibly forced and made the movie seem ridiculous (well, even more so) and really turned me off.",The Boy
376,leinpaguio,It was a movie watched for nothing!,3,30 May 2016,"I was awe at the beginning of the movie, thinking that I'd get what I watched from the trailer online. I was ecstatic to see it since I haven't got the chance to watch it on the big screen. I meant no offense but, The Boy was a downright disappointment. It included scenes that weren't even planned, or maybe were made, just for the sake of making a supposedly 'new age' horror movie. The description didn't even include the horror/SLASHER part since it was like a mixture of a horror movie and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I wasn't informed about the plot twist. Maybe I expected too much on the movie, that's why when it ended, I think it left me hanging just like the questions from Brahms past that were left hanging and needed for answers. It was a far cry from what I expected it to be. The Boy had its promising start as it gave a couple of ""hair-raising"" moments, but it ended there. After watching the ending of the movie, boy, I felt betrayed somehow. The trailer gave a 'ghostly' feels, then the movie kind of ruined the trailer for me. Ugh! It was a total wreck. Please, don't watch it.",The Boy
377,katherineljfoster,No spoilers - genuinely decent horror,9,25 January 2020,"Genuinely decent horror/scary films are hard to come by. 90% of horror films work off the premise of the unimaginable, bizarre, and unlikely. You have to forgive the implausible and just run with it. Some horror films do the implausible better than others and this in my view was one of them.The acting was decent, the location and cast kept simple, and there was only a couple of eye rolling 'as if you'd be that stupid' moments' e.g lone female wearing nothing but a towel after having a shower, goes into the attic, without putting any lights on, after hearing noises up there.... I really wish horror films would just cut that rubbish out!But on the whole, the story was immensely absorbing. Not much gore, filled with suspense, with a tonne of surprises - just the way I like my spine tinglers!If you've got a Netflix subscription and you like horrors - it's definitely one to check out!",The Boy
378,NaderaNadour,A good movie,6,4 July 2016,"At first it was so interesting in the first 30 minutes I was excited, but then it became a little boring and slow, and the ending was not as expected and turned out dull and silly. Anyway I recommend watching it especially if you like horror movies. Its a little bit different and new idea. I think this movie is similar to (housebound), they have the similar events. But housebound in my opinion is so much better if like comedy. Actors' performance was good but there were few characters which, I think, made the movie slow. It was better to concentrate on what happened in the past and how Brahms was then, and how it all started, many questions if had been answered the story could have been so much better. Pictures and effects were very good. I enjoyed this movie but didn't like the ending so much.",The Boy
379,tkinnaird-08104,Cherie and Pois' verdict: Good,9,3 August 2016,"Cherie and Pois are a young, hip couple who enjoy netflix and chilling. Unfortunately, being ""netflix and chill"" veterans, we have quickly found ourselves looking long and hard for good films to watch. We stumbled across ""The Boy"" on a whim, having fiddled with the search filters on a definitely not pirated website. The following is our verdict.It was really good. Pois can tell when a film is really good, because if it isn't, Cherie tries to have sex with him. Pois has to bat her hand away. When it doesn't work, she goes to sleep. During ""The Boy"", Cherie neither tried to grab my willy, nor slept. That really does show the quality of this film.9/10 would watch again.Yours in earnest, Pois and Cherie",The Boy
380,jemcbrierty,14 and up,7,15 October 2016,"The Boy was a pretty good movie. It was also a very very scary and interesting and a little bit weird and also very surprising toward the end of the movie. I recommend this movie for people that are about 14 and up, and I do not recommend this movie for kids under 10 11 and under. The movie also has some gore and violent content, there is not a lot of bad language in the film just a few swears nothing to bad. The end of the movie with Barnipis is very very very intense and quite frightening and very very scary to watch, if young. I would give this movie about six seven or maybe even about like eight stars. Throughout the hole entire movie it has a creepy scary and frightening feel to it. The only really bad and inappropriate part of the film was probably the violence mostly towards the end of the movie, and that is pretty much all of the violence in the movie. This movie to me was very very frightening scary and kind of violent, so this movie is recommended for mature and reasonable kids and or teen or adult. So that is what I think of the movie and the rating content and how appropriate it is for people.",The Boy
381,captainweekend,This is a great thriller,10,10 November 2018,My wife and I really loved it. The twist at the end makes me wonder if it owes it's origin to The Phantom of the Opera more than the creepy child or haunted doll genres.,The Boy

384,hairyhead,"Unique take on your typical ""scary doll"" film",7,18 May 2017,"I loved this film because it was different, innovative, and unpredictable. It was entertaining because it had you guessing throughout the entire film and had you on the edge of your seat. It was thrilling and a well made film. The educational aspect of this film was a bit dry. There wasn't a moral of the whole story. there was good literary value to this film. The external conflict was Greta taking care of the doll and trying to figure out who's causing all of the mischief. It also was Greta and Malcolm trying to find a way to help the boy's spirit come to peace. The internal conflict was within Greta and her past. Both these conflicts were developed well and were straight forward. Overall this film was a different and unique take on the thriller genre. I would definitely recommend this film to others.",The Boy

But seriously this movie is atleast worth a watch, it has some decent scares and lemme just say as someone who predicts the twists and endings for a lot of movies... I did not predict this one, I really enjoyed it and would totally recommend a rewatch because they did a lot of subtle things that hinted at the ending. There are some plot holes, but if you can look past those it is overall a great movie!",The Boy
