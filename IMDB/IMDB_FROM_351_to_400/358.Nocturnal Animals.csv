0,SnoopyStyle,"""Nocturnal Animals"" could be good",6,29 July 2017,"Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is an avant-garde art gallery owner. Her marriage to Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer) is deteriorating. She receives a manuscript entitled ""Nocturnal Animals"" from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) dedicated to her. It's a story of Tony Hastings (Gyllenhaal) driving at night in the middle of nowhere with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their daughter India (Ellie Bamber). They get run off the road by another car. It begins a nightmarish ordeal. Tony escapes without his family. Local police Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) investigates and zeroes in on Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).The problem with the story within the story is that the intensity is lost. It can't be real in the story telling sense and any tension is limited by that speed restriction. Otherwise, that inner story would make a nice tense neo-western. The outer shell story would benefit by skimming the inner story. It would concentrate the mind and make this a story about a marriage. Tom Ford creates a very beautiful looking movie. The overall structure needs some rethinking. There is a philosophical debate to be had. I also thought Isla Fisher was Amy Adams at first. It would actually be interesting to see Amy play both roles making her see herself in his book. While Ford has a great eye for beauty, there are story telling decisions that are questionable.",Nocturnal Animals
1,Hitchcoc,Can We Stand the Characters--That's the Key,8,25 May 2017,"I'm giving this rating because it is more important to me that a director try something new than fall back on clichés. As is usually the case with ""something new"" there are going to be fits and starts and not everything works. The attempt was to show us the nocturnal animals. In the case of the novel, they are predatory, redneck men who single out a family in a car, heading for a vacation house. The threat is heavy and palpable, and we know that when they try to ""help,"" they are doing so to get what they want. Jake Gyllenhaal's character would like to believe that they will have their fun and then back off. We know that's not going to happen. The desolation of the desert and the fabric of the Western setting also tell us that lawlessness can pretty much call the shots. The sheriff, dying of lung cancer, becomes pivotal. He is desperate and has been mistreated during his time as a lawman. He's willing to go all out, but Gyllenhaal has no plan of his own. Meanwhile, we are focused on artist, Amy Adams, who is living the angst of one who never seems to quite make it and who is in a loveless marriage. Her handsome guy is always away on business and sleeps around with little effort to hide things. She is a nocturnal animal, in that nighttime is endless. When her ex-husband (Gyllenhaal--in the flesh--not the victimized father) emerges after nineteen years, they hook up. But his hesitation and vacillating are still things that turn her off. But the book--the book--is captivating to her. She starts to see him as more than he is. He also needs her love and approval. She has hoped not to be seen as a dilettante her whole career, but may be headed down the road to emptiness. This is a really interesting film, even if at times it slips.",Nocturnal Animals
2,Horst_In_Translation,Read a book with Amy Adams,6,2 February 2017,"Here we have ""Nocturnal Animals"", an American movie written and directed by Tom Ford. For Ford, it is only his second movie despite him being already in his mid-50s. The first was ""A Single Man"" from 2009 that brought Colin Firth his first Oscar nomination. And this one we have here got Michael Shannon his second actually. These almost two hours were among the big players this awards season, even if it did come short at the Oscars. It won Aaron Taylor-Johnson a surprise Golden Globe and got Ford screenplay and director nominations. And at the BAFTAs, it scored even more attention. The two lead actors here are Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal, but they are not half as memorable as Shannon or ATJ. At least, in Adams' favor you can say that she is not really part of the core story and does not have too much to work with compared to others, but just of the framework, while Gyllenhaal once again ends up very underwhelming despite having the baitiest moments of the movie. On Adams, make-up and hair design still make her somewhat memorable. Shannon's success here says a lot really. The character was not written too well. The story of a cop who has nothing to lose because of a disease isn't anything new. There are no baity moments with him and his son and the cancer reference is also nothing that got elaborated on. But still Shannon gives easily the most memorable performance of the movie and that deserves all the awards he can get. ATJ wasn't bad either, but honestly a Golden Globe may have been a bit too much, maybe it also has to do with the fact that we see him naked and wiping his ass or with the transformation he managed since Kick-Ass.Anyway, now about the story itself. We have a woman who gets the manuscript of the new book by her ex-husband and while the story early on is still about her, the more it goes on the more it is really about her having moments of fear from what she is reading. Adams is sure much better than this. So yeah, the heart and soul is really the book itself and it's actually a really interesting idea by Ford here that we are basically visually reading a book in this movie. Something pretty new and refreshing. But there are weaknesses too, for example the worst moment was probably a jump scare scene involving a baby that could have been taken out of a really bad horror film and added nothing of quality at all. The ending of Gyllenhaal's character makes hardly no sense at all. But luckily, this film has Shannon and, to a lesser extent, Taylor-Johnson who still make it all work, even if the connection between the two scenarios feels extremely vague to me. It's more like two films in one and the one with Adams is extremely forgettable, while the other is okay, but nothing too new either, but luckily gets carried by two good performances. This is why overall I give this one a thumbs-up. Quality-wise, it is roughly what I expected, not a great film by any means, but kinda entertaining thanks to its style. Watch it, especially if you like some of the actors.",Nocturnal Animals
3,claudio_carvalho,Great Deception,3,1 January 2017,"In Los Angeles, the wealthy owner of an art gallery Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) has a loveless marriage with Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), who is cheating on her. Out of the blue, she receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) entitled ""Nocturne Animals"" and dedicated to her. They have been divorced for nineteen years and now Edward is asking for her opinion. The novel is about a man called Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is traveling on vacation by car with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber) through a lonely road. Out of the blue, a car bumps their car and throws them off the-road. The troublemakers Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Turk (Robert Aramayo) abduct Laura and India while Lou (Karl Glusman) dumps Tony in an isolated road. Tony walks to the police station and ranger Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) finds Laura and India raped and murdered. Meanwhile Susan recalls her relationship with Edward and rekindles her love for him. ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a deceptive movie by Tom Ford. The overrated IMDb rating associated to the names of Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal increases the deception of any viewer. Tony Hastings is a weak and unlikable character. The two segments are poorly resolved and the conclusion of each segment is awful. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Animais Noturnos"" (""Nocturnal Animals"")",Nocturnal Animals
4,nogodnomasters,Any time any place,6,16 August 2017,"Amy Adams (Susan) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Edward/Tony) give us great performances in a rather subdued script which consists of a story within a story. Susan has a failing art gallery that shows contemporary art of questionable quality. She comes from wealth. Her second husband Hutton (Armie Hammer) displays signs of having an affair, although this is never confirmed one way of the other. What is clear is that the couple has fallen apart as Susan drifts into melancholy. She receives a manuscript from her first husband Edward, a wannabe author. She reads the manuscript and sees Edward as the lead character Tony and similar people as herself and daughter for their roles. The book is shown to us as a subplot of the film. It is strictly ""B"" film material of a car jacking in west Texas, but she loves it. We are also fed flashbacks of Edward and Susan and we also see the overly made up Susan in the present in her 40's.Yes, the film has a point, one that is visual and read into the face of Amy Adams at the end...excellent acting and directing. In spite of all the praise, I didn't feel entertained, as I kept waiting for something real to happen, as the most telling scene was the board meeting when Susan seems to have a change of heart, perhaps the climax of the production. Not for me, although artsy people may love it.Guide: F-word. Naked man sitting on toilet, although no genitals show. Implied rape. No real sex or nudity.",Nocturnal Animals
5,kosmasp,Sleepless/Restless,10,18 June 2017,"While that would apply to my current state too (it's almost 4 am at the time of writing this), I am obviously talking about the movie. It's really a wicked one. It's so entangled and webbed in together, that it does warrant repeated viewings. If you are into that sort of mind twisting story telling that is of course.I'm not even giving anything away, because you can tell by the beginning act or by the trailer if you watched that. It's not a movie that you can just watch lightly. It does need your full attention. Again, that does not mean it is a movie that you'll like. That is a matter of taste. But technically speaking and acting wise, this is superb. The suspension is killing the viewer ... no pun intended. So ... What? Exactly, this may be your reaction at the end of it (or even during the movie) ... I'd argue that is a good thing, in this case",Nocturnal Animals
6,classicsoncall,"""...our world is a lot less painful than the real world.""",8,23 March 2021,"As the story within a story concept plays out, we learn that Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) relives a former relationship which in her own mind, she ended miserably and with little compassion for her ex-husband. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the ex, Edward Sheffield, along with a character in the book written by him. The fictional story, titled ""Nocturnal Animals"", progresses along the lines of a Stephen King novel or screenplay, and contains levels of violence that often brings Susan out of her reverie long enough to have her reflect mournfully on her past and the guilt that goes along with it. You come to realize that his novel was Sheffield's form of revenge after his emotions festered over the course of two decades for not only the sudden breakup, but for the callous abortion Susan had that ended her association with him. In a way, the fictional story almost overwhelms the here and now of Susan's recollections because of it's graphic violence and the perversity of the characters that drive the fictional Hastings family off the road and initiate a night filled with terror. The novel's introduction of a dying police detective (Michael Shannon) raises the revenge stakes up a notch for Hastings, in turn symbolizing Edward Sheffield's determination to make Susan Morrow suffer for an unrequited past. The entire picture is very well done, with the transitions between the present, the past and the situations in the book's narrative occurring seamlessly enough that one doesn't get confused if you're paying attention. The only downside if there has to be one, was that gruesome opening with the naked fat ladies, but now that I mention it, you'll probably want to see it for yourself.",Nocturnal Animals
7,lee_eisenberg,a story will rise,9,9 July 2017,"In 2016, Amy Adams starred in what were probably the best movies of her career. There was Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"", wherein she plays a linguist who has to determine why extraterrestrial life forms have descended upon Earth. The other was Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"". Adams plays the ex-wife of a novelist (Jake Gyllenhaal). He has written a novel whose gritty plot reflects his view of their relationship. Reading it forces her to reminisce on her life.Tom Ford first came to my attention when I saw ""A Single Man"", about one day in the life of a closeted gay professor in 1962 Los Angeles. Like that movie, ""Nocturnal Animals"" focuses on memories and regrets. Although the story that Adams's character reads is fictional, the movie makes it look real. And there's some INTENSE stuff here (but none of it gratuitous; it reflects Gyllenhaal's character's interpretation of what happened in their lives).I'd say that Amy Adams got snubbed for an Oscar nod (as did Annette Bening for ""20th Century Women""). This is one movie that everyone should see. Also starring Michael Sheen, Michael Shannon, Armie Hammer and Laura Linney.",Nocturnal Animals
8,jboothmillard,Nocturnal Animals,8,30 August 2020,"I recognised the poster when I looked up the title of the movie, I was attracted to watching it by the good cast, the plot, and the high praise by critics, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Tom Ford (A Single Man). Basically, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a rich art gallery owner living in Los Angeles. She receives the manuscript for a novel written by her estranged ex-husband Edward Sheffield (BAFTA nominated Jake Gyllenhaal) along with an invitation for dinner while he is visiting. Susan is now married to unfaithful businessman Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), but she is upset that the marriage is deteriorating. Susan starts to read the novel, which is both dedicated to her and named Nocturnal Animals after Edward's nickname for her. She becomes consumed by the novel. In it, Tony Hastings (also Gyllenhaal) is a family man on vacation with his family, wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and daughter India (Ellie Bamber). Whilst driving at night through West Texas, they get entangled with three local troublemakers, Ray Marcus (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lou Bates (Karl Glusman), and Turk/Steve Adams (Robert Aramayo). After being forced off the road, Tony is powerless to stop Ray and Turk from kidnapping his wife and daughter, and leaving him with Lou, who forces him to drive Ray's car to the end of a road where he is abandoned. Tony manages to evade Ray and Lou when they return looking for him and makes his way to a nearby farmhouse to call the police. Detective Roberto ""Bobby"" Andes (Oscar nominated Michael Shannon) is assigned to the case. With Tony, they discover the bodies of Laura and India near an abandoned shack, they were raped and murdered. Tony is wracked with guilt. A year later, he is contacted by Andes and asked to identify Lou, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders of Laura and India. Shocked by the dark content and raw emotion of the novel, Susan reminisces about meeting Edward in college and their blossoming relationship. Susan's domineering mother Anne Sutton (Laura Linney) objected to the relationship, claiming that Edward was not worthy of Susan's affections and that he lacked the drive to achieve his goals; Susan ignored her mother and eventually married Edward. Back in the world of the novel, Turk has been fatally shot in a botched robbery, leaving Ray as the final culprit to be brought to justice. Andes arrests Ray, but due to lack of circumstantial evidence of his involvement, he is released. Andes is close to retirement and dying from terminal lung cancer, so with Tony's help, he takes matter into his own hands. They abduct Ray and Lou. Andes shoots Lou when he tries to escape, but Ray escapes. In the real world, Susan finds evidence of her husband's extramarital affair. She resumes reading the manuscript and recalls her troubled marriage to Edward. His fledgling career and her frustration and dismissive attitude of his literary aspirations caused the marriage to strain and culminated with Susan cheating on him with Hutton and divorcing Edward to marry him. Edward attempted to repair their relationship but stopped seeing Susan after learning that she was pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion. Back in the novel, Tony is on his own and tracks down Ray to the shack where Laura and India were killed. Ray admits to raping and murdering Laura and India, calling him weak. Tony fatally shoots him but is blinded when Ray hits him on the head with an iron bar. Tony stumbles outside, succumbing to a brain haemorrhage, he dies, and accidentally shoots himself in the abdomen falling on his gun. In the present day, Susan finishes reading the novel and arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant. Edward does not show up, and Susan waits alone as all other diners leave. Also starring Andrea Riseborough as Alessia Holt, Michael Sheen as Carlos Holt, Alessia's homosexual husband, Zawe Ashton as Alex, Jena Malone as Sage Ross, and singer Beth Ditto as TV Woman #2. Adams, Gyllenhaal, Fisher, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson all give terrific performances, this one of those art house style films that shocks and surprises in equal matter, from the bizarre and controversial opening featuring obese women dancing naked in slow motion, to the violence of the novel seen through the lead character's imagination, it all adds up to an intriguing, interesting and fascinating psychological thriller. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay for Tom Ford, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Original Music for Abel Korzeniowski, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!",Nocturnal Animals
9,rmax304823,Are You A Man Or A Jellyfish?,7,19 August 2017,"Now, more than ever, Americans seem to be thinking in binary terms. Something must be either ""good"" or ""bad"", with nothing in between. That appears to be the response to Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals."" It must be either an artistic breakthrough or a mess of pointless pomposity. I thought it was pretty good.The film opens with a naked and flabby old lady doing a dance. (Okay, I didn't get that part.) Then we meet Amy Adams, perhaps plumper than we remember, her pale mask-like face all garish with make up, half hidden by a perfectly groomed, perfectly dyed cascade of hair. She's an executive at a tony art gallery or something, sits in on meetings and voices her opinions decisively. She has a doctorate in fine arts from Columbia. We learn she comes from a pretty hoity-toity family. If we didn't know it before, we find out soon enough from her mother, Laura Linney in a terrible wig, who makes it plain that Adams and her boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhal, are not made for each other. Adams is strong willed while Gyllenhal, who is no more than a novelist manqué attending Columbia on a scholarship, is a weakling.And therein lies the tale. (I think.) After creative differences, Adams and Gyllenhal split up. But years later she receives a typed manuscript from Gyllenhal, a novel dedicated to her and entitled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" a title into which we should feel free to add whatever meanings we like. She begins reading the novel, a story about Gyllenhal and herself, no married and with an adolescent child, driving through the barren countryside of West Texas at night, being bullied off the road by a car full of greasy rednecks, teased and humiliated abominably, then kidnapped, with the two females ending up raped and brutally murdered, and Gylenhall wandering around among the creosote bushes until he finds a dying cop who, when the law fails them, manages to present Gyllenhall with the opportunity to shoot two of the men who abused his family.So does he shoot them? It depends partly on exactly how ""weak"" Gyllenhal is, and even more so on exactly what we mean by ""weak."" I can understand why some viewers might be annoyed. Tom Ford and his editor have gone ape. The framing story, in which Adams is reading the manuscript, is clear enough but then there are quick cuts to scenes taking place in the novel, then more quick cuts to Adams and Gyllenhal's first meeting in New York, then other quick cuts to their disagreements, then to scenes of Adams with her new mate, and -- well, it just makes you long for those old movies in which a harp played while pages were blown one by one from a calendar.Speaking of harps, the score by Abel Korzeniowski owes a considerable debt to Bernard Herrmann without being in any way a rip off. The photography is by Seamus McGarvey and is peerless. Really, it's beautifully shot. Not just because of the occasional rosy cloud formations but because of the precision with which the atmosphere of each scene is evoked. Sure, it's California and the Mojave, but it couldn't look more like Texas if it tried.The performances can't be faulted either, except for the few times when Gyllenhall's fictional character screws up his face and begins to weep with agony and indecision. I mean -- we already know what he's feeling. A hint would have done as well. Let's not paint the lily. Everyone is up to professional standards but the roughnecks who kidnap the family are superbly drawn, and Michael Shannon is the laconic sheriff expiring of lung cancer and he's unforgettable.Some people have said the whole movie is pointless but I don't know why. Towards the end Adams receives an invitation to meet her estranged husband for dinner at a restaurant. The note is signed ""Edward"", the name of Gyllenhal's character in the novel. She sheds most of her make up, dresses unostentatiously, and sits quietly at a restaurant table, drinking scotch, and waiting for Gyllenhall to show up so they can begin again. Evidently she thought it was the kind of novel that couldn't have been written by a jellyfish.",Nocturnal Animals
10,moonspinner55,"Sweet revenge, bitter",4,25 January 2017,"Tom Ford is a real filmmaking prodigy. With just one previous directorial effort under his belt (2009's surprisingly sensual ""A Single Man""), Ford has shown exceptional talent handling actors, and he has a definite eye for composition, location shooting and how long a scene should play...what he lacks is supervision. A gallery executive, fraught with weak finances and a shaky marriage, receives the final draft of a novel her ex-husband has written. She becomes absorbed by the gruesome story of a man who loses his wife and daughter to southern yahoos in the desert--and comes to see how the painful prose is relevant to her own house-of-cards existence. ""Nocturnal Animals"", adapted by Ford from Austin Wright's novel, ""Tony and Susan"", features tightly-controlled, anguished performances from its talented cast, but is long on repellent or inscrutable detail (a mysterious car pulling up to a security gate, a paper cut bleeding like a deep wound, a naked man sitting on a toilet--and wiping himself in a tight shot), as well as cheap shots, such as a ghostly ""boo!"" coming from a baby monitor. The movie, filled with unhappy and sometimes repulsive people, is certainly a polished piece of work open to interpretation, but perhaps a more judicious editor could have eliminated Ford's unnerving penchant for excessiveness. ** from ****",Nocturnal Animals
11,Quinoa1984,A film on fire - emotionally speaking.,10,26 November 2016,"In Nocturnal Animals - man what a title, sounds like a new bestseller! - love, loyalty and revenge all are used by a filmmaker with something engaging to bring us with things that make up much of how people live in the world. This is a slightly stylized reality just by nature of how Tom Ford scripts and shoots his film, with a Los Angeles and a West Texas that are distinct and people who could easily be clichés (see Jena Malone's brief role as Adams's co-worker at the art gallery, as she looks like she was dressed in something a fashion designer makes up in a nightmare, or just all of the terrible Texas white-trash, or even Michael Shannon to an extent), but there's a humanity all the actors bring so that material that is one way on the page becomes something else on the screen. Sure, Noctural Animals is pretty, and at times mortifying because what you see is shot with such a clear eye for the sleek surfaces of upper middle class LA as well as the dusty and bloody film noir Texas. But the film's also about something, about what turns the mind completely inside out which is, in large part, due to a hear becoming completely undone and broken, and this book that Amy Adams's character is reading throughout the movie (sort of like if Cormac McCarthy or Jim Thompson on a mean day wrote the Neverending Story I guess?) reveals as much if not more about herself than Edward, the character played by Jake Gyllenhall she divorced years before.Also, this story within the story, featuring two roles from Michael Shannon as a cancer-ridden don't-give-a-flying-f*** detective and Aaron Taylor Johnson as the slimiest backwoods scum ever (or, perhaps, the worst of rural America), is one of the fiercest, darkest, most gripping pieces of pulp fiction I've ever seen. I think this will have high re- watchability too. I had some nitpicks with it leaving the movie, particularly with the ending, but the longer today that I've sat with the film and processed what I saw, how these people treated each other in the past, what ends up happening over time with Susan as she may really be 'becoming' her mother as far as seeing Edward and what that has to do with the book, it more than makes sense - it's the only logical and emotionally satisfying way Ford could wrap things up.This is a great piece of post-modern cinema, and I think it would sit in well with people who dig Lynch but want something more, uh... literary, I suppose(?) Also features, easily, the most disturbingly memorable (or memorably disturbing) opening credits sequence you will see this year.",Nocturnal Animals

16,grantss,"Stylish, clever and intriguing film that needs a better ending",7,4 October 2017,"Susan Morrow is a successful gallery owner. She is married to businessman Hutton Morrow, who is constantly travelling. She receives a manuscript of a novel, Nocturnal Animals, written by her first husband, Edward Sheffield. The gritty content of the novel strikes a chord with Susan and she starts to remember the times she and Edward had together. While this draws her closer to him, there are unresolved issues between the two.Intriguing movie that operates on two levels. There's the relationship drama involving Susan and Edward and the crime drama in the novel. The novel becomes the story-within-a-story, with, cleverly, Jake Gyllenhaal as the link between the two. Having Amy Adams play Susan and Isla Fisher the lead female character in the dramatisation of the novel is also a masterstroke, due to them looking so alike. (I only realised that it was Isla Fisher once I saw the credits. I had to go back to her scenes to confirm it was her, I was so convinced the character was played by Amy Adams).Unfortunately, the two levels are not created equal. I found myself far more interested in the novel's story than the main story. The novel was unflinchingly gritty and included a good revenge plot and theme. The main story was interesting only for the Susan-Edward backstory, and didn't really progress much, feeling more like wrapping around the novel story, without contributing much itself.There was still heaps of potential for both stories and the movie as a whole though, but the conclusion is a bit of a let-down. The novel ends in strange, contrived-feeling, fashion. The main story and movie ends quite flat. I'm a veteran of many anticlimactic endings, so very little tends to surprise me, but I was genuinely surprised when the closing credits started to roll. I thought ""That can't possibly be it"". But it was.A more profound tying together of the two stories and a punchy ending (to both) and Nocturnal Animals would have been superb.This said, there is still a lot to be admired about the movie. The novel story was done well and was helped by great performances from Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal. Shannon received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his effort.

The back-and-forth from reality to the pouring outs of the novel are indeed novel but again the actors summoned give it their all particularly Shannon (copping a richly deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as the unspooling murder mystery's cancer-stricken lawman hellbent on solving a viciously violent final case at any cost.

19,view_and_review,Gyllenhaal Saves An Otherwise So-So Movie,6,27 March 2017,"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not an Amy Adams fan. And this movie did nothing to change my mind. But, even having said that: this was a decent movie. Nothing earth shattering, but good.Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow, an unhappy art dealer with a cushy life. While trying to manage her new marriage she gets a manuscript from her ex-husband, Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal). As she reads the manuscript we see the book play out in the manner she imagines. The movie bounces back and forth between Susan's current life, her past life with Edward and her visions of the manuscript. It gets a little sloppy at times or intentionally nebulous when trying to discern if we are watching the past, present or her vision of the book. I don't think there was any intent to confuse, in fact I think that her imagination of the book was just who she saw the characters as and one of them happened to be the same as her ex-husband.Interestingly enough, the book and what was happening in that was far more riveting than what was going on in Susan Morrow's life. The story within the story will evoke some strong emotions. But, as can be inferred by my synopsis, the focus of this movie is Susan Morrow. The movie is more or less a drama with some thriller elements that spice things up. I wasn't terribly impressed with Amy Adams though Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent. I think Gyllenhaal made the movie watchable. Take him and his character away and this movie would have been a major snore.",Nocturnal Animals
20,neil-476,Clever,8,16 May 2018,"Susan, despite her art gallery business, is an unhappy woman in an unhappy second marriage. Then Edward, her first husband, sends her the manuscript of his forthcoming novel - a tale of a family who fall foul of three intimidating young men on a remote Texas highway - and she is soon tied up in the narrative and its parallels with her life.I don't normally have much time for art-house films, and this is clearly an art-house film. But it tells two stories, and tells both of them brilliantly. The events of the novel are delivered as a suspense thriller, and are cross-edited with Susan's story and experience of reading the manuscript. The editing is superb: it is as artistic, in its own way, as the film itself, where sound and image are carefully considered and crafted throughout.The crime thriller aspect is a story we have probably seen before, but we care - as does Susan - about its resolution. I found myself caring less about Susan's own story, the ""real"" story, if you will, although this gradually changed as the parallels between Edward's novel and his marriage to Susan became clearer. And this was not least due to the brilliant stroke of having Jake Gyllenhaal play both Edward and the protagonist of his novel.The performances are first class. Gyllenhaal, in particular, impresses enormously in both roles, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as chief tough is unrecognisable.It is rare to see a film which is so obviously an art-house film but which also entertains and impresses as a mainstream piece of cinema, but Nocturnal Animals manages it, and I recommend it accordingly.",Nocturnal Animals
21,evanston_dad,Nasty and Pointless Exercise in Style Over Substance,5,14 April 2017,"This deeply unpleasant movie is evidence that fashion designer turned movie director Tom Ford does not have solid cinematic instincts.I felt this way about his previous directorial effort, ""A Single Man,"" and I feel it about ""Nocturnal Animals."" This film reeks of a director trying much too hard to force an artistic sensibility that doesn't know how to marry itself to the material it's imposed upon. We therefore get a lot of style and mighty little substance.It doesn't help that the substance we do get is either nasty and pointless, like the movie (or book) within the movie that finds Jake Gyllenhaal seeking revenge against the man who brutally raped and murdered his wife and daughter; or dull and pointless, like the listless scenes featuring Amy Adams moping around and lamenting the man who got away, the author (also played by Gyllenhaal) of the book just mentioned. The dramatization of the book is torture porn; the rest is just boring. For us to care about a failed relationship, we have to understand what was so great about the relationship in the first place, which we never see, and we have to care about the people in the relationship, who we don't really ever learn anything about.Michael Shannon plays a sadistic sheriff and received an Oscar nomination for making crazy for the umpteenth time in his career. The lead bad guy is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, whose most memorable scene finds him sitting buck naked on a toilet. I almost wish he had been nominated for an Oscar as well so that this could have been used as his nomination clip.Grade: C",Nocturnal Animals
22,ferguson-6,slick vs dusty,8,6 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. First rule of Write Club  ABC. Always Bring Conflict. Alright, so I blended famous lines from a couple of movies there, but the point is a good script inevitably has conflict throughout. Director Tom Ford (A Single Man, 2009) adapted the screenplay from Austin Wright's novel ""Tony and Susan"", and while significant conflicts abound, it's the multiple and vivid contrasts that take this one to the next level.Director Ford jolts us with one of the most unique and unwelcome opening scenes ever as the credits flash by. A high gloss art gallery is the setting for a combination of video/performance art taking place that could only be appreciated by those with very specific tastes  those who favor obese naked dancing ladies. Extremely obese and absolutely naked. It's not the last time we as viewers will be uncomfortable, but it is the last time we will chuckle (even if it is awkwardly).The curator of the art gallery is Susan, played by Amy Adams. She lives in a stunning, ultra-contemporary mansion with her picturesque husband played by Armie Hammer. Their relationship is apparently as cold as his business, resulting in an empty relationship and the need to maintain the façade with their friends while quietly selling off assets to buy time. On the day that he leaves on a ""business trip"", she receives a package containing a galley of her ex-husband Edward's (Jake Gyllenhaal) first novel  some interesting reading during her time alone.A creative story structure has Susan reading the book (dedicated to her) in bed while we ""see"" what she's reading/envisioning. The story starts out as just another road trip for a husband (Gyllenhaal in a dual role), wife (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter (Ellie Bamber). However, on the desolate back roads of west Texas things get intense - almost unbearably so. The young family is terrorized by a trio of rednecks led by sociopath Ray Marcus (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson in what is head and shoulders above anything he's done to date). What follows is the fear of every man  unable to protect his family, and every woman  being abducted.Thanks to flashbacks and some simple inferences, we soon realize the novel is corresponding to Susan and Edward's past relationship, as well as Susan's current situation. The previously mentioned contrasts really kick into gear. It's the past versus the present, west Texas tumbleweeds versus the sleek and glamorous art world, Susan's first artsy husband versus her new ideal one, young Susan versus current Susan, the physical beauty of those in Susan's world versus the grit and ugliness of the novel, and finally, reality vs what's not real.The revenge-thriller portion of the novel makes for fascinating story-telling, and we get drawn in fully once Michael Shannon (playing a west Texas detective) arrives on the screen. Always one to disappear into his role, this may be Mr. Shannon's best yet. Though he doesn't have significant screen time, we are mesmerized by him during his scenes. He and Gyllenhaal are terrific together. Also appearing in supporting roles are Michael Sheen, Andrea Riseborough, Jena Malone, and a chilling scene from Laura Linney as Susan's high society mother.The two parts of the film play off each other like Brian DePalma against Sergio Leone. Slick against dusty  but of course, there is misery and disappointment and deceit in each. The cinematography (2 time Oscar nominee Seamus McGarvey) and editing (Joan Sobel) are superb and complemented by a spot on score from composer Abel Korzeniowski (a mixture of Bernard Hermann and Basic Instinct). The ending may frustrate some (not me) and though it may not find a huge audience, a loyal fan base is quite likely.",Nocturnal Animals
23,phd_travel,A masterpiece,10,2 December 2016,"This is one of the best movies of the year. Involving from start to finish. An art gallery owner (Amy Adams) receives a manuscript of a novel by her ex husband (Jake Gyllenhall). Tom Ford directs two very different scenarios: 1. a glamorous world in LA where everyone is smartly dressed and 2. the manuscript set in rural Texan outback. He manages to keep it clear when moving between the various time frames and scenarios. It's stylish but not excessively when it needs to be eg the hideous Lucien Freud type art exhibition and raw when at other times during the terrifying outback kidnap etc. The scenes in the novel are so terrifying that I often had to tell myself it's just the novel within the movie. A top fashion designer and a top notch director as well.The technical aspects are praiseworthy. Cinematography is attractive and shows the viewer everything you need to see in the frame. With such clear direction none of the plot is obscured. So much better than some modern movies with too much darkness and wobbly camera work. The musical score is atmospheric and recalls Hitchcock. The cast. The supporting cast are superb in their minor roles. Armie Hammer is just right as the wealthy good looking second husband. Laura Linney gives the most effective materialistic maternal advice speech since Frances Fisher in the Titanic. The irony is she was right in a way. Aaron Taylor Johnson is one of the more convincing trashy killers in recent memory - many have tried to do the trashy killer thing and come across fake. Michael Shannon as the cop is well cast and manages to be sick looking. Amy Adams is very beautiful and manages to act and look younger when necessary. She has had to play opposite leading men younger than her and she pulls it off flawlessly. Jake Gyllenhall is powerful and effective. The story is involving, meaningful and thought provoking about the direction life can take and the consequences of our choices and values. The contrast between the two relationships is insightful. This is a story that makes one ponder after the ending",Nocturnal Animals
24,gradyharp,"'When you love someone you have to be careful with it, you might never get it again.'",10,25 February 2017,"Austin Wright chilling novel TONY AND SUSAN has been transformed into a film renamed NOCTURNAL ANIMALS by screenwriter/fashion designer/director Tom Ford whose other film A SINGLE MAN was equally extraordinary. The visual, delusional, fantasy embracing, and raw brutality of this film is complemented by very fine performances by some our finest actors of the time – even minute roles are managed by such luminaries as Laura Linney, Michael Sheen, Armie Hammer, Andrea Riseborough, Zawe Ashton, Jena Malone, Isla Fisher, Karl Glusman among others.The film opens silently at first with the screen filled with a morbidly obese completely nude female and gradually other equally (an even more) obese women are seen moving to music and eventually lying on platforms like artwork: the effect is startling but provide a solid overture to what we are about to experience. In short, a wealthy art gallery owner (Amy Adams, in a role that is most Oscar worthy) is haunted by her ex-husband's novel (Jake Gyllenhaal), a violent thriller dedicated to her which she interprets as a symbolic revenge tale about her failed marriage. With more detail, this is a story within a story in which the first part follows a woman named Susan who receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward, a man whom she left 20 years earlier, asking for her opinion. The second element follows the actual manuscript, called ""Nocturnal Animals,"" which revolves around a man whose family vacation turns violent and deadly. It also continues to follow the story of Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself. As Susan reads the unpublished novel (her current husband – Armie Hammer – is away on yet another trip) the novel comes to life as we watch Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) loose his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and daughter (Ellie Bamber) to the brutality of a trio of wild men – Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Lou (Karl Glusman) and Turk (Robert Aramayo): wife and daughter are sexually abused and killed. Tony finds help with the local cancer ridden sheriff Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) and together they enact revenge. All of this is happening as Susan identifies with Laura, extrapolating the story as a version of her own life as an unfulfilled artist, meeting the-ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhaal) who is visiting new York to see Susan's response to his long awaited first novel.There is so much more to this film than that brief synopsis, but the core response is the brilliance of actors Adams, Gyllenhaal, Shannon, and Taylor-Johnson. Why the Oscars passed over this stunning film is a question whose answer we will never know. Brilliant!",Nocturnal Animals
25,deloudelouvain,Well executed thriller,8,29 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals has everything a good movie needs. A great cast, perfect scenery's, an intriguing story and above all it's told in the perfect timing, not rushed at all. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon are two actors are really like so seeing them playing in the same movie is just a joy for me to watch. They both gave away a great performance especially Michael Shannon. And if you like red haired vamps you will be delighted because with Amy Adams, Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber you get three for one. Amy Adams is a delight to watch in Nocturnal Animals. By reading the novel her husband from 20 years ago wrote she relives in a way her story. It's a story in a story. A well written story with the right amount of suspense, especially in the beginning. Great directing from Tom Ford. Looking forward to watch his next movie. I really doubt this movie will get a lot of people with negative reviews like you always have with any other movie. I will definitely watch it again in the future.",Nocturnal Animals
26,christopher-underwood,grabs you by the throat,10,6 November 2018,"Not sure how I missed this upon theatrical release, maybe there was something about the publicity I took against. Anyway seen it now and it is a great viewing experience. Involving from the start, well to be honest it grabs you by the throat to the extent that you cannot envisage the film going on for much longer, and continues in similarly involving scenes, if not quite so violent. I understand that director Tom Ford originally envisaged turning the book, upon which it is based, into two separate movies but settled for entwining the two stories. Intelligent and spot on script that involves us both in the terrible Texas scenes and the (awful in their own way) Los Angeles rich life moments. Amy Adams is excellent as the poor little rich girl with regrets for a life lost and Lake Gyllenhaal great in both his roles. There is ambiguity throughout but then that is always preferable to the blatantly obvious. I should also mention the masterful look that is established both in the arty farty Californian lifestyle moments and in the desert scenes with the interstate and those fantastic skies.",Nocturnal Animals

Ford, in his second venture as a Writer-Director creates a world of bleakness & violence, with command. He directs this volatile film, with the essence of a seasoned filmmaker.'Nocturnal Animals' Synopsis: An art gallery owner is haunted by her ex-husband's novel, a violent thriller she interprets as a veiled threat and a symbolic revenge tale.'Nocturnal Animals' isn't for the faint-hearted. This is a dark & disturbing film & you ought to have a strong stomach to absorb it. Ford keeps the narrative dangerously twisted & the series of events that happen in the ""novel"", leave you engrossed & at times, angry. This is a film about failed relationships & how crime should never be overlooked, at any given time. Ford's Adapted Screenplay isn't perfect, in fact, the culmination looks hurried & we wish there was more depth in Amy Adams's character. But, for the most part, the Writing stays true to its subject & remains comfortably grim. Ford's Direction is Excellent. He is the star of the show & 'Nocturnal Animals' is definitely a high-point in his career. A special mention for the Cinematography & the Editing. Performance-Wise: Amy Adams portrays her part with mystery & a sense of guilt, displaying various emotions with her glazing eyes. Jake Gyllenhaal oozes versatility, enacting a non-heroic part with intensity. Michael Shannon has a ball playing a dedicated detective who's stop at nothing & Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a surprisingly loathsome villain. Laura Linney & Armie Hammer are effectual in bit roles.On the whole, 'Nocturnal Animals' isn't for everyone, but Ford's mastery needs to be watched, despite the narrative's imperfections.",Nocturnal Animals
28,blanbrn,"A film of compare and contrast it shows the connection between life, love, revenge, regret as it's all a symbolic tale.",8,11 December 2016,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is one of those movies as after you watch you leave being stunned and thinking about life in somewhat of a dark manner seeing that many times it's in the form of regret and tragedy. Many times life can imitate art and art can do the same of imitating life. And with director Tom Ford his directing is always a spotlight and showcase of showing the love of life and yet also how it's so often connected with pain and the dark nature of tragedy.The plot centers around Susan Morrow(in a fine turn from Amy Adams)who's an elegant high class society L.A. art gallery owner who kind of finds herself in a state of doubt. She's married now to a new guy yet, it's when Susan receives a novel from her ex-husband Ed Sheffield(Jake Gyllenhaal)that brings back the memories of doubt and guilt. As with each page that Susan reads and turns this violent thriller becomes more and more of a symbolic tale that seems like a memory of her life with Ed. As it's clear Ed set out to bring fright to Susan thru the pages of a novel, as it has Susan doing a flashback of her time with Ed.Good supporting turn is given from Michael Shannon as a west Texas detective named Bobby Andes his character in the novel was one that just really stood out as a dying man fighting for justice for the Ed Sheffield character after the murders of his fictionalized wife and daughter. Overall this picture will leave one thinking about life, love, and regret seeing that art and life are often symbolic and can damage and touch another person in life especially if they feel guilt from that of a loss of love and relationship. Really ""Nocturnal Animals"" is one wicked thrill ride dark journey of madness to sink your viewing teeth into.",Nocturnal Animals
29,lasttimeisaw,A movie one would go gaga for,8,12 September 2016,"Anticipation runs high for fashion designer Tom Ford's sophomore directorial outing after his stunningly sleek, candidly reflective debut A SINGLE MAN (2009), NOCTURNAL ANIMALS has just been crowned GRAND JURY PRIZE in Venice 73', which comfortingly bodes well for its prospect in the Oscar game ahead.I saw it in on a grand screen in Venice, the film kick-starts with stunning montages of female carnal corpulence, which turns out to be an opening night of a modern-art exhibition organized by Susan Morrow (Adams) in her sumptuous-looking gallery, this eye-opening gambit straight away shoots audience into a state of euphoria towards what we would regard in the offing. Susan lives in a posh residence with her business-oriented husband Walker (Hammer), and in fact, their relationship is teetering on the brink, Susan suspects the latter is cheating on her. The unbidden arrival of a manuscript written by her ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhaal), whom she jolted 20 years ago, casts her mind back to the bittersweet recollection of their jinxed relationship. They married for love, but Edward, a struggling writer, is deemed ""too weak"" for the ambitious, capable art student Susan, pinpointed by Susan's mother Anne (a matriarch Linney in her scene-stealing cameo, immaculately coiffed too), Susan boldly defies her assertion but, the truth is, mother is always right about her daughter and more disheartening, every daughter becomes her mother in the long run. The break- up is a big blow to Edward, not helped by him catching Susan with Walker in a date.The manuscript is a novel written by Edward with the titular name, and this story-within-a-story marks Ford's resolute departure from his wheelhouse - the upmarket ritz and glitz. Hence, he assuredly strides into his untested ground - a Western revenge thriller. In the novel, its protagonist, an ordinary guy Tony Hastings (Gyllenhaal again), embarks on a family vacation with his wife Laura (Fisher) and their daughter India (Bamber) in the backwoods of Texas, one night when they are driving on the highway, road rage is engendered between them and three local ruffians, Ray (Taylor-Johnson), Lou (Glusman) and Turk (Aramayo), strife follows and mounts to an unnervingly edge-of-your-seat intensity. Tony is not a violent guy, even during the distressing moment when Laura and India are strong-armed into riding with Ray and Turk in their vehicle, meanwhile Lou forces Tony to drive in another with him, Tony comes off too powerless to save his family (one important detail, the ruffians are unarmed, so in hindsight, there is a fainting chance if Tony is strong and brave enough, he might be able to take down his rivals), thus, the tale sends its harrowing message: it is Tony's ""weak"" nature that should be at least partially responsible for the tragedy incurred to his wife and daughter, but is it? (I think some of us will differ.)With all the efficiency and predictability of police procedural and post-trauma recovery, Tony's revenge, exacted one year later - which is aided by detective Bobby Andes (Shannon), who is bent on seeking justice within their own hands - eventually hinges on the central question, can a civilized man pull the trigger when facing rank vice, even he has an irrefutable motivation to do so? In another world, can Tony pass the ultimate manhood test, to be a man defined by a rigid frame of mind?The manuscript drastically stirs Susan's psyche, she is intrigued, emotionally affected by the story's undercurrent of emasculation and humiliation, and attempted to meet Edward for the first time in 20 years, but what awaits her is something she might not expect - Edward's belated revenge, two decades later, which will shoot her down when she is at her most vulnerable.Gyllenhaal continues his extraordinary stretches of virtuosity in front of the camera, unleashes his show-stopping elemental intensity in his dual roles, especially in Tony, a character poles apart from his strapping figure, a meek sheep unfairly punished for his nature, it is a heartbreaking display of bravura. By contrast, Adams epitomizes a more detached persona nestled in her privileged niche, outlines a more subdued inner journey aptly paralleling Tony's trials and tribulations, and eventually it would strike a more resonant chord with viewers. Shannon, stands out in his effortless turn as a terminally-ill Texan cop equipped with irresistible tics, brazenly unperturbed in his relentless hunt. And, Taylor-Johnson, whose stardom hardly takes off after his breakthrough in Matthew Vaughn's KICK-ASS (2010), has been further pigeonholed in extremely unsympathetic roles notwithstanding, finally finds a knack to lighten the screen with his repugnant cockiness to a fault. Incredibly, there are captivating and hilarious cameos galore, barring aforementioned Linney, Andrea Riseborough, Jena Malone and the unrecognizable TRUE BLOOD star Kristin Bauer van Streten are all smashing one-liners.Finally, a big thumb up to Mr. Ford, NOCTURNAL ANIMALS comes out brilliant and thought- provoking after ingeniously blending two rather incongruous styles within one feature-length, it is a gorgeous testimony that filmmaking shouldn't take the seat of a second fiddler for this multi- talented taste-maker, not in a world we need someone like him whose reading of masculine culture is far much perceptive than the dispiriting status quo.",Nocturnal Animals
30,KineticSeoul,A depressing and yet very realistic revenge story,9,9 January 2017,"This is one of those films that will resonate with audiences that have deep understanding of it. People that has experienced, witnessed and went through heartbreaks. By pouring your effort and passion into someone before and was left with nothing. Except with just memories of the past and what you did together with that person. A lot of men are driven by ego and when that ego is stepped on, you want to prove your worth to that person or others that wasn't there for you when you needed them. In another words to prove a point to the people that let you down. That you can do what you set out to do without that person in your life. That is the main drive of this story, and it's told through metaphors through a book manuscript. So in a way it's a story within a story, one being real and the other being fiction but written in a way that shows the authors pain, anguish and anger. I will admit, if I saw this movie when I was still a teenager I would have thought it was a pretentious art film. But watching it now, I can't help it but think of it as a piercing art film.9/10",Nocturnal Animals
31,Hellmant,Disturbingly involving.,9,16 December 2016,"'NOCTURNAL ANIMALS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A neo-noir thriller from sophomore filmmaker Tom Ford (who first helmed 2009's 'A SINGLE MAN'). The film was once again written and directed by Ford, and it's based on the 1993 novel 'Tony and Susan' (by Austin Wright). It tells the story of an art gallery owner, that's disturbed by the violent content of a manuscript that her estranged ex-husband sent her. She's also trying to cope with current marital problems, while also reflecting on all of the relationship choices she's made throughout her adult life. The movie stars Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Ellie Bamber and Armie Hammer. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been nominated for multiple major awards; including Golden Globes for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Taylor- Johnson). I found the film to be very well made, and disturbingly involving. Susan Morrow (Adams) is a highly stressed art gallery owner, that's also having relationship problems with her husband, Hutton (Hammer). She unexpectedly receives a manuscript, from her estranged ex- husband Edward Sheffield (Gyllenhaal), asking her opinion on it. She hasn't spoken to Edward in several years, and she feels like she really betrayed him (in the past). Upon reading the novel, which Edward dedicated to her (and titled after his nickname for her, 'Nocturnal Animals'), Susan becomes quite disturbed by it's content. She also fears that the upcoming book is some kind of a threat, and a form of revenge. The movie also thoroughly depicts the events of the novel as well.The movie is very dark, and quite depressing (don't expect a happy ending). It's also beautifully stylistic, and quite involving; both the main story, and the story inside the story. Adams, Gyllenhaal, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson all give quality performances, and the characters are all complex and realistic. The film is also pretty intense, at times, and psychologically interesting as well. It's a very creative piece of art, especially for those that love neo-noir filmmaking.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bryytrjyDdI",Nocturnal Animals

the ending, or lack of one, just pissed me off so much. it was such a book-ending. i saw a youtube video on the ending, thinking it was perfect that he got revenge by becoming successful and doing what she said he wasn't capable of, and then giving her a glimmer of hope before taking it away. i get that, and it is fitting, but it just was so ridiculously unsatisfying, an absolute wtf moment when he stood her up and they cut to blacksomething cool that i would have liked to see is if they kept it hidden that this was a revenge story, reveal that at the end when shows up completely messed up and angry and deranged, and laughs at her for not realizing he wrote the book to hurt her. maybe make her visions of the book show that he is fighting to get her back, and then at the reveal show his vision when he wrote it as seeking vengeance",Nocturnal Animals
33,Robert_duder,"A horrifyingly awful example of ""artsy"" crap",1,31 December 2016,"So I'm a film lover and I've seen plenty of fantastic art pieces and indie films that were amazing. Nocturnal Animals was NOT one of them. This is the type of movie that is either way too intellectual for me or pretends to be. I don't even think I understand what went on throughout the course of the film. It's about life imitating art or vice versa I have no idea and I want to care but I don't. If this utter drivel gets any Oscar nominations I might throw up. I had to force myself through it and I can't think of a single redeeming quality except for maybe that the lead actors are all very good at being intense, you just won't understand why they're intense.Amy Adams is an okay actress in my book but I'm also feeling the over saturation. She seems to get used in films over and over and over again and because they tend to be critical darlings which means she often plays bizarre over the top roles that her sweet innocence fits somehow with a dark twist. She is appropriately messed up in this. I don't know about what....I'm confused. Please don't nominate her for an Oscar. Jake Gyllenhaal is also a very good actor who often takes strange, twisted roles. His performance last year in Nightcrawler worked better than this. He's a writer and he wrote this book where he's married to Adams but she gets murdered and...I dunno. I will say they're chemistry is good so there is that. Michael Shannon shows up as a grizzled cop who looks like I felt all the way through the movie.So who is Tom Ford? Someone who wrote two screenplays now and directed them both. I don't think I've seen A Single Man but I'd be hesitant to now. Maybe like I said this is his art and I don't get it but I really didn't get it. This was a mess that made 0 sense to me. Unless you want something to unpack and explore or you're someone who just loves indie film and art this is completely miss-able trust me! 1/10",Nocturnal Animals
34,MOscarbradley,A remarkable piece of work,9,23 November 2016,"In Tom Ford's superb new movie the nocturnal animals of the title could refer to any of the characters and that title could be taken in a number of ways. After all, aren't we all animals. capable of hurting and even killing in the name of love or simply lust? Once you peel away the veneer of social mores aren't these the basic instincts you are left with? ""Nocturnal Animals"" is also the title of the book Edward has written and which is acted out for us as a story within the main frame of the film. He has sent it to his ex-wife Susan and Ford's film alternates between her life as a successful but unhappily married artist in LA and the fictitious story in Edward's book as she reads it. There are also flashbacks to Susan's early life and her marriage to Edward.As the film progresses it becomes clear that there are parallels between Edward's novel and Susan's life though it would be unforgivable to say too much in a review since this is a film that expects its audience to fill in the blanks and find the clues that will lead us to its sad, devastating climax. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Edward, seen briefly in flashbacks, and also the central character in Edward's novel. Watching the film I thought he was the weakest element in an otherwise engrossing scenario but on hindsight I can see now how brilliantly Gyllenhaal encompasses this weak, nonentity of a man, (or men). But this is Susan's picture and in that role Amy Adams is extraordinarily good. Hers is a complex and not particularly sympathetic character and Adams really gets inside her head. However successful she may be as an artist her failure as a human being is almost complete; she is indeed a nocturnal animal but as I have said this is a film in which any character could fit that description and in Edward's novel the animals are much more feral, their actions much less cerebral. In a brilliant supporting cast, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and, in a showy one scene cameo, Laura Linney are outstanding.As befits a man who is a designer first and a film-maker second, Ford's movie is incredibly beautiful to look at. Seamus McGarvey's images are breathtaking. Here is a film that dazzles the eye just as it simultaneously teases the brain. Ford himself wrote the screenplay from Austin Wright's novel ""Tony and Susan"". It's a remarkable piece of work in every respect and the more I reflect on it the better it gets.",Nocturnal Animals
35,ThomasDrufke,Unsettling but Brilliant,8,3 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals is probably the closest thing we will get to 2014's Gone Girl without feeling like a complete copycat. Tom Ford's psychological thriller is unsettling from the opening frame and never lets the tension stop until the film's finale. This is quite simply, one of the most unique experiences I have had at a theater this year.I have yet to see Tom Ford's first film, A Single Man, but it's fascinating that someone coming from the world of fashion, can make such a captivating movie. Especially, a film that doesn't waste a single second of screen time on useless scenery. Instead, Ford's adaptation of Austin Wright's novel is tight and features some effectively unique storytelling.Told using three separate narratives; one as Susan (Amy Adams) is reading Edward's (Jake Gyllenhaal) book, Nocturnal Animals, the other as Susan is looking back on her relationship with Edward, and finally the actual events of the book. It's a rather haunting tale of revenge, betrayal, and even perception vs reality. I won't blame people if they think the film is pretentious from the opening few minutes, but when you dig deep into the layered story lines, there's world class Hollywood talent at work here. Gyllenhaal, Adams, Michael Shannon, and even Aaron Taylor-Johnson bring their characters to life in a disturbingly realistic way. Particularly, Taylor-Johnson, who brought something as Ray Marcus that I had never seen him come even close to having as an actor before.Though I will say, Nocturnal Animals doesn't always pay off the way you expect it to. It's kind of like Gone Girl in that way, sometimes you were hoping for this story to link up more fluently with that story and so on. But it's all part of the feeling Ford is hoping will resonate with his audience. He's keeping the audience on their toes from the beginning, and isn't letting off the gas pedal until the credits stop rolling. My only major gripe is that sometimes, within the book's narrative, characters don't seem to have proper motivation or reasoning. Michael Shannon's character has that eerie charm that most of his roles do, but I was confused sometimes as to his reasoning behind his actions.But that's really it. It's one of my favorite thrillers of the year. I think Amy Adams may get overlooked for her performance because of her turn in Arrival, but there are still plenty of awards Nocturnal Animals should be up for. I would love to see this get a best picture nod, though it seems very unlikely at this point. Overall, it's heartbreaking, cringe worthy, grotesque, but also intricately put together. It hits all the right beats.+Three stories intertwine nicely+Unsettling in a good way+Ford's tight writing/directing8.4/10",Nocturnal Animals

37,lesleyharris30,"Thrilling Story and Splendid Performances,",8,29 July 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a very engrossing story that is truly told like no other, it was amazing to see two separate plots in one and how they interconnected with each other. We follow Susan Morrow, as she reads a book her husband dedicated to her, and also get taken in to the book itself. The layers to the plot are incredible, and the cinematography used to convey this strange world is magnificent. I was a little disappointed by the conclusion, not that I would have hoped for a better ending, but I just thought it finished very abruptly. I was surprised when the credits began to roll, I felt like there was still more to be told, a lot of questions left unanswered. I would like to have seen a proper confrontation between Susan and Edward, there is very little scenes with them together, it just left me a little underwhelmed. The cast is all around phenomenal, Amy Adams delivers a rich, somber performance, Michael Shannon is a rough, shady officer who is very intriguing to watch as we never know what he is going to do next, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who steals every scene he is in with his extremely unlikeable character, very surprising work by him. The highlight is without a doubt Jake Gyllenhaal, playing two characters in this, both with a lot of eloquence. While Tony and Edward are not extremely different, he does enough subtle changes with both parts for us to know the difference, he is absolutely spellbinding in this role, every cast member is doing some of their best work here. A slow moving film that provides the best possible thrills. Terrific dialogue, performances and cinematography, we really see Tom Ford's unique vision get brought to life here, and I would recommend Nocturnal Animals to anyone looking for a good thriller. A woman gets sent a book by her ex husband that he wrote in dedication to her, she soon discovers this gesture is not as kind as it may seem. Best Performance: Jake Gyllenhaal",Nocturnal Animals

Susan Morrow (Adams) is a high end art gallery owner who is struggling with her life. Outwardly she has everything, but internally she is empty. When she receives a manuscript from her ex-husband Tony (Gyllenhaal) she notices something strange. Now the line between fiction and reality is blurred and Susan isn't sure what to think about what she is reading. This is a difficult movie to review. On one hand the movie is very tense and emotional with a very dark story to it which makes it hard to watch. On the other hand the acting is so great that it makes you want to keep watching just so you can experience what you are seeing. The movie itself seems to be all over the place though and really tries a little too hard to be important and send a message. It's a movie that tries to be an art-house picture but ends up being a little too pretentious which hurt it a little as well. All that said, the movie is decent and worth watching, but a little too slow and disturbing for me to fully say it's a must see.

39,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,15 February 2017,"Nocturnal AnimalsThe hardest part of writing a best selling novel is finding a talented enough ghostwriter. Fortuitously, the author in this thriller has found his own voice.Successful art curator Susan (Amy Adams) is shocked to receive a manuscript from her ex- husband (Jake Gyllenhaal). It tells of a family man whose family (Isla Fisher, Ellie Bamber) is murdered, and his work with an ailing detective (Michael Shannon) to bring their killer (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to justice.Filled with allusions to the affair she had with her current husband (Armie Hammer), Susan can't help but be moved by this gesture, especially since her present marriage is deteriorating. With its superb cast and ethereal direction from Tom Ford, this absorbing, multilayered and multi-narrative psychological love story beautifully blurs the lines between fact and fiction, inspiration and revenge.Nevertheless, literary retaliation is the exact reason why you shouldn't marry a writer.

I liked what i saw, but i didn't get it at the end. There are two stories here, one with a women and her surrounding in a some sort of fashion world, where great actors like Michael Sheen pop up on screen for 2 minutes and then disappears. The other is about the same woman reading a book sent by her ex husband which contains a gritty story totally different from our prime story. Or isn't? I loved the second story, which could have (and did work) as a superb thriller. Performances in a ""second"" story were great by everyone involved, especially by a great Michael Shannon who won Oscar nomination here - superb acting. But i wasn't confused when even he suddenly disappeared from screen - this happened a lot in this movie. So you think these two stories will collide somehow by the end?

42,Reno-Rangan,re-ven-ge,6,24 February 2017,"This was simply awesome. I meant the story, but the presentation was not my kind. I got the story and I enjoyed it. The performances can't be neglected either. Both the lead, Jake and Amy were the film's highlight. But I also happy for Michale Shannon's Oscars nominee. Based on the novel 'Tony and Susan', but for the film adaptation, the title got inspired by the book that appear in the story. From the director of 'A Single Man' which is his comeback film after a long gap. I would say a good attempt.This is the story of a successful art gallery boss who got divorced and remarried to the man whom she was cheating with from her ex. Her decision was in particular influenced by her mother. Now she thinks she's happy, but one day her ex sends a copy of his latest novel that's dedicated in her name. Reading it, she realises the tough time he'd with their separation. Following the end of the book, she encounters an unexpected truth which could affect her life forever.A dual layer story. One was fiction and the other one in the real world. But the fictional tale highly influences the main narration and that's what I call the genuine writing. So the credit must go to none other than the original author. I have seen lots of revenge films, even it can be compared to 'Three Colours: White', but the major difference is the sweet revenge. For that alone the film was awesome. The climax was even better. If you understand the narration, you will enjoy it for sure. The filmmaking should have been a bit better.

43,sol-,Storytelling,8,20 November 2016,"Reading her ex-husband's latest manuscript, a violent crime thriller, a gallery owner is plagued by regrets in this stylish, near postmodern movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams. The film is superbly edited with the narrative smoothly transitioning back and forth between Adams reading and thinking about the novel and the events of the novel playing out, in which Gyllenhaal plays the protagonist (in addition to her ex-husband in flashback). There are many clever graphic and audio matches as what Adams does on the 'outside' mirrors what Gyllenhaal does on the 'inside', and the choice to call the film 'Nocturnal Animals' -- the name of her ex's story -- is very much on point. Gripping as the story within is, the overall story is about how Adams reacts to the novel, and adding a further layer, we are then positioned as a viewer to not only react to the story-within but the overall story too (one could imagine a movie being made about someone watching and reacting to the movie). Postmodern elements aside, the film is an enticing ride. Gyllenhaal has rarely offered such an intense performance and it is a layered one too given that his story-within character is a representation of the author's deepest insecurities. Michael Shannon is also effective and deserves all of the plaudits he has received. Criticisms are easy to make with the 'outer' story so much less remarkable than the 'inner' one, but the film works overall and the suggestive, ambiguous ending works better the more one thinks about it. Say what one may, the film is a testament to the power of good storytelling to make one reflect on one's life. Who would have thought that such an exciting film could be made from the simple premise of having a character read a book?",Nocturnal Animals
44,tomgillespie2002,Expertly crafted crime psychodrama,8,11 April 2017,"Seven year after fashion designer Tom Ford surprised everyone by delivering a tender, stylish romance with A Single Man, the writer/director returns for another tale of romantic exploration tinged with danger and sadness. Adapted from Austin Wright's 1993 novel Tony and Susan and renamed Nocturnal Animals for the screen, Ford expertly weaves three narratives, each with their unique look, tone and mood, into a brooding character study. One of the few criticisms thrown at A Single Man was its tendency to place style above substance, but I disagreed at the time, and offer Nocturnal Animals as proof that Ford is a skilled director who balances aesthetic and narrative seamlessly, and often to devastating effect.The film opens with shocking images of obese women dancing provocatively, and naked, in front of the camera. It's the opening of artist Susan Morrow's (Amy Adams) latest work, and it's a hit amongst the champagne-guzzlers who occupy the room. Susan seems to have everything: a lavish, modern mansion; a wardrobe full of expensive clothes; and a dashing (and rich) husband in Hutton (Armie Hammer). Everything, that is, other than happiness. At a dinner with her pompous artists friends (including a scene-stealing Michael Sheen), she voices her concerns about her husband's suspected affairs and her struggle to take herself seriously in her line of work. As Hutton jets off on a business trip, Susan is home alone when she receives a package from her ex-husband Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal). It's a draft of his finished novel, called Nocturnal Animals.There a multiple stories within the film, and we are transported into the novel as Susan reads it. It begins with a family driving down a deserted highway at night when they are suddenly run off the road by a group of rednecks. The father (also Gyllenhaal) attempts to diffuse the situation by offering to pay for the damages, but the hooligans, headed by the psychopathic Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) wind up kidnapping the wife and daughter. The further this dark, violent tale takes us, the clearer it becomes that it is mirroring Susan's reality, and that there may be a hidden message in there somewhere. Is Tony f*****g with his ex-wife for a prior incident, or could it be his bizarre way of trying to win back her affections? Either way, this fictional narrative clearly holds the key to unravelling the couple's part turmoil, and the mindset of both Tony and Susan after their marriage fell apart.The performances are impressive throughout. Adams demands your attention whenever she graces the screen, expressing the most powerful of emotions with the subtlest of facial movements. Michael Shannon, who was shockingly the only one of the four leads to receive an Oscar nod, is particularly memorable as a long-past- giving-a-f**k Texan lawman riddled with cancer. Yet it's Ford who emerges as the star, delivering an expertly crafted crime psychodrama that is both a curious study of the grotesque bourgeois and a lean, mean Texas revenge thriller. While it's certainly true that the male characters are much more layered than the females, the film received unfair accusations of misogyny upon its release, which may explain its absence from the major categories during awards season. It's a shame, as Nocturnal Animals deserves some recognition for its intoxicating cocktail of Hitchcockian tension, gritty human drama, and decadent visuals.",Nocturnal Animals
45,cruise01,"Nocturnal Animals impressive performances, direction, and script. But the film is only worth seeing once.",6,11 April 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a mind twister that may throw off viewers if they walk out to the bathroom and miss a scene. It may not be for everyone with the direction the film is trying to take. Some may find it boring, disturbing or intrigued with the psychological thriller direction. I found the movie to be quite fair with a great cast ensemble, some visually tone direction, and a plot that would be difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. Director Tom Ford did deliver a good script based on a novel. The plot follows gallery owner Susan (Amy Adams) when she receives a novel called Nocturnal Animals which she becomes obsessed and raw with emotions after reading it. Meanwhile, Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal) is going on a family vacation with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter. On a road trip across Texas, they get run off the road by Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his two men. Everything gets taken for the worse, when Tony and the Detective Bobby (Michael Shannon) are on the hunt for these men and to find Tony's wife and daughter. If you enjoy films that makes you think and realize between the two narratives structure and how they relate. Then, you may find the film to be worthy. If you don't, I would not recommend it. The concept idea playing with the whole story within a story was pretty neat. The script delivered a good structure with the two stories. This is one film with a lot of memorable actors in the film like Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, and Michael Sheen. Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal gave some powerful emotional performances with their characters. It had some raw emotions, which can be quite hard to watch. And some frustrating moments with characters choices. Nocturnal Animals is a fair psychological thriller film; has a neat concept idea of story within a story and leaves open for interpretations for many viewers. Has a variety of talented cast in the film and highlighted performances from Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal.",Nocturnal Animals
46,zkonedog,Something Is Missing From This Film,5,26 March 2017,"Based on my usual/previous film tastes, I should rank ""Nocturnal Animals"" much higher than this middle-of-the-road five stars. I generally tend to like films that are about something more than what is portrayed on the surface, and ""Nocturnal Animals"" certainly fits the bill in that regard. That being said, however, there is just something about this movie that left me feeling underwhelmed and perhaps even a little disappointed.For a basic plot summary, ""Nocturnal Animals"" tells the story of Susan (Amy Adams), a very successful art designer who ""has everything"": prestige...money...style/beauty...home. The problem? She rarely ever sleeps, and current husband Hutton (Armie Hammer) is never around. In short, she is very dissatisfied with her life. One day, she receives a manuscript from ex- husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is dedicated to her. As she reads Edward's story (a tale depicted on screen as a man losing his wife and daughter in West Texas and hunting down the men who kidnapped them), she flashes back to her time spent with Edward in hopes of understanding why it is devoted to her.I'll start with the good: ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a rather fascinating film for the way in which it uses storytelling techniques to get its point across. It is heavy on allegory, as well as uses flashbacks and the visualization of a written narrative. Suffice it to say, there is a lot to unpack in terms of how the story is told. I like that inventiveness in film-making. Having a great cast doesn't hurt, either.I think the biggest problem I had with the film, however, is that it seemed like some of the stylistic choices only served to distract from what I feel should have been the main plot of the story. SPOILER ALERT (minor) here, but ""Nocturnal Animals"" really works when it tackles the themes of relationships and the power that artistic expression can have on real life events. That angle is a fascinating one. However, I felt as if director Tom Ford treated the film like a ""big reveal"" picture (when really it is not), using distraction that in this case actually detracted from the interesting points of the piece. Susan's lack of sleep is touched upon multiple times, but doesn't really add anything to the plot. The stylish, chic look of the picture seems to be a calling card too, but does it enhance the proceedings? I'd say no.To me, then, ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a film that I really want to like, but also can't because there is just so much to unpack and digest. Even when I try to unpack everything, though, it doesn't seem worth the effort, as I never felt connected enough to the main players (likely because of all the distractions I've outlined above).So, a ""perfectly down the middle"" five-star review is the best I can give ""Nocturnal Animals"" as a complete film. I appreciate the inventive storytelling approach, but the whole thing just never came together for me.",Nocturnal Animals
47,Floated2,Deeply disturbed experience,7,20 January 2018,"Nocturnal Animals can be described as many things; a wrenching relationship drama, a nervy Texas crime narrative, a character study of a woman divorced from her soul and, not least, a brutal condemnation of the kind of dehumanization so celebrated among the ultra rich. Though it is most certainly not terribly satisfying in any of its manifestations. Director Ford has made a film of many beautiful layers, in part because not one of them is strong enough to stand on its own. Having little to no expectations, one did not fully know what the film was about and the trailers did make the film look interesting though misleading. Overall, this is a rare film in which is smart and makes the viewers keep guessing. The tone is consistent from the start and the performances from both Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal are great.",Nocturnal Animals
48,eddie_baggins,An ice cold and often enthralling slow burn,7,15 November 2016,"In 2009 fashion designer Tom Ford showed the world he was not your average fashionista with the stylish and moving A Single Man, a film that scored its star Colin Firth a well-deserved Oscar nomination and a film that showed Ford's keen eye as well as deft hand with his actors.In the 7 years since A Single Man's release it seemed as though we may never get to see Ford work his magic behind camera again but with his adaptation of Austin Wright's novel, Ford has once more announced himself to the filmmaking world, even though this ice cold thriller doesn't reach the heights of his searing debut.Beginning with what can only be described as a truly eye opening and depending on who you're watching with (maybe not a film to take your parents to) awkward credits sequence, Nocturnal Animals is a pitch black film with barely a moment for fun and games as Amy Adam's haunted by the past art gallery owner Susan Morrow finds old horrors brought up within her ex-husbands soon to be released novel that is kindly dedicated to her even though its blood filled story is anything but a glowing memorial to her.This two pronged narrative approach as Ford swings between Susan's present state that includes an unhappy marriage to Armie Hammer's much younger Hutton and her reading of this book that transports her to a world in which Jake Gyllenhaal's unfortunate Tony Hasting's deals with tragedy that leads him to a world in which Michael Shannon's deadpan detective Bobby Andes and Aaaron Taylor Johnson's sleazy plumber Ray Marcus inhabit, gives Ford a unique movie playground to work in but there's sadly little mystery or genuine unexpected payoffs to be found here despite the initial set up and Ford's calculatedly cold film leaves you feeling like an outsider to a world of rather unlikeable creations.Adam's is great as the self-centred Susan but she's not someone we grow to care for while Gyllenhaal's Tony is an initially rather weak protagonist who slowly becomes something more but the film finds its greatest creations within its darkest ones and Michael Shannon (playing a character that can only be described as Michael Shannon) and Johnson end up stealing a majority of the films best moments within a tale that will wash over you with its grimy undertones and seedy motivations.An impressive directional follow up by Ford, Nocturnal Animals is a tightly wound thriller that's well acted, brilliantly captured by Seamus McGarvey and moodily scored by Abel Korzeniowski and offers viewers a chance to escape into an often horrific world that would've benefited greatly by some extra showings of light and some characters we got to care for a little more, thus making this journey into darkness that much more memorable.3 ½ unusual exhibition openings out of 5",Nocturnal Animals
49,Red-125,"Very violent, although the violence is supposed to be part of a novel",7,19 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals (2016) was co-written and directed by Tom Ford.The film stars Amy Adams as Susan Morrow, a high-end art dealer, who is incredibly successful and wealthy. About 20 years ago, Susan divorced the man she loved, because she was dissatisfied with his career as a writer. Now, unhappily married to a man who is unfaithful to her, she is brought back into contact with her first husband. He has written a book, which he has dedicated to her, and sent to her in pre-publication proof.From that point on, the plot flips back and forth between Susan's ""real"" life, and the novel, as she reads it and envisions it in her mind. The ""novel"" is about a man and his family who are assaulted at night on a lonely road in Texas. The scenes of the novel are truly horrifying, because it looks like something that really could happen, and really could end the way it did.Adams does a fine job in her role. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as the husband in the novel. However, for me, acting honors go to Michael Shannon, as Bobby Andes, a detective in the novel for whom this will probably be his last case.Much has been made of the symbolism of the movie. Her first husband writes about a horrible assault on a family, and this is his way of paying her back for the way the way she left him all those years ago. Would someone really plan a revenge by writing a scary novel about revenge, and dedicating it to his ex-wife? Maybe, but it appears to me to be pretty trivial way of pointing out that now you are really a great novelist. ""I told you so,"" looks like a very modest revenge. The last scene is also about revenge, in a very childish way.Incidentally, this movie begins with a bizarre scene. Two overweight women are prancing around nude. Then we realize that they are on a video loop in a gallery. Then we realize that the two women, who were doing performance art (well, sort of) are part of the gallery exhibition. They are resting, immobile, on low-level platforms, still completely nude.(Yes, but is it art?)We saw this movie in the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Some of the rural Texas scenery will be lost on the small screen. However, other than that, it will work well on DVD.",Nocturnal Animals
50,leonblackwood,Could have been better! 5/10,5,24 September 2017,"Review: I was in two minds about this film because I found the Amy Adams scenes quite boring but the scenes played out from the book, were full of emotional drama. It also seemed liked a bit of a mess, because it goes back and forth from fact to fiction, and the two completely different story lines could have easily been two separate films. Anyway, the story is based on a married couple, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) and Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), who separate early on in the film, due to Susan having an affair with Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), who she ends up marrying. The film then skips 20 years in the future, we're Edward sends Susan a novel manuscript, ""Nocturnal Animals"", to get her opinion. The unhappy lamenting art curator, who feels unloved from her husband, delves into the book and soon feels emotional about the detailed content. The films then shows what Edward has written, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing a loving family man, Tony Hastings, whose married to Laura Hastings, and has a daughter called India. Whilst on vacation, they get pushed off the road by Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his gang, and whilst changing his wheel, the gang become violent, and they kidnap his wife and daughter. After getting ditched in the middle of nowhere, Tony finally finds his wife and daughter with detective Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon), who are murdered by the gang, in a violent way. When they finally track down the gang, Bobby gives Tony permission to take the law into his own hands but during a violent exchange, Edward is badly damaged. The movie then shows Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself. I must admit, this film does have the weirdest opening I have ever seen! Anyway, Jake Gyllenhaal was great as Tony Hastings, and Michael Shannon was a brilliant addition to the top cast but the flow of the movie was a bit strange. I can understand why Amy Adams played her role the way that she did but I still found her character quite depressing and boring. She used emotions more than dialogue throughout the movie, which were performed well but it was definitely the scenes from the book that made the movie interesting. Although I enjoyed half of the movie, I personally don't think that it was put together that well, and I was expecting a bit more after seeing the top cast. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by, the famous fashion designer, Tom Ford, 56, who gained fame as the creative director of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and he launched his own Tom Ford label in 2006. He also directed a Single Man in 2009, starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, which was Oscar nominated, along with this film, so his 2 movies have been quite successful, even though it's not his main passion. He also wrote and produced both movies, so he really gave them his all, which paid off. In a lot of ways, this is a unique movie which touches on a delicate subject matter, which must have been a challenge to direct, so I have to commend him for taking on such a deep project. Budget: $22.5million Worldwide Gross: $30.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/romance/dramas, starring Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron- Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Laura Linney, Michael Sheen, Ellie Bamber and Armie Hammer. 5/10",Nocturnal Animals
51,howard.schumann,Gets under your skin,8,11 December 2016,"Based on the 1993 novel ""Tony and Susan"" by Austin Wright, Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals is a gorgeous looking film that has style by the bucketful. The images that open the film provide an immediate sense of its flamboyant style and also its interpretative quagmire. Obese women, naked except for an outfit consisting of little more than sparklers and confetti, dance in slow motion to introduce the opening of a new video installation by Los Angeles art gallery owner Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). While Susan labels the art ""junk,"" it soon becomes clear that without it, her elite lifestyle, characterized by Ford as shallow and charmless, would be in jeopardy given that her second husband Hutton's (Armie Hammer) business is floundering.The fact that their marriage is also in trouble because of his philandering suggests that Susan's choice of looking good over being true to herself did not work out too well and has left her childless, dispirited and unable to sleep. One day she receives a package from her first husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) containing his unpublished novel titled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" a book that is dedicated to Susan and bears the same title as that of a snarky nickname he gave her many years ago. The receipt of the book only serves to remind her of the man she rejected nineteen years ago as being a weak and ineffective provider, something her mother (Laura Linney) could have told her before she got married and in fact did.The novel, that might be interpreted as depicting the disconnect between the elite world of culture and the down and dirty folks in the hinterland becomes a film within a film. The novel turns out to be an ultra-violent story of revenge that occupies most of the remainder of the movie except for flashes between the reality of Susan's life and the book's narrative. In the book, Tony Hastings (also played by Gyllenhaal), decides to drive all night on a lonely desert road in the Texas panhandle with his wife Laura performed by Amy Adams lookalike Isla Fisher and their daughter India (Elle Bamber). The dark aspects of the story begin to emerge as their car is forced off the road by three local good ol' boy stereotypes led by Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).Terrorized by the lowlifes who alternate kindness with brutality as do all good psychopaths, the husband is abandoned on a desert road while his wife and daughter meet a grisly fate. Their bodies are discovered by the retiring detective assigned to the case, the cowboy-hatted Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) whose laid back West Texas charm reveals the most vividly drawn character in the film. When the thugs are located and cornered, the Texas lawman, who is dying of lung cancer and has nothing left to lose, abandons the oath he took to uphold law and order and invites Tony to help him administer instant justice, one the macho-challenged Tony cannot refuse.The novel, nineteen years in the making, leaves Susan recoiling in horror as she remembers her beginnings as an artist and the values she turned her back on, and speculates whether Edward may be thinking of something other than artistic criticism. Written and directed by Ford, a famous fashion designer whose 2009 film A Single Man received much critical acclaim, Nocturnal Animals gets under your skin and is hard to shake.

Quite the opposite.,8,16 November 2016,"A film hotly tipped for Academy Awards, Nocturnal Animals is about an art gallery director receiving a novel from her ex-husband and as she reads it she starts to realise the true intentions of the book. Now I went into this knowing nothing, I only watched the trailer once and thought the cast was good enough to warrant a viewing. Little did I know I was about to watch a truly depressing film...but in the good sense. As always, with a cast like this you are going to get outstanding performances. Jake Gyllenhaal once again adds a ridiculously powerful performance to his canon, Amy Adams was understated and full of emotion. But for me, the surprise was Aaron Taylor-Johnson. No longer do we have the bland acting from Kick-Ass and Avengers: Age of Ultron, we now have ourselves a real actor and the greatest compliment I can give to all three is that they deserve awards. Michael Shannon is consistent as always and the small roles played by Andrea Riseborough (supremely underrated) and Laura Linney are all very good. Director Tom Ford took this film and owned it, it reeked of confident direction. Bold static landscape shots, shaky frantic camera work and even the clear contrast between the three narratives...it just reminded me of the old neo-noir films. Speaking of the narratives, the film follows three plots which are all interlinked but the editing is made to switch between them throughout the runtime. Whilst this was required, I felt the constant switching was disjointed and pulled me away from the movie at times. The transitions could've been more natural instead of being forced. When I say this film was depressing, I'm not exaggerating. There is no sign of happiness in this, not even remotely and I would love to talk about scenes in detail but unfortunately that will ruin the story (so I may need to do a more detailed review in the future). I mean the allegory that the novel creates is just genius, I've not seen fitting symbolism in a film like this in ages. The score behind the film was also great, it added to the drama and the intensity of the performances on screen. I do have to mention the introductory scene, the scariest thing ever and unfortunately the imagery I witnessed will be embedded in my mind forever (...urgh). Overall, Nocturnal Animals was a harrowingly depressing film with outstanding performances all-round even if the film's narrative felt disjointed.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Nocturnal Animals
53,matthewssilverhammer,Huh...I DO always get Isla Fisher & Amy Adams Mixed Up...,8,16 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals opens with a montage of overweight women dancing naked in slo-mo. It's certainly not something you see everyday, and sets the tone for a movie that always feels like it has something sinister hiding beneath its skin. Like a more naturalistic Mulholland Drive, it's a Lynchian mystery about the effects of fiction on our lives, in which nothing would be strange enough to be out of the realm of possibility. It's admittedly opaque and borderline pretentious, yet still it's difficult not to be completely sucked in by the painful artistry and baffling intrigue on display. It's basically two movies: one follows Adams character as she navigates the high-society art world, and the other exists within a violent novel she is reading written by her ex-husband (Gyllenhaal). The real world is glossy and full of restrained rich-people and their problems. The book is grimy, tense and infuriating, an intentionally melo-dramatic and overacted murder-tale that is scary & unbelievably engaging. Other than Gyllenhaal, who I think struggles with the tonal balance, the performances are largely very good, with Taylor-Johnson and Shannon standing out. Each gives a bold turns within the novel universe outside of how we normally see from them. Director Ford takes a sharp approach to the film, especially the editing. Never sign-posting the transitions between the two worlds, he combines the southern-Gothic thrills & supremely dark psychology, effectively put off our guard as the veil we keep between the realms of reality and fiction thins. It's an unwieldy tale, to be sure, and I'm curious to see if my love for it sustains. Either way, it's a pulpy, surrealist anomaly that is more than worth the look.",Nocturnal Animals

The second element follows the actual manuscript, called ""Nocturnal Animals,"" which revolves around a man whose family vacation turns violent and deadly. It also continues to follow the story of Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself.Amy Adams should be bagging at the local grocery store. She cannot act. She instantly brings the movie down. The film is poorly constructed and dumb. The dialog is idiotic. How this movie gets over a 7 review rating is beyond me.Watching this confusing poorly constructed fiasco is a complete waste of time.",Nocturnal Animals
55,paul-allaer,"Really wanted to like it, but I couldn't",7,13 December 2016,"""Nocturnal Animals"" (2015 release; 116 min.) brings the story of of Susan and Edward. As the movie opens, we are at the opening of Susan's latest showing at her art gallery. Susan returns home, and there she receives a package from her ex with an advance copy of his new novel called ""Nocturnal Animals"". After her husband, with whom she seems to have a strained relationship, is off again to New York on business (?), Susan starts reading the manuscript, and then then movie switches to the novel. There, we get to know fictitious Tony (based on Edward) and Susan and their teenage daughter as they are on a long stretch of abandoned road in Western Texas, where trouble is brewing... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie from writer/producer/director Tom Ford, after his more than promising debut ""A Single Man"" a few years ago. Here he brings the novel ""Tony and Susan"" (by Austin Wright) to the big screen. Not surprisingly, Ford does it in a very stylish way. I must admit that I was taken aback by the montage over the opening credits (starring fully nude and grossly overweight strippers--does someone know what the point of that was?). Afterwards, the movie becomes a complex psychological thriller that plays out in not one, not two, but three paths: the present, the novel, and the flashbacks. The art gallery scenes, combined with the music, somehow made me think back of Brian De Palma's ""Dressed to Kill"" from 30+ years ago. The West Texas crime scenes made me think of the other recent West Texas-based crime movie ""Hell or High Water"" (one of my favorite movies of the year). Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal are fine in the lead roles of Susan and Edward/Tony, but for my money, the movie is stolen by Aaron Taylor-Johnson as super-meanie Ray and to a lesser degree Michael Shannon as the local cop. A special tip o' the old hat for music composer Abel Korzeniowski, who also scored ""A Single Man"" and who brings one of the better movie scores of the year, in my book. ""Nocturnal Animals"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me, and while it certainly wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, neither did it come anywhere close to meeting my expectations. It was okay, but not great, but I fully realize this is a subjective view and many others may disagree (I'll take ""Hell or High Water"" any time over this).""Nocturnal Animals"" has been gradually getting a wider release over the last 4-5 weeks, and the movie finally opened here in Cincinnati this weekend. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. It will remain to be seen if the movie can survive the onslaught of new releases coming out in the next 2 weeks. If you liked Tom Ford's ""A Single Man"", you should definitely gives this a try. I can't help but feel a bit disappointed, given all the buzz that has surrounded this.",Nocturnal Animals
56,subxerogravity,What an awesome movie!!,8,21 November 2016,"It's very, very impressive to watch. It's a great story and story within a story. There were three stories intertwining: Amy Adams plays Susan whose ex-husband sends her a manuscript of his latest novel Nocturnal animals (a nick name he gave her once). The book is about a man traveling down the road with his wife and daughter who get come across the worse type of trouble. Another story takes place in the past where Susan reminiscences about the relationship of her and her ex-husband.Director Tom Ford did a wonderful job mixing these three stories together to tell a tale that for me was about getting hurt in the worse possible way by the one you love the most and then getting revenge on that person, in the best possible way. At least that's the awesome message I got from the film, I'm sure there were others.The acting in this was stunning. From the big guns like Jake Gyllenhaal who played the ex-husband, Edward and also doubles as Tony, the main character in Edward's book. This was a far better acting performance then he did in Nightcrawler and they wanted to give him an Oscar for that. Then they're smaller roles like the one given to Isla Fisher who played Laura, Tony's wife. Who I think was perfectly cast because of her resemblance to Amy Adams that helps hit you over the head with the metaphor this movie is clearly vibing.What can I say about Micheal Shannon that's not already been said? This guy (quietly) sparks magic onto the screen as a Texas Sheriff who is a part of Edward's book. The movie also looks and feels pretty, with very elegant settings, and music, that really puts you into the emotional state all the characters go through. And it's that too, very emotional. The performances of all the actors were so good that you can attach yourself to one in order to really get into it. Nocturnal Animals is an entertaining Drama from beginning to end.",Nocturnal Animals
57,jtindahouse,You never find art-films this entertaining,8,10 November 2016,"I almost never enjoy art-films as much as I enjoyed 'Nocturnal Animals'. Is it really an art film though, you may ask? I think at its heart it is. It could be quite deceiving because there is decidedly more action and violence than you average film that would be classified in that genre. Still though, all the ingredients that make up an art-film are there. It's a very smart film. It never insults its audience, instead treating us to wonderful symmetry and metaphors, all of which are simple enough to grasp, yet complicated enough to appreciate. The start of the movie caught me off guard. Without giving anything away - it's quite visually attention grabbing. Then the story kicks off. It starts slow, and then a plot piece is introduced, and from there it never looks back. The cutaways to Amy Adam's character are really the only time things slow down, but even those scenes I found captivating. Then to cap it all the off the ending is perfectly written and filmed. There were a number of ways they could have gone to end this one, but I think they picked the best option. It gives everything that has happened in the film up to that point purpose and meaning.The acting is uncommonly strong from the entire cast. Jake Gyllenhaal is fast becoming one of the surest signs of quality in Hollywood. Every film he appears in lately I absolutely love. I can't imagine an Oscar is too far away for him, but sadly I don't think he will find it for 'Nocturnal Animals'. Amy Adams is also terrific, however the real stand-out for me was Michael Shannon. I'm not always his biggest fan, but here he was perfectly suited to the role and absolutely nailed it. This is a very fine film. The two hour run time absolutely flies by, and there's plenty of thinking and appreciating to do long after the credits roll.",Nocturnal Animals
58,BeneCumb,"Okay due to good performances, but often protracted and over-sophisticated",7,1 November 2017,"I tend to like Tom Ford's A Single Man. I was not enraptured, but the leading performers were versatile and great, and so I did not mind to follow his second film. Perhaps I wanted some development regarding tautness, excitement - but, alas, I did not find. Again, the performers are good, if not great (particularly Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon), and parallel worlds enable witty and smooth comparisons and similar activities in different time and space, but striving for profundity and artisticness has brought along long static scenes and elements difficult to follow, to be read in the plot description later on. The novel is not too interesting as a thriller, and the real world is rather boring, forcing me to use forward-function from time to time... No, I am not into flashing lights and action chases, but seeing a static face for dozens of seconds without any event in the background - not for me either.Thus, I got ambivalent feelings, and I do not share the overall praise. Yes, direction is witty, characters distinct, but the two worlds do not form a smooth entirety.",Nocturnal Animals
59,jadavix,Crime thriller with a difference,6,23 January 2017,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is a crime-thriller with a difference. The crime-thriller aspect is a story within a story, or in this case, a novel within a movie. Amy Adams plays a rich executive, whose ex- husband, Edward, gives her a book he has written. We see the novel acted out on screen as Adams' character reads it.In the scenes which depict the book's story, which make up the majority of the run-time, Gyllenhaal also plays the protagonist. He is driving through West Texas with his wife and daughter when he is run off the road by a group of sinister rednecks. They take the wife and daughter and leave Tony for dead. Later, Gyllenhaal's Tony encounters Michael Shannon as the lawman, a man with reasons of his own for being loose with the law.In the moments of heightened tension within this story, Adams' character quits reading and we are reminded that this is just a story-within-a-story. The frame isn't as interesting, however. Adams is now in a loveless marriage with a personality-less hunk, having ditched Gyllenhaal's Edward. Scenes from their relationship are played back to us, where we see that Edward was a true romantic, and Adams, a pragmatist. It is clear that their relationship wasn't going to work: they're simply too different.The filmmakers have made what appears to be a wise choice in having the movie's two plot lines play off each other: the framing story is suggestive and reserved, the story-within is violent and explosive. When Adams stops reading the book because it's getting too heavy, however, we're not feeling the same way. This inner story isn't as intense as it should be, and the story that frames it isn't as interesting. It's hard to feel much for Adams' character, aside from empathy with her reactions to the novel. At least that we can understand, even if we don't feel it as much as she seems to.A movie like this needs to make a stronger emotional impression in both its plot lines. We don't feel much for Adams' failed marriage because they never seemed to fit together anyway, and we don't see much of how she feels in her current picture perfect relationship, or if she really even regrets the way things turned out with Edward, or thought they could end any other way. Tony's story is a bit familiar. How many times have we seen the nice-guy-pushed-to-the- edge story, or the lawman willing to look the other way because he also hates the perpetrators?This plot line should have played more like pulp fiction to play off the seriousness of the framing story. But, I fear, the filmmakers didn't realise this material would work better that way: they take it too seriously, so we're left with two stories, one boring, the other familiar, neither particularly effective.",Nocturnal Animals

Edgar.This is a violent thriller that is directed by Tom Ford, a fashion designer that has an eye for cinema-this is his second film, the first being 'A Single Man'. The opening credits has several obese women dancing and Oh Yeah, they are nude. You soon discover that it is an art display put on by Amy. I read that it was supposed to be some kind of a statement about obesity in the American culture. Anyway, Amy is married to Armie but theirs is not a good marriage. Amy was married 20 years earlier to Jake but they separated on bad terms. Out of the blue, Amy receives a manuscript in the mail of a book from Jake that he wants her to read before he has it published. The movie goes into a second story as Amy is reading the book and it tells the story of a family that is on a vacation when they run into trouble-they jump back and forth between the two stories throughout the rest of the film. Jake plays the man in the book's story and Isla plays his wife. FYI: Isla looks an awful lot like Amy. I won't go into too much detail about what happens in the book but it involves terror, rape, murder and revenge. Michael plays the policeman that is assigned to Jake. There is symbolism all through the film, in both stories. I'm not a big fan of symbolism-I would rather they just come right out and said things straightforward-because I'm sure I miss some of the meanings but I did get at least some of it, I think. Even the ending leaves it up to the viewers' interpretation-I think I figured it out but I could be wrong.

61,meeza,Instant Nocterpiece!!,10,5 January 2017,"The Ford Administration has delivered! Fashion icon turned filmmaker Tom Ford has fashioned an intoxicating, gripping thriller ""Nocturnal Animals"". This is unlike any movie you will see on the runway in 2016. It stars as Amy Adams as Art Gallery Owner Susan Morrow. Susan is married to adulterous husband Hutton played by Armie Hammer. Even though the Morrows live a wealth life, Susan's art gallery is having fiscal nightmares. A novel is sent to Susan entitled ""Nocturnal Animals""; written by her ex- husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) which she has not seen in nearly twenty years. Susan starts reading the novel, of course during the nocturnal time periods, and then the film incorporates the narrative of the novel within the intertwining stories structure of the picture; which revolves around a family of three's encounter with psychotic hoodlums. The film also shows flashback scenes of Edward and Susan's past relationship. I do not want to Noc you out with more plot details, because that would be an exercise in spoiler fatality. I do have to say that ""Nocturnal Animals"" is almost like three movies in one. Moreover, the various narratives within the picture invokes the viewers to put in their own symbolic interpretations and relationship analysis due to the profound ambiguity of the movie. Ford's direction and screenplay were phenomenal and much deserving of Oscar nominations. The cast was spectacular. Adams perfected the role of Susan. Gyllenhaal's double duty performance as Sheffield and the novel's main character Tony was a compound sensation. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was mad impressive as the novel's main sociopath antagonist Ray Marcus. Laura Linney just went to bat one time by being in just one scene, but knocked it out of the ball park as Susan's judgmental mother Anne. But what will really noc your socks out is Michael Shannon's pure-perfect performance as the dying investigative detective Bobby Andes. Andesleeee!! Give Shannon a Best Supporting Actor Oscar!!

62,parry_na,"A little long, but you wouldn't want to miss a second.",9,28 August 2020,"Described as 'neo-noir', Nocturnal Animals is one of those films that's 'bigger' than us. That is, it is a production so meticulously put together, and exploring so deeply its own narrative, it isn't even satisfied to tell only one story: it tells three.It requires concentration to notice what is being told in present time, in flashback, and also the long moments taken from the book written by the character of Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) - these moments, it should be noted, are from the perspective of ex-wife Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). If any confusion does arise from this, it all clears up as time goes on, and the beautiful cinematic flourishes (Director and Producer Tom Ford has a reputation for rewarding those who watch closely) are a wonderful diversion.By being 'bigger' than us, I mean that every level of 'Nocturnal Animals' features people at the top of their game, from the utterly brilliant actors to the extraordinary production values, to Abel Korzeniowski's heart-rending musical score. By being 'bigger' than us, it doesn't even have to bother with closure for some of its characters - by the heart-breaking close, which is too open-ended for some, you wonder what happens to some of the characters you've become so heavily invested in.

This is a movie that is woven together by two different plains; one real and one fictions. The plot is based around a fiction novel author who is in an unhappy marriage and once divorced while she attempts to write a thriller. The real plot, injected into the fictional plot, is the woman's emotional state around her relationship with both men (current and past husband) and her unresolved feelings. She is often somber and unhappy. The majority of the movie is the thriller story playing out where a family of three have a threatening encounter on the highway with three other local hoodlums, who later kidnap his wife and teenage daughter. How the stories play off of each other is important to figure out yet is very vague and cold due to the unsympathetic characters.

The movie turns into a story-within-a-story as she reads the manuscript, and it shifts between her life and the manuscript's plot.The second husband turns out to be a bit of a jerk, and the story about her life focuses on the flashbacks with her first husband, her art gallery, and her current life.

However, when Susan receives a draft copy of her ex-husband's latest novel she finds that she's unable to put the book down and finds it slowly consuming her life...Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals is a rather challenging film to bring to the screen; in less than 2 hours he's trying to meld fantasy,fiction and reality as well as developing a decent backstory for ex-husband and ex-wife in order for the audience to make an emotional connection. He mostly keeps the film on track and the challenge for the audience is trying to decipher what we're really seeing and what is playing out in Susan's mind. What really makes this work is that the story within the story is actually pretty compelling; although it is Ed's novel, what unfolds on screen is clearly Susan's interpretation of the material - it's clear that she feels a lot of guilt and pain for the way she has treated Ed which is perhaps why her vision of the novel sees him go through so much pain. The kidnapping sequence at the start is quite menacing (much of this is helped by a creepy and rather disturbing performance by Aaron Taylor-Johnson). After the event, Hastings ends up forming an unlikely alliance with sheriff Bobby Anders (Michael Shannon) who decides that he will take matters into his own hands when one of the gang is acquitted - he doesn't care as he has cancer and only has a year to live. I enjoyed the story within the story being played out on the screen, but sadly some of the 'real' world stuff in this film wasn't quite as interesting. The scenes between Susan and current hubby Hutton (Armie Hammer) don't seem to add much to the story - I get why he's in the film even though he exists as little more than a metaphor for infidelity. He may as well be wearing a T-Shirt saying 'The Grass isn't always greener.' I'm pretty sure the effect would have been the same if Susan was a single woman filled with regret rather than a married woman filled with regret and didn't appreciate the way that Hutton seemed to get forced in and out of the story whenever it seemed necessary. Some may also see the film as being a bit artsy-fartsy and if I'm totally honest I did feel that way to about this film at times. On balance though, there is definitely more right than wrong here and Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals will probably be a film that people will talk about and is a film that certainly lingered in my mind.",Nocturnal Animals

69,drownnnsoda,The death of a marriage told as a down-home psychothriller,9,20 November 2016,"A wealthy, accomplished (yet depressive, borderline-catatonic) art curator in Los Angeles receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's novel, which he has ominously dedicated to her. Over the following days, she becomes absorbed by the narrative, which tells the story of a violent kidnapping and murder in rural Texas, followed by a subsequent revenge plot. Adapted from a novel by Austin Wright, ""Nocturnal Animals"" seems on a surface level to be something of a one-trick pony in that its most unique attribute is its narrative-within-a-narrative structure. When the two are parsed out and examined side-by-side, the film appears rather skeletal, but combined, they achieve a unique symbiosis. What is fascinating is that the experience of reading and imagination is represented in such a way that I've never seen before on film. The greater narrative has Susan lounging around her slick L.A. mansion reading the manuscript, and the film shifts back and forth between her subjective world and the world of the novel; at times she snaps back into reality by external forces, or simply because she is too disturbed by what she is reading and has to put the book down. At other times, it triggers memories of her marriage (which manifest alongside the novel scenes) that slowly build a chronology of it from its youthful beginning to its tragic end. If these diegetic maneuvers sound convoluted or even pretentious, they really aren't. The film, for all of its shifting, is easy to follow; it's the dual-narrative that provides real texture to the picture.Tom Ford, needless to say, is a man of aesthetics, and he has the same preoccupations as a filmmaker, which he established with the melancholy and meditative ""A Single Man"" in 2009. ""Nocturnal Animals"" is not quite as lush is as his debut—it's much colder, and elementally much grittier; it's also, by virtue of the inner-narrative, a hard-edged thriller, whereas ""A Single Man"" was a pure tragic drama. Nonetheless, ""Nocturnal Animals"" is beautifully shot. The greater narrative adopts a classic California neo-noir aesthetic (think ""The Informers,"" or ""Mulholland Dr.""), while the inner-narrative has the grit and grime of a down-home murder story (some shots of the countryside are reminiscent of Terrance Malick). The contrast between the two is extreme, but each of the worlds are richly realized and absorbing for vastly different reasons. Ford also seems to be evoking his own Texas roots here by altering setting of the inner-narrative from Maine, as it is in Wright's novel, to west Texas.The cast here is a major pull. Amy Adams, for as little as she has to do physically (aside from her flashback scenes, she spends the majority of the film alone in only a handful of contexts), she does a serious amount of emotional work, all of which is channeled through her eyes. It's an understated but dynamic performance. Gyllenhaal has the privilege (and I suppose responsibility) of a dual role, playing the lead of the novel as well as Adams' ex-husband, and he turns in solid performances in both. Michael Shannon is also memorable as the idiosyncratic detective in the novel narrative, while Aaron Taylor-Johnson hits notes flawlessly as the amoral trailer trash antagonist. The film is peppered with performances from other various well-known actors in small parts; Isla Fisher appears in an unusually serious part and is fantastic, while Laura Linney has one key scene as Adams' overbearing southern mother. Jena Malone also has a bit part as one of Adams' art colleagues.Overall, I was very taken by ""Nocturnal Animals"" for various reasons I've stated above. After the film was over, I initially felt as though I had wanted more out of the overarching narrative with Adams, as her present interiority does seem sparse in its realization, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that that was the point. The film is largely about memory, imagination, and understanding the past. Adams' character doesn't seem to know why she is the way she is anymore than the audience does, and it is the inner-narrative —""Nocturnal Animals""— that becomes a surrogate for the story of what has brought her to such an anesthetized, empty state. 9/10.",Nocturnal Animals

71,davispittman,Interesting metaphorically based story,8,14 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals (2016), based on the novel of the same name, is a very fascinating story. It's one of deep rooted pain and regret by it's main character. The cast does a wonderful job at portraying their characters with realness and not holding back at all. Amy Adams gives a very melancholy performance, since her character is so damaged and woefully unhappy with the current state of her life. Jake Gylanhaal, who plays two very different characters in the film does a great job at nailing both of them and mastering their different personalities, how they behave, talk, and what they're all about. I really do praise Gylanhaal's performance here and I personally believe that he should have received an academy award nomination for this, he goes from being easy going and calm to very unhinged and almost out of his mind, given the circumstances he's in later in the movie. Michael Shannon did a very good job at playing this unorthodox police man, and I commend his performance, but I think that Gylanhaal outshines everyone in this movie as far as acting goes. The writing and dialogue in the film is riveting and very interesting, it reveals a lot about the individual characters. I really like the way the film was set up and how the metaphor set up by the novel affected Susan, the filmmakers handled that aspect very well. The ending was done well too, leaves you contemplating the whole movie and what happened and ultimately how it affected the main characters. 8/10. Oh and if nudity freaks you out, then watch out for the first 3 minutes.",Nocturnal Animals

74,aharmas,Action and Reaction,10,24 November 2016,"Tom Ford's second film is a masterpiece of sorts. When he gave us ""A Single Man"", he combined drama with aesthetics. This time, he raises the bar for himself, with a cinematic work of art, full of intensity, magical imagery, and with enough suspense to stop a weak heart. It's hard to define what the piece is. It's a mix of something that could have been put together by Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Lynch, or all of them together. It's a very interesting, satisfying, and demanding motion picture.The opening scene will have you talking for a while. It's beautiful and grotesque at the same time, and it hints at what is coming since it shows what a seemingly normal artist can do, the extremes she's willing to go to catch the public's attention. This is a motif that repeats and grows darker as the film progresses. To begin, everyone seems pretty unsatisfied with their present situations. It's both clear and confusing, and much of it depends on what each person really wants or thinks he/she wants or needs.Our protagonist (Adams) confirms what she has known for a while: that her relationship with her husband might be about to collapse. In fact, it appears to it is heading that way. She receives a package which has a novel written by her first husband. A note tells that it is very different from anything he has done before, and she is very curious about its contents. As she reads, the film goes back and forth in time and provides the necessary background to understand why she wants to read it. During this journey we discover how she became intimate with her husband, how their relationship develop, and how others appeared to be aware of what was happening and would eventually happen.We have three story lines flowing simultaneously: the past, the present, and the contents of the book. We realize how the main characters from the book are based on real life people. What the audience and the protagonist are not not able to comprehend is the level of viciousness that exists at the core of the novel. It is disconcerting when we realize that everything is based on something or someone real because everyone knows that ""people only write about themselves or what they know really well."" There's very little beauty here beyond the visuals and art direction. Evil and ugliness are the soul of the film. People hate each other, take advantage of each other, violate each other both physically and mentally, and even when they seem the best intentions, the delivery is dark and full of venom. One of the most chilling scenes has a mother dispensing advice to her daughter, and the feeling of realizing that there's only truth being said is devastating to the daughter and us. Laura Linney is simply spectacular here, an actress being of both able to show kindness and darkness whenever the project requires it.In the book a family is completely shattered by their encounter with a trio of hoods. Their lives will never be the same, and every single moment grows darker and darker until its terrifying conclusion. Not much better is the resolution of the contemporary story which has one of the simplest but most devastating emotional effects in cinema. We know the ending would be a sad one, and it all originates in the past, working its way to the end of the film, just like domino chain would work.""Nocturnal Animals"" earn every bit of praise with its creativity, its structure, its strong plot, and the work an ensemble that will be studied for many years to come. Stand outs are Gyllenthal and Taylor-Johnson, two sides of the same coin, or maybe two human beings who embody opposite qualities. Is the night a world of darkness, a setting for the worst, or a metaphor for the soul, whatever it might be, the effect is clear here where one can't help watching at the beauty and the darkness that are apparently able to co-exist, one depending on the other to survive.***** out *****",Nocturnal Animals
75,aidanratesmovies,"""Believe me, our world is a lot less painful than the real world.""",9,3 January 2021,"Nocturnal Animals is able to present itself as a total unique viewing of masterful storytelling, containing fantastic performances, but leading to a rather satisfying conclusion. I was looking forward to watching this film for quite a while now, and I have to say, after watching it, it is nothing like I expected it to be. The film does a surprisingly decent job at balancing the three stories at hand, that being the present events in Adam's characters life, the past events, and the story her ex-husband wrote for her. Without a doubt the best parts of the movie involve the story at hand throughout the film, parts lead largely by a fantastic-as-ever Jake Gyllenhaal and the underrated Michael Shannon. Aaron Taylor-Johnson also provides an excellent although downright despicable performance as Ray Marcus, as well as Amy Adams who also does her best in her often solemn-filled role. The film can be a bit hard to follow at times, lacking a true point in the end for the audience, and building up to something that clearly was never there. My biggest part of the film was the ending, not because it was bad, but just because it felt unfinished. I get what director Tom Ford was going for, but it just doesn't feel right given the context of things at hand, and I wish there was a more forthright conclusion in at least some way for the audience and myself to enjoy. The film is never predictable, but it does have a few cliche character moments throughout, although Ford's script manages to give a greater depth to this and largely is able to overcome its more generic flaws. In the end, Nocturnal Animals isn't what I expected it to be, but it is a very well done thriller with issues, but never enough to disappoint too much.
My Rating: 8.6/10",Nocturnal Animals
76,dierregi,A strikingly beautiful movie full of emptiness,5,4 June 2017,"Hyper privileged 40-something Susan has an enviable job, a huge villa on the hills, an unfaithful - albeit polite and charming - husband and and ex-husband, who out of the blue sends her the manuscript of his book.Ex-hubby Edward resentfully avoided contact with Susan for 19 years but suddenly he decides he wants her opinion about his book. This seems fishy, but Susan is delighted - maybe because her marriage is on the rocks and she feels nostalgic about Edward...Major problem here: how did Edward know about Susan's situation? They were not in contact for 19 years after a brutal break-up but somehow he guessed that Susan's life has reached luxurious rock-bottom: failed marriage, dissatisfaction with the job, boredom all round, despite the lavish lifestyle.Anyway, the ""movie within the movie"" starts with Susan reading the novel, a violent story more interesting than the ""real"" one.The novel should be interpreted as Edward's revenge. He wants to upset Susan by metaphorically eliminating her in a brutal way. However, Edward comes out as mean and weak for carrying a grudge for all those years. Susan gets plenty of time to regret her decisions, but she cannot change the past.As to be expected the photography, costumes and sets are chilling beautiful - ""chilling""being the key word. The brutal ""fictional"" story is gripping, although silly in parts, the ""conversation before killing someone"" cliché being the silliest, but the point of the whole movie seems to be that rich people can also be unhappy.That may be so, but as it was stated many times, it is better to cry in a Roll Royce coming back from the most expensive restaurant in town, rather than in a cardboard box under a bridge.",Nocturnal Animals

78,AudioFileZ,Surreal Unrequited Love Tragedy,6,24 December 2016,"Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals is expectedly stylish, but it's also like a complex painting because he challenges the viewer to tie the multiple time lines and their stories together - in other words your interpretation may be as different as art is in various beholder's eyes. The movie is a story about unrequited love and how in a bleak world where pain and sorrow is often an unfortunate decision away just how great that love loss can be. Suffering is multiplied by loneliness and maybe a bit of revenge.The film wouldn't be nearly as unique if it were told straight, nor would it be as effective if the central characters weren't as hauntingly tragic as portrayed by Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. The fact is the layering makes for some head-scratching that really draws the viewer inward. It almost demands repeated viewing as such. Quite unsettling and thought provoking while feeling refreshingly original. Worth a look, just don't expect to be entertained as that is not what this is about.",Nocturnal Animals

I mean, you're already making a rated R movie about the worst of humanity, why hold back? The underlining story is good but the resulting film doesn't take it to the next level, what a shame. I guess this movie is okay at best, it was just in need of a few gut punches and because of that, it will not be remembered 10 years from now by most. Yeah, this movie is hugely overrated.",Nocturnal Animals
80,jadepietro,Tales from the Dark Side,9,17 December 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: In only his second film, Tom Ford makes a provocative and disturbing film that confirms his status as a director to watch.GRADE: B+ SYNOPSIS: Three parallel stories converge as an indictment of our human failings.JIM'S REVIEW: Nocturnal Animals is a study of contrasts, from its intense color palette, beautifully staged to its ensemble of characters and plots. Fiction collides with reality as Tom Ford's screenplay and skillful direction layers its multiple stories (that somehow are expected to relate to the characters' past lives and actually do). The three-in-one parallel story-line can seem, at times, a tad ambiguous and never tying up all the loose ends of the narrative. But they intertwined repeatedly to relate the story of a failed marriage and Mr. Ford handles the complex story threads astutely.One knows from the unsettling opening credits that this film wants to be a disturbing indictment of America's class divide as it literally shows the dark underbelly of our culture with its greed, violence, art, and materialism on full display, especially for David Lynch, John Waters, and Diane Arbus aficionados.Edward's novel becomes the catalyst to the present day goings-on of his former spouse, Susan, a rich but shallow socialite caught in a loveless marriage. Once in love with him, Susan chose the material world and all of its glitz and glamour over a simpler and more honest life style. Now she owns a gallery and has married a wealthy playboy who has not much in common with her except the nouveau riche world of cocktail parties, gossip, and fashion essentials. The story-within-a-story is Edward's novel. His manuscript, dedicated and sent to Susan, becomes a must-read for his ex-wife and the film fluidly connects her reactions to his story while retelling his soon-to-be published novel. His written prose tells the violent tale of a family taken hostage by psychotic low-lifes. Is it a true story, an allegory, or a means of revenge by the author toward his first love?We also are given glimpses of Edward and Susan's courtship and marriage to sharply contrast the road they had both taken. One wishes more background story were shown as well to show more f the heartbreak.As writer and director, Mr. Ford does seem to bite the hand that fed him in his other career, but it seems he knows his subject all too well and is unabashed in exposing the ugly truth about the elite few. His direction is concise and the story-within-a-story portion of the film is brimming with tension while his other narratives create a revealing sad and disillusioned world. He keeps the melodramatic aspects of the plot in check.Based on a novel by Austin Wright, Nocturnal Animals basks in its own hyper-cynicism and tends to overstate the obvious. But it does so with the director's clear vision and compelling narrative. The film is gorgeous to see. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is stunning with its stark imagery and the production design and costumes reinforce the characters' milieu so well. Kudos also to Joan Sobel's seamless editing which controlled the multiple story arcs beautifully and Abel Korzeniowski's atmospheric music score.The film is even more powerful due to the accomplished acting of its fine cast. Amy Adams once again adds to her impressive resume as Susan. It is a difficult role to play as her character is not the most endearing person. Yet she layers this introspective self-absorbed woman with such nuanced reactions and her restraint not to overact makes her character all the more real. She is astonishing. Jake Gyllenhaal as Edward and his fictional counterpart, Tony is equally strong. His is the more showier and dramatic role in all three stories and the actor is highly effective and totally believable in his dual roles.The supporting cast help to make this film one of the best ensembles this year. Excellent acting is delivered by Michael Shannon, Amie Hammer, and in a small but memorable part, Laura Linney as Susan's mother is superb. Aaron Taylor-Johnson encapsulates evil as the Texas madman and he makes this stock character all the more menacing with his mercurial acting choices.The biggest flaw with this well made film is Mr. Ford's continuing perpetuation of stereotypes in his script: shallow and unhappy narcissists living the good life, Deliverance-style Texas rednecks who enjoy terrorizing the helpless, the dreamer who wants to write The Great American novel, the selfish unhappily married rich but successful female executive, the handsome philandering husband, the snobbish Waspish mother. All are present and accounted for.Complex and always engrossing, Nocturnal Animals is a delicate balance of style and substance. While one story strand may prove more involving in its non-linear structure to the others, all of the tales do compliment each other. The sum of the parts make the whole film work convincingly. It's mostly because of Mr. Ford's sleight-of-hand that masterfully move the stories along to an ending that may satisfy some and mystify others. I relished the film's artistry and message. One may not love this disturbing film but one cannot deny its impact and thought-provoking observations. The talented Mr. Ford has crafted a very good film about the very bad.NOTE: Previously, I said that Manchester by the Sea was the feel-bad movie of the year due to its depressing subject. Well, Nocturnal Animals has that one beat.",Nocturnal Animals

82,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,A tale of the perfect revenge,9,24 December 2016,"A novelist, Jake, spends decades of his life constructing the perfect revenge on his ex-wife, (who treated him poorly, was not supportive of him and his writing, cheated on him and left him, only to end up a foundering art gallery manager, now bored by the artificial art scene, and on the other side of a cheating spouse)the perfect revenge, in the form of living well. Completing his novel, and impressing her with it, becoming successful in his life, to the point where she wants him back, only for him to prove to her that he is finally done with her, and leave her waiting in a restaurant.Elegant and classy looking, but also violent and cruel, in its abrupt contrasts of her present life, and flashbacks to her husband, and a visualisation of his novel, about murder on a desolate desert road, which, in and of itself, would make a great movie. Michael Shannon is wonderful in the role of the cop on the case , who I was initially unsure if he was trustworthy. Unfortunately, his character abruptly disappeared, with no mention of him again. Brutally violent, these segments of the film (which probably take up 2/3 of the run time) have a very odd, Neo-noir/ western vibe to it, and feel like what it would have been like if David Lynch had directed Hell Or High Water.Gutsy, anticlimactic ending, showing that after she was very cruel and hurtful to him, how he, in a dignified way, gives her one final ""f*** you, for not believing in me""But by Jake's character dying in the novel, is he implying that he feels a bit of regret about what he is going to do (stand up his ex-wife), or is that meant to show that that part of him, that part of his life, is dead now, and he has finally moved on with his life?I love the poster artwork also, Adams' and Gyllenhaal's characters overlapping each other, in a faint apparition-like image.

83,begob,Something you never intended,9,22 June 2017,"An unhappy wife reads a story sent by her long estranged ex-husband, and their past comes back to haunt her.A deep and troubling story. A bizarre opening sequence introduces us to the carnival world of the heroine's successful yet vapid career, then we're plunged into the casual depression of her personal life, and then we enter the violence of the story within the story. That violence is not overly harsh, but the tension it creates is harrowing and seeps out into the main story as the past is gradually revealed.This is beautifully shot and performed, with profound themes tying together in a dark view of life. On first viewing I was really engaged in the story and ended up with the sense of something vitally true yet horribly sad - and still feeling there was more to understand and appreciate, that surely there must be some redemption.The time-lines switch between present, fantasy, and flash-back past, and the mood and pace vary as we pass in and out. Although the story in the present is subtle, there is one touch of horror with a dropped phone that nails an intense pessimism, but then the final scene was just vague enough to leave me turning things over in my mind. This has to be re-watched to pick up the full significance.The performances are excellent, especially those of the heroine and the law man. The music is mostly strings, not overdone, and the sound of the heartbeat reminded me of Looking For Mr Goodbar.Overall: Immaculate production that may be the most stylish horror movie.",Nocturnal Animals
84,bkrauser-81-311064,Sleazy and Not Much Else,6,18 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals starts with a tasty little trap during its beginning titles. Sporting hats and party favors, a throng of obese women parade naked across a white background; their raw, scintillating faces mismatched by their girth. It's a bold set of images, which are given with no context forcing the audience to either titter at the grotesqueness or feel unease at the exploitation. Come to find out the women are part of an art installation masterminded by a jaded, down-on-her luck art exhibitor named Susan (Adams). ""It was trash,"" she surmises later. ""It's all trash."" The film plays out like a movie within a movie with the outer-shell being occupied almost solely by Susan. She is sent a proof of an upcoming novel written by her estranged ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhaal) and despite trepidation, she decides to read it. The novel then transports her to an isolated area of West Texas where a middle class family is harassed by a group of miscreants on the road, lead by a particularly disgusting Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The trio of thugs brutally rape and kill the mother and daughter (Fisher and Bamber), leaving the family patriarch (also Gyllenhaal) to pick up the pieces. Somewhere in between Susan reading in the bedroom and reading in the bathroom, a third thread starts where we see the blossoming, stagnation and demise of Edward and Susan's relationship more than twenty years ago.Nocturnal Animals is a meticulously planned film from start to finish. It weaves a complicated web of stories which compliment each other (at least in their blocking) and clutter the mind with gruesome, repulsive imagery. The faux Fellini-esque vibrancy of Susan's world clashes violently with the dynamics of the novel's story which conjure memories of Blue Velvet (1986) and Straw Dogs (1971). Director Tom Ford's lustrous mis en scene in A Single Man (2009) drew comparisons to the works of Douglas Sirk but here the deviant allusions to choice grand manipulators a la Alfred Hitchcock and Brian De Palma are far too pungent to ignore.Yet for all its fastidious framing and on-the-nose color symbolism, Nocturnal Animals completely betrays its central message. In an interview with Vox Magazine, Tom Ford stated that the central theme of ""Tony and Susan"" (the Austin Wright novel with which Nocturnal Animals is based on) is ""don't throw people away. When you find people you love, hang on to them."" Yet I wonder how calcified that message is in the mind of the audience when we're essentially watching a revenge story from the perspective of the victim. A victim that projects her ex-husband, a man she likely never loved, as the only character in the novel without agency. Are we truly to believe such a hopeful message is being channeled by a woman who doesn't seem to love anyone.It's easier to assume that Tom Ford took the themes of ""Tony and Susan"" and inverted them in an attempt to give an already dense story another layer. Not so much keep the ones you love as hurt the ones you hate. Yet even then the three stories, which meshed well in the editing room, counter each other thematically like pieces on a chess board. One minute, we're supposed to eschew practicality for romanticism, then we're supposed to endorse vigilante justice, then we're supposed to quiver when Susan realizes Edward was the most practical choice after all.The proceedings are all so dour and trifling with so many divergent themes, that at times the movie feels like it's being splattered against a wall. While I'm sure someone out there is liable to get their kicks from Nocturnal Animals, I suspect the movie just wants to revel in its sleazy motifs and make its audience feel guilty for watching despite obvious manipulations. Ultimately in the words of Michael Sheen's character one needs to ""Take in and appreciate the absurdity,"" to really appreciate Nocturnal Animals. Understand that for all it's luridness this movie really isn't a puzzle worth solving.",Nocturnal Animals

86,valadas,A psychological movie,7,22 December 2016,"And a well told story though not exceptionally deep in my opinion. A curious and unusual narrative process: two parallel films within the same movie. The woman protagonist starts reading the manuscript of a book written and sent to her by her ex-husband whom she had left 19 years before for temper incompatibility and also because she didn't reckon him a great writer. And then we start attending two parallel stories: the book one, named Nocturnal Animals that tells a violently dramatic story of kidnapping, rape, murder and revenge which is shown in images and scenes all along the movie intermingled (passing abruptly from one to the other) with the psychological reactions of the protagonist who is passionately reading the manuscript the whole night through. She becomes very impressed and it reinforces her repentance for having left her first husband for recognizing him now a very good writer. Another psychological ingredient is that during her reading she calls her current husband (who is on a short business stay in another city) and becomes aware that he is having a case with another woman. The book story turns out very badly and the properly so called one too because her first husband misses the meeting she had asked him for probably to thus taking the revenge for having been estranged with which he had never agreed.",Nocturnal Animals
87,tomsview,Strangers in the night,9,1 March 2017,"This film has sequences about as dark as they come, mainly because they seem so real.The story develops on two levels. When Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is sent a manuscript of a book by her ex-husband, Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), the story within the manuscript plays out on the screen - it is harrowing cinema.Jake Gyllenhaal now plays Tony Hastings who is taking his family on a trip in West Texas when they are involved in a road rage incident. Although we sense that the story is meant to have relevance to the former marriage of Edward and Susan, Tony Hasting's wife and daughter are played by different actors: Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber. The whole sequence is a car driver's worst nightmare as Jake, his wife and their daughter are overwhelmed by a terrible situation.The story cuts back and forth between the real world and the story in the manuscript. But like Susan as she compulsively reads the story, I was anxious for the film to return to Edward's manuscript; it has an intensity I don't think I have felt since watching ""Se7en"" 20-years ago. Jake's guilt at his unpreparedness and inability to protect his family is the cold shiver that runs through the story even as other developments send it in an unexpected direction.Jake Gyllenhaall doesn't star in dud movies and I knew this would be good. Director Tom Ford has wrung a lot out of every scene including an off-the-wall opening sequence featuring naked, super plus-sized ladies; the beginning is a warning that this will not be an ordinary journey.The film has a beautifully nuanced, mainly orchestral score by Abel Korzenoiski whose work has a similar classiness to Alexandre Desplat's. No nomination for an Academy Award though - an oversight.Although the story in the manuscript is revenge on Amy Adams' character, I was so overwhelmed by the story within the story that I don't think I made the connection immediately, however, it's a film that not only leaves you reeling; it also leaves you thinking.",Nocturnal Animals
88,Abdulxoxo,Abrupt ending,6,21 July 2021,"This movie was directed in a very stylish way. The way the 3 parts of the film are connected really is crucial to the understanding, but it's done in a way that is far too complicated and abstract. In 'real life' Susan left Edward in a horrible, brutal way that deeply hurt Edward. When Edward sends Susan the manuscript, the story she reads is somewhat of a message to tell her how much she hurt him. Within the story, titled 'Nocturnal Animals', Tom sees his wife and daughter leave him in a horrible, brutal way. This mirroring is very intellectual and I'm sure there are people who love it; but I'm not one of those people. The one thing about Nocturnal Animals to enjoy was the actual West Texas story that Edward had written. It was a tense thriller, shocking and at times uncomfortable to watch - in a good way. Within that story the acting is fantastic. Gyllenhall is great as the wronged husband/father, Tony; Michael Shannon is terrific as the police officer, Bobby; and Aaron Taylor-Johnson is unrecognisable as the lead redneck, Ray. I would have loved this movie if that was the film. Unfortunately it is set up as a semi-fictitious story within the framework of Susan's 'real' life, it almost doesn't matter because it's always just a symbol to represent Edward's pain at Susan's actions in the past. Overall, the majority of the film is boring. And the final nail in its coffin was the way it ended. It was one of those films that just ended suddenly without any satisfactory conclusion.",Nocturnal Animals

In the past the great fear of Amy was to become just like her mother, now she has become just like her mother. She has married the ""reliable"" husband her mother liked, and of their marriage only a facade for the outside world is remaining.The link between the fictitional story, which looks like a Sam Peckinpah movie full of darkness and violence, and the real story is more elusive. For a moment you might think that the fictitional story contains autobiographical elements from the life of Susan and Edward when they were still together. One indication is the remark of Edward that all fiction has an autobiographical element in the ""past story"". Another indication is the casting of the different stories. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a character in the real story and a character in the fictitional story. Isla Fisher, who plays the wife of Jake Gyllenhaal in the fictitional story, looks very much like Amy Adams.On a certain point in the movie you have to come to the conclusion that the fictitional story is not about Susan and Edward. The question however remains if and which link exists between the two stories. The manuscript is not dedicated to Susan for no reason, isn't it? It is up to the spectator to answer this question. I still don't know the answer exactly.I do know however that the film is not only complex but also very beautiful, as is to be expected from a fashion designer like Ford. The present day story plays in very sterile settings, in which the ""beau monde"" is keeping up appearances at all costs. The fictitional story plays in ""fly over country"" as we know it from the films of the Coen brothers.",Nocturnal Animals
94,seymourblack-1,Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Twice,9,26 June 2018,"An L.A. art gallery owner who's beautiful, affluent and seemingly successful is surprised to find herself miserable, disillusioned and unfulfilled. Intriguingly, about this time, she receives the manuscript of her ex-husband's debut novel and when she reads it and recognises its metaphorical nature, becomes consumed by feelings of guilt, regret and the desire to meet up again with the man who was her first crush.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) and Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) had fallen in love as students in New York and the idealistic couple later married despite the opposition of Susan's mother who considered Edward to be unsuitable because he lacked the necessary ambition and drive to be a good provider. Susan, at this time, detested her mother's preoccupation with materialism but later in the marriage, became frustrated at Edward's lack of success as a novelist and broke up their relationship because she considered him to be too weak and not a very good writer.Edward's novel is a revenge thriller about a family of three who are driving along a West Texas highway at night when they get terrorized by a gang of vicious thugs, two of whom, kidnap Tony Hastings' (Jake Gyllenhaal) wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber), while the third gang member takes Tony to a remote spot in the desert where he leaves him stranded. Later, local detective Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) is assigned to the case and together the two men eventually discover the bodies of Laura and India who had both been raped and murdered. Tony, who is portrayed as a rather weak man, becomes obsessed with the need to wreak vengeance on all the gang members and with Andes' assistance, does so very effectively.As she's reading, Susan reflects on the cruel way in which she ended her first marriage by cheating on Edward and secretly having an abortion when she was carrying his child. She also recalls him saying that ""when you love someone, you work it out. Don't just throw it away. You have to be careful with it. You may never get it again"". In the years since their divorce, she has learned that those words were true and that her choice of opting for materialism over love was misguided. She also recalls him saying, after she'd been denigrating his work, that ""nobody writes about anything but themselves"". This makes his story about a man who was driven to revenge following the loss of the woman and child that he loved even more poignant and moves her to respond positively to his suggestion that they meet up to discuss his book. This reconciliation, however, doesn't materialise in the way that she had expected it might.Based on Austin Wright's 1993 novel ""Tony and Susan"", this absorbing psychological drama is incredibly stylish, well paced and a visual treat. The ways in which the action slips back and forth between different periods of Susan's relationship with Edward and the events described in his novel are also masterfully done so that the coherence of the whole story and its natural momentum are beautifully maintained throughout.The entire production is well acted with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal faultless in their lead roles and Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (as the leader of the thugs in Edward's book) providing very strong supporting performances. There's also a wonderful cameo featuring Laura Linney as Susan's mother which makes an incredible impact, especially considering its very short duration.",Nocturnal Animals
95,antoniotierno,violent and intense,7,18 November 2016,"Visually stunning, with something clinical about the way it dissects the relationships it depicts (with heat, anxiety and fear). The film is revelatory in some ways, a study in how heartbreak can be as savage as physical assault. The story-within-a-story structure works, mostly, though it also halts the momentum at times. Still, Nocturnal Animals -- which was inspired by Austin Wright's book Tony and Susan -- is certainly worth watching. And not just for Adams, who's impressive here (as is Laura Linney in a small-but-pivotal role as Susan's mother), but also to witness writer-director Tom Ford's confidence. If only the film more closely embraced the emotions at its core.",Nocturnal Animals

The cast is very good, Amy Adams acts in one more film a year, and she is very well, Jake Gyllenhaal is great, Michael Shannon is great too, was my favorite in the movie, Aaron Taylor- Johnson is great, and the rest Of the cast is very competent, the plot of the film is not told linearly, has moments of the present and past, may even seem confusing, but it is even simple to understand, the best scenes are that Jake Gyllenhaal is with Shannon, has scenes Shocking and very heavy, the mood of the film is very somber, the direction of Tom Ford is great, he develops the characters very well, the script even with leaving some things confusing, is very good, the film reminded me of the Nightcrawler in some aspects , Nocturnal Animals is an excellent film, one of the best films of 2016, will attend, it looks like to compete in several nominations at the 2017 Oscar.

97,proud_luddite,Nocturnal Animals,7,20 March 2018,"Three stories take place concurrently: 1)Susan (Amy Adams) is a well-off L.A. art gallery owner whose second marriage is in trouble. She receives a manuscript from her first husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) which she reads; 2) the manuscript story is played out in which a couple and their teenage daughter run into troublesome hooligans while traveling late at night in Texas; 3) in flashback, the story is told of the courtship and marriage between Susan and Edward.The opening credits are used against a backdrop that is an art gallery installation display. To put it as kindly as possible, this sequence can likely only be appreciated by lovers of modern art - or those who pretend to appreciate it for the sake of social-climbing. Otherwise, director Tom Ford has created a beautiful film with a cosmopolitan vibe with fabulous set designs and beautiful background music. He also uses clever techniques to switch between storylines.The Texas story begins with the perfect amount of suspense and tension. The trouble is that it is so well orchestrated that it becomes unbearable to watch the torment imposed on the young family. Within this sequence, Michael Shannon gives a standout performance as a no-BS law enforcer with health problems. He seems gruff but his heart is in the right place.There's a rather funny brief scene in the first story in which an art gallery meeting is taking place. One young woman is dressed in a way that makes one wonder if the rich really do have taste; the same can be said about another's choice in cosmetic surgery; a third one is addicted to modern technology in one of the worst ways imaginable, sadly resembling many people these days.While bizarre and uncomfortable at times, ""Nocturnal Animals"" still comes off as a film with style and skill.",Nocturnal Animals
98,gedikreverdi,Tony is indeed a weak man.,7,5 March 2021,The movie was good but tony was so incapable so weak and such a loser that I ended up disliking him. They were stopped by a car on the interstate and his wife and daughter were abducted by two men while the third guy made him drive into the desert and left him there alone and drove off. The next day they found the bodies of them. The officer with lung cancer offered him help when the two got released because the evidence wasn't sufficient. The officer was the best character in the film. They took them to a place of the officer and our loser let them escape. The officer shot one of them dead while the annoying one ray got away. Tony found him in the shed in the desert. He shot him but he could hit him back with an iron bar in the head. He woke up and walked outside and fell to the ground. He couldn't see and show himself. He replied to the mail of the woman who left him for a handsome guy and said he'd want to meet her. She waited for him the entire evening at the restaurant but he didn't show up. The first half of the movie was excellent as the scene on the highway was extremely tense and scary. The woman reading the novel as we see what he read throughout the whole movie was nice but nothing extraordinary. Then Tony couldn't stop being an extremely weak man and this started to get on my nerves and I started to dislike the movie as he was the protagonist. Overall it was a nice watch and I really like Michael Shannon and his character in this film.,Nocturnal Animals
99,maurice_yacowar,Novelist avenges wife's betrayal,9,17 December 2016,"Three prominent works of art encapsulate the film's major themes.(1) Damien Hurst's sculpture of a bull as Saint Sebastian, pierced by arrows. Sebastian registers as tortured, martyred saintliness, which the bull here redefines as the masculine life force. As in his debut, A Single Man, writer/director Tom Ford examines the abuse of sensitivity in American men. Susan's brother is disowned and banished from his family for being gay. Her mother dismisses the sensitive writer Edward as weak and unambitious. Susan has the courage to marry him anyway. But she weakens as her mother's internalized blues take hold. When she ""grows into"" her mother's bourgeois values Susan abandons art-making for art history and then running a commercial gallery. She leaves Edward in favour of slick, specious businessman Hutton who goes on to betray her. Hutton arranges her abortion of Edward's child. As Hutton seems successful but is warding off bankruptcy he personifies the fake status of his and her parents' world.Edward dedicates his novel to Susan and says she inspired it. The hero, which she visualizes as him, loses his wife and daughter to rape and murder when he lacks the brute force to oppose the three brutes. Where in real life Edward watched Hutton drive Susan away after her abortion, in the novel he watches his wife and daughter (who in Susan's visualization resemble her and her daughter) driven away by the abductors. Edward lost Susan to her adoption of her mother's values, i.e., to the shallow gloss of the stylish elitist life. In the novel he loses her to savages, evil night creatures, antithetical to the elegants but in effect equivalent. (2) A Christopher Wool-like painting spells out three layered syllables of ""Revenge."" In the novel the hero avenges his wife and daughter by killing one of the assailants and identifying another for prosecution. He seems to kill himself in the process. As his character turns from civilized husband into illegal killer, he demonstrates the moral cost of abandoning the ""weakness"" of the civilized, honest citizen. So his novel is a form of revenge against Susan for having left him because of his softness. The novel's power proves Susan was wrong to have lost faith in him as a writer. Her own dissatisfaction with her luxurious life (and husband) and her high-quality art gallery similarly proves she was wrong to have abandoned her initial calling, making art, which paralleled her leaving him. In her new life she can't sleep because — despite her elegance, status, culture and material success — she is still the ""nocturnal animal"" Edward called her, a person of imagination and creativity. She can't sleep because she denied both her own nature as an artist and her love for Edward. The film ends with her alone in the restaurant where she was to meet Edward. He's standing her up, just when she seems set to take him back (witness her removal of her bright red lipstick and her plotted décolletage), is a second revenge. It's not a vicious revenge, though, just a reminder of what he warned earlier. When you reject a true love — or one's essential self — it can't simply be recovered. There's yet another revenge here. As Edward's novel avenges her abandoning him, Ford's film takes a kind of revenge upon the society in which he has made his fame and fortune as a top-drawer fashion designer. Susan's scene with her mother, the gallery scenes and her husband's betrayal define Ford's other, non-film professional world as shallow, materialistic, dishonest and vain. In fact, the scenes of Susan's real life have such artificial performances and are so shot with the glossy colours and composition of luxury product advertising, that her reality seems artificial. Her visualization of Edward's novel, with its vulgarity, violence and vile characters, seems realistic. (3) John Currin's painting of a large nude woman distorted by an oval lens is another version of the coarse fleshy life that elegant art tends to ignore. Hence — in shocking contrast — the very obese nudes dancing through the opening titles and on screens in Susan's exhibition. That show combines the large screen images with the fleshy women themselves on platforms, either in person or in 3-D sculptures.The latter ambiguity parallels the film's shift between Susan's life scenes, now or in flashback, and her visualization of her ex-husband's novel. Art and life continually collide and overlap, because art evades reality even as it confronts it. Hence the novel's plot line which breaks away from Edward's earlier writing about himself (Susan's complaint) and yet works out a form of his self-realization and self- presentation. The tension and confusion between art and life have often been treated in film, but rarely with such complexity and moral engagement. The gallery world is far from the novel's vile hicks but it has a similar rapacity and abusive treatment of the vulnerable. The novel's family is driving to the artists town of Marfa when they are run off the road and destroyed. The three settings — the NYC college world, the LA gallery scene, the arid waste of West Texas — provide a geographical summary of America. In the current climate they are also a cross-section of Donald Trump's support: Susan's arch-Republican parents, the corrupt and corrupting wealth of the elitist gallery and fashion scene and the violent sexist and racist Texas villains. Tom Ford is one of the people making American film great again.",Nocturnal Animals

I entered the theater feeling uncertain of it being any good.. since I didn't hear too much buzz about it. I watched it absolutely entranced, from the first to last shot. I left the theater, stumbling, feeling confused and unsettled. I didn't understand what I just watched, but I knew it made me feel something. Great films make you feel something, even when they at first don't make sense. David Lynch would be proud.Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams are electrifying. It tells the story of the consequences of lost love, and the power of true love for family, and the lengths one will go to avenge the love you have for them if they are ever taken away from you. The juxtaposition between the two is immensely disturbing. Not to mention the abduction scene involving the three redneck serial killers that just might be the most chilling and intense scene in any movie since the chicken bone scene in Killer Joe.

103,rockman182,Nocturnal Animals (2016),8,8 December 2016,"recall enjoying Ford's A Single Man but not on a level where its something I wanted to go back to Having seen A Single Man a while ago, I couldn't remember much about it. Therefore I was not familiar with Tom Ford's style. Thus, I was impressed with this film and the style of storytelling. The film is told with three stories that are interwoven and it switches back and forth very often. Each of the timelines/universes are not only intriguing but have you wide eyed and ready to see more. Its sleek at times when set in the modern day and manages to become a Western Texas thriller when it switches to the written novel story. The performances are great, which is what you'd expect from a cast of this caliber. Adams and Gyllenhaal are great but this is the best I've seen from Aaron Taylor-Johnson. His portrayal of a trouble making Southern man bordering on psychopathy is quite astounding. Michael Shannon is always great in what he does and this was no exception, hes definitely more subdued in this because we all know he has the ability to go to level 11. Even got Nightcrawler psycho vibes from a certain scene from Jake in this. While this was a very fun and absorbing film I wanted another twenty minutes and was a bit unsatisfied and left wanting from the end. However, upon further reflection that ending is quite brilliant. I can't talk about it without spoiling but this film certainly needs a second watch for its imagery and connectivity between its stories. Its layered, so it'll be a joy to decipher.8/10",Nocturnal Animals

105,cultfilmfan,Nocturnal Animals,10,17 December 2016,"The year 2016, or what is left of it and the films that are being released now and through early January, is becoming increasingly more difficult for a run of the mill critic as myself to do a yearly top 10 best films list, or even just choose one film alone that is worthy of the honour of being the best of the year. At one point I would have said either The Edge of Seventeen, Christine, or Rules Don't Apply would have definitely been my current top picks and now you have a film like Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals, which just completely blew me away in every single aspect and to use a term anything less than masterpiece for it would simply not do it justice. It is that well done of a film that you could literally write a whole essay on the various philosophical, social and human elements of the film and you could write a good lengthy piece on a film such as this because it is such a richly layered film and every single scene and second in the film is meaningful and there is not one single wasted shot, or scene that does not help tie everything together and just add that much more intrigue and basically just awe of what a great piece of storytelling and filmmaking this is. Tom Ford is previously from the fashion world and this is his second film as a director and his first at writing a screenplay and yet he feels so focused here and like the world of film is nothing that is new to him and it is like he has meticulously studied it and knows every single in and out of it because here he has crafted a film that is perfect on every single level that some directors who have had more time, or experience in the film world could not pull off a film that has the sheer level of brilliance and artistry that this one does. Thankfully as with many films I choose to see, I really did not know much if anything before walking into the theatre for this film which was a good thing because just letting this film slowly reveal itself and it's various plot points, mysteries and just everything that made this film so perfectly entertaining and captivating from the moment it starts was a real joy to watch it unfold before me. I really never knew what kind of a direction this film was going to go in, so it certainly was never predictable and every time something new, or unexpected happens during the course of the film it not only was a big thrill for the characters in the film, but for me watching it as well. This film is certainly very dark and one could go as far as to say it is very bleak, but that was one of the things that truly attracted me to this story. A film with all differing levels of how we as humans wrong each other and can so painfully hurt and cause wrong to one another and yet done in a way that truly has so much character study with the wonderfully written characters we have here as well as being a critique on the art world as well as how flippant and sometimes lazy humans are at relationships and how truly thoughtless we can be to one another and how we can totally and completely disregard the feelings of others. The film works as a great character study and a sad, but important look at the state of how we put money and success first in our lives, but also again how we as humans continue to live, rebel and treat each other and the world around us without truly thinking of our actions until sometimes the very worst will happen. The film also works as a thriller and certainly one of the best of recent years, or really of all time and there certainly are moments that will have you completely chilled to the bone and a couple of times where you might just jump right out of that comfortable theatre seat. The film was so fascinating that I could not take my eyes off the screen even if what I was watching was cruel, or hard to look at because Tom Ford really invested us into this story and these characters like so few filmmakers are able to do this well. The film is very stylish to look at in it's more modern day New York settings, but also the more run down and gritty aspects of the film in areas around Texas, also have a sense of filthiness and grime that gets to you and makes you squirm and feel uncomfortable in your seat because of it. Tom Ford knows how to do fashion and he also knows art, how to tell a story and how to capture it with feeling and with style. The performances here as well are some of this year's absolute best. If Amy Adams is nominated for acting this year it should definitely be for this and not the empty Arrival. Everyone else, particularly some of the supporting performances are so spot on and just beautifully handled and performed that I can truly say that there was not a weak performance in the whole film and it is some of the best acting I have ever seen. Not to mention that the story and film itself is gripping and disturbing and once it grabs hold of you it doesn't let go. These are all the signs of a great film, my friends and this is one that will be studied in film classes and lecture halls come years go by and it is certainly a magnificent achievement on all levels and perhaps this year's best film and also one of the best films perhaps of any decade. True filmmaking power and art that is not to be missed.",Nocturnal Animals
106,carbuff,"Oh well, 2 hours of my life lost to self-important Hollywood drivel",2,2 March 2020,"""Nocturnal Animals"" was a major let-down to me. I'm giving it two stars instead of one, because, much to my shame, I watched it to the end. Jake Gyllenhaal is rapidly becoming one of my least favorite actors, while serving as an excellent contrary indicator of how rewarding I'll find a particular film experience.I suppose the basic premise is interesting enough. It's a reasonably original take on a story within a story, but everybody in the movie (with the exception of the no-nonsense lawman) comes across as parodies of self-important ""creatives"". Under some circumstances this wouldn't be a problem, except that unfortunately in this case they weren't supposed to be parodies.This was meant to be a high-concept film offering a big statement about life. Something about the nature of ""love"" I think, but the biggest statement it actually made was that the Hollywood-types behind this ""work of art"" don't live in real world with the rest of us. I guess swimming in money, luxuriating in absurd creature comforts, and being surrounded by kowtowing sycophants has an insulating effect on people, not that I'll ever know. Thank god for my relative poverty I suppose.Also, making it all the worse, these poor, suffering, ""creatives"" care so much about everything that they're in mental anguish--although it's safe to say that they're not hurting nearly as much as I was after sitting through two hours of this self-indulgent drivel. So, if you're interested in a big-budget art film thriller meant to feel deep without any actual depth, look no further, but, otherwise, you might be better off with a Michael Bay production--admittedly a harsh indictment.",Nocturnal Animals

Be warned, there is head scratching right from the bizarre opening credits.The story within the story is an interesting concept but neither of the stories are compelling. The revenge violence story is hard to watch. The reading of the story and tossing the manuscript sums things up. The most watchable segments are the flashbacks of the early relationship. Nearly every scene seems to long. There are too many shots of the leads staring in contemplation. There are fades to black that last too long. Too much time is spent cleansing in the shower or tub. The best performance is highlighted by smoking, coughing and spitting. The contemporary scenes are high styled to distraction. The gallery workers attire is laughable. The ""Revenge"" painting is ridiculously unsubtle. Perhaps the real revenge is asking the ex to read the rape and murder story.There is no reason to spend time with these characters.

111,dave-mcclain,outstanding acting and storytelling which will leave you thinking long after you leave the theater,9,11 December 2016,"Telling a story within a story is a literary device which is used in ""One Thousand and One Nights"" (also known as ""Arabian Nights"") and can even be found in Homer's ""Odyssey"" from Ancient Greece. In film, this story-telling technique can take the form of someone telling a story within the film, a play within the film, a film within the film or even a novel within the film. Movies which have featured a story within its overarching story are as diverse as the classic fantasy ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), the musical ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952), the Mel Brooks comedy ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974), the horror film ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994) and the adventure movie ""Life of Pi"" (2012). We're not just talking about flashbacks here. Each of these films has a plot which has, at its heart, another complete and cohesive story, often designed to teach the film's ""real world"" characters a lesson and often paralleling or reflecting their actions or history. A more recent example of such a film is the thriller ""Nocturnal Animals"" (R, 1:56).Susan Morrow (multiple Oscar nominee Amy Adams) owns a trendy L.A. art gallery (be prepared for scenes of graphic nudity in the film's opening minutes which show her most recent exhibit), but Susan is not happy with her life. She got divorced from a writer named Edward Sheffield (Oscar nominee Jake Gyllenhaal) two decades years earlier, but still regrets how she treated him and how she ended their relationship. Susan is currently in a joyless marriage to struggling businessman Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer) who often leaves her alone when he's away on business, or pursuing (ahem) other interests. Out of the blue, Susan receives a package containing a manuscript of her ex-husband's latest novel. It's called ""Nocturnal Animals"", which is a reference to his old nickname for her because of her insomnia, and the dedication page has her name on it. During one of her husband's weekend absences, Susan uses her alone time to read Edward's book. In it, she sees reflections of her life with Tony. We see many of those moments play out in flashback, as we also see the book's harrowing and provocative plot unfold Tony Hastings (also played by Gyllenhaal) is driving his wife, Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter, India (Ellie Bamber) across rural western Texas when they are harassed by a trio of local hoodlums (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Karl Glusman and Robert Aramayo) who are in another car on that dark and desolate stretch of highway. When the other car runs his off the road, Tony and his family are treated, let's just say, extremely rudely by the trio. Laws are broken and Tony embarks on a determined search for justice. Tony's main advocate in his quest is tough Texas police detective Bobby Andes (Oscar nominee Michael Shannon). For his own very personal reasons, Bobby is just as determined as Tony to see justice done – no matter how long it takes – and seems willing to go outside of usual procedures.""Nocturnal Animals"" features outstanding acting and storytelling which will leave you thinking long after you leave the theater. Each of the film's two main stories are strong enough to constitute a movie on their own. Together, they're extremely powerful and thought-provoking. They're also expertly scripted and directed by Tom Ford (adapting Austin Wright's 1993 novel ""Tony and Susan"") and perfectly edited. Even with a story within a story and flashback scenes, the film is never confusing and always engaging. Add in the award-worthy performances, and this is one is not to be missed.

112,joebloggscity,Dark & Nasty inter-splicing tale......,7,12 March 2018,"You can't really fault anything with Jake Gayllenhaal in it. He takes chances, and you can't tell before you're into the film if he is playing the hero or anti-hero. He is a wonderful actor, and in this film he is supported by Michael Shannon who keeps showing a great presence he is in films.Sadly the main lead is Amy Adams who I just don't warm too, and in this it's the same. She's just a very plain vanilla actress I find.Shame as what we have in this film is a good film that splices different tales as cheated on women finds some escape and torment by a gruesome novel devoted to her by her ex-husband. We go on a tour of emotions and fears, and one moment made me jump really out of my seat. It's a bonfire of the emotions for the rich yuppies in this movie, but it's also a dark & nasty movie.
 
Kind of reminded me of 'Enemy', another Jake Gyllenhaal movie, due to the themes. Both psychological dark tales.Again I'd recommend this. It's by no means perfect, but it's challenging and enjoyable. A few changes could have made it greater, but as it is it is still a damn fine movie.",Nocturnal Animals
113,agmoldham,Didn't quite work for me,4,23 July 2017,"There is no doubt that this is a pretty interesting film and quite sure that many people will enjoy it more than I did.The movie is a story inside a story. Amy Adams plays Susan who is reading a book from her ex husband Edward. Personally I found the book story far more engaging and interesting than the real life storyline. For me the real life story felt very cold and unreal. I have no doubt that many people will find that part of the movie the best, but it just didn't work for me. The plot line of the book worked a lot better and created far more tension.It's undoubtedly a bold movie and should be praised for that. Well worth a watch.",Nocturnal Animals
114,bob-the-movie-man,Putting the Crisis into Mid-life Crisis,8,17 November 2016,"""Do you think your life has turned into something you never intended?"" So asks Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) to her young assistant, who obviously looks baffled. ""Of course, not – you're still young"". Susan is in a mid-life crisis. While successful within the opulent Los Angeles art scene her personal life is crashing to the ground around her: her marriage (to Hutton (Armie Hammer, ""The Man From Uncle"") ) appears to be cooling fast amid financial worries.In the midst of this rudderless time a manuscript from her ex-husband, struggling writer Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), turns up out of the blue. As we see in flashback, Edward is a man let down on multiple levels by Susan in the past. His novel – ""Nocturnal Animals"", dedicated to Susan – is a primal scream of twenty years worth of hurt, pain, regret and vengeance; a railing against a loss of love; a railing against a loss of life.As Susan painfully turns the pages we live the book as a 'film within a film' – with characters casually modelled on Edward, Susan and Susan's daughter, actually played by Gyllenhaal, Amy-Adams-lookalike Isla Fisher (""Grimsby"") and Ellie Bamber (""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") respectively. The insomniac Susan is seriously moved. She feels likes someone who's fallen asleep on the train of life and doesn't recognise any of the stations when she wakes up. How will Susan's regrets translate into action? Should she take up Edwards offer to meet up for dinner?This Tom Ford film – only his second after the wildly successful ""A Single Man"" in 2009 – is a challenging film to watch. The opening titles of naked overweight woman 'twerkers' is challenging enough (#wobble). After this shocking opening (that morphs into an art gallery installation) the LA scenes have a gloriously Hitchcockian/noir feel to them, being gorgeously filmed by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (""The Accountant"", ""The Avengers"") – an Oscar nomination I would suggest should be in the offing.And then comes the start of the ""book"" segment: one of the most uncomfortably tense scenes I've seen this year. A Texan family horror film with a lonely highway and a quartet of Trump voters, who are not just in the ""basket of deplorables"" but buried right at the very festering bottom of it. As stark contrast to the sharp lines and glamour of LA, these scenes are reminiscent of ""No Country for Old Men"" with a searingly unpleasant performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson (""Kick-Ass"") and an equally queasy turn by local law enforcer Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon, Zod in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice""). Either or both of these gentlemen could be contenders for a Supporting Actor nomination. The tension is superbly notched up by a mesmerising cello/violin score by Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski.Amy Adams is fantastic in the leading role (what with ""Arrival"" this month, this is quite a month for the actress) as is Jake Gyllenhaal, channelling so much emotion, angst and guilt at his own impotence. After ""Nightcrawler"" Gyllenhaal is building up a formidable reputation that must translate into an Oscar some time soon: possibly this is it. Some excellent cameos from Laura Linney (as Susan's sad-eyed mother) and Michael Sheen (in a superb purple jacket) rounds off an excellent ensemble cast.The concept of a ""film within a film"" is not new. The most memorable example (I realise with a shock – #midlifecrisis) was ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" with a young but striking Meryl Streep 35 years ago. Here the LA sequence, the book and the flashback scenes are beautifully merged into a seamless whole where you never seem to get lost or disorientated.If there is a criticism to be made, the second half of the 'book' is not as satisfying as the first with some rather clunky plot points that fall a little too easily. However, this is a nuanced film where every step and every scene feels sculpted and filled with meaning. It is a film that deserves repeat viewings, since it raises questions and thoughts that survive long after the lights have come up. Tom Ford's output may be of a sparsity of Kubrick proportions, but like Kubrick his output is certainly worth waiting for.Recommended, but go mentally prepared: this was a UK 15 certificate, but it felt like it should be more of a UK 18.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

115,witster18,Ford Channels His Inner De Palma - Niiiiice!,9,29 March 2017,"I will admit that I'm a sucker for this type of film. Multiple narratives, brooding violent thriller, polished 80's De Palma-esque.. yea, definitely a kid in the candy store moment.Nocturnal Animals is very clever. It uses one narrative to express the feelings of the characters in another. Ford's film looks absolutely fantastic. The pacing is perfect. I know not everyone will love it, mostly because it does not have a cookie-cutter Hollywood payoff. The shock-symbolism of the opening credits may be a bit much for some too - even me. It's like 1998's ""Great Expectations"" met 2016's ""Hell or High Water"". Speaking of, it just moved into the #2 spot ahead of the latter, as the 2nd best film I've seen from last year, 54 films through a watchlist of 89 films. It is fresh in my mind so I could flip-flop those back later. It will likely hold a top-5 spot when all is said and done.The film asks a lot of questions about fate, social classes, and the strength of men. The audience keeps questioning the reality and significance of the parallel narrative until after credits role. That's the aspect that put this in the 9 range for me.Worth another view, and soon. There's still a few more pieces of the puzzle I might have missed. A thought provoking, excellent film. Kudos to the entire cast and the director. If you want to watch a sharp, thought provoking thriller, look no further.",Nocturnal Animals
116,Movi3DO,Don't feel the story,7,10 May 2021,"Ah Jake Gyllenhaal in another weird art movie.I felt pretty mixed about this movie. What I liked was the performance, which were strong from Amy Adams, Jake, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Michael Shannon. I was most impressed with Aaron, however. He played a major d-bag character that really got under my skin and pissed me off. Jake was at his usual emotionally unstable character, and I loved it.Also, the visuals were stunning. The movie looked slick and gorgeous, except the opening scene. The parallels between the real world and fictional world were shown smoothly.However, what I didn't like was the story. For the majority of it, I was wondering about the story in the novel, and I didn't find it all that intense. It wasn't like I haven't seen the story before. Not gonna lie, I got certain things from the movie, but I wasn't able to string everything together to get the overall theme. Had to ask Google for help. Still, I wasn't satisfied with the progression of the plot.Overall, strong acting and visuals, but I wasn't on board with the story. 6.5/10.",Nocturnal Animals
117,Blue-Grotto,Stylish and Thrilling,10,26 September 2016,"With a sudden thump on the window a wild bird is stunned. It is reduced to a heap of feathers and a barely beating heart. Through fantastic imagery, talented and stylish actors at the top of their game, an amazing and fastidious director, and an enthralling and thrilling story, the characters in the film go through transformations similar to that of the dazed bird. So did I. The film resonated deeply with me. ""I just can't do this anymore."" I was shocked with this line that was said to me in the same situation and manner.Despite her wealth and ownership of a Los Angeles art gallery, Susan (Amy Adams) is troubled by the absences and indifference of her husband. She unexpectedly receives a manuscript from Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal), her long estranged ex-husband. Passages from the manuscript contain eerie parallels to her past and present life. Reality is strangely infused into the story line. As Susan reads, memories and emotions come flooding back. She struggled with unhappiness then. Despite significant life changes, she still struggles with it. She let go of a good man, yet maybe because she needed to. This is what she tells herself. In Ford's stellar and meticulously made film, even side conversations have substance and pictures on walls are connected to the story line. Certain scenes alone make the film worth watching. This includes an unorthodox interrogation by actor Michael Shannon. Shannon is extremely ruthless and convincing. Laura Linney appears as Susan's mother. She is even more brutal, in her own way, than Shannon. In a separate flashback scene, where all that is heard is a heartbeat, I was spellbound. The unexpected ending, the even more surprising opening, the twists and turns, and depth of the film, thrilled and delighted me. Tom Ford's background in the design industry is apparent in the spectacular lighting, stylish clothes and sophisticated dialogue. In the second showing of the film in North America, Ford received a standing ovation. I stood too. I loved listening to him talk and teasing people in the front row for distracting him with their cell phone cameras. His theme; do not let go of love if and when you find it.

118,brankovranjkovic,Nocturnal animals – Story within a Story.,8,5 November 2016,"This is a highly stylised, thriller from Tom Ford. A violent film with a revenge theme, a theme reflected in several of the characters.The opening title sequence shows several obese women, gyrating in burlesque costumes (weird!), this is evidently a human art installation, and we then learn that the female lead character 'Susan' is an art dealer.Susan, receives a package in the post, a draft manuscript from her ex-husband 'Edward', who was a struggling author and who she hasn't spoken to for 20 years. The book is called 'Nocturnal Animals' and is dedicated to herself. She begins to read while her current husband is away on 'business' and imagines the scenes set out in the book.As she continues reading she begins to question her current loveless marriage. There are many flash- backs to her early life, when she first met her ex-husband. The atmosphere is clearly illustrated by a flash-back involving her mum, who warns her not to marry the author due to his inability to financially provide for her. Susan is in love and not concerned, but her mum knows best and says 'we all turn into our mothers'. The author's story is about himself 'Edward' on a road trip with his wife and daughter, they're run off the road and are abducted. The wife and daughter are both raped and murdered.Edward is too weak to confront the situation in a violent manner, maybe Mr. 'everyman' would behave in the same way. Enter Michael Shannon's character, he gives a standout and award worthy performance as the detective who is assigned to the case. He has an unorthodox approach to allowing Edward to avenge the murder of his family. His style of law enforcement is one I agreed with.Throughout the film there are several flash-backs to Susan reading the novel, this reminds us that the action is fiction. But we can't help wondering whether this really happened? The author's skill makes the book seem really real. The story builds to a dramatic climax.You may already know that Tom Ford is also a top fashion designer and so from the world this film depicts, he appreciates that part of society more than most and has created a complex film certainly worth watching, and probably more than once.",Nocturnal Animals

Well it's basically two movies in one. One half appeals to my lust for grim blood soaked, dark genre fare while the other half plays like an interpersonal glossy drama that's just as compelling. Both feel as if they could hold entire films in their own right and grabbed me till the very end. It's much better if you go in cold so I won't really say much more but if you love a good thriller, crime drama or just good film making in general and it's playing near you please do yourself a favor and let Mr Tom Ford take you on a trip through some movie magic.",Nocturnal Animals
120,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,6 August 2017,"Do you like movies that expect you to be fully concentrated throughout it and that make you think hours after it ended? Well, that's Nocturnal Animals. A lot of people disliked this film because of it, so I'm saying it to you straight: if you don't like watching movies that leave you with a bunch of unanswered questions and that expect you to solve them, then forget it, this isn't a movie for you ...The narratives are so well-constructed, Tom Ford directed this movie brilliantly. The production design is amazing with all the visual cues and the editing is excellent (it increases the confusion purposely). The story within the story is obviously the most captivating and fascinatingly dark. So dark. It's unbelievably tense, emotional and Tom Ford does a great job connecting them all (even if he's sloppy and pretentious at some points).The casting is one of the best of 2016. Amy Adams is very good (better in Arrival), but the biggest praise goes to Jake Gyllenhaal (also plays Tony Hastings), who continues to be ignored even when he's one of the greatest actors of his generation and he keeps proving that over and over again ... Wake up, Hollywood! Michael Shannon (Bobby Andes) is absolutely perfect and an Oscar nomination is more than deserved, as well as Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Ray Marcus), who looks so, but so much dark and creepy that I started to feel disgusted just by looking at him, which is a great compliment since that's what he's supposed to make me feel.It's really a great movie, it's very different and unconventional (a lot of people are going to hate it as they hated Swiss Army Man, just because they don't follow the common path) and the opening scene alone ... Well, it might be the biggest shock in the entire film for some people. There's an open ending, so a lot of internet theories were already created, but I suggest you think by yourself and try to make sense of all of it. There isn't a solution for this film ending, it depends on the interpretation of each viewer, so think. Just think.The only issues I find with this film are, as I said above, the excessive visual cues that Tom Ford sometimes gets a little too pretentious and sloppy using them and the fact that the book's story is so captivating that takes away some interest in the others. Also, even if mostly well done, he doesn't always get a cohesive connection between the narratives, especially when he tries to compare them all together.However, Nocturnal Animals is a great unconventional film with amazing narratives that connect with each other (mostly) well. The cast is ridiculously good with major praise to Gyllenhaal and Sheen, and Tom Ford's directing is wonderful, even if sloppy at points. This is a dark and tense film that leaves us thinking of all the unanswered questions and the captivating story that I can't wait to rewatch.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Nocturnal Animals

I really like the actress, I had heard a lot and well from this movie. The wait was worth it, but it leaves me half.I am convinced that the choice of Amy Adams is basically for box office reasons. Your cache is not too high yet, but it is already public. It's not that I do not like her in the film, the other way around is fine, telling what her role can offer, which is very little. The movie is on the other side.Michael Shannon is great. So was Jake Gyllenhaal. They both carry the movie.I like the point of view that it offers and the question that it entails, it brings with it a very interesting debate and that I have already heard in the people in the street, a few times. The question of whether you are dying, what would you do with the time you have left?You have a great picture. It serves to narrate and it is also pretty.I can not say the same thing about management in terms of planning. It does not have nice and narrative plans, they are simple. Otherwise, the movie drags you and engulfs you, but this leaves the end like that, I do not like it. It's the biggest mistake I see in the movie, which is so open.It's a good thriller, well done.

126,MrDHWong,An engaging story about the aftermath of a failed marriage,8,24 May 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a psychological thriller starring Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Based on the novel ""Tony and Susan"" by Austin Wright, the film is a beautiful looking neo-noir tale of revenge and features yet another great acting performance from Amy Adams.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), the affluent owner of an art gallery in Los Angeles, receives an advance copy of a novel written by her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). Upon reading the novel, titled ""Nocturnal Animals"" after a nickname Edward once gave her, Susan becomes obsessively engrossed in the story and situations pertaining to its characters, which she begins to interpret as a metaphor for her failed marriage.Haunting, suspenseful, and well-acted, Nocturnal Animals is an engaging story about the aftermath of an unsuccessful relationship. Director Tom Ford makes great use of colour and lighting to enhance the mood and immerse the audience in the plot. Amy Adams' performance in the film is terrific, as to be expected and along with Arrival, this is easily one of her best most recent roles. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon shine as well, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives a surprisingly chilling portrayal as the villain of the film.I rate it 8/10",Nocturnal Animals

128,CANpatbuck3664,"Full of Highs and Lows, Nocturnal Animals Ends up Somewhere in the Middle",6,16 February 2017,"This was another movie I just didn't have the access to because of the limited release. Most of the people who wanted to see this were either familiar with the book (Tony and Susan) or they were excited because Tom Ford was directing (he made the very well received A Simple Man which I've yet to see). I was interested because of how dark the trailer made the movie look, it looked like a combination of The Words (the story within a story element) and a horror movie. Having seen it now, this movie is definitely more for the art-house crowd, there was some good stuff in it but the imagery and pace of the movie are far from the norm.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) seems to have everything that she could want but she remains unhappy. She has a new exhibit (the movie opens with the art displayed at her show, some morbidly obese women dancing with sparklers), she lives in a magnificent house and she has an impressive spouse in Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer). Further examination gives us some clues, there seems to be very little passion for the art she's displaying. Her marriage is falling apart, Hutton and Susan's interactions are cooler than a winter storm. We also find out that Hutton has run into some financial troubles. She's taken aback one day because she receives a manuscript for a book by courier. It was written by her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) and personally dedicated to her. He leaves a note with the package asking for her feedback but as she begins to read it, she becomes more concerned with the subject matter than how well it was written.I was warned about the start of Nocturnal Animals and still somehow I was taken aback by it. It wasn't fun to watch, I got the point of what it was trying to say, it just seemed to be more in there for shock value than to add to the story somehow. I did my best to push past it though, I just took it as the creative team setting up the visual style for the film. This movie is gorgeous for most of it's run time. The cinematography takes full advantage of the desert vistas, combining beautiful camera work with great atmosphere. The costuming was impressive too, the vibrant clothing added to the cool and sterile feel of this world.I'll admit this was one of the creepiest thrillers I've seen lately. The movie instills this uneasy feeling in you for most of the run time, whether you're in Susan's reality or in Edward's story. The movie is appropriately dark and with the subject matter they're dealing with, that definitely fits. Some violent and malicious things go down in Nocturnal Animals and to make light of it would feel wrong and out of place.I could see why this movie garnered some awards attention for the acting categories, I just would have picked different actors in the cast. Amy Adams did a good job with what she was given. She has to act so emotionally withdrawn for most of the film which keeps you from bonding with her character, I guess that was the desired effect. Jake Gyllenhaal gets the more intense part and just like every other movie he's made lately, he delivers. I think the more noticeable performances came in the supporting roles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson brought it up to the next level for this movie. I still didn't quite buy him as a violent sociopath redneck but this was easily my favourite performance by him. I ended up liking Michael Shannon the best, the guy is one of the best character actors out there and he knows just how to play things low-key enough to be effective. Laura Linney was really great in the short amount of time she was in the movie. Armie Hammer wasn't as charismatic as Johnson or Shannon but he's pitch perfect beside Amy Adams.My biggest issue with Nocturnal Animals (other than the weird beginning) was the fact that one of the two stories was so much more interesting than the other. The story in Edward's novel is full of drama and very intense, you definitely want to know where the story is going and what is going to happen next. It was so creepy that every time they cut away from it, I kept hoping they would go back. Telling a story in a story is difficult and I really do think that this movie did it better than most. The problem is that everything actually happens to Susan seems very mundane by comparison.This movie had almost completely won me back but then the ending fizzled out. I dug how Edward's story wrapped up but there's this big overarching metaphor of revenge and you think that Susan's going to get her comeuppance in the end. But the final notes of the story are very civil and more realistic. I respect their decision to head in that direction but it felt like a lot of buildup for nothing.This is one of those movies that seems destined to be adored by some and despised by the rest. I can see both sides of that, I found things to like and things to brush off. I wish that this movie had been a little more toned-down, I think that would have helped free up the story a bit better. I liked this movie better than I didn't by the end but I won't be revisiting it any time soon. Watch this at your own risk, if the synopsis doesn't interest you, this won't be your cup of tea.",Nocturnal Animals

I am always leery when I hear about violence in a film, but I was prepared for it ahead of time and in the movie it's more like dreading what might happen, rather than what actually happens. but let's be clear-this is not for the squeamish in that regard. but it is a movie for movie lovers. looking forward to tom's next venture.",Nocturnal Animals
130,SquigglyCrunch,Outstandingly Performed and Absolutely Haunting...with some Pacing Issues,9,3 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals follows a woman who, after receiving a manuscript of a novel written by her ex-husband, begins to read it and draws connections from the story to her own life. The performances are all outstanding in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing, further proving to the world why he's one of the best actors in the business, and begging the question of why he hasn't won an Oscar yet. Michael Shannon is great as well, pulling a both very serious and somewhat frightening role, while also adding a hint of comedy. While his character is something of a cliché, he has enough depth to him to make him believable and interesting. And somehow, through that he snags a lot of dark comedy out of it. But if you were to ask me, the best performance here is Aaron Taylor- Johnson. I've never seen him like this before, he fully gives himself to this performance. He's haunting, and makes for some of the best, and most disturbing, scenes in this movie. Even when he acts completely insane, he seems to believe it. His character absolutely believes, lives even, every single line of dialogue. Every single move he makes is just perfect. Each of these actors steal every scene their in, and they often share scenes. It's great. With actors like these, the movie proves hard to watch on multiple occasions, and it creates genuine feelings of dread or anger on the part of the audience. When a movie manages to get the audience that invested, you know it's done something right. The writing is great. The way the story moves and progresses is both realistic and engaging. The movie knows that the portions from the manuscript itself are more interesting than the parts with the ex- wife, and as such most of the movie is consumed by the manuscript. The symbolic imagery is really good too. It used images or scenes to connect other scenes or situations, then continues to build on the connection and symbolism through that. And it's not like it's convoluted or hard to figure out, it's rather simple actually, and yet it's very clever. Amy Adams stars in this movie, more as a supporting character, and she was sort of off and on. Considering how few her scenes were, it was somewhat hard to develop her character, and by the end the audience really hadn't learned much about who she was and she really wasn't given the chance to blow any of us away. This isn't a bad performance by her, it's pretty average by her standards actually. If you were to ask me what her best 2016 performance was I would absolutely say it was 'Arrival', but for what her role was, she did a good job here too. Despite the horror and intrigue presented by this film, it does tend the drag from time to time. While the out-of-manuscript moments are necessary to make the movie deeper, they're also a lot slower and an unappreciated break from a thrilling story. This is where it gets kind of confusing for me, because if the movie didn't have these out-of-manuscript moments it wouldn't be as layered, whereas if it keeps these moments the pacing suffers. It really comes down to which I'd prefer, and I think I'd rather yawn a couple times than lose depth. Overall Nocturnal Animals is fantastic. The acting, the writing, the plot, the layers, and even the comedy are all outstanding. It suffers from pacing, but it's a worthy sacrifice. In the end I would highly recommend this movie and I can't wait to see it again.",Nocturnal Animals
131,ronakkotian,Ford introduces a unique way of communicating a relationship.,9,26 February 2021,"I couldn't believe Tom Ford, as in fashion designer Tom Ford, made this film. Never would I have thought he would make movies but now I hope he makes more in the future.Nocturnal Animals follows Susan, a wealthy art gallery owner, who receives her ex-husband's new novel titled 'Nocturnal Animals'. As she begins reading it, she notices the similarities between the novel and their relationship.Nocturnal Animals is one of the more interesting dramas I've seen in a while. It's been a few weeks since I've seen it and have been thinking about it ever since. The film is based on a novel and is essentially three stories in one that all relate to each other in conveying the relationship between Susan and her ex-husband. What Tom Ford has pulled off here is terrific. There are many subtle hints and symbolism hidden throughout to link each of the stories in order to get the full picture of the relationship between these two. There are a couple moments where Ford literally spells out the themes which I didn't like but apart from that I think the rest of the film is fantastic. This is a very unique way of communicating a relationship to the audience and I feel, with each rewatch, there will more clues to pick up on in order to grasp the personalities and feelings of these characters. The film looks gorgeous and the camerawork is excellent all the way through. There are some well executed moments of tension where each actor gives it their all.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a strong and emotional performance. There is so much emotional range required for his role and he conveys it beautifully. Amy Adams is great in every single film I've seen with her in it and she's really good here as well. A lot of feelings are conveyed by her eyes and expressions which say so much about her character. Michael Shannon is awesome here. Not only is his character entertaining to watch but Shannon plays it incredibly well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives his best performance here in my opinion. He conveys the disgusting and vile nature of Ray Marcus brilliantly. There are countless scenes where he well and truly shines.Nocturnal Animals has been on my mind for quite some time now. The amazing acting, brilliant direction from Tom Ford, the story and the characters involved make Nocturnal Animals a thought-provoking watch that I feel will only get better on multiple viewings.",Nocturnal Animals
132,rubenm,Masterpiece from a true film designer,8,23 January 2017,"When a fashion designer like Tom Ford becomes a director, should we call him a film designer? In a certain way, his films look as if they are designed rather than directed. Like his first feature film, 'A Single Man', this follow-up is the ultimate manifestation of good taste. Clothing, interior design, art, lighting, music, even the cars: it's all carefully chosen and selected. Ford creates his own world of elegance and harmony, in which not a single element is ugly or out of place. And even when something ugly turns up, it is made into an aesthetic statement, as the hilarious and quite daring opening scene proves.In 'Nocturnal Animals', this seemingly perfect world is inhabited by rich art dealer Susan. Although she has no reason to be unhappy, she is. And she has herself to blame for it. In the course of the film, we learn what the reason is for her unhappiness: she feels empty after having made a crucial decision she now seems to regret.This reality is coming back to haunt her, when she receives a novel by post, written by her ex-husband. While she reads the book and gets gradually more upset by its content, the viewer reads it together with her. Not in text, but in images: the book is the screenplay for a film-in-the film. Susan's urban, elegant world of well-behaved, civilized people contrasts sharply with the raw, indiscriminate violence in the Texan desert, described in the book.The film-in-the-film is a neo-western, complete with hostile rednecks, a Stetson-wearing sheriff, and a landscape of endless two-lane highways crossing the emptiness. The first scene of this subplot is nothing more than perfect in its bleak agony.The frequent switches between the real world and the book story add extra depth to the film. This is enhanced when a third perspective is introduced: flashbacks from the time Susan and her ex-husband met and fell in love. Ford weaves the three stories together without any effort, and at any moment it's clear which perspective we're in.The result is a thriller with an extra layer of psychological drama, all shown in wonderful, beautiful cinematography. But 'Nocturnal Animals' is not an empty, cold, display of style. Quite on the contrary. Tom Ford almost condemns the emptiness of Susan's art world, full of hypocrites and devoid of real emotions. He shows how real feelings are much more important than pretense, that failure and dissent are to be preferred over perfection and harmony. It's almost as if he got fed up with the flashy fashion world, and chose a much more profound way of expressing his art.",Nocturnal Animals
133,davidgee,Style plus substance,8,9 November 2016,"Seven years after A SINGLE MAN Tom Ford has directed another offbeat movie, adapted by him from a fairly off-the-wall novel. Amy Adams plays NYC art gallery owner Susan whose ex-husband Edward has just published a novel that she reads as an acid attack on her. The word REVENGE is spelled out in one of Susan's paintings, so we know where she's coming from. Edward's novel, visualised for the audience, features the violent outcome of a highway breakdown for Tony and his wife and daughter. Jake Gyllenhaal plays both Edward and Tony, although in the desert scenes his wife is played by Isla Fisher, not Ms Adams.The movie switches from the Susan scenes to the desert drama without confusion for the viewer. The violence is very graphic and reminded me of the Toby Jones version of Capote's In Cold Blood, which I watched again recently. As in A SINGLE MAN, fashionista Tom Ford directs for Style as much as Substance: the camera hovers on the details of decor both in Manhattan and in the desert; it also lingers on the faces and bodies of the actors. Gyllenhaal has rarely acted (or looked) better. Rather like Julianne Moore in the earlier movie, Amy Adams is unsympathetically presented: it's Jake who's as much the victim as his alter ego's family. This is a dark and disturbing movie, intelligently scripted and powerfully directed.",Nocturnal Animals
134,andrewroy-04316,"While sleek and stylish, Nocturnal Animals doesn't reach the depth it shoots for",6,28 November 2018,"I was so ready to love this movie. A dark, intense thriller starring Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal - what could be better? While the parallels between book and character lives do leave you with something to consider, I did find it to overall be more pseudo-intellectual than actually clever. The story-inside-a-story idea is clearly tough to pull off, and Ford just doesn't manage to develop either cleanly. We never get enough to be invested in Susan at all, as all we really see are her reflections of herself and a few past experiences. The book plot was tense and atmospheric, but I disliked Ford's constant need to pull us back and remind us that this is all through the eyes of Susan. Plenty of the real world scenes didn't tell us anything and just reinforced the high class, artistic setting. The connection between their lives and the story does add something to the movie - Edward thinking their relationship is going well and then it starts slipping away as he doesn't know how to stop it. Trying to manage two plots and flesh them both out proves to be too difficult a task, and we end up with a satisfying Western thriller that we get repeatedly pulled out of to see the reaction of a regretful woman who never really does anything. The ambiguity of the ending is, emblematically of the movie, thought-provoking and well shot but doesn't really bring anything home or back to the audience. Shannon is great, and I will never cease to love Gyllenhaal's range, but while it had plenty of subtext and symbolism, there wasn't enough substance for me to really ever get into it.",Nocturnal Animals

I just expected an average thriller-drama story, but the movie ending was simply amazing. The best movie ending I watched lately. Very emotional and dramatic. I am a big movie fan, but sometimes a movie, surprise me, as this one. It is the perfect ending for a really nice acting story line. Also, well executed script and superb cast. Love it, or not. I love it.",Nocturnal Animals
136,PyroSikTh,Desperately Wants to Say Something,8,4 November 2016,"Susan is a middle-aged art dealer with a handsome, rich husband who wallows in her upmarket LA home, unhappy and unfulfilled with her lot in life. She's sent a manuscript for a novel out of the blue from her ex-husband she hasn't spoken to in twenty years, causing her to look back and reflect on their relationship. The novel looks at Tony (who Susan imagines to be her ex-husband) who seeks revenge after the abduction, rape, and murder of his wife and daughter in dusty West Texas. I've read some ideas on how the novel connects to Susan, but I'm at a loss. Is the novel a form of revenge on Susan? I didn't get that impression at all.Regret. Regret is what Nocturnal Animals is all about. Tony's regret over his inability to protect his family is what drives him to exact revenge. This sense of cultural masculinity permeates the whole movie, mirrored in Susan's flashbacks of her relationship with Edward, as he is deemed 'weak' again and again (in the same way Tony is accused of having a vagina). The power and intensity of the manuscript is what causes Susan to reflect on her relationship with Edward, and subsequently regret how it ended. She's older now, surrounded by money and style, but still feels unhappy because she pushed the one she truly loved away. Now she's all style with no substance.There's one thing I will say in Nocturnal Animals' narrative favour; it is intense. While Ford obviously prefers the slower more dramatic moments, the first act of the manuscript proves he's adept with suspense and action as well. Bordering on harrowing, Tony and his family suffer harassment unimaginable and befitting of a horror thriller, and Ray and his flunkies unpredictably flitter between charming and violently threatening. This sequence alone makes it easy to understand how and why the manuscript affects Susan so deeply, and we, the audience, are there gasping along with her. While the intensity dies down after this scene, it never truly goes away, rearing it's head every now and then as the movie progresses, both in the manuscript narrative, and Susan's own life.Visually, and unsurprisingly, Nocturnal Animals looks great. Every shot and scene looks meticulously composed, whether it's the minimalist style of Susan's expensive house, or the grimy interior of a trailer in the desert. And of course, considering Tom Ford's own area of expertise, the costuming is perfection. Susan's sense of fashion is modern and classy, complete with dead- straight hair over one shoulder and deep, dark lipsticks. Even her thick-rimmed glasses when she's out of the fashion-wear and engrossed in the manuscript scream of modern fashion. Thankfully this sense of high-art in clothing doesn't extend to the characters it should not. While Tony is depicted in open-collar shirts and handsome beard, Anders, the cop, and Ray, the redneck, are dressed more low-key and slack, reflecting the barren, dusty landscape around them.The acting is also top level quality, helping to make the eclectic cast of characters flourish. Amy Adams is great as Susan, showing a depth and sadness to her character that bubbles beneath the surface. Jake Gyllenhaal juggles both the roles of a young Edward and Susan's own idea of Tony, playing them both anguished and helpless. Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson chew up their sandy scenery as the terminally-ill cop and psychopathic redneck respectively, while various cameos from the likes of Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney, Isla Fisher, Jena Malone, and Andrea Riseborough prove that the supporting cast can keep up admirably.Nocturnal Animals is a movie I feel I need to watch again to fully understand the scope of what Tom Ford was going for. It's full of fantastic, if not controversial imagery (including the already infamous title credits of mature, overweight women dancing naked in slow-motion), and scenes of intensity that are sure to rock viewers to their core, but it also feels a little messy and confused as to what it's trying to get across. It's obvious there is something here trying to be heard, made all the more apparent to it's ambiguous and anti-climatic ending, but that is is buried too deep for me to make out. I give Nocturnal Animals a solid 8/10.",Nocturnal Animals
137,CineMuseFilms,a challenging psychological thriller about sexual transgression,8,6 November 2016,"It is hard to adequately describe the opening scenes of the psychological thriller Nocturnal Animals (2016) but you will not forget them quickly. Picture, if you will, images of completely naked and generously sized women writhing rhythmically to a heavy beat with various body parts moving simultaneously in different directions. They slowly progress in size, with lighting and makeup that makes them resemble what could be described as artistically grotesque burlesque, all with the opening credits still rolling in the background.If you are still watching, you are being prepared for a film that explores a twilight world of sexual transgression. It may help to know beforehand that there are three criss-crossing plot lines and you can easily lose your sense of what is happening. Gallery director Susan (Amy Adams) is an insomniac with a crumbling marriage and a disinterested career. Spoilt by wealth, she can indulge her sense of emptiness and her regrets over having cruelly dumped her first husband whose modest career as a writer was never going to meet her aspirations. Having once labelled him a loser, out of the blue he sends her a manuscript for a book she cannot stop reading.The dramatization of the book is a gripping stand-alone thriller. Formulaic but brilliantly acted and filmed, it is about a family driving on a deserted road at night who encounter a carload of crazed thugs. The driver is helpless as his wife and daughter endure horrific crimes, and the story becomes the quest for revenge or justice depending on your moral viewpoint. As Susan reads the book it triggers flashbacks about her previous marriage for which a flame still burns, and she begins to sense that the story is a vengeful metaphor for her own emotional and moral weakness. While these twin narrative layers twist and turn, Susan also struggles with her shallow life in the pretentious present tense of the Los Angeles art world.The narrative framework of this film can feel like a tangled mess but it is not. It shifts from one layer to another without warning to create a fine balance between logic and confusion while creating a powerful montage of haunting scenes. The converging motifs of sleeplessness and night trawlers equate Susan's culpability with those of murderous road stalkers and hint darkly that while some wrongs are beyond the law they are never beyond primal vengeance. The story of Nocturnal Animals is told through Susan's eyes and with a top-quality support ensemble. With striking cinematography, many scenes could be framed as artworks in Susan's gallery. This is a challenging and engaging film that says be careful what you wish for.",Nocturnal Animals

Amy Adams plays a woman who idealistically married beneath her. Her discarded husband writes a novel, which, although presented to us as a story within a story, is much more interesting than the tale which frames it, not least because the characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are a lot more compelling than the arty upper-class set that Ms Adams is part of. What terrible lives the rich lead. How they suffer. And if something nasty happens to them, how tragic it is.

140,avik-basu1889,A film that conquers your thoughts and refuses to leave your mind !!!,10,28 February 2017,"Fashion Designer Tom Ford ventured into the field of filmmaking with his debut film 'A Single Man' in 2009. 'A Single Man' was a well made, solid debut film which gave enough hints regarding Tom Ford's eye for cinematic storytelling and frame composition. But with his second film 'Nocturnal Animals', Ford has made it clear that he is one of the greatest artistic minds working in cinema today. This is a film of immense maturity, depth and intricacy. The script of 'Nocturnal Animals' written by Ford himself(based on the novel 'Tony and Susan' by Austin Wright) balances three separate narratives. Two of them in the 'real' world from two different timelines and the third being the narrative of the novel written by Edward. But the one overriding element is that all these narratives are being laid out in front of us from Susan's perspective. With the separate narratives appearing interspersed between each other, we slowly start seeing intricate elements and commonalities slipping from one narrative to the other which could be some literal object like a red sofa or it could a thematic similarity between characters. It sounds really complicated, but Ford succeeds in pulling it off with the utmost elegance without compromising with the thematic complexities.As Susan reads Edward's novel, she mentally starts finding some connections between some of the fictional violence in the novel and some events that occurred in their married life. This forces her to slip into a state of contemplation and self-reflection. There are two ways to look at this aspect of the film. First way is to accept that Edward's novel is genuinely connected to Susan and Edward's past life. With this interpretation, the theme that gets into focus is roots of or the motivations behind the art created by the artist. This shows that the fictional physical violence that appears in a work of art like a novel or a film might have its roots in immense depression or emotional pain suffered by the artist in his/her real life. This film shows that if you truly know the artist in real life, you can make connections between the fictional violence and the real violence no matter how deceptively camouflaged it may be. The second way to look at the film will be to believe that the connections between the novel appear in front of us mainly because the dramatisation of the novel is taking place from Susan's POV. She is bringing her own sensibilities and life experiences to the novel and interpreting it to mean something. We very commonly hear the phrase - 'this novel changed my life', 'or this film changed my life' - 'Nocturnal Animals' shows how the subjectivity of interpretation of a work of art can add a whole new dimension to a seemingly unrelated or unfamiliar artwork. Not only that, sometimes something like a painting which spoke to you in one way, might speak to you in a completely different way a few years later. Tom Ford also infuses the concept of how societal norms, customs and conventional expectations can shape the definitions of happiness, masculinity and marriage. Just like 'A Single Man', one can easily see Hitchcock's influence (especially 'Vertigo') on Tom Ford in the way he uses colour. The colour palette of the film with the intricate use of the blue and red hue on screen is used beautifully by Ford not just to separate the different narratives but also to express themes. I was also reminded of other directors like David Lynch because of the dream- like fluidity between the real and the fictional, the Coen brothers due to the gritty neo-western feel of the section with the novel narrative and also Kubrick, because of the meticulousness of the frame compositions. The film is also edited brilliantly with frequent transitions and shifts from one narrative to the next, sometimes on visual cue but with no element of confusion.The acting is brilliant from everyone involved. Michael Shannon is great as the no-nonsense world weary cop, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is almost unrecognisable and is really menacing. Jake Gyllenhaal is good too and Amy Adams' character gives the film some heart as she is the one who actually has an arc, an emotional one. 'Nocturnal Animals' is one of those films that will continue to linger in your thoughts for days due to its narrative and thematic complexities. It shows that Tom Ford is a creative powerhouse whose subsequent works I just can't wait for. Highly Recommended.",Nocturnal Animals

Perfectly cast and directed, this is an actual assault on the senses. Much like the poem ""Lady or the Tiger"" (by Frank Stockton), the viewer will have to figure out this movie--and that will not be easy.The story is about a well-to-do artist, wonderfully played by Amy Adams, who receives a manuscript from her 20-year divorced husband entitled ""Nocturnal Animals."" He wants her opinion because she once told him he had no talent. What then takes place is a story within a story. That's all I will reveal about the plot.From it's opening--one which you will not forget anytime soon--to the ending, this is pure character-based entertainment. The ending left me speechless and wanting more.Rated ""R"" for graphic nudity, language, rape, and violence, this was one heck of a ride.",Nocturnal Animals
142,Mike_Devine,The kind of thriller that doesn't let go,8,27 August 2017,"The sign of a great film is one that leaves you pondering things about it like ""what was the meaning of this?"" 'Nocturnal Animals' is one of those films, as its dual story lines and multiple metaphors provide enough material to consider long after the credits role.'Animals,' which is Tom Ford's second directorial effort, follows the life of Susan Morrow (Amy Adams,) an influential art director who's living a materialistic life in Los Angeles devoid of true happiness, cheating husband and all. One day, Susan is sent a manuscript of a novel Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), her ex-husband 19 years removed, has written. The novel, titled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" consumes Susan, and the deeper she gets into its pages - the events of which we get to see unfold on screen - the more she starts to re-evaluate her life and past choices.'Animals' is filmed beautifully. It's dark, yes, but in a way in which every scene is there by intention, not accident. The acting is top-notch, not just from Adams and Gyllenhaal, but key supporting actors like Michael Shannon, who plays a stereotypical west Texas deputy assigned to the case at the center of the novel's plot, to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the living definition of ""trailer trash"" and main antagonist. And the soundtrack is haunting, which is exactly what you'd expect for this kind of film.But again, it's the plot and its endless mysteries that make 'Animals' what it is. If you're expecting a typical Hollywood thriller that is more or less linear and wraps everything up in a nice package at the end, beware - this is not the case at all. There are enough parts of the film that could be over-analyzed that by the end you think you've earned a degree in psychology. And the double- meaning of the novel and how it contrasts with the real-life (non-)relationship between Susan and Edward is powerful. There has been much debate about the meaning of the final scene, as well, and clearly there is no right or wrong interpretation. Again, the sign of a great film.Sure, 'Nocturnal Animals' didn't find much of an audience in theaters. But quality cinema usually finds an audience one way or another, so it's a good bet the same will happen in this instance.",Nocturnal Animals

Writing this after a rewatch the quality of character and performance is amazing with the obvious standout being Jake Gyllenhaal. Cutting between the shell of an existence that's befell Amy Adams' character and Edward's brutal novel which reflects his pain following a major decision made in the characters relationship it's borderline artwork what unfolds.

When her ex-husband (Jake Gyllenhall) sends her a draft of his novel, all of the hardships of Susan's life seem to blend in with the violent novel and real life and fiction start to mysteriously intricate into one another.Having unfortunately not see stylist turned director Tom Ford's first feature ""A Single Man"" I did not know what to expect from the film, moreover I had hardly read anything about it, so my condition going in was that of a complete stranger to the material and it was glorious I did so because the experience I was graced with surprised me at every turn, ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a masterful thriller with a unique spin that manages to bring to the screen a concept that could have easily been a disaster.Tom Ford gives proof of himself as a masterful storyteller and in particular the visual storytelling going on in this film is brilliant. It is incredibly subtle, not hitting you over the head with its significance, it just stays in the background until the end when you realize what just happened and immediately go back with your head to the rest of the film and realize what it was doing to you subconsciously. It leaves you with images stuck in your mind and there is hardly a higher compliment for a film to have.Of course a lot of this is due to the brilliant work of Seamus McGarvey, a cinematographer that has been overlooked a little too much in my opinion, having always been one of my favorites. His photography always leaves me aghast, he manages to paint frames of immense beauty and uses colors to great effect into building the ambient of the story. He shoots night time sequences with a staggering detail and beautiful blacks, basically his photography just has a real weight to it and a grit that helps incredibly in making the picture hit the audience as it should.Still, the brilliance in the photography doesn't end there. We've talked about the quality of the image, but the quality of how the film is shot is even higher. Ford doesn't resort to ambitious camera moves or showy sequences, the picture is shot with very few setups for each scene, the shots are simple, but they are used to incredible effect: the frame is filled with significance and Ford holds on it to capture the audience into this world and when it is time to edit he always finds a creative solution that builds the tension throughout the whole picture. This film is a good reminder on how magical editing can be as the tools used are basic, but the moments in which they are used are intelligent.Still all of this wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the incredibly juicy characters this film has and how it decides to work with them. The intrigue is genius and it is built so that you are never sure of what is exactly going on, but you always have enough information so you don't get lost in it, it strikes that perfect balance and because of that it always keeps you guessing in suspense. The way in which the fictional novel is intertwined to real life and flashbacks is highly original and something that I have never had the pleasure to experience before.The cast is solid across the board, of course we are speaking of three of the best actors of their generation and each one of them manages to fit his place in the story perfectly without being showy went not required. Amy Adams is cast perfectly in this role and manages to fill her face the mystery that the film is exploring, giving the audience a true insight into her experience reading the novel. Yet, its Shannon that sticks out the most here, playing to the stereotype of his character perfectly and chewing the scene at every occasion, ending on a beautiful note.""Nocturnal Animals"" is a rich movie, it opens itself to many questions and even if it might not give the emotional pay off you wish you had, its mesmerizing images will be stuck in your head for days to come, with your thoughts wondering on every little detail to figure out what went down.",Nocturnal Animals
145,coreyjdenford,Unsettling sleep,8,4 November 2016,"This is my review of Nocturnal Animals (spoiler free)**** (4/5)SEVEN YEARS AGO former Gucci fashion designer turned writer/director Tom Ford graced the world with his powerful debut A Single Man a film which focused on the life of a troubled college teacher who lost his lover, a powerful debut that generously granted it's lead actor, Colin Firth with an Oscar nomination. They say that if you wait for a lengthy period of time with a beaded breath you will be rewarded with a miracle, well look no further as Ford's, latest and only his second feature Nocturnal Animals is a powerfully impressive and dark story, with impacting yet troubled characters and tour de force performances by the lead actors. Though style is an attribute this story does well and although it may be dark and have moments of being a heavily immersive film noir, with it's clever music style by composer Abel Korzeniowski and clever editing, this has a ton of style, it's fair to say that the seven years worth of waiting was worth it.Lifted from the darkly engrossing pages of Austin Wright's 1993 meta-novel Tony & Susan and adapted by Ford's cleverly immersive screenplay, the story of the movie focuses on Susan ( Amy Adams) a cynical, unmotivated gallery-owner/artist who sees her art as junk culture is living an idyllic lifestyle in her modest rural home on the outskirts of Los Angeles, with her handsome second husband (Armie Hammer) though her life is marred by his constant traveling, she suspects that he is cheating on her. She has no motivation left in her life, so she receives a manuscript in the mail; this story named Nocturnal Animals by Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) her grad-school lover and ex-husband who had always dreamed of becoming a published author, but didn't have any particular style of writing except for about himself, however Susan had not seen him for 19 years so when she receives his story she is in a state of shock. So she starts reading his dark story about his life. The novel's plot plays out on screen as Susan reads it – Gyllenhall taking yet another dual role for the second time after Denis Villeneuve's psychological thriller Enemy, by playing the role of Tony the book's protagonist (authors write about themselves so we're told) a man who has been living happily with his wife (Isla Fisher) and his daughter (Elle Bamber) in the beautiful rural desert land of the state of Texas – until he meets Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and their conversation is friendly at first but then he kidnaps the people the people Tony loves and ends up in a never ending and sometimes seemingly futile case, with Sheriff Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) and Tony goes into a desperate search for his wife and his daughter who went missing. He also plays the role of Edward the author of the powerful a man who was the grad-school lover and ex-husband of Susan - a man who dreamed of becoming a big-time published author but never found the right motives the two were a match made in heaven for a little while. Until she sees that life may not be right with him. Ford's transitions between in and out of the fictional narrative – and back and fourth between Susan's current life and the life he once shared with Edward – are wonderfully adept, as it adds some more style to the already seemingly endlessly stylish story; all the strands wrapping neatly around the body of the thesis like a well-tailored suit, as Ford did once design and tailor Daniel Craig's elegant three-piece Gucci suit for 2005s Casino Royale.While Tony is in a desperate yet sometimes futile search for the people who went missing from his life with the Sheriff, Susan is spending night after night reading Edward's powerful novel which has quite the hold on her as she is seen almost crying at it, she even tries to meet him at some point. While this story is going on the film also shows the life of Susan before she was a best-selling artist and Edward before he was a powerful author, as two young lovers just after grad school as they always agree with each other, or so it seems. Susan is actually starting to regret leaving Edward as she feels empty without him and she misses him dearly. Tony tries so hard to end the search and find a valuable source for the never ending case and as he finds one source he tries to find the leader, but he doesn't seem to remember until he is threatened with a loaded fire arm. The cast is impressive and there are some delightfully brilliant single scene turns from Michael Sheen, Laura Linney and Andrea Riseborough. However, some might find the premise of the film to be heartless or cold, but that assumption misses the point. The strong storytelling demands empathy not sympathy and, like Susan, a lot of us have all made severely bad choices. So what if her seemingly lonely fate doesn't bring a tear to the eye? Maybe it isn't meant to. Much like the art that Susan peddles, this is a piece of junk culture with an unapologetic pulp filling, that's masterfully and stylishly formed by Ford and expertly framed by brilliant cinematographer Seamus McGarvey. It's fair to say that this type of film is an intricate fit for Ford so just sit back and enjoy the ride, as best you can.VERDICT: An intense and stylishly exhilarating thriller, that's at some points unsettling. Ford's second feature is filled with immersive characters, a brilliant story within a story and tour de force performances – it was worth the long seven year wait.8/10 powerful",Nocturnal Animals

147,eagandersongil,I watch the nocturnal predator look at human weakness,9,9 February 2017,"""Night Animals"" has a charm that few will have the perception to notice, it's like a shell inside a shell, you have to open it twice, with good performances and great technical resources, with an initial credit scene that satirizes The American visceral way - although disconnected from the rest of the film - we have here a great work forgotten by the great awards. Contemplate the story of Susan (Amy Adams), who after a painful break with her husband 20 years ago finds herself thinking about him constantly, especially after receiving a manuscript of it. I do not think there is anything that can be claimed about the plot, because it uses more of the visual subjectivity than the script, the script is very self explanatory and even with only two hours of movies, it is enough to develop All the characters, we can even have a dubio ending that can make us question the quality of it, but after a little reflection, you will give up the questionings. The film has a moral that talks about the weakness of the human being, and weakness here is explored from all sides, from the physical to the spiritual, from the psychological to the emotional, all the characters at some point experience this weakness (I Talk more about it in the spoiler part), the film also contains several extremely cliché critiques of the American way of life and conservatism. The photograph of this film is simply beautiful, with lots of shades of blue and gray, it's a heavy, tense, loaded photograph, and as if it weighed on the shoulders of our characters, with daring camera angles, full of open plans and subjective cameras that Tom brings a lot of interesting angles, and now one thing about the film that touched me, and a lot, its soundtrack, it is so simple and at the same time so complex and linear, it talks a lot about the movie, and when the We are listening, it is almost an invitation to reflect on what is being shown on screen. We have 2 sensational actors here, who do what they expect in their roles - although nothing that animates much, although Jake is excellent - these actors are Amy Adams Jake Gylenhaa (who plays 2 different characters), but whoever ends up robbing the screen completely is Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, with their spectacular detective and psychopath. Finally, the film of the experimental Tom Ford completely divides the critical world out, but at least for me, the film is excellent for its simplicity, honesty, clarity and beauty as it deals with its themes. One of the things that divide criticism is its end, and the grace of this end, is that it can be millions of interpretations, that's the grace of the art, each one understood in a different way, for me, Jake's character only Wanted to show that that weak part of him no longer exists, he writes the book as a form of revenge on the abortion carried out by Susan, because the book talks about what he went through having lost his daughter, but in an extremely exaggerated way, we have All the stages, pain, suffering, repentance and acceptance, and at the end when Susan invites him to see him, he will not, because that guy who accepted the suffering caused by Susan dies along with his character in the book.",Nocturnal Animals
148,jtncsmistad,"""Nocturnal Animals"": Not as Wild about this Crew of Critters as Originally Reckoned",6,29 April 2017,"I finally watched a couple of the more notable films of last year over this past week, ""Manchester by the Sea"" and ""Nocturnal Animals"". I wasn't sure I even wanted to see the former. Now it is one of my all-time favorite movies. I did, however, believe that I would really enjoy the latter title. And I certainly didn't hate it. But neither did I like it to the degree personally anticipated.As was to be fully expected, co-leads Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal each deliver solid performances in ""Nocturnal Animals"". Their portrayals of estranged ex-spouses who may or may not reunite as a couple certainly succeeds in maintaining your interest until the end. Unfortunately, just not overabundantly so in this unusually presented tale of revenge by literature. That'll make sense if you've seen or plan to catch the flick.The consistently compelling Michael Shannon nearly manages to steal everyone's thunder here as a brusque, chain-smoking veteran West Texas lawman. His no-B.S. Bobby Andes chooses to go out not with a whimper but with a big ol' bang at the tail end of an all-consuming career. It is Shannon's luminous immersion in his colorfully quirky character that ultimately serves as a shining beacon upon this assorted cast of ""Nocturnal Animals"".",Nocturnal Animals
149,Med-Jasta,Contrived versus art,1,5 April 2020,"I'm sorry to say that art loses this fight. Contrived, pretentious and stilted to name a few words. This movie isn't genuine and is trying to be artsy. Which is really bad because all the actors are good and do a great job. Michael Shannon knocked it out the park. And each story line is good on it's own but we're left wondering what they have to do with the other. We know what she's reading but aren't sure if this happened or is going to happen or if this is her worse nightmare. And then the end is forced to make you think because the director sure as hell didn't think what it means. The IMDB explains the plot more than the actually movie does.Of course with the nature of a pretentious movie like this people will misinterpret confusion with genius, based on the fact that they don't understand it therefore the filmmakers must be smarter than they are. This is of course not true. Just like a giant blockbuster is playing to their crowd so is this movie to the artsy crowd. It's the same way of thinking they just use different tools.Don't let lack of talent be misinterpreted as genius.",Nocturnal Animals
150,disinterested_spectator,Ugly Art Is Still in Vogue,5,12 June 2017,"The twentieth century is when art became ugly. Oh, I'm not talking about the kind of art that philistines like me enjoy. I'm talking about that highbrow, elitist art consisting of ridiculous paintings, nonsense novels, discordant music, and weird foreign films. By the twenty-first century, the novelty of ugliness had begun to wear off a bit, but it can still be counted on to appeal to those who believe that an appreciation of ugliness is the mark of refinement.Nocturnal Animals is not a weird foreign film, of course, but it could pass for one. Right off the bat, the movie presents its highbrow bona fides by displaying disgustingly obese, naked women, dancing in place, in what turns out to be an art exhibit. The woman who has arranged all this is Susan (Amy Adams). Her life is as ugly as her art show, notwithstanding all the opulence in which she dwells. Her husband cheats on her. She can't sleep.She receives in the mail an unpublished novel from her ex-husband, Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). I don't suppose I have to tell you that it is an ugly novel. It is about a man named Tony, also played by Jake Gyllenhaal in Susan's mind as she reads the novel. Just in case we might wonder if she is projecting by making this identification between the author and the protagonist, there is an earlier discussion between Susan and Edward when they were married, presented in a flashback. She criticized something he wrote, telling him he needs to write about someone other than himself. He says all authors do that. They don't, of course. As Nietzsche once said, ""Homer would never have created an Achilles or Goethe a Faust, had Homer been an Achilles or Goethe a Faust."" But in this case, Edward has created a Tony because he is a Tony.Anyway, in this novel, Tony, his wife, and his daughter are traveling across west Texas when they are waylaid by a bunch of psychopathic punks. The movie wallows in the misery of a family being brutalized, resulting in the rape and murder of the two females. With the aid of a lawman named Andes, who is dying of lung cancer, Tony is able to track down the killers. Andes kills one of them, and Tony kills the other. However, the one Tony kills lives just long enough to hit Tony in the head with a poker, blinding him. Tony staggers outside, falls, and accidentally shoots himself, resulting in his death.In reading the novel, Susan is deeply moved, even more than she was moved by watching a bunch of naked, four-hundred-pound women jiggle their decaying flesh. Why is she moved? Well, it probably has to do with the abortion she had after Edward got her pregnant. She never meant for Edward to find out, but for some reason he just happens to show up at the abortion clinic just as she finished having it done. So, you see, the death of Tony's daughter corresponds to the death of Edward's aborted child. And the rape and murder of Tony's wife corresponds to Susan's infidelity, because turning Susan's voluntary lust and betrayal into a gangbang rape is Edward's imaginary revenge against her. And just as Edward knows that he is weak, Tony is too weak to save his wife and child.The death of Tony in the novel corresponds to Edward's suicide, the novel being one long suicide note, which basically says, ""You ruined my life by rejecting my love."" This is not made explicit, but it is obvious. When Susan emails Edward, saying she wants to see him, he emails her back, agreeing to meet. She goes to a restaurant, but Edward never shows up. Of course not. He's dead.For people like me, this is an ugly novel within an ugly movie. No wonder it got rave reviews.",Nocturnal Animals

153,Rendanlovell,Wonderful film,9,9 December 2016,"Tom Ford is one director that should be everyone's radar at this point. After his wonderful 'A Single Man' he has a new film for us. 'Nocturnal Animals' is a film that is unlike anything I have seen this year. It tells a simple story that manages to be incredibly compelling and engaging. Which are two things that you rarely get anymore. It's weird that such a simple story can be so engaging to watch, because I have seen this movie (or movies I guess) before. But the way that this film is told is everything. It centers around two main people. Amy Adams, who receives a manuscript from her ex- husband and Jake Gyllenhaal, who is obviously the ex-husband.The film tells the story of a story and how a person's life can directly impact their story. As we watch Amy Adams read and visualize the manuscript, parallels between reality and fiction begin to form. For me, this was easily the best part of the movie. As it cut back and forth between the real world and the book that Adams reads it becomes more and more clear that it's not just a story of fiction.What really sells this movie though is its genre-spanning nature. It shows us a simple middle age romance tale and a gritty west Texas thriller. These two things really shouldn't reasonably fit together. But the storytelling is what makes this movie sing. Both stories that it tells could be completely separate movies on their own. They may not work as well as they do when combined but in any other context, they would be two different movies. The first is about Adams who is just an unhappy person. She is struggling to find footing in her artistic career and in her relationship with her husband. When the manuscript arrives from her ex she begins to recall all the good and bad times they had together. And starts to feel the guilt of leaving him. The other story follows a man who watches as his family is abducted, helpless to do anything. He goes to the law and they begin to hunt for the people responsible. ​ Both stories are great in their own way but the Gyllenhaal and Shannon lead thriller is easily the most enjoyable to watch. Again, by itself, it's a rather mundane story. It follows popular tropes and clichés but what makes it better than most movies of this type is the characters. Shannon's Texas detective is incredibly fun to watch and Gyllenhaal as the broken father character gives an outstandingly emotional performance.Everyone involved in the film gives it their all really. They all seem to love the story and give it their best effort. But it also helps that we get a firm grasp on who these people all are. Whether fictional or real, each one has a distinct and memorable voice that drives the movie forward. Each one's actions lead to reactions and consequences fictional or otherwise. This is the driving force of the film.Watching as characters act and react to situations that ultimately affect the story. It makes every little detail feel heavy and important, as you aren't really sure what will come back to bite our characters. So, you are immediately more engaged in what is happening because there are stakes and consequences. And even though this isn't an intense film, it's packed with palpable tension. This stems, again, from the characters and the situations but also from the direction.Tom Ford composes beautiful shots that feel completely effortless. It's a stunning film filled to the brim with wonderful costumes, cinematography, sets, and makeup. The last of which came as a huge surprise. The makeup effects that the film utilizes make a noticeable difference to characters. It isn't just used to service the film but to service a scene. This use of makeup is something I have only seen in few movies. It can completely change how you think and feel in any particular scene.The only complaint I have is that the real world story sometimes steps on the toes of the fictional one. There are times when I was left just waiting to get back to the thriller. This makes a certain bit near the middle a bit tedious to sit through but other than that this film is a near masterpiece. It's incredibly well crafted in almost every way. It's beautifully shot, edited, performed, and is told with surety that a sophomore director just shouldn't have. It's an experience (and a ride) that will leave you thoroughly entertained and emotional satisfied.",Nocturnal Animals
154,themadmovieman,An exceptionally complex and enthralling film that deserves to be seen time and time again,9,26 December 2016,"This is an absolutely mesmerising film. Kicking off with an electric first act, it retains a brutal and totally bizarre atmosphere right up to the end, making for a hugely unnerving and completely unpredictable watch. With excellent performances, beautiful directing and amazing writing, Nocturnal Animals is an immensely intelligent film, and one that will keep you thinking at every moment.But before we get into the best parts of the movie, I think it's important to stress that this is the sort of film that will get better the more times you watch it. I've only seen it once, and it's pretty exceptional then, but there are so many fascinating twists and turns that change your perspective of earlier events, meaning that upon rewatching it, you can have a totally different and even more engrossing experience.That said, even on first viewing, Nocturnal Animals is a film that can be watched and interpreted in endless ways. Its structure is the key to why it's such an enigma, as we watch three stories unfold in a non-linear fashion. First, in the present, we have Amy Adams' character reading her ex-husband's story. Then there's the events that happen in the story, which take up the majority of the film's runtime. Thirdly, there are various flashbacks that recount Amy Adams' and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters' previous relationship, giving context to the unsettling feeling she is overcome by in the present.As a result, the film can be fiercely complex, and a real challenge for anyone to fully understand and pick apart on first viewing. However, I want to briefly talk about the three stories separately.By far the most engrossing and entertaining part of the film is the story that unfolds in the ex-husband's book. Kicking off with one of the most harrowing and distressing scenes I've seen in a long time, it continues to build as we watch Jake Gyllenhaal's character navigate his way through the aftermath of a horrific crime, turning into both a gritty and intense thriller as well as a fascinating and completely unpredictable mystery.It's pretty heavy-going as far as the graphic violence and raw emotion goes, but this is technically the simplest story of the movie, which you can watch and love even if you take it on face value.Then there's the story about Amy Adams' character in the present, reading the book. Her character is a strong-willed and quite intense art gallery owner, a side of her which we see on numerous occasions. However, the way that that's contrasted by some of her reactions to the book, and the subsequent reminiscing of her past relationship, is fascinating to see, something that Amy Adams pulls off brilliantly.As for the third part of the story, the flashbacks of the past relationship, it wasn't quite as fascinating and engrossing as the two other stories, particularly as I was so enthralled by the story in the book, however it does provide important context to understand present-day Amy Adams' emotions and actions, and would surely be far more intriguing when you rewatch the film.On the whole, the stories in the film are fascinating, and make for both an entertaining yet simultaneously terrifying watch. The overall story is incredibly brutal, both in terms of graphic violence and emotions, but it's almost intoxicating to watch unfold.Stories within a story are notoriously hard to pull off, and that's why Tom Ford, who both directed and wrote the screenplay for the film, deserves so much credit. Apart from giving Nocturnal Animals a bizarre and unnerving yet incredibly stylish vibe, the way he manages to balance the three parts of the overall story so well, with never a dull moment, and still make the film so confusing and complex right to the last moment, is exceptional, and possibly the best I've ever seen someone manage the feat.Ford's direction is incredibly memorable, bringing both an emotionally cold and intense vibe to different parts of the film, all the while tying together the three different stories in some very unique and interesting ways. He also manages to get some amazing performances out of the lead actors, mostly from Jake Gyllenhaal, who pulls off a stunning range from start to finish, but also from Amy Adams, who puts in yet another unorthodox performance, and even the film's supporting actors, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, both of whom are mesmerising to watch, making even the film's smaller characters utterly fascinating.Overall, Nocturnal Animals is a simply brilliant film. It's difficult, complex and confusing, and I certainly can't claim to have fully understood all of its ideas and themes on first viewing. However, its memorable, unique and intoxicating style made it an enthralling watch from start to finish, full of completely unpredictable twists and turns played across three different stories that are expertly brought together by Tom Ford to finish up with such a smooth, confident and unforgettable film.",Nocturnal Animals
155,kaptenvideo-89875,Living Well's the Best Revenge,9,29 January 2017,"That's some terrifying stuff right there! Fashion designer Tom Ford has written and directed his second movie, a multifaceted revenge thriller which is even better than his first, 2009's ""A Single Man"".Both are visually stylish, of course, which is expected from fashion guru, both have interesting premise and good actors, and both have this cold, unsettling atmosphere which tries to keep the viewer at some distance.In short, Ford has managed to take everything good from his solid debut project and bring it to the next level with ""Nocturnal Animals"". It's more lively, gripping, effortlessly cool and deeper. There are two stories, interwined in a way which may make viewers wonder whether it's real or imagined by the character. But it is ambiguous in a best possible way, not trying to f--k with our minds and then leave us hanging.An unhappily married woman (Amy Adams) thinks she wants his first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) back. And she reads his novel, a violent thriller, which seems like a revenge tale. And then things get more, er, complex.On-screen events are exciting already but Ford the writer turns out surprisingly skillful at making it even varied, without getting stuck or losing steam, or letting us think that we know where all this ends up. He even playfully takes jabs at his main fashion job and the lifestyle and personal sacrifices that come with it. And the whole result really makes you feel something for the characters, unlike many of the thrillers that only manage to arouse the viewer during their best bits.It's not mostly about Adams and Gyllenhaal. There is a number of smaller but important characters and cool performances. We have Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney.The cast is good enough reason to watch it. Everybody adds something worthwhile to the experience, even Sheen and Fisher and especially Linney who all have rather small roles used to move the story along. Shannon brings his usual magnetic mix of cool and creepy. Gyllenhaal manages to move between having balls and ball-less state without turning unbelievable or too heroic. Taylor-Johnson as the bad guy even got a Golden Globe for his work (the only one for the movie although Tom Ford got nominated for both best movie / drama and adapted screenplay). He really deserves it, he is evil at its most subtle and delicious. Delicious to watch, I mean.But I am especially happy about Amy Adams who is often used in the movies as just a pretty face or supporting woman. In 2016, she has had two strong roles, in a thinking man's sci-fi ""Arrival"", and now this. Her screen time may be limited but she surely makes the most of it, captivatingly playing out both worlds that the character has hiding inside her. I believed her both as a lively young woman and the jaded older one that's missing all the ideals that she had decided to throw away long time ago.Based on a novel by Austin Wright which Ford wanted to adapt into two movies initially, one true to original, the other not so much. I am not sure which way he chose ultimately but what a ride, eh?PS No, I am not giving 9 out of 10 to every movie I watch from now on. The last three have been just some of 2016's best of the best.",Nocturnal Animals
156,jb_campo,Slow start but strong finish,7,29 August 2017,"Nocturnal Animals started out with a very weird beginning and I thought, OK, this is going to be like Crying Game or Birdman - too artsy for mere mortals to follow. But once Amy Adams (Susan) got her package and started reading the book, this story grabs you and pulls you in.Susan is a famous art dealer who can't stand her job and can't believe people pay her to do what she does. She's useless, can't sleep, and in a meaningless relationship. With the story in a story technique, we learn that in grad school, she was married to Edward, an aspiring English major who dreamed of being a successful writer. We learn that Susan is from a rich background, somewhat spoiled, and somewhat afraid to take risks.Out of the blue, in her mundane daily life, a spark arrives in the form of a novel from Edward called Nocturnal Animals. We learn that this book and things in it have multiple ties to Susan and their past relationship. The book centers around a brutal, ripping event that takes place to a family traveling along the wilds of west Texas. Tony, the husband, is portrayed by Edward, and seems somewhat weak. His wife and daughter have definite similarities to Susan.Bad guys get involved and suddenly, there are multiple excellent flashbacks between current time, the story, and Susan and Edwards courtship and relationship. Excellently acted, excellently weaved together. I absolutely was riveted by Michael Shannon as this take no prisoners policeman Bobby Andes who is hard drinking, smoking, living type of Texas detective you might imagine.Detective Andes brings a focus of what should have been done to the story, and his strength counterplays against the weakness of Tony. His righteousness helps spur Tony to finally take matters into control, and highlights his terrible regret.Then flash forward to the present, and then the ending where we're left wondering about who really regrets what, and how people send messages about mistakes and choices.Nocturnal Animals would surely get higher ratings but for the silly beginning, and the pandering attitude to the whole art world. In the end, Susan lives in a world of phoniness at the same time as saying she's a realist, which brings out her true unhappiness. However, who will suffer more in this story - her, Edward, Tony, his family? who is who in the end. Less time spent on the art side, and more time spent on bringing out more of the book would have made this a masterpiece. As is, it's still a terrific story with great performances by Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal. Amy Adams was well, just OK, not outstanding. Really only at the end was she really given any scene to show acting skills. Otherwise, her role was a simple spoiled brat.Nocturnal Animals is not super violent, but it's not for the squeamish either - some tough subject matter. Enjoy,",Nocturnal Animals
157,trublu215,Tom Ford's latest is a good thriller that misses the marks of being great,6,20 November 2016,"Nocturnal Animals tells the story of Susan, a seemingly rich socialite with a dark past that is brought to light when she receives a copy of her ex-husband's new book. Noticing that the book is mysteriously dedicated to her, she begins to furiously read. The whole film is telling two stories. On one coin, we're being read the book. On the other coin, we're learning of Susan's relationship with her ex-husband. While I am usually all in for intricate films, this film misses the point of a story like this.The story is highly convoluted and becomes a bit more confusing than it has to be, all the way to the end. It was very frustrating to watch because (not surprisingly) the style and look of the film is very beautiful. Every shot is set up to expose meaning but it ends up looking and feeling more along the lines of style over substance. But no matter how much the story disappoints, the cast fires on all cylinders.Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon and Isla Fisher give phenomenal performances. Each of them are brilliant in their own unique ways, especially Amy Adams. I would be very surprised if she did not score an Oscar nomination (and maybe even a win) for this. Michael Shannon is also very good in this but, at this time in his career, you more so expect him to deliver perfection and this is no exception. The only performance that had me a little shaky was Aaron Taylor Johnson. Without giving too much away, he plays his role over the top and seems to try especially hard to be sinister to no avail.Overall, it's hard to recommend Nocturnal Animals to an average moviegoer. But if you're a fan of the technicals in film, then you'll appreciate the style that Ford shows here. The look and sleek feel of the frame emulates such films as Drive and Nightcrawler. If only the story was as good as its look, this could have easily been one of the year's finest.,",Nocturnal Animals
158,dallasryan,"A Rough Film, But a Great One",9,3 November 2016,"Susan is not happy with her life. She receives a novel from her first husband, Edward, and the film takes flight from there. Edward's novel is entitled Nocturnal Animals and it's a metaphor for what Susan put him through emotionally during their marriage, years ago. In his novel, Edward shows how masochistically he felt from his past life with Susan i.e. catching Susan with another man, Susan having an abortion with his child only to have another child with her now husband(Armie Hammer), the very man that she was cheating on Edward with during their marriage.Nocturnal Animals is a grueling movie that doesn't back off one moment as it will give the viewer an unsettling feeling all the way through. It's a brutal in your face movie of human lives and all of the emotions within our lives. The material is rough, but if you can take it, you're experiencing a fantastic film, an out of body experience of emotions. At times there is a little Funny Games type sadistic-masochistic circumstances going on, at other times Nocturnal Animals is funny and a lot of times it takes you on an emotional roller-coaster the same way Blue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines does.Nocturnal Animals is visually stunning and in some ways a visual breakthrough such as the beginning of the film(just kidding, but throughout the film there are some visual moments which feel like a breakthrough in film). Also, the director, Tom Ford, understands that a film is only as good as it's music score, and the music score is amazing in this one.Furthermore, I can guarantee you will never see an opening in a film quite like this one. It's pretty spectacular in fact. If you know the art scene then you know there are most definitely exhibits out there which mirror the one at the beginning of this film. Art is subjective. Anything can be art to the eye of the beholder.As art is subjective one can't really put a 'best' to it, but I will anyway, as in my opinion Jake Gyllenhaal will win the Oscar for Best Actor as Edward/Tony. Gyllenhaal is amazing in this film and it's long overdue for this fine actor. I believe Amy Adams, as Susan, will also win Best Actress for this film (or Arrival), she's a phenomenal actress and it's long overdue for her as well.Tony dies in the novel, and it's said sometimes that one has to 'die in order for there to be new growth.' Edward is Tony and he's telling Susan, through his novel, that his new growth is beginning as he's done with his old life, and the icing on the cake for him is to stand Susan up at the end of the film. Susan is ready for new growth as well, she's done with her life with her 2nd husband. It's a very sad scene to watch her sitting there all alone at the end. Perhaps the ending is human incarnate.This film will move you in the best and most difficult possible way and might even leave you thinking about your own life. Also, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are terrific as well as the entire cast. A job well done all the way around. Tom Ford has made his masterpiece. A must see film!",Nocturnal Animals

160,tributarystu,The Story Within the Story,6,21 November 2016,"Minor interpretation spoiler.Any follow-up to 'A Single Man' was bound to be challenging, with bar set so high. Expectations are a horrible thing to have. Ironically, Tom Ford puts together an intricate tale about exactly that: expectations and love and mistakes and payback. It is captivating thanks to the lead trio of Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon. It works visually in spite of the occasional clichés. But it's not an even story and the mediocre writing cannot be forgiven. Implicitly, Nocturnal Animals taints itself with the muck of pretentiousness. Yucky muck.Susan, unhappily wrapped in her glamorous life as director/board member of an art gallery, receives a manuscript from her ex-husband, Edward. It's a book about a family being assaulted on a lonely country road by a bunch of aggressive do-nothings. Susan begins to read it just as her own ideal marriage cracks at a distance and we are enveloped by the story within the story. One, in the cold and sterile home/life Susan has built for herself, the other in the violent, passionate, conflicted Western-ish decor of Edward's novel. The parallels between the two are as plentiful, as they are visceral. Which is the best thing that can be said about Nocturnal Animals.Amy Adams is such a strong presence on screen. She is particularly adept at portraying frailty, the kind that works as an undercurrent more than a dominating trait (see Arrival for even more nuance). Jake Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, atypically provides the 'weak' character, the dreamer, the one who is sensitive to a fault. It is in this study of what we might desire and how elusive it all is, how hard it is to find the right amount of something at any given time in another person that Nocturnal Animals strikes an honest chord. What carries the movie beyond the procedural 'catch-the-bad-guys' it sets up for itself, is an unpredictable, loose and enthralling Michael Shannon, who plays the law enforcement element. And Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't a half bad asshole either.The problem is there are several filler characters as well, such as some of the party faces (even if they were mightily familiar, i.e. Michael Sheen and Andrea Riseborough), Armie Hammer's role as the distant husband, or Laura Linney's domineering mother-figure. It's particularly a problem because, to me, they are the ones supposed to be the nocturnal animals, the predators. And in this commentary on a social divide, the movie falls short, because all it does is point caricatures of fingers at it. The uninspired writing, including some awful and pedantic dialogues, kept taking me out of where I wanted to be, enjoying the drama. And some fairly random scares did little to help with it either. The movie just can't strike a consistent tone, trying to be a lot of things at the same time and inevitably failing. So yes, I was disappointed. Tom Ford might not have undermined his stylistic approach, as he still manages to iron over the elements that don't work so well by applying his particular aesthetic. But if it were not for some of the performances on screen, it would be really hard to recommend Nocturnal Animals - which is pretty damning. Well, expectations and all considered.",Nocturnal Animals

162,MikesIDhasbeentaken,I get both sides of the reviews..,4,17 February 2017,"I get why some people are hating and others are loving this movie. big bucks were spent on it looking and sounding nice with good performances from everyone in it. Everything is really well done, and everything looks amazing about it. But... there is still the slight problem of it being an awful movie. Firstly, you know the novel will be a tale of revenge, of course he'll get revenge. And my first thought was, I bet he just shoots him, like in most American revenge movies, sure he's spent hours raping and torturing your family but a quick death after a shot or two in the heart while he's laughing as he reminisces about it is the type revenge you seek. So when exactly that inevitably happened I thought the one good thing about the story of the movie was ruined. As until then the storyline of the book was pretty good.The rest though, was just unnecessary to the extreme, even the premise of the movie is described as a woman who interprets the novel as a symbolic revenge tale, well his revenge is even worse than the one in the novel... he stands her up for a dinner date at an expensive restraint so she just drinks on her own... With a better ending, the novel story was actually good, some of it quite gritting, so i can't completely knock this, but the rest was so bad.. maybe it'll hit a chord for a few rich arty socialites, but for everyone else it's just a bit pants.",Nocturnal Animals
163,Aly200,A Stylish and Frightening Thriller,9,20 December 2016,"Tom Ford delivers a gripping and spine-chilling adaptation of Austin Wright's haunting novel with an all star cast of characters that will haunt you even after the credits roll. The story starts out simply as Amy Adams's Susan Morrow receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's first novel which has been dedicated to her. The novel (which is the film's title) tells the tale of married man (Jake Gyllenhaal in one of two roles) hellbent on revenge after a horrific crime. Susan soon finds her world thrown upside down as she becomes obsessed with delving further into the book and grows lost in thought over first marriage and the consequences she has had to pay. In the leading female role, Amy Adams is extremely subtle in her portrayal of Susan Morrow. The actress brings a haunted vulnerability hidden behind a veil of guilt to the part without ever going over-the-top or underplaying her emotions. Adams' chemistry in her brief scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal as her first husband, Edward, are executed well with flirting and nail-biting tension as the narrative progresses and Adams's chemistry with Armie Hammer as her second husband is also good though we don't get to know Hammer's character that well. Playing dual roles in this film is an exquisitely cast Jake Gyllenhaal as he plays in flashbacks Edward Sheffield, Amy Adams's Susan Morrow's ex-husband and the film's catalyst, and also plays the role of Tony Hastings, a fictional character within Edward's novel. Gyllenhaal is no stranger to playing two roles after portraying two characters in Denis Villenuve's ""Enemy"" in 2013 and here he displays how polished he is at handling dual roles. Playing Tony gives Jake the most chances to shine as we watch his struggle to deal with grief, rage and feelings of revenge after a tragedy befalls him and his family. In his brief time as Edward, Gyllenhaal displays an eager young man who is determined to prove himself to those around him particularly Adams's Susan. When he is wronged, we slowly unravel the lengths that Edward will go to make his point to Susan.The film's supporting cast including Michael Shannon as a lawman in the film's novel, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a juvenile delinquent and the aforementioned Armie Hammer as Amy Adams's character's current husband are all well suited for their parts. Shannon brings a grizzled edgy side to his role, Taylor-Johnson adds a raw, vicious and unpredictable wildness and Hammer brings his charm for his small part that they all leave marks on the events of the film.Under Tom Ford's direction and writing of the screenplay, the movie maintains an eerie vibe throughout and never lets go. We are never certain which direction the story will take as events spiral further and further into a tangled web of tragedy, deception and terror. Like Susan Morrow, the viewer becomes as engrossed in Edward's horrifying tale and wonder where it will go and what the ultimate outcome will be.Truly one of the best thrillers of the year and not to be missed.",Nocturnal Animals
164,rlaine,"Best movie I've seen in a good while, a classic masterpiece",9,10 September 2018,"This is a movie you wouldn't expect to see in this day and age, that's why some people may not understand or appreciate it. I didn't know what to expect and even I felt a bit confused in the end, there doesn't seem to be much of a resolution and the whole movie may feel a bit pointless, but after doing some thinking and reading other reviews I'm ready to say that this is a modern masterpiece. Superbly written and crafted in vein of Verhoeven (Basic Instinct), Fincher (The Game), Lynch (Lost Highway), Polanski (Chinatown) and even Hitchcock.The movie is about a rich ""bourgeois"" art gallerist Susan (Amy Adams) reading a book written by her more down to earth ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). Doesn't necessarily sound very interesting, but it is. I'm not going to open up the story deep down, it's been done very well in many other reviews, but I'm going to say tho that it's at the same time very subtle and symbolical as well as surprisingly straight story without twists that will blow your mind. It's very much a drama and a love story. I'm not even sure if you can call it a crime movie as the crimes all happen in the book she's reading. It's also Edwards story, as ""he only writes about himself"". The book Susan is reading makes up most of the movie tho and it's very intense crime thriller most of the time. But it's not so much about the book, but how it all reflects to Susans past life, which we also get to see in well placed flashbacks.This movie is clearly a homage to classic crime dramas of 50's to 90's. It's very similar in noir mood, gorgeous cinematography that uses a lot of long lenses, absolutely amazing orchestral soundtrack and great character driven story. The ending, which some have heavily criticised and which even I first thought was a bit unexpected, but after thinking about it, it's amazing and and absolutely one of the best endings I've seen in a while. I actually feel like watching the movie again and this time prepare for the ending to fully appreciate it.A modern classic in every way.",Nocturnal Animals
165,asifahsankhan,A pitch-dark thriller to make you nauseous with pressure and lament!,9,30 December 2016,"In the fictional but somewhat autobiographical book, 'Nocturnal Animals', Edward depicts a chilling story of manipulation, trauma and revenge. Tony's family is randomly attacked by young drifters led by Ray, who, as played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, appears as an unbearable maniac trying too hard to be stay calm. Thankfully, his performance is as atrocious as Michael Shannon's is delightful playing Officer Bobby Andes (probably the two best male characters). To fit in to this environment, Shannon understands that he has to be as crude and stereotypical as possible. Overblown as the blasé cowboy, not simply nihilistic but actually suicidal, Andes is the most believable character in this world of absurd violence, coming across as the written words that you can feel when passing your hand across the page.Tom Ford, designer turned film director, will never be forgiven by some for not being John Ford — a numinous natural rather than a Tommy-come-lately with talent. But Nocturnal Animals, his second feature after the modest but accomplished A Single Man, invokes a whole other John Ford anyway. The novel is about a woman, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), who is physically fruitful however sincerely unfilled. At the point when she's sent an original copy by her ex (Jake Gyllenhaal), telling a story of retaliation in the Texas betray, she thinks back on her previous life and stands up to the missteps she's made. At the point when a form architect swings to filmmaking, it appears the minimum we ought to anticipate that is for it will look like it. As it's demonstrated with Tom Ford. His presentation highlight, A Single Man, figured out how to discover magnificence in the base of a sock draw, and this, his second, which he adjusted from Austin Wright's novel Tony and Susan, looks likewise perfect. The man is a craftsman, without a doubt. Some may discover the film merciless or frosty, however solid narrating requests compassion not sensitivity. As it happens, so too is his film's focal character, Susan, however she has racked her inventive drive to deal with a LA exhibition. The film opens with her most recent show — a festival of hefty, wobbling, stripped tissue. It is unattractive substance strikingly showed. We come to understand that workmanship mirrors life for Susan, whose ostensibly lovely presence is entirely revolting, containing a dismal marriage to a philandering spouse (Armie Hammer), a vocation she no longer likes — she loses faith in regards to the garbage culture that invades her reality — and a self-manufactured, soul-squashing blame. That blame relates to her first spouse, Edward (Gyllenhaal), an essayist whom she betrayed in a savage way two decades prior. He was excessively powerless. She needed somebody more grounded. Be that as it may, Edward has now completed his introduction novel, which he devotes to Susan and to whom he sends a proof. As she peruses his original copy — a mash Texas story of brutality got and responded — she sees the conspicuous parallels between the ""fiction"" and her activities, her feelings get a kicking and Edward, as a result, gets his greatly tardy requital. Discuss a dish served icy. The novel's plot likewise plays out on screen as she peruses — Gyllenhaal playing a double part by additionally playing Tony, the book's hero (writers expound on themselves, we're told). Passage's moves all through this anecdotal story — and forward and backward between Susan's present life, and the one she once imparted to Edward — are brilliantly capable, every one of the strands wrapping conveniently around the body of his postulation like an all around custom fitted suit. The cast is noteworthy and there are delightfully wicked single- scene turns from Laura Linney, Michael Sheen and Andrea Riseborough. Some may discover the film merciless or chilly, however that overlooks what's really important. Solid narrating requests compassion not sensitivity and, as Susan, we've all settled on awful options. So consider the possibility that her desolate destiny doesn't convey a tear to the eye. Perhaps it's not intended to. Like the craftsmanship that Susan sells, this is a bit of garbage culture with an unashamed mash filling, wonderfully shaped by Ford and expertly encircled by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey. Kick back and appreciate the ride.",Nocturnal Animals
166,FelipeCarrillo,"Ford's Acute Thriller Concerns You, Affects You and Transmutes You",9,23 December 2016,"Who do need Liam Neeson's and Uma Thurman's vindications when we own the ""Nocturnal Animals"" of Tom Ford?Former Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent Creative Director, nowadays, this Texan man is a glorified fashion designer and promptly also of arts audiovisual. His magnum opus (""A Single Man"") in film world was reminiscent of emotional privacy that may be movies, a stoic and ineffable progression self-absorbed in the visual and subjective. Although it was highly exalted between the critic circle, no one predicted that the second disquisition of neophyte director would be an instant masterpiece. The vogue of his rarefied career resides in fussy concern about detail and aesthetic accuracy by high levels of tastefulness and originality. As dedicated supporter of doctrinal pragmatism, his eminent diplomacy in stroke and gesture is transferred with the same refinement and subtlety to his second project, in which not only continues exhuming his critical eye on the organic, also demonstrates his sole literary faculties with an almighty and poetic screenplay of bitterness, treachery, evocations, hoaxes and superficialities. The seven years out weren't due to a bad primary experience or a cinematic absenteeism, but to that inherent thoroughness that taking him too far.""Nocturnal Animals"", discretionally based on the novel ""Tony & Susan"" by Austin Wright, presents a narrative structuring in three underlying and sharp rhetorical levels, where the important isn't its specific nature, but interpolation between them through homologous syntactic and artistic components. The first platform and central axis of the celluloid is the paramount film basis, which shuts us away into Susan Morrow's life, a dejected gallery owner belonging to American high society of New York, a forlorn and troubled wealthy woman experiencing a marital crisis and a crestfallen course of life. Among the off- white walls and architectural stairs in the gallery, the director works with acidity his stylistic facet, heterogeneous allegories in anti- heroine's attire and accessories set the ostensible sublimation, very symmetrical and methodical. A sinister but impregnable, obscure but neat, fateful but fascinating scenery; epicurean constructions with extreme creative exquisiteness in where the leading role drag her feet in onerous heels, blackening with ill-fated and deaf footprints of unhappiness, sorrow and need for change. Subliminally, the director lays the foundation with dry and plaster tones, where emphasize the dominating black, effigy of secrecy in characters. Scenic beauty, the magnificence of the costumes, architectural refinement, and passionate exaltation are possible thanks to a stolid Amy Adams, a great role confront subsequently with other reputed acting queens.Edward, her ex-husband, makes contact after 19 years by means of a written document, where is located the manuscript of a book dedicated to her name because she was the promoter for unearthing the hidden mastery. Nonplussed, she assimilates the attached note where he exhorts her to read it. Since then, the intoxicating course prelude, without realizing the violent transfiguration is about to start. Thereon, the uncertainty is going to take a diametrical turn since not just we sink ourselves in an entirely divergent fiction from omniscient and frontispiece point of view, but we immerse into a partial perspective, where Adams' character moves to the involuntary narrator of the second story, which captures the absolute protagonist. A fictional story into another one. It is here where we certify Tom Ford's lavish direction, where the syntactic and aesthetic register is strictly transmuted. Although night atmosphere still dominates, fluctuation of ethereal patterns feels, the aura goes from misfortune and grief to torment and nullity, that measured conversion alluded to the participation of a figurative second director. Ford ascribed himself as undivided craftsman, sublimating the fictional story within the meta-narrative with as distinction and purity as authenticity and effectiveness. It isn't about building an autocratic story, is about the corollaries that this engenders in Susan in every turnover of the page, folio in which is located the feelings that her ex-husband seeks to proclaim, with determined voice, fused in an extravagantly opposite outlook. It's here where Ford says goodbye to the faithful adaptation of the novel base, it's here where his intellectual aptitudes stand out by its multiplicity. A yarn violating a Texan's virility and demolishing the single hegemonic pillar, a male who is at the gates of hell, a fellow dying by the misfortune, impotence, and revenge. He based his foundations in retaliations. Each chapter of the meta-narrative amalgamates in Susan's life, and it externalizes the effects condensing into her unconscious, gradually capturing the frank direction of misfortune. Despite we are aware of the metamorphosis in her, the meta-narrative is who reins in the movie with its phenomenal performances, its foreseen but disturbing plot twists, the illustrious consummation and its histrionic and harmonious property in each frame.Finally, we find preterite level formed by the flashbacks. These external analepses focused their designs on relating us with retrospective conjunctions having an impact on the writing of certain paragraph, one pick to understand the sub-text. After the manuscript has been finished, we contemplate the far-reaching consequences of the stories in its characters, which have symbolically similar conclusions. She is there, totally converted by the light revival of returning to rebuild her past, with an ointment drastically scathing, expectant, noticing until the last second that the protagonist of the book was her authentic silhouette, which provoked all this with an innocuous word, 'weak'. An intricate film ostensibly neo-noir, in where the cardinal thing isn't to unify a level and the other one, it's understanding the semantic as a whole. Nothing will be easy or unmotivated in this intense trip of revenge, in where each interspersed scene has crucial effects in the protagonists. A critical anagnorisis which must be framed, lauded and deified. Tom Ford has established himself as a postmodern film hero because he corroborates that you and I are lethal nocturnal animals.",Nocturnal Animals
167,TheVictoriousV,As intoxicating as it is clever; beautiful.,9,15 April 2019,"Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals (adapted from the novel Tony and Susan by Austin Wright) is the kind of film that's great enough when you experience it, but gets even better when you think about it afterwards. Having seen it, I feel a second viewing may be rewarding if you want to understand it fully and sufficiently appreciate all the subtle touches of its presentation. My third viewing will simply be because I loved it.Nocturnal Animals tells its story through several layers. Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a Los Angeles-based artist with her own gallery and a wealthy spouse with more looks than personality (Armie Hammer, as it were). A package reaches her office one day, sent by her ex-husband, a struggling writer named Edward Sheffield, containing a first draft of his first proper novel. For whatever reason, he has dedicated this thriller to Susan, even using his old nickname for her as its title - a ""nocturnal animal"", he would call her.The book opens on Tony Hastings (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as he is driving through the Texas desert by night with his wife and child (Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber). They have an increasingly nasty encounter with a bunch of redneck types, bossed around by the utterly unhinged Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson in what must be the greatest performance he will ever give). He and his goons first pry Tony off the road with their vehicle, and then offer to change one of his busted tires for him in what Glenn Kenny referred to as ""one of the most discomfortingly suspenseful sequences in a Hollywood film since Blue Velvet"". The fact that it achieves this in spite of being (we assume) in-Universe fiction speaks volumes about Ford's abilities as a filmmaker, not to mention the performances.The altercation ends with Tony being separated from his family and left on his own in the middle of the desert. He manages to make his way to a small town and enlist the help Detective Bobby Andes (a stupendously entertaining Michael Shannon) to track down Marcus and his crew, but he soon finds out that there isn't a happy end to this tale as the tale itself turns into one of cold revenge. Outside of said tale, more side characters exist, such as Susan's disapproving mother played by Laura Linney, an artsy fashion disaster played by Jena Malone, and Zawe Ashton as a colleague of Susan's who is too young to relate to Susan's sudden feelings of having wasted her life.In addition to the scenes set ""in reality"" and the parts that take place in Edward's story, flashbacks from Edward and Susan's time together start to appear as soon as Susan begins reading. There are numerous visual parallels between the narratives, which speaks to a larger thematic connection between the story of Tony and that of Edward's history with Susan. Some of the scenes also involve shifts in tone and style - even genre - but it his handled with such prodigious skill that it never once feels jarring.One of the most remarkable scenes in this movie, however, is its opening sequence, wherein a collection of nude, insanely overweight women are dancing seductively in slow-motion as a beautiful score plays and confetti rains over them. This is, of course, a part of Susan's art installation, but its effect is very much felt by observers outside of the film's universe. When we exited the theater, my brother wondered if this intro was meant to be a straightforward defiance of societal beauty norms or if it was rather a critique on ""feminist propaganda"" (the latter of which would have been more to his liking) and thus probably also a critique on provocative artists like Susan. Whatever the intent, I can admit to being mildly put off and befuddled at first, but quickly began to marvel at how visible uncomfortable all the other attendees at the screening were. In a strange way I admired it, and I knew the tone was set for the impending experience.The film is also so delicate and meticulous in the way it looks. From all the subtleties in Amy Adams' no less than Oscar-worthy performance to the clothes that her character chooses to wear at a given moment (Need I mention that Tom Ford is a fashion designer?), the character of Susan Morrow alone is the result of intricate, grade A craftsmanship. Her co-stars are at least equally resplendent, and they are shot and lit with the grace of someone who truly knows a thing or two about eye-pleasing aesthetics. Some of the scenes set within Edward's book do come off as a bit amateurish, but I feel as if there's purpose behind it.Nocturnal Animals is precise, beautiful, oftentimes shocking, briefly funny at the right times (thanks in no small part to Taylor-Johnson and Shannon), wonderfully depressing, and told to us with intricacy and cleverness. Its ""story-within-a-story plus something else"" structure made me think of Aronofsky's The Fountain, but I have a feeling more people will appreciate how it's done by Tom Ford.",Nocturnal Animals
168,Gresh854,"One Seriously Messed Up, Disgusting, Masterpiece",8,21 November 2016,"I had to take a couple days to process this movie. From the opening shot of this film you can already predict on what kind of film ""Nocturnal Animals"" is going to be. Now a forward warning for people who plan on seeing this movie, this is an extremely hard to watch film. No spoilers of course but the first scene in the movie is a bit hard to watch and some of the people I went to watch the movie wanted to walk out of the theater at that moment. If you don't like watching movies with hard to watch imagery and really tough subject matters, I would not recommend seeing this. But for people who really want to see a pretty much, perfectly directed art-film that will get under your skin, ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a must see. I like to describe this movie as a mix of ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""Gone Girl,"" and surprisingly I found myself enjoying this film just as much as I enjoyed those two films. Right off the bat, all the performances in the film are fantastic. The stand out performances for me was for sure Jake Gyllenhaal (who really needs to be nominated for an Oscar by now), Amy Adams, and surprisingly Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who gave a really convincing performance that was very chilling. But my favorite aspect about this film for sure has to be the direction. This film is suspenseful as hell. And the imagery is beautiful and there isn't a scene in this film where I felt bored even though the film is slow paced. Sometimes slow pace can work and sometimes it can't and in this case it definitely work. I most certainly also have to tell you, that this film is so unique. I'll just say for the sake of no spoilers, that there are two stories within' this movie that each have similar connections that really play off a strong theme in the movie that in the end really makes you think. This film makes you think about hard and terrible events that happen in the world today and they really make you process the themes behind them. Overall guys Nocturnal Animals blew me away. This is by far one of the best movies of the year, it's definitely my favorite mystery, drama of the year, and if you're into powerful, intense thrillers that are artsy but not over the top artsy, I think you'll love Nocturnal Animals like I did. For me, overall, Nocturnal Animals gets a score of 10/10 and a grade of an A+.",Nocturnal Animals
169,carlos37andre,"A film with ambition, but that fails to execute.",6,22 February 2017,"The story of ""Night Animals"" has potential, with actors very well directed in their roles, the film has many elements that a great film needs, but its history does not convince much.Basically (without spoilers), we have the story ""divided"" into two narratives, with a ""staging"" of a book, which is read by the protagonist, and the story itself in the ""real world."" The premise itself is very good, but execution is not competent.It takes some time for the viewer to begin to understand the real purpose of the story of the book, and yet it continues to look largely unhelpful to the overall plot, though excellent if analyzed in isolation.With all of that, the fictional book story is still the coolest part of the movie, ignoring the connections to the real world, the story of revenge and hatred surrounds, and makes you want to see more of each scene.But the real world does not have that much appeal.In addition to these mistakes, the film tries in several moments to be more than it really is, abusing the references to itself, metalanguage, and etc, in a very pretentious way. An example of a super- unnecessary scene is the opening sequence, with super-nudity played, and that means NOTHING to the rest of the movie, it just seems to be there to say ""we're radical, we started our movie with a non-standard nudity.""But not everything is negative, worth the highlight for the work of actors in the film. Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, are very well and especially Jack Gyllenhaal and Aaron-Johnson Taylor, with excellent performances in their roles.In summary: Nocturnal Animals is not a bad movie, but fails to hit its line of thought, and at several moments thinks it is much more than it really is, which leaves production with an ""arrogance"" that somehow, You realize your faults more than your hits. Other than that, the film has very well written dialogues, one of its extremely immersive narrative nuclei, and a cast in excellent shape. Maybe it was worth seeing.",Nocturnal Animals

172,PetarNeo,Probably most interesting movie of the year,9,1 December 2016,"Movie is a story within a story with flashbacks to her earlier life, as Susan is reading book that her ex husband Edward sent her she experiences a series of events. This picture is one of the most intriguing stories ever made and it just puts a lot of details and raises questioning on larger scale. As the story goes and how deeper Susan gets into the book and details of it, book story just takes over and was incredibly dark and painful but also very interesting. Inside the book Tony has lost his whole family and now in all that pain he and Detective Andes are trying to find killers. That story becomes so fascinating and dark that it starts to feel like you don't care about real things anymore but only what will happen with Tony. Susan finds out that her husband is cheating her and she feels hurt so she wants to meet with Edward. Now we are shown some of her past and how she hurt Edward so badly. On the other side Andes and Tony got killers and scenes were so tense and so powerful but filled with darkness that it was so great. Finally in all that Andes killed one guys and the other was killed by Tony but after he has been hit with pole and goes out of cabin wandering around falls down and accidentally kills himself. As Susan has arrived in place where she's supposed to meed with Edward, he never shows up and movie is ending with her in restaurant. There could be so many connections between two stories and a lot of metaphors that it just blows mind and if you take for instance that Edward said that he always writes about himself it's biggest possibility. Also there is so many options left and some of the things that were unexplained even sometimes absurd. Amy Adams played Susan and she was brilliant, showing us how she made mistakes and regret but also her will for forgiveness and she is vulnerable. Jake Gyllenhaal was in roles of Edward/Tony and he was spectacular specially in role of Tony where he lost everything and now is dealing with grief and pain but also seeks justice and he doesn't matter how it's done and shows us how certain things can change people. Michael Shannon played Andes and it's one of the most disturbing, dark but also strong and powerful characters ever played and he was so great that almost every scene where he's in goes to him. 3.5/4",Nocturnal Animals
173,Lewis_Heather787,An extraordinary experience!,10,5 November 2016,"With a fantastic cast and trailer, I was pretty interested and curious in seeing how this film would play out. However I had no idea what I was letting myself in to with this amazing masterpiece of a film that has truly blown me away. Firstly the director Tom Ford, who did a truly amazing job with the directing in this film. The camera work and shots in this film are new, interesting, different and a breath of fresh air. From a ""part time"" film maker this is extraordinary work and something that should be championed, what a fantastic talent this man is. The shots varied straight from the opening of the film from shocking visuals and images to more simplistic backgrounds that we all take for granted in our day to day lives. The combination of striking and simplistic works so perfectly in this film and is a testament to Tom Ford and introduces us to his style. Next the cinematography by Seamus McGarvey, is absolutely some of the best work I've seen in a film for quite some time. Every shot in this film has been carefully thought out and work to perfection, it really shows through onto the screen. Every single element on the screen is there for a reason and there is never a moment when colours or lighting don't fit the location or the specific part of the story and character. It can go from vibrant background and colours of the city and houses to the rough and gritty desert of the book, it deserves award nominations.Next the screenplay which once again Tom Ford excels at, this film has three stories in one but you never get mixed up in any of them. This story is different, new, intriguing, edge of the seat and a mix of emotions. All these play of one another perfectly in the film and makes it a fascinating watch through the run time. Another new idea, for me anyway, that this story and screenplay convey are questions for the audience but no answers for them. Examples like was the ex-husband real, Was the story she was reading actually reality. This film defiantly makes you think which is so refreshing to see at the cinema rather than the film give you all the answers along the way.....Girl on the train...cough. As well as all the others I've mentioned this screenplay encompasses a range of different genres and pulls it of brilliantly. Whether it be romance, drama, thriller, mystery or action this film gives each of these aspects the correct amount of time and makes the film ever changing. The ending to this indelible screenplay and story is fantastic as well, reminds me of the first time I saw Inception. However I feel that this film brings up more questions, the fact that we will never know if would have turned up to met her and the end. Again brings up the question of whether he was fantasy and the story in the book was reality. Through his directing and the screenplay Tom Ford has shown the way to others how an truly extraordinary experience can take place on the big screen through a thought out film. Other film makers should strive to reach this level and in some ways this film is embarrassing for other directors to watch because this is Tom Ford's SECOND film. Some directors in the their whole career as a film maker will never reach this level which is a real eye opener. I firmly believe that this film has made a bridge for the audience between ordinary films and more independent,creative and different films from directors such as Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick. Now onto the cast and the performance of this film, amazing. Everyone Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are all fantastic in this film. The audience can have an emotional interaction with all of them, from Amy Adams character and feeling sympathy towards because of her personal life and her cheating husband. Jake Gyllenhaal's character's, yes both of them, you feel devastated for Tony and loss that he has had and what he has had to go through. But again the story brings up more questions than answers, Why didn't he fight back? Did he mean to kill himself? Also Edward as well, he was trying to do the right thing but was seen as weak but was he actually real or a fantasy of Susan's? Michael Shannon knocked it out of the park with his dark twisted portrayal of a cop coming towards the end of his career. Suffering from cancer but wanting to hold so he can finish his last case and bring the criminals to justice. The final performance was Aaron Taylor-Johnson was excellent and playing real nasty piece of work. However at the same time was funny at times, disturbing, horrible and a liar. All these qualities to the character really made you want him come to justice and for Jake Gyllenhaal""s character to get closure for horrid crime that was committed. Finally this film has truly blown me away, I came out of the theatre genuinely speechless a film has never got to me in that way. From all the accepts of this film I have spoken about this film is a true marvel and will no doubt in my mind go down as a cult classic in years to come. This is 100% worth your time and money because other people making it put there time, money and care into it. My vocabulary doesn't have enough words in it to describe this film, but this is why we all love film and strive to be a film maker or storyteller. I've given this film a 10 or 100%, this film is genuinely groundbreaking, one of the best films I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!",Nocturnal Animals
174,Ziya90,"I don't want to read that book, I want to watch the couple and see how does the things get to this point?",1,7 January 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a distant and pointless effort. There is nothing to thrill you or make you think. The first layer is somehow cold. It doesn't grab your attention. The audience cannot have a connection with the characters and the atmosphere and the second layer is pointless, because the book which is also the name of the film is revived on screen, but since it is fiction within fiction, you don't care about the characters and the events happen to them. The first layer tries to be a criticism of society or upper class, but it fails too short. It just throws us just a bunch of glimpses and there is nothing dark, sexy or smart in this tale! I wanted the movie to dig down expectations, roles and dynamics in human relationships and a criticism of modern society, but the film doesn't prefer to deal with these themes generally. In fact, I'd expected a movie like ""Sleeping with Enemy"", ""Mortal Thoughts"" or ""Diabolique"", but this movie is just an insult to the viewer, because instead of the promises of the plot, we rather watch a crime thriller in a modern Western atmosphere! That story is gripping, little suspenseful and intense thanks to the cinematography, a great Michael Shannon and an amazing Aaron Taylor-Johnson as his best acting yet. However, the movie tries to be nightmarish, but it falls too short. I love all type of Western movies and neo-noir type of films, but this was supposed to be a dark ""relationship"" movie with cynicism, so if you expect a dark relationship movie or a bitter revenge movie, you will be seriously disappointed. I like Amy Adams, but since she is in almost every movie, I have no more attraction or excitement for this beautiful lady. Jake Gylenhaal gave one of the greatest male performances of all time in ""Nightcrawler"", but he is not that great or unforgettable in this movie. Honestly, Mr. Shannon steals the whole show and he was my favorite character in this movie though! A few flashbacks, a boring opening sequence and an abrupt ending turn this movie into a big missed opportunity. Especially, after seeing that ending, I asked to myself, ""so what?"" I think that this movie deserves a shocking ending or at least an unforgettable one, but it just doesn't deliver its message. However, the movie has a hilarious opening credits which is maybe the only thing that has a meaning! I didn't buy all those metaphors between the two parallel stories in the movie.

177,hrkepler,Melodrama with Little Lynchian Coating,7,8 June 2018,"Sleek, stylish, well acted. 'Nocturnal Animals' is fashion designer turned director Tom Ford's (with whom I wasn't familiar before) second movie. Visually beautiful to look at it, but it's actually more shallow than it looks at first glance - but that doesn't mean it's bad film. The structure of the film and how these stories are connected gives little to think over after the film is finished. Melodrama, mixed with tragic and violent revenge tale with little lynchian vibe. I love how Tom Ford used two different time lines and a (parallel) fantasy universe to tell one story. Interesting angle is that we actually don't meet one of the main characters - we see him only through other character's perspective. Acting works were mainly fantastic starting from to leads Amy Adams (she deserves another Oscar nomination for her performance), Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.Ambitious and ambiguous 'Nocturnal Animals' offers wonderful visual storytelling with great performances and many ways to analyze the film. Not a masterpiece, but worth to watch.",Nocturnal Animals
178,tigerfish50,A Creature with Two Tales,7,18 December 2016,"'Nocturnal Animals' has two strands to its narrative arc. In the first, a wealthy art dealer called Susan (Amy Adams) envisions the end of her marriage when she realizes her absent spouse is having an affair. Distressed by this discovery, disillusioned by her profession, and isolated in her modernist mansion, she starts reading the manuscript of a novel which she'd recently received from a previous husband, Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal), whom she'd coldly betrayed and rejected when he'd failed as an author.The film's second strand follows the harrowing events depicted in this novel, where a man, his wife and teenage daughter are car-jacked by a trio of thugs during a nocturnal road trip through the remote West Texas desert. Initially the two narratives have little in common, but connecting points soon begin to appear - and this convergence is emphasized by the casting of Gyllenhaal and Adams-lookalike Isla Fisher as the terrorized couple. The novel's fictional events take over the film as Susan immerses herself in the nightmarish desert fable, becoming increasingly impressed by its intensity, and disturbed that its violence is a threatening message. Eventually she contacts her former husband to arrange a meeting, and this appointment paves the way for the film's enigmatic ending. The result is sophisticated entertainment, stylishly written, directed, acted and photographed. The film has been widely construed as a revenge thriller appended to a cautionary tale about the dangers of materialism. At first viewing, despite flirting with Lynchian themes and using a similar noir sensibility, Ford's project appears to lack a strong element of mystery. Deeper reflection reveals a variety of possible interpretations.",Nocturnal Animals

182,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Absorbing, unsettling masterpiece, woven in fashion fabric",9,5 November 2016,"American fashion designer, Tom Ford directs and writes the screenplay of this very stylish thriller that's based on a novel that's about a novel, with only the original source having a different title, ""Tony and Susan"" by Austin Wright. The opening certainly sets the tone for the rest of the movie which is many things, shocking, unsettling and disturbing if not grotesque. Absorbing, beautiful and profoundly vengeful. The central characters being Amy Adams' Susan, a seemingly materialistic art gallery proprietor who receives a book proof from her ex-husband after many years of silence, Edward, an author played by Jake Gyllenhaal. It arrives at a pinnacle moment in Susan's apparent synthetic life. As if to add salt to a wound as she starts to read the harrowing story about weakness, destruction, justice and revenge. The story is visualised, with Gyllenhaal dual-playing as the novel's protagonist who seems to have an analogous connection with it's author. It's painful to watch as a nightmare of Susan's visual translation of the book is played out. Taking heavy breathers where she has time to digest and reflect on her own reality, often dipping into the past for background and reason, slowly coming to terms and her position in life.These two stories co-exist and align themselves superbly sharing hints and subliminal images. It's unpredictable with much guess-work and becomes a total inconclusive mind-melt that leaves so much to ponder and discuss. Incredible performances, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon who offer equally powerful performances with a shocking cast of supports and cameos. Michael Sheen, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Laura Linney, Jena Malone and an unrecognisable Andrea Riseborough. Kick-Ass Aaron Taylor-Johnson is brilliant, unnerving and unsavoury as the story's main antagonist. The score by Abel Korzeniowski is good and very fitting for the suspense and mood of the film. Soft pianos and gentle hums to ascending key-bashing and strings help convey the cold and dark world created by both director and writer. Tom Ford's creative talents are certainly showcased here, forming a perfect amalgamation of art and story together with brilliant set pieces, costumes and even purposefully place masterpieces. I could be wrong but I'm positive I spied a Jeff Koons sculpture poolside. He truly shows the fabric of film with metallic and then coarse materials. Powerful and intense. A masterpiece.

185,rutzelb,Watchable,5,20 March 2017,"The first 20 or so minutes are tough to watch. Why? Let's start with the opening credits, which also show obese women naked, full frontal and writhing to God knows what. Then we see other naked obese women on white platforms and we see art patrons milling around. We get it. It's an art gallery show. Later we see road rage when one car bumps the other car off the road. Arguments and shoving abound and women are taken hostage. Why continue with this? Very unnerving. However, I did as this had to straighten out..hopefully. And it did, kinda.Why indeed. The second part above is from a novel Susan (Amy Adams) receives from her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). As she reads, we see the book hero Tony Hastings (also Jake Gyllenhaal) take his family on a vacation by car and three tough looking men drive him off the road and his wife and daughter are taken. These scenes are truly uncomfortable. There were 2-stories in here. Seeing Susan reading and looking back over her life doesn't count for too much as there is nothing there except she has regrets. The real story has Edward taking revenge on his ex-wife, who also aborted their baby, and she had constantly criticized his writing ability and eventually she gets it as she understands she is the wife in the novel and is killed along with her daughter. The main thrust we see is Tony getting help from Deputy Sheriff Bobby (Michael Shannon) by tracking down the 3-tough looking men and this takes up most of the movie as Susan reads the novel. Was this Edward's way of letting Susan know he would have done anything for her if given the chance? HmmmmmNotables; Andrea Riseborough as Alessia a woman Susan meets in a hotel lobby; Michael Sheen as Carlos, Alessia's gay husband; Laura Linney as Anne Sutton, Susan's mother; and Armie Hammer as Hutton Morrow, Susan's current and cheating husband. The acting is good all around, but, what was the point of all this? It was a long way to go to show simple Revenge. Susan finally realizes she has made many mistakes as she sits and waits for Edward, who wanted to meet again. She is still waiting. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

186,deastman_uk,Fool on the hill,7,18 November 2016,"This is a great looking film, that has perhaps diluted itself by trying to tell two stories at once.The bland and cold LA lifestyle intercepted by unreality in a very Lynch type of way is finely done, but is inferior to the visceral story within a story that gives the film its nerve. The vista view from the Hollywood hill is always good cinema - even though we know that we are being fed a stereotype.For this reason the ending, which is - one supposes - the connection between these two ideals falls ever so slightly flat. There are times where we are spoon fed unnecessarily, and times when detail is strangely lacking. The different styles of film communicate in different ways.It is nice to see a real adult film in the independent American cinema tradition, and repeat viewing would likely even out some of the crinkles.

187,Moviegoer19,Gap Between Novel and Film?,6,26 February 2017,"I haven't even read ""Tony and Susan,"" the novel upon which Nocturnal Animals is based, but I suspect if I had I'd be saying the novel is much better. This is due to the disjointed feeling this film had, and not only because there were two parallel stories being told, but because it felt as if stuff was left out. Maybe because the ending was so ambiguous? I was left feeling especially confused after Tony/Edward killed the man who had killed and raped his wife and daughter, and he lay outside in the desert, bloody and blinded. It looked to me as if he were dead at that point. Yet then there was that email and that he was supposedly going to meet Susan for dinner, though, of course didn't show up.As another review said, the film seemed like it was intended to say something deep or profound but, ultimately, didn't really say anything. I agree with this, although one ""message"" that did come across was if you are a writer and your material is based on your life's experiences, then even if you have horrific things happen to you, this is a good thing as it helps you to produce fascinating stories. I had that experience while watching, i.e., the most engrossing part of the film was when Tony/Edward was going through his ordeal, yet horrible things happened that one wouldn't wish on anyone.

188,perica-43151,Nice artsy movie about actions having consequences,10,13 October 2019,"This movie is a vast improvement on the book it was based on, it is much more piercing, intelligent and distilled with some brilliant additions. Cinematography is outstanding, movie is atmospheric and highly stylized, reminiscent of the best works of Hitchcock and Kubrick, with great attention to minute details - deliberate style that comes across as natural, but only on second examination is revealed as extremely deep and thoughtful.The movie is concerned with Susan, an upper class woman married into wealth, that has since begun to crumble, who leads an empty life, that is falling apart, as she is unloved and deeply unhappy. She receives a novel, written by her ex-husband, who she cruelly abandoned as he was not able to provide the luxury she now lives in, being a ""weakling"" as a young aspiring writer, in estimation of her overbearing mother. The novel is about some scary rednecks destroying a man's family, after pushing their car off road. It turns out there are clear parallels between the redneck monsters in the story within a story and her actions, driven by her inner selfish monstrosity and cynical and rich mother but with the exact sophistication of an average redneck psychopath. Shattered to the core, after reading the book, she invites her ex to a dinner but is left waiting, and realizes sadly that she is never going to be forgiven, that hell is eternal and that her empty existence now is a karmic payback that she very well deserved for her past shallow choices and selfish crimes.The movie portrays some of the issues that are in fact pretty common, and the movie is partly underappreciated due to not fitting in the woke-hysteria that was just starting to boil at the time of movie release. But objectively, it is one hell of a masterpiece of sophisticated storytelling, that also carries a message about consequences of the wrong choices people make in life.",Nocturnal Animals
189,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,5,16 November 2016,"Before we write this review just be warned that this review will contain major spoilers so if you don't wish to know spoilers please scroll down to another review.First off this film was advertised everywhere. All our friends were saying how great it looked, and to be honest we thought it did too. So we watched it with an open mind and that this film will be one of the best films of 2016...sadly it wasn't.The moment the film starts we are thrown into an intro of dancing, naked fat ladies (sometimes in slow motion), which was quite a weird way to start a movie. We then find out it's a form of art by Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). That was just a stupid way of starting a movie, by the way. Then we have Susan's ex husband send her a script called ""Nocturnal Animals."" Mind you, she tells her actual husband this and his reaction is just ""Okay cool."" Still weird. Susan then decides to read the script. Things then start to get interesting as the script is quite thrilling, dark and cruel to say the least.The story of ""Nocturnal Animals"" itself is quite interesting. The story of a man's daughter and wife who gets swept off the road by a pair of nasty criminals lead by Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor Johnson). They then get kidnapped and the husband escapes and goes to the local Law Officer by the name of Bobby Endes (Michael Shannon). They then find out that the wife and kid are dead. Now it's revenge time to hunt down Ray Marcus and his criminal friends! The acting was top notch, let us be clear on that. Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson were the best parts of the film. We believe it is their best acting role yet. However, the switching back and fourth between the script and Susan was quite annoying and downright irritating. Just when the actual script gets interesting and when it lures you in it switches back to Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) who we just don't give a damn about. Tom Ford's directing didn't really work for us and it didn't add anything new. I'm sure this film will be an Oscar Contender. This and ""No Country For Old Men"" are literally the only two films we disagree on on getting so much hype. See it for the acting, and not for the low budget, horrible, fake scenery and weird plot. 2/5 stars. 5/10.",Nocturnal Animals
190,danielharden,From Suits to Cinema,8,16 June 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a film by Ford, Tom Ford. The fashion designer turned writer/director brings us, in his second feature film, the story of Susan, an art gallery owner who receives a draft of her ex husband, Edward's, new novel. As she reads, she becomes more and more absorbed in protagonist, Tony's, ordeal, relating and feeling for him as well as, reflecting upon her own life. Tom Ford proves himself to be a man of many talents, crafting a story that is seamlessly interwoven and complex, and is also guaranteed to generate discussion. This was a major Oscar snub at the 2017 academy awards.Ford's efforts are not only good in their own right, but in the fact that they marry so well into each other. Ford is able to write a fantastic script and then elevate that with his stunning direction. The two work seamlessly together. Just one way in which Ford displays a sophisticated interworking of script and direction, comes in the presentation of the three different time lines. Ford's script is multi layered and features three different time lines; Susan's past, Susan's present and the fictional world of the Nocturnal Animal's book. The script jumps from each timeline with purpose and Ford's visual presence defines each timeline; Susan's present being very desaturated and dull looking, Susan's past being soft lit and somewhat warmer and nicer, and the book being very saturated with the beige and orange a Texan desert would entail. The audience is always aware of what timeline they are in with Ford's highly sophisticated narrative structure as well as the visual distinction he makes between each timeline.Personally the greatest aspect of Ford's masterpiece is his use of symbolism. Whether it is the red couch or literally every character in the book, Ford embeds meaning that film critics and scholars could write papers on and endlessly discuss. It is obvious that Tony Hastings is a reflection of Edward Sheffield, but to what extent is Tony a reflection of Susan? And although Ford has stated what Ray and Bobby represent, could we go deeper, exploring what they represent to Edward and Susan as well? Could we narrow down their purpose in the story or are they simply personifications of the good and the bad? The film is open to discussion and thus I believe this gives it a long shelf life.Ford is also very good when handling his themes. Nocturnal Animals is a revenge story, hell it literally spells out the word 'Revenge' in an art piece mid film, but the film is also a cautionary tale to successful people, and frankly anyone, about how they shouldn't throw people away for money, or fame, or any other kind of acclaim or success. Considering Ford being a part of both the fashion and film industry, to very brutal industries, you can tell that he has struggled with this. This message thus feel like a personal belief of Ford's and this is felt in his film, thus adding an auteur touch to his work. Going back to the theme of revenge again, the ending is the crescendo to what is Ford's symphony. The entire film has built to this moment and the ultimate revenge is claimed by Edward and it is simply magnificent, the bitter sweet cherry on top if you will.As well as Ford, the film boasts an extremely talented cast; Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Michael Shannon, Michael Sheen, Isla Fisher etc. The ensemble cast pretty much guarantees good acting and they do not disappoint, in fact it even surprised me in a good way. The stand out performance is what surprised me, and that came from none other than Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The actor completely subverts any expectations of him in a truly gritty and evil performance as the films antagonist, Ray Marcus. Far removed from Kick Ass and the dull protagonist he played in Godzilla, Taylor-Johnson earned his Golden Globe for this film and definitely deserved an Oscar nomination. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon also shine in this film, especially when they share scenes together. Shannon's American hero sheriff character, Bobby Andes, is extremely likable and the chemistry he has with Jake Gyllenhaal's extremely emotional, Tony Hastings, is subtly displayed yet in a rather engrossing way. The diner scene is one of the best in the film and presents their mutual respect and care for one another perfectly.Nocturnal Animal's is a triumph. Ford successfully both writes and directs a multi layered story with exquisite symbolism and powerful messages and themes. An all round outstanding production that has been majorly overlooked at the Oscars.... The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams, that in itself is a formula for a great movie that will be overlooked at the Oscars, but hopefully one day they will all get their day in the sun.",Nocturnal Animals
191,Hussain-AL-Naseer,Nocturnal Animals,7,3 July 2020,"The film has 3 segments all revolving around Susan Morrow played by Amy Adams i.e. present time when she's married second time yet alone , The past when she met her first husband who was writer and she married him against all the odds and yet left him for the same reasons and the Novel part which is dedicated to her in the present time by her Ex-Husband which she's reading and connecting it with her past failed relationship, now I know its little complex when you're reading but when you'll see the movie you'll not find it confusing which is because of the fine visual and narrative skill of the director Tom Ford. Apart form good Narrative & Visual the film is also watch worthy for the performances by Amy Adams, Gyllenhall & Michael Shannon.

Should I watch this? Will this be anything to grasp? If you like movies that is far off the ordinary, watch ""Nocturnal animals"". Otherwise; look at something else.A story of a woman being mean and off to her ex partner 20 years in the past, just to be reminded through a script sent to her written by the same partner. A day to day life of the successful art gallery owner Susan Morrow blends with the gritty and hard script sent to her, displayed as a hard boiled drama thriller. Together with the manuscript the production team brings a real hard atmosphere to the audience. The tension that is created with delicacy is amazing; an on edge experience! Tom Ford has done a tremendous job in pushing the actors to create that special moment and tension even more.This movie is like the film ""Neon Demon"", speaking of the visual excellence coming into place in the world of (Amy Adams). The difference is that ""Nocturnal Animals"" has a driven and rough story that both polish the raw side of the fiction and at the same time shows the art of complexity.The writers have had some clear breakthrough speaking of the creativity within the story. To create a fasade of excellence and state of the art film noir to show a successful woman's life in art, and letting a script show off the thriller side of the movie is genius... pure genius.Nominated for three Golden Globes, and I have to say that is fair. Remember; revenge is best served ice cold on the rocks... empty left in a restaurant.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : The soundtrack lifts this really high up there. Especially in Susan Morrows life; some both awkward and boring situations tweaked maximum with ""dangerous and professional"" music spoken out by an orchestra. The touch of letting new angles in the experience for the viewer being shown and come into place is thoughtful and enjoyable to watch. The visual editing is so run through with creativity and innovative thinking that it were more than inspiring to watch. - The actors : Jake Gyllenhaal nails the character of Tony Hastings. His presence and relaxed confidence shines through; many times I were left in awe. One example: look at his outburst at approximately 1 hour and 14 minutes into this one in the little cabin. Fantastic! - Entertainment : As an piece of art; strange and wonderful at the same time. - Age : 157,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",Nocturnal Animals

If there is a plot in here somewhere I really missed it. Besides the stories matched really bad and it became confusing that you started to wonder if it were flashbacks from the story or from ""actual life"".A lot of scenes dragged and scenes that could have made an impact are very numbed down and to much attention on boring art that had little to nothing to do with the movie. Dialogue felt really awkward sometimes and even messed up the characters even more because it made 'm come across like a bunch of snobs.Also the same dialogue was repetitive and some exposition was first discussed and later on almost the same thing is discussed again. The movie is not that difficult that you have to explain yourself 2 to 3 times.I mean what""s the point and why would a director treat his audience this way. I almost would think that the arrogance of this director is the reason critics rate this so highly while I view this more as form over substance thing, which is fine if your talking to an art house crowd but not for the average moviegoer.Now I watched this to the end waiting for the plot that never came and Amy Adams getting stood up in a restaurant probably also waiting for the plot that never came and that sums up to a plot less movie.There are people that like these kind of movies where style is more a factor than story if you don't mind that to much you might like this.

But by imagining these scenes as Amy Adams reading a manuscript makes the idea more ""intellectual"" or, as some critics would say, stylish, I think the film, which is often quite riveting and tense, would have been better if it had just been a straight-forward thriller, perhaps less original, but also more believable and less pretentious. Overall, not bad, but I had a disappointed feeling at the end, despite excellent performances, especially by Michael Shannon.

It tries to interweave three different story lines, into one cohesive narrative, and while it didn't quite work for me, I appreciated their attempt. Only one of the stories was truly captivating to me, and that was the one with Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon. I was on the edge of my seat with that storyline, wondering what was going to happen next. And the performances were so good in that storyline, adding to the compulsion of the narrative. However, I didn't find the other two stories nearly as fascinating. They were fine, but I was just waiting for them to end so that we could find out what happens next to Gyllenhaal. I wish all the story lines had the drive and the intensity of this one, and it's kind of a shame that they don't.

201,mbhgkmsgg,Nocturnal Animals,7,27 December 2020,"Nocturnal Animals is a stylistic thriller that tries to woo its audience with a story deeper than first meets the eye. While the styling, at times, feels a little overdone, the result is a film that, if nothing else, looks stunning. Thankfully, there is a lot to like in addition to the visuals.Now, while there is a lot to like in Nocturnal Animals, it is also filled with questionable choices. As such, it has been hard to decide how I feel about it. One of its strengths, certainly, is the way it looks. With plenty of long and meandering shots that all look great, the film manages to pull off an almost calming feel, despite its story. Indeed, a lot of the film tends to veer towards style over substance, and at times, it leads to an unfulfilling and anticlimactic feel. However, even with its flaws, the story is quite engaging. And it's not the story itself that is the problem, it's primarily the way it's told. The big thing in Nocturnal Animals, and what it does to set itself apart, is creating two separate stories that intertwine. However, while it is a great concept, the problem here is that the two stories don't really add anything to one another. They are two different tales, happening at seemingly two different times, to two different groups of people. While it is clear that each story is supposed to add weight to the other, the resulting product caused me to lose interest in both.The story, which after given some thought, is certainly deeper than first meets the eye, never quite has the impact it clearly attempts to reach. It follows Susan, an artist who is in an unhappy marriage, as she receives a book draft from an ex-husband. As she delves into the book, we get to witness the characters and story of it through what is essentially a movie in a movie. The book follows Tony, who loses his wife and daughter to an atrocious act of violence. As he goes on a quest for revenge, it becomes clearer and clearer that both stories parallel each other in more than one way. And as Susan falls in love with Edward, his ex-husband, again, he ends up getting the revenge that he was looking for after their relationship ended.
The summary I wrote, doesn't even begin to accurately portray the story, with all its subtleties, and parallelisms. While the story in the book is a fairly simple revenge thriller, and the story taking place outside the book an even simpler story of lost love, the way the combine as one in creating the overarching story that is Nocturnal Animals, is quite interesting. If you were to watch this movie without giving it your full attention, I'd guess that it would be very unimpactful. However, once you get into it, and really pay attention to everything that is happening, the subtle hints and nods from the book's story into the history between Susan and Edward, make for a surprisingly good experience.However, while the two stories create an intricate and exciting web that the viewer has to navigate through to find any depth in the film, I ended up feeling dissatisfied. I found myself constantly looking for a deeper connection between the two stories, and unfortunately, I never found it. On the surface, Nocturnal Animals feels rudimentary, and unless you are willing to spend time thinking about it, it will say that way. And unless I knew that I was going to write a review about it, I doubt that I would've spent any time thinking about what I saw. Although I have recently learned to love movies that force me to think about them to find a deeper and more meaningful message, the film has to be intriguing enough, even at its most surface level, to make me spend the time. Nocturnal Animals, unfortunately, never quite reaches the level of excitement and interest that would've made me eager to spend more time with it.All in all, though, Nocturnal Animals is an intense thriller that offers new ideas and gorgeous visuals, despite feeling overly stylized at times. I was pleasantly surprised by the chances it took, and if nothing else, this film can never be described as safe. While it doesn't quite hit the nail on the head with its execution, the final product is intriguing and exciting enough to make for a good and thought-provoking film that kept me engaged from start to finish.",Nocturnal Animals
202,annuskavdpol,Many people go through this in life,8,15 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals 2016 is a good movie. I saw it in the Odeon last night on Yates ST in Victoria City, Canada. The movie is about a lost love, someone the lead lady clearly did love a lot, but because of life circumstances she bowed down to conformity instead of following her heart and soul - or was this really the case? Amy Adams's character was probably a lot more complex then meets the eye. Even though she says she loved Jake Gyllenhaal she was not happy with him. In life, there are times when love is not enough, and this could have been one of those times. Perhaps in fairy tales, love conquers all, but in reality this is rarely the case. Nowadays, if humans are compelled to give an honest answer (which is debatable)many people will admit their marriages are not all that they set out to be. But as people get older, people compromise. True love can also be very detrimental to the heart, and this might have been the case with Amy Adams. I do not see this movie as a case of revenge by Jake Gyllenhaal onto Amy Adams - with the writing of his master novel and giving it to her before the publication. I regard the act of giving the book a gesture of reconciliation between the 2 or 3 (including the terminated baby) souls. To me, Jake Gyllenhaal's character seemed to have blamed himself for the demise of the relationship. And may be this is true. Perhaps it was the pain he suffered after the relationship ended which made him able to write a heart-felt novel - something which he probably could not do within the relationship. Many artists need to be alone in order to create. It has to do with independent space and privacy. I do not think the ending of the movie was sad, nor did Amy Adams' character feel a sense of doom around her life. Instead, I feel she became aware of her own existence, her ability to acknowledge the good art-work i.e. the written book, Nocturnal Animals, of her late husband, Jake Gyllenhaal. Art Gallery owners often have an eye of good art, that is their skill. Also being self-critical, as an Art Gallery Owner is probably a major stereotype, because on a macro-level, Art Gallery Owners are artists themselves, just collecting, buying and selling other people's artworks, but it is inside of her own art gallery where the sales are done. To me, this art of sales is a creative skill, just like the creative art is a skill.",Nocturnal Animals

Then sudden personality change and sweet, sweet revenge. Or not.Typically movie of this sort would be 5/10 and well worth the watching despite the mediocrities. Nocturnal Animals does manage to do few things in such advanced awfulness, that it becomes close to unwatchable.1) Jake Gyllenhaal's character is so boring, blatant and useless that there is no reasonable explanation to care about what happens to him or his family. I found the generic bad guys to be more relatable than this personality lacking loser of a man. And those guys didn't even have personalities either. 2) The editing. This is a story withing a story. In execution this is lot like a time skip which doesn't skip time - more familiarly knows as the Fairy Tail Trolling. It doesn't add anything to the story, but manages to annoy with its amateurish nature. +) The hype. This was supposed to be a good movie. 5/10 at least.

206,midas-jacobs,"Beautiful looking film, that makes you think about it afterwards!",10,29 January 2017,"Susan receives a manuscript, written by her ex-husband, in which he tells a violent story. She gets very involved into the story, because she sees it as a revenge tale.Tom Ford, the designer, returns to direct another film after a hiatus of seven years. Ford shows in this film that he hasn't lost his mojo. His artistic vison really helped to create very good looking and stylish shots, with a lot of use of color, which brings its own meaning to the shot. Ford used cold colors (blue, white) in the scenes with Amy Adams (Susan) and warmer colors (red, orange) in the scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal (Tony). I haven't come to realize why he chose to use different colors for the both of them, but I have a few guesses. One of them is that he decided to do this, to show the difference between what was taking place in the book and what was taking place in ""real life"". Another guess I have is that the colder colors represent the loneliness and sadness Susan is feeling. But those are just guesses. Ford didn't only use these colors to symbolize cold and warm, but also to show emotions. Red stood for love, or death. Green stood for envy. The use of color was sublime and really made you think more about the movie. The shot composition too was very good and the camera movements as well. The use of shadow was perfect. In short: this was a gorgeous looking movie. Another thing that Tom Ford did was creating a weird film. He didn't make a straightforward film, but he created a film that has you thinking about it after you've seen it. It even starts way in the beginning with the opening credits, that were kind of weird, but fantastically set up the theme for the rest of the movie. It prepares you for what's to come and immediately shows that the movie is not your average film, but something that's different than all, which I very much enjoyed. The soundtrack I found to be fitting and original. It helped a lot to set up the scene. The editing also helped with this, but also to show the similarities between the manuscript and Susan's life. This was done in a very good manner and the pacing was good too. I didn't feel that the movie was too long or too short: it was just the right length. Due to this the film also never drags, which is of course a good thing. The acting was absolutely marvelous. Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams both give excellent performances. Gyllenhaal played his character so well, that I didn't see Jake Gyllenhaal, but Tony, or at times Edward. He performed well in the emotional scenes, but he is also very good in showing the subtle character progression he goes through. Amy Adams has previously starred in this years ""Arrival"", where she plays a totally different character. It's really fascinating to see how diverse she can act, because the two characters have no correlation to each other. Like I've said: two different characters. In both cases she gave a fantastic performance, and that's why I was surprised she didn't get an Oscar nod for one of her performances. Not only Gyllenhaal and Adams gave a wonderful performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon were superb as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson was really unrecognizable. He was scary, weird and really nailed the part. Michael Shannon too was fantastic. He gave, in my opinion, the best performance of the entire film.The screenplay was also a very good adaptation. The dialogue was good, but the narrative was the thing that really spoke to me. I very much enjoyed the way how they wove together the three stories and kept it all easy to differentiate. All of the stories were very intriguing, whereby I wasn't bored a single minute. The characters were original and not clichéd. You were able to care for them and they also went through some development. I very much liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character. He played the main villain of the story, but the way they wrote him was brilliant. He was scary and intimidating, yet he wasn't really big, or built in a strong manner. It all came from his character. Amy Adams character was also multi-layered. At first she just seems like any other wealthy person, but as the movie progresses, you get to know her more, mostly because of the flashback scenes. The ending was also very good. It doesn't explain itself, which I like very much. This ensures that there are multiple explanations for it. ""Nocturnal Animals"" has quickly grown to be one of the best movies of 2016, in my opinion at least. The film challenges you to think about it, not only during the film, but also after the credits have stopped rolling. Tom Ford created a visually stunning film, with some weird scene, but those all have an underlying meaning to them. Because of those reasons summed up just now, I'm giving ""Nocturnal Animals"" a 9.5/10.",Nocturnal Animals
207,JeanMoniette,"Could have been a classic, but failed in two main ways (no spoiler)",8,19 May 2020,"Spoiler free as usual:
This is an incredibly slick movie which manages to ooze intimidation and fear in all the right places. It grabs you in the first 30 minutes and never lets you go.Sadly, it's not perfect, in fact the movie suffers from two main flaws:Firstly, the lead is miscast. At no point did i feel that Jake Gyllenhaal, action hero extraordinaire, was 'helpless' - when they could have easily cast another actor for that aspect of the role (lack of) physicality. In fact there are several shots were Jake is naked and looking like an Adonis demi-god, which severely detracts from the experience and the plot.Second, the movie is almost too slick for its own good. There's a 'detachment' that's felt from the saturated colors, the deep blacks and the cellulose feel of the flick. That's accentuated by how raw the film feels otherwise, down to the amazing, courageous ending by the director. What a shame - a movie never needed a 4k upconvert and remaster that badly.All and all, this is the movie that i'd have given a 10 to if they had gone all the way and ditched the hollywood glitz, but sadly with Clooney as exec that was never to be. Huge shame. 8/10 nonetheless because the screenplay and script carries it, alongside an enormous performance by Michael Shannon in the role of his career so far.",Nocturnal Animals

211,texshelters,This dark drama is worth seeing for Gyllenhaal and Shannon's performances.,6,15 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals: A movie to love and to hateIf I were to rate the first fifteen minutes of Nocturnal Animals, I would give it an F-. The rest of the film gets a solid B. The opening credits consist of footage of naked and incredibly obese women. What point was being made? That we objectify people? Well the rest of the film doesn't bare out this message. That life is grotesque? Again, the footage doesn't have much to do with the message of the film. If the footage was used to show how grotesque the main character is, well, that doesn't play out either. It's a terrible choice; I can't justify it within the film. Let's say that it was to point out the grotesque nature of Susan Marrow, the ex-wife of Edward in the film. However, the character isn't written as grotesque, and even if she was written that way, Amy Adams couldn't pull off that complexity. If there was a point to the outrageous exhibition at the beginning, then put it in the film. But there wasn't. It was a poor choice, even it was in the book. And after the visual assault of the credits, we see an inane discussion about life in L.A. between the trite victims of this abomination Susan calls art. Watching this, I yearned for early Woody Allen scenes that mocked modern art in the finest New York galleries. That said, once Susan receives an advanced copy of her ex-husband Edward's book, 'Nocturnal Animals', and starts reading it, the movie transforms itself from a trite, simpering take on bad art to a dark treatise on life and the consequences of our actions. As Susan reads, the book plays itself out visually in her mind and on screen. It's bleaker than anything Susan would dare put up in her little trendy atrocity gallery. The movie adeptly intermixes action from the book and the present day time line. Edward really has found his muse, and thus he wrote the book. However, the books parts of the movie are better than the regular film. Here's why: Amy Adams versus Michael Shannon and trite whining compared to intense human drama. Amy Adams just isn't up to the complexity this role calls for. The role of Susan is undercast. Jennifer Lawrence or Felicity Jones almost certainly would have been better. Jones isn't doing anything lately, is she?On the other hand, Michael Shannon delivers the role of Lieutenant Bobby Andes with every fiber of his being. He is believable, ultra real. Shannon doesn't make one false move, even out-acting the talented and adept Gyllenhaal in their scenes together. While we are on the acting, I want to know where the casting director picked up the three dirtbags, and they are indeed dirtbags, for this film. They ooze terror out of the greasy pours, able to exude horror while playing friendly. Well done union of felonious actors! Gyllenhaal shows his range and accuracy in both the flashbacks of Edward's marriage to Susan and as the family man from the book, Tony Hastings. Isla Fisher as Tony's wife is okay, not terrible, but not asked to do much. The same is true for the actress playing their daughter India, Ellie Bamber. Armie Hammer is perfectly wooden in his role as Susan's handsome new husband. The role was written for him. One surprise highlight: Laura Linney is excellent as Susan's mother. The screenwriter, Tony Ford, wrote an great scene for her and her daughter Susan. The plot alternates between interesting and tedious as it goes from book to current day. The cinematography is also more interesting during the filmed book parts and tedious during the filming of the life of Susan. Susan couldn't be more of a dullard compared to Edward's clearly interesting character. Who else could have written the madness in the book? That brings me to the endings: the ending of the book within the film and the film itself. At first I thought the ending of the book in the movie was too coincidental, too pat, too simplistic. However I reconsidered once I realized that within the context of the wider film, the way the book ended made sense. It matched the theme of the film perfectly. The ending of the film made sense within the context of the characters and relationships in the film. Writer and director Ford made the most of the dramatic situation and unlike the beginning of the film, the story all came to a logical conclusion. Rating: Matinée. I struggled with this one. If you do pay full price, skip the first five to fifteen minutes. The film after that is quite good. Unfortunately, the scenes with Susan and her art crowd drag the film down. See it for the performances of Gyllenhaal, Shannon and Linney and the dramatic take on life's choices. Peace, Tex Shelters",Nocturnal Animals
212,airsnob,What?,6,12 September 2017,"So many times in film, they set out to make a painting. They seem to forget though, that it is a film, not a canvas they are creating. Such is the main problem with this film, or clunker. It is artsy garbage. From the first credits to the last scene. None of it with any power or depth. Just surface and vapid all the way through. The performances were ; Our lead actress didn't penetrate ... you can tell all to easily she is way outside her scope. I could feel her trying so hard and just not able to relate to this character at all. She was acting. Not telling a truth. Jake G was great, his performances are really outstanding lately. This film is no different. Mike what's his name as the gay friend ( or brother) was great. He is such a great character actor... I don't know why we don't see him in more. But overall this film fell so flat. Even the story in the book was outrageous and contrived .. this film is A by-polar mess. With no real message other than the one you heard in the first couple of scenes ... there is no mystery here, no feelings, no point or catharsis. It is just a day out of a horrible woman's life. One line stood out to me more than all the others. At the dinner table the gay friend looks at our viper and tells her , ""Our lives are so much better than everyone's else's."" I think that was meant as an oxymoron , but essentially he is absolutely correct. I don't think there is anything interesting about spoiled brats considering their spoiled-ness, do you? Being filthy rich is better than being poor. Period. Anything past that needs to be proved, and this movie didn't prove anything. Other than that statement in the end. This film is a terrible story, with awful characters and no feelings attached. Much like the cast of characters .. just empty. Anyone who sees anything else in this is probably lying. Seriously. Just thinking they should like it because it looks cool on the outside. Honestly I fast forwarded through most of it. The retelling of the book scenes - none of them worth the watch. They were so unrealistic that it was dumb. I guess the message of the film was that cold , driven and ambitious women are equal to murderous psychopathic rapists.

214,Manal1987,Metafiction and Flamboyance in Nocturnal Animals (2016),8,6 June 2017,"Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals (2016) opens with a sequence that has been attacked for being disgusting, demeaning, misogynist and irrelevant. The sequence features a number of obese women provocatively dancing nude, which turns out to be part of an exhibition put on in an art gallery owned by Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). I just can't help but wonder whether viewers would have had the same reaction if the dancing models were slim SuperBarbies or six-packed young men. Just wondering.The sequence is shocking, and it sets the entire tone of the film because it unveils the stark discrepancy between reality and our individual perception of what reality is – a kernel component of the story.We then follow the extremely classy Susan to the coldness of her prodigal house and get to know her dashingly handsome, and equally distant, husband Hutton (conveniently played by Armie Hammer). Susan receives the manuscript of a new novel written by her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) whom she hasn't seen in years. She decides to occupy her sleepless nights reading the book which, according to Edward's note, is inspired by and dedicated to her. Here, the diegetic narrative unfolds into other two story lines treading two different paths: fictional and chronological. As Susan reads the emotionally devastating story about Tony Hastings (also played by Gyllenhaal) who takes his family on a trip that ends tragically with the rape and murder of his wife and daughter, she helplessly reminisces about her self-sabotaged relationship with Edward.It's a no-brainer figuring out that Edward's novel is an allegory of the emotional turmoil caused by Susan who had aborted his child and run off with a wealthier and worldlier man. In the end, Tony takes revenge on the men who killed his family, and Edward well, he doesn't exactly kill Susan, but he does something similar: He stands her up at a restaurant. Yes. That's it. I know how absurd the comparison may sound but please bear with me.Edward is a writer. He is wired to creatively put himself and his emotions on the line and transform his reality into art. Susan, on the other hand, who married Edward solely to rebel against her parents' selective lifestyle, willingly traps herself and limits her emotions to the reality of a rigid, materialistic world. It is hard to miss how the blue and white colors dominate the scenes in which Susan is on screen, whereas red and green are the main colors in Edward's story. They both stand in contrast to each other, yet visually negotiate the relation between reality and fiction.. what it is and what it feels like.Edward's payback is epic by all means; just as Susan had pumped reality into his art by providing him with the painful experience and memories, he has contaminated her fragile, dry reality with his emotionally powerful art. By making Susan read his novel, allowing her the pleasure to suffer and catharize her sense of guilt, offering her a glimpse of sentimental freedom, and getting her hopes up about loving and being loved only to crush them down is just as harsh as a bullet to the brain.Tony had a gun. Edward had a story.Tony, Edward's metafictional persona, is blinded after shooting the deranged murderer Ray (a wickedly excellent performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and accidentally – or not! – kills himself. The scene is ostentatiously grotesque if we think about it in realistic/Susan's terms. However, it perfectly resonates with Edward's pain and his creative attempts to emotionally strip in front of everyone – an act virtually similar to suicide.And if you think that the novel is an exaggerated expression of a relatively less painful hardship, add the film itself as another non-diegetic layer of artistic exaggeration of a seemingly humdrum experience. Ford brilliantly embraces and manifests art as a lavish exaggeration of the mundane; this is not only evident in the story but in his picturesque style and rakish colors and frames as well. Nocturnal Animals is a Charlie Kaufman-esque film with the flamboyant sensitivity of Tom Ford.The film features an outstanding cast who don't shy away from flaunting their admirable talents around. And still, the effortless greatness of Michael Shannon who plays Bobby Andes, the hard-boiled detective who helps Tony find the murderers, has left me in awe.Here comes another film from screenwriter and director Tom Ford, and along comes another sea-parting controversy over his competence as a filmmaker. À la the hassle that followed A Single Man (2009), critics and viewers alike are quite unsure what to make of Mr. Ford's work: Should he be banished back to the flamboyant world of fashion design? Should he be hailed as a stylishly exuberant auteur? Whichever stance people take, the only thing that annoys me is the insistence on using Ford's renowned career in fashion against him. The sensibilities employed to create fashion and visual art in general are extravagant, but isn't cinema all about the extravagant symbolism of the image?",Nocturnal Animals

I found Susan's struggle much more interesting and intriguing than the story told in Edwards book. I feel like this film would have benefited better being a relationship drama about the rise and fall of Edward and Susan's relationship, but to add what happens in his book takes you out of it, because it makes him look like a really bad guy. Susan did some crappy things, but if his book is a metaphor for what she did to him, he's totally over dramatic. His actions in the film are just plain petty, especially at the end, and especially given how much time has passed. One could argue that Susan's current empty life is karma, but I definitely felt for her more than him.",Nocturnal Animals
216,robertmaybeth,An understated and subtle masterpiece of dramatic storytelling.,8,16 June 2020,"This emotionally-charged film is novel and original, and will make you question everything about the world it shows the audience. I'm really not doing it justice when I say ""Animals"" takes you on the proverbial roller coaster; although that saying is trite, it's the quickest way to describe the feelings and emotions this film will inevitably calls up in the viewer. And what this movie will make you feel is damn near everything.The ""film within a film"" style done here is an integral part of the film and has never been done better - I'd describe the style (and only the style) as ""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Total Recall"". But the knowledge we're watching a novel unfold for much of the story, does nothing to detract from the in-your-face power of the often harrowing events. The often dark and painful things the characters endure, often seem to compel the viewer to confront almost every emotion in existence, and I got the distinct feeling that this movie was trying to do exactly that: Disgust, sadness, empathy, revenge, rage, this film somehow touches them all.Despite the gritty subject matter, I enjoyed this film very much - it grabbed me right away and kept me absorbed right up to the ending (which I felt was unsatisfying at first, but I got over it - thanks to IMDB).",Nocturnal Animals
217,Ben-Hibburd,Nocturnal Animals Review.,9,1 August 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a stylish thriller written and directed by Tom Ford. In only his second outing as writer/director Ford shows a incredible level of maturity and ease behind the camera. This is exemplified as the film interweaves three stories at once. The film follows Susan Morrow(Amy Adams) as she receives an advanced copy of a revenge thriller novel from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield(Jake Gyllenhaal). Who during the course of film is shown through flashbacks to have been badly hurt by Susan in the films second narrative.As Susan begins to read the novel dedicated to her entitled Nocturnal Animals, the film splits into its third story. It sees Gyllenhaal play the fictional book character called Tony Hastings. As she becomes more and more engrossed in the brutal story, she begins to reflect back on key events that have effected her life and lead to her creative and emotional un-fulfilment.The third storyline, which is the fictional novel unfolding on the screen, is the best part of the film. This story in a story focuses on Tony and his family who are going on a vacation, that is until things turn fatally violent on a lone desert road. They are attacked and ridden off the road at the malice of a crazed lunatic Ray Marcus sadistically played by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, and his two buddies. This part of the story is Immediately the most engaging aspect of the film, and remains so until all three stories converge in the final ten minutes of the film.Nocturnal Animals is beautifully shot by Ford and his cinematographer Seamus McGorvey. It's impeccably crafted using stunning visual imagery. Although it's filled at times with fairly blatant and over the top symbolism and allegories. Whilst it can be distracting in a couple of scenes, the symbolism is well thought out for the most part. Nocturnal Animals is a well written film that pulls no punches, whilst it might not be as brutally visceral as some films in its genre, it's raw Intensity keeps the viewer on edge for the majority of the film. It's a fantastically crafted revenge thriller that works on multiple levels.",Nocturnal Animals

219,Oberrated,Thought-provoking and flawlessly done,8,11 December 2016,"'Nocturnal Animals' was enthralling to say the least. Curiosity took over me from the very get go of this film and truly has not ended even as I sit and type this review up. And if you have not gathered this conclusion yourself, this is a very good thing from my point of view. I love films that can keep a viewer guessing and curious throughout its duration and especially love when it continues to keep you thinking long after one has left their auditorium. Tom Ford and company has done a phenomenal job with this piece and I am applauding at what this film has turned out to be. The execution of three different story lines was done flawlessly. Once I was immersed in what was happening in one story, I was plucked into another one, leaving myself confused then immediately invested in what was newly occurring on screen. This may leave some permanently confused or some may dislike this style but regardless, when it is boiled down, this film does it in perfect fashion... The debate may go on forever on what actor or actress was better in this film but everyone was truly top-notch. I personally was impressed with Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Jake Gyllenhaal. Aaron-Taylor Johnson plays Ray Marcus, an unpredictable and terrifying character. His performance without spoilers is simply just remarkable. Jake Gyllenhaal has a knack for performing excellently with characters placed in a dark and scary place. His character of Edward/Tony is full of emotion and I personally felt the despair he portrayed his character having. Overall, just a fantastic performance by these two as well as the entire cast.To this point, I am still researching this movie. Gathering my own opinions and conclusions. Trying to understand the motives of characters and figuring out the symbolism behind many different occurrences within it. 'Nocturnal Animals' is a fantastic piece of film. A film that can keep an audience curious and wanting more or maybe leaving some members of said audience angry and upset with what they have watched. Regardless of where you may fall, this film can be difficult, it could be confusing, but at the end of they day it is brilliantly done in any way you can think.",Nocturnal Animals

The setting of Los Angeles and the fashion world gives it a slightly otherworldly feel and adds to the atmosphere, like neon demon. The scene on the highway with the cars is one of the most tense scenes I've seen in recent in memory. It is also effective at portraying the frustration of seeing Tony fail to act strongly in his role. As well, it wasn't until I saw the credits that I realized that Johnson was the main antagonist.

222,AlbertCinefilu,"Dark, disturbing and powerful",9,2 March 2021,"''May you never feel such despair or guilt'' is what I wish you after having watched the movie. Especially the part with the guilt.''Nocturnal Animals'' is both a wreakful, vindictive fantasy, a requiem for those who were wronged and a wake-up call for the wrongdoers who have never grasped the consequences of their deeds. The film possesses a dark, depressing, gripping beauty in its imagery. Hues of red, a melancholic blue, the blackness of darkness and a blinding light dominate the mournful dessert and the exuberant, yet cold and lonely house of the protagonist. It is an excellently well-crafted atmosphere of remorse.I haven't read Austin Wright's novel, unhappily, but the movie surprised me. I didn't know where everything was going to go in the beginning, later on some threads seemed a bit too entangled and perhaps some of the dialogue could have been bettered BUT... what was good, was good. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was priceless, it should be taken as an example for one of the greatest displays of rage and wrath seen in the cinema of the 21st century (along with his mirror scene in ''Nightcrawler''). Amy Adams also felt the right choice, I saw her in The Master and Arrival and she has one of those unique ''sad eyes'' that I held in high regard. The soundtrack is a treasure, thanks Abel Korzeniowski, Serge Gainsbourg and Giles Edward Palmer. The critique of our materialistic society is pretty obvious. However, I was in the right mood for something more straightforward. The originality of the story also exists mostly due to the book but still, great idea to adapt this philosophically-packed story to the screen for those of us who have time to read but always find pretexts not to.9,40 out of 10 from me.",Nocturnal Animals

225,chiguy17,"From an artist, but NOT art (or tasteful).",1,8 June 2018,"I read most of the reviews before watching the film, and assumed it was just a bunch of uptight people from ""flyover"" states. I was wrong. I watched this because Tom Ford did such a great job on the aesthetic beauty/cinematography and tenderness of ""A Single Man""; assuming his follow up project would be similar (at least in style/taste). I could not have been more wrong. It was graphic and disturbing to the point that, had I not known Tom Ford had written & directed, I would have thought it was the product of a very disturbed mind. I still don't know what could have possessed him to imagine and write this. I don't know what the point of the opening sequence with the nude, morbidly obese ""art show"" was - it seemed like it was just for shock factor rather than any sort of artistic or body image commentary, given the fact Tom Ford made Colin Firth lose weight for ""A Single Man"". I don't want to get into any plot spoilers, but it made Law & Order: SVU look like a Rom-Com. I think the worst part is the sense of self-indulgence/self-importance of the film. There was an over abundance of drawn out ""reaction shots"" that just felt like a pretentious attempt at being artistic: Jake Gyllenhaal sitting naked on the side of the tub; Amy Adams inhaling overly dramatically long and deep while reading the manuscript (repeatedly). I really like Tom Ford and the bulk of his work (fashion and otherwise), but I hope that he either retires from filmmaking or once again embraces the thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and... ""spirit"" that made "" A Single Man"" such a bittersweet pleasure.",Nocturnal Animals
226,tyson-hunsaker,A stylistic and shallow mess.,5,24 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals tackles a narrative challenge in telling three different stories interwoven together to create a portrait of a emotional experience. As our protagonist (played by Amy Adams) reads a disturbing story written by her ex-husband, we see their back story and by what means they're no longer together. The films manages to keep its narrative not only clear but intensely gripping despite the difficult undertaking of managing three separate stories. I felt thoroughly fixated on every scene wondering how all these stories would end and eventually tie together. The scenes involving the most violent and menacing content were extremely effective and were handled with the utmost seriousness and realism. Those scenes truly do frighten and chill. Much of the scare is also due to some incredible performances by Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron-Taylor Johnson, and especially by Michael Shannon. Personally, these stellar performances by the cast make this movie captivating to watch since the cast fully utilized their potential.All that being said, what makes this film fail on a personal level has to do with unfulfilled potential in the script. Not to be confused the movie is written quite well but payoff for everything bizarre that's happening was exceptionally unsatisfying. Yes, the ending is intentionally ambiguous but not apparent substance or ""why"" I was really watching this wasn't visible in the least. The whole ""style over substance"" issue was apparent from the bizarre opening credits and the ending which seemed to indicate that not only do we as the audience not know why but the filmmakers maybe didn't know either. It felt as if the beginning went nowhere, the middle went everywhere, and the end made a u-turn back to nowhere. With a film that really didn't have much to say, it's hard to recommend this to anyone who really values a good 2 hours. For someone looking to pass the time, it might be worth seeing at least once for some amazing performances and carefully crafted and layered narrative. However, it's not enough to make up for the lack of any substance or intention behind the movie.",Nocturnal Animals

So no more describing something as very unique or so unique. Unique is an adjective describing a noun, and it's a word that stands alone. Something is either unique or it's not unique which means it's been seen before. There are no quantitative measures for uniqueness, no stages no charting. This is true.

Ever regret messing up or squandering what could have been the love of your life at some point in your life? That's where this film smarts and hurts and reaches its true poignancy. I'd say it will touch a lot of nerves and whilst it can't be felt as a happy or uplifting film, it's skill and it's power to move is hard to deny.

229,warthogjump,"Amazing direction and acting, but falling short of greatness",8,20 November 2016,"I will be quick to admit that the tension throughout the film was immense, the directing was essentially perfect, and the acting from all of the 'supporting' actors extraordinary. Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing as usual, but it was Michael Shannon and Aaraon Taylor Johnson stealing the scenes. In particular, the first scene Aaron Johnson is in is purely mesmerizing, whereby he manifests a very believable daunting and fearful character, whereas Shannon shines in every scene with no single scene being a stand out.Now for the cons: Amy Adams does not do much at all. In fact, it is easily understandable how she has been working on so many projects given her limited screen time as a 'lead' actress, not to mention many of her scenes are essentially her repeated emotional reactions to the script written by her ex husband Edward. Her acting in this film is nothing outstanding, but that is mostly because she didn't really have the opportunity to prove anything. Another shortfall which some may like is that the film is very open ended, and by very I mean very! There is a lot left to the viewer's interpretation.And the final shortcoming, inherently related to the open ending, is that the film spends something of almost 2 hours building an immense amount of tension with beautiful acting and direction, but yet, there is no climax. Understandably, many will outline this as its 'achievement', but not in my books. For a film that builds so much tension throughout, very successfully indeed, and simply drops the ball on an ending so open ended even a person with the most vivid imagination would find difficulty in attaching a 'climatic' ending to it, it really is an unfortunate waste.Certainly not the film of the year, which may (and should) get some recognition for supporting actors and directing, but nothing more.Watch it for the acting and directing, but don't expect too much of the end (I do appreciate it is based on the book which the director would not have wanted to veer too far from).Looking forward to see Amy Adams in Arrival with hopefully a bit more closure and justified tension.7.5/10",Nocturnal Animals

There is the main character, Susan, who is just gorgeous in every scene.

Her routine is all abput hanging out with rich people, and convincing them to buy ugly and nasty modern art from the gallery she manages.But she remembers that once in her life she had a husband with a more conventional worldview. He is awriter, and gives her this book which imagines his life whether they stuck together and raised their own family.

He is just a down to earth guy, who happens to be in a situation that he is not prepard to deal.

In the book, Edward attempts to be strong, but it is so hard to be the opposite of your true nature. In the end the movie is a depiction of how woman hurt men who love them and care about them when they choose the strong, wealthy (and unfaithful) just because they can priovide them the status of trophy wife.And in the end,the result is she (Susan) is the unhappy one.

235,parleon-thedon,Nocturnal Animals - review: Graphic Realism or Design,8,27 November 2016,"Nocturnal Animals, I've been anticipating this movie for quite some time. Director Tom Ford who also directed ""A Single Man"" (which is great by the way) is a director on the rise. The trailers for Tom Ford's current project ""Nocturnal Animals"" have been very appealing.My predictions/hopes before watching the movie were as follows: 1. I wanted realism 2. I wanted suspense 3. I wanted character depth and emotion 4. I wanted violenceThe movie was good, I really liked it. It gave me everything I wanted. However, I wanted more. I wanted more, but during the runtime, I felt moments of heartbreak, sadness, anger, hatred, fear, and exhilaration.The context of ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a bit scrambled. Understanding the movie is difficult. I highly recommend viewers watch the movie a second time so that they can fully grasp its concept. The Good: The performances from the actors were spellbinding. Watching Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson on screen was captivating. The actors had immersed themselves in their roles. I believed every actor's performance during the duration of the movie. However, Michael Shannon's performance had stuck out to me the most. Shannon's character was mesmerizing and menacing. I instantly fell in love with Shannon's character performance. I hope that Michael Shannon gets nominated for ""Best Supporting Actor"" at the Oscars.Cinematography: I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Every frame of the movie was clearly handled with care. The photo images were exceedingly well-crafted.The Directing: Tom Ford is an attention to detail kind of director. He crafts his movies with a careful eye. No object goes unnoticed. Viewers should watch the movie with a mindful eye. If you're not aware you're going to miss something.Musical Score: The score is great. I like movie scores. The score sets the tone for the movie. When I heard this movie's score, I was enthralled. Dark, bleak, ominous, and alluring is how I would best describe it. I'll definitely be adding the ""Nocturnal Animals: Motion Picture Soundtrack"" to my music collection.The Tone: Heartrending, this movie is heartrending. Intensity is present throughout from all angles. Graphic realism is the focal point here. At times the movie felt a bit slow, and so at times I caught myself dozing off. Was the movie's content too heavy for me to bear? Was the movie's story execution moving too slow for me to sincerely keep my eyes open? When I look at all the angles, I say to myself, ""Yes. All the things that I had just mentioned ultimately ruined the movie for me.""The Bad: Some scenes go on far too long. One scene that I have in mind is very excruciating, the scene is good, but it just goes on for far to long. I'm interested in the story, the scene is captivating, I want to know what's going to happen eventually, but for the love of god can this scene just end already!The Bad - pt.2: Some scenes are just present for shock value. This movie had some things in it that didn't make any sense. The first scene my mind draws from in the movie is its opening. The Opening scene was great, it had good music, it had style, the imagery will forever be embedded in my mind, but the scene didn't make any sense, and it honestly didn't have any meaning whatsoever. Another scene that my mind draws from is a scene with Amy Adams, Jena Malone, and a phone. There's a brief flash image during the scene, that's it, it makes sense, I know what it means, but why is it there. One, two, or three characters are a part of the story, but they all just untimely disappear with no real conclusion. Final Thought: I understood the parallels between the fictitious novel and the nonfiction characters within the story. I liked how the novel drew on the events that happened during the characters real lives. The events played out in the novel were simultaneously corresponding with the events of the nonfiction characters.Overall, I enjoyed this movie for what it was. It's an ""Art House"" movie with captivating performances, great cinematography, attention to detail, enthralling music, and a transfixed general narrative. I didn't love this movie, but I thought it was good. I would recommend this for people who like all of the things I just mentioned.Final Grade: B+",Nocturnal Animals

I like how the novel unfolds over several years, and ties in with the regrets over the decisions that the Amy Adams character made over her life.

237,twhiteson,Jilted lover's fantasy,3,13 November 2020,"Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"" is the cinematic telling of a broken-heart's fantasy of: ""He/she will regret this!"" as to their former partner's unilateral break-up of their relationship.Nearly two decades prior to the start of the film, ""Susan Morrow"" (Amy Adams) dumped her ineffectual, wannabe novelist, first husband ""Edward"" (Jake Gyllenhaal) in brutal fashion. She chose her much more ambitious, successful and Ken-doll handsome lover ""Hutton"" (Armie Hammer) over Edward. Plus, to make a clear-cut finish, she with Hutton's support aborted Edward's child. The only reason she gave Edward for destroying him: ""I am unhappy."" (How many marriages/relationships have been ended by those three words?)Now married to the once super-successful Hutton, Susan is even unhappier. Despite appearances, both her marriage and financial security are on shaky grounds. Feeling neglected and lost, she is intrigued when she receives the manuscript of Edward's first novel which is also dedicated to her. Alone in her palatial modern home, she proceeds to read the manuscript and finds herself increasingly disturbed by its sadistic story which is seemingly a parable of her break-up with Edward.The supposed irony of ""Nocturnal Animals"" is that Susan, despite being the main character, is a villain. She's a horrible person who did something monstrous to a good man for selfish and frivolous reasons.The most telling scene is a flashback featuring a cameo by Laura Linney playing Susan's Hollywood stereotype of a Republican country-club dowager mother. Dressed in true Stepford Wife fashion, Susan's mother warned her not to marry Edward. Susan was appalled by this especially when her mother described Edward as ""too weak"" for her. As we learn, though, the mother was correct and that she, not Susan, had Edward's best interests at heart. Knowing her daughter, she knew that Susan would eventually tire of Edward and turn on him. She also knew that Edward would be destroyed by that betrayal. We're supposed to be surprised that Susan is the antagonist and that her mother, despite the trappings of being a rich, stuck-up B, is one of the film's few ""good guys.""So, why three stars? I thought this was terrifically acted especially by the magnificent Mr. Gyllenhaal who has dual roles as both the hapless Edward and the main character of his novel. I was also amused by the casting of Isla Fisher as the wife character in the novel because we're supposed to initially see her as a stand-in for Susan. It's funny because Ms. Fisher admits that she is often mistaken for Amy Adams due to their close physical resemblance. However, I didn't like the movie.I found it sadistic especially the disturbing recreation of Edward's novel. Yes, it's meant to make the viewer uncomfortable, but I resented it. Plus, west Texas rednecks as the bad guys? Really? Why didn't they just set it in northern Georgia with ""Deliverance's"" ""squeal like a pig"" rednecks? Plus, the cinematic pretensions especially the opening and ending scenes are eye-rolling.I also didn't like it because it hit a bit too close to home. I had my own ""Susan"" and, like many, have been on the receiving end of: ""I am unhappy."" One would think that I'd enjoy a revenge fantasy of a jilted lover coming true, but that's just it: it isn't true. It's a movie. A fantasy. An artsy melodrama. And not a satisfactory one at that. Just arthouse, cinematic pretentions wrapped-up in Hollywood smugness.",Nocturnal Animals
238,Nobody-27,Barely watchable,2,11 February 2018,"The film itself deserves no stars; the performances in some scenes, thanks to a great cast - between 7 and 10 stars. But performances great story do not make, hence generous 2 stars for the entire experience.
The film is a story within a story (as if you didn't know that already), and is based on too many unbelievable premises that it is hard to get into it. However, being master of popular tastes, Tom Ford knows what it takes to take the gullable and draw them in: give them lots of empty space (as in - loooong shots where everyone is silent), frame it with style and let the viewer see whatever they want in it.
Nocturnal Animals is stylish, dark, slightly warped and so slow that moves at glacial pace. You can watch it with your finger on the FF button and save yourself lots of pain from waiting for ""what will happen next?"" It is also ""slow"" as in - stupid. Not a hint of intelligence in it. I would have to disclose some major spoilers, but let's just say that many scenes do not make much sense, unless we assume that protagonists have IQ in single digits.

239,fxdx4,A subtle film that relies on a masterful director,8,27 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals is well acted and film that avoids the pitfalls of many thrillers. Amy Adams plays Susan, a depressed art gallery owner who must confront the choices she has made in her life when her ex-husband (Gyllenhaal) sends her a novel dedicated to her. The story plays out in 3 story lines, we have Susan in the present, the story she reads (which Isla Fisher who looks so much like Adams that I thought the actress did double duty until I saw the credits) and flashbacks to her past relationship with the author of the novel. Each individual story is fairly cliché, but the blend of them works, and the acting and directing of Tom Ford makes this a compelling and chilling film.Nocturnal Animals takes a long time to get rolling. Adams carries the first part of the film. It is hard to relate to a rich, depressed, beautiful woman, but Adams is both cold and icy and sympathetic at the same time. We don't get full narratives, only hints about her life, and I wish Ford gave us just a touch more. We anticipate, we walk down plot paths, but sometimes I wish the audience was better rewarded.When Adams starts to read the novel, the story takes on a more traditional thriller narrative, but is haunted by the other plot points. The intertwining narrative style of storytelling that has become so popular the last 15 years does not apply here, and is fresh and unique. Ford uses hard cuts and fast scene cuts to allow the audience to see/feel the connections, and this directing leads the watcher to the finer plot points of the story. Miss those and the movie loses its hold.Watch this movie and say, ""ohh the plot is cliché and the characters wooden"", watch this and say ""I didn't get it, or what's the point of this"", ""watch this and say, boring!"" – I won't disagree with you, but I watched it and said, ""wow, clever plot, well-acted, subtle and compelling filmmaking which the director gets the credit.",Nocturnal Animals

243,RLTerry1,"A meta-thriller that is equally shocking, seductive, bizarre, and beautiful",7,9 December 2016,"Tom Ford's adaptation of the best-selling novel Tony and Susan (1993) will either repulse or intrigue you from the opening credit sequence. There is definitely a pronounced shock value in this cinematic erotic mystery that includes an incredible amount of symbolism and theming just eager to be interpreted and dissected. Not typically found in mainstream cinema, the avant-garde seems to be the inspiration for many films this year. Nocturnal Animals is one of those films that is destined for discussion in a film or media studies graduate class. With solid acting, writing, and cinematography, you will be sucked into this twisted mystery within the world that the wealthy live in and the real world that most of us live in. You will likely find yourself thinking about what everything means, how it might apply to you, or simply appreciate non-linear storytelling. Although the film certainly rests upon the flashback as a chief storytelling method, Ford plays his cards right and creates a film in which all three stories are equally interesting. You may have heard it said– even by me–that some good movies are poor films; but, this is a case of a good film but a poor movie. That is usually the case with films that fall into the artistic or avant-garde stylistic way of conducting a visual story that contains a strong emotional impact.Cognitive cinema. Focus Features' Nocturnal Animals is one of those films that requires higher thinking in order to truly appreciate the symbolism and theming. Not that it cannot be enjoyed as a beautifully dark and disturbing story, but there is so much that can be analyzed in this film. From the sequence of obese nude females dancing with sparklers, ringmaster hats, and cheerleader regalia to the reoccurring imagery of crosses and death–both in terms of emotional and physical– director Tom Ford provides audiences with a film that can only be characterized as a mystery that is meta-thriller meets hints of erotica. Even now, I am analyzing the symbolism and theming as I write this review. There are so many elements to talk about. And I think that is the best part about a movie like this. Don't watch it alone. Not because it is too intense or scary but because you will want to talk to someone about the theming or emotional commentary. I find myself with a deep desire to analyze the film with someone, but none of my friends or colleagues have seen it yet. Visually driven. Even without the dialog, Ford's Nocturnal Animals can be understood through the imagery in and of itself. Trace amounts of Tom Ford's legacy as a high fashion designer can easily be seen in the design of this film. And I am not just talking about Adams' stunning wardrobe and hair/makeup. In many ways, this film–as a whole–is symbolic of high fashion clothing. It can be read in some of the same ways fashion is read and appreciated. Because this is only the second feature length film from Ford, there are elements of the story that give the impression that his talent for visual storytelling is still in the development process as there are times that his method of directing is that of an observant student or scholar of cinema.There are three distinct narrative threads in this film. (1) is the main story that we open up to at the interpretive and conceptual art exhibit establishing Susan, her gallery, her husband, and lavish lifestyle (2) is the narrative of her first husband Edward Sheffield (Gyllenhaal)'s novel Nocturnal Animals and (3) is the story of the rise and fall of the relationship between Susan and Edward. Juggling three plots is no easy task. Contrary to how it may appear, the narratives are not confusing or incoherent. Each plays an important role in the overarching theme and story of the film. The incoherency is found in the interpretation and analysis of what everything means. It's as if the film is providing the audience with puzzle pieces that can be arranged to depict something different for everyone. Perhaps you want to read the film as commentary on the relationship between Susan and Edward. Maybe you view it as symbolic of the estranged relationship between Susan and her current husband. Or maybe the novel is self-reflexive of the life Susan has created for herself.Each story is stylized in such a way that they complement one another–do not necessarily correlate or match each other, but the narratives are complementary. Although the audience is asked to draw their own respective conclusions to the story, presumably Susan's once lavish and charmed life will continue to rot and crumble as her husband is likely cheating on her just like she cheated on Edward. Still, there is a lot left up to interpretation in the best possible way. The Roger Ebert website review of this film commented that there are parallels between this film and Alice Through the Looking Glass. Fascinating take on this film. That is probably the best analogical interpretation of Nocturnal Animals. Looking at the film in such a way that Susan is Alice and the two other narrative threads are her adventures in Wonderland opens a whole new window through which to view the events as they unfold. On the surface level, there is a clear theme of revenge woven throughout the plot. This is indicated by a painting that catches Susan's attention on her way to a board meeting. The metaphysical thrilling aspect to the subplot of revenge is the revenge the past has on the present and the present on the past. In a manner of speaking, Susan is listed by ghosts of her past, present, and future. Okay, perhaps not in the same way Scrooge was visited, but there are certainly some commonalities.",Nocturnal Animals
244,bodhi-13262,There's a fine line between Justice & Revenge..,8,28 February 2017,"'Nocturnal Animals' is a tale within a tale by writer/director Tom Ford. Some may think this film is absurd and maybe a bit unorthodox, but what happens when you begin to look beyond the surface?1. To start, I must warn audience that the opening credits of this film is utterly atrocious. Please don't consider this as a spoiler rather than a reason to skip 3mins ahead. The opening sequence depicts obese women dancing in a transitional slideshow as part of an art display. I for one almost switched off the TV by that alone, but I'm glad I stuck with it cause there's a rather exceptional film to be seen once you get past the opening. So aside from that, this is a surprisingly good film. People may get bored since there is a slow pace throughout, but the gripping nature of the sheer thriller that plays out is worth the watch.2. The plot is rather intricate as we early on find the film's central figure Susan (Amy Adams), receive a letter from her ex- husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal), which contains a draft of his first book. As she begins reading, the book's story plays out as nearly a separate film as it's premise depicts a man who's wife and child are kidnapped along a deserted Texan highway. Amy Adams may be the main figure who the audience follows, but Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of the best performances of his career in this dual role. Since his story on both sides deals with loss, Gyllenhall emotes the most as we watch his character have mental and emotional breakdowns.3. Someone who deserves an equal amount of praise for his performance is Michael Shannon, who plays Detective Andes, that undertakes Jake Gyllenhaal's case with a passion in the book. His determination and sheer focus on finding the bad guys makes him a force to be reckoned with. As far as the book's premise goes, Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrays the antagonist to a despicable point and you can't help but hate him as the story plays out more and more. The film as a whole has an underlying theme of both regret and revenge, which comes to focus the more it progresses. Once again, it (for the most part) keeps you engaged.4. As far as flaws go, there are other interesting side characters introduced throughout, but there is little to no development to them. Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen and Laura Linney all make appearances, but they have less than or up to 5mins of screen time. The most blatant thing for people who watch this movie, is gonna be the ending. I was a bit lost by the time the ending came, but only after some web research was I able to fully understand it. This can be a problem for some. The story of the book comes full-circle, but it's obvious there are things in the real world that are left unrealized or without a proper conclusion. Hats off to Tom Ford because this was easily one of my favorite films of 2016. This deserves to be seen, not only for it's superb style and editing, but for the outstanding stories and performances which propel this movie close to being great.",Nocturnal Animals

An anger that belongs to herself, some dark agenda, not her characters. Beautiful and yet she feels a little out of that body. I don't see her sexuality as quite open but instead a complicated driven engine that has gotten her so far and yet... we are not here to talk about her. Who else. The director. Writer.
I have enough problems so my sixth sense tells me about movies that I should avoid and see at a distance... Eighteen years for Moulin Rouge. I was right.

It's very good. First of all , yes it is very artful but that doesn't bother much when you have got rich symbolism and clear cut beautiful cinematography coupled with haunting score. The characters are great and even great is the work done by the actors. There are two narratives. One is of real time and another is of a novel. And both are great. While the first one teases a sense of realism and promises and delivers little character development, it's the second narrative that's thrilling , sad and gripping. It's about failed relationship , regrets and the novel inside the film which is read by Susan , Amy Adams character boasts a terrific story which will hook you up right from the start and will end with a devastating finish. Moreover , the film is watchable and I can a great work. As a normal film-goer I do not understand art or very high standard of film making , I just enjoy movies and look where I can understand something. And yes I do find rich symbolism in this movie , particularly how wrong decisions and a different or perhaps repentful path of life is symbolized by the story of the novel. As it goes for the title , I can't think of anythink else. Amy Adams as always is great although for awards Arrival has a bit more edgy performance by her. Jake Gyllenhal and Michael Shannon are terrific. Perhaps Aaron Taylor Johnson is the ultimate surprise with a negative role of a disgusting person. I believe this is his career's best performance so far. At last , as a thriller movie it stand out with some different style but it's good to be different sometimes.

A lot of people were disappointed with the ending, but you have to think about it for awhile to realize it's a sort of poetic/philosophical movie. The whole time everyone's telling Edward he's weak and sensitive. So he writes a book for his ex wife. In the book his wife and daughter are murdered by these terrible hooligans and the whole time he's trying to get revenge. He does and then immediately dies. Because of how well the book is written, his ex wife starts getting feelings for him again and reaches out to meet him. He stands her up and it ends. That's the movie. Sounds average. But break it down. The book is him getting stronger; it's not his wife and daughter getting murdered, it's Edward's weakness dying and his ex wife would be the murderers giving him reasons to get stronger. In the book, he spends time mourning and fantasizing about revenge. He finally gets his revenge and accidentally kills himself. How perfect is that? A part of Edward had to die to get over his ex and he wanted her to know. Now she finally wants him again and he's orchestrated this entire book/plan to just stand her up and prove that she's the weak one.

253,rblenheim,"A disturbing, provocative masterpiece that will stay in your mind",10,22 February 2017,"The main title sequence of ""Nocturnal Animals"" of grotesquely obese naked women with credits superimposed upon them might find you chastising me for recommending this film. Stick it out. What follows is a visually ravishing and provocative triumph of visionary filmmaking that is one of the great films of 2016.Directed by Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion designer Tom Ford (and adapted by Ford from Austin Wright's 1993 novel, Tony and Susan), this is a multi-layered 'story within a story' that will disturb viewers while cementing them to their seats. The main framing narrative follows a wealthy art gallery owner named Susan (Amy Adams at her least bubbly) whose second marriage is falling apart as apathy and depression consume her boring life. The actual story begins when she receives a book manuscript by her ex-husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) whom she had left 19 years earlier, a novel pinned with a note asking for her to provide feedback. As she reads, the film takes us directly into the novel itself which turns out to be a violent neo-noir thriller revolving around a man (also Gyllenhaal) whose vacation with his family has turned deadly and has driven him to hire a detective (played by Michael Shannon in arguably the finest performance of his career to date) as his world slips into inexorable nightmare. The film cleverly mixes the two narratives as Adams (along with the audience) attempts to piece together parallels between the fictional novel and her own life. In each of the two narratives director Ford exhibits a perfect merging of style with theme: Its framing story displays the polished visual opulence of the director's background in fashion design with a deliberately measured pacing in its editing; in contrast, the inner narrative embraces the sordid, grimy visual ugliness of an roughhewn pulp novel while employing a more forceful rhythm in the editing. The effect is as if a stately Bruckner symphonic movement were invaded by poly-tonal tone clusters from a Charles Ives piece.Director Ford has said, ""(a film) can be entertaining, but if you leave the theater and it doesn't stay with you, doesn't haunt you, doesn't challenge you, then it's not successful."" ""Nocturnal Animals"" succeeds by these standards beyond his wildest dreams. When I first saw it, I left the theater staggering as though hit by a brickbat. Since then it has stayed in my mind and continues to haunt me, even as I write this review now.",Nocturnal Animals
254,d_carlotaj,The Morally Bereft:. Seekers of Status and Wealth,10,19 January 2021,"""Nocturnal Animals,"" (2026). Starring Amy Adams, Jake Gyllendaal, and Michael Shannon. Directed by Tom Ford (screenplay). From the novel by Austin Wright.
This film's theme is morality and the lack of it in our daily lives. I forget where exactly I learned this, probably in an Anthropology class, but reiterated in an English class by a professor who believed that the most common motivating drive in the human being was sex. The other innate drives were survival (food, shelter), status, wealth, and power. This particular story is about women and a desire for status and wealth. The protagonist in NA is Susan Morrow, a wealthy art dealer. She is smart enough to detect her mother's weakness for the security of wealth and status and her compromises to attain it. But Susan does not have the convictions of her beliefs. She succumbs to taking the easy way to achieve her goals, a hallmark of wealthy people who adjust their morals to suit their ends. So what we have is a person who is a nocturnal animal who hides her motives in darkness, definitely not a mark of true class. The other characters are nocturnal predators who have no qualms about their actions or limits to them and their crassness. So we have an interlacement of the adminatio device of class/crass. The difference between the wealthy morally bereft and the lower class is the openness of action. When Susan ditches her high classed partner, she slashes his ego unmercifully. She even goes so far as to betray her own womanhood by aborting his child because of its inconvenience. She later slashes her new lover's ego when he's having financial problems. She's like a flea, jumping from a drowning dog to a floating log after log, to put it crassly. Ray ditches her but doesn't tell her why. Edward/Tony does tell her, in so many words. He gives her a chance to let his lesson sink in. But it is too late, as he warned her before their breakup. The imagery of lewdness and crassness is contrasted with the discernment, discretion, and sensitivity of class throughout the film. The relationship between Tony and Bobby is a mirror image of men who are morally and psychologically alike. And who find a way to bring about justice and moral cognizance.
This film is important and reaffirms the necessity of living by a strict moral code, giving up vanity in our daily lives.

256,LittleLotti,Tries way too hard,5,5 October 2017,"Sigh. Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed in Nocturnal Animals if the trailers hadn't construed it as some twisted thriller instead of the character study it really is. Tom Ford apparently thinks his audience is too dense to figure the obvious out on their own, as he practically beats you over the head with his ""cleverness."" Firstly the film'a style seems forced which makes it come off as pretentious. There is nothing subtle about this movie. In one scene Susan is looking at a giant mural that says ""Revenge"" and talks to a coworker about it. I enjoy movies where you catch subtleties throughout, like why couldn't there just be a small picture in the background somewhere that said Revenge? I feel like every time something important was said or shown Ford felt like he had to point it out so that even the dumbest viewer could have it laid out for them. This movie is in no way a thriller. The beginning was intense, but afterwards I felt nothing for any of the characters. It was like both story lines were too uninteresting on their own, and Ford couldn't let the rest of us figure out in our own how the two were related. This isn't a bad movie, I just think it was marketed as something it's not, and doesn't deserve all the hype it's received. I think a lot of people just follow mob mentality, and will claim something a masterpiece just because that's how it was presented.",Nocturnal Animals
257,bartonj2410,This devilishly stylish thriller left me in a trance,10,16 October 2016,"Nocturnal Animals is a dark and devilishly stylish thriller from Tom Ford, who knows a thing or two about style having worked as creative director for both Gucci and Yves Saint Lauren in the past. It could have been in danger of being a case of style over substance however, Ford's perfectionism makes this one of the most powerful films I've seen all year.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is an art gallery owner who spends most of her life at home alone, with her husband often out of town on business. When Susan receives a manuscript to a novel written by her ex-husband, Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), she finds herself immediately engrossed.As Susan continues to read the novel, she has flashbacks to how her relationship with Edward broke down as well as thoughts that the violent thriller is a veiled threat against her from Edward.I didn't know what to expect from Nocturnal Animals as I hadn't seen any trailers and Ford's film ended up blowing me away. The way Ford tells the story showcases how inventive and powerful he is as a filmmaker, the narratives of both Susan's life and Edward's novel combining brilliantly and leaving me in a trance like state.Edward's novel provides the film with its dark soul, the story of Tony Hastings (also played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and his family who run into trouble when travelling through the night on the road to their country home. It's pretty heavy stuff but it plays an essential part in making this such powerful viewing.This is a gorgeous film to look at as well, Seamus McGarvey's cinematography echoing the story's bleakness and the brutality of Edward's supposed veiled threat to Susan. The combination of the visuals with Abel Korzeniowski's dream-like score heightens the sense of escapism felt by Susan as she reads Edward's novel.Coming to the performances, Nocturnal Animals features a very impressive ensemble cast all at the top of their game. Amy Adams yet again proves why she's one of the most versatile actresses with a performance that combines the assurance of an art gallery owner with the vulnerability of someone who knows they've made mistakes in their past. With this and Arrival out in the coming months, expect to see Adams get some form of recognition come the awards season, maybe for both.Adams is joined by Jake Gyllenhaal, who takes on dual roles yet again for this film. Gyllenhaal has really grown as an actor, particularly in the last five years, and its great to see him continue that in Nocturnal Animals, more notably in the role of Tony Hastings, a creation of his other character Edward. The rest of the cast features a scene stealing Michael Shannon, who I've really grown to appreciate these last few years, a career best performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is truly vile as the villainous Ray, and Laura Linney who, even in the short space of time we see her, makes one hell of an impact.I cannot speak highly enough of Nocturnal Animals, a stylish thriller that has more than enough substance to it. I will definitely be checking out Tom Ford's A Single Man after this and I sure as hell hope we see more work from Ford in the future.",Nocturnal Animals

The beauty is here, and Animals is certainly a gorgeous film to watch. The look is right, and the score is lush. It's a shame that for all the individual accomplishments such efforts add up to become such a thorough snoozefest.I would describe the plot, introduce the characters, etc., although for the most part all I can gather is that the movie is about Amy Adams reading a book with great intensity. The book itself, of course titled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" is a murder mystery written by her estranged ex-husband (Jake Gyllenhaal). Written as a manuscript on the verge of publication, Adams (her character is named Susan) reads the book in the bathtub, on the couch, in front of a fire, in her bed, etc. The emotions it draws out of her cause many reactions of shock, of horror, as she continually has to pause mid-sentence to let out a sigh and remove her glasses. This continues for the majority of the film. What a chore it is to be a wealthy woman reading a book. When she isn't reading, she is a failing artist whose most recent gallery featured life-like statues of obese women in the nude. Speaking of which, the opening credits to this film are quite an eyeful.The novel itself follows a man (again portrayed by Gyllenhaal) who gets pulled over on a lonely Texas highway by a group of men who are anything but friendly. In a scene of building tension, they are kidnapped and unspeakable circumstances befall the man, who gets involved with the law in attempts to track down the criminals. He works with a sheriff, played so aptly by Michael Shannon, who works outside of the law to save the day in the end. If it weren't such a travesty of a movie I would bet money that Shannon had a likely chance of receiving a Supporting Actor nomination at the upcoming Oscars. He's that good.At the conclusion of the novel, after Adams has run out of breath to sigh and warm baths to take, she contacts her ex in hopes of meeting him to discuss the book. So leads to an ending that is just as contrived as the rest of the film. It's a level of pretentiousness that I could sense with ""A Single Man"" and still admired for it's boldness. Here, in a story that precariously balances 2 or 3 stories simultaneously, it's a traffic jam of tone and theme. I can understand how there are interpretations to be made about the book, it's metaphors in regards to murder and abortion (there's a lot of plot I have failed to cover), revenge and healing. I don't blame Tom Ford entirely for the film being so convoluted, however when you see that he wrote, produced, and directed the picture, we have to draw the line somewhere, don't we?",Nocturnal Animals
259,paulmcuomo,"Duel narrative movie; one good one, one fairly dull one",8,8 November 2016,"Tom Ford is possibly one of the best new directors when it comes to visual style; only Nicholas Winding-Refn really out of newer directors really has an eye for hyper-styled visual movies. A Single Man and this are fairly similar to this in terms of non-linear narrative used to explore character, and the colours are deep and rich, and both have dark themes. Without a doubt though, this movie is way more cynical and cruel than A Single Man, but in a way that's the pleasure of it.Now, don't get me wrong; A Single Man is deep and does have a particular way of flicking you the middle finger with the ending, but this just goes all out with the dark; there's depression, affairs, rape, murder, abortion and other things. The overriding themes of this novel are certainly revenge and ideas of masculinity, as portrayed by the movie's key character Edward Sheffield, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The film's narrative is two fold; in the secondary narrative, Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow, an art-dealer who previously wronged her ex-husband Edward, and then 20 years later receives a manuscript for a West Texas thriller novel 'Nocturnal Animals', which she interprets as a message to her. The novel makes up the second narrative, in which Tony Hastings (also Jake Gyllenhaal) is set upon by a group of Rednecks led by Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who rape and murder his wife and young daughter, and so he seeks revenge.OK, since this is a movie of two halves, I'll divide my opinion of it as such: the novel is easily the most interesting part of the movie, mainly for how what the novel is saying. It's an accusation against Susan, for Susan aborted Edward's child and married another man, and Tony has his wife and child raped and murdered, so the victimisation is there, plus the portrayal of Tony has being soft like Edward makes that equally apparent. This is easily the most engaging part of the film, with the best performances, particularly from Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon as an aging sheriff determined to bring him justice, and a terrifying performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who made me ALMOST forget he was the camp love interest from Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. Like I said, almost.That being said, the real-life portion is easily the weakest, and part of that is that Susan Morrow is a very flat character that Amy Adams is way overqualified for. The defining characteristic of Susan is that she's materialistic, but that's it. No actual character is there with dimension, and this makes the film's super-smart ending not a good payoff, which given the build-up is massively disappointing, especially when the film-making is so strong, and the main cast do some of the best work of their careers, I really thought this would be one of the best films of the decade. Sadly, it's not. Still, give it a watch, but be warned it's a hard sit.By the way, for the now infamously beautifully sickening opening scene that features morbidly obese women full-frontal dancing, I am struggling to find meaning in that. I am aware it's a vision that Susan has, but the movie could've done without that - it was bordering on pretentiousness and was off-putting with it, plus did make me feel slightly unwell. Be warned when you see this - and I encourage you do.",Nocturnal Animals

(They even now consider documentaries to be spoilable! LOL!). This is a film told in three concurrent sequences, one in the present day, one in the past, and one in a novel--but they essentially all have the same characters, even though some of them are disguised. It's a revenge movie, but more clever and complicated than most revenge stories. Although the film held my attention and was beautifully shot, ultimately it left a bad taste in my mouth because of the self-pitying nature of one of the characters plus a misogynistic opening scene that was in very poor taste. By the end of the movie I decided Tom Ford, the writer and director, has issues with women.",Nocturnal Animals

Are movie writers losing their creativity to put essence in the movie? Or do they just care how it was presented to viewers?People who put high scores are basically people who do not care about the essence or goal of a movie.

She floats through the movie as a hot red hed cardboard cut out image against beautiful nighttime backgrounds. Like a vampire she appears to only exist in darkness. Jake G is also quite 1 dimensional as the guilt-wracked wimp who couldn't stand up to the bad guys. His simmering rage and wish for revenge is poorly delivered, and his stupidity in plot is enormous.The bad guys are your typical stereotyped 'back woods Texan hicks' who cruise around in their hot rod making mayhem like A Clockwork Orange yet somehow are never caught. Their homicidal antics stretch the movie's believability to the breaking point, even though we know we are not watching reality but some bad author's cheap hack thriller.perhaps the only saving grace is brought in by the excellent Michael Shannon, who plays a rich complex character of the aging police detective suffering from lung cancer and looking for revenge before he dies against the type of scum bags he's had to let go his whole career.",Nocturnal Animals

It is an interesting story that jumping among reality, memories and fictional content. Without having creepy ghost, it can successfully present a strong thrilling atmosphere that I feel scary. That's the powerful words of the novel, so the lead actor decides to use it as revenge tool.In the movie, we can see human nature is extremely complicated. No one is totally compromising to be good, at the same time, no one is totally an evil. Those who seem kind and gentle are not always willing to grin and bear it without being violence. In other words, Susan thinks that Tony, who is always willing to give in, is not true.

Well they did a very bad job of whatever the hell they were trying to do. I thought at first it could be good but just went downhill all the way through. Hollywood does this a lot, make a movie with no substance and assume the audience is going to make something out of nothing. And a lot of reviews here did just that. Tried to find sophistication in something that was just done poorly. Amy Adams, what can I say. She could be in anything and there are many that will rave about her just for the appearance. I'm not going that route. She has been pretty boring to me and her staring into space that she does in all her movies just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Another rather repetitive move by Hollywood is to think they can throw anything together with good actors in it and it automatically will be a good movie. This movie was disjointed and empty. At the end I'm sitting there and going, ""what, how did I just sit through this"". Hollywood got me again, just wasted a couple more hours of my life. Thanks Hollywood.",Nocturnal Animals

Although you'll be far more likely to get carjacked, robbed and raped in multi cultural California or the tri-state area, here it is proposed that the ultimate danger in the U.S. is personified bys poor white folk a.k.a. white trash. Texas politics and its judicial system are also allegedly completely stacked against victims and function only to defend (white) criminals, even though, once again, California is in fact the state with the most corruption and that is thriving on aiding legally all sorts of criminals (illegal immigrants, murderers, looters). There are also some snide suggestions that rich Texans are sexist, racist, homophobic and their religion makes them ""bad"" people; the worst criticism is always reserved for catholicism, (not surprisingly). The reality is that Californians, are currently escaping to states like Texas, to flee the danger, disturbing demographic changes and financial despair that is looming large over its residents. In Texas people carry guns so they can defend themselves, and can prevent awful things from happening to people - that should be the lesson learnt in this film.

268,onlythusfar,Superficial,5,24 December 2016,"I found ""Skim Piff's"" review, entitled "" Nocturnal Animals misunderstands what its focus should be"" to be the most illuminating comment on why this movie/story didn't work well. I found the unnecessarily sensational parts of the film (from the novel within the film) to be too much in the fore, and as Mr. Piff says, it takes away from the character study, which seems to be the intent of the film. Also, I think ""love"" is portrayed in an adolescent manner, with a man obsessing over his ""lost sweetheart"" for twenty years, even though in reality, she was/is a very superficial, immature person, who was/is incapable of supporting a real loving relationship. To hold on to his longing for this woman for so long is very unrealistic, or indicates, that Edward has a serious psychological disability. This sort of ""undying love"" pulls at our sentimentality, but looked at critically it only indicates stunted emotional development on the part of the obsessive lover. Also, the supposedly ""great novel"" the ex-husband has written, comes across, as tawdry exploitative melodrama, with no subtlety or human realism. This film reminds me of ""Gone Girl"", an over-hyped slice of sleazy nihilism. I don't know if this was the responsibility of the film-makers or of the source material. The imagery was bold and interesting and the music was beautiful, although it was used in a terribly manipulative manner.

273,punishable-by-death,"Incredinbly unique, but not perfect",8,11 November 2016,"Given his background, director Tom Ford's second film is surprising in that it is not a case of style over substance - there isn't too anything flashy for the most part, but the entire film has a subtle stylish quality to it, which flows into the cinematography and the colours used. Added to this though is a gritty, violent thriller with a bit of dark humour thrown in for kicks.It is clear from the start of the film that Susan, a successful art gallery owner, isn't in a good place mentally. Christ, just look at the opening scene that accompanies the credits! She isn't sleeping, she is losing faith in herself and her career, and possibly her marriage. It is also established quickly that she is financially well-off.Without warning, a completed book is mailed to her by her ex-husband of 19 years, a man that she says she broke up with in a bad way. Cleverly, the film doesn't show us what that was specifically, instead it uses her ex's book as a sort of prop. The story Edward has written is a dark and violent vengeful tale. Julie takes this personally, and it is hard not to see why when we learn about the similarities in personality between the story's protagonist, Tony, and Edward himself.It is interesting to watch her reactions as she reads the story, with close-up shots, especially her eyes, showing a lot more than she could ever say. The further into the story she reads, the more it affects her mental well-being. I love the idea of a story within a story (film), which is obviously not a new trend, but this certainly offers a few twists on that basic formula.What lingers in my mind is how the film slowly reveals itself. The film will occasionally flashback to a moment when Susan was with Edward, and at first the scene won't make a ton of sense. Then later on an event or scene will cause that flashback to fit together, to tell another part of the story. The flashbacks are handled perfectly; Jake Gyllenhaal even looks younger during these scenes, and without the heavy Texan accent he has within the confines of a book, there is no confusion. We always know where we are within the movie.At first, I thought the ending was extremely premature. But after thinking about it for a bit, it makes perfect sense given the events that preceded it. A unique film to be certain. As for Amy Adams, this is two roles in a row that she has nailed, and each of those roles couldn't be more different. She even looks different here. Gyllenhaal doesn't let us down, unsurprisingly, and Michael Shannon serves as a fine grumbly old detective whose idea of the law becomes slightly warped as the film rolls by.Impressive, original and well-acted, there isn't a film I can think of to compare this to - which is an infinitely good thing. Stylish where needed and gritty when it counts, this is a multi-faceted film that needs to be seen more than once. And as most of us know, the films you need to watch more than once often end up becoming favourites. The only niggles I have are some aspects of the script and screenplay - a lot of the humour fell flat, and some very tense scenes were undone by some very predictable scenarios, as well as a script that is as sharp as a spoon. Still though, I sure as hell will be watching this one again soon.www.epilepticmoondancer.net",Nocturnal Animals

275,john_seater,Bad movie made worse by routine gratuitous left-wing hate,1,28 December 2016,"I would have awarded 3 stars, but then the routine left-wing hate emerged. I already was thinking of quitting the movie at that point because the plot was dumb and the characters dumber. The routine left-wing hate clinched it. It also dropped my rating to one star.The main character is a woman who divorced her first husband about 20 years earlier. For some reason, the jilted husband, who is a writer, sends her his novel and asks her opinion. Before she has a chance to open it, our heroine discovers that her current husband, who has gone to New York (I think it was New York) on a ""business"" trip, is cheating on her while on the trip. Our heroine's reaction to this news is to do what any intelligent woman would do: she curls up with her ex-husband's novel and starts to read it. The novel is a violent story not worth going into. For some reason our heroine finds it reminiscent of her own life. She thinks back to when she and her first husband had not yet married. She explains to him that her brother is a homosexual and because of that has been disowned by their parents. Our heroine explains that they did it because they are ""homophobic, racist, xenophobic,...Republican...""That did it for me right there. Did Hillary Clinton write the script, or did the script writer crib the idea from Hillary Clinton? Doesn't matter. I have no interest at all in listening to that kind of hate-filled drivel from an ignorant Hollywood script write who probably has never met a Republican. (Note: I am not a Republican.) The left, the party driven by greed, envy, and theft, has a hell of a nerve lecturing anyone about morality. This is the crowd that can't abide success and uses the police power of the state to punish it, taking money from those who have done something with their lives and giving it to those who haven't in order to buy the votes of the latter, who outnumber the former. This is the crowd that detests all traditional values, including religion, morality, patriotism, and honor, the crowd that wouldn't give The Passion the time of day much less an Academy Award because somehow it was a ""politically right-leaning"" movie. So the New Testament is a right wing document. Really? This is the crowd that wouldn't give ""An American Sniper"" the time of day much less an Academy Award (except for best music or something stupid like that) because it was supposedly a right-leaning movie when in fact it took no sides at all. This is the crowd that now does not like ""Hacksaw Ridge"" because its main character is driven by a strong commitment to Christianity.Dismissing all Republicans as racists and so on is one small reason the left got its head handed to it on a platter in the 2016 election, why it now controls literally no state houses in the entire South (where honor is an inextricable part of the culture), why it is reduced to childish tantrums yelling ""F*ck Donald Trump"", beating up Trump supporters, vandalizing property, and requiring coloring books and crayons to come to terms with its grief over having lost the election.Keep putting this kind of unthinking, hate-filled garbage in the scripts, and I will continue walking out of (or avoiding altogether whenever possible) the resulting product.So we have crummy movie whose main character is a moron who spews hate.

277,Ben_Cap,A Solid Thriller Disguised as a Romance,8,14 December 2016,"Leading up to the release of Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals I did not go out of my way to find out much about it. Not because I know Ford has a habit of surprising the viewer and not even because I myself wanted to be surprised. We live in the age of psychological thrillers and this one just sort of slipped under my radar, and once I started hearing about it more I just figured I would try to stay away from it as best as I can. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to see Nocturnal Animals, but it was my experience and I will give you my impressions based on that.There is an interesting story telling mechanic used in Nocturnal Animals that really got me excited, and this is not a spoiler alert because it is part of the basic premise of the movie. The opening scenes and some of the later ones take place in real life, showing Amy Addams as a somewhat unsatisfied artist in what seems to be a loveless marriage. The bulk of the movie depicts Amy Addams' character reading a book that has been sent to her by her ex-husband. The rest are memories of her life with her former husband and how they got into the position they are in now. All three different plots are well paced and each seem to reveal new information and answer questions from the other time lines, while asking some new ones.These types of movies have to set themselves apart, and this is a fantastic way for Nocturnal Animals to handle this. The real good plot stuff happens in the fictional book entitled ""Nocturnal Animals"", but the things that happen in the book seem to flesh out the characters in real life extremely well. In a genre that is constantly trying to confuse you, this is an appreciated way of keeping the story interesting without trying to twist my brain.The cast is tremendous, although some of the actors have better performances in this year alone. Amy Addams is one of the most consistent female actors in recent memory, and even though this did not feel like her strongest work, her bad days are better than most actors best days. Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a great performance and even though it will probably not even land him an Oscar nomination, it just helps to fill out an already growing and impressive filmography. Michael Shannon is one of my favorite actors working today and he is perfect for this role. I don't want to give much away but Mr. Shannon continues to shine and also builds on an impressive year.When all is said and done Nocturnal Animals is an entertaining movie that will cut a lot of viewers deep. Even though the writing is not amazing and the overall stakes of the movie are really just about two people, it is a well told story and has moments that will be tough to forget. Again in a sub genre that is pretty over saturated right now it can be difficult to stand out, Nocturnal Animals does a fine job of setting itself apart. Weather you relate to the characters in a personal way or if you had parents that went through separations this movie will find it's way into that dark part of your mind and stay there for the next few days.",Nocturnal Animals

That's all way back in the past, but then he writes a book about it and sends it to his new partner (Amy Adams), who's supposed to be a fancy gallery owner somewhere, looks like New York (which presumably explains the bizarre opening credits of obese strippers, a bit of performance art?). The book freaks her out, she presuming he's being allegorical and trying to tell her something. Maybe I'm missing something but I just didn't see the point of all that, it didn't add anything.

280,nazztrader,"He had it, then he let it go !",2,18 December 2016,"The first few minutes were great - why didn't Ford just keep going? He could have made a totally absurdist/surrealist film that might have worked! There were hints of such a film here and there - the guy sitting on the toilet outdoors, the ridiculous dress that looked like the main component was electrical tape, etc. If you want to ""challenge"" the audience, that would be one way to do it. As it stands, I don't know what he was trying to accomplish here.Another film that featured a novel being read is the little-known piece of soft-core Eurotrash called ""Honey""/""Miele di donna"" (1981), and while that didn't work either, one could easily figure out how it would have been a lot better. There were also bits and pieces that did work or at least were satisfying on some level. By contrast, I don't want to think about ""Nocturnal Animals"" any more - in fact, I was bored while I was watching it! The only thing one could do here, in my opinion, is to go into total absurdism - just present one bizarre scene after another, in a Felliniesque way.The reason why this film fails so badly is because it's clear that the Amy Adams character feels so deeply about the story she is reading is because she pictures her ex-lover as the main character. Now that certainly makes sense for her, but not for the audience, leading to boredom (because we think of the novel as simply fiction in this context) and in some cases outright comedy (the novel is sort of like ""Dirty Harry""/""Death Wish"" but with an unhappy ending, so it's not exactly special in any significant way). So we are left with a woman who ""has it all"" but decides that being among the ""1"" leaves something to be desired. Perhaps the next Ford film can be about Americans who don't have health insurance, if the new President gets his wish - at least I could feel sympathy for those people, even those who stupidly voted against their own self-interests. And the glowing reviews for this remind me to never trust ""professional reviewers."" Remember ""Eyes Wide Shut?"" Remember the glowing reviews for that one? That was worse than this film! And what about Woody Allen's recent films? We are living in ""world turned upside down"" times, with more people believing ""fake facts"" than obviously real ones, it seems (and opera singers who can't sing their roles, ""reality TV"" shows that clearly don't reflect reality, etc.). And that is when absurdism is needed most. Tom, call me if you want some help with your next film. You don't have to pay me or give me credit - I just want to see one director do something that speaks to the times. I think you are someone who can do that, but you appear to be too concerned about impressing the ""special people.""",Nocturnal Animals

It's disconcerting (usually, but not always, for the right reasons) and carries an intense atmosphere of icy sophistication that is both beautiful and brutal in the same breath.

As a dying cop at the end of his career, I'm not convinced vigilant shootings for a stranger would be a top priority.As others have noted, while the scenes seem to be going somewhere, the whole thing falls apart with too many backstory shifts along with ridiculous fillers of bourgeois emptiness.It's shallow, it's narcissistic and void of emotional depth. The audience is left hanging with characters that stir very little emotion connection. There is no on-screen tension or suspense between the characters either.No rhyme or reason to the closing scene. Perhaps Ford thinks he's mastered a creative or experimental ending but it just doesn't work. A better take on experimental endings of a similar genre is No Country for Old Men.

291,Anaslair,Pleasant surprise!,9,26 February 2017,"This movie was such a pleasant surprise. It was riddled with beauty and sorrow and I was just hypnotised throughout it.We are presented to Susan Morrow in such a subtle manner. We get a glimpse of her current life and then the action is interspersed with bits of her past as well as scene's from her ex-husband Edward's novel. Everything is just so smooth. You are presented with just enough to understand the dynamics in her life and what she and Edward have felt. Every scene is precious and engaging and I did not want the movie to end but at the same time I did because the tension was just so rich.Some images are quite shocking, starting with the opening one. The soundtrack is quite enthralling and, much like the narrative, it wraps up nicely towards the end. The sobriety of Amy Adams' character's look, as well as her surroundings, as well as other very clever scenes add to the dark atmosphere but not in a in-your-face sort of way. The film is just so well made. Everything comes together to produce an entrancing work of art. It is an intense and powerful movie with little clues scattered throughout that will make most sense towards the end but that you can definitely take with you and mull over.There were a couple of cheesy lines both in the 'real world' and the novel one but overall I am blown away by this movie and so glad I managed to watch it. The ending caught me off guard but once I digested it I saw it made sense.And the performances. Amy Adams stunned me and Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing as always but I absolutely have to mention Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. My goodness, they were stunning in their role. Pretty much everyone was superb, but these guys shone extra bright and I hope Shannon wins the Oscar. I will also definitely be looking out for more movies by Tom Ford.I hope you watch it.

294,rdolan9007,"Attractive and well constructed, and yet somehow an underwhelming film.",7,17 May 2018,"I did have my preconceptions of this film, which were based upon the mixed reviews of it. I had heard it was superficial, and yet others were lavishing praise upon it. The mixed reviews I confess attracted me to the film, and I wanted to see the side of the argument, I would come down upon.The positives first of all. It is beautifully filmed - it's slick, polished and the colours are luscious. It also has an astonishing beginning, which is one of those beginnings in where you go wow and are both 'magnetically' attracted and perhaps if you admit it a little repelled despite your pc correctness saying no you shouldn't be. It has a Lynchian quality to it and offers the promise of a quite wonderful and strange film. The other quality the film has is it's structure - a film within a film. The structure in itself allows for exciting ideas to be developed, and the film makes use of that structure to good if not quite, however, outstanding effect.One other positive, and it has to be said because so much of the film lingers on Amy Adams, is that she is quite simply stunning looking. This may seem like an archaic value judgement, and yet the film does depend upon her attraction to match the slickness of the film. Now this is a problem as well, because Amy Adams isn't really asked to do that much acting, and when the dramatic scenes come you are not quite convinced you care about the fate of her or the other people in the film.The film with in a film does however contain a fine performance from MIchael Shannon; a dying cop investigating the rape and murder of Jake Gyllenhall's characters family. Jake Gyllenall is also the ex-husband of Amy Adams who has sent the film script of this film to her. Therefore the setup is about how much does this film relate to Amy Adams relationship with her ex husband. Amy Adam's character is unhappily married as well, and therefore her ex-husband by way of the script (which by the way is good) reawakens a wish in her to go back to him. There is a critical problem however in that she aborted their child. This is revealed fairly late on in the film and adds a new dimension to the film with in the film.This though is the problem: does the film with in the film convincingly relate to the overall story. I wasn't really convinced because I didn't think there was an explicit enough connection between both sides of the film. The film with in the film to be fair would have made a good enough film on its own. The acting unfortunately is rather uneven throughout both 'films'. Jake Gyllenhall seems too intense for the role, and the film really needed to allow its actors more room for subtlety.This is a complicated and ambtious film and it is very well made, but something is missing from it. It isn't a purely superficial film, because there is depth underlying it. There are characters who are genuinely damaged, but the film ends up being more superficial because it doesn't allow room for the characters to be fully developed. I think the film's main reveal about the abortion comes too late in the film. It might have changed our earlier perceptions of where the film with in film was going and maybe this would have got me more involved with the film within a films meaning.This is a difficult film to review, and you have to see it to really understand, why people have mixed feelings about it. I admired the acheivement, but wasn't emotionally involved in the story. The film isn't a failure, but it is a film that doesn't quite work and it's ending is rather anti-climatic. The film just didn't quite nail it. .",Nocturnal Animals

297,filmsbyq,Nocturnal Animals - a review,8,2 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals tells the story of disillusioned, upper-middle-class, art-gallery owner Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), who is slowly coming to the realisation that her pursing-of-the-Joneses lifestyle, with the slick clothing, show home apartment and Adonis-esque husband (an underused Arnie Hammer), is not at all what she thought would be.Estranged from her husband, who makes a great play of working on a deal, she unexpectedly receives a manuscript from her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man who she left broken in the most unkind of circumstances nearly two decades before. The manuscript is dedicated to her and called - Nocturnal Animals.As she reads the manuscript, she recalls moments in her past with him and moments that directed to her to her present, the book resonates strongly with her, creating feelings of guilt and regret.Tom Ford, he of Gucci revival fame, is the visionary behind this venture. Anyone who knows anything about fashion, especially the high end, ultra sharp, show-me driven looks of the first decade of the new millennium, has witnessed the strong look of Tom Ford. He was always going to bring a strong visual style to cinema and Nocturnal Animals looks spectacular.From the Michael Mann like landscape and cityscape shots to the pin sharp, clinically clean look of the city interiors, even the sun-scorched Texas desert scenes look good. This is a film shot with high resolution screening in mind. The blacks are inky and deep, making navy and even charcoal easily discernible. It is a truly colour rich film.Not that the colour is used blithely. Susan's city, gallery and bedroom scenes contrast easily with the softer remembrance scenes, the manuscript scenes stand out also with a different type of harshness.The visual extravaganza is accompanied by a haunting, emotional soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski. As much as the visuals keep you engaged, the music keeps an air of foreboding about the proceedings, keeping you wondering where the story is going take you.For all his brilliance - and Ford is quite impressive - I felt the weakest, though not weak, part of his film was the script. It is a good script and a thoroughly engaging film, but the parts of the script that one would assume would be easiest for him to write, relate to; the gallery scenes, the party in the home - are the most clunky, almost heavy handed. The best scenes are the story-within-a-story scenes, where we are as engaged as Susan is and just as curious as to the outcome. Because of the nature of the film and story, it is told in a meandering fashion, with present day, memory and fiction all being viewed simultaneously. It is, especially as a second feature, an incredibly brave piece of filmmaking. Tom Ford should be not only proud, he should perhaps not wait another seven years to make his next feature!",Nocturnal Animals
298,MannyInNewYork,A short review based upon 30 minutes of stress,1,20 June 2017,"All the actors are good. That is part of the reason it decided to watch this. Unfortunately, the story line is predictable, so violent and so disturbing that after 30 minutes I had to turn it off. This begs the question - why can't a writer / director make a movie that involves a horrific situation without having to explicitly show what goes on? This was disgusting. And there was no need for it . If you're pandering to the exploitation crowd, then when bother pretending that your product is anything other than what it is?A real disappointment. Crude, depressing and disturbing. And that's just the first thirty minutes. Strive for something better. I got this from the library.

300,Danielpotato,Mediocre Movie,4,10 December 2016,"Yesterday I saw this movie and Arrival, then. First Nocturnal Animals and then Arrival. I stayed in the cinema for 4 hours in a row. I had not done this for years. Arrival had potential. But from the middle of the film, this potential has been spoiled. And it gave rise to a mediocre movie. Nothing special except for the technical part.Nocturnal Animals has no potential. It's a mediocre movie from beginning to the very end. The viewer knows how the film unfolds, how the characters will react (put famous actors, also takes the charm of the film away, because we know how these actors will react, because these actors are pretty well known and this removes in a way the feeling of discovery). There is no potential here to develop the imagination, everything in this film is made in the laboratory with no room for anything else. Except for some scenes of nudity and violence. A supermarket method to cover something too banal. I could mention the symbolic aspect of the movie. But I always find the Symbolists and their way of thinking too limited and a waste of time that does not enrich anything in the film. A useless gimmick that just makes people think in a gratuitous way, What matters, if Amy Adams's character is seated on a red couch, a red couch where the female characters in the book story line are found dead after being raped. It's just useless situations that make you think only in these situations and not in the movie itself. I will not waste any more time on this mediocre movie.",Nocturnal Animals
301,MovieSoup,"Dark bro, very dark",9,7 September 2018,"I really enjoyed this film and loved almost everything. The film has a ""story-within-a-story"" feel which I just loved and the cast were stella, you could really tell that they cared about their performances and put effort and passion into every scene. Jake Gyllenhaal gave an emotional, powerful and convincing performance. In my opinion he was able to capture the vulnerability and frustration of a man who struggles to be the man society wants him to portray. Amy Adams was fantastic and really did portray a woman who has everything she thought she wanted but still feels empty inside. The two of them have great chemistry and I found the flashbacks to their previous life to be very interesting and enjoyable to watch. Especially as their relationship starts to break down because of Edwards sensativity and susans ambition and dissatisfaction, with Edward, grows.The cinematography has a perfect balance between the light and darkness of the situations presented. The contrast between the ""real world"" and the ""story world"", in terms of colour, is very interesting. Everything in Susans world feels fabricated, dark and sleek giving me this feeling of an absence of colour in her life since she left Edward. In contrast the scenes with her and Edward, and the scenes in the ""story world"" are very colourful with a certain grit to them. There are some great supporting characters and Michael Shannon in particular is just a great pleasure to watch. The only problem I have is there are a couple of characters, in particular Carlos and Alissia that seem out of place. There is a scene where they mention that Carlos is a secret gay that really goes nowhere. Its like ""why put that in the movie""??? It serves no purpose to the plot at all???? In fact it confused me, that's why it gets a 9/10 instead of higher from me. Check this one out....or don't. I'm not in charge of your life!",Nocturnal Animals

Gyllenhaal and Shannon made it a bit better than good.The two stories were woven together nicely.Adams did fine at middle-aged angst, but that story was of course boring, because all stories of middle-aged angst are boring. Some kind of actual plot here would have done this movie a world of good.The ending was so weak, I thought the movie makers must have gotten to that point and realized they didn't really have a main story, just a bunch of middle-aged angst. So they decided to get it over with as quickly as possible, always the best thing to do when dealing with middle- aged angst.If the movie had been written by grownups, he would have shown up reeking of happiness, not because that's the best revenge, but because he actually was happy. Their marriage would have been a fond but distant memory, an error of youth, a growth experience that really did make him a better writer, for which he is genuinely grateful, but hardly the big experience of his life. He would have found the love of his life, just didn't happen to marry her. Been there, done that.Then she would have been left with the ridiculousness of ever having imagined that it was all about her.",Nocturnal Animals
303,klheintz,Multiple story lines which blend well to tell a tale of revenge,7,25 November 2016,"Nocturnal Animals is a wonderfully crafted film. The acting is great, the art direction is great, the cinematography is great, and the feeling of tension is great. The multiple story lines are handled very well, with all 3 of them being just different enough to be easily distinguishable from each other but still allow for aspects of one to seamlessly flow to another.The film also misleads a lot with Gyllenhaal playing 2 of the characters in a way that it brings up a lot of questions as to what is exactly going on. I loved that about the film because it creates tension in the unknown and a lot of that is hinged on Adams character and how she is reacting to the novel. Especially with the weird occurrences that constantly pull her out of it.I do feel that a lot of the acting is missing some character. A lot of the people in the main story line feel very one-dimensional but I feel it was purposeful to show the superficial side of the high life. Other than that little nitpick I think all the acting was great with Shannon and Gyllenhaal standing out the most. The novel ""Nocturnal Animals"" in the film is by far the best part and I like how they get it to feel so separate of from the rest of the film but they still drag little bits here and there from Adams life in a way that isn't cheesy or gimmicky.Overall it's a good film that doesn't leave too much up to discussion with the twist but you want to talk about it nonetheless.",Nocturnal Animals

309,Oliveraandreasson,Gyllenhaal is going to have to see a doctor for his back after carrying this movie,6,15 January 2020,"First off, this movie is a mess, but a very well acted one. Jake Gyllenhaal once again shows just how incredible of an actor he is and his performance single handedly made this movie enjoyable. The range of emotion he conveys is astounding and seeing his character go through these feelings is certainly an experience.Amy Adams is normally also a fantastic actor but she does not get to show that in this film due to her character only having two moods in the entire film: Sad and flirty. Michael Shannon is fantastic at what he gets to do in the film and Aaron Taylor-Johnson surprised me with a great performance considering I haven't seen him in much since his kick-ass days.Moreover, the score is fabulous and one of the things I liked most about this film. Another strong element is the cinematography that really helps set the mood, and some shots are very beautiful.
Now onto the negatives:As I said, the story is messy, incoherent and doesn't do a good enough job of connecting the two plots. It's so bad, that they completely feel like two different movies, something which truly bothered me. Following this point, the ending is also a complete wreck that neither ties anything together, nor gives any answer, and it's very unsatisfyinigFurthermore, the movie tries and fails, to be thrilling/scary which is dissapointing as that would take it to completely new heights in my opinion.

I believe is really worth to watch this movie, and everyone has different conclusions. I believe Jake Gyllenhaal performances was amazing, he is a little crazy, then loving, caring, insecure, joyful.

Its so hard to play villain and negative characters when you do not look like a negative person. Usually people are type- cast for these kind of roles but I was just surprised to see how Aaron owned his character. He was not trying too hard to play this character, he just got under the skin of this character. When you see him first time in the film he does not look like he is a bad person. He just seems to be fooling around with this family but as the story progresses, his inner nature is revealed. Good actors need good characters for them to shine. Would love to work with Aaron Taylor Johnson some day. Armie Hammer was not bad either.",Nocturnal Animals
315,j_smith_7,First world problems,4,7 January 2017,"A reasonably well intentioned effort by Tom Ford quickly trips over its own laces as whingey whiny first world problem after first world problem leads the viewer to care not a jot about anyone of the characters in this film; whether they be in the 'real' story or in the parallel 'fictional' one.If I were to find anything praiseworthy about the film at all, it's the presence of Michael Shannon who dominates the screen wherever he appears. Actually, in my opinion, had he been chosen to play the fictional character of Tony, the story would have had more clout instead of watching plastic haired Jake Gyllenhaal pouting and feigning interest in a story he seems not to care much about either.I found the cinematography flat and lifeless and the main purpose of this film appears to be to promote the (purportedly) beautiful interior spaces inhabited by the 'art-irati' and their vanity eyewear. In short, had this film been named 'Nocturnal Interiors', it would have had more of a focus to it.All in all, a poor effort of a film. 4/10",Nocturnal Animals
316,edenney01,"Garbage, don't trust the rating.",5,2 January 2017,"*This review doesn't contain actual spoilers, but you can inference what DOESN'T happen at the end of the movie from this review, and that could be a spoiler in and of itself* After wasting 2 hours watching this, I was so shocked by the (current) 7.8 IMDb rating that I decided to waste another 15 minutes of my life and add up the ratings of the 164 people who had left a review and rating, and compare that to the anonymous ratings left by supposedly real people. I strongly felt, and feel, that the IMDb ballot box for this movie is being stuffed so to speak. Not surprising in an age where companies unabashedly advertise on TV that they will build your website for you and then fill it with good (fake) reviews. The result of my find, was that the average rating for all 164 people who left a review was 6.5, which is a pretty far cry from a 7.8 on IMDb when it comes to movie quality. A movie approaching 8 stars is generally considered a must-see, whereas a movie with 6.5 stars is rather mediocre. That said, I still feel that even the 6.5 rating is skewed, because as a newer movie that won't even hit home video for some time, it's stacked with an initially high percentage of movie critic reviews as opposed to actual moviegoers, and we all know how critics love pointless, artsy fartsy movies by snobbish directors who don't feel like there has to be any point or meaningful conclusion to a movie. As I skimmed through the reviews, it was apparent to me that the 9 and 10 star reviews were largely from critics and art lovers, where as the plethora of 1 and 2 star reviews were from average moviegoers.On that note, IMHO this movie is utter garbage with little to no redeeming qualities, and a complete waste of 2 hours of your life. As someone else aptly titled their review, it's like sex without the orgasm, however that's being far too generous to this movie since at least sex is enjoyable, if not fulfilling, without the orgasm lol. The writing, screenplay, pacing, acting, and especially directing, were among the worst I've ever seen, which is sad because there are a few very good actors in it (and some very bad ones) who have turned in very compelling performances in the past. I honestly don't know what this movie bills itself as. I know what I was expecting beforehand and as I was watching it, and that's a suspenseful, psychological thriller that must be building up to some really great plot twist. But nope, it simply flat lined, literally and figuratively.Separate out the stories within the story, and there's no way in hell a studio would've ever made a movie about either of them. The real life of Amy Adams character was insanely boring, commonplace, and pointless. The story within the manuscript was very drawn out with poor dialogue, poor acting, poor direction, and absolutely no meaningful or redeeming conclusion. It's like some real life writer wrote a short story (which is all the manuscript inside this movie really is), and then desperately tried to stretch that out into a full length movie. Ever seen the ""The Box"" with Cameron Diaz, which was based on a short story? That movie had a kernel of an interesting idea, along with two or three good actors, but those elements aren't enough to make a good, full length movie, and the result was a hot mess. That's exactly what happened here. The real lives of Amy and Jake's characters are completely and totally pointless if they don't in some meaningful way tie in to the story of the manuscript (which they don't), so why even bother with that side of the movie if that story isn't compelling and doesn't even lead anywhere? The answer is simple, because without it, much like ""The Box"", you have maybe 30-40 minutes of an incredibly humdrum screenplay consisting only of the manuscript itself, with an immensely unfulfilling and unimaginative conclusion.Honestly, as it progressed, I was fully expecting this movie to have a sort of ""Jacob's Ladder"" type ending, with the audience discovering that TONY had actually killed Susan and his daughter in real life many years ago, for whatever reason, and that perhaps he was now in prison or an institution etc., creating a sort of fantasy world for himself, imagining that he's finally become a successful writer and that their deaths were just a story in one of his books, in which he ends up avenging them and sacrifices himself in the process, while meanwhile his wife and daughter are alive and well and living out their lives without him. IMHO that certainly could've been spun into a much more compelling ending than this pile of garbage.If you haven't seen ""Jacob's Ladder"", and you want to see a GOOD psychological thriller that actually deserves the 9 and 10 star ratings that so many people inexplicably have given this, rent it on Netflix or whatever now. If you like an intriguing movie that makes you THINK about what's real and what isn't, yet entertains as well as scares you, and also makes you feel like you need to watching it another time or two to really understand it, THAT'S the movie for you. You'd be far better served watching it twice than watching this movie once. Also, for the Jake Gyllenhaal fans out there, watch Zodiac if you haven't already. Again, a suspenseful thriller that is far more deserving of some of the ratings and reviews this movie has gotten.",Nocturnal Animals

319,zianimustafa,Night animals - the novel of revenge,9,19 January 2018,"Revenge .. We all know retaliation .. But what kind of revenge and in what way is retaliation?
That is the main pillar upon which Tom Ford relied on his brilliant masterpieceNocturnal Animals.The film director Tom Ford is essentially a world-famous fashion designer because of his tasteful touch of the famous Gucci brand. Tom Ford is a famous name outside the film world. He has not produced just two films, this one.Do you think a man who drowns in the world of fashion and design and Tom Ford's global brand will be cut off from his important time to write narrative text and story and he is directing it to produce an absurd film?
If you think so, you are definitely wrong. Tom Ford has a terrible imagination that has many ideas and has the ability to implement and embody those ideas by portraying them as a film. This is what we know after the manufacture of the rare dramatic masterpiece in which he added to the original novel of his touch and inspired many of his own world as a fashion designer that mysterious and mysterious aspect of his life to reflect to us who Tom Ford is and how he thinks and how his imagination works.The film opens in an unusual way, displaying a kind of art that depicts the bodies of women in which greasy masses of disgusting disgust appear to be a kind of art that evokes and cares for a class of society saturated with everything and looking for strangeness in minute detail as a kind of Rare Arts. The show is run by Susan and her husband. The scene at first is closer to the description of the picture on which Susan is quite different from the taste of Edward her ex-husband dreamer full of romance, this kind of art shows the difference and difference between them.The film is based on three main axes: the one that moves through the film during the film, the first one is the present, then the picture novel and finally what happened in the past. These three axes mercilessly blend together to harmonize in a parallel way until the end of the film and here is also an added innovation to Tom Ford.The past: talks about a love relationship that arose between Susan and Edward and separated after their marriage because Susan believed that Edward was a weak man and his writing was about himself only, as Edward is a writer. Susan's mother also urged Suzanne not to associate with Edward, and Susan was impressed by a handsome man during her studies and wanted to be associated with him. Then she decided to give up Edward for her own reasons to hope for a more organized life without Edward and she miscarried his son without any convincing reasons with his insistence and attempts to maintain the relationship but the relationship ended between them and separated.Present: The life Susan lives with her husband, who preferred to be associated with him by abandoning Edward. A life where Susan runs her job as a manager of an art company and her husband. On one of these days, Susan received a parcel, a novel called ""Night Animals,"" written by Edward and given to Susan after their separation for nearly twenty years to be the first to read the novel according to Edward's wishes.Novel: Edward wrote a fictional story about him and about Susan talking about being married to her and they have a big daughter. One day, they decide to travel to Texas on a vehicle. During their journey, they are confronted by a vehicle in which three young men arrest him on an isolated road, kidnap his wife and daughter, rape them and kill them while he is unable to do anything to them and then decide to take revenge on his family with the help of a policeman.""Novel of Night Animals""
What did Edward want to write that hideous story that shows his weakness and inability to protect his family from the kidnappers and how she kidnapped Susan and her daughter and were brutally raped and then killed and dumped in the desert while he does not have the ability to protect them.
In the novel, Edward created characters who all have meaning. The three young men describe the thinness, deviousness, and laziness that Susan stole from him.
The character of the cancer-stricken police officer, Michael Shannon, is a character who describes sacrifice and power as a second figure to Edward, who was supposed to outweigh Susan's bad qualities and save their relationship but came late after losing his family.In fact, Edward genius, all he wanted from that novel is to activate Susan's memory indirectly and remind him of his deep love and deep into the depths and touch those feelings buried inside. He wanted to access her fear and manipulate her feelings and emotions. He described the novel as his love for her and the psychological damage he suffered after losing it and how his life became a tragedy, so he tells her how to revenge for her and how to kill himself in the latter because his life has no value without it and because of those shocks suffered.
Edward did not want to hurt Susan in a conventional way but revenge in his own way without hurting her physically but psychologically as she did in the past.
He does not hate her but he takes revenge on those bad qualities inside Suzanne. And also to tell her that he is a real artist who does not write about himself only as Susan told him previously and was affected by this, but this time write about Susan with him.He wrote everything so accurately that he took Suzanne's interest in her private life to think about the novel all the time and she was confused by the reality she lived in. She contacted her daughter to reassure her and was confined inside her room to complete the reading of the novel and began to remember her relationship and her moments with him. Recently betrayed ..
At the end of the novel, when Edward killed himself and was injured by his family's retaliation, Suzanne's heartbeat began to accelerate and I felt everything in his novel. I felt sad and her feelings moved again, awakened by details.
I came out of the bath in a scene that came immediately after the end of the novel as if he had breathed his love again and called his name involuntarily

320,cristiandeiana,A decent movie within an unnecessary movie,3,24 December 2016,"I think the story within a story aspect of this movie gave it some very interesting depth, but I feel like the end result was quite unsatisfying. On the surface the movie can be understood as a revenge story, and the story being told from the book was actually quite good. What I don't understand is the need for the alternate 'main' story which everything is being contained within. By the end you can see that the main message of this movie is that of paying for the mistakes you make in life, and that's as close as the two stories come together. The ending of the 'main' story came across very weak, and what the movie really needed is some sort of plot twist to bring it all together. Unfortunately I feel as though both stories feel a bit too disconnected and the result is the feeling as though you've just watched 2 separate movies with one of them being completely unnecessary.It's a shame because it feels like the movie had a lot of potential but just fell flat in the end. But what I think really ended this movie so badly is the underlying message it's trying to convey, the conclusion is that a guy has gotten in contact with his ex to rub his success in her face as a sort of revenge because she supposedly made a mistake in leaving him, and we end with her drinking and looking really sad about it. I just feel like this kind of message isn't very satisfying and actually comes across quite petty if anything. Really if the movie had a better message to get across, or ended in a better way, it could have been pretty good.",Nocturnal Animals

322,gingerrdriley,Tom Ford's pretty good,9,30 November 2016,"Nocturnal Animals is fantastic. The music, cinematography, and especially editing give the film a sort of dream like quality which is not only appropriate for the particular mode of story telling that Ford is using, but greatly compliments the unique, though easy to understand, style of presenting the story. Without spoiling the film, I would like to heap as much praise as possible on the fashion in which Tom Ford decides to tell the bulk of the story. The sort of story within a story that he creates, using the source material from Austin Wright, provides insight into the perspectives and mindsets of the characters that I don't think would have come across as well if the film had a more traditional narrative. In many ways the film follows conventional narrative devices, and that's sort of the point. The devil's in the details, and there are certain aspects of the story within the story which reveals not only what happens to the characters, but the specific meaning that certain events had to them and how they came to perceive their own experience. Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon are all spectacular. Jake Gyllenhaal in particular makes excellent use of his time on screen to distinguish the differences in the varying narratives through his performance.The only gripe I have with the film is during one scene wherein the presentation of the story breaks the sort of consistent pattern it sets without really being justified. I don't really mean that there was a subversion of expectation which creates a new direction in the story which I didn't expect, that wouldn't really be a problem in and of itself. I mean to say that there was a brief moment in one scene which was jarring in its inconsistency with the rest of the story, and which made me think that the sort of effect that it achieved could have been accomplished in a way which was more organic to the nature of the story (without giving away anything specific, I'm referring to a specific jump scare). Nocturnal Animals says a lot about story telling, and how the fashion in which a story is told not only reveals things to the audience about the human experience, but their own experience and the experience of the author, and how those experiences shape our perception of the past.",Nocturnal Animals
323,vinylvanilla,Horribly overrated!,2,22 December 2016,"What can I say about this movie? I think it's overrated, over-hyped, and overpraised. I believe media loves this movie because they're actually praising Tom Ford the stylist, not Tom Ford the filmmaker. The movie undeniably has good qualities - beautiful cinematography, lavish costume design, amazing cast (Michael Shannon's performance is flawless and deserves an Academy Award).However, the screen script is weak, pretentious and childish. The book written by Tony Hastin looks more interesting than the movie itself. I don't understand the need to tell a story inside a story when the main story line is weak, full of clichés and unconvincing. The love story between Susan and Edward didn't convince me at all. It all seemed very poorly developed, the flashback moments were cold, they always seemed like two teenagers speaking - no substance, no deepness, nothing that Tom Ford's target audience would expect, I believe. Edward's little plot of revenge is absurdly childish, also laughable. That's why the character is not convincing to me. It's all absurdly immature. Honestly, I believe Tom Ford was more worried about making a visually impacting movie than actually a good one. He has yet a lot to learn about what is necessary to be a good filmmaker.",Nocturnal Animals

He's left her to a future of regret, bad choices and unfulfilled possibilities. If only she'd kept the faith, believed. Not aborted his child. Had an affair. Yet, he owes her his success, so in a way he's thanking her, but bringing down upon her terrible retribution. The stark contrasts of colours, noise and silence seems overly obvious at times, even unnecessary, the game was kind of given away with the painting, the black and white REVENGE, a little more of a subtle message or none at all would have left the mind thinking for that bit longer, that little deeper.

I don't think the writer realized it was a movie not an abstract painting. Movies have purposes, movies have a beginning, a middle, and an end; movies that build to something usually lead somewhere but this pile of junk leads nowhere! Frustratingly nowhere! Hence the title of my review. It builds and builds and has no release it just ends abruptly if you want to call it an ending. so our leading lady is a cliché. She's a career woman married to a career man whose having an affair which is not shocking at all. She was married once before and her ex-husband,a novelist, sends her his book. Most of the movie is about the guy in the story whose wife and daughter are kidnapped and raped. He works for over a year with a detective to catch the murderers. Now why the entire movie was not that story instead is beyond me. I could give a crap less about how she left her novelist husband after aborting his child just to end up with a cheating husband. Who cares about that storyline since it had no point! That storyline ends with her being stood up in a restaurant drinking scotch. The end. Really? I also found out Tom Ford designs clothes. He should probably stick with that. And the beginning of this movie with fat naked women dancing in slow motion was supposed to be some crap statement when really it was just uncomfortable to watch and stupid. About as pointless as the film itself. The film creator is the man and the audience the woman in my mind. Having said that the ""man"" is pleased. They made money, managed to get brilliant actors to do their crap film, and live happily ever after in their mansions. I the ""woman"" or audience if you will am left unsatisfied and $9 shorter but hey glad i could contribute to their yachts. And for those who like this junk and think I'm too dumb to grasp metaphors if thats what this movie thinks it is, one big metaphor for something, I urge you to see a film called Silent House. That is a film full of metaphors and statements that work with a storyline that builds to an actual finale. This is the worst film of the year and I'm saying that in a year when the remake of Ghostbusters came out with a frigging female cast (ohh guess that makes me sexist) as well as the release of the ever so pointless sequel to Independence day. But this film? Absolutely terrible. Rubbish as the Brits say. I wouldn't Netflix it. I wouldn't Redbox it.

 I know, I know ... you say ""disappointing"", but you rate it 7 stars? Well, that is simply because of some of the acting. Gyllenhaul, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson are great, and Adams is ""okay"" as the ""I don't want to grow up to be my Mom, but ... oh, hell ... I did!"" character. 
 This movie had a real story to tell, but, it ended up just being an hour of failed relationships, with 15 minutes of brutality thrown in. And, don't get me started on that ending! When everyone had a chance to ""show"" how they had ""grown up"" over the years ... they all show they were just their same pitiful selves (tho, in Gyllenhaul's defense, life HAD pretty much screwed him over)!
 This movie is fine, if you (like me) are an insomniac, looking to kill an hour and a half at 2:00 a.m.! But, otherwise, find some other ""will they catch the bad guys"" movie, or even an Adam Sandler comedy to kill the time. It will be time better spent.",Nocturnal Animals

333,zadok-332-444684,Sophisticated bluntness does have a point here,6,28 December 2016,"This film starts with strong images and picks up a number of deep topics. Although most of those are not followed and remain little more than a reference, ""to art in general"" and the like, it does so in a sensitive way. Quickly emotion, characters and mystery kick in. An actual plot is first hinted at, then developed. Different layers intertwine and give the film a different direction, turning towards metaphor. The well established grim and sober tone is contrasted by its disruptions, its layers giving relieve to one another. Unfortunately that ends up draining suspense.Ultimately the intricate designs collapse to form a straight forward, even blunt message. Personally I'd say it adds a truly valuable piece to a modern puzzle of social roles and order. That value can be said to redeem the disappointment I felt upon complexities' collapse. Alas it remains questionable to make a film so overly pointed, to make it all about sending a plain message. Even if it is a good one: it costs. Therefor this good film only gets a 6/10 from me.

342,justchillz,Fell asleep after an hour and EXTREMELY misogynistic,1,11 February 2017,"The psycho that directed this film needs to see a therapist to deal with his issues towards women. People said 50 shades of grey was bad, it was nothing in comparison. Whether obese, tween or thin, all women were objectified and nude in this movie. It begins with like 10 minutes of an obese naked woman dancing. IT was like watching a Dove commercial that did not want to end. Totally pointless. The director just wanted to emphasize the kind of body that is unacceptable (considered disgusting) in society. We got the message after about one minute! How about showing some anorexics as well? Or, how about showing some obese men?You already know a male directed the film, and clearly one that has some serious issues towards obese women. Any overweight woman watching the beginning of the film would be disgusted with herself. It was just plain cruel. (I am petite and skinny, as a side note, but I was still grossed out.) My interpretation of the director of this film and writer of this book is that he sees women as a binary: 1) attractive and self-absorbed and 2) obese. Women are nothing but mere objects to him and he is strongly prejudiced against women.He makes it seem as though women do not want guys that are highly sensitive, but they like jerks who cheat on them. There is nothing intelligent about this movie or that simple assumption. You do not see guys wanting to date women who make them feel demasculinized because the female is more masculine. In fact, a lot of men I know have dumped women simply because their girl friend was making more money at work. In the end, she made the right choice dumping the guy because he was not a real man, he could not protect her or her daughter from being raped and murdered. He acted like a girl would be expected to act. He only protected himself. He was utterly useless! Men suck and it is best to stay single is the message I got from the movie.Lastly, if you cannot fall asleep, this movie is the perfect sedative. It was so boring. I have never fallen asleep during a movie, but this movie was all over the place. The most boring parts you have to sit through to hear about the interesting parts that are not even part of the movie, but part of a book. I do not understand the high reviews for this film. If you write a paper or a novel that is all over the place like this movie, it would receive a big REJECT. Peer-reviewers would destroy your written work for the lack of a consistent story line. If this were written for a course, you would receive a failing grade on it and be encouraged to take writing classes. Yet in this film, there is no real beginning or end, it is all over the place and drags at times, has no consistent story line, and this disastrous mess gets a pass? What I learned from watching the film. If you are a HORRIBLE writer, make films for a living instead and call it art.",Nocturnal Animals
343,Reznik_T,Great film,8,23 August 2017,"Nocturnal Animals introduces three stories: one is present day reality, the second one is a flashback of past memories, and the third one is a fictional story written by one of the main characters. These three stories are excellently woven together, and together they add up to a movie that, I think, is one of the best ones of 2016. The fictional storyline rises above the rest of the movie, especially because of two magnetic performances by Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The dialogue and the acting in this particular part of the movie is really-really good (better than in the other two story lines), it got me totally invested in the characters and the story. The cinematography and the editing throughout the whole film is outstanding. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will only say: If you like a good thriller/drama that will also make you think about things such as life, regrets, relationships, you will probably like it.",Nocturnal Animals

The ""story within a story"" was good, a harsh look at human behavior (moreso for the antagonist than for Gyllenhall's ""weak"" character, hard to imagine anyone so complacent). Distracting bits include Adams' awful makeup, the random horror sequences, and out of place soundtrack. The movie ended with a whimper... I literally said ""That's it?"" and looked for a post-credit scene. Another case of the trailer completely misleading the viewer about the content and tone of the film. Some stunning visuals in the desert, but overall left me thinking ""meh"".",Nocturnal Animals
347,melgarcia40,An analysis of personal expression and self-actualization,8,12 January 2017,"When the movie ended, I knew that it would gather polarizing reactions, and that people would hate it just as much as I loved it, and, in a way, this is a perfect reflection of what I felt was the message of this movie. Some will see the story of a petty revenge, some will see the analysis of weakness, and what I saw in it was the depiction of what art and creation is about. Edward's novel, as we pick up along the clues left by ford in the movie, is the metaphorical expression of how he felt when she left him and aborted his child. For him, what she did equated to the rapt, rape and murder. Harrowing, heartbreaking, devastating, this is how he felt. But beyond Edward's words, there is Susan's interpretation of it. She is the one who pictures Tony (the ""weak"" one) with Edward's face, but in the end, isn't Susan the weak one? The one who didn't fight for the relationship and let it die (to conform to her mother's expectations?) What I loved about Nocturnal animals is that you can think about any of the novel's character and see who or what Edward was metaphorically expressing through them, like Bobby Andes, the relentless sheriff with cancer and nothing to lose, Ray, the epitome of vileness and disgust, his acolytes... Nothing is left and said in this movie for fluff, everything exists for a reason. Tom Ford manipulates with brio the 3 timelines and goes back and forth effortlessly, never losing the viewer, and adds to it a fantastic cinematography. The movie cast is one of the major assets of the movie, with an understated but efficient Amy Adams and an emotionally heartbreaking Jake Gyllehaal. But if the 2 leads are good, the supporting cast is even better: Michael Shannon is scene stealing, and Aaron Taylor- Johnson blew me away with a performance I thought he didn't have in him. However, and just as with Edward's book, this movie will not touch everyone the same way. I can see why some will love it and some hate it, but for me it was a hit.",Nocturnal Animals
348,HollywoodGlee,"Nocturnal Animals is a tale of redemption, revenge, love and cruelty.",10,26 September 2016,"Fashion Designer and Film Director Tom Ford premiered his new film, Nocturnal Animals, at the Sala Grande Theater during the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. Nocturnal Animals received this year's Silver Lion – Grand Jury Prize (generally considered runner-up to the Golden Lion – Best Film). This was Ford's second feature film. His first film was the critically acclaimed, A Single Man (2009) starring Colin Firth. Firth receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his efforts.Nocturnal Animals is a tale of redemption, revenge, love and cruelty. Ford opens the film with a strong musical score to reveal rotund, morbidly obese girls dancing topless upon pedestals seemingly pretending to be debutantes. Adding to the fanfare special effect confetti drops down and through the frame. All-American girls showcasing their goods and talents. Bordering on the macabre, the tone for the film has been set.Hollywood A-lister Amy Adams plays a real-life West Texas debutante, Susan Morrow, who lives an unfulfilling life of daunting privilege with her handsome husband, Hutton Morrow, played by Armie Hammer. As Hutton prepares for yet another last-minute weekend high-finance business meeting in New York relationship fissures widen. A pensive Susan reflects on the state of her union with Hutton after a 'not-so-discreet' phone conversation from Hutton's elevator as he is arriving at a penthouse suite amid feminine gaiety as she opens a plain, white, mail shipping box. Susan opens the box to a black and white manuscript titled, ""Nocturnal Animals,"" by Edward Sheffield, Susan's former husband and first true love.In dramatic fashion, Ford begins a journey into the past yet grounded in the present as the manuscript opens up a world fictional, yet etched within Susan's consciousness. Using parallel story lines, present and fictional coupled with flashbacks to when Edward and Susan first met and the ensuing courtship and short-lived marriage. Laura Linney, plays Susan's West Texas Republican mother, and delivers some of the film's more memorable lines during a martini lunch where she unleashes lambasting Susan for even considering a marriage to ""weak' Edward. Notwithstanding, however, the real storytelling takes place within the pages of the manuscript. Self-reflective and dramatic the narrative is full of conflict and escalating tensions as a husband and wife, Tony and Laura Hastings, played respectively by Jake Gyllenhaal and Isla Fisher, travel at night across rural West Texas with their teenage daughter, India, played by Ellie Bamber. Without even as much as a lit billboard, out of a pitch dark blackness a vehicle approaches the family's suburban mid-sized car at a high-rate of speed. The car is driven erratically and its occupants are behaving wildly as they pass. Not too much to worry about until they decide to force the Hastings car off the road. Mayhem ensues as the hellions carjack the Hastings vehicle with the women inside leaving Tony on the side of the road in the dark by his lonesome. Soon a vehicle returns to pick up Tony. He's informed he gang leader wants to make amends and that Laura and India want Tony brought to where they are being held hostage. Fearing the worst Tony manages to escape and eventually makes his way to a law enforcement office to make an abduction/missing persons report to lawman Bobby Andes, played by Michael Shannon. Susan is shocked and awed at the power of Edward's writing and the visceral strength of Edward's character, Tony. By the end of the manuscript, Susan's life perspective has shifted as she and Edward make plans to meet.Unquestionably, Ford delivers an emotional and psychological thriller with Nocturnal Animals. Superb acting, exquisite production values and strong storytelling are the film's hallmarks. Shane Valentino (Straight Outta Compton) handled the film's production design. Seamus McGarvey (Godzilla, Atonement, The Avengers) provided the cinematography. Costuming was assembled by Arianne Phillips (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Walk The Line, 3:10 To Yuma). Abel Korzeniowski (A Single Man, We) orchestrated the music. Along with directing Ford takes a screenplay writing credit along with Austin Wright, the author of ""Tony and Susan,"" for writing the novel the film is based on. Nevertheless, the Casting Director, Francine Maisler (The Revenant, Birdman, The Big Short, 12 Years a Slave) and performances by the actors are above and beyond. This is a Don't Miss film waiting for Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences nominations - The Oscars.",Nocturnal Animals

The scene in the art gallery with an art piece saying REVENGE and the use of white on white continues the aura of mystery and suspense.Essentially, this is a story of romance and violence with a lot of twists and turns thrown in.This is Tom Ford's second movie after a gap of 7 years and bears all the hallmarks of his first - beautifully filmed, great plot and superb story line which holds the viewer from start to finish.Watch it and watch it again.",Nocturnal Animals

The characters fail to elicit any sympathy, particularly the central character played by Amy Adams. The camera adores Adams with its languorous shots of her, but her cold character, and Adams lack of emotional range as an actor leaves the viewer cold and unsympathetic.Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow, a wealthy art gallery owner whose ex-husband, Edward, a writer, played by Jake Gyllenhall, sends her a draft of his new novel. The plot of the novel plays out in parallel with Susan's present while reading the novel and past scenes from her relationship with Edward.The story within a story, the novel, is diverting in its early stages and grips the viewer. Early scenes in it, with Gyllenhall also playing the role of the novels protagonist Tony, as he and his family come across a group of violent thugs, are powerful. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as Ray Marcus, the gang leader is particularly terrifying.But the film slows after that as Michael Shannon's cop gets involved in helping Tony while Susan's story struggles to find a decent conclusion. The film is left without any real substance beyond the first half-hour and peters out.The film has strong performances by Taylor-Johnson and the ever reliable Shannon. But Adams and Gyllenhall are too weak in the central roles to carry the film. While a whole series of strong actors including Andrea Riseborough, Michael Sheen and Laura Linney are wasted in throwaway roles.Apart from its cold beauty and the performances of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon there is nothing to recommend this film which is a major disappointment after director Tom Fords excellent debut film A Single Man.",Nocturnal Animals

The perfect balance of style and substance, I was immediately captivated by the stunning cinematography, alluring sets, and lush costume design but once the story-within-a-story began to unfold I realized there was much more to this film than the eye candy. I don't remember the last time I was so thoroughly entertained by a new film. The casting was perfect and every actor is at the top of their game here, no performance feels even remotely phoned-in. Amy Adams shines as the haunted lead, Susan; meanwhile, Gyllenhaal gives one of the finest and most memorable performances of his career (right up there with Brokeback Mountain and Nightcrawler) as Susan's former husband Edward, and as Susan's mental image of the fictional character Tony, the protagonist from Edward's novel. But perhaps the best, and most unnerving, of all is Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the degenerate villain, Ray. There's a lot to love about this film, but the sharp contrast between Susan's empty, decadent life in the post-post-modern world of high art in LA and the ugly, rugged desert thriller of Edward's novel is one of my favorite features.

But the main reason I watched the movie was because Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jake Gyllenhaal are some of my favourite actors.As much as I know how fictional the acting is, this is defiantly one of the most messed up movies I've ever seen, so messed up I can probably never watch it again -- similar to beautifully disturbing movies such as 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'American History X.' But at the same time lots of effort and time was put into the movie to the point it was so well done along with the amazing acting. But if you are going to watch it, you might want to skip some of the scenes in the beginning.The reason I have it rated so low is because it triggered my PTSD considering I've lived through some relatively similar events within this movie and have known many psychopaths in my lifetime -- even if I was an actor, I can honestly play one in a movie perfectly that I've been around them so much and can tell who is or isn't one.

The rest of the cast comes across equally arrested, all except Isla Fisher and Michael Shannon whose acting almost saves their lame lame lines. Although to be fair, there is some evidence of an attempt to make Shannon's lines a bit more Texan lone-wolf copper like, even jocular--and the fact I've just used the word ""jocular"" illustrates just how well that went.I'm sure there will be plenty of people out there who will simply adore this darling film, but for those of us who have moved on from the picture books (except of course for a graphic novel or two), and the only thing that makes us get through the day is a great meaty story fearlessly told, Nocturnal Anymals ain't it.",Nocturnal Animals

The story within the story dominates, which undercuts the kinder, gentler revenge of the elites. And the story inside is your typical cartoonish take on the ""lower classes"", here it being West Texas psychotic ruffians. Ford decides to forego any gruesome renditions of the extreme violence; that is left to ominously delivered dialogue by Sheen's rogue cop. What you're left with is workman-like filmmaking (more suited to your lower budget cable TV networks) with some big stars in it with not much more to do than deliver less than stellar dialogue and swim around in underdeveloped characters.

373,dougiesantarosa,A Decent Film,7,19 August 2017,"Amy Adams, art gallery owner, receives a proof of manuscript of her ex-husband Edward and an invitation for dinner during Edward's upcoming visit to Los Angeles. Amy is in a deteriorating second marriage to an unfaithful, so she becomes consumed by Edward's novel that is dedicated to her. The film switches to a teleplay of Edward's novel. Tony, a peaceful man, during a road trip through West Texas with his wife and daughter, accidentally rearends three rural redneck 20-somethings – and the self involved brat daughter stupidly flips the bird at them – the dirtbags force Tony, his wife and daughter in their late model Mercedes off the road, flattens their tire, beats Tony molests his wife and daughter. Then kidnaps his wife and daughter and leaves him with Lou, one of the young rednecks. He makes Lou drive the rednecks car to the end of a dirt road where he gets away. Tony manages to evade them goes to a dingy farmhouse and calls the police. With a detective, Tony, discovers the bodies of his mutilated, dead wife and daughter in the wilderness, raped and murdered. Tony is beyond pain feeling guilty for not protecting them. A year later he's asked to identify one of the rednecks, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders. The other one was fatally shot in a botched robbery, and the last one is brought to justice, but ultimately released due to circumstantial evidence. Faced with terminal lung cancer, the detective, with Tony's help, takes matters into his own hands and abducts the dirtbags and shoots one of them, but the other one gets away. Then Tony tracks him down on his own to the shack where his wife and daughter were killed and the dirtbag admits to raping and murdering Tony's wife and daughter, calling him weak. So he shoots and kills him, but is blinded when the dirtbag hits him on the head with an iron bar. Tony stumbles outside, succumbing to to a brain hemorrhage, and dies after falling on his gun, shooting himself in the stomach.Now back in the real world, Amy Adams is so shocked by the raw emotion of her ex husband's new novel, reminisces about meeting him in college and falling for him, but (done better by Ryan Godling and Rachel McAdams in 2004 The Notebook) Amy's domineering mother objects to him, claiming that he's unworthy of Amy's affections and that he's too romantic and worldly, lacking the drive to actually achieve his goals She ignores her mother and ultimately marries Edward.Of course, She has a troubled marriage with Edward, who cannot handle her frustration with his fledgling career and her dismissive attitude towards his literary aspirations, and so she cheats on him with another man ultimately divorcing Edward to marry the man. Edward attempts to repair their relationship, but ultimately cuts the cord with Amy when he learns she's pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion to ensure the divorce would proceed. So, after reading Edward's new novel she arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant, but Edward doesn't show up, as he stand's her up for revenge. So she realizes he's a good writer after all and she's stuck in a sham and unhappy with her life. Michael Shannon (pre General Zod in Man of Steel) is incredible as a terminally ill Texas detective. And Prince of Persia Jake Gyllenhaal is way better than anything I've seen him in lately - thank Jesus he shaved off the gross facial hair for the flashbacks. And Amy Adams plays typical lovelorn damsel as always. But I realize Tom Ford lives in this luxurious world of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, with beautiful faces and bodies. But its no excuse to occasionally throw in pointless gratuitous nudity - Jake in steamy shower scenes and Aaron Taylor Johnson outside on a toilet. I'll still be grateful for Tom Ford's A Single Man.

375,LTSmash14,A Great Film Dipped in Art House Bullshit,6,12 September 2016,"Nocturnal animals is three stories woven into one. It's a story about a woman (Amy Adams) living in her upper class LA life with problems in her boring marriage to her gorgeous, rich, husband. She mysteriously receives a manuscript from her ex husband, to whom she hasn't spoken to in 19 years. The manuscript is a terrifying story of a man who's family is attacked on the highway. This story is overlayed with Adam's present, and her past, falling in love with her first husband, Eddie, the author of the manuscript. The tale of the family man on the highway is an excellent story of a man's descent, in the style of great films like Prisoners. The rest feels like an empty attempt to create an art house dichotomy between Adam's character and the man in the novel, with less than subtle ""hints"" like a red velvet couch appearing in the three stories at a shallow attempt to mirror the feeling in each story. It completely falls flat and serves as a distraction from a good story to focus on an underdeveloped story of a woman in a bad marriage out of love with her career, that we've seen a hundred times. It felt like a narcissistic attempt to be ""deep"" by mirroring objects at three different points in time and space. The visuals are beautiful and the focus on colour does not go unnoticed. Each actor acted for their lives, and there is certainly some credit due to Tom Ford for seeming to get the best performance out of this brilliant ensemble cast.",Nocturnal Animals

My husband and I watched this movie the other night and some of the scenes were tough to watch emotionally. That night we gave this a chance, the movie ended and I looked and him and started complaining. I hated it. I didn't get it... I had so many questions.The next day I found myself thinking about it more and it sparked conversations between us and we found ourselves bringing the movie up for days.

What do I want to be? How do I deal with people and the world?I'm also confused, because the movie ends with Susan just as confused as she was at the beginning. All the characters in this movie are precarious and kept off balance, which put me as a viewer on the edge wondering what comes next, but also made me uncomfortable.The two main casts, Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams, are superb. The plot is also interesting, with two storylines (the real world and the book) proceeding in parallel. Susan's emotions move back and forth painfully between these two arcs. You won't waste your two hours with this movie if you are a thriller fan.I still have a hard time figuring out what the point of this movie is, apart from reminding me of how difficult life is if you do not know your place in the world. Wait, what is the point of life after all?By the way, IMDb rating statistics suggest an interesting point: younger viewers rate this movie higher than older ones do.

378,mannacio,Doesn't Make its point,6,24 November 2016,"Another over rated movie given a score of 8.0 by IMDb viewers. I won't recount, again, the famous movies in the top 100 that barely achieved this score but will provide some context. The beginning of the movie is unnecessary to the plot and if it doesn't gross you out you have very thick skin. You may reply that this display shows the way in which Susan has been corrupted to accept sensationalism as art. Perhaps. It still seems gratuitous and the movie is also, in some sense. The acting is good. The set design is good. The cinematography is good. The plot doesn't quite make it.The concept is that Susan is asked to read a book her ex-husband has written. But, it becomes apparent that the book is a weapon used to abuse her. A form of revenge. Of course, it is not all that unusual for an ex to want to take revenge. But using fiction to do it is.Now, despite the acting, you may not be too sympathetic to Susan. She lives in a world in LA that is very superficial. But, when you see the mental violence her ex inflicts on her he doesn't seem all that sympathetic either. This is where the movie falls apart. Even in a tragedy, of the form ""man against himself"", the author needs to create some sympathy and identification with the protagonist. But the protagonist is an abuser who is immersed in revenge by novel and cannot get our sympathy. Susan may be worthy of some sympathy but this does not carry the movie.An unfinished idea that was somewhat disappointing.",Nocturnal Animals

381,RedrumNeddy,A Masterpiece,10,10 December 2020,"Nocturnal Animals is an almost perfect example of a psychological thriller done right. This is one of those movies that pulls at your heartstrings and it doesnt let them go. It has guts and emotion, and explores very sensitive and serious themes like love, revenge and regret. When I found out that Tom Ford directed this movie, I was even more amazed. This guy is a fashion designer and he really put many lifelong directors to shame with this movie, atleast in the way I see it. The intensity and tension in this movie is hard to match, I felt genuine dread and I was constantly on the edge of my seat. Jake Gyllenhaal, to nobodies surprise, delivers yet again. His display of grief and rage is pretty much unparalelled among his peers. Amy Adams is stunning in every meaning of the word and does an absolutely fantastic job in her role of Susan Morrow. I would also point out Michael Shannons very raw approach to portraying a police officer, and I always love to see more of him. I felt a very unusual connection with the character of Edward/Tony which is hard to describe. Without getting into any spoilers, I guess you can say we have similar character traits.A fair warning that some scenes are downright sickening, so if you are sensitive, you should watch out.Great pacing and structure, a wonderful cast and a very nice ending to boot.

382,mdhugs,Revenge Revenge,6,9 May 2017,"The opening credits. Sweet Lord. I promise I will never objectify women again if only I get the images of the dancing grotesques out of my memory. I fought the temptation to pluck out my eyes and persevered with this tale of revenge. We know it is about revenge because a) it is obvious and b) A 10' art installation called REVENGE is shoe-horned into a scene (incidentally featuring a character who must have been inspired by Bubble from Ab-Fab). The plot: Adams receives a manuscript from her ex (Gyllenhaal) that features a man (Gyllenhaal) who has his family ripped from him (why this strikes a chord with Amy becomes apparent later) and how he subsequently tracks down the perpetrators with the aid of a coughing lawman. This story within the story is far better scripted and acted than the parent story but Gyllenhaal excels as a weak man tormented by the past in both. The supporting cast in the sub-plot are also far superior, Fisher, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson in particular out act the plank-like Hammer and decidedly sub par Sheen in the parent story. And then there's Amy... It's about time the Academy introduced a new award for best tear ducts. Unfortunately our Amy has opted for the full paralysis Botox which makes it impossible for the viewer to determine what emotion she is exhibiting if it weren't for her tear ducts. In this movie tears means upset, no tears means not upset - yes the full gamut. Seriously it is a proved fact that those who cannot physically display emotion have less empathy than those that do. Compare the static, icy Adams portrayal of a woman in a disintegrating marriage who is supposedly seriously disturbed by the revenge motif-ed manuscript to that of Gyllenhaal's puny husband in full gargoyle- gurn mode. Finally we get to the final scene where the best the viewer can manage is an 'oh, is that it?'. Despite its flaws this is worth a watch, if only for the West Texan scenery.",Nocturnal Animals

It really has a way of putting you in a mood and refusing to let go.From the onset of the movie, we see an unhappy Susan in her unhappy life with her handsome husband in a luxurious and over-the-top home. These material goods bring her no joy and we can see that her life is in shambles.As the movie progresses, we start to see why. I don't want to spoil this one. It's best to go in blind and let the movie do what it does best. With one of the most tense scenes I've seen in years, Ford and Editor Joan Sobel pull off a masterpiece with dual storytelling aspects that had me deeply invested in both storylines up until the very end of the film.Give this one a watch but prepare to really have your mind open up into some places I never knew it could go.",Nocturnal Animals

The ""story"" within the story is an unbelievably trite ""plot"" of the type usually seen in cheap ""C"" movies, having been rejected by all the ""B"" movie makers.

He gives a stunning performance as a taciturn western police. His features, reactions, and casualness mixed with the conscientiousness in the job is brilliantly natural.Some reviewers questioned the blurry connection between the book and the protagonists' lives - I say it wouldn't be necessity. That's how a writer is, he writes whatever he feels, and sometimes the story can develop far from his(her) own life.Some reviewers said the movie tries hard to deliver a strong message in the end - a culmination point. Perhaps they have a point. But I say the movie becomes average and boring in the end.

Great movie where the plot is a lot greater than it looks. This story is about Susan, an art gallery owner that is married and has a good life, but not everything is what it seems. Susan receives the draft of a book written by Edward, her ex-husband.
To begin with, the story has a structure in three lines, the present, the flashbacks where Susan remembers her life with Edward and the story itself written in the book. Absolutely interesting way to tell a story, definitely is the viewer's job to put everything together, build the story and discover the causes of actual consequences.
The characters are all a great work and are well established for the story. As a character, Susan is interpreted by Amy Adams whose beauty was taken advantage of through the film. Amy's acting skills were excellent, portraying a woman with emptiness in the look, that is lacking of something and help us to develop the character. Jake Gyllenhaal is Edward in real life and Tony in the book; for Tony's character he's a husband and father that discovers the deepest thoughts about life and revenge after living the loss of his family; and Edward, a magnificent character with whom we empathize even when we don't know a lot about him. Michael Shannon represents Bobby, the sheriff that took Tony's case in the book. And finally, we have Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ray, that animal that took everything from Tony in the book. They all build the story and themselves as the movie moves on, they are developed as original minds and personalities.
Everything about the book is related to some stages Edward passed through when he was with Susan, ending in a beautiful death of our main character, understanding this as the reborn of Edward. This is why the development of the movie is so interesting, discovering the way Edward is describing his life through Tony, and living how Susan suffers for that, how she realizes what she could have done better and how she is now something that she didn't want to be.
The film's photography is detailed and well illuminated, every scene looks framed and with real colors, something really inspiring. The music is kind of classic and brings an essence of calm and chaos at the same time.
In the final scene and through the conclusion of the movie we realize how unhappy Susan is, in my case, that Edward is not going to assist to their dinner and that the heartbreak that Susan caused on him inspired the book that she's actually reading (inspired in many, many ways).",Nocturnal Animals

411,jah9000,Incredible Narrative Presented with Brilliance,10,28 April 2018,"I wouldn't say that it was entirely necessary to BE an artist or a writer to fully appreciate this film, but I can say it doesn't hurt. That's especially true when it comes to smaller details, such as the significance of art works shown on screen and how they tie in to the overall story. I'm both a visual artist and a writer, so my review could fairly be considered biased to a certain degree. On the less ethereal side of things, all one fundamentally needs is one good and nasty romantic heartbreak to ""get it"" at least the meat of it.This is a provocative piece that tweaks and twists emotions as severely as it does visual sensibilities, but not gratuitously. It begins working you over immediately, in the opening sequence depicting an art exhibition and doesn't let go, even after its quite illustrative ending.The production is visually stunning, with strikingly opposed moods, tones and textures. A wide range of sensory manipulation is performed through these changes, in addition to their being used as cues to shifts in the screenplay.Some might say this is a story within a story, but it's actually more complicated AND more simple. I mention this mainly to correct the faulty description in the blurb on IMDB, and I don't believe this is a spoiler. The blurb suggests the main character reads a novel and believes it to be a veiled threat. But that is not at all what happens. The story follows a woman who has received a copy of a manuscript written by her ex-husband. The audience then ""reads"" the novel along with her. As she reads the novel, she begins to understand a number of truths about her life. There are three ""main veins"" through which the story is told (four, if you count the artwork), but it's all one story. Again - I don't think that spoils anything. I mention this as an aid to appreciating the film.It's one of the most impressive films I've seen in quite a while. Highly recommended.",Nocturnal Animals
412,jimojimo,A big middle finger to the audience,3,17 December 2016,"This movie was almost good. Then it ended.I sat through the first 20 min, thinking what a snoozer this was. Then a story started to unfold. The main character, a well to do lady who owns an art gallery gets a manuscript in the mail from her ex husband. She begins to read it, and the story she's reading is played out in the movie. The story is fictional (though quite allegorical) and involves involves her ex-husband. It's about him not being able to save his family from a gang of rowdies on a deserted west Texas highway. The story starts getting suspenseful and interesting. We follow the incident, the aftermath, and the lawman who tries to find and bring justice to the rowdies. It starts becoming a gripping revenge thriller.Then it ends.I get it--the ""...stops a beating heart"" reference which was (quite literally) pounded into the audience's ears.

413,nickshenoda,engaging and stylish but unfulfilling,5,18 February 2017,"this is my first ever review. I am writing this not because I particularly and/or excessively liked or hated anything about it, but because there is this aesthetic aura about this movie that piqued my interest more than any other movie I've seen lately. so, starting with the merits of the movie. it has style. this may sound very simple and mediocre but to keep up a classy theme in a movie, especially one that is supposed to communicate with the audiences on a subliminal level, is a hard thing. u can't depend on the costumes and the settings too much because that would make it pretentious and unfeeling. u have to create an air that is posh and appealing and also very human so that the audience feel an attraction and this movie does all that beautifully. the music also helps a lot.the acting is very strong. the aforementioned style is completely embodied by amy adams who shines in this movie. her character is very pragmatic and yet very emotional at the same time, which seems like a completely contradictory blend of traits but she delivers it masterfully, and is a treat to watch. and the flow of the movie. I call it flow because I can't tell where one act ends and the other begins, assuming there are any acts. the movie is very engaging from the start and it is not slow but it is also not fast paced. it just takes you in and you return to the real world only when its finished. now even with all those qualities when the movie finally finishes, you can't help but feel a void. like the story isn't complete. this movie is a revenge tale so naturally you feel approaching towards a climax by the end, but unfortunately it fails to deliver that. while watching it the subtitles suddenly stopped and I found it very odd because that usually happens by the end. so I thought maybe something drastic will happen in these final moments that wouldn't require any dialogues and I was waiting for it when suddenly the screen blacked out. and then the credits rolled. and I felt a little disappointed. the ending sequence is also a bit confusing. I had to read an explanation on the internet to understand what those final moments meant, and I understood it and it even changed the outlook of the entire movie for me. but it still wasn't good enough.",Nocturnal Animals

The latter, the intellect, was all satisfied analyzing the story and the filmmakers formal choices. The set up of a story within a story to explore the interrelations between reality and fiction and their various modes of identification and projection processes was well done. It is a complex narration, but narrated in a way that makes it easy to follow, supported by a clear visual codification. Take for example in the inter cutting sequences binding the books' and the films' reality together: we see Jake Gylenhaal all in hot, red colors and Amy Adams all filtered in blue. The film is full of sharp contrasts like this, giving it a strong expressionistic look and feel. It is moreover performed by a brilliant cast. Especially Michael Shannons' talent is shining quite bright here.But still: I wasn't emotionally moved at all, so, for me, NOCTURNAL ANIMALS is like a puzzle missing the most important piece.",Nocturnal Animals

The movie was mind-grappling within first 15 minutes and then never a boring till the end. And the ending was one of the bests of recent past.Let me say the premises of the movie. An ex-husband writes a novel and lets his ex-wife read that. The novel was a totally fictional one, but as we progress on, we can understand the inspiration behind the novel. As a viewer, you can link different characters of the novel with writer and his wife's real life. The novel itself was good, and the impact the wife feels during reading this novel is fun to watch.

420,Alex-Siddhi,'When you love someone you can't just throw it away',9,19 November 2016,"A truly deeply moving romantic thriller. Right from the very start we are made to feel uncomfortable from the visual art presented before us, I think this is supposed to have some sort of psychological effect on us that attempts to prepares us for what is to follow.We are then introduced to Susan (Amy Adams); The protagonist, who is an artist & exhibitionist who arranges art exhibitions and galleries that seem to have reflected on her own personal life. She seems very confident and successful, but behind the public figure, her life is not fully satisfied. Upon the 2nd act of the film she receives a novel named 'Nocturnal Animals' from her ex-husband who she has not been with nor been in touch with for 20 years, and this is where things get interesting. As she reads the novel, we experience the novel visually so we are getting another story within the story we are watching. Susan's ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) is portraying the protagonist in this novel named Tony Hastings who is a gentle happily married man with a daughter also. The story begins with them driving down a long road in the middle of the desert and soon things turn nasty. The novel offers no positive outcomes and this reflects on the film's mood also. Susan feels heartbroken by the novel but also addicted, and we can really see from Amy's performance that Susan seems to be having some sort of awakening.The stories become entangled with each other and it all becomes very intense, and that is how I would describe this film, it is very successfully and purposely intense.I felt that with my own understanding that this film is not really about the characters but it is about their feelings, their experiences and their emptiness. These elements made the film what it is and they were coursing through the characters and the plot, and it has been created in such a fine way that it is quite unbearable to watch, as you get attached to their feelings and their experiences you truly feel that emptiness inside of Susan, Edward and also Tony. The rest of the characters are also played exceptionally well from Michael Shannon as the vigilant detective & Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the twisted malicious villain.I'm not quite sure what Tom Ford has wanted us to make of this film, and I think for that reason and including the pacing and the narrative of the film, not only is it an intense psychological thriller with romance it is also very surreal, it does seem to have elements of David Lynch and this especially appeals to me.The themes of this film I would say are emptiness, loneliness, confusion, passion and desire, and by the end of this film, I surely felt all of these things.",Nocturnal Animals
421,hellocrocodile,"Now Jake will star in anything, huh?",4,1 June 2018,"The good first. The movie did a very good job in slowly ramping up the tension and unease in the scene where some crazy men accost a family attempting a late night voyage on a mostly deserted road. Yet, you could see that in so many other movies.So its originality you're looking for? Nocturnal Animals strives in earnest to find originality. Therefore, for the first five minutes or so of the film during the opening credits, we are treated to two morbidly obese women shaking around butt naked in slow motion. Sorry to comment on their figure, but they were obviously chosen for that exact purpose, to be sensational. And then that scene really carried no meaning further into the film, other than to establish that our heroine and her husband worked with an art gallery.The slomo cellulite dance is never revisited, thank goodness, but the film ended leaving me with the same sense of ""um, why?"" that it began with. Although not hopelessly vague, I suspect less people would understand what point the movie is trying to make if there wasnt a sentence or two describing the plot of the film that people can read before choosing to watch it. And then even knowing what is supposed to be happening here - women regrets past mistakes and begins to wonder if the scary book her ex husband wrote is a veiled threat - is not rewarded with much of a conclusion.Jake Gyllenhaal's character(s) in the film also came across as... somehow not right for Jake Gyllenhaal. Dialogue marks him as a peceivably ""weak"" man yet the camera titillates over his muscular body; just a small example of the casting paradox that is also felt in other ways I can't describe. It feels like he is forcing himself into a role not written for him. Amy was alright playing the rich mopey girl, but not enough to call the performance exceptional. I give this a 4 because it didn't suck so much as to make me hate the film - I did sit through the entire thing after all. I just feel it deserves considerably less than the average rating. Tom Ford can make a good film, no doubt - so watch A Single Man instead.

427,thing4m4jig,Nocturnal Animals - an analysis,7,3 August 2017,"Hello, dear reader - if by some miraculous coincidence you stumbled upon this review, hidden among others.This will actually be more of an analysis. Two friends had me explain WHAT THIS FILM WAS EVEN ABOUT when they saw I liked it on Facebook. I've also noticed that - as with many art-house movies -- reviews vary from ""A masterpiece!"" to ""This is about NOTHING"". I understand - a lot of films I myself don't get at all or I don't think they deserve the hype. ""Nocturnal Animals"" I get pretty well though, and I can tell you for sure it's not about nothing. So I'll share my thoughts.Spoilers ahead, read after you've watched the film.1. Who is Susan? This movie is best to watch putting yourself in Susan's shoes. You don't have to like her, but you have to understand her. That's especially important when it comes to analyzing Edward's book, since it's obvious that the events from the book that we see on-screen are filtered through her mind. We get drawn into the fictional world when she starts reading and come back whenever she stops.So, who is she? For me Susan is, first and foremost, a person who doesn't fit anywhere.She's pragmatic and cynical, and she knows it. She doesn't like it about herself though; rather she's resigned to accept it. So when as a grad student she bumps into Edward - her brother's childhood friend and her teenage crush -- who infectiously believes she can be more than that, she falls into his arms.One manifestation of what she escapes is the story of her brother. He's gay; their parents have practically disowned him; Susan hates them for it. She tells Edward that her brother once had a crush on him - his reaction: ""I should call him more often"". His different, soft, human approach is what draws her to him.On the other side stands Susan's mother. She's stern and dogmatic but she loves her child. She immediately knows that Susan and Edward aren't right for each other. She warns her daughter that ""We all eventually turn into our mothers"", and that when Susan's organized nature starts showing, she'll hurt Edward.Later it turns out she was right. Edward insists writing is his calling, but he isn't any good. Susan eventually stops believing in him. She needs stabilization. She leaves him for another man, Edward's complete opposite. She aborts Edward's child.But then it turns out she suffocates in her new neat life, too. Her only constant: she doesn't fit. Whomever she's with, she suffers from insomnia (the ""nocturnal animal"", Edward once called her).These are the opposites Susan fluctuates between: chaos and order; Edward's softness and pragmatism that runs in her blood.2. The book. What does Edward say to Susan? However Susan understands the book is indicative of what she thinks Edward wants to communicate with it. So it hints at what happened between them in the past, a lot earlier than the film actually spells it out. Prepare to watch Susan's reactions and then put the puzzles together through her flashbacks.Only after seeing the end do you realize what game Edward was playing all along.He gave the book a title that was their private joke, then dedicated it to Susan. She knew the book was about him -- he'd never stopped ""writing about himself"" when they were together. (That's why she saw Tony as Edward and why Gyllenhaal played both roles).Edward knew Susan felt guilty for what she's done. For a long time after she must have identified Tony's family harassers as the eponymous animals - her counterparts in the book - he kept her uncertain of their intentions. Will they hurt the family? Will they leave them alone? Finally, they killed them, as Susan destroyed her and Edward's relationship and aborted their child. Edward portrayed Tony's grief, letting Susan know: ""Here's what you did to me"". Then he expanded on Ray Marcus -- a mindless psychopath -- sending the message: ""Here's what you are to me now"". Finally, Tony kills Ray and dies himself, which means: ""Writing this killed me, but at least now you're dead too"".Edward's revenge might seem childish. But it shows what power those once-close hold over each other. Edward doesn't have to spell it all out to Susan. She knows she hurt him once and he knows that she knows. He knows that what gives her some peace is the thought that perhaps, with time, he forgave her, or at least understood. He takes that comfort from her.What did Susan do? She left a man she wasn't compatible with. She aborted a baby she didn't want. Whatever your personal opinion of it is doesn't matter; that's not the point. The point is that such things people live with. But Susan now has to live with more than that: the knowledge that she made a person she once loved suffer for the next 20 years. Suffer enough to regret his own softness and humanity (Tony's qualities that made the murder possible). Enough to turn into a man she didn't recognize anymore and to write a book just to make her suffer in turn.3. The ending.I've seen people write THERE IS NO ENDING AT ALL.What happens in the end is this: Edward and Susan arrange for a dinner to discuss the book; she comes and waits; he never appears.It might seem anti-climatic; but if you were in Susan's place, I guarantee you wouldn't say so. She realizes she'll never be absolved; that the worst possible interpretation of Edward's book was the intended one; that this story will soon be published. Maybe become a bestseller. Her past has caught up with her.Thank you for reading and have a great day :)",Nocturnal Animals

An emotion-less and completely inexplicable love story drives the narrative, while emotionally devoid characters play the roles. There is death that's supposed to be tragic, but not at a single place in the movie one can relate to the supposed emotional experience surrounding tragic events.The bad guy does play his role rather good and along with the sheriff is the only good thing in this movie.

I was genuinely interested in the story's progression. CONS1) The opening scene with the incredibly unappealing nude dancers was not welcome. I didn't find it brave or interesting as some critics have. I also think these same critics would have a huge problem with the scene if the dancers were worthy of Playboy. 2) The film, maybe intentionally, is emotionally distant. It works for the story, but it's not especially moving, but the film also isn't good enough to be haunting, either.

Flawed storytelling,7,7 June 2020,"It is always best if you do not read anything about a movie or watch any trailers and go right into it without any expectations. You will have an experience of a lifetime if the movie is well crafted. Though horrific and violent, cinematography is visually stunning and shot in style, quiet crafty to add. Events that occur in the course of time is depicted well with the use of darkness and color to explain the mood of a particular sequence or a scene. I felt a sense of apprehension and uneasiness when edward's wife and daughter are captured by nefarious bunch of crooks. It seemed very real and did not feel like edward was narrating it as part of his fictional novel. Narration lacked clarity and seemed flawed since the script tried to draw a comparison between the gruesome events that unfolded in fictional novel and the writer's pain endured due to failed relationship. It seemed completely unfair and imbalanced to create an analogy of a painful relationship with murder, rape of a teenage girl and her mother.

He (Edward played by Jack Gyllenhaal) never accepted being treated/viewed as a weak person by his now ex-wife (Susan played by Amy Adams), she indeed couldn't truly believe in him becoming a successful/prolific writer. What he did is really clear: he created a fictional family that resembles what they were before divorce and show through the novel what being truly weak means, and he did that by displaying a man totally unable to protect his wife and daughter, and who hasn't enough courage to revenge them. It's like the message of the novel was:""If you think I was weak, look at this man"" and he did that by writing a haunting novel. The scene when she drops her colleague's phone has a painting in the background with a writing: REVENGE, basically what drove him writing the book.

I'm not criticising the fact that rape appears in this movie. Films are allowed to depict this act, but it wasn't done right in this film. The way Tom Ford framed the bodies of the two victims was extremely sexualised and romanticised, focusing on the way their nakeds looked. I don't think he even attempted to capture the horrors of rape. I'm not saying that rape should never be portrayed, but the way it was done in this film felt offensive.I also want to focus on the anti-abortion stance that the movie takes, with the whole book that the husband wrote being an act of revenge for his ex-wife having had an abortion. Yes, because a mother and her daughter being brutally raped and then murdered is the same as a woman choosing to abort her foetus. The two are not comparable at all.Skip this movie.

I don't know why girls usually leave nice guys for being kind, sincere and loyal and call them boring and WEAK. They end a relationship with a nice guy in which real love do exist and go for jerks or rich men. They forget about their ex and don't care about him who will never be the same again.
Finally they are betrayed, by their husband and miss the real hugs and kisses they will never ever experience again in their entire life. They Miss the man who was ready to die for them. Miss the enless kindness and care.
In the end they regret and want to get back to what values the most in this world. Real love.
But it is too late and they have destroyed 2 lives and souls that will never be the same.",Nocturnal Animals
439,vicentenog,"Brilliant Movie, but lacks subtlety.",9,20 February 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is one of those movies that divides opinions. Very few people will be neutral about it, most will either love it or hate it. Lets start the review by commenting on the direction: It was brilliant. I didn't know about this director but i think it is safe to say that this script could have been a disaster in the wrong hands. The art direction is very slick and haunting. At first, i thought i was watching a horror/thriller. The soundtrack is also great and it fits in like a glove.Technically speaking, we have a solid picture, i think even the critics would agree with that.The Plot: An art gallery owner receives a copy of a book written by her ex-husband. The book is dedicated to her. At the point when she receives the book, Susan seems to be having a mild existential crisis. As the movie progresses we see a parallel between the book and Susan's and Edward's past.In the book, a man named Tony is attacked on the road by a group of local criminals who end up killing his wife and child and leaving him in the desert. In real Life, Susan had broken up their marriage after feeling that their relationship lacked things she seemed to need. The movie emphasizes that Edward felt like Susan perceived their relationship as unsatisfactory, even though she loved him. Having never been able to get over their separation, and perceiving the end as a brutal experience, the book reflects Edward's perspective on the end of their marriage. The criminals in the book, The Nocturnal Animals, are a grotesque caricature of Susan, whom Edward used to call a Nocturnal Animal as well. Their reckless, ruthless and sadistic actions seemed to represent how Edward felt about the way how Susan dealt with the end of their relationship. His wife and daughter in the book seemed to represent their marriage, their love and their unborn child, whom Susan aborted shortly after meeting her current husband. In the novel, we also have two characters trying to enact justice; Tony and Detective Bobby. Both of these characters Seemed to represent Edward. While Tony seems emotional and passive, Bobby is brutal, cold and effective, almost like an alter-ego, someone Tony needs in order to achieve his revenge. At every step of the way Bobby seems to encourage and drive Tony towards his goal of having justice for his family. By doing this, Bobby prevents Tony from moving on with his life and letting go of the anger and sadness that plagues him. A Dying man, Bobby says many times that he has nothing to lose and that he doesn't care about the repercussion of his actions. At the end of the novel, Tony achieves his revenge but is hurt during a struggle and ends up accidentally shooting himself in the stomach, this causes him to die in the desert alone. In real life, Susan, who has had her love for Edward slightly re-kindled with constant memories of their past together, is invited by him for an amicable meeting in the form of a dinner on a tuesday night.In the final scene of the movie, real life seems to imitate fiction as Edward has his revenge on Susan by not showing up to their dinner reunion. Much like the character in his novel, real life Edward achieves his goals by not letting go of his hurt and possibly at the cost of true happiness.It is a movie about heart break and its themes are universal. Having praised the good parts, lets mention the biggest movie flaw: The character of Susan. Even with a masterful and subtle portrayal by actress Amy Adams, this is the only aspect in which the movie falls short. While you can clearly see the screenwriter or the author of the novel in Edward and all of his alter egos, there is also too much of him on Susan as well. The Character seems submissive, tame, and overly repentful for no reason at all. Even though she emphasizes how long she hasn't spoken to Edward for, Susan seems way more remorseful than she should be if we were talking about a real person. Many times she says she has done brutal, unexcusable things to her poor ex-husband and that he should never forgive her. Being a highly successful gallery owner she seems to question her life choices and everything she has done since breaking up with poor Edward, to the point where she seems almost guilty about her success because of her betrayal. The symbolism in this movie is very explicit, that is OK for the most part. The overly repentant approach to the character of Susan, however, gives light to the redemption fantasies of the author/screenwriter in a way that should have been invisible. This causes the character to behave in a very unrealistic/submissive way.This a big flaw for which im taking two points from my review. I have seen at least one review on this site in which the author called the movie mysoginistic and i have to say i understand where the author in question is coming from. For a movie that was executed in such a masterful way, with good acting and direction, this lack of subtlety is unexcusable. Overall i think Nocturnal Animals is definitely one of the best movies of 2016 and i highly recommend it.",Nocturnal Animals

Moi??,4,11 March 2017,"I like a good thriller or thinker movie, but I'm writing this to tell you - I was bored It's a balancing act to combine stylised noir with a road killer thriller and unfortunately this falls short This film feels like it could have been great, nothing to fault in the plot, or actors and the cinematography is beautiful - but it's really not complicated but dresses itself to look complicated. anyway, plus: It's existentialism gone mad ;-) Beautifully shot acting is top drawer interesting plot, complicatedminuses: It's existentialism gone mad ;-) boring plot, not complicated It's very easy to predict after watching Adaptation, Lost Highway this feels inferiorI don't know who this film is aimed at but if it's my demographic (middle-class, educated, 44 yrs) it seems a transparent attempt at 'cool' - and to be honest this film really dragsI don't have any inclination to think about this film anymore, I'm done.Shame as it could have been better",Nocturnal Animals
441,jerzykunce32,Great film,10,28 November 2016,"Nocturnal animals hunt for forgiveness... This is a really great film. Firstly, visual side of the movie is just marvellous - the colours are full and intense in contrast to the hollowness of the souls and nakedness of the hearts of the main characters. The music is hard to describe because it's ideally synchronized with the drama - you can't extract the pain from the scream which manifests it or tears from the sorrow they express... Finally, the plot develops itself on 3 different dimensions simultaneously - all three dimensions are dark and desolated.. forgotten lands where human beasts prey on silence of their victims. The acting is perfect - the roles aren't just played, there is no falsehood or afectation in them. You feel the truth of every movement, gesture and word - the only lie you discover is that you watch only a film as an neutral observer, because in fact you're an active participant.. you're also guilty of the love you've lost... I can heartily recommend this film to everyone who's looking for the real art - that which doesn't teases the senses or satisfy moods but the real art which sacrifices happiness or success and fights to reveal the deep.",Nocturnal Animals

443,Jacklilcookie-27-358821,"No matter how much you dress it, s*** is still s***",1,6 May 2017,"First of all, I am really curious about how they got a 15 age restriction in the USA, I wonder if these guys have actually watched the film to rate it so. Second of all, I do not say this lightly and I have watched many historical dramas or documentaries that did not interest me but I have never watched a film as boring as this one. The film simply does not have a strong story. It targets rich people at their 30s, I believe, and I am sure that's where it gets its rating boosted.What is good about this film? Well the music, the colours, visuals... They reflect the feelings really good. I give them that. However, I believe everyone was aware how light and useless the story was that they just tried to hide it all behind the visually 'arty' scenes and musics. Yet, they have tried it so hard that after a moment it felt really exaggerated.What is really bad about this film? Story. Superficial and pumped with the boring Hollywood thriller clichés. It lacks any kind of logic or a foundation under it. It gives no explanations but this does not make it a deeper story as this is not a mystery film. On the contrary, it gives no explanations because it fails to develop the characters and remain quite superficial. I hoped to watch a suspenseful thriller with a complicated story. I got a disgusting, sexually over empathised film, that does not tell you a story but just tries to make you feel some feelings, especially if you can associate with the characters yourself as I am sure a few do. It tries to ask and question life but does it very superficially. Yet in the end it tries too hard to give the feelings that you just respond with a yawn, mumble 'seriously' and check the time to see how long this torture of boredom is gonna last for. It could have been an amazing film but for that the story should have been developed, expanded, rewritten. My verdict: It has too many clichés for an 'art' film. It has too superficial story for a thriller. And it conveys all the drama through visual art to cover the 'weak' story.",Nocturnal Animals

445,sparkytx,Pointless story within a story about cliché revenge movie,2,11 October 2017,"The initial premise was interesting enough. A woman gets a manuscript from her ex husband. The manuscript is going to reflect their failed relationship. The story is about a bunch of west Texas raving yahoos who terrorize a family. It is a very poor mans deliverance. The script is so lame, it is obviously the ex husband's anger against the wife and daughter that had rejected him. That was the forty five minute mark. The rest of script plays out like a really slow revenge movie. Then it is over. There is no interaction between the husband and the wife. That really makes the story within the story completely pointless. It really hard to imagine that if you were given the opportunity to make a major motion picture, anyone would choose this story to make.",Nocturnal Animals

This story within a story does not because both Jake and Amy's characters look the same after 20 years apart. The only version is the old Jake had a Beard. I've read different interpretations of the ending; I have one of my own ....... Jake does not show up at the restaurant because at that same moment he is Killing the rapist's of his wife and daughter and dying in the process..... the film goes back and forth between Amy in the bathtub and Jake in the desert bleeding to death after murdering the rapists as in the background it sounds like a heartbeat.

The storyline has so much potential. I was left with a sense of wanting more. I wanted to know more. I wanted to know what happened with all of the characters. I felt like this was the first part of a miniseries. The storyline & feel of the movie was dark. I just keep going back to the word unfinished. Nothing was resolved. Nothing was explained.

449,alex_pearse,More style than substance?,6,13 November 2016,"At the outset, i should make it clear that i don't think this is a bad film, but i felt the need to add a dissenting voice to the collection of positive reviews that i've read so far.The film is an amalgamation of elements that should work beautifully, but ultimately resembles one of the sterile offerings to be found in Susan's gallery. The acting is superb throughout, and the nuanced performances of Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal are worthy of their reputations. The subtle transitions from dead and lifeless to young and vibrant, exhibited by the former at various stages of the film, is one of the most striking features of the piece. The film is beautifully shot and well directed, and there are some truly moving scenes in parts. However, as one reviewer has already alluded to, the film feels like it is desperate to say something, but ultimately says very little. Perhaps i just didn't get it at all.The problem i had was with a lack of emotional connection to either of the main protagonists. It's interesting to find out what happens to both as the film builds, but ultimately i didn't care either way.My partner and i spent some time examining the film on the way home, discussing the parallels between the story at the heart of the film, and the realities that continue around it, but despite our rudimentary analysis of what each one meant for the other, and an understanding that there are some clever parallels, what remained was the underlying sense of ""so what?"".",Nocturnal Animals

I'm going to make a note to review other Tom Ford films, and to keep an eye out for his future efforts. I'm not sure everyone could relate to the theme but I could. Lots of lessons here. Movie: Choices have consequences for ourselves and those our lives touch. You can't crap on those who love you most and expect them to want to be in your life. What goes around comes around. Living a self-absorbed life often means you'll end up wanting, lonely and alone.

452,soerenbruns,The Beauty of Ambiguity,9,20 January 2017,"When more and more money is a at stake in the movie business which causes the big studios increasingly to play it safe by sticking to simple formulas when it comes to plot, any deviation from a traditional three act structure can already be considered 'unconventional'. The first of the many turns Tom Ford's second film 'Nocturnal Animals' takes, is that the viewer relatively early realises that, despite the cinematography which is more Fincher than Fincher and an A-List lead with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal, she is about to witness anything but a Hollywood mainstream thriller.The story revolves around Susan (Amy Adams) who is a successful but depressed gallery owner and lives unhappily with her second husband in a huge and very lonely mansion. One night her first husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) whom she married when they were in college sends her the manuscript of a book he wrote called 'Nocturnal Animals'. The passages she reads are transformed into visual scenes that make up a story within the story. Automatically you try to spot parallels and connections between her life and the story of the book. But Tom Ford complicates things further by implementing a third story line that consists of memories of Susan and Edward's relationship that ended quite harshly. The film freely jumps from one branch to another and creates a veritable maze for the viewer in which it is a joy to get lost. Once you think you have figured out where all of this is going, you are confronted with a scene that seems to be completely at odds with everything you have seen before. 'Nocturnal Animals' thereby leaves room for many different interpretations, which is refreshingly in contrast to Hollywood's overkill of exposition and the compulsive urge to resolve every little bit by the end. Fittingly, the film ends on a very ambiguous note where the biggest twist is that there is no twist that smoothly fills the gaps and ties all three story lines together. It is however not chaotic but very well thought through. You can distil a single consistent story from the film, but nine other people will probably come up with nine different versions. Therefore, I urge you not to go see 'Nocturnal Animals' by yourself. Whether you like it or not, you will want to talk about this film. A lot. Just as Susan is haunted by her ex-husband's manuscript, this film sticks with you for a long time. Apart from the beautiful contrasts in visuals between the cold, bleak reality of Susan's current life, the Coenesque Neo-Western grittiness of the fictional story of the book and the dreamy atmosphere of the memory sequences as well as the challenging and complex script (an undeservingloss at the Golden Globes that hopefully will be corrected by the Academy), the icing on the cake are the brilliant performances by Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. The former just rounds up her perfect year by neatly distinguishing this tortured woman from Arrival's Louise by distancing the audience at first but then drawing it in with every second the film progresses. Gyllenhaal on the other hand simply continues his almost flawless run of the past years by showing off his extraordinary capabilities as an actor whether his character is trying to remain calm while being obviously terrified, buzzing with joy when he falls in love with Susan or expresses ultimately raw rage where he seems to be about to break out of the screen. To this the film adds a strong supporting cast including Aaron Taylor-Johnson (at least the Golden Globes got that right), Michael Shannon, Laura Linney and the always welcomed Jena Malone who are all on top of their game here.'Nocturnal Animals' is a highly emotional ride that is equally structurally compelling as it is relatable on a personal level. It is something like a Rubrick's cube of a film that you put together differently every time but never get completely straight. And that's exactly why it is so fascinating to watch.",Nocturnal Animals
453,kinsmanivan,This is the movie of 2016,10,1 December 2016,"The standout feature of Tom Ford is his ability to bring visual art to the cinematic screen - the film has a fantastic glossy feel to it in terms of the panoramic scenery and the many close ups of the individual actors in this film. The opening scenes of the film are extraordinary and you remain totally gripped as the plot slowly unwinds.The plot is a very clever story within a story combined with a revenge theme. Amy Adams (American Hustle) puts in a very strong performance as a hard-soft woman who leaves her 'sensitive' writer husband in the lurch to fall for a business tycoon-type who also, as she finds out, is leaving her in the lurch. Jake Gyllenhall plays a dual role as Edward, a young writer, and also Tony, the husband and father of two women who are savagely raped and murdered on a road trip through West Texas. However, for me the stand-out performance is by Michael Shannon (Boardwalk Empire) who plays are hard boiled Texas policeman who, with Tony's assistance, is determined to find the killers and bring them to justice, either within or outside the law.This is a must-see art house-,style film that is the product of one of the best current directors (along with Derek Cianfrance ['Blue Valentine', 'The Light between Oceans'] and also similar in style to Jonathan Glazer ['Sexy Beast'/Ray Winstone]) making extremely appealing films.",Nocturnal Animals
454,artbookguy,A Stunning and Original Art Film,9,24 December 2016,"After merely two major release films (see: ""A Single Man""), it's probably safe to say that Tom Ford has mastered the art of cinematic storytelling.It's not just about telling a great story, it's also about creating a cinematic experience that you're delightfully basking in and enjoying. Of course, you can ask, ""Isn't that what film making is all about?""Yes, but there's something that sets Director Tom Ford apart. It's obviously the fact that he's an accomplished designer and businessman, but I also think it's about his imagination. I mean, this guy's films are very contemporary yet harken back to old Hollywood.Let's be honest. When I heard Tom Ford had a new film out starring Amy Adams who was playing an art dealer in Los Angeles?Count me IN.""Nocturnal Animals"" is a gripping, detective thriller ... a story within a story. That's all I'll say. Yet it's also very human and empathetic and yes, sophisticated. Amy Adams has to be thrilled by the way she's photographed in this film. She's gorgeous and as usual, uses her eyes to great advantage to tell her character's story.Jake Gyllenhaal also conjures up a great performance of a man done wrong and out for revenge. Michael Shannon is also a heavyweight in this film. He's a real actor who disappears in his roles. This is really the best that any actor can hope for whether they're a ""movie star"" or not.Also, I've got to give a couple of shout outs for Laura Linney who absolutely kills her one scene in this entire film and Michael Sheen who gets a couple of fantastic lines to live by.This film is such a compelling, visceral experience. Keep in mind that Ford directed this AND wrote the screenplay, so this is another Tom Ford production of the highest order. In short, he designed this film. It's beautifully bespoke.Make no mistake, this is indeed an art film. You'll see this immediately during the opening credits and take note of how Ford segues from the credits to the first scene. Masterful. In fact, contemporary art plays a major role throughout the film. Love it.In short, Nocturnal Animals is an enthralling piece of cinema and shouldn't be missed by those who love contemporary art or those who don't. -- Michael K.

I can see this being one of those films that will hit home for many of the modern day singles who have earned their scars in the battle for romance. I wasn't sure what to really think at first when the film started, but it definitely started catching my attention about 1/4 way in. The plot description doesn't really do it much justice, but the film itself does a good job at carrying itself through right to the end.

457,zoricaristevska,"""Enjoy the absurdity of our world""",8,14 July 2017,"I set up my own account especially for this film. I have never even rated or reviewed anything on IMDb before. It is not that this is the best movie there is, it just made me, the viewer, to write what I feel about it. Hardly for me to think that a former fashion designer would be the reason for me to break the silence. Just as Gyllenhaal's character says when asked what had driven him so much to write: ""I guess it is a way of keeping things alive"". Well, I never would have thought that Ford had what the great ones had. You cannot be neglected with this film. It is said that artists tend to represent themselves, or tell stories about themselves in their art, but no big ego emerges from the feeling of the film. I am not talking about the way Ford rejected the possibility for his own clothing line to be used in the movie, but for the way the viewer, or I at least, got the impression that not in the least was I ever put in the second place – in every scene taken care of, being given little gifts, may it be a perfect sky and landscape cinematography, may it be thought provoking conversation of the characters that makes you reflect about yourself. Some movies only take your mind of everything temporarily, or give homework to your thought, but it really does rarely happen to be able to take something great from them. It is truly a great gift to make the perceiver of your art to be willing to change something about themselves. Not just to purely enjoy or be entertained.Since one of the first scenes, where we see Adams' character standing in her home, behind boxes labeled ""Fragile"", I knew that I was in the mercy of a great storyteller. This, and a whole list of other beautiful non-verbal scenes are the strength this film gets its beauty from. Later we see an enormous painting of Re-ven-ge, and as the main heroine, we too become aware of the plot that is about to take place. As an unhappy, high society woman gets out of nowhere, after almost two decades, a violent and depressing book from her former husband, the tone of the movie is definitely set. Even though, she has hurt him immensely in the past, the book is dedicated to her, and its author had the decency before printing to send its work to the same person who didn't think enough of him or believed in his talent to write. What's interesting, is that Adams character is not happy in the present (she's become her greatest fear and worry, a snob, closed, lonely woman, too distracted from the real world, i.e. like her mother), nor she was in the past, when she was enjoying the love of the good and romantic author of the now sad novel in front of her. We don't get to see the former husband in the present. We don't know if he's happy or completely lost in sorrow or pain, we only get to see his work. And his work is amazing. Even the once rigorous critic of his writing, his former wife, now is captivated by his book. The reason may be, that her husband only because of the pain she caused him, was capable through his sorrow to give birth to his well worthy art. Ford says in the movie to take care of the people who love us, to nurture that love, since it is not for granted. The main message of the film is powerful, but for me, those short and beautiful dialogues made the trick. For example, the scenes with Michael Sheen and Andrea Riseborough, are the best part of the film for me. The dilemmas of having a gay loyal husband or a straight unfaithful one, or the guilt that eats up the well-to-do high society members for being too lost of touch with the reality of the world. ""What right do I have to be unhappy? I have everything,"" one of them asks. ""I feel ungrateful for being unhappy."" Far more experienced directors have failed to capture internal turmoils and philosophical journeys as the Ford's second child have. For everyone that desires to be pierced by beauty, I recommend this film.",Nocturnal Animals
458,aka_tourette,expensive student movie,4,9 November 2016,"Looks like a movie done by a beginner, which I'm not sure Tom Ford is. It's shot in digital so everything looks pretty flat, especially the open areas. The movie is very slow, with too long scenes, awkward and irrelevant dialogues. There is also a typical liberal Hollywood moment with characters labelled as ""bourgeois, conservative, racist, Christian, materialist, republicans"". I'm not kidding. A personage makes this characterization of some people, like reading from The Social Justice Warrior Hand Book. It almost made me leave the theatre. The action sequences are not very dynamic and fall flat. The slow, human interaction, scenes are all close shots. No environment present. Very low environmental sound, which gives you the impression the characters talk alone in an empty room. The synopsis on IMDb is misleading. ""Violent thriller she interprets as a veiled threat and a symbolic revenge tale""? There's almost no trace of that in the movie. The main female character reads this simple and not very original story novel manifesting some strange anguishes which you can't link together with anything happening.

459,nima-azad,Where is creativity to write a decent story line ?!,2,18 February 2018,"As a fiction writer is see no novelty in recent movies that I watch lately. This included nocturnal animals. A good movie needs more than good acting. Or beautiful cinematography to pass standard measures of an average film. Jake Gyllenhaal is one the most promising young actors for sure. But this film lakes meaning after spending I hour 56 minutes. 
A family man (Jake Gyllenhaal ) lost his family violently and seemingly without any reason. A local low enforcer helps him to get trace two of suspects. I don't know what happened to the third one. It's getting more revenge movie type more and more. There are so many movies about murder, finding justice out of low, looking for relieve in vengeance. What this movie adds up to our experience? Just a desperate man finding a killer and yet is not sure what to do. 
There is a parallel story line about Susan (Amy Adams). She clearly has some emotional problems about her past. Mostly with her ex-husband Edward (also played with Jake Gyllenhaal). What does it got to do with the other story? In some points this film reminds of David Lynch's movie, lost highway. 
Why same actors appear in both storylines? What's the dramatic point of this? Who is who eventually? Is there any need to follow Susan's emotional conflicts through a bloody vengeance and nightmare like back story? 
What's a point of this film? I don't get it. Another poor script and loose connections whit events to form a general idea or something. I felt deceived after watching this movie and some many others like this.",Nocturnal Animals
460,guitarfunk420,Amazingly well constructed thought provoking emotional thriller,9,28 August 2017,"I'm normally not into films that could be classified as ""emotional dramas"", but this movie was really good if you can make it through the opening credits which had me just repeating ""WHY... WHY... PLEASE STOP NO!""What I liked about this movie is that the sub plot of her ex husbands book could stand alone as it's own movie in terms of the raw entertainment value. I found it extremely disturbing, tense, and really just made me think about how scary it is that this kind of stuff happens in real life.Some people are just plain evil and I think this movie portrays a lot of what's wrong with the world both in terms of the physical pain endured by crime victims and the scarring emotional pain of their friends and family. This film ties together the most extreme horrors of the world in his book and parallels it with the much more common emotional traumas like losing the love of your life through a divorce. Although in reality there is obviously a huge difference between your loved ones being victims of a crime compared to getting a divorce... the point is that your heart may be broken or destroyed either way. Interpreting the exact details of how she feels in the end ""could"" be quite complicated I suppose, and maybe that's why some people don't understand the movie or they think it's pointless. But to me just watching the movie the first time everything made perfect sense, I was never confused and I never wondered what was the meaning of a certain scene or why was it included. I could be wrong but to me she deeply regrets losing and hurting the man that loved her so very much, but at this point it's too late. She is a good person at heart but ultimately too superficial, just like her mother the exact person she never wanted to be. Because of this she was unable to be satisfied in what she now realizes was the man she truly loved. She changed her life in a way that brought her great monetary success, but she lost the one who truly loved her and was happy to be with her (unlike her current husband). She will have to live with her mistakes, psychologically isolated and forever unhappy just like her ex husband. Realizing the future ahead of her and the finality of the damage she had done made her extremely sad which can be seen in the last close up of her face.I believe she wants to reach out to her ex husband and try to somehow make things better but now she knows she'll never get the chance. I don't believe that her ex husband wanted revenge on her by sending her the book, he probably just wanted her to finally like his work. All he ever wanted was for her to believe in him as a writer the way he believed in her as an artist. It seems very clear to me that he still loves her... the problem is that by this point he is so permanently damaged that it is hopeless for them to be together even if he finally wrote a (assumed) successful book. That is the irony, it took her destroying his heart for him to be able to create a story powerful enough for her to see his worth as a writer and fulfill her requirements as a partner(someone successful). The revenge was self inflicted and inevitable for both of them, for him he is so broken he can't even summon the courage to see her again, for her she can't find happiness no matter what she does and realizes that he is gone forever.",Nocturnal Animals
461,tzachn,A Wonderful Experience,9,6 June 2017,"I watched this movie without any expectations and I have to say I was extremely impressed with just how well Tom Ford has executed his first film.First off, the casting is brilliant and the filming is mesmerizing and phenomenal. This film is an absolute eye candy to watch, furthermore, the plot is complex, intriguing and keeps you guessing throughout most of the film.I particularly admired just how well the film blends the real world, a sleek, modern and upscale reality which Susan lives in, compared to the die hard southern American environment and characters which are portrayed in the novel. It's a combination of complete Black vs White, but it fits in perfectly. The film is packed with symbolism and visual aids which help you connect the dots in order to interpret the plot and the ending to me was exactly what I expected.As a fashionable person it was also very nice to see how aesthetically pleasing this film is, as it's directed by such a great designer, it just goes to show that creativity can span farther and greater than one's main occupation in life and I think Tom Ford has done an excellent job on this film. Looking forward to seeing his next works.I also think that this film should really be ranked higher than a 7.5, for me it's a 9.",Nocturnal Animals
462,craysellers,Everything but convincing,6,10 July 2018,"The excessive privilege of Susan's world of artists and entitled people is a beautiful cinematic experience. If the story stayed at that level this would be a masterpiece. When she receives a copy of her ex-husband's book, she sees his metaphor for how and why she left him, and what it felt like through his eyes. We see the mother's warning about romanticizing someone who will never be the man she wants him to be. Her guilt over succumbing to social pressure, that's what she can't forgive about herself; that's what she says, but her actual relationship with Edward doesn't bear it out.
Her mother was right. She's in love with the man she wants Edward to be, but Edward - the real Edward - the man she's disappointed in and exasperated with? They have a boring, unfulfilling relationship and she wants out. The movie isn't honest about this detail and it's too important to ignore. She claims, later on, to have really loved him, and her claim is convincing. Even the husband she left Edward for, he cheats on her and she knows it, but she gets him because she has more respect for him as a man. If the director (Tom Ford) didn't mean to show that, it's incompetence. If her relationship with Edward was love, that's not shown, and Ford took a hard swing at it and missed.",Nocturnal Animals

I often feel guilty because I give too many movies a rating of 8-10, when the average is about a 6.5. I like movies. I watch a movie to be entertained, and if a movie does a good job of entertaining me, I like to give positive ratings... So I want to repeat, I am NOT hard to please. I'm very easy. That being said, most of my ratings are just that, a rating. Very rarely will I actually type out a review. I'm doing so now as a plea to other individuals out there, do NOT watch this movie, or rather, do NOT waste 2 hours of your life watching a miserable story play out... This couldn't be worse. What kind of sicko decides to make an 'artsy' movie out of every mans/husbands/fathers worst nightmare? Why did I actually continue watching?! I judge myself for putting up with it. I mean come on, I should have given in and turned it off when 15 minutes into the movie, I'm watching some redneck scumbags drag a mans wife and daughter away from their car to do potentially terrible things while the father/husband does essentially nothing to stop the perpetrators. But no, I kept on going. So then I should have turned it off 15 minutes later when you find the mans wife and daughter lying dead and naked, draped together in a death embrace (is this supposed to be 'beautiful' or 'artistic'?!). So his wife and daughter were raped and murdered... NOW is where I stopped watching, right? No, I kept going. Shame on me. So then I get to watch the utterly slow drama of how the perpetrators are eventually found by a dying police officer, and 'revenge' (if you want to call it that) is had in the end, only to then die in the process of carrying out that revenge... Then we get to watch the main character sip wine in a restaurant for like 3 minutes for no reason whatsoever, aaaaand cut to black, roll credits... REALLY!?!? I'm all for violent movies. I'm all for drama. Heck I'm even all for an artsy fartsy flick once in a while. But THIS garbage needs to be avoided by anyone looking to be entertained. If you are after a movie to be angered, bothered, tormented, and disgusted, then sure, go for it. But if you're like me and you enjoy watching movies to be entertained, do yourself a favor and move on to the next movie you've been curious about. All that being said, the ONE redeeming part of this movie is the acting. Great acting. But it's got a great cast, so I would expect nothing less...

470,athanasaka,"It was dark, but it was beautiful",8,6 January 2017,"I must say that i liked the movie It was one of those movies that you watch and then you think about it for days or even weeks and you find out something new each time you bring it to your mind, and that exact aspect of the cinema i love. Also it was a good movie, with great actors, they could drag you in their harsh world, it had feelings, all kinds of them, during the movie you could feel the suspense and the anxiety but you could also feel sadness and pity and hope ( don't mistake it it wasn't a hopeful movie at all). About the director i must admit that i wasn't very positive on the film because of him, but i was surprised, he was able to take a scenario and get it to the screen creating suspense but also giving out the contrast between the characters and the similarities between them in a way that made you feel that they were the same person but in the same time they belonged to different worlds. the thing i loved the most though was its darkness, it was the directors way to show all the problems of the modern world not in a social movie but in a thriller and that on its own is a miracle, it was harsh and abrupt and at many points i felt i didn't want to see but i couldn't stop watching. It kind of reminded me an ancient Greek tragedy, it gave you an ethical problem(how to ensure justice) and through pain and fear it led you to redemption, not revenge as many wanted to see but redemption, and in the end as every ancient Greek tragedy it didn't had a happy end, as once again many wanted. On the negative parts, the movie let me wondering about aspects of the characters, who were they and stuff. Also there was a sub- plot no one cared about. I understand the director did it to slow down the movie but he could have done a better job there and lastly the end was a bit sloppy and fast contrary to the rest of the movie. In the end it just felt like he run out of time and he closed it up really fast. On the whole if you want to watch that movie you must be prepared that it is going to be hard on you, and in the end you will have many questions unanswered that you will need to think for yourself which is exactly the beauty of the film.

471,shihanyu,"A beautiful and thrilling film, with a few shortfalls",8,26 May 2017,"After watching the movie, I was a little unsure of how I interpreted the movie and how I felt about it. However, after mulling the film over for a few hours, I can conclude that it was a good movie.Director Tom Ford attempts to show a man's (Edward's) transformation and emotions after a heartbreaking experience in his life, specifically through the perspective of his ex-wife, Susan. Ford beautifully intertwines three sections: the past, the present, and a novel story line written by Edward, into a two hour film. The phenomenal editing of the movie and the thrilling parallels between the reality and the novel definitely helped Ford achieve what he intended to show the audience: a beautiful chaos of a man's life being turned upside down and the transformation that results from it.The three sections are depicted beautifully through the photography, each with their own distinct style. The acting was good, as can be expected from Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Gyllenhaal impressively depicts the emotions of a man who undergoes the worst nightmare a husband/father can experience. Adams does a good job of portraying the frustration, confusion, and desperation of a woman unhappy with her life. Shannon and Taylor-Johnson are phenomenal in their character portrayals in Edward's story, despite the novel story line being disturbingly dark overall.The costume design was also pleasing to the eye, as can be expected from a famous fashion designer turned film director.To share a few dislikes: The film seems to want to show a lot of emotions, thoughts, and symbolism, but ends up not completing most of the attempts. Not saying that the movie is missing any components nor is it a cliff hanger, but the concepts or messages that Tom Ford tries to give to the viewer seem incomplete. He himself says that he tries to ""put a lot of things in the film that maybe you wouldn't see the first time,"" but his use of the symbols (like the red sofa, the cross necklace, the green Pontiac, Ray's ring, and Susan's wedding ring) don't really come full circle to wrap up the concepts they introduce.Altogether though, Ford delivers a thrilling motion picture that stays in the viewers' mind as they attempt to mull it over and understand the director's intentions.",Nocturnal Animals

474,idxx-79688,A movie you like the next day,8,16 November 2017,"So this has another Jake Gyllenhaal weird ending. I guess he only likes weird movies these days. The ending obviously is the talking point of the movie. And it's kind of a downer.But in retrospect the movie makes sense, just not at the time. In my case, at the end I totally understood the parallels to the book he wrote and his life. That the abduction of the women was tied to the loss of his aborted daughter and divorce of his wife. And that he was angry about it. What I anticipated was that Tony was going to carry out the ""REVENGE"" in a similar fashion. That he was going to kill Susan's new husband or some other outrageous plan. But nope, it wasn't that exciting or dramatic.Revenge in this movie is kind of a bitch move. Don't show up to a dinner invited. Wow, what revenge! I guess for Tom Ford, being gay and a fashion designer for Gucci, this is the sort of thing that passes as outrageous revenge.But because I anticipated more, the movie actually was confusing at the end. And a huge downer. Oh, he didn't show up. The end. Uh...what?? But in retrospect, again, the movie actually is more satisfying. As a straight man it is sort of a nice revenge on a woman that throws you to the side because she's weak then thinking she can simply get you back not realizing what a bitch she was and how you no longer want her.The drinking of the whiskey in the same glass refers to who is the loser. At first it's Tony, then he gets his crap together, then it's Susan. Tony realizes that the only reason he was with a loser was because he was a loser.The one thing I hated about the movie was the opening. With the overweight women dancing naked. Ford says this is symbolic of Tony exposing himself creatively. I thought that was complete nonsense. If Tom Ford had been on stage waving his tiny penis, then I'd get it. Instead what it represented to me was a director/producer hiding behind his fashion, exploiting other people and their flaws to self-aggrandize himself. I thought it was appalling and Tom Ford looks like an self-important jerk. ""Hey look I'm putting myself out there, showing my insecurities...by showing other people's insecurities"".

What's to like there? Her previous husband sends her a book he dreamed up about a family being attacked with the mother and daughter being raped and murdered. Should we like this guy? Her current husband is screwing anything that walks besides her. Not much to look up to there ( well, maybe ). It just goes on and on, developing characters no one would ever care about. I can't spoil the plot because I didn't make it that far.

Twoblending story lines were engaging and you cannot help but feel for the lead characters. To me this film was about loneliness, choice, about decisions we make in our lives and how it affects us, like choosing the path, what kind of person you want to be and how social conditioning changes your choice and what happens when people choose the easy way out instead of following their heart. As well as not letting go of the past. The acting is great, Jake Gyllenhall and Amy Adams are so raw and emotional.

484,robert_lamothe,Pseudo Intellectual Prattle,2,25 March 2017,"When I saw the trailers for Nocturnal Animals in the theater I thought it would be a film I'd like to see. Generally I've enjoyed Amy Adams since I saw her as the irrepressible Gisele in Enchanted. However, since she became a Movie Star she's become less daring, choosing roles that seem more avant-garde but require less depth. Susan in Nocturnal Animals was such a role.It isn't so much that Amy Adams has become sterile in her performances, but this wasn't a great script either. Clearly Susan's ex husband Edward and his protagonist Tony were meant to represent the same man. In a flashback sequence Adam's Susan tells Edward he should write about something other than himself to which Edward replies all writers write about themselves. This exchange makes it clear, if it wasn't already, that Tony's ordeal in the desert with the death of his wife and daughter were a reflection of Edward's discovery of Susan's abortion and simultaneous infidelity.This film seem timely given today's conflation of victim with virtue, the greater you've been victimized the greater virtue you can claim. Susan's betrayal and divorce of Edward were no doubt horrible and difficult for Edward, but no more than what happens to millions of men each year, in that respect Edward is a member of a very large club. It does not rise to the level of horror a man would experience to be run off the road, have his wife and daughter kidnapped, raped, and murdered. Tony is a fictional victim in a fictional story. Edward may deserve sympathy for the callous treatment he received from Susan in their divorce, but sympathy does not equate to virtue and Edward definitely deserves no virtue from the suffering of his fictional protagonist Tony.That the film attempts to elevate victim to virtue is as strong a theme as revenge. In one scene Adams encounters Jena Malone in an art museum in front of a painting that contains the word ""Revenge"" painted in white letters on a black background. Nothing subtle here.Nocturnal Animals leaves us with a story that doesn't end so much as it just stops. The final frames of the film have Susan sitting in a restaurant with a waiter bringing her several drinks as she waits for an Edward who never shows. If failing to show up is virtuous Edwards greatest idea of revenge then Edward is the wimp Susan's mom said he was.",Nocturnal Animals

486,thegreathealer,Sleepless in L.A.,8,17 April 2017,"If the tagline for this film went something like 'Woman reads book' then it's likely only the most hardened of cinephile would even consider giving it attention. However, attention is just what 'Nocturnal Animals' deserves, and then some. Opening with the strangest - not to mention explicit - set of credits (overweight nude dancers wearing little more than majorett hats and their vanity) we meet Susan (Amy Adams), an icily cold gallery artist whose latest opening leaves her feeling unfulfilled and lonely in the absence of husband Hutton (Arnie Hammer), an art buyer who we learn spends much of his waking life travelling from one side of America to the other in the vain hope of bolstering a struggling business (he's also screwing his PA, of which Susan learns thanks to a careless bellboy remark later that night). As if her depression couldn't get any deeper, a mysterious package contains the manuscript to a book called 'Nocturnal Animals', written by - and dedicated to her - by former husband Edward. What elapses are two stories told in parallel: first, Susan's emotional journey as she reads the novel and recalls the rise and fall of her twenty-year dead marriage; secondly is the plot of 'Nocturnal Animals' novel: a revenge tragedy in which Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal, also Edward Sheffield) and his family set across Texas on a roadtrip, only to be railroaded by a bunch of hillbillies led by Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) resulting in the abduction and subsequent rape and murder of Tony's wife and daughter.It is the bulk of this second story that not only provides much of the plot of 'Nocturnal Animals', but also an insight into the mindset of an author who has chosen such a violent and personal story to dedicate to his ex-wife. As we learn during Susan's flashbacks, husband Edward was a talented but passionless writer, seen by Susan's bigoted mother (Laura Linney) as weak - following the death of his father - and sensitive by Susan until she grows tired of the literary onanism that presages the collapse of their marriage. Delicate Edward does not take well to her criticism, accusing her of lacking any creative desire despite her Art/History major, and as the pair go their separate ways, Susan discover she is pregnant and is supported by second husband Hutton to abort it before Edward finds out. However, as they leave the clinic, Edward is there, and the seeds of his novel are planted. 'Nocturnal Animals' is then an allegorical story of the collapse of a relationship, and the way it makes a humdrum writer of self-absorbed fiction into one whose rhetoric not only cuts deep but has Susan confront some long-buried realisations about herself and the choices she has made.Writer/director Tom Ford skilfully weaves the two stories from Austin Wright's source novel 'Tony and Susan', depicting the fictional Tom as an emasculated character whose weakness and self-doubt leads to the capture and death of his family. At times Ford's subtext is oblique - when the bodies of his wife and daughter are discovered, they not only recall the 'dead' exhibits of Susan's gallery, but also the sleeping bodies of her daughter and her lover whom she calls in the middle of the night to seek motherly assurance. He also persists with the notion that, despite being absent in the real-life world of Susan in the present day, the two are still inextricably linked: when Susan bathes in the vain hope of encouraging elusive sleep, so Tom showers in a motel following his harrowing night on the cold and bleak highways of Texas' deserts. Investigating officer Bobby (Michael Shannon) himself appears to represent Edward's absent father in his novel: both offering paternal reassurance cruelly cut off by death and illness. In his role as the Texan deputy, Shannon is magnificent, tracing the slow decline from embittered and dogged investigator to vigilantist as the cancer wrecking his body determines him to ensure that his last case will not join a long list of technical loophole justice.Gyllenhall is likewise adept at tracing the picked upon and oppressed Tony into the cold-eyed avenger whose life was destroyed one fatal night. The final act of 'Nocturnal Animals' literary voyage is a masterclass in tension and suspense, finally granted the cathartic resolution that it has been screaming out for since its opening pages. But perhaps it's Adams herself who gives the most nuanced of performances, trapped in a loveless marriage and surrounded by a sumptuous yet soulless home, who comes to accept that she gave up on the man she loved from high-school and whose literary prowess has now held her capture during one long, sleepless night. For a woman who only found creativity by depicting such cold and brutal images of life's finality, the fact that Edward has himself sent her a love-letter of such violent and senseless clarity unites them despite their decades-long separation. His own 'weakness' lost both a wife and unborn child, much as Tony's inability to channel his own alpha-male authority in the face of redneck violence robbed him of a wife and daughter. Ultimately Susan is condemned to the life she chose twenty years previously, sat bereft in a restaurant in the flawed belief that Edward will join her for a re-conciliatory dinner. Of course, he never comes, giving 'Nocturnal Animals' its coda: art imitates life. And a broken marriage here has left both parties with a vacuous hole at the centre of their emotional lives.",Nocturnal Animals

Dark, violent and downright hard to watch at times (and I'm not just talking about the opening credits), Nocturnal Animals is destined to not be everyone's cup of tea.The film follows three different storylines seamlessly interwoven together. The first is the present day story of Susan an art gallery owner who despite ""having it all"" is living a deeply unfulfilling life and spends most of her nights lying awake regretting the choices she's made. After receiving a copy of her Ex-Husband Edward's novel in the mail she quickly realizes the characters and themes within are eerily similar to that of her and her Ex. The sinister and violent nature of the novel sends her into a spiral of paranoia and forces her to contemplate her own transgressions as she reads the work of a man she left broken and alone 20 years prior. The second storyline is the novel played out in her head and is a unsettling tale of abduction, murder and revenge. The novel portion is very clearly an expression of Edwards own feelings towards his Ex. But told through the lens of a grizzly murder mystery. The third part is played out in flashbacks outlining their life together and the chain of events that led to their separation.While the non linear approach to this type of storytelling is one of the films biggest strengths it also feels like it's biggest weakness as well. You're essentially watching three separate movies play out at once and none of them really feel fully realized, as right when one starts to get interesting you're jolted back into the other. Because of this none of the arcs feel fully fleshed out.While the Novel portion played out in Susan's head is by far the most gripping, each strand is an important piece of the larger story. Part drama, part mystery-thriller Nocturnal Animals is an extremely impressive sophomore effort from fashion designer turned film maker Tom Ford. It can be a little to on the nose in its symbolism at times and narrowly toes the line between artsy and pretentious. Despite this it features some truly beautiful Cinematography and gripping performances by Jake Gylenhal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson (best role of his career) who all brought their A game and make up for the handful of story elements that felt half baked.A revenge tale in more ways than one Nocturnal Animals brilliantly illustrates sometimes the best revenge is living a happy life. While the finale felt more irresolute than ambiguous, the journey is still one worth experiencing, and one I will be thinking about for many days to come.",Nocturnal Animals
488,Birajyogi,Just became my joint 1st No. 1 movie,10,24 March 2017,"I loved this movie! As much as I love Taxi Driver! A story so great, it had me at the edge of my seat from the beginning. Amy Adams receives a package and inside it is a book my her ex husband dedicated to her. As she settles down and starts reading the book a harrowing, scary, cringeworthy story starts taking shape. The great thing about this movie is that you can connect with these characters and sympathize, and hate them. Two overlapping story takes place in this movie and the director does a great job weaving it together.Jake Gyllenhal-the man who can make any movie good. Give him a good story and he will make it a earth shattering experience as he has done time and over again. I don't need to say how good he was in Nightcrawler or Prisoners or Enemy or even Southpaw. Southpaw was an average story but Jake made it a great movie. I have been a fan of this man for a long time and I have made it a habit to watch anything he does. Amy Adams is equally interesting, she carries herself well as we have come to expect that from her. She shows a vulnerability and cold hearted side of the character which makes it even more attention grabbing. Let's got the reason why I'm here....MICHAEL SHANNON-the greatest character actor to have ever graced the silver screen. I am in awe of this man, the way he makes me hate him and love him at the same time. 99 Homes, Midnight Special, Mud, Boardwalk Empire...they are just some of the greatest acted movies ever. So, Michael Shannon- thanks!Just go watch it...it's great!",Nocturnal Animals

Nocturnal Animals deserves a 10 with no doubt it has just thrilled me out for the reasons I'd mention before. The parallelism between the novel (written by Edward) and the real life during the movie is just brilliant and so is the final. I don't want to reveal anything else I just wanted to give my congrats the director (Tom Ford) and all the actors whose plays were amazing, I also would like to refer that the orchestral was beautiful too so congratulations Abel Korzeniowski.

Mid movie until the ending was very underwhelming and the ending was a total bomb, there was a lot left unexplained and it seems to me that there are better ways to get revenge on someone than simply standing them up for dinner. Michael Shannon was the only reason I watched until the end, he never disappoints although a normally very entertaining Jake Gyllenhaal fell horribly short.

The truth is that 19 years had passed, it's a lifetime! Even if he knew her that well and guessed right that she'd live to regret her choice he had no way of knowing at which point in her life she was. He didn't know about her husband's ""financial troubles"", he didn't know she knew she was being cheated on or that she was feeling empty nest syndrome. For it to be any sort of revenge he had to hurt her emotionally, just standing her up would be the equivalent of Tony telling Bobby he was fine with Ray walking away with it. Given that Tony kills Ray only to die himself I expected Edward to pull a Vicomte de Valmont, show up for dinner, chat with her, quickly realize she was ripe for being seduced and then dump her after sex with ""wow, you really *did* become your mother"" or something else really cruel and personal. You know, really drive in the dagger even if it hurt him as well and still left him empty after 19 years. For all he knows she got *annoyed* and bitched about how her loser ex- husband and his shitty novel wasted her time while she and her husband planned their upcoming scuba diving vacation in Bora Bora over the phone.I dunno... seems strangely underwhelming for something that took him 19 years to cook.",Nocturnal Animals

Nothing to that story either. Maybe you could think that's why she was eyeing her ex-husband and had to read his book. Who knows. A man who almost acts indifferent with what happens to his wife and daughter. So unrealistic. I stayed watching in the hopes that something would make sense of this horrid movie. That never happened.

505,journeyousglory,Nothing left to say after all is said and done,9,19 November 2016,"What an awful, sick, cold, and very good film this was. I am appalled at the lengths it has gone to make sure we get the message, which is indeed revenge, at it's core-- the storehouse awaiting those who trample upon the sanctity and purity of... raw love? One is left at gunpoint, forced to ask if it is even legal to question, to walk out on a heart that is bleeding... do any means justify an end? The message of this film is a resounding, unforgiving ""No.""The main protagonist of the film, a privileged and worldly artist (Susan) struggling with the life of a self-professed ""realist and pragmatic""- who has trampled upon the allure and purity of idealistic hopes instead opting for her now unhappy partnership with someone who thinks the same way she does: with a bent towards callous cynicism, in her world of elitist, high-class art.In the midst of her blatant unhappiness a manuscript from her ex-husband of a few, passion-fueled years surfaces as a neatly wrapped package in the mail. Dedicated ""To Susan"" and in it a violent depiction of a man's world, everything he loves and holds dear, snatched out from under him, and who bears an uncanny resemblance to the writer. What other resemblances, what other metaphors in this violent, cruelly honest portrait of the past, of the now present?This film left me reeling, angry, and a witness to something horrific. But it was stunning, and I have nothing left to say.",Nocturnal Animals
506,j-p-porter,"Good Movie, Poor Book Adaptation (some spoilers)",7,22 March 2017,"This is a good movie - suspenseful and effective. It is also based on a book that is extremely good - Tony and Susan. Unfortunately, there are a couple of changes made in the film that make the meaning of the book obscure. Also, there are some elements that - I guess - would be attributable to director/screenwriter Tom Ford, who should, perhaps, stick to fashion design. Both the movie and the book are really stories within stories - the book pulls this off most effectively, Ford pulls it off very poorly, mainly because of a wrong-headed casting choice.The main story is about Susan Morrow (Adams), who owns an art gallery. Her husband Hutton (Hammer) is a businessman who travels a great deal (and appears to be cheating on Susan). This is Susan's second marriage, her first one being to Edward Sheffield, an aspiring writer Susan ultimately loses faith in; she begins an affair with Hutton, whom she marries after divorcing Edward.Many years after their divorce, Edward sends Susan a copy of a manuscript, Nocturnal Animals, that is about to be published - Edward wants Susan to read the book. This is where the story within a story takes place. The book is about English Professor Tony Hastings, who is on vacation with his wife and teenage daughter. His wife and daughter are kidnapped right in front of him, and he is driven to an isolated location where he is expected to be killed. He manages to escape, however, is able to contact police, and the search for the kidnappers and Tony's family is begun.{Possible SPOILERS begin here}The point of the (real) book was that Susan and the character Tony are alike in that they have no self respect. Susan leaves the man she loves to marry someone who ultimately has no love for her and basically abandons her - and she accepts that. Tony stands by while he, his wife and daughter are terrorized, and basically allows the ruffians to kidnap his family while he lets it happen. Ford blows the Susan-Tony connection by casting Jake Gyllenhaal as both Edward Sheffield and Tony Hastings. Totally inadequate on two counts: we're never sure when we are watching Edward and when we are watching Tony; using Gyllenhaal in the two roles causes a disconnect between the Tony character and Susan.The roles are structured wrongly. Tony in the film fights to stop the kidnapping, while in the book he simply lets it happen. Susan in the book knows what is going on around her, and knows that no one has an inkling of respect for her, but she allows that - while the film Susan is more like a totally clueless person who is simply ineffectual.Ford does try to identify (lack of) self-respect as the theme in the opening sequence of the film, which involves grossly obese nude women dancing, but a sense of disgust overwhelms the effort.I place full blame for the inadequacies in this film on Tom Ford. Gyllenhaal, Adams, and the rest of the cast (especially Michael Shannon as the dying sheriff Bobby Andes) give very serviceable performances. They are all let down, however, by a mediocre vision of how to translate a complex book into a 2-hour movie.",Nocturnal Animals

Like his first film A Single Man (2009), He delivers a powerful film that will leave the viewer at the edge of your seat. At times during the film i was so impressed on how he made me feel the pain for Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon deliver tier 1 performances!

510,douglasellice,Makes me want to read the source book,4,7 August 2017,"This review contains spoilers. I didn't much like this movie. I was really bothered by at least two choices the director made. I disliked the irrelevant and gratuitous opening scenes of naked fat women. Reminded me of the hatefulness and misogyny of a circus side show. What was the artistic point? I also thought that casting the same actor to play two roles was childish. Was director Ford afraid that we wouldn't see the that the novelist Edward had a main character in his book (Tony) to whom he related deeply? (A minor complaint of mine was the paper cut, telegraphing to us that this package was going to really, really hurt Susan.)I'm a rabid Michael Mann fan, and I did very much enjoy the stylish city lights at night shots.I did enjoy the story within a story - Edward's novel. Every man I know can relate to the self-loathing that would come from being unable to protect one's family from more-primitive males. Straw Dogs, anyone? Neither did I think the crimes in Edward's novel were far-fetched. Road rage nightmares have become too common in our real lives, and women are sexually assaulted all the time. I might have gotten the central point sooner if I knew Edward had learned of Susan's abortion. (He must have, right? And yet we didn't see that, right? Or did I miss that?) Anyway, his fictional hero loses his wife and child, and Edward reminds Susan that he, too lost a wife and child - by her actions. I (finally) didn't like the ending, either. Seems trivial to invite Susan to dinner and then not show up. Edward has already ""gotten even"" with Susan by writing the novel. That dinner table scene was purely for our benefit, to make sure we hadn't missed the point that Edward was settling scores.",Nocturnal Animals

512,Glassgrl,"All gloss, No substance",2,22 August 2017,"I chose to watch this movie because it received decent reviews and was advertised as a taut psychological thriller. Sadly, the only emotions it managed to summon were frustration and disappointment.Pros: The cinematography is lovely. Michael Shannon is very strong in a role that ends up going nowhere and is inconsequential to the ""resolution"" of either the main or secondary story.Cons: The story thread that is meant to be the main plot goes absolutely nowhere. I am personally of the opinion that Amy Adams is a competent actress who is nowhere near as strong as the accolades she has received suggest, however she is better than this movie. She is given little to do other than look numb and/or sad. Oh, and spend a good deal of time in or under water, which is either symbolic that she is drowning in her life or that we are drowning in pretension. Her character is so unlikable that you spend most of the movie hoping that this drudgery is at least leading up to some wicked revenge or plot twist. It isn't. I won't give away the ending, but it is not even remotely satisfying.Jena Malone is also wasted in a one-scene role where her sole purpose appears to be to wear something edgy and to point out that the main character is so numb and stupid that she doesn't remember what paintings she purchased (in some very obvious foreshadowing, a painting of the word REVENGE.The ""art"" in the movie is eye-rolling and I'm not sure what the director was trying to achieve with most of it.

The story then breaks down into 3 sub-plots between current time, her past with her former husband, and the time within the manuscript she was reading. The only redeeming value of the whole movie was the plot when she was reading the story - we all like hearing a good story right? But it stops with that being the only part that was any good. The movie drags in many spots. Very little time to show much if any of Amy Adams' usually good acting ability.

We just started laughing and said, ""Is that it? Really?""SPOILER:

515,davidcassels,The first half hour of this film is the best piece of cinema I have seen all year.,8,30 December 2016,"The first half hour of this film is the best piece of cinema I have seen all year. This first half hour is clever, it's intriguing, it's terrifying and it's sad. Ford successfully takes the audience on a ride unlike any other it recent history. Unfortunately the nest half hour to this movie slows way down to a crushing halt.This second quarter is painfully slow and I cannot imagine how boring it would have been if the first half hour hadn't been so exhilarated. Whether helped or hurt by the exciting intro, this second act takes on unnecessary baggage and just lasts forever. Luckily, at almost exactly the halfway point this movie kicks back into gear and continues strong till the end.Reading through others reviews, it's clear to see that this movie had got some mixed reviews. While I often find hope in mixed review movies because I believe that they prove that a movie is challenging and effected different people on different levels (this idea is proved in movies like the fountain, requiem for a dream, or life is beautiful). While this movie is challenging and meaningful, more importantly is that it is unique. There are very few films which are like Nocturnal Animals. For this reason it causes a divide between cinephiles and average viewers. If you do not watch many movies than Nocturnal Animals will likely blow you away, but if you are well acquainted with the likes of The Fountain or Mr. Nobody than don't expect too much.At the end of the day the real gem to be found in this movie is thinking about it after you've seen it. Beginning to tie different metaphors together into one theme is extremely satisfying. Ultimately I chose to give this film an 8 for a couple of reasons: It's a solid film which has more going on behind which you think about afterwards. It is good movie, but it would not be as good of a film if it was not so original. I want to see more intelligent movies like this and as Nocturnal Animals is already a good movie I did not see the harm in boosting the score up a little bit just to encourage producers to make more intelligent films.",Nocturnal Animals

It was painful, tiresome and somewhat hideous to sit through. It felt like a very poor nod to David Lynch, and the theme of despair and lack of redemption didn't add to it's lack of charm.I read a review on the Odeon site which summed it up for me, so my review will loosely echo a guy on that site. The film starts how it means to go on - it assaults your senses in a really unpleasant way. There is nothing new or clever about this film; it's an exercise in bleakness, despair and much hand-wringing and naval-gazing by the main protagonist, Susan. Lest there is any doubt in the mind of the viewer about the theme towards the end, an art piece that spells 'revenge' is given a bit of air time and another angsty scene is written around it.It's nothing but an empty, dark little exercise in despair, thinking itself more clever than it actually is.

519,brandtreview,Visually stunning but vapid in narrative,3,2 September 2017,"I want to start this review by stating that, yes, I understand that this film was meant to be deep and symbolic of the contempt that Gyllenhaal felt for Adams' character, and I will concede that, visually speaking, this film is beautiful and something to be studied and appreciated. However, the visual aesthetic of this film cannot make up for its lackluster narrative.Perhaps its the unexplained lack of sleep our lead is suffering from, but given her performance as her younger self, I find Adams' character as a whole bland, emotionless, and unapproachable. She denies being better than others, but gives off an air of superiority. Example, she pushes Gyllenhaal away until he finally lives up to her standards. This is not a likable character. Despite her crumbling relationship with Hammer's character, and her insistence that she cares for him, I find every aspect of her character insincere. Not to mention that he willingly entered into an affair with a married woman, and she's shocked that he would cheat on her in much the same way. Gyllenhaal,on the other, gives a great performance, both as her husband and as the father in his story. I think he did a great job with the material that he was given and really shines in terms of this movie. That being said, the scene in which he blows up at Adams' character for not liking the few pages he gave her to read mars his final revenge as petty instead of righteous. He handed it to her for her opinion, and threw a tantrum when she didn't respond the way he thought she ought to have... So I guess I should say that he gave it to her so she could give him HIS opinion. This is made even more ridiculous by the fact that her advice was that he not write about himself, and the book he uses to attract her wasn't really about himself.They also set up his character as being really sensitive and accepting, but he's SHOCKED when he finds out she aborted a baby she didn't want without his permission. This scars the fabric of his backstory, by creating problems out of something he had no control over. He couldn't tell her no, even if she had told him. She had told him their relationship wasn't working, and that she wasn't happy with him. Why is he so shocked? She was going to leave him anyway. Why would she, a liberal woman who hates all aspects of what her parents stand for, keep the baby? Her actions don't call for his response.Finally, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson give great performances. Aaron Taylor Johnson was legitimately threatening throughout this film, and was genuinely unlikable throughout. Michael Shannon was absolutely stunning in his part, hitting all the marks; intimidating, passionate, understanding, you name it. It's funny that it should be the secondary characters in a film like this who really shine.I've heard some people complain about the opening credit sequence. As a woman, I didn't really find it offensive, or shocking, or 'blinding' as I heard one critic describe it. I agree that it wasn't necessary, but again, Tom Ford is all about style, and in today's film market, shocking=good. I wasn't shocked, I wasn't moved; it was just one more way for Ford to appeal to the 'style crowd' to distract from the shortcomings of the narrative.I'm giving this film a 3/10. If it weren't for the excellent performances by Gyllenhaal, Shannon, and Johnson, it would be a 1/10. This movie wasn't made for me. I do think this movie probably has an audience that will appreciate it as art, but the narrative didn't sell me, and, in the end, I was disappointed by the final product.",Nocturnal Animals

2) on the second level, a crime takes place and someone takes revenge. there is no depth to the characters with a single exception. the scenario doesn't make sense, nobody would act like the characters did here. they simply cannot exist in the real world as they are portrayed in the movie.

Urgh, it's like watching a vengeful teenager play out their romantic issues on screen in a really clunky way so that the viewer walks away thinking ""well that was a load of old blather""
What was the point of it? The moral being that the art/fashion world is vapid isn't enough of a statement. Not the way this was done at least.
The fact that the very people the film is biting its thumb at are the very same people to give it rewards and great reviews just says it all for me.
It was like the filmmaker realised their tale of vengeance wasn't enough to make a whole film so added this pretentious other layer in an attempt to look more clever than they are.
So in conclusion, vastly overrated and disappointing.",Nocturnal Animals
522,meh3587,Really well done. Haven't seen a movie this good in a long time.,8,22 February 2017,"I have read many reviews of this movie and I believe they all entirely miss the mark. This movie isn't about revenge at all. It is about the nature of male/female relationships at this current time. The dancing figures at the beginning are majorette/fertility goddesses. They are all representations of the universal woman and the artist, Susan. ""All women turn into their mothers."" Susan appears sitting on a slab in a green dress, the current incarnation of the fertility goddess herself. The dancing/dead women are there to represent the life cycle: birth, death, rebirth. But the dancing goddesses/majorettes are depicted as old because the male/female relationship is played out and no longer fertile. The men in the story, every single one of them including the killers, are weak and lost without female boosterism and direction. The first husband, Edward, demonstrates that he at least realizes this because it is the theme of his novel. The murderer states that he only does what women accuse him of doing. The sheriff disappears after he kills the first murderer leaving ""weak"" husband Tony alone. And Tony, in true bungler fashion, ends up killing himself. They are all lost and incompetent.The sign ""revenge"" alludes to women taking their revenge on men, other women and themselves by assuming the typical male role in the boardroom and elsewhere in frustration over their disappointment in men. Note the sterility of the environment, the dominatrix female, and the all-female staff. In death, as in life, women (the mother and daughter in an eternal embrace, the women on the slabs) have only themselves to count on, to love. They are alone. The men in their lives have faded away due to their own idiocy, evilness, and weakness. That is why Amy sits alone, in yet another incarnation, in her green dress, reborn at the moment that her first husband died because she believed that his insight might mean that he had changed. His fictional death might be the acceptable sacrifice to the goddess. But just as every single other male character, even those alluded to, could not really connect with women or be relied upon, Edward remained the ever disappointing male. I could say a lot more about the movie's meaning but know it isn't about revenge. It's about the nature of men and women and their relationship. And Amy is an artist. It is her own performance art which is being depicted at the beginning. She is not just the curator at an art gallery. It's important to know.",Nocturnal Animals

Given the 'novel' idea, that might have been excused, but all the dialog in the supposed 'real world' was just as bad. The only actor able to shine through this pretentious crap was Michael Shannon, but after a time his character just disappeared from the story. And what was Michael Sheen doing in this movie? And the nude fat dancers? It really added up to nothing. And oh my goodness, what a payback for leaving a man and aborting his child: He got her to go to a dinner meeting AND DIDN'T SHOW UP! Wow!

526,fdiallo33,"Intriguing, but a bit disappointing.",6,5 October 2017,"We've all had that book that we were addicted to. We read it every chance we could. Further into reading some of us even compared ourselves to the main character. Picturing ourselves as him/her and eventually may even find similarities to them. ""Nocturnal Animals"" was Susan's book.This film follows a woman named Susan who receives a book from her ex-husband. One element of the film follows the main character in the book, Tony and how tragedy strikes his family. The other element of the film follows Susan and her journey.The editing, cinematography and writing was pretty good. The viewer can feel the different and sometimes similar tones from Susan's life compared to Tony's life. The viewer can also understand the different emotions the characters were going through. The acting was spot on.Now I'd like to discuss what I think could have been improved in this movie. The screenplay is based on a novel by Austin Wright. I haven't read it so I cannot compare. I can say, to me, I felt like I was just watching them. I didn't connect with them. During the whole movie, my heart didn't race, not once. I feel the writers could have spent more time establishing ways the viewer could relate to the main characters. I also understood the concepts the themes displayed but I feel they could have been executed better.Overall the film is okay. At the end of the film I just felt, is this it? I wouldn't watch it again.",Nocturnal Animals

I was really expecting a good and entertaining film. Nevertheless, the film was tedious and uninteresting. I remember I watched a film with the same plot as Edward's ""great"" book. Tom Ford should have been a little bit more original with the script. What a disappointment when you feel you're watching a remake from a bad crime and repetitive movie. Or maybe I was expecting something as good as Mulholland Drive (2001) or Persona (1966), given the score so high of this film. On the other hand, the movie was well acted and directed. The lead actors were excellent. The make up was good.

531,bardnoir-810-404602,If you're read the synopsis you've seen the movie,3,22 July 2021,"The synopsis of this film IS the film. The movie itself doesn't develop the characters any further. It doesn't expand on what you learn form reading the synopsis and it never really bothers to answer any questions or resolve anything.This movie spends so much time telling two stories at once it doesn't have time to develop anything.The first story is the woman reading her ex-husbands manuscript and reflecting on the failures in their relationship. The second is the story the woman is reading. From time to time we cut to her reaction to the story so that we don't have to react to it.Yet, neither of these stories really land anywhere. The book is the first problem, as it only servers to make the woman think about the past relationship. Because we know it's just his book there are no stakes for the character. It's like knowing the whole thing is a simulation so what's happening to the characters doesn't really matter. It's not ""real"" in a story that's also not real.Am I really supposed to be invested in a fake character written by a fake character? How much suspension of belief am I supposed to have?Next is the story of the woman. We get hints of things that may or may not be indicators of a problem in her current marriage. But, again, this doesn't go anywhere. We're never told if she IS feeling this way or if these feelings are justified. In the end we don't know if she's realized the errors of her ways and wants to go back to her ex-husband if she going to apologies for the things that were her fault in the marriage.Some would say ""the ending is open to interpretation"" while I say ""the movie just wasn't smart enough to have an ending"" - I hardly thing it has much of a middle. This whole thing feels like the set up for the REAL story. I'd rather see the movie where she meets up with her ex-husband after being moved by the book he read because she had no faith in him and now needs to decide if she's going to stay in her current marriage which may also be failing or go back to the man she broke the heart of.Where is THAT movie?",Nocturnal Animals

But seriously - it is very pretentious and it doesn't live up to whatever artsy intentions it set for itself. It's just a bunch of clichés wrapped in a visually appealing - ma non troppo - form. What bothered me most is the artificial build-up of suspense when Susan suddenly gasps and loses breath while reading the novel. She isn't reading any Stephen King, nor is she reaching some highly intense points where the novel twists and turns. No, she is just reading some sort of a western story that's emotionally very dry. There is no real connection with any of the characters in the two parallel stories, at the end I really couldn't care less if they all lived or died in pain. No emotional build-up whatsoever.

534,vicentesobral,"Stylish, superbly-crafted thriller",9,15 November 2016,"I had the privilege of seeing this in the LEFF Closing Ceremony, and this great movie caught my attention right from its opening credits. One of the most important things in a psychological thriller like this one is the soundtrack, and Korzeniowski surprised me with his great classical melody, filled with romantic ideas. Other important part is the cinematography, and this one is superb. From a director who's also a fashion designer, I wouldn't expect less in the visuals, very close from Nicholas Winding Refn through its colors and macabre stuff. The acting is good, but, honestly, Jake and Amy Adams are already awarded actors. Their roles are, as well as Shannon's, filled with dramatic tension, and they are up to the job. Finally, the script is good, and the articulation of the different settings (Texas roads, modern art-house) and story lines makes me remember Sergio Leone. A great thriller, filled with suspense and tension.",Nocturnal Animals
535,neyenna,Tom Ford is a genius,9,11 January 2017,"This visually stunning masterpiece tells the story of writer Edward and his ex-wife Susan. Long after their breakup, when she's already remarried, he sends her his latest manuscript. She gets overwhelmed by the story, which is not surprising, since the book is hauntingly gruesome.And so, we see two main story lines unfold - Susan's life and the plot of the book. Interestingly enough, we never see ""present day""- Edward, we only see him in flashbacks and as his character, Tony.I went to see this movie only because Tom Ford made it - and that reason was good enough; I was not disappointed in the slightest.The whole thing starts of with a sort of grotesque art exhibition consisting of overweight women flapping their bare, excessive skin on screen. In their knee-high, white hooker shoes they seem to be dancing to a different song than the audience hears but it's quite an interesting look. What was most striking to me was the honesty of the visual; the women weren't edited. They just flapped their flaps as they were and they weren't at all terrible to look at.Tom Ford shows physicality in general in a very peculiar way. In any scene with naked bodies in this movie they seem unedited and in the case of Susan and her daughter India, their bodies are just terrific. Which is weird because we see them naked only when they're dead.The bodies are nothing compared to the landscape images though. It's worth seeing Nocturnal Animals for the incredible landscape shots alone. Especially the clouds, the desert, the rich colours, everything.The shots in general were quite unique. Wide shots, with little movement, or movement of the actors that wasn't front and center. Or really tight close-ups, which reminded me of the 40's for some reason. Then, suddenly quick shots, matched to the speed of a beating heart.Tom Ford is a genius.Oh well, there was one unnecessary, unexplained jump scare that I would've just edited out but that's fine.Another thing I really liked about the design of the film was how the jumps in time were introduced - because they weren't. The images just naturally shaped into either present day, book time and flashbacks. There was no need for superimposed text that would inform us that we went back in time.One major thing I didn't enjoy though (but this might be a thing I don't enjoy in general in movies) was the open ending. Susan and Edward were supposed to meet and he didn't show. Even though he insisted on the meeting! Was this just some weak revenge? Or did he show up in the end? Or did he kill himself? Or what's going on there? I know some people like leaving the cinema thinking what would happen next but I guess I'm not one of them.But all is forgiven thanks to one scene in the movie. Basically, young Susan and Edward are on a spontaneous date. Edward is clean- shaven, sharply dressed and Susan looks dreamy in her side-swept hair and undeniably perfect face. The best thing about this scene in my view is Jake Gyllenhaal's acting. He dominated that scene. And man, was he charming. I mean, literally, charming, fall-on-your- knees-in-love-charming. I couldn't believe my eyes. I think he's a great actor but I didn't know he could pull something like this off. I think even if somebody didn't like him they would be just as floored as me by his performance. It was the epitome of what mainstream pop culture presents as romantic.In conclusion, this is a strong, incredibly well-designed movie, definitely worth seeing, even if the plot itself isn't your thing. There are some flaws in my view but as a whole it's quite terrific. I hope Tom Ford will keep up his unique style of creating art in movie form.",Nocturnal Animals

I was really excited to see this movie - I live in France now and there are a limited number of movies in English at the local theater, so I drove an hour to the larger theater to see it. What a waste of four hours!I did understand the point the movie was trying to make, I just didn't feel like it made the point well. Judging by the very loud expressions of disgust at the end of the movie, many of the French felt the same way.Having a ""book within a movie"" is an interesting concept, but that portion of the movie was a made-for-TV quality movie at best.

537,nmradiance,Awful Film,2,9 December 2016,"This film basically consisted of a bunch of guys waving guns at each other without knowing how to use them properly (including the sheriff) which isn't a surprise coming from an artsy director who has probably never held a gun in his life. Not that there's anything wrong with being artsy but sometimes you lose pragmatism for the sake of style. The protagonist (Jake Gynelhall's character) is so much of a wimp when it comes to protecting his family, it's hard to relate to him. Amy Adam's story consists of her whimsically lying around, reading this novel, and reminiscing over a past romance while questioning her current one. There's two stories happening simultaneously, which could be interesting if somehow tied together, but all the director gives us are clever screen transitions. I much preferred ""The Neon Demon"" if you're looking for a glimpse into Los Angeles' art-world elite. It's darker and even more twisted.",Nocturnal Animals

I could even give this a one word review but IMDb need 10 lines and that one word may be deemed offensive to some readers.This... film... is more like a poor, over-budgeted tele-drama. But I guess it makes a lot of sense, as the film actually looks like it was made by a fashion designer; it is highly stylised, even slick but totally lacking in substance. The exchange of dialogue, meaning and any chemistry between characters of the more than capable cast (I really dig Jake Gyllenhall) was slaughtered by what appeared to be the director's obsession controlling each and every frame, resulting in jerky and awkward delivery.Also, this film ain't no thriller. There's even a cheap stunt employed that only the most b-grade non-thrillers pull: the quick flash of a scary image that's out of place to scare the bejesus out of you. Ridiculous.Apart from the annoying directorial anal retentiveness rendering the actor's performance insincere, the story is just so totally and utterly implausible and leaves you feeling empty.

I think the major takeaway is that Edward vicariously lives through his fictional character Tony; who demonstrates the strength that he has been accused of lacking from Susan and all the other characters in the film he had a connection with (Susan's Mom, her current husband etc).Also let's dissect the title of the film and the title of the manuscript. ""Nocturnal Animals"" was an ode to Susan. Throughout the film she showcases classic signs of insomnia. Looking at the events in the manuscript one can ask why did Edward/Tony drive his family in the middle of nowhere in the night time, that seems a bit odd. In a way it seems both Edward and Susan are nocturnal animals. The nighttime is their escape from the harsh realities of the world and the underwhelming feelings that reside.The film has so many interpretations that it can have the viewer confused.

There are so many details, especially some regarding the story told within the novel, that add so much to the overall story and it's a blast attempting to analyze them. If you're willing to pay attention and put a bit of effort into it, this film's enjoyment greatly increases upon analysis.The performances are all excellent, in particular Aaron Taylor Johnson and Michael Shannon (who, while I'm on the subject, is a national treasure and I don't think enough people appreciate him.) The scenes that take place within the novel are some of the most uncomfortably riveting things I've ever seen. A bit of a disclaimer though: don't go into this film expecting a generic thriller.

For those of you who think that I didn't understand the inner turmoil of the writer pictured there as a physical struggle.. let me put your mind at ease. I did and so should everyone, because this movie is a like a fake easy test you get just to feel good about yourself. No thanks. After twenty years this is his revenge? Showing her that he wrote a crap book? Making her feel alone, left behind, like he felt back then? Making her understand what he has been through, what she missed? Big whoop, she already knew and beside hurting a bit she didn't do anything about it. You know, like in real life. Tom Ford, master of the cinema verite.I have a fun fact for you: did you know that when Ray is sitting on the toilet outside, and the cop tells him to get dressed, he wipes his ass with a page of the script? True story.Joking aside, there is so much ""The emperor's new clothes"" thing going on in the movie business nowadays that my head hurts.Anyway, trashing this flick is the only thing that makes me feel better after losing 4 bucks to this writer , director , fashion designer, lion tamer, electrician, etc, so I'm sorry if I upset anybody who was deeply moved by his movie, and will forever remember it as one of great pieces of cinema.In all honesty, there are so many movies more deserving of good reviews, and it is sad that we don't have smarter critics.",Nocturnal Animals
556,pmurph7,Not much to like,3,24 November 2017,The actors did a decent job but this is a poor script with characters that don't elicit any sympathy. The ending is pathetic in its lack of resolution and leaves you feeling robbed of the time you spent watching it. Amy Adams' character has a momentary glimpse of humanity in one of the story lines but quickly betrays all morality. Gyllenhaal's character should be filled with righteous fury and vengeance but instead is just an impotent coward who never delivers on what he deserves to mete out. Michael Shannon plays the only character that anyone could respect. There is a weird quirk where in the cross between what's portrayed as the real arch of Adams' and Gyllenhaal's true relationship there was a daughter but it is so brief and poorly addressed I can't begin to guess if it was meant to be real or if it was just a device meant for the book that occupied more than half of the movie. It's a confusing and stupid movie that makes good actors look foolish for appearing in it.,Nocturnal Animals
557,thajudheen,"A lot of flash, but very little substance.",6,31 March 2019,"Nocturnal Animals was watchable, but it was not quite as clever as it presented itself to be. The positives of the movie were that the story-within-a-story mechanism was interesting, it was beautifully shot, the actors delivered great performances, and it was presented as a stylish, polished overall package. But in spite of all of these positives, I still felt that the movie had nothing to offer beneath the surface. The inner story was supposed to be a symbolic representation of the destruction that had occurred in Susan's past. The grimy thriller approach to showing that destruction was indeed effective, and I wondered if that could have made a better movie on its own. The escalating sequence between the family and the men at the beginning of the story was gripping and terrifying. On the other hand, the sexual violence involved in this story (and how it was shown & described) made me extremely uncomfortable, and I was seriously considering an exit at that point.The connections made between these two stories were also too obvious. As the story unfolds, you get this mapping of how the events in the first story connect to the events in the second story. The pacing of both stories was such that this happened side-by-side, so there was really no sense of mystery involved in this process. While this was happening, I also felt that I did not care much about Susan as a character. The only characterization I had on her was that she had made regrettable choices, and that she ruminated on those problem in her monstrosity of a home. I wanted to see where her story would go, but ended up feeling blank when it eventually ended. I did not feel that the ending was ambiguous in any way, simply because the movie included a scene around a painting that quite literally spelled out 'REVENGE' in obscenely large letters.To summarize, I thought that Nocturnal Animals was a movie with a lot of flash and very little substance. When a movie has ended and you still don't care about the main character, it's hard to rate it as being 'good'.",Nocturnal Animals

From the Lynchian opening, to the suspenseful, incredibly crafted, almost Hitcockian, action scenes and the evocative colour palette, my eyes were glued to the screen. Shannon and Gyllenhaal are amazing, but Adams manages to instill in the audience a sense of restlessness which few could've pulled off. It's amazing how absolutely nothing feels out of place, as if Ford was looming behind every shot, every word and every gesture.",Nocturnal Animals
559,yelmer_motmans,Beautifully directed movie with an interesting frame story,9,29 July 2018,"'Nocturnal Animals' is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2016. Tom Ford did an impeccable job combining the exquisite soundtrack (kudos for Abel Korzeniowski) with the beautiful scenery. I am looking forward to seeing more of Ford's future work, as he seems to be not only a talented fashion designer but also has a critical eye for detail and artistic direction within his movies. As for the acting, Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal never fail to impress me. Nocturnal Animals is another proof of how capable they are to capture the audience's attention, even with the simplest facial expression. 
Another revelation in this movie is Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Having heard little about the actor, I was mesmerized with his interpretation of the story's main villain and genuinely hated him. Taylor-Johnson was perfectly cast in this role. 
Michael Shannon's powerful performance is another great addition to the movie. The acting might be the strongest part of the movie. Nocturnal Animals contains three main narratives - the story of Edward's book, Edward's and Susan's past relationship and Susan in the the present - We watch the whole movie through the eyes of Amy Adams's character, Susan. And Adams is capable enough to keep the viewers interested until the end of the movie. The storyline of Edward's book is the most emotional and captivating one and in comparison Susan's present storyline might initially start to bore the audience a bit. But the ending of the movie brings everything masterfully together and leaves us behind with many questions. 'Nocturnal Animals' is a movie that you should watch twice. As there are so many details and clever references that you might have missed during the first watching session. The wonderful soundtrack is another reason to watch the movie a second time.Nocturnal Animals is a must see for viewers who like to watch an engaging, well build up psychological thriller. Especially for fans of both Adams and Gyllenhaal this one should not be missed.

560,hvedekimdanseren,A polished turd with few redeeming qualities...,4,9 January 2017,"(Spoiler Free Review)This film was a huge disappointment.The only redeeming qualities were the trademark (at times) stunning visuals that Tom Ford is capable of. Credit where it's due, because the use of color and composition in most scenes, as well as most of the intense acting, were worthy of a much better film. Unfortunately, the film falls completely flat due to a boring, two- dimensional story with cardboard characters and mostly comically bad dialogue.While the film operates with a story within a story, the hilariously bad plot and over the top dialogue of both stories make this film the definition of ""a polished turd"". Yes, it may be nice to look at, but ultimately the visuals and mostly intense acting has only little effect on the viewer, because of the two boring and predictable plots (the story and the story within the actual story).Even worse, the director seems undecided on whether the film is supposed to be a drama, a thriller or just a mildly dark comedy: Scenes that are supposed to be intense fall mostly flat because of the absurdity of both the characters' actions as well as the ridiculous dialogue. While the movie does start with a few intense and welldirected scenes, the following scenes quickly become not just unnatural - they are pretty much B-movie standard with no depth at all. ""Less is more"" is quickly thrown away by the director and replaced with pieces of dialogue explaining everything to the viewer. Furthermore, scenes of supposed drama become nonsensical due to unnatural human behavior and weirdly convenient coincidences. Even further, at times small scenes seem to be just suddenly ""thrown into"" the film for no apparent reason than a visual peculiarity or a mildly funny joke. Overall, it is a film quite obviously created by a fashion designer: At times both actors' emotions and visuals reach striking heights, but everything falls flat due to a nonsensical story (and the almost as nonsensical story within that story) resulting in the viewer being left chuckling at the absurd lines, nonsensical plot and randomly included scenes. Avoid this at the cinema at all costs. Go to an art gallery in stead. The latter will have more depth than this posh and snobby excuse of a film...",Nocturnal Animals

563,llcohee,A modern curse tragedy.,9,2 December 2016,"Nocturnal Animals, Tom Ford's film adaptation of Austin Wright's novel Tony and Susan, is a curse tale, a story of vengeful justice, its three overlapping plots each presented in disjointed narrative style. In the present-time shell plot, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), married to handsome alpha specimen Hutton (Armie Hammer), is the principal of a glossy Los Angeles art gallery. Their superficiality is ably demonstrated by a Jeff Koons Balloon Dog on the grounds of their fabulous home high above the glittering city. But their life is on the precipice of ruin, their marriage accursed, as meaningless as her so-called art. Hutton is having an affair and is going broke, Susan medicates herself for emptiness, pain, and insomnia.She returns home late one night from a gala showing of Venus of Willendorf burlesque dancers, both in gigantic video and as grotesque odalisques. She drives through the slick metal gate of their estate. After it closes we see a black Mercedes pull up to the gate and stop. The next morning a package arrives for her containing a manuscript, a novel written by her loser English teacher first husband, Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal), whom she had left twenty years earlier for Hutton. He has titled the work after a teasing nickname he once gave Susan, ""nocturnal animal,"" and has dedicated it to her. And he has added a personal note: Would she like to meet? he will soon be in LA. In bed at night, in her husband's adulterous absence, Susan begins to read the novel. Now begins the slow deliverance of justice. Edward's book, the story-within-a-story second plot, is in the tradition of Cape Fear, Straw Dogs, Death Wish, and, at least in terrain and tone, No Country for Old Men. Mild-mannered Tony Hastings (Gyllenhaal in a double role), his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their bratty teen-aged daughter India (Ellie Bamber) pack up their Mercedes sedan for a long night-time road trip across West Texas. They are a happy family, teasing and affectionate, the kind of family Edward and Susan might have had. But on a dark and desolate two-lane they are terrorized by three evildoers who run them off the road, humiliate Tony, abduct Laura and India in his own car, and dump him far out on the desert. In this horrific scene and its consequences we witness Tony's failure of manliness. This of course must be resolved. Justice must be realized.This point links us to the third plot, the past. Obsessively reading Edward's manuscript arouses Susan's deepest guilt. Through flashbacks of their courtship and short-lived marriage we see her troubling memories. Susan was at first drawn to his romanticism and sensitivity. Her harridan mother (Laura Linney) mocks these very qualities, exhorting Susan to be a realist, predicting that if she marries Edward she will before long hate what she now most admires in him. Sure enough, daughter soon becomes her mother, criticizing his writing, berating his deficiencies, declaring herself now a realist, too, who demands more from life. Edward gets it: like her mother, she thinks he's weak. We glimpse a flirtation with Hutton, then watch the painful breakup. The abandonment of her marriage, the whiff of adultery, are bad enough. But the original sin, the moral pollution, is Susan's abortion of her and Edward's child, of which he is ignorant. Her gay brother Cooper (Neil Jackson) has engineered this evil. In his car outside the clinic, the rain-spattered windshield reflecting Susan's lamentation, she wails ""What have I done? I will really regret this someday."" Truer than she can even imagine. In one searing tragic instant Susan tells Cooper that he always knows the right thing to do and commits her trust to him. He promises her that Edward will never find out. But we suspect his motive. And Edward does know.As she reads, obsessively, Susan finally understands Edward's real strength, ability, and yes, his realism. Drawn to him now, she arranges a dinner meeting while her husband is across the country in a hotel with a lover. Does she seek to end her curse by reunion? To ask forgiveness and heal her hurt, to fill the hollowness of her life? But she doesn't understand until the final scene that Edward has seduced her by his fiction. Teasing her with the promise of a liaison, he has forced her to confront her infidelity, her weakness. She has been the one feeding on airy fantasies. She is now as achingly alone as he is. The final scene of the novel forces her and us into grim thoughts about the state of Edward's life. As curse tragedy, Nocturnal Animals is pretty damned good. Here are decent people who make terrible mistakes. We pity but cannot help them. Whether or not it is a commentary on marriage, divorce, abortion, and family, I leave to others to say. But the tight control of such a complex of plots is evident throughout. Subtle recurrent motifs stitch the three stories together. Odalisques -- ugly, macabre, or beautiful -- have been mentioned. Watch for red sofas. Baths, showers, and rain tell of vain attempts to wash what can't be cleaned.",Nocturnal Animals

And as for the story, a film within a film? More like cutting back and forth but the connection is unnecessary, overused, blurred and contrived. Some parts lack plausibility, like him driving the cop everywhere. Don't they have police cars in West Texas? The pretentious arty types, so stereotypical.

You can see clearly the metaphors Edward uses to bring on paper the hurt that he endured from his break-up. The assassination of Tony's wife and daughter symbolizes the abortion and the betrayal of Susan.The Sheriff's cancer nakes him face the facts without the fear of consequencess. He sets his life towards bringing justice in order to find his peace. It is very symbolical considering that he is a man living alone, alienated from his daughter, pretty much caught up in work, until his life is on the line and he realises that hardly any rapists and vandals like Ray face the consequences of their crimes.In Susan we see every woman fighting to escape being her mother, we see how artists grow cynical when they are not in peace with themselves and how insecurities considering her social profile and evolution get the best of her.Tony is the eternal romantic artist.

It didn't make sense and quite honestly, I didn't care for any of the characters. They were a bunch of annoying white rich people with no relatable problems. I think that the only reason Tom Ford got all these A-List actors to be in his movie is 'cos he knows them from his fashion designer days.

Maybe it's just the source material. Maybe it's Ford. Maybe it's the casting.With that said, Nocturnal Animals is glossy and gorgeous but existing without the slightest pulse. Usually I'd reserve that for the worst of descriptions for a film. However, it works here. It's subversive in it's stretch for external beauty over richness in character.Now the greatest issue with the film is the casting, something of which was hard to overcome. Jake Gyllenhaal is an incredible actor, capable of a multitude of things. However, he lacks the gravitas and richness that his character requires, and more so, deserves. He's strong in the role but the movie suffers due to his lack of machismo. Amy Adams is, as always, strong. The supporting cast is fairly weak though. They offer no substance and subtitles to the film. Lastly, while Michael Shannon is forever and always a 'great' - he's in a role we've seen from him time after time after...time?

I entered the cinema to watch this two days ago, not thinking much to it. Honestly, I was expecting an abstract, too modernistic way of film- making, seeing as Tom Ford isn't exactly a well established director. But, being the movie lover that I am, I decided to venture into it, if for no other reason, then purely because of the actors.I sat through the opening scenes thinking I was going to be right about the movie, anyone who's seen it will know why. I was getting ready to be bored, actually. Boy, was I wrong.The moment the plot started to unveil, I was completely hooked. I was absolutely enthralled by the music, the tension, the drama, the scenery, the amazing acting exhibited by every single actor in the movie. And the plot... Oh my god, the plot. There are no words to describe the feeling you get after the last scene ends and the movie draws to an abrupt close. It's a feeling which makes you feel sad, empty, emotionally exhausted. You feel broken, because you feel for the characters. Your thoughts start going crazy, you start analysing every single aspect of the movie, until you realise - there is no alternate ending. This is it. It just ended, and you're sitting there, running everything through your head, trying to find a meaning to relations, love and happiness. If you have someone, you will feel very grateful for having them. If not, you will definitely ask yourself - is it worth it?This movie will get you good.

But it took him a decade to write this book about his betrayal, and by all accounts it seems pretty bloody awful! Is it even published? He just sent her a copy, so we have no idea. She was probably right to leave him!But even if we get past this central hollow idea, there is the problem of the craft of the film, which aims for Lynch but feels very studenty.

Right out of the barrel, the opening scene gripped me in a visceral way, which is the intrinsic point of ""art"" after all. We see the gallery with the shocking spectacle projected on screens, which pan down to the sculptures of the subject as a reclining nude. The thematic device of the reclining nude appears several more times in the film, both as a horror and in the context of appreciable art and real life. I'm not going to ruin the film by giving a laundry list of what happens after that, but having watched the film, I must admit that the layered story-line, the careful weaving of symbolism, the transcendent tendrils of recurring imagery and an engrossing juxtaposition of timelines, where truth is stranger than fiction and art mimics life, really is composed as if with an artist's brush and it really gets down to the marrow of our daily existence and our psyches. The film makes us think about the choices we have made in our past and what we could have done to change the outcome. As a side note to the armchair malcontents, the likes of which we see far too many these days; get over yourself. The plethora of reactionary attacks of hatred unleashed upon any film that dares to be creative or different are unwarranted and quite frankly, despicable. If self-loathing nincompoops want to ""review"" something; why not review your own life? Yes. I'm talking to you. Most of you trolls who leave the imbecilic one and two star Reviews are semi-literate, immature, inadequate, spiteful, self-aggrandizing, pompous, contemptuous, unenlightened, spiteful, egotistical; as well as being the worst type of knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers on the planet and if tasked to make a movie on your own, could not do so if your life depended on it. If you hate movies that require any type of thought or creative consciousness outside the norm; just watch the films intended for people who are at the lowest point of intelligence on the Bell Curve and leave the rest of us alone. We do not care what you think. Sorry. I had to get that out of my system. If this movie was so terrible, as the oafs living in their parents' basement seem to think, then all movies are bad.",Nocturnal Animals

Lacklustre ending just dropped the ball. I don't like movies that have a sad or empty ending and this one fits that description perfectly. There were some poignant scenes that were woven masterfully into the fabric of the tale. A car chase scene that will go down for me as one of the most memorable in film. Not for being high octane special effects but for what it did to my emotions. As the characters progress along you will be swept up in the drama but I hope that you enjoy the ending and find a deeper meaning than me. I was left feeling disappointed and a bit hollow. I guess that in itself is a win for this film which strikes me as a warning sign to mistreating love.

588,ploubere,A flashy movie that is ugly inside,3,14 January 2018,"I found it designed to bring out one's worst emotions in an exploitative manner. I think it was trying to be disturbing and controversial, which it signals from the opening with a montage of obese elderly women dancing naked (which would be fine except that the intent was to portray them as clownish curiosities) but all it succeeds in doing is to force unpleasant feelings on its audience. The violence is particularly ugly and disturbing, and designed to incite impotent rage, which to me is a cheap trick. It's okay to deal with such material, but if it doesn't lead to a larger meaning and experience, then its purpose is obvious, it's a substitute for having anything meaningful to convey about the human experience. The pacing is also dreadfully slow, which is another cheap trick to simulate profundity when none is there. Which makes it, at two hours, at least a half hour too long. Yes, there is some good cinematography and the acting is highly professional and heartfelt (which is why I gave it 3 stars), but that should be a minimum standard for any movie today: There's a deep pool of topnotch talent in Hollywood these days.

To be honest, I was slightly disappointed because my expectations were very high after watching ""A Single Man."" It wasn't too bad, though. It had the beautiful cinematography and style, and everything was overdramatic, and I loved it. The transition shots were great and the whole thing had that unsettling, sometimes uncomfortable feeling to it. It switched off between the novel scenes, the real life scenes, and the flashbacks so suddenly but it was still clear what was what without clear indicators. Some parts were a little cheese, I'll agree. The soundtrack sounded like a distant ripoff from ""A Single Man."" The biggest complaint from people was that it was boring and there was no pay off. That was actually the thing I liked. The boringness of it, the limbo where nothing really happened. But the way everything was shot was so gorgeous I couldn't look away. At the end, nothing really happened either. He didn't show up while she waited and waited. But it was beautiful.

After this movie it is seemed that Tom Ford is better off to designing lady underpants as the movie continues its constant drag of somber and never really picks up. This is such a shame as there are huge potential for a movie of this size and thou the acting is terrific with Michael Shannon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams leading the way, the movie falls short of producing a hit and i soon find myself dozing off in the cinema.

604,c-urakesh,Just a joke on poor Amy Adams,6,17 February 2017,"Nocturnal Animals, the second film from Tom Ford, is the rare movie that has two endings. First, there's the ending of Nocturnal Animals, the book, which author Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal) has sent to his ex-wife, Susan (Amy Adams), for mysterious reasons. The book follows Edward Sheffield (Gyllenhaal again) as he clumsily tries to avenge the rapes and murders of his wife and daughter. It ends with Sheffield lying facedown in the dirt, accidentally shooting himself in the stomach after killing the man who terrorized his family. Oh, and he's also been struck in the eye with a farming implement. Not exactly a happy ending.But it's not that much more depressing than that the ending of Nocturnal Animals, the movie, which closes on Adams's Susan, sitting at an opulent Los Angeles restaurant, finishing off her second expensive cocktail, waiting for Tony to arrive. He never does.So, what the hell's going on here? Is this all just a joke on poor Amy Adams? Why did Tony dedicate the book to her?On the surface, Nocturnal Animals plays as a thriller in the Sam Peckinpah mold, a brutal allegory about the worst natures of men, mostly because of the story-within-the-story. Tony's novel is pitch- black and disturbing, and Susan's real life is aesthetically beautiful but devoid of substance, an empty exercise in wealth and beauty. (Ironically, a common criticism of Ford's own work.)It's in Susan's narrative that you can begin to suss out the complexity of the plot, which all dovetails in that ending. First, we have to go back to the beginning, and end, of Tony and Susan's relationship. They meet as students, but divorce when Susan finds herself exhausted by Tony's sensitivity, the thing that drew her to him in the first place. She leaves him for Hutton Morrow, the kind of stone-hewn alpha male who could only be played by Armie Hammer. After the breakup, Tony writes the novel he could never manage when he was with Susan, full of the type of vicious, aggressive action she seemed to be encouraging him toward.Meanwhile, as Susan becomes transfixed by the book, we see a strange mirroring of its violence in the world around her. The movie's first scene takes place at a gallery opening, where naked obese women dance around on video, a layered misogyny she seems, at most, ambivalent about. And as Susan falls deeper into Tony's novel, these images keep appearing: an animal pierced by arrows; a painting on the wall that says ""REVENGE""; an apparition appearing in a colleague's cell phone. The art world is often criticized for celebrating subversion for subversion's sake, but here, in light of her ex-husband's descent into hell, these images take on actual meaning. As an artist, Tony's work turns out to be disturbing and affecting, seducing Susan all over again with what seems to be the only grain of truth in her life.Which brings us back to the final scene. Tony ghosts on Susan at their planned meeting, forcing her to confront her own superficiality, how easily she's won back. On one hand, it's a childish thing to do, rubbing her face in her own attraction; on the other, it's the ultimate rejection of what he represents to her. For Ford, Tony seems to represent integrity, a person seeking truth and finding it at great cost. (Does he also represent, for the sophomore director, the virtues and opportunities of cinema? Maybe!) Susan, then, signifies the empty promise of luxury for its own sake. (Ergo, fashion, if we're going full psychoanalyst here.) After all, in the book Tony's doppelgänger loses everything twice over: His family is taken from him, and his pursuit of revenge costs him his life. Considering the book's ending, Tony's final rejection of Susan might also be costing him his life — but it's the only choice he has.At least those cocktails looked good.",Nocturnal Animals
605,martin-nba,One of a kind experience.,10,12 February 2017,"Easily the best film I have seen this year. Great performance by all the actors, fantastic plot with a lot of deep meaning and a very atmospheric soundtrack. It's a very unique film. It reminds me of Basic Instinct but without the sex and drugs. It looks like a 90s masterpiece brought from back in time, a solid prove that Tom Ford is a great director.True love comes once in a lifetime, and we rarely get a second chance. This film is about revenge and personal progress in life, Its about how the decisions of the past can haunt our lives in the future and how the pain we cause to others always comes back to us. This movie sends a strong message to the people who easily give up on other people and never give them a fair chance to shine.I can't understand why some people rated this movie 1/10, just the performance of the actors and the soundtrack of the film should be enough to give it a solid 5.",Nocturnal Animals
606,peterdm1994,Interesting,6,15 November 2020,"The director said the ending was shaped to be subjective and interpreted by the viewer.
Most interpretations I've seen swing one way or the other: either Edward stood Susan up because he had finally overcome his ""weakness"" and didn't need her anymore, or Edward actually killed himself because of the devastation of their relationship.
I think the (albeit subjective) truth comes more from his narrative. Probably the most gripping scene was Tony's meltdown after Lou was shot and Ray got away. Bobby turns to Tony confused as to why he wasn't satisfied with Lou's death and probably more confused as to why Tony hadn't shot both of them when he had the chance. Bobby even said to him, ""You know I had to shoot him right?"" In response, Tony screamed, ""I'm glad he's dead... (falls to his knees, cries, and screams) I should have stopped it.""
I think this is the clearest picture we get of Edward's true turmoil.
There are clear parallels between Edward and Tony's stories. The most significant is that both lose their wife and child. Tony's family dies by battery and Edward's family dies by abortion and (symbolically) divorce. The director makes it plainly obvious by the piece of artwork that stops Susan in her tracks towards the end of the film, this is a revenge story. In the novel, Tony is at first passive with his revenge on the victimizers, letting Bobby kill the first one. This is reminiscent of his 19 years of silence. Then he finds confidence and fights Ray which eventually kills him. And I think this is the parallel for the final scene. Edward finds confidence to write a novel which he uses to vengefully torment Susan. And even though it seems like it could have reconnected the previously married couple, it divides them and leaves Edward to die. Whether he committed suicide or continued living his life until he died of old age, it shows how he and Susan are completely divorced from their entire world. Edward has no wife and no children. Susan has neither first or second husband and her relationship to her mother and daughter are both shaky at best.
I think Edward's biggest source of pain comes from the line, ""I should have stopped it."" I think he partially blames himself for not being able to stop the abortion. Maybe if he had fought longer for their marriage, they would have got the news of pregnancy together and Susan would not have gone through with it. It's a bit of a darker perspective but it's the parallel I see from the novel.
Either way, it was an interesting movie.",Nocturnal Animals

You can clearly see the work of Tom Ford in it and there are many things that draw comparisons to his debut film 'a single man.' Stylistically it is similar, most notably through the musical score. What impressed me most about it was the symbolism of the book that Amy Adams reads. You can clearly see that the wife of Tony represents Amy Adams' character in real life and what she used to be, from Edward's perspective. The character of Ray Marcus seems to represent what Susan then became from Edwards perspective after the terrible things she did to him. Ford also drops various visual cues in the story, such as the red couch that he finds his dead wife and daughter on, that represent things in the real-life narrative. Overall, the film was a technical wonder. The only reason I couldn't rate it higher was because the script didn't quite match the other aspects of the film and the themes the film was trying to explore were unclear.

The story is simple enough but the themes and the messages are what will really spark the conversation and what turns it into an intellectual movie.

Thank you Tom Ford for making this great movie. the way you link between them in the movie is amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal was very quiet throughout the movie. after Amy Adams left him for another man, he didn't lose his patience. he lost his second wife and his daughter and because he is a very kind man he didn't think about anything bad. I think he thought about good more than bad may be this his mistake. For me I know that Edward knew from deep inside that he is coward. he only need someone to believe in him. If you can see his way of expressing his happiness for killing Lou. his feeling is mixed between joy and anger. Edward wanted to end his wife and daughter case between him and him. So after killing Ray he felt he can leave everything. Edward weakness point is coward. he was very brace till the end for my opinion. At the end I think anyone enjoyed the movie can remember his word "" you have the same sadness eye as your mother""- Edward said. The last scene was amazing. I can't stop thinking about this movie especially Jake Gyllenhaal. You have to watch it anyway.",Nocturnal Animals

619,flipp-27962,What a treat! FANTASTIC Dark Thriller!,10,7 January 2017,"Wow, I am speechless, just came back from the cinema. LOVED THE MOVIE!First of all, the movie is beautifully displayed. I enjoyed every shot of it, Tom Ford did a great job there, every scene is perfectly built. Secondly, the acting! The movie is slow paced and has not too much conversation, but it doesn't need it with all this spectacular acting. This is one of the best performances I have seen from Jack Gyllenhaal, he puts so much depth and emotion to his character. The Cop, Michael Shannon plays terrific as always. But for me the real star was the villain. Kickass Actor Aaron Taylor acts fantastic, his mimic's, the way he makes noises with his mouth to further enhance his point in conversations, just perfection to me. Thirdly, it is extremely thrilling and you are on the edge of your seats on many occasions, hoping for the good. Watch this movie if you enjoy a slow, but THRILLING, very dark, very brutal (not gory, but psychologically violent) Texas Thriller.Cheers mates!",Nocturnal Animals
620,loubnan,"Tom Ford's sublime movie,yet again ...",8,24 December 2016,"i want to thank you as your posts helped me have a deeper insight of the movie.I also watched it again, it was true, the second time you pay attention to details that are very important and also some of the clues i missed the first time. I noticed the wife of the novel looked so much like Susan, and both her daughter and she ,had long red hair like Susan,which would be true in real life,and also i realized he might have found out about the abortion and created this fictional family or just imagined the would-be family. When their bodies were found,the wife had the cross (pendant) next to her mouth,at the same time they show Susan reading the novel and toying with the same cross ( Edward kept many details real). then i noticed the painting ""RE -VEN-GE "" on the wall that Susan was observing and did not recall buying it, it was another clue for the movie's hidden meaning.. the ending, as far as I am concerned ,is quite clear. He made her read the whole manuscript which was a complete and detailed account of the whole trauma,pain,agony,loss,and so much more he had gone through and had to live with, for 19 years because of her. He wanted to reach out to her in a time of her life where she made a total circle, in other words ended up like her mother, with a loveless marriage, a failure as artist, sleepless and he wanted her to hope that he would come back to her and save her from this miserable life. yes, in a way it was his bitter satisfaction, or ""revenge"" as some shallow people might say,and thus, his task was accomplished, he didn't need to actually meet her.some things are better left unsaid they say or better "" one picture equals 1000 words"". she sat there waiting, full of mixed emotions, hope, and slowly slowly her features started to shift from hope to... emptiness.the total realization of how much she really hurt him (killed him literally),and gave him, in a way, a cancer.the worst illness of all. I also have to mention the beautiful,really beautiful music that matched perfectly the loneliness,emptiness, and the pain of the characters. Kudos TOM Ford!! regards.",Nocturnal Animals

Nobody. Maybe I have a brain tumor, but I can't believe I've seen the same movie as everything else. This is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's stylish and vapid, a movie made for wealthy, wannabe-artists by a wealthy, bored, and arrogant man. You don't care about the story or the characters, everything is so predictable and stale (despite the """"""SYMBOLIC"""""" shots and editing). It took less than 15 minutes for me to bail, which I did, multiple times. The rest of it I sat through laughing and cringing in secondhand embarrassment. Line delivery was terrible, the dialogue was shockingly stupid- like the story's direction, you always know what the characters will say and feel 5 minutes ahead; the WORST CASE of ""telling, and not showing"" is present in literally every aspect of the movie. Tom Ford rams every 'symbol"" and embarrassingly preachy statement about modern society down your throat, and you sit there, bored and repeating, ""I GET IT, I GET IT DUDE"" into your hands whenever Amy Adams takes a shower.

622,screenslut98,mesmerizing visuals with thriller,9,11 February 2017,"The second film from designer turned directory Tom Ford was not just a visual masterpiece but had great narrative. The plot of the movie which is three narratives combined into one and tells the story of Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) thriller novel dedicated to her. The way that the story was told was bold, strange and very unique to me. Even though a movie with three narratives might sound clumsy but it wasn't, the stories of different time lines did not overlap each other rather it made the story complete with showing different aspects of the characters.Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as Ray Marcus was definitely my favorite, he was so creep and repulsive to watch. The brilliant Michael Shannon was also in this movie as Bobby Andes with great Oscar worthy performance. Overall, I loved this movie for it's visual look and appeal of it's leading characters. While I was watching the movie I liked Tom Ford's directing style, storytelling, cinematography and after watching it I started to think about it while connecting the dots between the different narratives and it easily became my favorite movie to think about.

I think this is some revenge flick that a writer used to smear his ex in literary fiction because he had personal issues. The ending falls flat on it's face as it trails off which is a middle finger to anyone that was interested in the ex-wife's story.TL;DR: Rent it, Watch only the family story line and fast-forward through the ex-wife and writer story line.

I'd say the acting is very interesting (I am not not good at saying whether acting is good or not, I guess actors are acting as they are asked by directors, so this is not very often that I adventure myself in saying any acting is good or bad).
However, I did not like the story. It made me think of Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, not sure about which one exactly, I think this is probably more Lost Highway; the atmosphere is interesting, characters are intriguing, but I would have needed some more answers, some more real facts to chew. I actually did rate quite good Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway at the time I saw it because of the atmosphere, but, now that I grew older and that I have seen more I need real thriller with real answers that would twist my mind, I guess some would say some more ""easy"" movies.

Parts of it are so tragically believable.",Nocturnal Animals
636,emmalkjohnston,Psychologically intriguing but underwhelming thriller,7,20 July 2019,"This film is about Susan, a wealthy art gallery owner and the re-entry of her ex-husband into her life via his novel that he sends her to read previous to it being published. This happens 20 years after their marriage ended in a way that devastated him.The way that the film develops is unusual and interesting. Her life, drenched with cold colours and repression contrasts sharply with the unravelling of the novel as she reads it, with its warm colour palette and constant violence that it expresses. Through flashbacks we piece together what happened between Susan and ex-husband Edward and try to figure out what he's trying to say to her through his novel.This unravelling is interesting as the characters in the book as well as Edwards real-life behaviour all serve as symbols that reveal how he sees the separation of their marriage and other events surrounding it. The way it strikes me though is that this would all be a lot less meaningful to Susan if she weren't in a fragile state as a result of her marriage and becoming someone who she doesn't really want to be. So the film is as much about Edward being unable to move on from the trauma that happened 20 years ago as it is about Susan having a lot of unprocessed emotions that mostly stem from her relationship with her mother.The film is able to convey a lot with little but it lacks cohesion, moving on from important details a bit too quickly. The association between Susan and the antagonist characters in Edwards novel isn't very well developed and the central messages from the book could be better developed and more impactful. Though there's a lot to pull apart, overall it's a bit of an underwhelming film and though complex, not very deep in a way that's meangful or particularly thought provoking.",Nocturnal Animals

They could easily drive away. Even with a flat tire (which they didn't know they had yet anyway) they should try and escape since they were in danger. Then a police car drives by and it doesn't stop when in the dark of the night two cars with their lights on are at the side of the road and 2 women are running, screaming and waving their hands at it...right... Even at the end when the enraged protagonist is aiming at his wife's and daughter's killer, he closes his eyes for many agonizing seconds. For no reason. As if he is not aiming at a dangerous desperate man trying to flee. If we leave the book out, the whole story is about a shallow woman that was horrible to her ex husband and now regrets it because her younger new husband doesn't want her anymore and she is trapped in a pretentious job. That's it. I really liked the parallelism of her cruelty towards her husband, to the cruelty of the men in the book. That was food for thought.",Nocturnal Animals

A lot will wonder what the ending signified so I'll tell you only enough to make you watch it again if not understand instantly. Amy Adams killed Tonys girls and killed Tony in the end too. Not literally of course but symbolically that's how it happened. That book is Edward's way of F*** **** to ex wife Susan for killing his baby, killing the woman he fell in love with and ultimately killing the soft hearted person he was when she left.

In cinematography with its change of color palette for different time frames and stories, in composition and in mood. In the actor game for Amy Adams is not only gorgeous to look at, but an amazing actress and those eyes are beautiful, Jake Gyllenhaal has always been an astonishing actor, but the MVPs here are more surprisingly Michael Shannon, who is one of the best actors today, and Aaron Taylor- Johnson who you just detest in this movie. It is a tough rough suspenseful film that keeps you watching and it's so good. You never get bored and you never get annoyed.

655,sarcheths,The dark side of Nocturnal Animals,8,15 December 2016,"If you like film as art then you should take a chance on Nocturnal Animals but I should warn you that the movie itself is dark (literately and figuratively), disturbing and extremely tense. When the 1 hour and 56 minutes were over I felt like I could finally take a breath again. As the opening credits roll the first camera shot focuses on a living piece of art. The indie movie then follows a lonely (in marriage and career) woman named Susan played by the amazing Amy Adams as she receives and reads a manuscript for a novel written by her ex-husband. That is when things get weird. The superb Jake Gyllenhaal plays two roles, as Susan's ex Edward (in flashbacks) and the main character in his manuscript, Tony Hastings. I know it sounds confusing and at times it is. I would go as far to say Nocturnal Animals is really 3 stories in 1 and have to admit that if you took away Amy Adam's character the story would not change too much. After all the story within the story that she is reading is more than half of the film. That being said the viewer is seeing Edward's words come alive through Susan's eyes which makes for a crazy and very imperatively brain overload. The acting by Adams and Gyllenhaal give the film its emotion and heart as I felt what they felt throughout the aspects of the stories being told. All filmmakers are artists but director Tom Ford (A Single Man) took his paintbrush and created something any artist (struggling or not) should be proud of. The look of Texas by director of photography Seamus McGarvey by day and by night was beautiful and scary. I know I usually don't write about or pay much attention to the so called lesser award show categories but on that point the Production Design by Shane Valentino, Set Decoration by Meg Everist, Art Direction by Christopher Brown and Editor Joan Sobel made the film even more fascinating to look at and allowed this viewer to throw herself into the lives of those on the big screen. The movie is written by Ford based a book by Austin Wright. It also stars Michael Shannon, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer and Michael Sheen.

Hard to know where to start as it deserves nothing less. I can only assume that the awards people are on acid or just landed from an orbiting star. Tom Ford seriusly needs to stick to designing frocks and spend less time on what can only be heralded as some epic navel gazing. The only film I can think of that comes close to regurgitating such utter, self- indulgent spunk is The Danish Girl. Both directors could do well to go back to wherever it was they thought they found their 'calling' and pull their idiotic heads out of their collective rectums. Perhaps the judges of the Globes etc should stop worrying about who's watching their every move and concentrate on the ancient and almost extinct, it seems, art of storytelling...? Just a thought.",Nocturnal Animals
661,jesslgrdn,"For all its emphasis, an utterly weak and painfully mundane plot.",2,25 March 2017,"Digging around on Netflix and Vudu I have discovered films (that I had never heard of before) possessing great plots and actors with paramount meaning, that failed to reach their potential because they lacked equally skilled cinematographers, composers, arrangers, or sound effects. Nocturnal Animals indeed has great acting, cinematographers, composers, and an overall extremely talented production team... but a plot that could be described as tangential at best. I also found the random and rather large doses of nudity disconcerting for a movie that could have very well been PG- 13. People are raving about Tom Ford as if he was some kind of genius (calling the first 10 minutes of nudity 'art') for this work but alas I disagree. This movie made me think of an artist with only paint, a brush, and a canvas in his studio... passionately dancing, violently thrashing, and flinging paint onto his medium during this emphatic display of emotion. For all his elegance and technique, for all the thought and emotion he put into his work it simply doesn't make what lands on the canvas a moving or marvelous piece of art. The technique and method in producing the piece itself proves far more impressive than the finished product. I kept waiting the entire movie for some climax and thought 'Surely this is going to come together and blow my mind' but it didn't and worse ended with the most pitiful exchange. For all its' pomp and decadence, for all the great effort and clear talent involved in this production I was deeply disappointed to find the random haphazard plot that had just unfolded before me was just that...gurgling ramblings with no larger relatable meaning that tied into the anticlimactic conclusion. I've heard some discuss the satisfaction of seeing Susan end up with a meaningless life, cheating husband, etc But the story doesn't make Susan villain enough for the audience to care, or Edward hero or loved enough for us to be satisfied either. It seems to me only a petty person would be thrilled by this not knowing either of them. Sure there were 'hidden' meanings here and there parts that had full intention of speaking to the human soul, yet all this was wasted on a story line that simply didn't come together as a whole in the end. The only decipherable messages in this film are rife with clichés and the only feeling I was left with after the introduction and ending was immense disgust. I'm sure that there are idiots out there that would or have paid millions for ""art"" made from simply splashing elements onto a canvas; created methodically and deliberately out of chaos. In the end this film had no profound meaning and having not been inside the mind of the maker, onlookers can only imagine what it was supposed to mean, like taking an ink blot test. Were the same stretch of imagination necessary to perceive the amount of meaning in this plot needed to call this film revolutionary used in an ink blot test I imagine interpreter would likely believe the patient borderline delusional there is after all a fine line between delusion and genius. Perhaps that is what has some people so thrilled by this because the larger meaning is something left to the imagination of the viewer to create but with no real conclusion and the only recognizable theme being petty revenge within the 'real' plot, I was left rolling my eyes at the end. I was irritated that there are so many people out there who thought this was marvelous that I wasted an evening to watch it. I was also thoroughly disturbed at the terrible waste of talent on this film. I did learn one thing from this experience; I will never again give weight to the ratings without first scouring the written reviews. I will also likely avoid at all costs anything by Tom Ford or anything that remotely resembles this film.",Nocturnal Animals

Some people hated the movie because they thought the ending was too abrupt, however, all the tools to make the movie have a beginning, middle and good ending are there. You just have to find them to give meaning to the movie. Ford took his audience seriously. Using imagery instead of exposition he puts the movie stylishly together. It's a revenge story: Edward wants revenge on Susan for leaving him and killing their unborn child. Ford sets this up using the painting titled ""Revenge"". We go into a flashback where Susan tells Edward to stop writing about himself. This gives us an idea that Tony, the character in the book, is based on Edward himself. He too lost a wife (Susan) and a daughter (unborn child). Tony takes revenge and dies by accidentally killing himself. The movie ends with Edward not showing up in the restaurant. Did he kill himself his revenge now complete?I understand the film doesn't give all the answers so you have to formulate your own. The book was written for Susan because only she would get the message. The text from Edward asking her to meet up with him was his perfect set-up knowing she would long for him once again. His revenge perfect when he didn't show up. Susan was already haunted by her past life and she will never get the satisfaction of forgiveness.",Nocturnal Animals

For Sheffield, there is a clear question around masculinity throughout and for Morrow, a bitter realisation of her underlying weaknesses and regret for her actions.Gyllenhaal continuous to show his impressive arsenal of on screen emotion. Adams is very graceful, but does not need to have the same level of depth as Gyllenhaal. Both Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are similarly not asked for too much, but nonetheless give solid performances.Looking at the settings for both stories they could have taken any style, but Ford's past helped with his selection.

672,bloek-798-266296,Will two stories scrambled into one make a good movie?,5,29 December 2016,"SPOILERS Here's what I felt about Nocturnal Animals – it's not an accurate description of the movie, it's just what stuck with me after I left the theater.One of the biggest flaws of Nocturnal Animals to me is its underdeveloped characters and ironically, that's the main focus of the movie. Instead of proper character development, the protagonists tell us their characteristics in a blatant manner. Never do we really witness Susan's strength in any scene, yet her mother and ex-husband will remind us every so often how strong she is. The same goes for Edward's weakness and romantic side. All characteristics are repeatedly described in simple terms like ""strong"", ""weak"", ""romantic"", but never in any action or detail. With the one exception of Susan's sad eyes, which we will see (and of course also hear of) a lot. What we will also get a lot are stylish scenes in the form of art and scenery. I have to give it to this movie, the style is top notch. But that's not what makes a good movie about characters What I needed from this movie more than anything are intelligent and deep conversations and I felt the dialogue between the protagonist to be bland and generic. The bad guys behave just like your average bad guys, the main characters never say more than what serves the purpose of the story. There's nothing for my brain to work with, because everything is spilled out for me as clearly as possible and I already know exactly where the journey is leading us to. Tony is losing his beloved family in a violent manner and he becomes scarred and devastated by the event. He then seeks and gets his revenge. The telling of this story line is average at best. Apart from the cruelty of how they die and probably the most compelling side character Bobby the policemen, there's not much to it. When I think of this as a stand-alone film, I would not be giving it much credit, because it's just a straight line and I couldn't help but think: ""can we get this over with, please"". Susan has become unhappy in her current life and threw away her only chance of being happy 20 years ago. She broke off her marriage with Edward in a cruel manner which we will soon find out about: she cheated on him and aborted his child. Because of this event, Edward became scarred and devastated - and thus, the link between the two story lines is established. When Susan is sitting in the restaurant at the end of the movie waiting for Edward, it's already clear that he is not coming. Why? Because he told us so during the movie: ""you will probably only have one chance"". Susan's mother will also tell us, how Susan will be feeling and behaving after she marries Edward – and it plays out exactly like she said. It doesn't feel organic to me how the story unfolds itself and how the fates of the characters play out – it feels more like the writer is forcing the story into the direction it takes. So to me the main story line of two characters falling out of touch with each other, betrayal and coming to terms with it is also pretty straight and lackluster to stand on its own.In the end, there's no big question to be answered and no real payoff. The characters are too underdeveloped for me to truly care for them. Two average but stylish movies scrambled into one don't make one good movie in my opinion.",Nocturnal Animals
673,fearthepiff,Nocturnal Animals misunderstands what its focus should be.,4,30 November 2016,"Nocturnal Animals gets so swept up in the crime drama the lead is reading that it loses focus on the foundation of the film, which is the frame this picture resides.The film, based off the novel Tony and Susan, by Austin Wright, starts with a beautifully crafted montage of larger, older, nude women dancing in celebratory garb as they dance along to the opening credits. These women are revealed to be the center of an art exhibit in Susan Morrow's (Amy Adams) art gallery. Adams' character is distant, sad, and you can tell she's troubled by the first shot of her eyes. The film picks up with her married to her second husband, one she suspects of cheating, and the plot starts when she receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's new novel: Nocturnal Animals.The film chronicles Susan reading the novel, and we see into what the novel is about as we see Nocturnal Animal's main character, Tony, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (who also plays Edward, Susan's ex-husband and the writer of the novel), who is on a road trip with her wife (played by Isla Fisher in a very clever casting choice) and daughter, when something goes awry.The film starts off beautifully shot, and is reminiscent of old film noir; it's classically shot and it helps set-up the film so well, and sets up a very interesting premise, but it loses steam more and more as the film goes on, and what you think is a set-up to for a film about a woman's past catching up with her is really about a woman reading a book, and the film mistakenly obsesses over the book's plot as if it's all we came to the theater for.The film teases all these plot points about Susan's life through flashbacks which really don't get tied up in a nice bow, but instead they are more like the laces of a shoe that instead of being tied up they are shoved into the shoe under the foot to save time.The book should've been a plot device the help move the film forward, and as we find out what happens to Tony, we get to piece together Susan's life. Instead, the film sets up this frame story where it's almost as if Susan only exists to be a vessel for us to read about Tony. The film forgets to care about this bigger arc that is Susan Morrow's story, and only gives us the resolution to the smaller story that takes place in the novel of Nocturnal Animals. It cares too much about this book when all I want to know about is the person who wrote it.The worst part is, the book ends with a sputter, and you're left thinking ""Really?"" as the film starts to wrap up. The characters and plot of the book start to become more dumb and hammy as the film goes on, and less believable, too, which makes you care even less.The film should've been about finding out Susan's past as we find out Tony's story, and then come back to Susan as she reacts to this book, but instead the film almost cares more about this fictitious Tony instead of caring about the real characters of Susan and Edward. The film loses so much steam because all you want to know about is Susan and Edward and all the specifics of what happened to them, when all you really get is......Tony and Susan.",Nocturnal Animals

Why anyone is talking about this film in terms of awards flummoxes me.This awful film wasn't helped by the marketing blurb that made it sound like it was a thriller in which the main female lead is worried about her ex plotting revenge. It was nothing of the sort. If she was even slightly worried I couldn't tell. I guess him sending her his awful book was revenge enough in itself.The scenes in which the dreary woman moped about reading the book just made the film longer and increasingly dull. Maybe they were supposed to be art masquerading as cinematography? The best bits were the dramatization of the book. Tom Ford might learn some useful lessons by watching some of Peter Greenaway's films.There was an excess of style of substance. What was the point of the corpulent women at the start? Or the nonsense in the pseudo-art gallery? This film was made by an aspiring artist - but not a storyteller. It was completely unsatisfying and I loathed it.

""Nocturnal Animals"" is an excellent proof of how you, as a director, can generate anxiety, disgust and curiosity, all three at the same time, in the minds of the audience. Tom Ford show us the contradictions of a life based on luxury and splendor, and how these elements, accompanied by a morbid obsession for success, transfigure in a sort of forfeiture of values, where only sentiments as rage, regret and revenge can come to light.

688,scarfmanitan,"A book of fiction, A story of reality",8,6 February 2019,"The movie begins with the life of Amy Adams' character who we quickly find out is in a relationship with a cheating husband. At the same time her ex-husband(Jake) has sent her a fictional book to read which truly marks the beginning of the movie.The movie revolves around the reality that is Amy's character reading the novel and the fiction that is the story of Jake's character in the novel. The movie constantly switches between the two and it becomes apparent quickly that the novel is especially meaningful to Amy's character and the lines of fiction and reality begin to be blurred in a sense.The novel seems to essentially be depicting Jake's feelings/life during his life with and after Amy. The tense 20 minute scene where Ray and his crew surround Jake, Amy and Daughter and finally abscond with them looks to be a metaphor for Amy's new husband taking her from Jake.(Side note: Jake was a bit of a pussy, barely put up a fight). Amy ultimately dying may be an allusion to the way Jake felt inside, that he had lost a woman he truly loved. Jake finally confronting Ray(the rapist and killer) could symbolize him finally finding peace with the situation and thus him writing the novel he always wanted. In reality this could be a way to not only show Amy how he felt metaphorically but also to perhaps maybe even pass on a bit of guilt her way.Back in reality we see that Amy is not handling reading the Novel perfectly as she hallucinates Jake and also focuses on a poster titled revenge. This focus on the revenge poster could be to give insight that Amy realizes that the book was not simply meant for her to read nut also to get her thinking of the wrong she did.In the end Amy asks to meet Jake but Jake never shows up. Perhaps this is the end of the ultimate revenge in which Jake get the last laugh as he did in the novel. Jake not showing up could be for a number of reasons. Maybe he cant go through the sight of seeing someone he finally got over. Maybe he justs wants her to feel what he felt. Or maybe he killed himself just as he did at the end of the novel after finally writing the perfect novel/getting over Amy.Overall I enjoyed the movie. The acting was great from both Amy and Jake and I loved the direction of 2 stories coinciding and the fiction basically being symbolic of the reality that transpired. I still wonder if it would have been better if the movie focused solely on the novel as though that were reality and that story was fleshed out with more tension throughout trying to locate Amy and ultimately the killers. I found myself not really caring for reality at some points in the film and only wanting to see the novel scenes. Which i think perfectly depicts that Jake did finally write the perfect novel he was looking for.A even crazier idea I had while watching the movie was that the whole kidnapping the girls scene was actually something that really happened and was a flashback. It obviously became clear this wasn't the case when they died. But suppose all this happened in reality without Amy and daughter dying and she had to live with this for the rest of her life.... and the movie revolves around this???I dont now just giving off some thoughts that came across my mind.

Although it says ""Not a single Tom Ford product appears in the film, as Ford ""didn't want a commercial."""", most of it pretty much looks like a commercial for Channel, Gucci or some other designer, very easy on the eye (Amy Adams's life in particular) but with no essence whatsoever. For the story, I liked it, that's it, the one that the book written in the movie is telling, it was the best for me, it reminded me of some Flanney O'Connor stories. About the acting, with such good leading actors, I thought they didn't do their best job, specially Amy, or maybe her character was just boring, but I didn't believe that she was the art dealer living a miserable life, barely any lines, if you watch the trailer that's pretty much what she says throughout all the film. You could have even discarded the husband and the friends and it would have been the same thing. Jake Gylenhaal's character on the main story (the book) was powerful but again, I didn't think it was his best work. What really saved the movie was having Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon. They really gave life to it. Another thing it bothered me was that it looked that they didn't even try to make Amy Adams look young for the story happening 19 years earlier or older than her years for the story happening in present day. Overall, I believe like someone said it was a pretentious job, it could have been better but at the end it felt flat",Nocturnal Animals

If ""A Single Man"" was a fabulous work, this one, with all the hype and expectation, fails miserably.A good casting can't save a very weak and poor screenplay. Actually, it gets even worst..why?Well, first of all, Jake Gyllenhaal. His fit body and muscles don't match with his poor attitude and weak character. In terms of acting he's really good but he's not credible. Then, Amy Adams, always bored and hallucinated, fogged from her past and present. A perfect cliché of a rich and deluded woman. Michael Shannon is good, but again, they ruined a bit his character which in most of the cases is too much emphasized.The setting. Again, a world full of clichés. The art world, always depicted with exaggerated characters, with their advice on which is the best psychoanalyst..surrounded with effeminate men. Fancy and unlikely dresses, botox on ex Barbie faces..things we already saw and that don't bring any added or original value to the story. (see also Neon Demon)The screenplay. Weak. No twists (if needed). The dialogues are poor, that poor that they lower down the value of the movie.So again, after ""A Single Man"" I was expecting something at its value, but this one doesn't even get closer. Some nice landscapes..but even the editing sometimes seems amateur.And to finish..the end of the film is very trivial. A pity :(",Nocturnal Animals

We are immersed in a contemporary psychological drama, a problematic relationship which looks like it has been losing momentum for a long time, alternated with a ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" meets ""Psycho"" via Spielberg's all-time standard-setter ""Duel"" story - really, a story - of connected but time-distanced events. This is clever but omits the real intelligence of a summary, a final explanation.Try to put it all together, and any conclusion as to what story we've just been told is speculative intellectual guesswork.That....is not enough.In fact, looking at what I have just written may just be as inconclusive as ""Nocturnal Animals"".",Nocturnal Animals

However in Nocturnal Animals Ford still creates a visually stunning film but with a very character driven story and a lot more dialogue. For me it felt like a very complete film. Ford was able to move through the characters Past, Present and the Non-fictional story (written by Gyllenhaals character Edward) through clever filming and cinematography.(+score in my opinion was beautiful) The ending, in my opinion, was killer. Endings often ruin films for me, and I can safely say that this one definitely did not.

699,vlchristos-84023,Dark and open to interpretation,8,11 January 2017,"""Nocturnal animals"" is quite a thrilling movie. It is as quite as dark as anyone would expect and seems to me quite deep and complex. The main features of the film are the allegories and parallels between the ""real world"" and the ""novel"". Or, at least, how Susan perceives those parallels, given her current state. Even though she is successful at her job, she's is in an unhappy marriage, her husband cheats on her, she's taking drugs, losing interest in her work and sleepless. Quite fragile, if not on the verge of ""cracking"". She parallels the story with their relationship. She instantly depicts Tony as Edward. He is weak, he cant defend himself, he cant defend his family. Her aborted child is Tony's daughter. She probably thinks all Edward wants is revenge, just like Tony. The novel is a ""take that! how you like me now? I made it, i wrote a novel about myself and got published"". That is why she notices the ""REVENGE"" poster, because she's cynical, as she says. However, I don't think that's all. Tony wants revenge at first, but he can't pull the trigger. Because he realizes that revenge won't bring back his family. I think that this is Edward's state now. He wanted revenge from Susan when he started writing the novel. But he doesn't need it anymore. He got hurt deeply, yes. But by the end of it he has gotten over the breakup. Revenge is like Bobby's cancer, killing him from the inside. I think that this is his message. I'm over you, i hope you're over our marriage, too. There is also something else, that puts things under a different perspective. When Tony walks out of the trailer, one of his eyes is shut, covered in blood. Just like Susan's eye is always covered by her hair. And he clutches his cross in his dying moments, just like Susan does quite a lot often. What if Tony's ""real"" parallel is Susan, not Edward? What if she is the weak one? What if she's the one yelling ""I should have stopped it""? Meaning she shouldn't walk away from their relationship. Based on what we know she's in an unhappy marriage and an unhappy position overall. We don't know almost anything about Edward's state. The way I see it she is regretful. She reminisces of that time of her life, and maybe wonders ""what if i had done things differently?"". ""When you love someone you have to be careful with it, you might never get it again"", is what he had told her. ""Passion doesn't last forever"", is what Carlos' wife said. And I think that Susan ultimately understands all these. She probably hadn't when she sent that e-mail to Edward. But she does in the end. It doesn't matter why he never appeared, whether it's another (or the actual) act of revenge or just because he is too busy with his own life that he forgot their rendezvous. For her, it's the ultimate hit. It's the gunshot in the stomach. I presume she had high hopes, as she took off her wedding ring. But she's left distraught. She feels the pain she caused. So, from now on, she either gets over it, moves on and starts a new life from the beginning, or, she ends it at all.",Nocturnal Animals

701,timreviews,Tom Ford crafts a smart and gripping psychological drama that leaves you thinking for days.,9,13 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is not a movie for everybody, as it has themes of murder, revenge, rape and the personal fears everybody has yet they refuse to confront. Nocturnal Animals is a psychological drama disguised as a violent revenge thriller, yet it still has those aspects in it. All the performances are amazing, with there being not a single weak actor in the film. The directing is incredible in a way that can capture raw emotion with hidden details such as visual cues and the fact that the scenes that are supposed to take place in the story within a story felt as if they were stolen from another film entirely and connected together so seamlessly in a way that showcases immense flexibility from Tom Ford in the skills of directing. It's layered, complex and really messed up, Aaron Taylor Johnson came out with a performance that got under my skin at parts. This is not a perfect movie, as I could count two or three visual cues that felt slightly on the nose and the scene with the Baby monitor was a directing choice I didn't really agree with. Other than those minute complaints, Nocturnal Animals is a fantastic movie by a fantastic director, although it isn't for everybody is still is a movie I would recommend to those who would want to see it.

703,emilybnightingale,"Cliché, wanted to leave, but still a reasonably entertaining movie",3,16 November 2016,"This was more like a window into Tom Ford's brain. No one in this movie could exist in real life. Each person is a two-dimensional stereotype: the cold, debutante Texan mother, the weak hopeless romantic starter husband, the cold banker with ""an important deal"" who flies to NY to see his mistress, the annoying people who work at art galleries. Not a single story line was plausible, the stories otherwise had noticeable holes and useful coincidences, and the dialogue was painful and unrealistic to the point of bordering on absurd (other than the scene on the road). Tom Ford should have gone to rural Texas for a few weeks, talked to a banker, and generally done some research on how people in location x, or with job y, or female, actually act. My favorite gaffe was a post-abortion scene (trying not to give anything away, but this is important to show the ridiculousness), which was out of a soap opera. First of all, you're post-op (usually general anesthesia, too) after an abortion, and in a lot of pain and bleeding heavily. But this character was fine, and in this 15 second scene that was too important to last only 15 seconds, the woman ridiculously said that the dad can never now, but then - gasp! - oh no he's right there looking at us! In the rain! Was that supposed to be a parody? The only bearable scene was the last one. Ford clearly can make things look very pretty (and it helps that he uses a zillion models, and he couldn't resist the green cowboy boots, if I'm remembering correctly), but he lowered the bar considerably since A Single Man, which came from a deeper place for him, it seems, and was felt far deeper.",Nocturnal Animals

In another words, you have to watch carefully to get the moral of this movie. Nocturnal Animals isn't mind-bending like (Enemy) or (The Fountain), but it simply has big deals of ""symbolism"" and every symbol was put in it's place for a certain reason, and this is exactly what makes me think about Nocturnal Animals as a piece of art. Also, the acting skills of Amy, Jake, Micheal and Aron were really outstanding! I loved many details in every character. The one and only negative point about Nocturnal Animals is that the novel written and sent by (Edward) missed the reality in some parts.

712,levi-82100,A riveting thriller with two interwoven stories.,8,2 January 2017,"Nocturnal Animals tells two stories at the same time, one set in the real world, where the main protagonist (Susan) receives a book written by her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gylenhaall), and a second story which follows the story of the book. The real world story is told in parallel with the book, where it is interrupted by flashbacks of Susan's relationship with Edward. The story of the book itself is a tough one, with the main character getting assaulted by a group of three men while on the road with his wife and daughter. What unfolds afterwards sets up an intense story that could be viewed as a separate film. However, what I found riveting about this film is that both the real life story and the one in the book parallel each other very well. Since Edward incorporates elements of his relationship with Susan, we get a good sense of how he views their relationship. This adds a lot to the film, as a standalone story, the book (titled Nocturnal Animals), would be a very good revenge drama, however, interwoven with the real life story of Susan and Edward's relationship, we get a much deeper insight into Edward's mind, and then, looking back at the book's story, we can see how it creates a statement on the real world events. The ending of the movie ends on a very precise note, and while I say this subjectively, it does end at the perfect spot, with the perfect tone.I've tried to exclude spoilers as much as possible from this review, so my apologies if you find it superficial, I would like to say that the movie is not easy to sit through (the book's story is pretty depressing), but, it offers two stories that complement each other very well, and let you think about how they affect one another.",Nocturnal Animals

Need to make a note that the acting was GREAT, by the way. A few big names in this and they all played their role very well. It was a fun watch but ... Unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere. And instead, turned into this sad, confusing mess which had no conclusion, explanation or closed ends in any way, shape or form. Only a cut off ending that left me annoyed and depressed.

714,sirlordbreakage,A movie requires more than one decent metaphor to hold its own for 2 hours.,4,5 January 2017,"I agree with a lot of people here who say this movie is undoubtedly one of the best looking movies of the year. It's probably no surprise coming from a director like Tom Ford, who was a fashion designer for Gucci before chasing filmmaking. This movie looks like a Gucci ad for the majority of its runtime and it's hard to fault him for having an impeccable attention to detail. Whether it's a closeup of Amy Adams' face or a wide shot of a deserted landscape, Ford certainly has a hell of an eye for a shot.It's too bad that that's all there is to this movie. If this film were made by a less talented director, it would probably be a Lifetime Channel movie, and for most of the duration it feels like one; one artfully directed Lifetime Channel movie with masterful acting, but even still, Lifetime-tier. It's a shame that such a talented cast couldn't help elevate this film above its mediocre script. There are some deviations from the norm, like the main character being rich and being the owner of an art gallery she doesn't care for (which I'll admit I found to be an interesting dynamic), rich and still having a good relationship with her ex husband (ish), there's a few more but that's the few I can name off the top of my head.Lots of people are claiming that this film is one complex masterpiece or whatever, but they couldn't be more wrong if they tried. The whole film is a metaphor for how awful divorce is, and problem is, it's so easy to tell, and it's all the movie has to exist on aside from a good performance from Amy Adams. It's clear from the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal plays both Edward (the ex husband) and Tony. Hell, the original book this film is based on is called ""Tony and Susan"". Susan basically reads this graphic and violent metaphor for how apparently horrible she is and feels bad about it. The metaphor is only communicated through the movie-within-the-movie to the point where the movie's actual plot is literally just... Amy Adams reading a book for 2 hours and feeling bad. That is literally her whole character arc. She reads a book and she feels bad. There is literally a scene where she looks at a live video on a co-worker's iPhone only to see the character in the novel that is supposed to be her jump at the camera lens. It's about as subtle as a brick to the face.Not just that but the film handles how apparently horrible she is so callously. In the book, the plot is that Tony lost his family when a man and his deranged friend captured them and raped and killed them. So uh... what did she do to ""rape and kill"" whatever he had? Oh right, she had an abortion. Because heaven forbid a woman should choose whether or not she wants to keep a child from a man she's no longer with. And what happens after she gets the abortion? If you guessed ""she feels bad"", congratulations, feel free to take a cookie. Seriously, I'm no feminist advocate or whatever, but the treatment of women in this film is so callous it's beyond belief. We get it, divorce is tough. We don't need a violent perfume ad disguised as a movie to remind us of that.When all is said and done, Nocturnal Animals is basically just a pretty looking A-list student film that thinks it's more clever than it really is. If this didn't have a master of aesthetic directing it, it would basically have just ended up as the Lifetime Network movie of the week it probably should have been. It's not offensively bad, it's just gorgeous mediocrity and a weak metaphor carrying a movie on fumes. It's like a bag of chips that's 80% air passing itself off as a full meal.",Nocturnal Animals

722,arteempauta,Nocturnal Animals Review,9,12 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is Tom Ford's second and most recent film. It is based on Austin Wright's ""Tony and Susan"" book. The film has in its cast Amy Adams, making the role of Susan Morrow; Jake Gyleenhaal, playing two characters Tony Hastings and Edward Sheffield, Susan's ex-husband; Michael Shannon is Lieutenant Bobby Andes and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ray Marcus.The film focuses on Susan Morrow, a wealthy art gallery owner, although she has a wealth of material possessions and a privileged social status, she has a sad and bitter life. Upon receiving a manuscript from a book written by her ex-husband, she begins to think about her past and the choices that made her get where she is today. Nocturnal Animals has three narratives, Susan's life in the present, the book's history, plus the flashbacks of her past. The connection between the stories is very subtle and quite interpretive.The narratives have quite different tones, while the story of the book is visceral and violent; Susan's life is opaque and lonely. The film, from the opening to the final sequence, is quite metaphorical. Even with all its symbolism, different stories, much due to the Tom Ford's work in the direction and in the script, the film manages to maintain a good pacing and tell an engaging story that makes the tension only increase over time. The director also prints his style in the use of the cameras producing in certain scenes a symmetrical aestheticism and having a distinct color palette for each narrative.Amy Adams has a strong performance, her character wants to convey the image of a strong and imposing figure, she does this with makeup. However, as she reads the book, we see how it affects her life, making her vulnerable. As she reads the story, her armor is gradually breaking. Jake Gyleenhaal has a great performance, in the character of ex-husband, Edward Sheffield, does not have many scenes, but as Tony Hastings, character of the book, he stands out.Michael Shannon plays a complex character and who is also going through a tragic and difficult moment in his life. His acting is unbelievable, he plays a rude character, but in certain moments also has to lower the guard, making himself vulnerable. The recognition of his work came with his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 2017. Who most surprised me was Aaron Taylor- Johnson playing Ray Marcus. The actor is unrecognizable and his acting was so good and convincing, that you feel repulsion when the character is on the scene.",Nocturnal Animals

They used all that money they spent, just to make the effing god awful scenes that they force you through all the more real and gut wrenching. If you are masochistic, you may~ like this. Otherwise, stay away. I'm an easygoing guy. I like almost every movie I watch. This is literally the first time I've ever felt about a movie: ""I will never get these two hours back.""

725,tjl-68789,Intriguing & thought-provoking,9,23 March 2017,"Potential spoiler ahead... I found this movie to be suspenseful and interesting to watch. Initially, slow to understand the purpose, a little bit of bouncing around between fact and fiction within the movie itself, but all makes sense in the end. I also found this movie to be both frustrating to watch and relatable at the same time in the sense that if I put myself in the main characters shoes, namely Jake Gyllenhaall's fictional character (and by fictional, I mean fictional within the movie). It makes you wonder what you would do in a situation of great stress and threat to your family. The ending is a bit of a ""choose your own adventure"" type of scenario. It leaves a lot of unanswered questions, but you are likely to form your own conclusion as to why it ended the way it did. It takes a little bit of thought, but it makes sense. After throwing a small temper tantrum at the end, I determined that the reason for the rather abrupt ending was self evident. Overall, I very much enjoyed the film, and it made me really think about what I would do if put in a similar circumstance, both on the fiction within the fiction side, and within the main characters of the movie. That said, I give it a solid 9 out of 10.Let me also add that this movie made me decide that if I ever go on a road trip with my wife and children, I'm going to either carry a gun, or a long metal object to defend my family!",Nocturnal Animals

This is not a terrible movie, because despite the run-time, it's barely a movie.It feels like an unfinished version of the film. It's like a long, long teaser that doesn't tell you anything, but gives you the mood of the story. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, but where's the story?It's a story in a story, but neither of them have enough of them to be interesting. Imagine Inception, a dream within a dream, but in it DiCaprio suffers from insomnia, so he makes himself some hot cocoa, reads a bit from some novel and sleeps. And then does that in the second layer. Am I exaggerating? A little. Replace hot cocoa with whiskey, replace novel with manuscript and that's what you get. Okay, the story in the novel has more substance, but it's just a generic rape- revenge story. There's no deeper meanings here. Family travel south. Get attacked by hillbillies. Then it's revenge. Why couldn't that be the whole story? Because it's not interesting enough. So is the story outside the novel interesting? No, not really. Two mediocre stories don't make a great story.It's more film school material than anything.",Nocturnal Animals

I still can not figure out why she takes roles in movies like this one.There is a chance I would like this movie if I was high, or maybe, drunk. But, sober, and with perfectly clear mind, I can not figure out what is going on in this ''piece of art''. There are not words to describe this.

730,craigcurlette,Well worth watching....if properly prepared!,8,2 May 2017,"I have never written a movie review before. I also had never heard of Tom Ford or Austin Wright. With that said I went into this movie totally unbiased and based on recommendation by co workers.After seeing the movie I decided to check out IMDb and see the quotes, goofs, trivia and whether it was a screen play or based on a book. From what I have found out about the book, the movie works closely with the overall theme of it.This time I also chose to read reviews about the movie. And there is such a wide range of opinion from no stars to ten stars with lots of both positive and negative reviews. For those who rated it negatively, based on their comments, I would think that they might not have understood the plot nor the subplot of the movie. You have to look deep within the movie and understand the plot and purpose of the film. No, it's not the best movie I have ever seen but based on Hollywood's overexposure of super heroes, science fiction and unrealistic fantasy plots they produce, this was a good, solid thriller that although might not have left me sitting on the edge of my seat, it did open my mind to see the subplots intended. I won't say much else because I could spoil it, but think closely about the characters and what they represented and think closely about the underlying messages within the story and enjoy the movie.This movie is an intellectual thriller and you must have a little higher intellect to really understand it.",Nocturnal Animals

732,patrickdeskur,"I'm shocked this movie was made in today's feminist, misandrist, leftist environment",10,7 July 2017,"After being deeply disappointed by ""Demolition"", I decided to give another Gyllenhaal movie a chance--""Nocturnal Animals"". I didn't expect much and knew nothing going in.And all I have to say is wow. I absolutely can't believe such an unapologetically masculine movie was made in 2016 and by a goddamn fashion director to boot.It just doesn't stop throwing real-world truths at you. Let's begin:1. Never try to turn a ho into a housewife. Susan is a slut from the start and even calls herself that. She initiates everything with Edward and invites him over to her place just like that. RED FLAG, men. 2. Hypergamy. Women will always try to ""upgrade"" if the opportunity arises, even if they've already got a good guy. Susan should be thrilled to have a guy like Edward for a husband. She's just a plain jane with regular features, while he's truly handsome. But she can't help but chase an even better looking guy who is successful, even though deep down she knows that such a playboy will never be faithful to her. Female nature exposed.3. Abortion. Susan aborts Edward's child. And she actually says ""HIS CHILD"" in the movie. Unbelievable in this day and age of ""my body my temple my fetus DGAF I do what I want you go grrrl"" feminist BS. 4. The role of a strong husband and father. Tony (the fictional character in the book written by Edward) is a weak coward and is clearly portrayed as such. Tony is unarmed. Tony doesn't fight back, can't fight, doesn't even know how to fight. A man should ALWAYS be prepared for the WORST CASE SCENARIO, ESPECIALLY when with his FAMILY. That means being ARMED and trained in basic fighting skills. The sheriff asks Tony if the men were armed. They weren't. He then asks him why he didn't approach them after they called out to him. Tony's lack of an answer speaks for itself--cowardice. How could a man live with himself after behaving in such a despicable manner? Better to die on your feet than live on your knees--a punk, a coward, a worm. The sheriff communicates as much to Tony by looking at him with pure contempt. And Tony exposes his true feelings towards the end of the film as he breaks down crying and blaming himself for everything. 5. The grotesque naked fat old women at the beginning mock the world of modern art, as they are part of an art exhibition. Modern art is grotesque, pretentious, ridiculous. As grotesque as those naked monstrosities. As pretentious and ridiculous as that art gallery worker and her smartphone. 6. Pro-gun and pro-vigilante justice. The sheriff is a very masculine and very likable character. He just DGAF. Breaks every rule in the book because he's certain about who is guilty. Guns down one piece of sh*t. Shoots him right in the back in cold blood. Then finishes him off. To hell with the liberal fat cats over in Washington. 7. Shockingly enough no characters of colour. No wise and all- knowing Morgan Freeman. No aggressive, racist and obnoxiously loud Sam L Jackson. No sexy Idris Elba second husband. Nothing but a white cast. How the hell did this get green lighted?8. A clear message to women. DO NOT BAT OUT OF OUR LEAGUE, or you will eventually end up being a miserable emotional wreck. Like Susan. 9. A clear message to men. FIGHT TO THE DEATH. Or you will be directly or indirectly responsible for the rape and murder of your women. And end up killing yourself or living the rest of your life psychologically castrated. Messages I disliked but could overlook due to the whole constantly spitting in the face of liberals:1. Short, needless conversation about Susan's gay brother. 2. Comical portrayal of Susan's mother. I don't know who told her to speak like Scarlett O'Hara, but the result was atrocious and affected. 3. The ""Republican"" reference for the plebs. Anyone who knows anything is fully aware that bankers are pulling the strings and parties and politicians mean nothing. Cinematography, lighting, music, acting (aside from Amy Adams, who just stares blankly) all on point.A true feast for the eyes, ears, mind and spirit.",Nocturnal Animals

It's always hunting, it is never satisfied. You can have everything and still feel that something is missing.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a Nocturnal Animal, she knows it, she feels it. Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) knows it too. This is the real matter of this film. The parallel story in Edward's novel, puts another Nocturnal Animal on the play, Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who represents in the most brutally way, the same actions taken for Susan Morrow.You can think is a Story about Revenge, but if you remember how difficult it is to see your worst side, inside you, maybe you can watch the movie as a kind of lesson. A lesson to be felt and to be learned, without any guarantee the people, the Nocturnal Animals, understand it - don't forget the final look of Susan, the expression on her eyes. We know she felt the lesson but, Did she really understand?.Wonderful movie, excellent Direction, every Performance was gorgeous. Marvelous Art Direction and Cinematography.If you want to learn how to detect Nocturnal Animals and some of their reasons... Watch this movie... Twice if you can or you bear it...",Nocturnal Animals
736,abstractrick,Reviewers are getting the ending wrong,8,23 September 2017,"The consensus amongst the reviewers here, and elsewhere, is that the last scene in the restaurant depicts Edward (1st husband) ""standing up"" his date, Susan (his ex). Everyone here is cheering on Edward for his sweet revenge. But that is not how it ended. You guys are wrong. Ed killed himself. Keep in mind, the film depicts updates on Susan's current day life with Gyllenhaal, while also depicting scenes from the book with the lead character, also being played by Gyllenhaal. This peculiar character coincidence is planned and helps to illuminate why Gyllenhaal (1st husband) doesn't show up for the date. It is because he killed himself in both story lines. Let's ask ourselves, why was Tom Ford was drawn to this story? Was it because of some ha-ha dating trick at the end of a script? No. It was for the brutal honesty of confronting one's mistakes and shortcomings that ultimately leads to an honor killing of self. Yes, dealing with suicide can be very uncomfortable. In fact, Ford depicts the event somewhat ambiguously, but if you rewind the tape you will see that Gyllenhaal doesn't accidentally shoot himself. It was a choice.Remember, Gyllenhaal is weeping at the end as he admits to those quick, yet monumental mistakes with the car chase, not defending his family, and then failing to keep the murderers subdued. Yes, he does kill the murderer on a 3rd chance, but after that justice is achieved, he ends his life as a self-punishment for the dishonor he brought to his family, self, and others. The cinematic beauty and talented acting deliver this message with raw beauty. Perhaps the Nocturnal Animals were more than just those backwoods road killers. Maybe Nocturnal Animals are the small failures in our quick decisions that give birth to animals that gnaw on us every night.",Nocturnal Animals

All of the actors were pretty impressive, IMO. Although I must admit that Michael Sheen was a bit... awkward? Still trying to figure out what the point of him was in the film. The very opening scene was a bit much for my personal taste and I have no idea where Mr. Ford was going with that exactly, but I have awarded this film 8 out 10 stars because I do believe whilst it has many moments of ""privileged"" people having basic life issues, there's also the reminder shown that money really can't buy you everything.. namely, love.",Nocturnal Animals

It's one of the best film i have seen in this year . Great performance by all the actors , fantastic imagery ,nice plot with a deep meaning and an extraordinary moral which every human can benefit from it in his life .
It looks like 80s masterpieces due to old clothes ..
True love comes once in lifetime , and we probably cannot get another chance to regret our mistakes and remedy our errors. 
I was really interested in how the producer could integrate two exciting stories in a one movie .. it creates a great work as a result ..
And i was extremely shoked by the last scene when the father kill the villain and revenge to her wife and her daughter , and susan's ex-husband didn't come and let her alone in the restaurant .
I really recommend the film to everyone because it's such a great exciting movie.",Nocturnal Animals
