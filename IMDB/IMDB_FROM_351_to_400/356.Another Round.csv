0,SnoopyStyle,dancing drunk Mads,7,2 June 2021,"Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) pines for his fun-loving hard-drinking youth. As an older man, he's a boring high school history teacher. His life has gone stale and his students hate him. After a night of heavy drinking, he and three other teachers decide to do rigorous drinking as an 'experiment'.Let me do the ending first. It's the big scene of the movie. I get the exuberance but I don't like the acrobatics. He's drunk, right? He can't be doing a dance number. At the same time, I get doing a dance to end the movie. Like the rest, I like the idea of it a little more than the actual thing. I like the concept of the experiment but if that's the case, they should exaggerate it by doing it scientifically. They would make up rules and keep careful logs. This is an interesting idea and it has the great Mads doing drunk acting. It's certainly an intriguing film.",Another Round
1,Kirpianuscus,teachers and their lives,9,29 June 2021,"Teacher being myself, I saw this film for a sort of cure after a crazy pandemic school year and, no doubts , for Mads Mikkelsen ( like Martin, I am history teacher and very/ too familiar with the parents/ students pressions ). The film was more then I expected. Because it is a beautiful eulogy of freedom and fine portrait of teaching - the help for Sebastian from music teacher is just moving - , friendship, escape from fears / doubts/ routine, middle age crisis, pure forms of freedom . And, sure, a film about fall. I saw it as teacher , not as cinema critic, I loved the crazyness and realism, humor and dark slices, the moral and the splendid job of Mikkelsen.",Another Round
2,Horst_In_Translation,Sobering movie,8,17 August 2021,"""Druk"" or ""Another Round"" is a Danish movie that premiered back in 2020 and now finally reached theaters here as well. And overall it was worth the wait I'd say. But first things first: The film is pretty much entirely in the Danish language and runs for slightly under two hours in the version I saw. The writer and director is Thomas Vinterberg and he made this film around the age of 50 and the man has been among Denmark's best filmmakers for quite some time now and this one here could very well propel him into the top spot. There has been a lot of quality from this little North European country in terms of movies lately, more than my country Germany can only dream of. This was one of the most lauded films this awards season. The movie was intended to be shown at Cannes first, but the pandemic got in the way. Otherwise, it would have been a huge contender there too. In any case, the film continues with its success greatly with all kinds of awards bodies, for example with a pretty much clean sweep at the European Film Awards and after Minari was not considered eligible for the foreign language category at the Oscars, there was pretty much zero doubt that this one takes the prize. Otherwise, it might have been a closer contest. Speaking of the Oscars, director Vinterberg himself was nominated here for his work behind the camera and that came as a bit of a surprise for sure. I would not call him undeserving, but I am also not sure if I think he was really deserving of that honor. Anyway, with Vinterberg there was a special story this awards season that is linked to death as well, namely when he lost one of his children under tragic circumstances. Not something that inspired this film though if I remember correctly. But still my sympathies to him.As for the cast, Danish movie fans will certainly know more cast members here than the average movie-goer, but that is perfectly fine. Everybody will of course recognize Mads Mikkelsen. He is the man you see on the poster with the bottle in his hand and he is also a star internationally, no matter if we are looking at Casino Royale, Hannibal or (soon) Fantastic Beasts. I like him quite a lot, so happy about his successes with this film here. He carried the movie nicely from beginning to end, is in most scenes and elevates an already pretty good screenplay. He does so much, even if he has little to work with. The best example for me was the scene in which he finds out about the idea of maintaining a certain blood alcohol level in order to feel better. The subtle moments there with him at the table were as good as the more obvious moments when he is the one to talk about everything that goes wrong in his life. Even his friends apparently do not take him seriously anymore, see him as some kind of victim as one of them talked to the others about something linked to his class and how the students were unhappy with his teaching and Mikkelsen's character apparently told him not to. Told him to keep it as a secret. Yet, as he finds out, he also does not act outraged. He just lets it all happen, does not stand up for himself. Another example would be the scene with all the students and parents present in which he also does not really defend himself. I mean one of the students left class while he was teaching because he was ""not up for it anymore"" or something. You see who's to blame here. Anyway, I did not want to jump this deep into the story yet, but let me also mention Thomas Bo Larsen, an actor that Vinterberg has worked with for decades now. Saw the film Festen a while ago and the two collaborated there as well. TBL's character and performance were also among the more notable aspects from this film for me and actually long before his character gained tragic relevance. He, just like the actors playing the other two friends from the quartet, was nominated for a Danish Film Award (Bodil), but managed to come short on the win in a Godfather scenario (vs. Joel Grey). Oh yeah, and for equality reasons, the actress playing the protagonist's wife was also nominated.This is a film that is really bittersweet at times. You may feel uncomfortable watching at times and feel a bit caught when you have scenes that seem initially kinda funny like how the men hide their alcohol, but in retrospective, if you know what happens later on and watch the film again, then you will perhaps not laugh anymore. Take Thomas Bo Larsen's character (the man reminds me a bit of Mickey Rourke somehow) and how he hides his alcohol in a water bottle while teaching physical education. This was also a good example already of how he was forced to lie when a boy wanted to drink something from his bottle. Or when the headmaster or who she is suspects the children of being responsible for the alcohol abuse and we know it's these four fully-grown men in fact. That was also kinda funny. Or when Mikkelsen's character runs against the wall because he had twice the intended amount of alcohol in his blood. What was definitely not funny anymore was Thomas Bo Larsen's character entering the room heavily drunk and visible for everybody. That reminded me of a statement from earlier from one of the protagonists' kids it was I think that sounded like something like how everybody knows that he is drinking. I kept wondering about that too. Could they hide it this well? Did really nobody say something or just did not want to say something. I mean people must have smelled it. And it is also debatable how the idea of giving a student alcohol before he takes an important oral exam is justifiable, even if it helped him pass. Which he would not have otherwise. Or at least not with the desired grade. Admittedly that scene felt a bit odd, like the question was really not so difficult that he could not have answered it correctly when sober.Other than such a scene here and there, this film had nice attention to detail. I think Vinterberg did especially well with parallels and how they were actually very tragic. Take the moment when we find out about one very young character peeing himself in bed and later on we have his father do the exact same thing because he was drunk. All self-control was gone. A second exemple I remember is the little boy I mentioned earlier with the water bottle and how he holds Thomas Bo Larsen's character's hand on one occasion. Later on, he is one of those holding the coffin that contains the corpse of his former football teacher. Really a tragic turn of events. The parallel I mentioned first also resulted in the man's wife/partner leaving him because she could not take it any longer. So romance relationships also play a major issue here. This also applies to Mikkelsen's character. His wife also leaves him. Maybe only temporary as we find out with these short messages towards the end, but still. We also see how he gets violent on one occasion. This is also not a matter of keeping it all secret, even if the men do, but we find out on several occasions that they are not really successful. One female character asks on one occasion in a mildly funny tone something like if they are drinking again. That felt pretty fitting. It's an inconvenient subject. On the one hand a basis for fun and feeling better, maybe even feeling something again at all as we see when he deals with his class with the alcohol in his blood for the first time there, on the other hand, something that can literally destroy everything. But nonetheless we also find out about the positive sides. The protagonist's wife also appreciates her man for the first time in years. They have great sex even. I still struggled with the way they presented her unfaithfulness here as if it is something that was justified in any way. Maybe I am not up-to-date anymore, but I think that you should always leave your partner before cheating on him.That is pretty much it. There are a handful of moments, especially in the first half, where the film almost feels fully as a comedy, but in retrospective it is not, even if it says so here on imdb. I mean it's still kinda funny how they do not get the fresh fish at the supermarket and, fully drunk then, joke about catching it from the water, even try to do so. Catch a crab and want to use it as bait for the fish afterwards. In any case, this is a film that will probably only really make you laugh on first watch. It gets a lot darker quickly. The shot you see on the poster is from the very end. It looks like fun. He is partying together with his students who now adore him (especially after the interesting ""who would you elect"" discussion), but the truth is that the ending could not be any more depressing. He fully gave in to his alcoholism now, could have lost his only shot at getting back together with his wife and when he jumps into the water, the water that should haunt him, fill him with grief because of what it did to his friend, he forgot about all of it in his drug-induced ecstasy. A shot that will stay in your mind for sure. This is when the closing credits roll in. The song (""What a Life"" by Scarlet Pleasure) played during this scene I really liked a lot. Fit the moment nicely as well. You can also hear it at the start with the youth partying again to an extent that has you wonder if it still feels right, especially the synchronous vomiting. Another pretty memorable parallel. I think this is one of the defining films on alcohol(ism) in the 21st century by now, even if I must say the gigantic awards attention feels a bit exaggerated. This review is by the way coming from somebody who experienced severe abuse of alcohol in his closest family too, even if it happened decades ago. I give it a thumbs-up and there was never any doubt for me if I could. A good film overall with great moments here and there. Just no excellence. Go check it out. October 2021: Upon rewatch, I decided to add another two stars as I liked it even more this time and I think this deserves to be included among the best films of 2020. (tt10288566)",Another Round
3,lee_eisenberg,booze on first,10,1 April 2021,"Thomas Vinterberg's Academy Award-nominated ""Druk"" (""Another Round"" in English) looks at the role of alcoholic beverages in our lives, with a group of friends trying to maintain a constant blood-alcohol level. It's not a pro- or anti-alcohol movie; it simply shows the role that alcohol plays; the naturalistic cinematography adds to the tipsy feeling. Managing to cleverly fluctuate between funny and serious, the movie hits all the right notes while never turning mean. I'll be eager to see Vinterberg's next effort.A real credit to Danish cinema.",Another Round
4,jboothmillard,Another Round,8,5 May 2021,"This Danish film (also titled Druk, which means ""binge drinking"") is one I found out about from Awards Season, the leading actor was a big draw for me, but it did also sound like an interesting story, from Oscar, BAFTA, and Golden Globe nominated director Thomas Vinterberg (Festen, The Hunt, Far from the Madding Crowd). Basically, teachers Martin (BAFTA nominated Mads Mikkelsen), Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), Peter (Lars Ranthe) and Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) are colleagues and friends at a high school in Copenhagen. All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and uneventful. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group discuss a theory by psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, that having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05 makes you more creative and relaxed. While the group dismisses the theory, Martin, who is depressed due to his marriage failing, is inspired and starts to drink at work. The rest of the group
eventually decides to join him, noting their experiences as an experiment to test Skårderud's theory. They agree to a set of rules: their BAC should never be below 0.05 and that they should not drink after 8:00pm. Within a short period of time, Martin, Tommy, Peter and Nikolaj find both their work and private lives more enjoyable. Martin particularly is delighted that he is finally managing to reconnect with his wife and children. The group find this positivity a reason to agree to take the experiment further, and the four increase the daily BAC limit to 0.10. Continuing to find their lives improved, the group decides to attempt binge drinking to observe how their bodies and minds respond. They all have a fun night, but after coming home drunk, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family express their worries that he is becoming an alcoholic, saying that he has been noticeably drunk for weeks. Martin and his wife Anika (Marie Bonnevie) have a heated argument, during which she admits to infidelity, and Martin leaves her. The group soon experience the negative consequences of the experiment and abandon it. Months later, all the members of the group have stopped drinking during the day except for Tommy, who has become an alcoholic. On day at work whilst drunk, Tommy boards his boat with his dog, he sails out on the ocean and dies in an accident. Following Tommy's funeral, the three remaining friends go out to dinner and are reluctant to drink the alcohol which is served. While dining, Martin receives a message from his wife who tells him that she is willing to give their marriage another chance. Martin, Peter and Nikolaj join the recently graduated students in celebrating and allow themselves to drink again while the partying takes place at the harbour. Martin, a former jazz ballet dancer, had for some time been urged by colleagues and refused to dance. In high spirits and influenced by the alcohol, Martin dances with the students and guests. His dance becomes increasingly energetic and joyous, and it ends as he leaps into the water, on a freeze frame of him in mid-air. Also starring Susse Wold as Rektor. Mikkelsen and his three co-stars give convincing performances as the drunken chums who find a new lease of life, their lessons whilst tipsy in the classroom and in the outdoors are fun to watch, with clever camerawork to capture the controlled inebriation and emotional moments, and it has both amusing and dramatic scenes that keep things moving nicely, a great comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it Golden Globe was Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!",Another Round
5,paul_haakonsen,Surprisingly good...,7,5 January 2021,"The 2020 Danish movie ""Druk"" (aka ""Another Round"") is actually well-worth watching, and I am not just saying that because I am Danish. But this movie definitely took me by surprise.Sure, the movie has Danish major league actors Mads Mikkelsen, Lars Ranthe and Thomas Bo Larsen on the cast list so that in itself was actually the first clue as to what kind of level of entertainment ""Druk"" was going to be. I can't claim to have been standing in line to get to watch ""Druk"" when it was out in the cinema, nor am I overly much of a fan of director Thomas Vinterberg in general. But ""Druk"" definitely turned out to be an entertaining movie.Not only does the movie have solid and powerful acting performances by the lead actors Mads Mikkelsen, Lars Ranthe, Magnus Millang and Thomas Bo Larsen, but it also had a very enjoyable and entertaining storyline, which turned out to be a rather accurate depiction of the Danish mentality towards alcohol in general. Sure, director Thomas Vinterberg managed to sneak in some sarcasm and jabs at the fairly laidback attitude towards alcohol, but it was done very nicely.And the characters in the movie were ones that you easily could identify with and relate to, so that definitely added a lot to the overall enjoyment of the movie.The storyline in ""Druk"" turned out to be much better than I had initially thought it to be, and on that account alone - for the storyline - I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch this 2020 movie, even if you are not able to understand the Danish language - subtitles exist for a reason!My rating of ""Druk"" settles on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",Another Round
6,CinemaSerf,"""Druk!"" - surely a letter missing?",7,14 September 2021,"As a 50-something man who worked in television for thirty-odd years, I wondered what all the fuss was about. So these gents have only just discovered what we've all known for aeons - a modicum of alcohol, administered responsibly and frequently enhances cerebral efficiency. No S**t Sherlock... Well, in this case these Danish teachers decide that their careers - and lives in general - are in need of a little pepping up, so they embark on an ostensibly ""scientific"" programme to measure enhanced (?) performance against increased blood alcohol levels. What ensues is a thoroughly enjoyable watch with a truly on-form Mads Mikkelsen and his colleagues pushing their new found challenge to the limits - challenging and compromising just about every relationship - both personal and professional - in their search for an improved life/career. As with most successful drama, the effects of their frankly reckless behaviour are exaggerated from time to time and the underlying dangers of their new-found philiopsphy are not ignored (well, not entirely, anyway) but this is essentially a feel good film that does touch on the effects of alcoholism and of addiction more generally, but is still a jolly enjoyable watch that allowed me to (s)wallow in a pre-kale smoothie nostalgia that facilitated a collegiate and collaborative way of working that has now, largely, gone the way of the dodo or zoom. I am certain that many in the medical profession will have many, many good reasons why this film may be irresponsible or guilty of glorifying alcohol, but it worked for me - and I think the last few scenes on the harbour are as joyous a piece of cinema as I've seen in a very long while. Skol!!",Another Round
7,grantss,"Great, original drama",8,6 September 2021,"Martin is a jaded history teacher. His relationship with his wife and family has also reached a point of staleness and his whole life seems to be one big bore. Similarly, his three best friends, teachers at the same school, have also reached a flat period in their lives. When one of them reads a theory that says that having a moderate degree of alcohol in your system at all times is a way to loosen up, they give it a go (for research purposes, of course!). It seems to work and they start upping the alcohol level. But what's the limit and what are the consequences?Great, interesting drama. Written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg who gave us such exceptional films as Festen / The Celebration (1998), Submarino (2010) and Jagten / The Hunt (2012) the plot is quite original and challenging. Covering a topic like excessive alcohol consumption and alcoholism and (on the surface) making it seem like a good thing is quite novel and sure to be confrontational and controversial, making for an intriguing journey.Ultimately it has to more nuanced than simply being a pro-alcohol drama, otherwise it would be pretty dull and predictable (think of The Hangover without the comedy, i.e. The Hangover II & III). It is more faceted than that, and some interesting twists and themes do develop, but saying anything more would give away the plot.Great performance by Mads Mikkelsen (but that's a given) and good supporting cast.Druk / Another Round deservedly won Best International Feature Film at the 2021 Oscars and Vinterberg got a nomination for Best Director.",Another Round
8,evanston_dad,"The Alcohol Version of ""Reefer Madness""",6,12 April 2021,"I'm not sure what on earth to make of this near ridiculous after school special about the dangers of alcohol.The point of the movie seems to be that drinking literally constantly in an effort to keep your blood alcohol level at a slightly elevated threshold is a bad thing. Well ok then. Glad we got that settled. Seriously, this film is like something you would have seen in the 1940s, when Hollywood decided that it was brave enough to acknowledge things like alcoholism. Wait, this movie WAS made in the 1940s, and it was called ""The Lost Weekend.""Mads Mikkelsen is a good actor, and he just about pulls off the overwrought material he's given here, but only just about. When the movie isn't wallowing in its ""Reefer Madness"" hysterics about alcohol consumption, it's wallowing instead in the mid-life crises of a bunch of well off white men, and I just. Didn't. Care.This is not the first Danish film to leave me befuddled, and I've actually been to Denmark twice and have close Danish friends. But this is the third Danish film after ""The Hunt"" and ""A Hijacking"" that has left me scratching my head and thinking, ""Huh?"" There are clearly some cultural differences that I simply don't fully understand.Grade: B.",Another Round
9,ferguson-6,"if a little is good, is more better?",8,24 April 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Language Film (Denmark), its director, Thomas Vinterberg was also nominated for Best Director. Mr. Vinterberg also directed the excellent 2012 film, THE HUNTING, and this time out, he collaborates yet again with his co-writer and lead actor from that film: Tobias Lindholm and Mads Mikkelsen, respectively.Mikkelsen (already one of the few must-watch actors) stars as Martin, a married man, father of two, and history teacher. His long-time friends include Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), a PE coach; Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) a Psychology instructor; and Peter (Lars Ranthe), the music teacher. The buddies are chatting over dinner as they celebrate Nikolaj's 40th birthday, and they come to realize they are each floating through life - in a mid-life crisis of sorts, neither happy nor sad. It's at this point where Norwegian Psychiatrist Finn Skarderud's hypothesis is discussed. They agree to test Skarderud's theory by maintaining a .05% Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), even while teaching.Almost immediately, the men each feel mentally sharper, more engaged, and awakened to their lives. Martin re-connects with his wife, Anika (Maria Bonnevie), and becomes a history teacher that inspires students ... quite a change from the complaints he had been receiving. The accomplishments of Hemingway and Churchill are discussed, as if alcoholics need role models. And then, to push a good thing even farther, the men decide if .05% works, why not take it to .10%? Well that's what the men do, and of course, the results aren't so great - ranging from upsetting to tragic.Is it possible to re-discover a life that's being wasted in self-pity or a state of numbness? Can alcohol jolt one back to life after the loss of youth and the reality of adult responsibility? Mid-life crisis has been addressed in many films, and alcohol is often part of the story ... think SIDEWAYS (2004). We learn here that the Danish culture involves heavy drinking, and in Denmark, there is an extraordinarily high rate of teenage drinking.The film is well acted, and Mikkelsen is terrific. Vinterberg dedicated the film to his daughter Ida, who was scheduled to appear in the film before dying in a car crash. He strategically includes Kierkegaard's quote about life being lived forwards, but only understood backwards, and that truly is the crux of what the men are experiencing. The final scene is extraordinary and unexpected, as Mikkelsen wows with an interpretative and energetic dance to ""What a Life"" by Scarlet Pleasure. What a life, indeed.

10,morrison-dylan-fan,0.05%.,7,13 August 2021,"After finding The Hunt (2012-also reviewed) to be superb,I been very interested in catching the latest project by the makers. Discovering that the film was being screened at my local Odeon for just one night,I decided to go up to the bar and buy a round.View on the film:The lone figure sitting at the table stone cold sober, Mads Mikkelsen gives an excellent performance as Martin, who sits silently as Mikkelsen casts across his face the absolute drained out state of Martin's life, whilst Thomas Bo Larsen brings out a great bohemian warmth to Tommy's rough-edge friendship with Martin.Dedicating the film to his daughter Ida after she died just four days into filming, (Ida was originally going to co-star in the movie) co-writer/(with Tobias Lindholm ) directing auteur Thomas Vinterberg & Victoria (2015-also reviewed) cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grovlen pour a pint out straight from Vinterberg's Dogme 95 roots, with harsh natural lighting caught in sparse close-ups on the descending drunken state of the friends.Bringing an underlying bitter sweet after taste to the mood, Vinterberg unveils cracks of brightness through the brittle naturalistic appearance, with wonderfully staged singing and dancing sequences, (a recurring motif in Vinterberg's work) which whilst appearing to be sunny, also subtly stage the impression in the final shot,of Martin following Tommy off the deep end at sea.Encouraged by his daughter to adapt a play he had written into a script, the screenplay by Vinterberg (and Tobias Lindholm) sadly never fully departs from the stage-bound roots, via the limited locations and number of characters who get involved in this drunken spiral.Sipping into the drinking experiment of his friends, the writers gradually have Martin become engulfed in an uncontrollable urge to delve deeper into the drinking culture his friends are fully submerged in,as Martin orders another round.",Another Round

13,MOscarbradley,This could be Vinterberg's best film to date.,9,21 February 2021,"Most films that deal with the demon drink have been po-faced manifestos on the dangers of alcohol and there are very few films that celebrate drunkeness and those that do usually do so for comic effect. Thomas Vinterberg's ""Another Round"" is something of a rare exception. It's a film about drinking to excess that's indeed both funny and tragic in equal measure as it explores the theory that we all seem to have a blood alcohol level that is 0.05% too low and that we should drink enough, during daylight hours at least, to raise it to that level, where 'psychologically' we should all be at our best.The protagonists are four Danish school teachers at the same school who decide to test this hypothesis with mostly disasterous results; like all good drinkers they either forget when to stop or simply choose not to. But Vinterberg's film isn't so much about the alcohol as it is about four sad men whose lives have stagnated and who find that drinking actually makes them happy in ways that sobriety never could. It doesn't hold back on the dangers but neither is it an outright condemnation. Ultimately this is a character study with alcohol a supporting player, albeit a major one.It's also superbly acted and in particular by Thomas Bo Larsen as the sports teacher who really doesn't know when to stop and by Mads Mikkelsen, in what might be a career-best performance, as the history teacher caught in a failing marriage and it's Mikkelsen who delivers the film's coup-de-theatre, performing a remarkable dance sequence at the climax that could just earn him an Oscar nomination. ""Festen"" not withstanding, this might also be Vinterberg's best film to date and, as predicted, if does win the Best International Film Oscar it will, indeed, be a worthy winner.",Another Round
14,dromasca,not only about drinking,9,12 February 2021,"There are two different films in 'Another Round' (the Danish title is 'Druk' which Google translates as 'Excessive Drink'), Thomas Vinterberg's 2020 film. One is about alcohol, its positive and negative effects, and how drinking is an integral part of the social life and culture of the community and perhaps of an entire people. The other is about a midlife crisis of four high school teachers who have each, in their own ways, come to a standstill in their personal and professional lives. Can alcohol be a solution? Up to what blood alcohol level? Can the morning after hangover be avoided?
The heroes of the film are four teachers from a Danish provincial town. Drinking seems to be part of the local culture and daily life, in a country where high school students drink countless beers at social events and where the scandals caused by them when under influence are regarded with indulgence as youth outbursts. Even teachers do not avoid the liquors, and even philosophers seem to propose a blood alcohol level of 0.05% as normal. The four teachers begin a 'psychological test' of living and exercising their teaching profession in conditions of permanent alcoholism. The results seem very positive for a while. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), the history teacher we will be following most closely, regains the class's attention and inspires students' interest in the subject he is teaching. Even his private life seems to return to a better forgotten path lost due to routine. The music teacher urges the students in the choir to listen to each other and to put their soul into the music they sing. The sports teacher motivates his football team and turns the spectacled boy intimidated by his colleagues into a scorer. Finally, the psychology teacher finds ways to help the terrified student facing final exams. Problems arise as the experiment progresses, alcohol doses increase, and inevitably, the negative effects of alcohol occur, including the tough waking up in the mornings after nights of excessive drinking. But are these changes just because of alcohol or at all because of alcohol? Maybe drinking is just a pretext to overcome the inherent crises of the professional routine, family, or life in general?
The script has sensitivity and subtlety and avoids the pitfalls of extremes. 'Another Round' is neither a plea in favour nor a moralising story against alcohol consumption, although I can guess that Danish viewers in particular have an opportunity to reflect on the role and place of drinking in their society. The study of characters is underlined by the extremely nuanced acting interpretation, especially of course the one of Mads Mikkelsen who adds another special role to his career and collaborations with Thomas Vinterberg. I was also impressed by the cinematic technique imagined by the director and cinematographer. The camera, fixed at the beginning, acquires mobility as the story progresses (along with the increase in alcohol levels) to become chaotic in times of crisis and later broaden the perspective and change the brightness towards the end. The confrontation of each of the heroes with the experiment is different and the outcome is not happy for everyone. Social drama and psychological study, a subtle and ostentatious story about middle age and school, teachers and students, 'Another Round' ends with an unexpected tone of optimism. Highly recommended - one of the most beautiful movies of this very special season.",Another Round
15,Cineanalyst,Neither Intoxicating Nor Sobering,6,27 March 2021,"Not to play into the trap of basing my evaluation of a movie on expectations, but I did hope for something more substantial given its high acclaim, including an unusual Best Directing Oscar nomination for Thomas Vinterberg, to go along with its International Film nom, the latter of which it'll likely win. I also find it odd that the title, ""Druk,"" is called ""Another Round"" in English, which has a celebratory ring to it, but literally translates to ""Binge Drinking,"" with its obviously more negative connotations. Appropriately enough, then, ""Druk"" manages a balancing act, wobbly though it may be, between those two interpretations. It's not a maudlin lecture on the dangers of the devil's drink, nor some crapulous Hollywood-type celebration of alcoholism (say, ""Old School"" (2003)). It lies passed out somewhere in between, tipsy in its veering one way or another variously, but ultimately avoiding the fate of more insufferable drunkards.But for naught it would seem, or at least nothing more than another mid-life crisis, male bonding flick--an entire genre I, for one, could do without, although I'm sure I would've enjoyed it more if I were drinking, too.... Anyways, Mads Mikkelsen carries the movie. None of the other characters are remarkable, and one hardly cares about the students for which the drunk teachers oversee their education. The supposed research paper they plan to write of their experience and its flimsy philosophical grounding is a scientifically-slapdash joke to begin with. Personally, though, I have no doubt some could perform better, especially simple tasks easier than driving, such as high-school teaching, while intoxicated. I assume some of my teachers were day drinkers, or at least I doubt they'd be any worse at their jobs had they been, but that's neither here nor there.There's enough here to like, however, to make for a fairly entertaining picture, if hardly life affirming or any other such thing that it's been advertised as. Mikkelsen is a fine actor with a handsome face. There are funny moments. We do eventually get to see Mikkelsen show off those dance moves, and the camera does well to follow along. It's the same for the movie, I suppose, as it's for the marital advice the friends share, about the little things making the difference.One of them that especially stood out to me were the text messages. It seems that cinema still hasn't quite figured out how to visualize texting on screen, let alone depict a human race that's increasingly paralyzed by constant phone staring. Put away the phones, as the lecturer must recite every class. Regardless, this features the best solution to the problem I've yet seen, and the protagonist steps away to check his texts instead of insulting his friends with his distracted glowing face. Text merely appears upon an otherwise black screen. Simple and elegant, and it also reminds me of how silent films handled communication in the first place. Get me ""Druk"" any day over that Emoji-vomit sequence in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (2018) and all the movies in between that can't figure out how to integrate text without it being a nuisance. A rare case of drinking and texting being a good idea.",Another Round
16,gbill-74877,"Well made, but misses",6,7 July 2021,"This film from Thomas Vinterberg is well made with good performances, but it weirdly suffers from being both predictable (drinking too much inevitably leading to negative consequences) and from glamorizing alcohol use (for both kids and middle-aged men). You could say that's a good thing, that a black and white view is not presented, or that it accurately reflects Danish culture, but it just seemed kind of off, or in any event, it wasn't very compelling to me. I liked the score with its interesting mix of songs, and Mads Mikkelsen's dance moves. Overall, though, I didn't think it was particularly honest about the experiment the teachers embark on or the main character's trajectory, with that joyful ending. It seemed like it wanted to have it both ways, and would have been better remaining a dark statement on the culture of drinking, from adolescence through adulthood.",Another Round

Thus, they decide to experiment by keeping the balance and drinking ever day to increase the blood alcohol to this level.

Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Bo Larsen both starred in the excellent 2012 film 'The Hunt', and in a way this almost felt like a prequel to that film due to them once again playing friends, and Mikkelsen again starring as a teacher.

24,howard.schumann,The answer to all of life's riddles lies at the bottom of a bottle.,7,9 March 2021,"Taking risks and taking responsibility can be two sides of the same coin but never seem to mesh in Thomas Vinterberg's (""Far from the Madding Crowd"") comedy-drama Another Round, Denmark's submission for Best Foreign Film at the 2021 Oscars. Written by Tobias Lindholm (""The Hunt"") and Vinterberg, the premise of the film lies in a dubious theory ascribed to Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud who asserts that the blood-alcohol content of all human beings is always too low, a 0.05% blood-alcohol content deficit. People would be far more engaged and energetic, he argues, if they maintained a level of 0.10%. In other words, the answer to all of life's riddles lies at the bottom of a bottle.Vinterberg is willing to give the theory a test drive, ""We've seen so many movies about how alcohol kills people,"" he says, ""but there's a reason a lot of people drink. It can make you fly."" One is tempted to recall the old adage that if God wanted people to fly, he would have given them wings. Willing and eager to test this theory, however, are four middle-aged teachers in a public high school whose zest for life has faded like the afternoon sun: History teacher, Martin (a craggy-faced Mads Mikkelsen, ""Arctic""); PE teacher and soccer coach, Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen, ""The Wave""); music teacher, Peter (Lars Ranthe, ""Hunting Season""); and psychology teacher, Nikolaj (Magnus Millang, ""Heavy Load""), all with seemingly nothing to give their lives true meaning in spite of having advantages that three-quarters of the world's population would beg for.The film begins with a fun drinking game and ends with more drinking fun, but there's a world of pain in between. Vinterberg coaxes excellent performances from his four leading men and we root for them. At the beginning of the experiment which includes drinking while at work during the day, results appear to be 95% effective, though they will soon require a booster shot. Martin, whose history lessons have ranged from dull to comatose, achieves liftoff after a few drinks and engages his students in a fun game of choosing which one of three unnamed people make better role models, the heavy drinkers: Churchill and Hemingway, or the vegetarian, non-drinker Adolf Hitler.For the students in this incongruously small class, Hitler seems to be the obvious choice, one that allows Martin to make the point that the world does not always meet our expectations. Peter inspires his choir to sing from the heart. Tommy instills confidence (and some hitherto unseen soccer skills) in a diminutive youngster known not so endearingly as ""Specs,"" while Nikolaj handles an anxiety-ridden student with tact and understanding, and his dead-on-arrival marriage to Amalie (Helene Reingaard Neumann, ""The Command"") also becomes revived. Each man responds to the experiment in different ways but the warm friendship and camaraderie of the four men remains constant.Eventually, they decide that if a little alcohol can work such wonders, why not try a little more? Layers of sadness soon bubble up and the men are forced to reevaluate how much satisfaction they have been experiencing in their relationships and in their jobs. As the amount of drinking increases, however, so does the downward spiral and the loss of a job by one teacher after he was caught staggering and mumbling in school. At home, Martin virtually ignores his two sons while his wife Anika (Maria Bonnevie, ""Becoming Astrid"") works at night. He asks Anika if she thinks he's a bore, a characterization the viewer has long since concluded in the positive. Her reply that ""you are not the same person that I once knew"" is hardly surprising and the passive and affectless Martin cannot raise enough emotion to tell her that he is leaving, except for a few sudden outbursts of anger on his way out the door. There are more traumas to follow, but overall Vinterberg makes drinking quite an acceptable way to bond and enjoy yourself without the word alcoholism ever coming up.While Another Round examines the tug of war between celebrating life and acting irresponsibly, the film's message is ambiguous. Vinterberg says that he and Lindholm ""deliberately avoided having a message."" The film he asserts is, ""a survey and exploration not only of alcohol usage but of the uncontrollable. It is just a catalyst for talking about being inspired in life."" I guess drinking can be a wonderful thing unless it destroys your life and that of those around you. ""You find a lot of AA people in the cinemas who feel they've been betrayed,"" Vinterberg says, ""They've seen how bad it can go, and it's an interesting open end, I guess."" Do tell.",Another Round
25,SAMTHEBESTEST,It could have been a Path-Breaking film on Alcohol culture but it opts to play safe with the general theories.,7,27 April 2021,"Another Round (2020) :
Brief Review -It could have been a Path-Breaking film on Alcohol culture but it opts to play safe with the general theories. Another Round is a great story by the way, but only if you look at those attractive elements. Rest, it has the same typical old-school-drama on Life. The use of alcoholism was never done like this and that's where the film interests you and at one moment it begins to look like a path-breaking film only to follow the mainstream theories of personality development and acknowledgement of rediscovering that lost joy in busy lifestyle. Four friends, all high school teachers, test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood. With the solid reference of Psychiatrist Finn Skårderud's theories it looks a magnificent idea and till the intermission point it works very impressively too. However, the second half goes to follow the general theories of life such as family issues like parenthood, relationship blunders, extramarital affair and all, along with the typical boring regretful speeches and bla bla. See, it looks uninteresting as hell. I mean, we have seen the same stuff again and again over the years and more effective too, then why the hell this would be path-breaking story falls into the same gutter? That's the last freaking mistake one could have done and unfortunately it is done here. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is worthy enough to grab your attention. Especially, the cinematic brilliance of Vinterberg and fantastic performance of Mads Mikkelsen very well supported by Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe and Magnus Millang. Some scenes in the film are simply amazing while some are typically outdated.

Even though the film is a little bit of an ensemble cast, he is undoubtedly the star of the film. He has the most screen time and his acting is light-years beyond the rest of the cast. We know him as the very quiet and under-stated man he plays in most of his films, and that is what he starts the movie as, but then when he is required to become more out-going as the film goes along is when we see his acting chops come to the front.The movie does give a reasonably balanced opinion on the subject matter. It starts out only really showing the positives, which I found to be quite a dangerous notion. However towards the end it makes a point of showing the negatives that would ultimately come from such a thing. I'm not entirely sure what this film is going to inspire people to do however. It really could go either way depending on the person.The film has some nice character touches, like the way one of them interacts with a glasses-wearing child.

From the start I felt like a vicarious Cassandra watching 'Another round' - yet deeply uncomfortable as it is at points, this is a rather entrancing movie, more than I expected.I like Mads Mikkelsen, and think he's a fine actor, but I'm not on board with the sense of fandom that has come to surround his career. Despite the accolades this picture has garnered, the basic premise as described on any given website didn't strike me as a feature I'd enjoy - many movies have already been made about drinking, and none have particularly curried my favor. So I find myself ever more surprised that I've enjoyed this one.The varied elements of 'Another round' are familiar, and maybe a bit tired as tropes, but this is a case where the sum is greater than its parts. This is a movie about middle-aged men, teachers struggling in their personal and professional lives and seeking renewed vigor. Deciding to partake in a social experiment, they begin a steady course of alcohol consumption as a means to better themselves.Director Thomas Vinterberg pointedly captures every alcohol-soaked reverie and sullen downturn the picture takes, with a keen eye lets the viewer vividly feel every beat. The cast is more than up to the task, bringing Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm's screenplay to life very believably. I'm particularly pleased, too, with the editing; the intermittent use of title cards to cheekily boost the narrative, or display text messages on a stark black background, is a fine film-making choice. The end result is - dare I say - intoxicating.The outcome of the film for each character isn't especially surprising, nor the ultimate theme that's laid bare by a student during final exams. Yet by the time this last leg of the movie rolls around, we're well on board with the story being told, and enraptured with the performances. The ending is pleasantly heartfelt, emotional without becoming overly sentimental, and a perfect capstone to a feature that works its way under your skin.I began watching with mixed expectations, and they were well exceeded. I need to correct myself, even - I think I can say this movie has made me a fan of Mads Mikkelsen in a way I wasn't before.

Now, renamed amore comforting Another Round for worldwide audience appeal, the film's positive point of view about alcohol consumption seems to simplify this addiction issue to a dangerous degree. The entire premise, that alcohol becomes a real confidence booster, seems so politically incorrect and far-fetched, despite the fine acting on display.Four teachers (Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, and Lars Ranthe) are caught in a mid-life crisis, unhappy with their lives and decide to conduct their own scientific experiment. Following a psychiatric theory that all humans need some alcohol in their systems to become more creative, they let the drinking games begin to loosen up their inhibitions and allow themselves to become better educators. Perimeters to this experiment are set (no drinking after 8 pm like Hemingway and staying within the 0.5 safety range). And voilé! Once dull and somber instructors, the quartet are suddenly transformed into exciting professionals in the classroom. Of course, no one immediately around senses their inebriation, none of the other unhip teachers or their family members. And, of course, the group slowly bends their own rules and increases their alcoholic ways to disastrous results. Such are the best laid plans.The screenplay by Tobias Lindholm and the director deals with the country-wide drinking problem in Denmark that affects young and old alike. But the storytelling is contrived and confusing. The teachers' motives and actions remain suspect. As they eventually go on their predictable bender with no real consequences, credibility is completely lost. One begins to question the immortality and selfishness of their behaviors and the overall logic of their philosophical study. (One teacher actually advises a student to consume alcohol before and during a test. Another encourages youthful drinking games as a coming-of-age adventure. At that point, this teetotaler wondered when parental uproar or administrative observations would occur. It doesn't. No intervention or job losses. Hard to believe.)Still, the actors are superb, especially Mr. Mikkelsen as Martin. He carry his character's burden internally and erupts with a vengeance when his intake level is fully sated. His final scene is quite memorable and a joyous celebration as his dancing skills are showcased. But just what is the message moviegoers are to take with them? Alcoholism can be fun?Another Round is a cinematic hangover without the humor. The thinking throughout Mr. Vinterberg's well-made film is cloudy and lacking in good judgment. It's a creative buzzkill. (GRADE: C+)",Another Round
37,pc95,One of the Best Movies of 2020/2021,8,3 July 2021,"Danish ""Druk"", directed deftly by Thomas Vinterberg, is a strongly entertaining commentary on Danish drinking. Mads Mikkelsen shows again why he's Denmark's premier actor with an emotionally complex and strangely painful journey of a man in his ""mid-life"" crisis that endeavors to embrace alcohol. There's something reminiscent of the British ""Full Monty"" here reflected in ""Druk"" - Monty was a lovely movie over 20 years earlier - ""Druk"" has similar story patterns and camaraderie between its characters. While ""Full Monty"" was about economic woes, ""Druk"" goes more beneath the surface and deals with complex emotional problems brought upon by taxing work and family time tug-of-wars. Alcohol seems to strangely save the day to start, although we know where this is leading, as there is always a control issue on the horizon blurring the lines between alcohol dependency and responsible drinkingl There doesn't seem to be an answer, and Vinterberg may not be looking for one. Further it may be an examination into ills, benefits, but indeed pervasiveness. Great drama with well mixed in comedy. 8/10.",Another Round

40,arungeorge13,Mads Mikkelsen is undoubtedly one of the finest actors of our times! [+73%],7,16 December 2020,"Another Round is a film that's equal parts fizzy (pun intended), poignant, and hard-hitting. Mads Mikkelsen comes up with yet another tremendous performance, ably supported by Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe, and Magnus Millang (who play high-school teachers and friends). Their teaching careers and personal lives are going through a lull and when one of them suggests that maintaining a certain % of alcohol in their systems could help revive both, the others quickly buy into the idea.That the story takes place in Denmark, a country with a unique drinking culture, only helps. Alluding to a wacky theory from Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud that the blood-alcohol content in humans is always too low, the quartet begins ingesting alcohol into their systems before their classes. This yields short-term positive changes in themselves and their students. However, the inevitable tragedies associated with drinking soon follow suit. Director Thomas Vinterburg (who co-writes with Tobias Lindholm), however, doesn't push viewers into total darkness. Another Round shows us how drinking could likely wreck lives, careers, and more but done in a controlled fashion, that mild high could do these folks some good.Yet, it isn't a film that goes all the way in what it tries to profess. When the drinking gets cathartic and it starts to affect each of the four guys differently, Thomas Vinterburg rushes to the 'safe storytelling' zone. Even if that's the case, Another Round has one of the most enjoyable climaxes in recent memory, with a drunk Mikkelsen pulling some crazy moves. Mikkelsen's performance is, in fact, what holds the film together especially during its drab middle portions. As a performer, he doesn't hit one false note, adding much-needed emotional heft to the plot. Also, I wouldn't see that scene, where Peter tells a nervous student to down a few shots before his viva voce, anywhere else.

The lightness of touch of both script and direction belayed it serious undertones and conjectured that middle age can bring on a re-evaluation of where you have arrived in life and the conclusion of this an lead to a potential life crisis.ThemesThe juxtaposition of the students at the beginning of their lives emphasised the jaded and stale reality of the teachers at their time of life.That life crushes you slowly by degree until you are a pale shadow of the person you were or indeed wanted to be.The observation that alcohol removes inhibitions and the ""real"" you emerges to stalk the earth.The side effect of alcohol is a heightened emotional connection to reality.The teachers experimented with alcohol to assist in bringing back their ""better selves"", however with the death of their friend, partially due to alcoholism, did they realise the role of alcohol in their lives and that it doesn't need to be all or nothing.Did the movies arrive at conclusions, no, but it thoroughly enjoyed the investigation of the hypothesis.

43,Jeremy_Urquhart,"An entertaining, funny, and sometimes emotional film that should (hopefully) appeal to a wide audience",8,30 December 2020,"I can't remember too many other high profile foreign films from 2020 off the top of my head, but Another Round surely has to be a contender for at least the Best Foreign Film Oscar. Nominations for the screenplay and Mads Mikkelsen's performance would also be well-deserved.Another Round takes an entertaining and unbiased look at the effects of alcohol: the good, the bad, and the messy, as well as the variety of ways different people can react to similar quantities of the world's favourite legal drug. It tackles this without feeling preachy as well, which was appreciated. It's not as harrowing as other films that deal with more illegal substances and their effects, but there are a few genuinely emotional moments that hit pretty hard in the story's second half.The more serious moments are balanced well with a good amount of comedy, as the film is pretty funny at times. The wide range of emotions and tones help highlight just how well-written and balanced the screenplay is, and how skilled its lead actors are (especially, as mentioned before, Mads Mikkelsen, who steals the show here and honestly can do no wrong as an actor, as far as I'm concerned).It starts a little slow, but picks up nicely 20 minutes or so in, and feels extremely well-paced from there until the end. Perhaps a couple of events within the narrative happen slightly too fast, and the film's visuals - while good - don't make quite the same impression as the writing or acting, barring a few striking images in the film's final third.Overall, I really liked this one, and I'm giving it one of those 4/5 ratings that's actually very close to a 4.5/5. I think we need more straightforward, unpretentious, quite accessible foreign films like this (and something like last year's Parasite) to increase the popularity of world cinema, and help convince non-believers that not every film in a language other than English is obscure or ""weird"" or overly artsy.I mean, the more arthouse stuff can be engaging in its own way, but hopefully you know what I mean- movies like this one could get people more invested in films made beyond their borders, and in the overall scheme of things, that can't be anything but good for film industries worldwide.",Another Round
44,bankofmarquis,"Interesting, but the ending did not resonate",6,21 April 2021,"Films have a tendency to fall on one of 2 sides when their subject matter is drinking, partying and alchoholism - (1) ""They're just a bunch of partying fun people"" or (2) ""They're drinking to cover up emotions they don't want to deal with and, eventually, it will lead to their ruin"".Danish Director Thomas Vinterberg was the surprise Oscar nominee for his direction in the film ANOTHER ROUND (a film he also co-wrote) as he attempted the noble feat of straddling these two sides.And...the result is an admirable attempt that falls just shy of being good.Starring the great Mads Mikkelsen (the villain in the first DR. STRANGE film), ANOTHER ROUND tells the tale of 4 Danish High School teachers who are stuck in a rut (call it a mid-life crisis) and come up with the idea of being slightly drunk all of the time to elevate their lives.The first half of the film flirts with ""Frat Boy Party"" territory as the 4 friends embark on the quest to see if staying slightly drunk elevates them. The results are quite mixed with moments of joy and triumph mixed in with some cringe-inducing moments. But then Vinterberg mines the ""dark side"" of alcoholism and the film takes a dark - and more interesting turn - only to have another turn at the end that just didn't work for me.Mikkelsen, of course, is quite good in the central role of Martin - the family man in mid-life depression crisis that kicks into ""Frat Boy"" mode when drinking ""just enough"". His character switches back and forth between these 2 modes and Mikkelsen handles these changes like the terrific actor that he is.His 3 friends played by Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe and Thomas Bo Larson are all equally depressed and switch back and forth right along with Martin. Unfortunately, none of these 3 have the ""it"" factor of Mikkelsen, so are really kept in his shadow - with the possible exception of a few moments by Larson.This is the first film I have seen from Vinterberg, but what I have read about him is that this film pretty much sums up his career. An interesting idea, told fairly well with an ending that doesn't really land. And that's what I thought of this film. I'm glad I saw it, but it will fade after a time, as the ending just didn't provide enough depth to keep ANOTHER ROUND with me for long.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Another Round

It's worth a shot!,8,30 June 2021,"After giving the most emotional and heartbreaking Oscar speech of the recent awards, Thomas Vinterberg's International Feature winner is now in UK cinemas. ""Druk"" (Danish for ""Binge Drinking"") is in the Danish language with subtitles: but don't let that put you off.Positives:
Mads Mikkelsen delivers a stunning performance. He really delivers the goods. He was nominated for a BAFTA for the role but missed out on the Oscar nomination. This feels unjust. I would have personally swapped out Steven Yeun for this performance by Mads.Thomas Vinterberg was justly nominated for Best Director at both the BAFTAs and the Oscars. The movie never lacks momentum from beginning to end. I was thoroughly entertained.It's quite unusual to see a 'buddy movie' concerning a group of men that's not a cop film. My wife described it as a '""chick-flick for blokes"". I guess you need to go to ""The Hangover"" films to find an equivalent. (That of course also centres around alcohol. Are we really that shallow?!)Negatives:
Up until a ""church scene"", I thought the story was well-structured and coherent. But I'm not quite sure what message the finale of the movie was trying to send. Yes, it's fun and full of energy. And Mikkelsen's dancing is both bizarre and entertaining. But given all that's gone before, is it a ""what the hell, life is for living and alcohol is part of that"" statement? I was unsure.Summary Thoughts on ""Another Round"": The movie is dedicated to ""Ada"" - Vinterberg's daughter, who was supposed to be acting in the film but tragically died in a car crash just four days into shooting. (Hence his emotional Oscar acceptance). The fact he managed to finish the movie at all is amazing. But the fact it's so good is a great memorial to her.It's billed as a ""comedy drama"" but, although there are comic moments, it leans heavily on the ""drama"". The Scandinavians in general tend to drink as much, if not more, than the British do. So this is a reminder of both the benefits and risks of the evil drink.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook or the Tiktok channel onemannsmovies.

48,tonypeacock-1,Choose life not alcohol,9,8 July 2021,"Danish/Swedish co-production from director Thomas Vinterberg starring Mads Mikkelsen best known to mainstream filmwatching audiences as characters such as James Bond villain Le Chiffre in Casino Royale (2006) as well as collaborating in a previous Vinterberg film with great success, The Hunt (2012).The premise is slightly exciting based on a factual idea from a Norweigan psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, that humans naturally have a blood-alcohol level lower than what it should be.Four Danish schoolteachers including history teacher Martin (Mikkelsen) test the idea to inject some zest into their moribund mid-life personal and professional lives.Martin in particular describes his circumstances his failing relationship with wife Anika and poor history teaching career that had so much spark and potential a few years before. The students and principal aren't particularly endeared to his teaching performance with end of school exams on the horizon for some.Initially the 'experiment' is positive and slightly comedic in that they find their mojos as such. Slightly drunk but not to excess and within control.However as the film progresses the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is notched up bit by bit with tragic consequences. Vinterberg neither glamourises or demonizes alcohol culture and the director shows both sides of the coin cleverly using historic figures such as Winston Churchill and Hitler as examples of historic leaders who were either regular drinkers by their own admission and control yet heroes to many (Churchill) and tea totallers yet historic demons to many (Hitler). There is also a little montage of alcohol in modern day political life from Yeltsin and Clinton to Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel.The tragic consequences shown are the usual symptoms of alcoholism and include career difficulties, physical injuries from falls etc. Relationship issues and breakdowns.Excellent performances from the principal cast not only Mikkelsen in the comedic and tragedy scenes.The ending initially comes across as a bit corny for want of a better word but on reflection the celebratory scenes rather than Danish students and their teachers dancing around a harbour as if it is a musical could be a celebration by Martin or as in the title is he just starting the journey into 'Another Round' just as his life is turning a corner?Rightfully received awards recognition including winning Best International Feature Film at the Academy Awards in 2021.",Another Round

50,tm-sheehan,A celebration of Binge drinking nothing more,4,23 May 2021,"My Review- Another Round or ""Druk"" (translation Drinking or Boozing )
My Rating 4/10The 2021 Best International Feature Academy Award Winning film from Denmark.We got around to watching this film from Denmark and I didn't know what to expect and perhaps I got lost in Translation.I'm not a wowser those who enjoy a Social drink good luck to them but I found this movie very confronting and totally unenjoyable.Denmark has some of the highest rates of teenage drinking in the world; a World Health Organization report released earlier in 2020 found that Danish 15-year-olds consumed alcohol at nearly double the European average. Recent efforts to raise the minimum age for purchasing alcohol to 18 from 16 have met with resistance, in part because older adults recall their own youthful intoxications so fondly so you would think a film about 4 rather stupid men consuming huge amounts of alcohol in an experiment wouldn't serve Denmark or any other Nation well , it's certainly not a comedy like "" The Hangover ""2008 which I haven't seen out of choice.While the acting is excellent in ""Another Round."" and I've yet to see the other 4 nominated International Feature films which were ""Quo Vadis, Aida?"" (Bosnia and Herzegovina), The Man Who Sold His Skin Tunisia, Collective Romania, and Better Days Hong Kong I really disliked ""Druk"" and the translation is quite accurate it's all about Drinking snd Boozing and it leads nowhere expect and says nothing except to quote a line from the movie from Martin's Mads Mikkelson wife Anika (Maria Bonnevie) ""I don't care how much you drink all Danes drink like madmen "" and that's all this film is about
four high school teachers who consume alcohol on a daily basis in an ""experiment "" to see how it affects their social and professional lives.What did they expect would happen ?Of course they go crazy , their students and Principal have an intervention ,their marriages and children are traumatised one dies . (Sorry spoiler but I hope no one sees this film)
The reason being from the opening scenes of crazy teenagers drinking and misbehaving in a train to the last scenes of Mads Mickkelsen showing his acrobatic skills in a joyful salute to out of control alcohol abuse.The actor Mads Mikkelsen ends Thomas Vinterberg's film with a wild delight of a drunken dance. He was a professional dancer and can certainly move well but this movie had absolutely nothing to offer me at all and I can't recommend it at all.",Another Round

Yet being brutally honest; I couldn't get behind all these startling praises. Don't get me wrong, I got my own reasons as well!""You must accept yourself as fallible in order to love others and life"" - Søren KierkegaardOut of all names in the nomination list for this year's Oscars; this would be my less preferred pick. In no way, I'm asserting my adverse opinion that the film is bad. Matter of fact, It's pretty darn good. But there are certain things that require pressing consideration!Whereas the story proceeds to unveil whatever damage caused by immoderate liquor consumption; it also ratifies the yearlong tradition in Denmark adjacent to the same matter. In all fairness; for an outlander like me, it is clearly hard to comprehend. Anyway, I get the feeling that somewhere in its transitions the underlying value of the key message slowly faded away.Although it sheds light on multiple crucial perspectives such as life, family, friendship; yet it all appears to be incomplete for some odd reason. On the other hand, there are certain sequences volubly brandishing an absolute brilliance and there's no denying its infallible quality of being subtle and evocative; all at once.Needless to say, other than its trivial shortcomings in the narrative; elsewhere, this has been quite a show worth beholding! Mainly apropos of the striking Cinematography; which quite frankly has exceeded all my expectations. And so did the poignant Score in the back.Finally coming down to the heart & soul of this whole endeavor i.e. The Performances. Long story short, the entire cast did an amazing job! Whilst Mads Mikkelsen as Martin got the largest share of screen time over here; Others did all they could with their limited exposure. Must say, I would have loved to see them equally making viable contributions to the same cause.",Another Round
53,MrDHWong,One of the most engaging studies of the effects of alcohol on the human body ever put to film,9,2 September 2021,"""Another Round"" (a.k.a. ""Druk"") is a comedy drama film directed and co-written by Thomas Vinterberg (""The Hunt""). Starring Mads Mikkelsen in the lead role, it is one of the most engaging studies of the effects of alcohol on the human body ever put to film.In Copenhagen, Denmark, high school teachers Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), Nikolaj (Magnus Millang), Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), and Peter (Lars Ranthe) are long time friends who each believe that their lives have become uninteresting over the years. At Nikolaj's 40th birthday party, the quartet decide to conduct an experiment where they consume alcohol at work to test a theory that a person with a BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of 0.05% performs with a heightened level of creativity and confidence. As the days go by, each of the four friends discover that things are improving for them significantly and soon agree to take the experiment further by increasing their BAC limit to higher percentages.In pretty much every country where it's legal, drinking alcohol is widely considered to be a normal part of a fun night out where one is able to let loose every once and a while. Coming from Australia, one of the most well-known countries in the world to focus around drinking culture, I can personally attest to this as I myself have attended my fair share of parties where such an occurrence is the norm among young and old. As is usually the case with something this important, there are bound to be several films focusing around the consumption of alcohol that are meant to show how much the characters can handle before doing something they later regret. ""Another Round"" not only follows this formula to such a wonderful degree, but it also works brilliantly as a tragic commentary on middle age affecting one's acceptance in society.On the surface, this film may come across as a mere pastiche about group of friends getting drunk simply so they can function better at work. I think such an assessment is unfair because there is far more to this when examined more closely. Alcohol affects every person differently - some develop more confidence in their social abilities while others turn into a depressed wreck. One thing is for certain though, it changes people into someone they normally aren't when sober. This film cleverly uses each of its four main characters to show the various ways of how alcohol is both benefitting and worsening their lives. As a result of this, the film neither glorifies nor condemns its usage, instead depicting it almost as a tool that requires a particular set of skills to master.Each of these four men feel like that they are in a midlife slump with a nostalgic longing for the good old days. Take Martin for example, who is a history teacher whose students don't even respect him anymore due to how bland his teaching methods have become as a result of growing older. One student even stands up and leaves his class out of sheer boredom, not caring one bit if he gets into trouble. When Martin starts drinking before entering the classroom, he transforms into an entirely new person. Before you know it, he is engaging his class in jovial lectures on historical leaders and bringing out the best traits of his students. Like spinach to Popeye the sailor, alcohol eventually serves as a dependable means of acquiring the necessary strength for Martin to accomplish otherwise difficult tasks.But it isn't all good news for him. Eventually, Martin's overdependence on the liquid courage distances him from his family, putting a strain on his marriage. Martin's wife Anika finds it hard to comprehend that the man she married is now more concerned with looking good in front of his students than her. Despite assuring her that he is currently the best person he has ever been, Martin soon realises he has achieved this goal through selfish means. At this point, the film addresses Martin's deeply rooted insecurity - he is fearful that growing old has impeded his chances at success to fit in with the younger generation. These feelings of self-doubt are common among the middle-aged population, so it certainly isn't difficult to believe that many others out there must feel the same way as poor Martin.Director Thomas Vinterberg does a flawless job intertwining each of the four characters' stories with one another, bringing a solid consistency to the overall plot. Although Martin is clearly the main protagonist, his three friends are shown to have just as many interesting traits and quirks worth exploring as well. Due to the nature of their drinking experiment, the four often meet up to see where they are and how things are playing out for them. As previously mentioned, the alcohol affects each of them differently so it's fun to see the results of their lengthy investigation. In doing so, there's a nice balance between genuine drama and tongue-in-cheek comedy that makes a film like this seem so much more sincere than other alcohol-related features of this type.As Martin, Mads Mikkelsen gives one of the best performances of his career. This character could easily have been just another generic man facing a midlife crisis but Mikkelsen brings such a likeable, charming, and often humorous tone to the way he plays him that I eagerly anticipated everything he was about to do next. He never feels like a caricature of a typical drunken dad, instead he's a tragic individual who wants to improve his life as quickly as possible. The three other actors, Magnus Millang, Thomas Bo Larsen, and Lars Ranthe, were also great in their respective roles as Martin's friends. They too have their own obstacles they need to overcome but their differing worldviews prevent this from being a smooth journey.In this day and age where films tend to sensationalise alcohol consumption, it feels like a breath of fresh air to finally watch one that actually provides a more neutral perspective on everything. Though it is true that alcohol has been the cause of many issues in people's lives, it has also led to the creation of several amazing things as well. Renowned author Ernest Hemingway claimed to have written some of his best work while under the influence, but in stark contrast, millions of lives are lost worldwide each year due to excessive drunkenness. The key here is moderation, like the use of an important musical instrument in the composition of a symphony. To quote the immortal words of Homer Simpson: ""To alcohol! The cause of - and solution to - all of life's problems!""I rate it a solid 9/10.",Another Round
54,Alexander_Blanchett,Another Vinterberg,8,12 March 2021,"Very original movies. Usually movies are outlined about characters who try to get sober this one turns it around - Thomas Vinterberg's newest entry to his filmography is actually about ""sober"" people who want to get drunk to find a sense in life.... it started as an experiment but has a fundamental impact on the character's lives, emotions and developments.
The film is funny and tragic. Its an interesting mix as I wouldn't call it a light drama with comedic highlights like a typical dramedy, it is rather a tragedy with some funny or lets say soft elements. The screenplay is fantastic and very original. I loved Mads Mikkelsen who really deserves all the praise he can get. His performance works on so many different facettes and it is hard to read him - far from every stereotype possible and that is were the magic of Mikkelsen's performance lies in. On paper it is already an ordinary character but he was able to make it truly human - like your ordinary teacher/ father kind of guy. Thomas Bo Larasen is always good and its no difference here.

This was one of my most anticipated films of 2020 and it certainly delivered.Another Round follows four friends, who are all teachers, that test out a theory that will make their lives better by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood.With Another Round, Thomas Vinterberg has proved once again how talented of a director he is. This is vastly different from The Hunt. That film was depressing all the way through whereas this film plays out more like a comedy. Here, Vinterberg tackles the drinking culture in Denmark and in general and I loved the way he approached it. The sequence of events stayed believable without going overboard. It sets up the characters well in the beginning as we get an understanding of how mundane their life is in contrast to the scenes that take place after they start drinking. This film could have easily taken the route of showing us all the negative aspects of alcohol but Vinterberg strikes a balance in conveying both sides of the spectrum. He shows us all the fun and happiness that can be had with drinking whilst also bringing to light the problems it can create if it starts to get excessive.Some scenes where the four main characters get extremely drunk are really funny and the actors do an exceptional job. I loved Mads Mikkelsen in The Hunt but this might be my favourite performance from him. There is so much emotional range with his character that he expresses beautifully especially during the ending where he steals the show. It's one of the best performances of 2020. Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe are also amazing and perform excellently when they're drunk. I loved the camaraderie these four actors had on screen. They all felt believable as friends and their characters which elevated the fun in the drinking scenes and the emotion during the more heartfelt scenes. Maria Bonnevie was also really good as Mikkelsen's wife in the film.Another Round is predictable but at the same time I really enjoyed it despite that.

I'm not super familiar with his other films other than knowing they're critically praised. So this was basically my first Vinterberg film. I gotta say I'm really impressed. Another Round is a fun and dramatic film that goes to places you wouldn't expect. Leading the film, Mads Mikkelsen gives us a great performance. I really enjoyed his character and what he's going through. The same for the other three. They're all doing this experiment for some fun but they have issues to deal with already. The constant drinking is only adding up to it. The most intriguing part was seeing what consequences would arise amidst all the fun. The comedy lands well and I chuckled a few times. But the drama behind it all exceeded my expectations. The last act had me itching to see what would come up next.Thomas Vinterberg is a great director. Just by watching this film, I am really interested in his other works. He has a refreshing sort of approach but reminds us of what we have to deal with by having a little fun, even if it's illegal. The beginning didn't quite hook me in. I thought by that I would just feel like it would just be good rather than the raving reviews. After a while, it really starts to pick up and I didn't want to stop. The portrayal of this growing alcoholism is good. They didn't pose it as a good or bad thing. Rather it's a neutral view of what it's like and how it affects people differently. Each of the characters have a different reaction. I'm glad there's variation and not just them getting flat out drunk the whole time. And the way the film concludes is a great ending. I don't want to spoil but it just really works.

Martin, is a high school teacher that basically lost any kind of motivation. He does not enjoy his job anymore, he cannot communicate with his family and he feels so distant from his wife. One day he decides to do an experiment with his colleagues: drinking a little bit of alcohol during the day, in order to be more energetic. The first part is basically a comedy: a group of friends finding purpose in life again. There are many funny scenes that made me laugh. Then, the light-hearted tone becomes darker, things get out of hand and in the second part, the film depicts the dramatic consequences of their choices.I think that the director does a really good job exploring which may be some of the causes for alcohol addiction, how this can influence your everyday life and people around you. The script really deepens characters and their friendship; I felt really attached to them. I think that there was not one single scene wasted, everything fit just perfectly. The cast is phenomenal and it is composed by pretty big names of Danish cinema: Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Larsen are two of the most famous actors in the industry, but they did not shadow Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe, who are as good. Every single actor bringed something to the table, and contributed to tell an emotional story. The very last scene with the song performed by Scarlet Pleasure is one of the most beautiful things that I have watched this year.I absolutely enjoyed ""Another Round"". This movie represents the return of the roots for Mikkelsen, in every sense. I am genuinely happy that after the success obtained through Hollywood blockbusters, he came back to his motherland, promoting, in a way, Danish cinema.",Another Round
65,Rendanlovell,Pretty solid,7,6 December 2020,"The game of life is more art then science. Which is an idea the film links wonderfully to alcholism. One day you're on top of the world. Teaching better then ever and finally reconnecting with family. Then you wind up bloodied on your neighbors doorstep with little idea how you got there or why you're there. Much like Vinterbergs 2012 feature The Hunt, Another Round stars Mads Mikkelsen. Unlike that movie, he isn't at the heart of a town wide witch hunt for crimes he didn't commit. Instead, Mads is an average history teacher living an average life.That is, until his life turns on a dime. He is a depressed, vaccant shell of a man. Unable to connect with his family and even further distant from his students, Mads seems to be drifting lazily through life. After a short 10 minutes, he and his friends decide it's time to change their boring lives. They begin trying to maintain a consistent, albeit low, blood alcohol level in an attempt to spice things up. Suddenly life is better. Mads is outgoing, energetic, and has no trouble with people.You can probably imagine, this falls apart rather quickly. As is such with alcohol, the more you rely on it, the more you need it to function. A hobby turns to a habit, then a habit into an addiction which spirals out of control. Such is life. The moment you let your guard down it punches you in the gut just to see of you're paying attention. Another Round perfectly captures this idea.However, I'm not to high on this. I think it does a good job saying what it desires and is genuinely quite entertaining. It bounces off the walls with energy while oozing a carefree attitude that was infectious. The problem is, it's pretty on the nose. There's large exposition sections that relay information to the audience in less then subtle ways. These characters are monitoring themselves through an ""essay"" on the effects they feel over time. Which gives the film room to explain itself. The problem with this is that it goes nowhere. As do many little things here and there.It seems each character is given a distict role to play in the film and it rarely pivots from those ideas. Making this incredibly predictable from the ground up. If you have a thought of where this is going based on the premise, you're probably right. Which is unfortunate because the payoff of the film feels largely unrewarding. A stark difference between The Hunt's absolutely traumatizing 3rd act.I'd still say check this out though. If you have twelve bucks and two hours to sit down at home, pull the trigger on this. It's quite entertaining, delivers a solid message, and props up some pretty great performances. Unfortunately, If you're looking for something to knock you flat with a powerful message or a satisfactory conclusion this doesn't have it. It builds to the exact place you might think and hits the nail on the head even though the nail is already embedded into it's place.",Another Round
66,deexsocalygal,Not worth watching,5,28 May 2021,"I only watched this because the ratings were so high. I didn't know it's not in English & luckily I don't have an issue reading subtitles. This movie is exactly what it says, nothing more. About 4 high school teachers who decide to keep their blood alcohol level at 0.5 by steadily drinking all day until 8pm. I was very disappointed. This is one of those movies that when it ends you're like that's it? There's no point, no moral, nothing to write home about. I will never watch this again nor can I recommend it. One thing I would like to comment on is that I was blown away that the TEACHERS told a couple of their students who were struggling with their grades to drink alcohol before their finals. This is High School. The teachers handed them hard liquor they kept on them at school & told them to belt back a few big swigs off it because it would help them do better on their finals & not to worry they wouldn't tell anyone. What kind of example does this set? Is that really good advice? Is that truly a good habit to get into? Relying on alcohol to solve the issues they'll run into throughout the rest of their life?

This way you can reduce problems and think more creatively. The four high school teachers know how to teach in an inventive and more relaxed way. As the four drink more and more often, they gradually learn that there is also a negative side to drinking alcohol. They have to determine how far they are willing to go for their experiment, before things get too out of hand.Because the Danish director comes from the country that last year had one of the highest percentages of alcohol use among teenagers in the world, he tries to show with this film what the consequences of alcohol can be. Despite the fact that they try to bring out the consequences of alcohol with this film, they show in a well-balanced way what both the positive and negative sides of the use of alcohol can be. In this way, as a viewer, you get the chance to fill in how you think about alcohol until the end of the film without feeling bad about it.The four leading roles of the film not only come across as colleagues but also as good friends of each other. They continue to support each other during their experiment, but also when one of the four has a personal life. Unfortunately, all four are not presented with the same amount of personal information, so as a viewer you care a bit more about one than the other.

68,madhukar30,My own 0.05% experiment is still in progress !!,7,7 June 2021,"My interest in Druk grew more only after the movie won an academy award for the best international feature. The movie has a pretty simple storyline of four middle aged friends, who happen to work at the same place,
decide to carry out an interesting experiment with alcohol, which requires them to drink during work hours.As the narrative progresses, ""Druk""draws you in with its complexities. Layers of sentiments and human behavior begin to peel away as the four men lose their inhibitions and bringing forth some very raw emotions. Director Thomas Vinterberg gives us a film about living life and he conveys it in equal measures of subtlety, sadness and exhilaration.Cinematography is a mixed bag throughout the movie, it oscillates between some great close ups in the dark to some over-lit bright shots facing the window panes. Screenplay is simple and straightforward, but a bit boring in the middle to support a 117 minute runtime but it pretty much makes it better towards the end. Editing is very raw and bland for my liking but does the job. Production design, costumes and makeup were decent. Music has some good and some bad bits and may not cater to everyone's taste. On the acting front Mads Mikkelson, as the gloomy, listless Martin who goes through many shades of transformation, is simply brilliant. Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe and Magnus Millang also pull in good performances.Overall, Director Thomas Vinterberg gets most of the things right in this rather slightly dull affair, which promises a lot in the beginning but goes flat midway. The movie targeted at a 40+ age groups and may not impact to people younger than the mid thirties as much. But As the film draws to its dying moments, In a burst of infectious, joyous energy exuded by Mikkelson in a dance sequence which almost feels exuberant, one realizes that there are no sweeping judgements or any real closure being served here. 6.9 stars out of 10 for running an interesting experiment and celebrating friendship.",Another Round

And if you think that premise is the start to a whimsical, lighthearted adventure, you'd be half right. From celebratory binges with friends to late night tears over beers, ""Another Round"" demonstrates people's relationship with alcohol, in all of its beauty and destruction.Mads Mikkelsen was pitch-perfect as a professor who is unsatisfied with his life, seeking solace in the bottle. Displaying a vulnerability and quiet desperation, it is fun to watch his transformation to a confident teacher, husband, and friend once he partakes in his pick of poison. Mads is always great in dramatic roles, and it's no different here. There is one incredibly intense scene where he confronts his wife over something while they are eating dinner which does a fantastic job of showing Mads desperately trying to hold on and have some semblance of control over his personal life. Is alcohol his savior, imprisoner, or both?Thomas Vinterberg does great work in directing little character moments, showing how different each person's relationship with alcohol is. From a student potentially having a shot or two to relieve anxiety during class to professors who partake to improve their teaching abilities, the movie is ever fascinating, never portraying alcohol as good or bad - it simply exists, and it's up to each individual person how they choose to use it. The most interesting part of the movie for me was seeing how each character's life begins to subtlety improve as their drinking increases - at least at first. They become more confident professors, breathing new life into their classes and enriching their students' educational experiences. But, the party must end at some point, and ""Another Round"" also shows the tragic effects of alcohol abuse as well.""Another Round"" is an excellent drama that will leave you thinking well after the credits roll. You might relate to the characters and their plight, or you might find them detestable drunks.

74,TheCorniestLemur,Mads you legend,8,20 May 2021,"This was...cheerful? And I liked that?Yeah, yeah I did. This must be the most optimistic film about alcoholism I've ever seen, because it's honest about it. It showcases the soaring highs just as much, and just as effectively as the crushing lows, and although it's not a position I've ever been in, it is one I could potentially have been.I remember when I first came to university and tried alcohol in a social setting, and it was like I'd suddenly unlocked a cheat code. I could talk to girls, I could say all that stupid stuff that I thought would make people laugh but never had the confidence to say before, and most of all, I felt happy.It's not like I wasn't before, but I wasn't exactly the most outgoing person, and that was something I badly wanted to be by the time I went to university. Knowing that, you can probably see how I could have all too easily gotten out of hand like the characters in this film do, but thankfully I managed to control myself just before I started drinking alone.I'm sure when parties and clubs can happen again, I'll be getting royally drunk, but I'm glad that I know my limits and when the appropriate times to drink are.All this stupid storytiming is to say that this film is relatable as hell, because man does it nail that feeling of not having a care in the world when you're just that perfect amount of drunk, and it probably nails how easy it is to slip into addiction as well.I'll say that the ending may have been a bit too cheerful considering what happens in the scene prior, and that some more interesting shot composition certainly wouldn't have hurt, but the performances are all brilliant, the direction from Thomas Vinterberg is amazing, the characters are likable, and for how much of a tonal disaster this easily could have been, it pulls it off so well.So if anything I said just now resonates with you, please watch this, cause sometimes, being honest doesn't mean you have to be miserable about it.",Another Round
75,jamesjustice-92,What drink did,7,4 January 2021,"This movie just might be the perfect example of how life of an ordinary person who drinks occasionally looks like. Starts out boring as their day-to-day life it speeds up when alcohol becomes their frequent companion day in day out up to the point of no return mark and that's usually when someone gets hurt or when it gets ugly (or both). Alcohol pretends to be your friend to make you feel good and confident, it loosens you up and shows your inner fears, thoughts, your hidden demons and not everyone is strong enough to cope with being on the loose all the time. In general Another round speaks loudly of all those things and would be relevant for everyone who knows drinking problems not by hearsay (which is like half of earth's population), to all of the others it would be just another movie with its moral shouting loudly since the beginning and its general idea spoiled in its poster already. That's why I intentionally named this review after D.W. Griffith's infamous 1909 short feature because of how similar they both are in concept. Overall this is a good movie with some nice soundtrack, fine dramatic performances (although a bit too strained for me), some proper thoughts to think about and a smooth aftertaste.",Another Round

Similarly convincing are Mads Mikkelsen and his co-stars, continually making me forget that these are actors and that there is a screen between us. Mikkelsen is emotionally convincing and has an absolutely glorious dance number near the end of the movie.As a Scandinavian, I can verify that it accurately depicts the drinking culture we have here. There have been complaints that the portrayal seems a bit exaggerated for the sake of a point, but I assure you; our high school graduates absolutely ride around on loud party trucks with champagne close at hand.",Another Round
77,danybur,A Faustian pact with alcohol?,6,24 August 2021,"Short summaryVinterberg (so far from his previous film The Hunt) makes a portrait of the midlife crisis of four friends. His idea of a Faustian pact that they make between themselves and with alcohol to overcome it is interesting as I propose and it is beautifully musicalized, very well directed and superbly acted. But the film sadly slides down the slope of the obvious, the conservative message regarding its winners and losers and, worse, demagoguery. It is no accident that he won an Oscar.ReviewFour friends, secondary school teachers in the same school, decide to do an experiment, following the advice of a Norwegian psychiatrist: to start the systematic consumption of alcohol in order to be able to deal with the discomfort caused by their work and family life.Mads Mikkelsen plays a history teacher fed up with teaching, distracted in the classroom and cut off from his wife. His friends are teachers of physical education, music and psychology and with few brushstrokes, we find out about their respective discomforts. One of them proposes to follow the indications of Finn Skarderud, a Norwegian psychiatrist, who supposedly recommends a certain level of alcohol in the blood to improve the relationship with an environment that produces discomfort. In this way, the four friends make a pact and begin to drink alcohol to ensure that daily blood alcohol level.The film shows us the effects that are obtained, in this experiment sustained as a group, but with individual consequences. It is not by chance that the film begins with a ritual in which the students, at the end of high school, carry out a race where it is necessary to drink an enormous amount of alcohol as a requirement to win it. The pact of the four friends has an undeniable adolescent look and needs this kind of scientific legitimation for the acquisition of a habit that ends up challenging that premise. Even an example that Mikkelsen uses in a class incurs a fallacious investment that corresponds to the one that he proposes in the experiment. On the other hand, from the start, they consider the consumption of alcohol as an instrument and not as enjoyment in itself. All this in a society with a satiety fed by its basic needs satisfied and with a very high average intake of alcohol.Another round is of those films in which one wonders, averaging the story and with growing discomfort, what its director is proposing to tell us, what is the message. Because all fiction contains a message, or at least raises questions. And I continue with this bewilderment once I finished watching it and now, despite all the considerations I made in the previous paragraph. Will it be so obvious that you have to drink in moderation or that drinking can never be a method of improvement? And this does not speak well of the film.This kind of portrait that Vinterberg makes (so far from his film The Hunt) of the midlife crisis of four friends and the idea of a Faustian pact that they make between themselves and with alcohol to overcome it is interesting, although it is beautifully set to music. , very well directed and superbly acted, it unfortunately slides down the slope of the obvious, the conservative message regarding its winners and losers and, what is worse, demagoguery.

So, the cast is pretty solid overall.The story tho, I'm a bit conflicted, for most of it I loved the story, and I thought it had gotten the message it was trying to pass, however, after the movie is over, I don't really know.Cause, well, they drink, it sort of helps mainly Martin at first, but, of course he exceeds himself and losses it, as do his friends, they stop, but Tommy isn't able to, and that is clearly what kills him, Martin gets a text from his wife, saying she misses him too, implying Martin has a chance to get his family back... but then they are all drinking and partying like crazy again, in what I assume is still during the day of Tommy's funeral, so... what is the message here? Like, we see the characters go through hell cause of their bad choices, then we root for them, we want them to get better, their friend just died, and here they are getting wasted again? I just find it hard to understand the characters motivation at the end, and it feels a bit like wasted time when at the end of the story, you feel like the characters learned nothing.I had an amicable debate with a friend about the movie afterwards, and well, he strongly defended the story, and the finale for the most part, saying it was actually supposed to be a critic on Danish culture, and the fact that they drink like crazy. And well, fine, ok, I get that, I can see it, and I respect it and like most of the stuff they putted in here as a clear critic. However, still, imo what Martin does at the end, in a lot of ways sorts of denies most of the stuff we thought he had learned throughout the story. And as I said, it feels tough to relate to a character we feel should have learned a lot from the experience he just had, but apparently didn't.Still, I think the movie has a great cinematography, it's pretty well directed and has great performances all throughout, it's definitely worth watching, but the end sort of ruined what I thought would be one of my favorite movies of 2020.",Another Round

Each character hopes that the experiment will help with their particular life problem and while it does help to an extent, the price ends up being too high.

86,PotassiumMan,Drinking like only the Danish can,9,28 December 2020,"Dark, joyful, challenging and wondrously complex, this is a character study of the double-edged sword that alcohol can be in the lives of those seeking revival, release or escape or in the case of four Danish schoolteachers, coping with midlife crisis and a desire to feel free again. These colleagues and friends initially view the concept as a curiosity, but as soon as one of them (Mads Mikkelsen in an explosive performance) actually experiments with the idea, his enthusiasm becomes infectious. From that point on, their curiosity evolves into an obsession and their lives and those around them are affected accordingly.I dare say this film conveys its complicated message and portrayal of human weakness with such realism that it's almost like a documentary. It's highly unlikely that an American film on the same subject would have been this powerful or this real. Do you still smell the alcohol?This is hardly a brand new topic for a film to cover, but this one does it so well, that it makes the whole subject matter seem devastatingly fresh and incredibly real. The best compliment that I can pay is that the characters are true to life in their behavior, in their gradual collapse of discipline and in the impact they have on their families and students. You cannot look away. You can only wonder how it will all end. The film subtly shifts between anguish and exuberance with stunning skill. This is first-rate filmmaking.

It is a harsh criticism of the normalized excess consumption of alcohol and how it affects society, not only in adults but also in young people, it also refers to the fact that alcohol is only an escape from reality and who does not want to accept reality will do everything possible to avoid it without realizing it.

He can dance, he can act like Hannibal Lecter, he can bleed out of his eyes, and he can even be in video games.Druk is not quite the warning of alcohol abuse and dependency that Days of Wine and Roses was. It meanders through various tones and moods, begging the question: ""What is Danish for 'melodramedy'?"" Also, there must be a word in Danish for schadenfreude. Too much fun can be swell, but of course the high-school teachers will take their buzz-worthy experiment of maintaining 0.05% BAC too far, going from quarter-cocked to half-cocked and ultimately totally corked.The movie only suffers from an inability to suspend disbelief. It is hard to believe four teachers would engage seriously in such an experiment, risking their jobs and family lives. There is no finger-wagging or tsk-tsking. We must decide for ourselves whether we should drink more or less, resulting in a simple moral ambiguity instead of some stern moral lesson.Drinking booze can be fun, sometimes it can be dangerous, sometimes it creates a feedback loop of anxiety and depression.

And I learn that he used to be a gymnast and a professional dancer. The list of talents from Mads just keeps on going.2. The Danes are apparently heavy into their drinking culture, and there is no age limit for drinking alcohol (age 16 to purchase but anyone can drink at any time), and drinking in public is encouraged.3. ""Another Round"" features a lot of laughing, celebratory scenes but those scenes don't feel cheerful to the audience. The movie is good at making the viewer feel uneasy and aware that there is an undercurrent of looming tragedy disguised by all the partying and camaraderie.4.

So celebrated director Thomas Vinterberg makes an engaging movie on this subject.Four middle aged high school teachers of Sweden find their job mundane and boring. They decide to drink alcohol in moderation as an experiment to bring zing in their lives not realizing the consequences in store. They also prepare a day to day report on the effects of their drinking.Director has created a film which is entertaining and throws up some issues like midlife crisis, excessive drinking, school kids drinking etc against the backdrop of a Denmark school. The teachers led by Martin ( Mads Mikkelson) do find increased energy in their work and the happy students also experience this change in their teachers. However alcohol is addictive as they soon find out and their drunken demeanor puts their professional and private life in a downward spiral. Martin's marriage is in jeopardy and nearing divorce.

Instead, we get a more realistic take: alcohol isn't going anywhere and maybe it really shouldn't. In our age of peak isolation and loneliness, it's sort refreshing to see a film that celebrates alcohol's ability to loosen people up, the warmth you have from drinking with a group of friends and the satisfaction of a well made drink. It's also an exploration of Danish drinking culture and how - like it or not - drinking is essential to Danish life. Vinterberg doesn't proclaim this as good or bad, but certainly spends a lot of time showing us how a world without alcohol is frankly, a lesser one. This movie is about so much: friendship, marriage, growing up, personal development, the meaning of life.It almost goes without saying, but the performances are amazing here; Mikelsen, as usual, stands out. But everyone has such fantastic screen presence, especially when inebriated. The attention to detail with the drinking scenes makes you wanna grab a cold one as soon as possible.The Bad: nothing really, to be honest.

Despite that, there were some memorable ones that have to be mentioned and Another Round was one of the best without a doubt. With a realtable story that points out the problems of alcoholism, some great performances, the amazing duo of actor Mads Mikkelsen and director Thomas Vinterberg who made the amazing Jagten 8 year ago and some great artistic choices, this was a well-made accessible film that everyone can enjoy and relate to.Starting with the great acting, Mads Mikkelsen is obviously the star in this movie, a talented man that gave this role the appropriate emotion and passion, Martin is the main focus of this movie, his journey is pretty relatable, it includes major problems of modern life and that's were Mads Mikkelsen shines, he brings out the inner pain and conflict perfectly and visualizes the character's mindset so the viewer can subconsciously be totally invested. He is a great and a very talented actor who gets better and better by staying true to his artistic vision. The whole cast was pretty good too, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe, everyone was really succesful on his role and they were all a major factor of this film's success.The story was also amazing, it doesn't hold back and stays true to the realism it needed to have, some scenes are casual and others are totally brutal, leaving you with the bittersweet taste that real life has. It's a great representation of a problem that most people will exaggerate or ignore, but here it's being treated with great respect, it's perfectly realistic and the creator manages to bring out the right message without chessy dialogue, or cringey pseudo-emotional scenes. Another Round is a light drama that has the appropriate effect to the viewer, keeping the balance between sadness and happiness for a rare, impactful and realistic result.Thomas Vinterberg proved many times that he is a very talented and innovative creator that doesn't compromize when it comes to storytelling and direction. He doesn't follow the classic pattern of drama movies, he uses it to reinvent the genre and bring out the balance he needs with smooth and satisfying transition between pain and redemption, love and hate, wisdom and foolishness, he knows how to create interesting characters and the result is memorable and beloved films that stand out and express his artistic vision to an audience who's thirsty for something new.Alcoholism is a major problem, a hidden enemy, something that can happen to anyone. Many people tend to drink more and more to relax and forget their issues. The beautiful dizziness where anxiety doesn't exist is an addictive situation and this movie presents this whole subject as perfectly as it could and as realistic as it is, not a visible situation that anyone can notice, but a discreet problem that grows bigger and bigger.Conclusion:These films are what cinema was made for, Another Round entertains and informs the viewer at the same time, it's a must-watch piece of art, not too complicated for people to experience, easily accessible and meaningful. Movies like this one deserve everyone's attention for their artistic value with no hint of pretentiousness.Rating: 9/10",Another Round
109,Criticalstaff,Liked it but did not love it.,8,4 June 2021,"It is a good film that deserves its accolades. The direction is competent and the movie is constructed around an interesting and creative premise: that the human body is made to tolerate a higher level of alcohol than naturally present.Yet the movie kinda falls short in the third act. It takes you to high places and then to really low points, but then it does not know how to resolve it. The plot lays out a number of thread and ideas, but it does not conclude them satisfyingly. It botches the resolution or abandons most of them to end in a soft happy end that is somewhat disappointing. When you learn that it is based on a short the director made years ago, it makes sense. It does feel like they streched a neat tidy idea without an end in sight. You could shave a half hour of the movie and not lose anything.The first half is great though. From the beginning, you discover that it is a movie about Martin's middle-life crisis disguised as a social drama on the effects of alcohol. It is cleverly written, the performances are excellent, and you rapidly engage in the social dynamics of this merry group of friends. The first half documents the rise, and obviously, you're expecting the fall. But, it never really comes, and that is where the movie gets frustrating. There are glimpses for instance that Martin had something darker in him from the start and that this alcoholic binge is just a façade that will be his downfall. But, there a never real adverse effects to the characters actions and we never get there. Drinking in the day time has mostly positive effects.Even when they increase the dosage they don't really suffer the consequences. The sequence where they get poop faced is not nearly as transgressive or humiliating enough. One guy gets yelled at by his ever-nagging wife, and Martin wakes up on his neighbour's lawn. It needed a scene of a real low point like one them wakes up at the hospital or they forget to turn off the stove and burn the house down. It needed to go full Trailer Park Boys Jim Lahey.In the second half, the story that was about a man's middle-life crisis turns into high-school drama. It is not necessarily bad, but it comes out of nowhere and is not nearly as riveting. The characters face low-points that ultimately are rather painlessly resolved and feels hollow. There is something of a disconnect with the beginning of the movie that felt more loaded and subversive. The character that was the least developed and had the less to lose abruptly dies without a real reason leading to it. Everyone rekindles with his or her wives and children; it is a missed opportunity for genuine catharsis.I feel that it would have benefited of following a more generic structure where Martin's tendencies lead him to self-destruct. That's what the narrative needed, a man who immolates himself through an addiction. I liked it, but I wanted to love it.",Another Round

118,blackoutH,Vinterberg and Mads - a killer duo,9,17 February 2021,"Another achievement from director Thomas Vinterberg, it's been an absolute delight discovering multi national films, this is coming from someone who for a long time got stuck with American movies.After seeing The Hunt from 2012 from the same director, I was automatically drawn to getting to know more of his work, fast forward to now and his most recent masterpiece ""Druk"" (Another Round - English title).
It tells a story of 4 high school teachers who seem to be experiencing what you could generically classify as a ""middle life crisis"" and decide to embark on an experiment based on a real life controversial theory, that the human being is born with a deficit of alcohol in their blood, so they decide to have a low level of alcohol ingested on a daily basis to test this out.First of all the movie is incredibly realistic, both the student and the teachers depiction as well as their relationships and personal lives are so naturally brought to the screen you almost feel you are actually seeing a real life story, and this I believe is one of the strongest aspects of the movie, of course this is accomplished by the amazing direction skills as well as the acting department, specially from Mads Mikklesen himself.You get drawn to the story and the characters, and strangely enough the movie isn't either a celebration or a censorship for alcohol consumption, given that Nordic countries including Denmark, have a very different relationship with drinking and culturally they are indeed associated with high consumption of alcohol, the movie brings out the awfulness and the harm that it can cause to someone's life, but at the same time, it also showcases that in certain aspects or circumstances it can also be an enabler, specially when the source of joy doesn't come from the consumption itself, but instead, the consumption serves as a celebratory method to showcase your happiness in the first place.It's a controversial topic, and this is what I like about this director, you probably won't get such honest themes being depicted on your regular Hollywood movie, and this guy isn't afraid to show you his approach on a topic regardless if it's a taboo one or a controversial theme.

123,severindringel,A film that tells about more than four alcoholised men,9,19 March 2021,"Director Thomas Vinterberg cannot be praised enough for this film. After four days of shooting, his daughter Ida was killed in a car accident. After a week of mourning, the Dane was back on the set. The idea for the film was also inspired by his daughter. It tells how four middle-aged schoolteachers go through their midlife crisis based on a theory of the Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud, who says that a blood alcohol level of 0.05 makes people go through life more relaxed and free.Each of the four main characters gets their own storyline and lets us share in their suffering in life. Once the actually optimistic psychology teacher Nikolaj, played by Magnus Milland, who has to deal with bed-wetting children at home. Then the hapless choir director Peter (Lars Ranthe), who sees himself as an expiry model and cannot find love. Sports teacher Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), a coach who is actually loving towards his kids but lacks any motivation. And finally Mads Mikkelsen's character Martin. He accepts being a bore and goes through life virtually invisible, which has an impact on his marriage to Anika (Maria Bonnevie). The plot is told almost exclusively from Martin's perspective. Mikkelsen thereby appropriates pretty much all the facets a person can have. At first he is desperate, then through regular alcohol consumption he suddenly becomes lively and cheerful, before his emotional world is a constant up and down at the end. Mikkelsen disappears into his role and plays this character with a great deal of subtlety and sometimes impulsiveness. Not only Mikkelsen is fantastic, his three co-protagonists also act at a high level. This is especially noticeable in the scenes in which the four of them discuss their project, explore new spheres and go out together. In the individual moments, Mikkelsen stands out because Martin takes up the most screentime.Another Round is a funny film for the most part, although the dramatic moments predominate, especially towards the end. Only then do you really become aware of its seriousness and it takes you with it. Actually, many elements correspond to a classic tragicomedy. Vinterberg manages to lay out the film in such a way that this is not always obvious and you stick to one genre in every scene. It may be mainly about the (worrying) drinking culture among adults and young people in Denmark, but Another Round is also an appeal to life in general. Yes, alcohol can awaken undiscovered free spirits in people, but equally it can literally destroy relationships and lives. Vinterberg covers all these aspects brilliantly. Most of the film runs without any musical accompaniment. But when it does, the classical music adapts to the action. The same goes for the camera work and shots: When the characters are in crisis, the film drags. When they're on the edge, it thrills with outstanding pacing. Yes, Another Round may be tedious in places, but this ""weakness"" is made up for by the explosive finale at the latest, which may be the best of the entire year.",Another Round
124,olliecurtis,A great exploration of the ups and downs of alcoholism,8,27 December 2020,"This film shows addiction in a more positive and controlled manor than, say, Requiem For A Dream (2000). But although you often know that they will go back to their day to day lives after getting drunk, you still have to suffer the consequences with the characters. The characters and acting in this film are what makes it for me. These 4 guys have a real chemistry that shows on screen. The direction is very good from Thomas Vinterberg, and the screenplay is funny and depressing and heartwarming all at the same time. Without spoiling the ending, I found it to be more depressing than other viewers seemed to find it. Many saw it as them being on top of the world, I couldn't help but keep thinking, what next? What do these characters go home to? Will they keep chasing these highs? Will it destroy them? I personally found this very fitting of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), who had been nihilistic from the moment he took a swig of vodka. Overall this film is a funny, often lighthearted look at alcoholism and friendship that can still involve the viewer and will make them think.",Another Round

129,sackofwhine,Encapsulates life,9,3 April 2021,"I adored this film.Vinterberg absolutely nails it. The man just gets it. Humor, drama, emotion, complexity and those moments that make life so special yet also undeniably frustrating. The rollercoaster ride that brings us both the pure joys yet also the lowest of the lows. This film somehow encapsulates those feelings that makes our entire existence on this godforsaken planet so excruciatingly special. Here's the thing though, I absolutely noticed how Vinterberg uses some familiarity in the narrative progression to ease us into the film as there are definitely elements here that one could find sappy and cliched in any other film- but because Vinterberg refuses to go for coca-cola-sweetness and instead serves up a fine meal of refined tastes, you don't question it, you accept it, with a confident smile you say ""of course, this makes absolute sense in the context of the film"".The editing and cinematography are phenomenal. Let me be clear, if you don't think this film looks good, you don't know what you're talking about. This is supreme filmmaking, top of the game, in how all the formal foundations just boost the entire material up. And the end scene is just the cherry on top.Cinema is alive!",Another Round
130,Bek204,"""What a life""",8,14 September 2020,"Four friends, all high school teachers, test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood. (Source: IMDb)I'm glad that I had the chance to enjoy watching Another Round at home and that's thanks to the Toronto International Film Festival.After his unforgettable performance in ""The Hunt"", Mads Mikkelsen gives us another great performance as he plays Martin in ""Another Round"", if I would choose which one is his best performance, I would choose ""The Hunt"" for sure and that's because of the emotional and deep feelings that character had and Mads Mikkelsen was able to express that perfectly, In ""Another Round"" his character is kind of similar to the one in ""The Hunt"" but the difference is that in ""The Hunt"" his character was battling a difficult time of his life as he gave up on it and doesn't have anything left to lose, he was desperate, but in ""Another Round"" it's kind of the opposite, he is trying to improve his life by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in his blood hoping it'll work, and Mads Mikkelsen was brilliant in that, sometimes by just looking into his eyes, you can feel what's inside of him, grief / happiness / loneliness / sadness and etc...
The supporting cast was was brilliant, his other 3 friends were all great in their performances, when they wanted us to laugh we did laugh and when they wanted us to get emotional we did indeed get emotional, perfect casting.For those who don't know both ""The Hunt"" and ""Another Round"" are directed by Thomas Vinterberg and that's why you might notice that the movie is a bit smilier to ""Th Hunt"" with the set design, the characters, and the message of the film, for example, the scene where the 4 friends went to the supermarket when they were drunk kind of reminded me of the one in ""The Hunt"" when he went inside the supermarket and got kicked out, but in my opinion, I prefer ""Another Round"" than ""The Hunt"", I gave ""The Hunt"" a 6.5/10 and I was disappointed by it especially that it has so many good reviews and that's why I was worried of watching ""Another Round"" because I felt like it would be the same but I was wrong.
""Another Round"" had so many conversations that were long but they were so fun not like ""The Hunt"", all the conversations were boring and cold, for example in ""Another Round'' the scene that all of them were having dinner and that's when we started to know the story of the movie and where the movie is taking us, the movie started off with happiness and with so much energy but as we were going towards the movie it started to go down little by little and slowly and that's what I loved about it. The movie makes you wonder what will happen at the end and what their lives will be in the end and that's a thing that made me want to watch and enjoy the movie, the film made us happy and sad and happy and sad again all the time.The set design was beautiful, the camera angles were able to capture the beauty of the set design and that's not a new thing to a Thomas Vinterberg film and maybe that might be the main reason why this movie remained me of ""The Hunt"". Martin's apartment, the school, and the dinner table with the amazing designs of the cups and glasses.
The custom designs were pretty okay, they were matching the environment very well.Finally, the music was brilliant and a great choice, especially that song at the very end when Martin was dancing around, such a great scene and a nice ending to a nice movie.So glad that I was able to be one of the first people to watch & review ""Another Round"", great movie, and highly recommend it.My rating is: 8/10",Another Round

Every sip of the sweet french brandy fuelling each passing minute of the movie: A thought train running in my mind was - Is the movie trying to idealise alcohol consumption. Well, it doesn't but would I say it did tread on borderlines of embracing alcoholism as a medium for people to lose inhibitions and express themselves better - which is why and how the movie stands out from the crowd and transports viewers to the lives of the character and the world.I enjoyed every bit of the movie, it was just like trying craft beers at a newly opened distillery - you don't know whats going to pop up next and when it does you are only pleasantly surprised and it raises your curiosity on whats going to come next.Mads brings to screen an amazing performance, worthy of an oscar if only it was a mainstream Hollywood cinema.

Essentially a film about a bunch of men experimenting with themselves as a group with continuous inebriation to see how it can perhaps bring some joy or improvement in their lives.The results of this intake of alcohol at regular levels are different for each of them. The 2nd half of the film is pretty much about that. And it is done BEAUTIFULLY!You can see and feel how the characters feel after they have all been introduced in the beginning of the film.The magic of the film is not about some beautiful, technicality or something but it is the simplicity with which it is shot and how the narrative is progressed. The emphasis is all on the characters and their quiet, beautiful Danish environments. There are few really good and joyful sequences in this otherwise slow burner of a film but it is the climax that you leave with in the end.The central character played Mads Mikkelsen is left 'open-minded-ended' in the end and it leads you to believe a variety of emotions on his behalf.My rating: 9/10 *********

The one fat guy with the three kids was the reason Tommy became an alcoholic. It was the othe three friends that bailed on Tommy because he was fired due to their drinking that they were all engaged in at school. That job was his life and so were those kids, yet they didnt go to make sure he was doing OK. They just left him alone because he was no longer working at the school so he ended up drinking himself to death. What kind of friends are those? Especially when he made it clear he was going to kill himself when he was on the door step leaving. It was so obvious that it would take a low IQ dolt not to realize what he was really saying!!! They glorify drinking and ignoring your friends when they need you the most. I thought this movie was going to be funny, which it was, but then I saw how selfish these grown men are, and how they weren't there for a friend that they turned into an alcholic. Tommy was fine before they started this idiotic study of theirs. Tommy was helping these kids and was a great coach. They ruined that for him because they only cared about him when he was drinking with them and working at the school but once he was fired they stopped caring! I was very upset seeing how this movie played out at the end. These guys just kept drinking and acting like they are 18 year olds! These are grown men acting like complete losers and couldn't even be there for one of their ""friends"" who was obvioulsy distraught and in a lot of pain because he lost his job working with kids which is what gave his life meaning. His ""friends' essentially peer pressured him into destorying his life and then they stopped caring about him since he wasn't working at the school anymore! Horrible film with a horrible message! I thought the message would chance but it didn't. And all of a sudden the wife just suddenly changes her mind about their marriage? HAHA! That relationship is over! Done!

Alcoholism is the main theme here, which elicits an interesting question to mind: What is the film's overall message and tone going to be? Is it going to promote a positive attitude towards drinking, focusing on the joys one an experience when getting drunk with friends? Or, is it going to illustrate the negative side effects of alcoholism? The answer? Both. And despite the balance and the necessary gravity of the theme that is explored here, the film maintains a very relaxed, fun, and lighthearted character. And it does all of this is a concise manner, which is reflected in the film's runtime (just under two hours). To top it all off, for me, the most beautiful thing about this film is that I know I can recommend it to practically everyone. That is how lighthearted and balanced this film is.

I usually can't take the characters seriously and the way they express themselves in are typically extremely awkward, stiff and sometimes borderlines embarrassing. From that you can probably guess that a good danish movie to me is typical a dime in a dozen. Looking at my rating for the movie you will know that this is one of them. I absolutely loved this film. Most of all It's a fun time for everyone of the appropriate age, while still reaching deeper depths in its themes like life and alcoholism.The concept of your keeping a constant blood alcohol level of 0.5 precent with the benefits of having more confidence or being more open to meeting new people is something we all could need, and would make everyday tasks and life more fun. That said most of us know that being intoxicated at all times isn't the best idea, even if the benefits might seem better than the cons at first glance. It's so simplistic, in a good way, that it almost comes as a surprise to me having never seen a movie tackle alcohol in this manner.The writers, the cinematography and the actors all did an amazing job on this movie, which truly brought it to life. It has some much energy and the actors all have such great chemistry. The cinematography is beautiful and as the movie progresses you see the environment and lighting reflect Martin's, Mads Mikkelsen's, mental state evolve and dissolve.With an amazing cast, great music and a good sense of direction and plot, this is easily recommendable to a lot of people, and a movie that will be remembered in the danish movie industry for many years.

164,taranpannu01,Another Round (2020),9,12 February 2021,"What a beautiful, beautiful ride.Another Round is an intoxicating (thanks Stephen Dalton), smile inducing and thoughtful dramedy simply about life. Thomas Vinterberg's film is touched with a known personal tragedy but the film is about embracing life and the fact that he was able to continue to (expertly) direct this film is an ode to him and his craft.The script is from Vinterberg and long time collaborator Tobias Lindholm has so many layers and allows each character to share their own experience. Obviously Mads Mikkelsen plays the main character, but a brilliant ensemble of Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe all shine with their individual moments. Millang in particular makes me laugh a lot not just in his films but in interviews, a very Danish sense of humour which I share.The chemistry between the men is infectious and it is clear that the four are good mates in reality, I found myself laughing more in this film then I expected. I knew it would have funny moments but certain reviews make it out like it is a depressing drama which in my experience was not that case. Be ready for some serious laugh out loud moments.It also helped I had a decent audience, Australian audiences can sometimes be a little worse for wear but I had a great audience (we were all last minute cinema goers before our round 3 of corona virus induced lockdown).Mads Mikkelsen is amazing. We know this. He has been my favourite actor for almost ten years and he can do no wrong. He is heartbreaking, funny, pathetic at times and just contagiously mesmerising. Of course we have to mention the final scene which shows all of his hidden majesty. Like Shaun Parkes in Steve McQueen's 'Mangrove' (Another performance that will wrongfully not get recognised this year), Mikkelsen's face takes up half the screen and Vinterberg and brilliant DOP Sturla Brandth Grovlen allow him to do all the work by simply putting the camera to his noggin.Technically this is a sound film. The aforementioned cinematographer Grovlen is brilliantly loose with his camera and captures everything like a fly on the wall, there is some brilliant use of on screen text and photographic montage and the colour grade was incredibly luxurious.This film is something I believe we all needed (and still need) after what the world is going through at the minute.

The actors are great and you get a genuine feel of their friendship even though the emotional interactions are understated as we would probably expect in Norway.Basically a group of teacher friends experiment to see if alcohol will improve their performance and possibly their lives. It perfectly illustrates both the benefits and problems of alcohol and fundamentally, I guess, illustrates why we humans have such a love/hate relationship with it. The setting is interesting, and the story weaves the sincere care they have for their students within it with beautiful small subplots.The final scene is also touching, beautiful and touches a part of your heart in a way few films do: the innocent joy of life and acceptance of both the good and bad things that come with it.It's not a comedy. It's a sincere film that draws you in and makes you feel for the characters. I wanted another film just like it afterwards. Anyway, not for those looking for laughs/action/crazyness but is for those that want a small insight into Norwegian culture, how middle aged people feel about their lives, and how alcohol touches us in both good and bad ways. The lead is fantastic. I'd say this was definitely one of the best 2 or 3 films of the year.",Another Round
166,Jouford,How does he keep doing it?!,10,6 June 2021,"For me, Mags is probably in the top 5 actors in the world at the moment. Even in lemons such as Chaos Walking he can capture your attention and draw you into a nonsensical story. Not that his film is a lemon. Far from it, in fact.In Another Round he once again shines; as a man who's home and work life have devolved into the boring and the humdrum. As have the lives of his three closest friends, so they decide to undertake a psychological experiment; involving the daily consumption of alcohol. The results are mixed, and fascinating to watch. The performances from all involved here are superb, and I can't recommend this film highly enough. Even if it's only to witness Mags' dance scene.Do yourself a favour - watch this film.

Is this movie advocating for alcoholism? Perhaps not, but it certainly isn't steering away either. This movie is trying to be comedy, drama and art.

It was mixed with profound insight and entertainment. It allows for so much discussion and sharing of your thoughts about life itself. Hidden in this film is an understanding of Denmark's ""hygge"".

In my eyes the movie didnt want to show the negative aspects about drinking alcohol in first place but showcased human sorrow, loneliness and boredom of every day life.Drinking alcohol was their way of handling stress at work, unhappy marriages and to drown their feelings of inadequacy and low self worth in it.It was heartbreaking for me to watch how the four men slipped down the path of self destruction, eventhough some of them managed to get out of it.But apart from all of this the movie managed to convey some kind of hope, because all this negative feelings wont stay forever and somehow life will go on, regardless of the outcome.I also think this movie portrays really well the inability of many men to handle emotional pain.

177,jahn-00325,Humorous drama with heady Scandinavian backgrounds,8,22 February 2021,"Simply speaking, the film shows us what happens to middle-aged men when they didn't party enough in their youth. What starts as an innocent and funny alcohol experiment for four schoolteachers ends up leading to a whole baggage of all sorts of consequences in their lives.Sure, the story is much deeper than that: the characters don't only have fun while getting drunk and communicating but also take another perspective on their existence and even reassess some of its aspects. The heroes themselves seem very human: to the extent that they behave quite annoyingly at times, especially when you expect them to act firmly and decisively, whereas they drown in their alcoholic passiveness instead.As a huge bonus to the four friends' drunk adventures the film skillfully portrays details of Danish school life and some cultural aspects of Danish lifestyle overall. When talking about Scandinavia there are always images of natural beauties springing to mind, and the work proves it right: the sea, forests and accurate greenery here and there - all fits into the narrative well.As a result, the film turns up to be a wonderful tragic comedy giving its spectators not only reasons to laugh and feel ashamed of its drunk characters' behavior every now and then but also experience sadness and tranquility when watching the dramas of their lives unfolding against the background of heady Scandinavian nature.",Another Round

186,FreddieLee04,A daring Danish warning disguised as a feel-good romp.,9,3 July 2021,"I wish people would stop declaring Thomas Vinterberg's latest movie as a promotion of alcohol. Dig deeper people, this fantastic film is much more of a warning to casual drinkers about just how slippery the slippery slope into acoholism really is. And just like how our four primary protagonists joke at the thought of themselves being alcoholics, we too can be caught up in the cloud of denial that these characters ultimately become shrouded in.Whilst at his own birthday celebration, Magnus Millang's psychology teacher, Nikolaj, casually slips into conversation with his three teaching collegues about a study done which proposed that humans naturally have lower-than-desired alcohol blood levels. The group seem uninterested, sip their wine and swiftly move onto a new topic. Mads Mikkelsen's character however, History teacher Martin, opens up to the group about his internal struggles- which he identifies are linked to his lack of motivation to teach when compared to his younger days.Soon enough, the group find themselves undertaking a research project which involves drinking the equivalent of 1-2 glasses of wine before a school day and subsequently recording the effects, which begin positive. We see where this is going, yet, I remained glued to the big screen as I was fascinated about the excuses that the teachers would conjure in order to raise the amount of alcohol they would consume.I'm convinced that this film will speak to many drinkers, casual or heavy, reminding them how fragile they are. They walk the line of alcoholism everytime they drink. And after the struggle of a year that many have faced, that line may be finer for some more than others. Screen this movie everywhere you can- it contains a needed message whilst being delightfully wrapped up in a sweet, feel-good container which is fulled to the brim with dark humor.No, it doesn't compare to Mads' 2013 project with the same director, The Hunt, but it does offer a two-in-one. What a beautifully made blast-of-a-movie that carries a hidden lesson we could all learn.",Another Round

188,TruthTeller98765,I love this movie - one of the best of the year!,10,14 May 2021,"It has been a long time since we have been treated to a movie like Another Round. It is set in Denmark and English is not its natural language, so if you cannot get on board with subtitles, I would not bother with this movie (and shame on you for not trying it in its natural language).Some reviewers claim this movie glorifies alcoholism and I do not know how to retort them other than to say that it is a ridiculous assertion and that this movie actually does the opposite. The ""pro-alcoholism"" critique of Another Round reminds me of when Joker (2019) came out and people said it glamorized people wanting to live the Joker's violent lifestyle. No one who actually watched Joker would want to live that man's life, and no one who watches Another Round is going to come away wanting to become an alcoholic.Another Round is about a group of teachers going through a series of mid-life crises who turn to alcohol to spice up their lives, at least at first. What makes Another Round great is simply the main cast and the fact that they all fit together well. The actors balance together a mix of drama, comedy, and tender moments, and it feels like Another Round is really all three of those elements together at once. It feels like real life, to that extent. We find humor in the drama of our daily lives, and vice versa.Mads Mikkelsen was born to play this role. I also appreciated that the movie did not follow the standardized, modern path that so many movies take nowadays of simply devolving downward into an ""everybody suffers"" ending. This movie could have gone that way where everybody goes overboard on alcohol and everyone loses everything that matters to them, but that is not what happens. Instead, we are treated to a very different type of ending, which I would simply suggest you watch to appreciate.",Another Round

It's very sad and so shameful that some people described this film as a praise to alcohol. Absolutely false; it makes you understand the value of life, friends and all those who love us, not through alcohol but through the maturity in choosing the good and balanced lifestyle. Thomas Vinterberg not only paid homage to his missing daughter but also paid homage to entertainment - which has no age - and to that bright part of our lives we often keep aside. Then, Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect key of this movie. I think he should have been nominated for Best Actor.

191,troestrup,"Entertaining, thoughtful and reflective across the board",9,1 June 2021,"I suppose, it's my turn to deliver some insights, while I listen to ""What a life"" this movie shows with beautiful thematic uniformity throughout it.As a Dane, movie lover and whiskey aficionado myself, obviously it was very much about time that I finally visited the cinema to watch the movie. Better late than never, though, and thus am I glad, I got to watch it on the big screen in time.The movie perfectly balances the risk of alcohol glorification with the equally great risk of a lifted finger on this subject. At no point during the move did I feel either scolded nor encouraged to drink. Simply put, the movie merely presents the theme in a neutral manner, leaving it up to the viewers to make up their own mind about it. The latter being one of many reasons for the +15 rating in Denmark. It is a film for adults, plain and simple, so no further elaboration is needed on this note.Continuing, this of course means that there is no direct message of the film. The message is based on each and every viewer, who in turn is based on their own culture and relation to the inherent subject.Needless to say, but nonetheless necessary to bring up in this case, is the extremely incredible performance by all actors in the movie, including minor and micro characters.Obviously, Mads Mikkelsen (and ""obviously"" doesn't do this guy much justice here) is yet again able to stun and completely paralyze his audience with another luxuriously captivating performance, and... (Ohhh! Almost gave away the best part there. You will have to see the movie for yourself).Structurally, I occasionally got Tarantino vibes, though not as crazy and farfetched in a fictional realm as is often the case with his movies. ""Druk"" has a unique ability to stay grounded in such a comparison, keeping the pace of the film slow, steady and blurred, reflecting both the euphoria of being drunk and the different stages of alcoholism. (You will know what I mean when you see it).Frankly, the only flaw of the movie might be the missing (or hidden, or at least not easy to find) second plot point. I wasn't able to notice it, which resulted in a bit stretched sequence from about 70% of the movie until 85% through. Even if the previous parts of the movie did an excellent job until this point, in that exact range of its timeline not a lot of new information is introduced, and the movie therefore loses its pace and entertainment a little, which really is a shame, because it absolutely delivers on all other counts.All in all, if we take the heavy, dark and a bit clichéd theme and the structural stretch aside, the movie's Oscar is certainly still justified, because all the other film technical elements are in their right place, while daring to escape the ""box"" a little as well, keeping the movie original, fresh and conceptually interesting. So, to sum up: All the criteria for an Oscar winner are fulfilled here.",Another Round

The idea is Vinterberg's primary concern, the characters are obviously a distant second. There's not enough background material for me to care for any of the characters.Also, Vinterberg takes a lot of shortcuts to get his points across instead of actually narrating. Here's what I mean:1. The carelessness of the students in the beginning of the movie is deeply exaggerated.2. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) asks his wife if he's become boring. I cringed when I heard him ask that. Come on, Vinterberg: Show, don't tell. We're supposed to see (!) that he's boring, not that he's literally asking her.3. Exaggerated focus on close-up's to show how amazed the students are by Martin, once he's had something to drink. Vinterberg is persuading us, he's not just showing the action.Overall, the film suffers from a lack of depth. Here's what I mean:1. The ""real life"" montage of drunk politicians is extremely misplaced and takes the focus off the narrative. And this is the case in point: Vinterberg is not as interested in the characters as he is in the idea.2. The alleged friendship between the four men is never established. We never get an idea of what they talk to each other about besides their ""mission"". Vinterberg just shows them laughing and then adds sentimental music for emotional effect. This is lazy writing.3. Martin's ""change"" already occurs 18 minutes into the movie (where the four of them sit at the table). His character is not yet established at this point.In conclusion: The movie definitely has its share of memorable and well-directed scenes, but overall it lacks depth and a reason for us to care for any of these characters.",Another Round

Later on as a 30 something I watched THE HUNT, and was amazed by the good storytelling, the ability of Vinterberg of making you feel so outraged with the injustice Mads character suffers, and of course with Mads work. Then as a 40 year old I watched last night ANOTHER ROUND, and I found out that Vinterberg is a constant cinematographic genius, exploring smart theories. I really appreciate he doesn't try to school in a LEAVING LAS VEGAS style, of how bad alcohol is. It's a story about moderation, self government, and redemption. Vinterberg makes sure to approach alcohol with an analyst eye, and not of a moralist. After all, alcohol is not to blame when it is abused: it's still a human error to misuse it.

It's all so predictable. And it's not even like they try to prove some point or that some thing has changed. Why would they leave their friend like that is a mystery or they are just plain stupid. Then Mads' wife comes back to him all of a sudden. It's like those cliched movies where the writers just do whatever they want with any character without any logic. I understand that it's more about how life is and the behavior of people when such things happen, but.. that's exactly what you expect, so I don't get the accolades. I am not sure if people of Denmark expect something else because of their drinking culture though. Nothing makes sense really, many boring moments through out, the only thing that stands apart is the acting, Mads and Thomas as always are amazing.I absolutely loved Vinterberg's previous movies I watched - Hunt and Celebration.

The emotions portrayed by the actors and Mads Mikkelsen in particular felt very honest. The special relation of the alcohol culture in Denmark with this movie caused both comedic as dramatic moments in the story. Vinterberg succeeded very well in lifting this movie to a melancholic vision on midlife crisis instead of a simple but dull comedy. Hearing the emotions in the theater and my own experience, many people both laughed and shed some tears during the 2 hour long duration.

215,JamShake-101,Hold The Champagne,6,18 July 2021,"'Another Round' is one of those films where my lasting impression is one tainted by a sense of what could have been. Let me state clearly for the record, the film is by no means a failure, with a lot to like: As you would expect, Mads Mikkelsen is sublime (particular praise must be given for his work in the film's first half, with such subtle physical touches used to great effect. These evolve into an impressive and wildly different physical display later on), the central premise is innovative yet involving, the supporting cast solid, the score oh so memorable and there are some real moments of humour and novelty, as well as some poignant, important questions raised.But. But, but, but. A Best International Feature Oscar. An acclaimed director. One of the world's best leading actors. I really expected this to hit harder and to lead to a more incisive finale. 'The Hunt' still sticks in my mind months after viewing it, and whilst it's a notably different affair, I can't help but notice how Vinterberg really crystallises the lasting tension, pain and emotion perfectly in its closing scenes, whilst Another Round's ending feels diffuse by comparison.Sebastian was clearly a vehicle for the film's central through line, the Kierkegaardian notion that 'you must accept yourself as fallible in order to love others and life', however the scene in which this is delivered felt like somewhat of a cop out. If this was truly a powerfully observable, lived reality for the characters, we wouldn't have needed this signpost moment. It's clear that Vinterberg is aiming for a structure which illustrates the idea 'everything is the same, but everything is different', with the return to the restaurant, the implied reunion of Martin and Anika, and the bookend scenes involving the students' unbridled, drunken celebrations, however instead of striking that note it feels rather as if the central characters, and indeed the film, haven't truly confronted their problematic realities and made a definitive choice, statement or realisation. It feels rather as if Tommy's death just facilitates a tail off into a return to life as before, which is obviously not the intended feel.I really, really wanted to feel differently about this, to revel in Mikkelsen's fantastic final moments, and to emphatically feel that dual sense of pathos and joy of acceptance which I know Vinterberg was aiming to invoke. But 'The Hunt' it is not. The promise does not fully materialise, and, to my mind at least, we don't emerge into a sobering reality but rather are left with a hazy, hungover like state in which we have some muddled sense of what should have been, but are left wondering exactly where things went awry.",Another Round

The film follows these 4 as a friend group of high school teachers that set off on an experiment to test a theory that humans naturally have a Blood Alcohol Content that's 0.5% too low. Oh you Danish people. I found this film extremely entertaining.And it WAS so entertaining from the get go. The opening scene of Another Round drew me right in from the start and the camera work was a big part of that.I have a pretty low tolerance for egregious shallow depth of field in film. It just comes off like a cheap trick to me for some reason. This film did it right. Another Round used focus like any part of a film should be used - as a thematic tool. It's a fairly simple connection - moving in and out of focus depending on how coherent your character is - but the cinematographer for this film did it with restraint and artfulness to the point that u was swooning over it by the 2nd act.That said, the time it took to get to that 2nd act felt like nothing. This film flew by, even at two hours long. The plot is just such a fascinating concept that I lost track of time right along with the characters.Another Round is a cautionary tale that knowingly qualifies itself. I think people will interpret it differently depending on their background, but that's my interpretation of the ending.A cautionary tale without being a lifetime film, a celebration of alcohol without a blind eye to the morning after, and an unclear message that allows you to draw your own conclusions.

The premise is interesting enough, so as a psychology major in college I decided I'd give it a try just because of the premise, and as a film geek I'd give it a try as a Mads fan, but I wasn't expecting it to be as great as it was. The tried and worn tropes of a beat down high school teacher needing to inspire his kids, a group of grown men feeling like their lives are past, and a man slowly on the way out of his marriage are all present but in this case it isn't a bad thing. It's not a bad thing not just because they're done ""well"" or ""correctly"", but because the writers and director understood what was behind those tropes and had something to share with them. They were a part of a bigger message than just making a movie that will make money, and that's something that can be rare today. And on top of the plot lines being purposeful and meaningful they were handled incredibly well I'm terms of coherence and cohesion. They don't baby you and explain everything, but it all fits together and loose ends aren't stuck straggling behind at the end trying to play catch up.

I was surprised to see a familiar face playing the central character of the movie. It was Mads Mikkelson whom I've seen playing the role of Kaecilius in Doctor Strange. Yes, he indeed showcased an introverted yet natural portrayal of a middle-class school teacher who is struggling to get out of his banality and to get back to his youthly cheerfulness. He is not alone in this endeavor; he is accompanied by three of his close friends. The scenes reminded me of the picturesque cityscape portrayed in Manchester by the Sea which is also set in a coastal fishing area. The film was presenting the slices of lives picturized as if the cinematographer has been literally spying on their lives. The warm tone of the film helps us to immerse ourselves into the deeper shelves of human emotions and dwell on them for a few moments. This also corroborated by tight close-up shots detailing every frown and even an eye wink adding up to the emotional vocabulary. The banal theme is given a fresh touchup with impeccable detailing of the personal and professional lives of four friends. Even though the entire storyline is revolving around these alcohol consumption experiments and their fatal outcomes, it holds on to another set of midlife crises like loneliness and the burden of responsibilities.

Mads Mikkelsen in this film shines again with a dramatic role, as in The Hunt, and shows us again that in these dramatic roles, he is one of the best actors of this century; Within the cast of this film there are only great actors, who in most scenes you can sense what's is going through their heads just by looking at his face and the micro expressions they make.
It is just fantastic.
The film is not boring at any time, I even assure you that you will laugh; So the rhythm is fast and precise, it does not pause to show things that are not interesting or that do not contribute anything to the story, and obviously we must highlight the photography that there are of these exotic cities in Denmark ... Until.
The third act at first was a bit strange to me, after that tragic thing that happened, because the film could have ended perfectly there, with the message of anti-alcohol consumption, but that did not happen.
The boys graduated and the three friends end up ""happy"" leaving aside what happened before. I was wondering why?
Until I understood that in the end nothing matters, the world keeps turning and the decisions you make will always be affected by the mood with which you face every day, you are the only one who can make a change and alcohol though give you force, it will not always be there.
Martin knew that his life in the end is changin,Martin knew that his life is finally changing, he was reconciling with his wife after so long.

There are top tier films about alcoholism or addiction problems in general like, The Shining, Requiem For A Dream, Trainspotting, or 21 Grams, where we can see addiction is the villain. Another Round frames alcohol as a protagonist. It is vulnerable with its initial reputation but we just fall for it when we see it becoming a friend of lonely sad people, helping them become a fun version of themselves. Vinterberg makes sure that this contrast remains visible along the story with honest consequences, keeping this drama ride steady in an original plot away from naivety or cliches.The cinematography, production design and costumes are elegant. The editing is just brilliant. Great casting, and there were many touching moments with different characters, but with much focus on ""Martin"" played by Mads Mikkelsen. If Mikkelsen were to be replaced by any other actor the film would still be good but with him being there he makes the film superb.Vinterberg makes great use of Mads natural talent as an actor and a performer from the beginning to the very last scene when they pull one of the greatest performances of all time.",Another Round

Nikolaj has marital issues too and he's just an exhausted father, i guess? And the last guy? Did we ever even see his house? It felt like a super long trailer for another film in which they actually address who all these characters are.

283,simonwoodhart,Skol?,7,5 January 2021,"I had a few misgivings about watching this film as someone who has not had a sip of alcohol in over six months. Would it trigger me into drinking? Would it portray drinking in a positive light? Obviously I threw my doubts aside and watched it and I am glad I did. This film primarily tells the tale of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is going through the motions of life. He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn Skårderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture). For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad. Certainly you view tragedy born from over imbibing, but then it shows that there are some positives. For someone like me who wishes to moderate but can't and wants a binary judgement, this rubs me the wrong way.",Another Round

285,david_jinkins,A drunken apology,8,11 October 2020,"Another Round is a protest film. The film protests against prohibitionism. Denmark has a culture of drinking. Traditionally Danes drink when they are celebrating, and they drink to break the ice. Having a beer with a working lunch would not have raised an eyebrow as little a decade or two ago. It isn't uncommon for highschoolers to drink heavily on weekends. A Swedish character in the film says, 'everyone in this country drinks too much.'But Danish drinking is on the decline. Today Danes buy half as much alcohol per person as they did twenty years ago (based on my own calculations from Denmark Statistics). In the last six years I have been at Copenhagen Business School, the university has banned drinking on campus except with special permission, and more or less eliminated Intro Week, a heavy drinking series of ice breaking events which is tradition at Danish universities.The film is about four high school teachers who only go through the motions work, and are unsatisfied with their home lives. When the main character Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) asks his wife if he has become boring, her evasive answer tells him all he needs to know. Early in the film one of the teachers quotes Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skaaderud, that people are born with a bit too little alcohol in their blood. Martin sneaks some vodka into the school the next day, and his teaching goes much better than usual. The friends meet again, and decide to use themselves as test subjects for Skaaderud's theory.It isn't only the characters who are intrigued with the hypothesis that alcohol can improve our lives. Thomas Vinterberg, the director and co-screen writer, is completely on board. The film is a paean to how drinking can make us more fun and more interesting. It makes the teachers more creative and braver. It reduces students' anxiety. It reignites the characters' dying romantic relationships, and strengthens their bonds with friends.There is, of course, another side of alcohol, as the characters find out when they up their doses. Alcohol is associated with crimes of many sorts, from petty crime like vandalism to violent crimes like assault. Drunk driving makes roads less safe. We all know people whose lives have been destroyed by too much drinking. The economist and cultural critic Tyler Cowen has written that it is appalling that we drink such a dangerous substance in front of our children.Another Round does not ignore the negative consequences of alcoholism. Later in the film, alcohol causes some serious consequences for one of the characters. But for the most part alcohol does not create problems for the characters as much as solve them. Heavy drinking is like a coming of age ceremony. Not everyone who goes through it comes out unharmed, but those that do are changed for the better. The thesis of the film, in a word, is that alcohol is good for people, most of the time.The film is worth a view, if for nothing other than the provocative point it makes. It does not hurt that Mads Mikkelsen's performance is spectacular, as we have come to expect. So, do as the rest of the audience in the Danish movie screening I saw did, and watch the film with a beer in hand. Will drinking benefit your experience? Probably.",Another Round

I'd turn to alcoholism too if i had to spend my days with such a terribly dull person). Extra slow-scenes filled with trivial dialogue that leads nowhere.

308,yhufhei,Druk is another impactful and entertaining piece by thomas vinterberg,8,21 December 2020,"As a tribute to the premise of this film. I am reviewing this movie drunk. I have drunk one cup of gin and 3 cups of whiskey, hopefully thats around the 0.5% blood alcohol level that's significant to the point of this film. This film, like many of other Vinterberg's films, is drenched with realism and emotions as he effectively presents a family drama with the comedic premise of a group of goons drinking to the point of 0.5% BAC (blood alcohol content) to see if it betters their ""social and professional performance"". This film has the most visually appealing cinematography in Vinterberg's filmography (considering that I have only seen the Celebration and the Hunt HAHAHHAH). Everything you love about Vinterberg is present here, the realistic acting, the constant handheld yet effective shot composition present, the awkwardness and the unsettling mood that permeates the concepts that Vinterberg explores. In my interpretation, this film is exploring whether it is good/right to have a form of escapism for one's reality in order to improve one's life as a whole. The commentary on alcoholism is just superficial. This movie is examining inherently flawed characters that have made long-lived mistakes in their lives that have made them miserable, and they are striving for a solution to change it, and questionably rationalize it with the scientific foundation of Skaaderud's theory when it can be easily seen as an excuse to drink alcohol to evade life's challenges and relish an out-of-world sensation only possible with the elusive effects of booze.While at times the presentation of its message and thematic concern may seem obvious or pandering, it effectively showcases rich characterization from the likes of Mads Mikkelsen and others like Thomas Bo Larsen & Magnus Milang. It also alludes to and showcases everyday conflicts that resonates with pretty much everyone: the sense of inadequateness and the loss of interaction in long term relationships. It may not be as subtle as his other masterpieces, but to me it is a delectable addition to his repertoire. I strongly recommend this to the fans of his work. And if you are not one, you should watch this and then watch the Hunt, so that you would realize what a BEAST this Danish filmmaker is in his own right.In my drunken stupor, I shall now end my review. Hopefully this review is enough to intrigue you. If not, I shall make another review while sober to attract more attention MUAHAHAHA.",Another Round

We watched this movie expecting some laughs, and there is none.

This was obviously not going to work out and was just plain silly - turning all four into uninteresting idiots for me.The only interesting aspect left of the movie after that point was to see whether they learned something from their ""experiment"" and maybe some message to the audience regarding alcohol consumption. Not so! The movie ends ***spoler alert ** with the wife wanting to get back to the husband (why did she want to get back to the drunkard??), and instead of appreciating his good fortune and taking a final farewell to alcohol the movie ends with the main character getting drunk yet again and dancing around drunkenly and happy.There is no message here. No deeper meaning. Just four miserable idiots looking for an easy answer to improve their lives. They don't find it through drinking, one of their friends drinks himself to death, their lives only got worse and STILL they end up drinking and partying at the end.If anything, this movie is a tribute to alcohol and might even send a message that alcohol is a good thing.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I love Mikkelsens acting.",Another Round

And if that's the case, why we choose to drink up our problems instead of facing ourselves and going to therapy?Yes, Vinterberg questions the drinking culture in his country, Denmark, but I think is something a bit universal. The drinking culture is also strongly present in Mexico. I find more interesting the portrait that Vinterbeg does between young people and middle age: why the young ones seem to be happy drinking, while the old ones seem to use the alcohol as a cope mechanism? I think that as we grow up, our problems do too. And frequently, we failed to face does difficulties. We feel anguish and a constant fear of failing not only ourselves, but the others around us -like the family. Somehow, every year that pass by our responsabilities and problems get bigger.

328,maralwagner,Beautiful filmmaking but lacks insight,6,25 December 2020,"I felt compelled to write a review as a longtime admirer of Mads Mikkelsen and Vinterberg as well as having strong opinions about alcohol. Vinterberg makes beautiful movies and Mads is compelling to watch, as always. The movie starts out so promising, we're drawn into the world of these characters who feel they're missing something in life and turn to alcohol as a solution. But as the movie progresses, the story doesn't. I was waiting for it to go somewhere and maybe show that one can find that relaxation and joy within themselves and not need alcohol. Instead it takes a predictable turn without further insight into the conflict within each character. To me it seems they attempted to make a movie about alcohol culture without any insight. Considering the amount of suffering and deaths alcohol causes, it ends up feeling hollow like the message is: ""hey, alcohol can be bad so don't drink too much but look how fun it is to party!""",Another Round
329,davidfeldman-74268,Undeveloped,2,15 April 2021,"I can enjoy realism, fantasy, fable and even fairytale, but each of those genres implies a contract with the audience who agree to suspend judgement in exchange for having the film deliver in ways that it otherwise couldn't. Another Round veers between those genres and I found myself alternately suffering lack of imagination in the name of verisimilitude and lack of plausibility in the name of a jimmy-rigged premise. Many crucial developments happen off camera, things the viewer ""doesn't need to see,"" but I never discerned what made many of the things we do to see necessary to see (except perhaps that they were simply easier to stage and film). Chekhov said ""One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep."" Watching the first hour of this film you know ""this can't end well,"" and if that promise isn't completely broken, it's delivered in bad faith - a disaster that serves as a pretense for a celebration.I'm not a reviewer who needs a film to agree with me about the issues, I don't need to like any of the characters, I don't need to see the wicked punished, etc. But I don't like feeling manipulated, and I tend not to like story telling that uses people (here Tommy particularly, but also Anika) as props.",Another Round

335,Dorsa_k,not sure what this movie is trying to say,3,8 February 2021,"I think the title says it all. I'm giving the 3 stars SOLELY because of Mikkelsen's dance scene.
starting with the very premise of the script, which is to investigate the influence of alcohol on social behavior.
I'm not going to get into how they ""conduct research"" without any kind of control groups, or even taking into account their individual physiology for alcohol consumption (maybe not all of them have the 0.05% tolerance). I simply cannot understand what was their point.What did they consider as an optimum behavior (that alcohol facilitated)? Mikkelsen gets drunk pretty fast in their first day of trial, but later leads an incredible class compared to his boring lectures. For him, optimum behaviour is not being boring. Almost similarly, but to a much lesser degree, Lars Ranthe's problem (Peter) 'sounded' more tangible. However, again, not enough is told about him to make us sympathize with him.What about for the other two? Does Magnus Milang's character (Nikolaj) tolerate his miserable family life better? Does Thomas Bo Larsen (Tommy) gets better at couching? what are these men trying to achieve?another point is the character built. the subtle way of introducing their lives is ok, but Not for Tommy. what does he die in the end anyways? We don't know enough about his motifs and life ""miseries"" that he is trying to get better at to understand why he ""is game"" when they are trying to reach the oblivion stage.Another point was Mikkelsen's domestic problems. I would have preferred if there was a better arc in their marriage problems and resolution. I simply don't believe it was elaborate enough.All in all, I would say I liked the song and the dance scene much better when I was not aware of how empty this story was.",Another Round

Everyone has a hope now, Nikolaj's life with his wife is getting better and he is not wetting the bed anymore :'D Peter started dating and was so emotional seeing the love of his students, Martin is supposedly back with anika and has a chance to get things right.Mads Mikkelsen with a stunning performance and a beautiful dancing scene at the end, I also can't neglect his fellow teachers in the movie, they were all amazing and I enjoyed every scene of them together.",Another Round

Another round is about the longing for youth, and looking for genuine emotion and connection in life. The movie encapsulates the reason we need to fail, and fail again, until something changes. Do we all succeed? Of course not, ie their friend that died. And of course drinking shouldn't be the motivation in life, but in their experiment they found new life within the moments when they were sober, in the moments when they felt most alive. It's only in the last moments where martin feels most down, and that his last attempt to save his marriage succeeded, allowing him to freely dance for the first time in years, not needing the alcohol to feel that way, but because he now feels fully alive and himself, it's time for another round.

Perhaps 'dram-com' is the most apt category available for the convenience of the nextflix algorithm, but this really isn't that-neither is it a tragedy only, or a drama. It is irreverent.
Perhaps it's important that I preface by saying I'm a 25 y.o. American, which might give you a rough idea of my cinematic purview. I've seen few foreign films which have stuck with me, among them Babette's Feast and, to a lesser degree, Oslo, August 31st. This is more alike the latter (albeit not so morbidly depressing). To avoid spoilers and still make a point I'd like to make, I think it's noble of the director to steer clear of chauvinism, despite that the more negative professional reviews such as that from The Guardian insist to focus on what they deem a 'pro-alcohol' message. If the director has any predilection he's trying to share, it's that life is worth enjoying, even if that means taking the forbidden sip or two. There's no patronizing here-just an honest character study, the four-man cast cornering four primary and different character traits, at least one of which nearly all of us will share.
To get back to the comedy thing, it is a joyful and funny movie (albeit equally dark and poignant). But it doesn't demand laughter or tears. The subtle grace with which Druk progresses unconcernedly has that distinctive European feel, and it is a refreshing respite from the formulaic stories we are used to being told. (The underlying story itself here is simple, predictable and cliche, but that doesn't matter-life itself is as much, yet as a richly lived day, though predictable in its broad turns, shimmers with many uncontrived moments of triumph and novelty, so does this movie progress-generally as expected, yet in a strangely inverted, paradoxically novel way.)

Whereas Thomas Vinterberg wished for a celebration of life, he achieved a glorification of alcohol.SPOILERS AHEAD
This is what the movie literally tells us: Drink alcohol to be at the top of your game professionally and in your personal life, and alcohol will even make you succeed at exams. Only a gross overconsumption of alcohol or alcoholism may be detrimental. May only though, as the best politicians and artists were alcoholics, and those who do not drink are Nazis... The woman subjected to alcohol fuelled domestic violence will take a glass of white wine when facing the abuser, before running back to him. Being sick from excessive alcohol consumption or running drunk into traffic is fun and harmless, and the final still image of the movie tells us that alcohol sets us free.Clearly the movie does not have the ambition to curb heavy drinking among Danish youth. It rather resemble the movie of a high-functioning alcoholic who would absolve himself of all guilt and even try to convince you that alcohol will make you a better person, and will make the society better too.

373,movie-magnet,A Stunning Storyline and Acting - and not just Mikkelsen,9,20 August 2021,"Four ""middle-aged"" teachers and friends decide to test a Darwinian hypothesis - to keep their Blood Alcohol Content above 0.05%. All men take it differently, which leads to mixed results. Especially Mikkelsen, to whom the mid-life crisis seems to be the most confrontational is at risk of going beyond the edge. However, it is not Martin (Mikkelsen) to whom the drinking is proving fatal, but Tommy.That is where the philosopher Kierkegaard comes in. Entering a midlife crisis brings anxiety and feelings of failure, overcoming it (or at least, coming at terms with it) is about accepting the subjectivity of these feelings. And only by acknowledging this, can the anxiety be countered. Mikkelsen plays a brilliant role in a man who discovers this - and who realizes that the ""experiment"" was just a metaphor for getting out of his midlife crisis, which requires something far more substantial than alcohol.But it is not just Mikkelsen who plays a brilliant role. Lars Ranthe - Peter - did a wonderful job in playing an intimate professor who passionately wants to see his students succeed, and Thomas Bo Larsen - Tommy - gives a raw performance of a friend who cannot separate reality from a game anymore. And such brilliant filming from the director who has been partly responsible for Dogme 95, which outlines that the camera must be hand- held: whenever there is alcohol involved, the camera becomes slightly unsteady, giving the spectator a feeling of having consumed a (small) absinth.

379,hyper_lund,Kierkegaard is the key,8,13 October 2020,"I went to watch this movie, hoping it wouldn't be either moralizing or celebrating of Danish drinking-culture - and fortunately it delivered!
Well I don't believe it was fortune or luck, but rather a deeply thought through film from Vinterberg. Before I went to watch it I saw a couple of interviews with the director to get a grasp of his vision. He emphasized that the quote at the beginning was in many ways the key to understand the film itself.
""What is youth? A dream. What is love? The dream's content"" - Kierkegaard
Thus it is not so much about drinking, but rather it tackles the reason for all the drinking. It is about the longing for youth - a state of hope, love and vitality. We long to live life to its fullest, but we seem unable to embody that in our own lives, so we succumb to cheap methods, such as drinking. Notice how throughout the movie there is an underlying sense of depression and misery, especially in the character Martin. He attempts to fix his whole life through drinking, and it initially works, but he is unable to control it. It is not untill the last moments, where his whole life is in ruins, and his alienated wife finally admits that she still misses him that hope shines on him. Only then can he dance!
It shows us how hope, love and vitality isn't found at the bottom of a bottle, it is found in our most meaningful relationships and our endeavors to hold on to them! It isn't the beer that enables him in the end, it is that text from Anika.
Thus we see that drinking can be a wonderful thing as well, as long as it isn't the very thing that keeps us going in itself (Tommy's demise!). It is love and courage and daring to fail and to fall that should be our driving force, and sometimes that one drink can be the little nudge we need to embody these ideals (the student at the exam - about Kierkegaard!!), but it shouldn't be at the center of our motivation in life.",Another Round

386,vaibhav-47261,"Mads Mikkelsen, take a bow",9,30 May 2021,"""You must accept yourself as fallible in order to love others and life.""Another Round (Danish title: Druk), this year's Oscar Winner for Best International Feature Film by Thomas Vinterberg, is a cinematic experience on another level. It's a story of four friends dealing with mid life crisis and their reliance on alcohol as their savior.Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), Tommy, Nikolaj, and Peter are all fighting their demons - failing marriages, loneliness, careers going downhill and most of all, the sinking feeling of losing youth. Impressed by the untested per mille theory, they decide to maintain a constant blood alcohol concentration at all times hoping to turn things around one glass at a time. Things change, unexpectedly and uncontrollably, in both directions. It eventually boils down to their ability to deal with the consequences while they constantly strive to take it a notch higher. Contrary to the popular criticism, I don't think it preaches alcoholism. It just doesn't give an opinion - it's neither moralistic nor an alcohol advert.Having watched ""The Hunt"" (yet another Vinterberg epic) and amid all the Oscar hype, I had high expectations from the movie and it didn't let me down. Beautifully shot and backed by exceptional performances, it isn't just about alcohol but is more about life and freedom and what it takes to control the change. Mads Mikkelsen is at his absolute best. He just doesn't need words to express. Don't expect a plain comedy.. it's equal parts funny, touching and heartbreaking. The last scene is pure bliss and leaves an indelible impression - the soundtrack 'What a Life' is bound to hit your playlists.Do yourself a favor and watch it now.",Another Round

389,Laugk,Charming yet incredibly predictable movie,6,28 September 2020,"The concept of the movie is funny. Four friends becomes inspired by a philosopher who proposes that the human condition is slightly too sober. To test this theory, they try to live a tipsy life .Apart from the funny concept, the movie is void of surprises. The men are depicted as ordinary with ordinary problems. They are in their forties, they are either missing the life before children or regretting never having them, they don't pay suffient attention to their romantic relationships, they are uinspiring teachers at a high school where all the kids would rather stare at their screens... And their resort to escape this reality is alcohol.Their situation surely might be relatable, but it's also incredibly cliche. The dramatic curve is also entirely predictable.They drink alcohol and suddenly turn into sublime teachers who are saluted by cheering teenagers. They pay attention to their partners. Everything is swell.The drink more alcohol, and things turn even better, but the movie hints that we might be approaching hybris.They drink even more alcohol and their situation turn misrable. Who would have been able to predict that?The movie suffers from this predictability throughout. To give another example: In a scene, one of the characters (I can't remember the name, apart from Mads Mikkelsens excellent performance, the characters are rather - yes - ordinary) exclaims: ""I wish I had children, no one will remember me as i grow old."" In the very next scene, the character meets a distressed high school student and they develop a memorable relationship. What a ride!I could keep on listing several similiar examples, but that would spoil the movie.I guess the movie is daring in that it celebrates alcohol and alcohol culture in a Danish society that frown upon teenagers' (hefty) alcohol consumption. If you are one to get provoked by a celebration of drugs and the proposition that drugs (such as alcohol) might be a helpful aid in living a more inspired life, then this movie might shock you and/or give you a few new ideas.Since that thought does not provoke me in any particular way, I was left unfrazzled.It's a weird take on a feel good movie. There's alot of warmth but not a whole lot of depth.If you feel like watching a feel good comedy with a novel concept about a stereotypical group of male friends that realise that alcoholism in fact does not fix their existential problems, knock yourself out. If you want to be provoked, touched, surprised, inspired - then I don't think this is it.",Another Round

392,anders-23626,Alcohol,7,18 October 2020,"An extraordinary depiction of what alchohol can and cannot do. How it can help you and how it can fail you.
This movie is not a celebration of alcohol nor a ""Don't you are drink that""-speach. It just pictures different aspects of alcohol with which the viewer can do as he/she wants.Outstanding performances by the actors, especially Mads Mikkelsen.The handheld camera, classic Thomas Vinterberg, gives a lot to the dynamic of this picture, great cinematography.The sound department also did a great job, especially in the final scene, amazing.Finally a big, fat thumbs up to the castingpeople and the costume designers who managed to picture Danish high school teachers and students as the actually look and behave in real life. Very realistic in that way.",Another Round
393,archkidz,Am I Missing Something?,7,16 March 2021,"SPOILERS:
I agree this is a very good movie but I am shocked at how many reviews mention how funny it is-I found it mostly sad! And the ending has me confused. I thought they were going to tone down the drinking after Tommy's death, and Martin's wife saw him sober at their last meeting. I assumed that was one of the reasons she decided to take him back. But when he finds that out, he continues to drink and dances that incredible dance at the end, and that tells me he's choosing alcohol over her. Most reviews here talk about a happy ending, but I thought it was tragic that he chose to drink instead of saving his marriage.",Another Round
394,pandeyshubh,What a life!,8,21 September 2021,"The movie is about four friends who also happen to be colleagues teaching in the same school. As they are all going through a midlife crisis, one fine day at dinner at a restaurant, they decide to go on a routine of drinking daily, but just about 0.05% alcohol to meet the deficit that the human body naturally has. From there on, the movie is a roller-coaster ride filled with excitement , fun, folly and also some introspection towards the end, when they realise the folly of their plan.The movie is an easy watch and never tries to be either preachy or apologetic about the subject. I enjoyed it till the end, but the last 3 minutes where Mads Mikkelsen gives his impromptu dance performance was a real cherry on the cake. Go watch it for the sheer joy of being adults who want to enjoy life to the fullest and aren't shy of being juvenile about it😊",Another Round

402,taobox,This is 100% true to life,10,15 April 2021,"I did something I've never done before: I watched this movie twice, two nights in a row. I wasn't bored at any time and thoroughly enjoyed every moment, even the second time. Some reviewers here have found the plot to be boring and predictable. I pity them for not being able to switch off their analytical mind and simply enjoy a really well done movie.Yes, the acting is excellent and the direction and cutting is so to the bone precise. But the thing that makes this movie a gem is that it is 100% true to life! I can say that with confidence because I am Danish middle class myself; I went to college (way back) and I even had two alcoholic teachers (one of whom stepped out in front of a cargotruck during my time there).We have a 20 year old granddaughter, whose afterparty after graduating we attended two years ago ... and we saw first hand the young peoples heavy drinking. It was totally excessive, but this is their life, not ours (- yes, I'm Danish; I know and trust they will find their way). I was moved by these young peoples (most of whom we hadn't met before) kindness, openness and trust towards us, who are 40 years older than them. This generational trait was also shown in the film, in their relation with their teachers. There is a lot of trust and goodness there - which makes me hopeful for the future!And the depiction of the friendship of the four male main characters was spot on: They are best friends, yet they are quite private and holding back about the real pains of their lives. And typically Scandinavian, they need to become a little tipsy before opening up. And when they in the movie do open up a little, you see the warm support of their friends - never overly emotional or verbally drilling into the core of what the pain is about. Just a few words - in the movie: ""Did you ever consider finding someone else?"" The love for each other is there as a subtle undercurrent. This is usually how male, Scandinavian friendship is - unlike female friendships where support in such situations is much more verbally expressive and psychotherapeutic ... and oftentimes also more condemning of the behaviour of their men (justified, they would no doubt argue ;-)And the depiction of how our Scandinavian lifestyle, with all its correctness, good intentions and responsible behaviour, risks sucking out all of lifes spontaneity and juiciness, is also spot on. If you want to get a feeling of what our culture is like, in good and bad, go see this movie!In Druk Thomas Vinterberg - while acknowledging the destructiveness of alcoholism - celebrates the qualities of being a little tipsy. You may or may not agree with this. That doesn't detract from this being what it is: An absolutely brilliant movie!",Another Round
